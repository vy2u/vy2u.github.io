another one of my makeup stash videos or
my makeup collection videos I haven't
posted one of these videos in months I
had no idea it had been that long and I
went to search up my last collection
video and I was like oh my gosh when did
I stop doing these so today's video is
gonna be on my drugstore highlights I
have so many highlights and going
through every single one would be
ridiculous this video is probably
already ridiculously long so I am
splitting them up and today we're
talking about my drugstore highlighter
collection before I made such a dramatic
pause on these videos my last video I'm
pretty sure it was showing you my
concealers my beauty creams and my
tension voice risers and all of that and
I kind of walked you through this side
of my vanity the three drawers that are
right here and now we are gonna be
tackling this drawer which I've done
videos on this drawer since I started my
channel but things are constantly
changing in my makeup collection I'm so
excited to show you my affordable
highlighter collection not all of these
are from the drugstore there are some
color pop highlights in my collection
and I would not consider those drugstore
but they are so affordable they kind of
fall in that category but anyway I'm
gonna show you all the highlights and
I'm gonna swatch them all on my hand for
you and we're just gonna discuss them I
mean who doesn't like an affordable
highlight I know I do and they're not
always great some drugstore highlights
can be kind of chalky I'm just not good
but the highlights I'm gonna share with
you guys I have I just love them they're
really great especially for the price
but I'm gonna go into details now so
anyway if you want to see my affordable
highlighter collection then just keep
watching okay so here's my vanity I film
sitting right here and this is the
drawer that is like right behind me when
I'm filming and if you have been
subscribed to me for a really really
long time you have seen this time and
time again affordable bronzers
affordable blushes and affordable
highlights we will be focusing on this
drawer but if you want to see a video on
the blushes or the bronzers let me know
in the comments below okay so I got
these little compact organizers from by
allegory I believe you can also get
these on Amazon and as you can see a lot
of them don't fit into these little
things some of these have difficult
packaging you know but for the most part
most compacts do fit in these little
organizers
I'm gonna start with these and then I
will make my way around the drawer I
have two elf baked highlighters this one
is technically a baked blush but I mean
it's very much a highlight and I have a
love-hate relationship with these I do
really love them but you have to scratch
off the first layer of this product in
order to get that highlight to show
through because it has a weird coating
on these that gives you absolutely no
color payoff so you have to sit there
with something and like really scratch
off the top layer and once you do that
they work and I know that's annoying I
shouldn't have to do that with a product
but these are so cheap I don't mind I
have moonlight pearls and pink tastic
pink tastic is definitely my favorite
it's a lot more wet looking like more
highlighting so pretty I have this
wedding Wild mega cushion highlight
illuminator that I am in love with I
have to say out of all the cream
highlights I've tried from the drugstore
this one is like one of my favorites if
not my favorite it looks extremely pink
here in the cushion but it's not I mean
it's pink but it has a very slight
pearly iridescent to it it looks so
beautiful on the skin it really does
give you that glow from within look it's
not hard to use it's so easy to work
with easy to blend I love this product
and I hope they come out with new colors
because I feel like they've only had
this one for a really long time by the
way this one is called who's that pearl
and it is gorgeous
please come out with more shades wet and
wild Milani has these strobe light
powders that are really really good I
used to have the gold one when I
recently we did like a highlighter purge
and declutter oh I did with all my
makeup I got rid of the gold one I was
just using this one more I really wasn't
using the gold one at all but this one
is in the shade afterglow and it's such
a pretty color it's like a natural pinky
pearl the the pink undertone isn't very
strong so it looks really pretty on the
skin and it's actually one of those
highlights that looks really natural but
if you build it up a lot you can get a
really intense glow so I really like
this one I hate doing swatches on my
hands because I feel like I have bony
webbed like bones I have four of the Wet
n Wild mega glow highlighting powders
they have a couple of other shades but I
find some of these to be very
hit-or-miss
I mean most of them are hits for me but
there are a few shades that are really
dusty and really glittery honestly don't
like those at all but these four are
excellent I love them my
recommend them my favorite one is
blossom glow all of these have a
gorgeous metallic reflective wet finish
I love them blossom glow it's a really
pretty pinky champagne pearly shade
golden flower crown is a nice gold color
this one is a little bit less metallic
than the others it's just a little bit
more natural but it still has that
really pretty gold reflect then you have
precious petals which is like the
original one I fell in love with it was
one of the first ones that came out and
it is gorgeous
and then I have botanic dream which does
look a bit too dark for me but I just
love how metallic and gorgeous this is
that I keep it around because I just I
want to use it for something but I love
these they're amazing I keep this
eyeshadow in my drugstore highlighter
door because it's from jcat and I
honestly use this for highlight it's
probably one of my favorite affordable
highlights ever it is the jcat triple
crown baked shadow in the shade dulce de
leche and it is beautiful you have three
different shades and you could use them
individually or just mix them together I
like to mix them together that's my
favorite way to apply it but it's so
metallic and beautiful oh my god I love
it if you're in Ulta and you see j-cap
baked shadows pick this one up carp have
released a few of these pressed powder
face highlighters and most of them I did
give away to my friends and my family
but I did keep my favourite one it's
called here kitty kitty this one is
absolutely beautiful color pop powder
highlighters are very hit-or-miss
some of them are exceptional and like
really amazing and then some of them are
like glittery and chunky this one in
here kitty-kitty is beautiful I love it
has such a strong reflect if you want to
be glowing in the night this one is
definitely one you want to put on your
face I have my good old essence pure
note highlighter you guys have seen this
on my channel about a trillion times I
love this this is hands-down the best
natural highlight ever I wouldn't need
okay it is a highlight but it's more of
a highlight for your entire face you can
build this up and get a nice look to the
top of the cheekbones but it's gonna be
a very natural look I like if you're
naturally dewy and glowy from within I
have this all over my face in the intro
of this video I'm wearing another
highlighter today on the top of my
cheekbones but this stuff is pretty much
all over my face I love dusty mists on
the face especially over matte
foundations it just gives your skin such
a natural youthful glow I love the
stuff word on the street is that they
discontinued this or something like that
I hope that's not true because this is
literally the best the best natural
highlighter ever and it's the cheapest I
am in love with this if you can't
already tell I have these two pixie
highlighters in collaboration with Aspen
art i have the santorini sunset and the
london lustre these are their glowy
powders i love these they're both really
really pretty i recommend both of them
if you are very very fair this one in
London luster is gorgeous on the cheeks
the santorini sunset one almost has kind
of like a dual chrome to it it's gold
but it has that peachy pink vibe to it
it's so pretty on the cheeks and yes I
love these I have one of these makeup
revolution vivid baked highlighters this
one is not like my absolute favorite but
I don't dislike it so I don't want to
give it away you know what I mean like I
use it from time to time it's just not
the best in this collection it's a very
natural highlighter it's not too
metallic or intense so if you're looking
for something a little bit more natural
but one that still gives you a nice pop
to the cheeks I really recommend this
one
this next one I've had for a really
really long time I don't know if I
should get rid of it but I mean it's
still going strong it's still working
this is such a great highlight and I
never hear anyone talking about it this
is the natural nude highlight from
Physicians Formula I love it because you
get a ton of different colors in this
and you can really customize your shade
if you want something really gold and
bronzy you can hit it towards the bottom
or if you want something really really
pale you can tackle this area and I just
love how intense this highlight is like
this is metallic like this is a
highlighter guys extremely creamy the
formula on this one is really really
great I highly recommend this one as
well okay so those were all the
highlights here in this area I keep
these little potted highlights here off
to the side because I really don't know
how to store them I have three color
crop ones and three of these new
Physicians Formula butter highlights cuz
I have a whole video on these so I don't
want to go into too much detail but
they're nice they're really pretty they
give a beautiful glow to the cheeks but
I don't know if they're worth the money
they kind of have a strange formula and
the more I play around with them the
more I'm unsure and then like I said I
have three of the colour-pop super
shocked highlighters
I actually just replace this one this
one is called wisp and my old wisp was
looking crazy
so now
have a new one but I have wisp
flexitarian and smoke and whistles these
are the ones that I kept after my purge
I just have so many highlighters
drugstore in high ends these three are
my favorite smoking whistles has like
that pinky undertone but it looks so
pretty on the cheeks wisp is great if
you have medium skin tones has a
beautiful golden undertone and it looks
really reflective but my favorite one
hands-down has to be flexitarian I think
this is the best super shock cheek
they've ever come out with whenever I do
my kale polish photo shoots this is like
always on my cheeks and this is also the
highlight I'm wearing in the intro of
this video it has that pearl undertone
so it's perfect for a fair skin and it
looks so intense on the cheeks but it
makes your cheeks look wet like ah so
delicious I love this one of the best
color pop products ever I'm obsessed I
have this wet and wild color icon
highlight and reserve your cabana it's
very similar to this essence pure nude
highlighter but it's not as pretty like
it's not as glowy and natural-looking
and I use it in the exact same way I use
this dusted all over the face when I
want a nice natural glow this one is a
little bit lighter though so if you're
very very very fair this one would suit
you better
I have the ever-so-popular sleek
solstice palette this is a very
beautiful palette I think it does
deserve all the hype it gets the only
thing is I only get use out of one of
these shades and it's this one right
here this cream highlight is really
pretty too though it's just a little bit
too intense for my skin tone like it
shows up on the skin you see a stripe on
the face and the one under it is pretty
good too I just really don't reach for
it and this one is the one I use the
least very very intense has an
incredible Sheen but I just I never wear
purple highlight you know this color I
really like it has a nice peachy
undertone looks so pretty in the summer
makes your cheeks look really wet and
intense a little goes a very long way
with this product do not apply too much
because you will look crazy if you just
use a light hand you get a super
metallic look but it looks really pretty
I love it a palette I'm not so loving I
mean I'm I am loving but not like so
loving this is the wet and wild my glow
highlighting palette not like I said
earlier some
these highlights are hits and misses for
me and I have to say three out of four
of these are misses these two on the
bottom are misses because they're just a
little bit too glittery for me and I
don't wear colors like this on the face
and then the only reason this one is
amiss is because I don't wear blue
highlight I mean it would look really
cool for like a mermaid makeup tutorial
or something fun like that's something
unique and cool and out of the box and
yeah it's amazing because the formula on
this blue one is also the only one I
reach for and the only one I wear is
this one I'm in the top corner no
glitter nice Sheen I really love that
one but I don't know if the whole
palette is worth it if I'm just gonna be
using one shade you know another one
wild highlight I love so much is this
one in boozy brunch all the colors
combined makes such a nice highlight
it's a really pretty gold with that
pinky undertone I look stunning on the
cheeks and I highly recommend checking
this one out next time you're shopping
at Walgreens or something this one is so
pretty so before we get into the liquid
highlights I have two more powders these
are the makeup revolution triple baked
highlighters these are pretty much
knockoffs of the Too Faced highlighters
or two-faced baked blushes they come in
these little hearts but these are
highlights and I have goddess of love
and goddess of faith if I had to just
keep one I would keep goddess of faith I
think that one is a little bit more
natural I think that one is a little bit
more flattering it looks better on my
skin tone goddess of love has like that
strong pink undertone that could look a
little bit unnatural on the skin but
they both have a really nice formula
it's a baked product so it looks really
smooth on the skin it's not too chunky I
really like the formula on these and
then these are all the cream liquid
highlights I have I have this NYX dose
of do face gloss this one comes in like
a stick form I've actually never tried
this one on my face it's been sitting
here for a little bit and I don't know
why I haven't tried it yet but I
definitely should I really they call
this one swatches on the skin and I'm
really excited to use it on the face
hopefully it's not like sticky and you
know hopefully it's good and then these
two are a little bit liquidy err this
one is the NYX born took low liquid
illuminator and this one is the
Maybelline master strobing liquid buy
face studio and it's a
the shade light they're both very
similar but the Maybelline one kind of
has like a stronger silvery undertone
and it's a little bit more intense like
it's a little bit more reflective the
next one is just a little bit more
natural so it just depends what you're
looking for but I find that they're both
really easy to use and then believe it
or not actually I haven't tried out
these two either I just got this Catrice
liquid Luminizer strobing pen and I'm
really excited to test out this formula
when I swatch it on the back of my hand
it does I don't know what swatches a
little bit sticky like I have a feeling
I'm gonna struggle a little bit with
this formula but I don't want to jump
the gun or anything and then I have this
makeup revolution liquid highlighter and
the shade champagne and this is
basically them trying to be a cover FX
custom enhancer drop and I mean if
they're just as good that's great
because the cover effects ones are very
very pricey but I won't know until I
test it out okay guys so those are all
the highlighters in this drawer okay
guys so that completes this video these
were all of my affordable highlights I
hope this video helped you in some way

look at these highlights and maybe you
