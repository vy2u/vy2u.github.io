really exciting one for me
border is very very excited about this
video so as you guys know I've been
talking about it on snapchat and on
Instagram and mainly on Twitter but me
and colour-pop have teamed up again to
come out with a new little collection
and I am so excited about this one I've
been excited about all of them the
collection includes three ultra satin
lip ease and an eyeliner I'm gonna go
into complete detail I'm gonna talk
about the names I'm gonna talk about the
colors I'm going to swatch them I have
lip swatches for you the whole nine
yards I know a lot of you guys are
familiar with Lumiere Aquarius Taurus my
where the light is where the night is
and Lumiere - those are my collabs that
I've done with color pop in the past and
I'm so grateful for the experiences I'm
so grateful that color pop continues to
support me and to just work with me
because they are an amazing company to
work with I really love them so
affordable and so so good so when they
approached me to collab again I was
through the roof beyond excited because
they asked me to collab on products that
I think are my favorite by color pop by
far the ultra satin lip have to be my
favorite formula color pop has ever come
out with it's their newer formula it
just keep getting better and better and
the ultra satin lips are definitely
hands-down my favorite you guys know and
I rave about color pop eyeliners like I
rave about them I love them so much so
when they asked me to create an eyeliner
I was so excited actually fun fact it
was originally supposed to be three
second lips and two eyeliners but when I
got the second eyeliner in the mail and
I played around with it it was a cobalt
blue it was a beautiful cobalt blue and
I was most excited for it but the more I
played around with it it just wasn't as
pigmented on my waterline it didn't live
up to color pop eyeliner standards so we
exit out I was like I'm not gonna
release that it's not as good
so we cancelled that so we just kept one
eyeliner and three ultra satin lips and
I am so excited to share with you today
today is Monday when you're watching
this or when I upload this video and
this launches tomorrow July 12 so if you
are not watching this when I upload it
maybe they have already launched but
July 12 which is tomorrow the best part
is
colour-pop is now doing international
shipping which is huge because every
time I cut a lab with colour-pop the
number one question is when are they
gonna ship internationally I can't get
your products I'm in France I can't get
your products I'm in London like I get
so many questions asking about
International shipping and finally
finally colour-pop is shipping
internationally and they are launching
International shipping and the same day
so starting tomorrow you can get any
cult not just myself but any color pop
item shipped to you if you live outside
of the United States which is so amazing
I think I'm most excited about that
because I know it's been so requested
and so many of you are like I wish I
could get a color pop but now you
totally can you can get color pop
starting tomorrow I'm not a hundred
percent sure what time they launch
tomorrow once um the page goes up and
once it's live I will link it in this
video so just come back tomorrow and
it'll be linked down below they don't
like to discuss times so that the
website doesn't crash or anything so I
have no idea at what time it launches
okay so now that I addressed the best
part which was International shipping
let me go ahead and get into the colors
so I'm gonna start with what you guys
are probably most excited for and it is
the ultra satin lips just in case you
guys don't know the satin lips are kind
of like a liquid lipstick I'm wearing
one of the colors right now only I mixed
it with a different lip liner I will get
into that in a little bit but these
satin lips are like a liquid lipstick
and a regular lipstick hybrid they're
not as drying as their liquid lipstick
formula but they last a lot longer than
their lippie stix formula if that makes
any sense I was wearing one of the
shades yesterday all day like literally
I put it on at 10 o'clock in the morning
and I took it off at night time before
dinner like I was wearing it all day so
let me get my little wipe ready to
swatch these bad boys okay so this is
the first color and it is the lightest
color and this one is called Alyssa I
named this one Alyssa after my
goddaughter I have a rule that I do not
like to name any like collaborations
after family members because then other
family members kind of get upset if you
don't you know I don't know if any broke
that rule for Alyssa because she's like
one of my favorite humans ever one of
the sweetest smartest most amazing
little girls and I love her so much so I
decided to name this one after her if
you don't know a god it's kinda like a
Catholic thing but she is my cousin's
daughter so she's like my little cousin
she's almost nine years old and she
rocks so named this one Alyssa anyway
this is a really really pretty dusty
pink it kind of has a neutral undertone
but to me it leans on my lips it leans a
little it has like a hint of mauve in
there such a pretty dusty color I had a
sneak peek of this color a few weeks ago
but I ended up changing the color a
little bit I talked about this on
snapchat but I ended up tweaking the
color a little bit because originally
this color had a little bit too much
white in it and I was afraid it was
gonna wash some people out so I made the
color a little bit darker and now I
freaking love it I'm so glad I did this
is the perfect everyday color and what I
love is that you can do kind of like a
bold smoky eye and pair it with this lip
or you can just go bare eyes and pair it
with this lip and it always looks good
it's not too light but it's not too dark
it's so wearable I'm gonna show you a
swatch of Alyssa on the back of my hand
a huge swatch just so you guys can see
the color because even though I know lip
swatches are more helpful I still too
much I still want you to see what it
looks like swatched on the back of my
hand so it has a little bit of shine at
first but throughout the day it gets a
little bit less shiny but the color
stays there this next color is
definitely my favorite out of the three
I just I love this one so much this one
is kind of like a standard pink but not
like a Barbie pink it has kind of like a
little bit of a rose
tint to it so stunning on so many
different skin tones and I decided to
name this one November which for those
of you who don't know I was married on
November 22nd that's my anniversary so
that is why I tamed it November
this is another color that you can
definitely wear every day it's just a
little bit more bold than ELISA I love
this on medium skin tones like it's so
beautiful Amelia my best friend has a
deeper skin tone than me and this looks
stunning on her at least I think so I'm
actually thinking of doing a whole video
with Amelia where she's sitting right
next to me and we are lips watching all
of my collabs just so that you can see
how they look on my skintone and how
they look on her skin tone so definitely
let me know if that's something you're
interested in
just comment below be like yes do the
lip swatch video with Amelia we want to
see it and I will definitely do that for
you guys this is November swatch on the
back of my hand it's like a rosy pink
but there's some brightness to this like
when I put it on the lips I'm just like
ah I feel fresh and I just love this one
it's definitely my favorite I actually
brought out Lumiere 2 just to swatch it
next to November because I've gotten a
lot of questions to compare these two
they are very different though even
though they kind of look similar in the
tubes
this is an ultra matte lip it's a
completely different formula actually
I'm also going to swatch the original
Lumiere next to them as well okay so
here at the bottom we have the original
Lumiere here is Lumiere 2 and then here
is November so you can see the Lumiere's
are definitely purples or moths this one
is 8 peak ok and then the last ultra
satin lip is definitely the most unique
this one is a brown but it is a very
cool tone Brown when I last collabs
color pop and I came out with Taurus
which is a matte lip II stick it was a
very very very warm brown and then this
time around I knew that I wanted to do
another brown but I wanted it like at
the opposite end of the spectrum and I
decided to name this one point zero
which is a very weird name I know but
you guys know I have an obsession with
Paris which is what I deemed my first
collab Lumiere I always wanted to go
I've never gone there but I've always
wanted to go but you know I'm terrified
to get on a plane for that many hours
and there is something in Paris called
point zero which it's on the floor and I
believe I could be wrong but I believe
it's in front of the Notre Dame and it
is the place where all distances are
measured in Paris so it is literally the
center of Paris a lot of people go and
stand on
point zero and make wishes and stuff
like that so I thought it was a
beautiful like it's a beautiful thing if
you Google point zero it's so cool this
color reminded me for some reason of
point zero what I don't know why but I
decided to name it point zero this is
actually the lip color I'm wearing on my
lips right now but I mixed it with not
mixed it but I applied my tourist lippie
pencil underneath like my tourist lip
liner I filled in my entire lips with
the lip liner and then I went over it
with this so it creates a more neutral
Brown which I love wearing it on its own
it's my favorite way to wear it but
paired with tourist lip liner I think it
is really cool so that is the
combination on my lips right now let me
swatch it on the back of my hand so you
can see though this is point zero and
this color looks different on everyone
but I think it looks cool on everyone -
it's definitely a color for someone who
wants to wear something a little bit
more bold because it's not exactly an
everyday color or it totally can be I
would totally wear this every day but
for most people it's definitely more of
a bolder lip okay so we are almost done
now we are going to talk about these bad
boys I am obsessed you guys know I've
been obsessed been obsessed with the
color pop cream gel liners the pencils
these are my favorite eyeliners except
the black and the brown for black and
brown I love my NYX pleasure Lee
eyeliners you guys know that Brown is
kind of like a neutral dark brown this
is completely different so I wanted to
come out with a color that was brown you
know a color that a lot of people would
wear but I wanted it to be very warm
I wanted a super warm brown because they
look so pretty up against green eyes
hazel eyes blue eyes even brown eyes I
decided to name this color mister Bing
and when I said it on snapchat a lot of
you guys thought I was saying mister big
like from Sex in the City which I can
see where you get that confusion because
mr. bean sounds like mr. big but I
actually named this after Chandler from
friends friends is my all-time favorite
comedy like my all-time favorite show
hands down and I'm surprised I didn't
name a product after the show like
sooner but Chandler is my favorite
character in front
and I wanted to name it like something
to do with Chandler but not like
Chandler Bing so I named it mr. Bing and
it was so funny the way that this name
came to me I was actually watching an
episode of Friends it's in season six
and I believe it's called the one with
Rachel's sister and it's a Besson where
Monica gets sick but she's acting like
she's not sick and whatever there's a
part where she's in the room and she's
like calling doctor being talked to Bing
to the bed it just came to me I was like
I want a name my eyeliner after that but
I didn't want to name it dr. Bing
because unless you are like a die-hard
fan you know what episode I'm talking
about dr. Bing doesn't make any sense
cuz he's not a doctor but he is a mister
so I decided to go with mr. Bing what a
long story for this but whatever and
colour-pop whenever they come out with
an eyeliner or like a cream gel liner
they always make the matching pot so you
have your gel eyeliner in platform as
well these are not my absolute favorites
they are very very matte but they can be
a little drying you have to be careful
with that I have it on my eyes today I
used this as my winged liner I've been
using this for weeks now and I haven't
had any problems with them but I do have
gel pot eyeliners that I do like more as
you guys know I've reviewed these in the
past but the pencil liners like cannot
be beat in my opinion I will say though
keep in mind if you are thinking of
purchasing these this is a very warm
brown it's like a red brown and I don't
want that to scare anybody when they
think they're just buying like a plain
old Brown eyeliner no this is not a
plain old brown eyeliner this is a
special Brown eyeliner just for shits
and giggles I'm just gonna go ahead and
swatch it on the back of my hand you
guys saw it on my waterline and on my
eyeball already but just so you can have
a hand swatch as you can see a delicious
warm brown and a low 8 it's beautiful I
can't finish this video off without
saying thank you about a million times I
know this can get repetitive cuz I do
this at the end of every like collab
launch video that I filmed but I
wouldn't be doing any of this without
you guys so why would I not say thank
you I love you and thank you so so so
much everybody has people that they
don't like every
but he has people that don't like them
every youtuber here on YouTube has has
people who don't like them it's a normal
thing you're not gonna love everybody
that's a normal thing it's just human
nature thank you so much for those of
you have been supporting me since day
one
you guys have changed my life I've said
that a hundred times before I don't
wanna get emotional in this video
because I will but whenever I have
