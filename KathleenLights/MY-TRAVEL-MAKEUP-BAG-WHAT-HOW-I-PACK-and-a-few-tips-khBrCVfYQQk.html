a what's in my travel makeup bag I
recently got inspired to do this video
since I am doing so much traveling in
April and on May so I thought oh my god
I haven't done one of those what's in my
travel bag videos in a long time that is
so like old school YouTube but you know
what I thought I'm gonna bring it back
and I thought this video would be
helpful for some of you just in case
you're about to travel somewhere I want
to share with you my travel essentials
these are the makeup products that I
usually travel with like everything in
this bag usually comes with me whenever
I'm saying somewhere like for about a
week cuz this is this is a big boy right
here if I'm going somewhere for just the
weekend I'll take a smaller bag but if
I'm traveling somewhere where I'm gonna
be going to a lot of events this is what
I take with me and I actually just got
this bag off of Sephora and I love it
like I love it so much I'm so happy I
got it it's from the Sephora collection
like the Sephora brand and it's called
the packet ball organizer it doesn't
even have any reviews I recently saw it
on the just arrived section and I picked
it up because I had been needing a bag
that looked like this I was using my
Laura Mercier one that kind of looked
like a binder I have an old video on my
channel it's like what's in my travel
makeup bag like old I was still living
in Mississippi and I was using that
Laura Mercier binder travel bag thing
and I loved it I was using it for years
but I kept finding myself needing a
handle that one doesn't have a handle
and I just I needed something with a
handle so when I saw since before I was
like that looks like it's perfect for me
so I picked it up and I freaking love it
it holds everything like literally
everything it is pretty big but I don't
find it to be too big like this would
fit in my suitcase perfectly I mean most
of the time I do travel with my makeup
in my hand which is why I needed a
handle so that I can wear like my
backpack on the plane and then just take
this in my hand I feel really confident
putting this in my luggage I have one of
those luggages that have like a giant
strap so everything is like nice and
tight and I feel totally confident and
comfortable putting this in my luggage
and I feel like it wouldn't break
because everything is like so tightly
packed in here anyway I freaking love
this I highly recommend it I don't know
if it
limited-edition I don't know if this
looks like something you would use I
would say go and pick it up because it's
really good and fabric is nice if it
feels nice and sturdy and also when it
comes to my other stuff like my
toiletries my toothbrush my shampoo my
moisturiser stuff like that I keep that
in a separate bag with like you know all
my bathroom essentials but on my makeup
stays nice and tight in here okay so
this is the back a little bit more up
close and it has a zipper it comes along
here so I kind of just packed my brushes
based on how I'm gonna use them on my
face so a foundation and concealer I
don't pack a brush for that because I do
take my Beauty Blender with me and I
find that to be super helpful because it
puts on my foundation my concealer even
my powder you could put on highlight
with it
the Beauty Blender is a travel essential
for me so I packed it in here and then I
take a brush like this to use for my
setting powder to set my concealer or to
powder the entire face I know it's a
little bit small to powder the whole
face you gotta sacrifice when you're
packing you know for bronzer I just take
a brush like this mainly because it's
small and easy to take but also because
it's the best bronzer brush ever you get
a really even application with this and
it's never messy and if I ever want a
contour all I have to do is like squeeze
this brush and I get a perfect contour
so this is an awesome travel brush it's
the heavenly luxe wand ball powder brush
from it cosmetics for blush I take a
brush like this this is the makeup
forever one to two brush it's just a
regular stippling brush I find needs to
be really useful for blush for powder
for anything even bronzer just in case I
always take that one I take my absolute
favorite highlighting brush of all-time
color pop small fluff brush and then I
take a few I brush 'iz these are my
essential eye brushes it kind of changes
every once in a while sometimes I'll
take this brush sometimes I won't but
for the most part I just need a crease
brush like a fluffy crease brush like
this I take a couple of those actually I
have this one and this one this is
actually what I love about having the
two elastics there's only four elastics
here like for eye brushes but because
they are so stretchy and because there
are two of them I like to put some
facing this way and some facing that way
that way I get a lot more storage room
and I feel like I fit so many more
brushes so I really love that but I take
a couple crease brushes a packing brush
for all over the lid a couple pencil
brushes
and then I definitely need to take this
with me this is the morphe b71 I use
this for everything I just love it I
have my Holy Grail royal and langnickel
eyebrow brush that unfortunately broke
in half literally it broke in half and I
can't seem to find it anywhere I need to
go back to Michaels but that's my
favorite eyebrow brush that's okay I
just have to use something else until I
buy it and then I have this little
angled brush just in case but those are
the brushes I take and that has this
little pouch right here which is perfect
for like flatter objects like lip liners
mascara eyebrow products you know all
that stuff and then it has these two
pouches that come right out and then you
get all this empty space so I'm gonna
walk you through all this stuff I'm not
gonna show you things in any specific
order but I am gonna go through these
two pouches first so I really like these
because they do come out of this bag
perfectly and super easy and I like that
these are very deep they're like deep
little pouches and I like that they're
see-through so you can see what's inside
and so I just keep like I said my Beauty
Blender in here well this is an equal
tools blending sponge but you know same
thing I keep my primers in here so I
purchased these tiny little primers and
these are so incredibly convenient this
is the Smashbox photo finish primer Iser
and the Beca first light priming filter
my two favorite primers like my all-time
favorite primers but they're in these
little travel sizes and I bought them
both on Sephora calm oh wait I think I
bought this one at Ulta I'm not sure but
I think you can still find these and
they're awesome for traveling so I bring
both of them I know it's excessive to
primers but I just love them both so
much I can't choose for foundation I
always travel with my makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation or my hourglass
vanish foundation stick just because
thick foundations are so easy to carry
with you you just white swipe it on your
face there's no glass bottle it's not a
mess these are honestly amazing these
and squeezy tubes best for traveling for
concealer I always take my Tarte shape
tape concealer it's my whole gray don't
leave home without it but I also like to
take my NARS soft matte complete
concealer just in case I don't want to
apply foundation a lot of the times when
I'm traveling I'll have days where I'm
like I'm not putting on foundation and
I'll just spot conceal so I really like
this one for that and it's also great
underneath the eyes as well you know
just as a backup concealer I do like to
take SPF with me just in case I never
know what I'm gonna do I don't know I
don't know how long I'm gonna be out in
the Sun so I've been trying this one out
recently I just purchased it it's for my
brand called volition never
than before but I bought it on Sephora
it's the prismatic luminizing shield and
I got it because it's SPF 50 which is
awesome so I like to use something like
this as a primer if I'm gonna be out or
whatever I keep my little agave lip balm
this is hands-down the best lip balm in
the entire world especially underneath
liquid lipsticks or anything drying
because it is really thick and tacky and
it's just perfect I love it I've been
obsessed with this Bobbi Brown Lux
eyeshadow in heat-ray for the past few
weeks so I've just been taking it with
me recently and I pretty much have my
back packed already because you guys
know I'm traveling a lot this month so I
threw this in here because I have a
feeling I will be using this a lot it's
just my favorite like everyday eyeshadow
I'm taking the NYX pigment primer just
in case I love this it makes your
eyeshadows last all day and you know
just in case I'm taking night I know
this may seem excessive but I have two
settings phrase here one is the essence
keep it perfect makeup fixing spray this
is perfect if you just want to melt all
the products into the skin and make your
face look really dewy and glowy but I
have to have to take this with me every
time I travel this is the Urban Decay
all nighter makeup setting spray
it's a long-lasting setting spray this
keeps my makeup on all day and this is
the travel version which they do so I
think it's Sephora or at Ulta I love it
and then I do like to take this specific
mascara with me when I travel I don't
know if this was a limited edition I
feel like I need like 80 backups this is
the Maybelline and Gigi Hadid fiber
mascara this makes my lashes look like
I'm wearing lash extensions or like
false lashes I used to take falsies with
me all the time every time I traveled
but I began to realize that I never used
them so I was packing them for no reason
I was packing glue for now it was just a
lot so I like to take a mascara that's
really gonna give me insane volume to
make up for not taking falsies so I have
been loving this for that whoa girl kind
of look you know everything and that is
everything in this little pouch fits a
lot of stuff I could still fit a bunch
more crap in here and then in this pouch
I have my other face stuff this is where
I keep all my compacts just so they all
stayed together and I know that they're
all in this little pouch for face powder
I'll usually travel with something
that's pressed just because I feel like
loose powders are a little bit of a
mission especially when you're traveling
they can get a little bit messy so I
like to take a pressed powder compact
and honestly it always changes but this
is the wet n wild
pressed powder in the shade warm light
it looks great in photos it sets my
under-eye concealer but yeah it also
sets the rest of my face and it's a very
smooth satin finish perfect for dry skin
it really does look great so I like
traveling with this one but I have to
take something a little bit more
luminizing just for my skin and I've
been loving the natural face glow from
girl lactic I kind of just put this on
my entire face just to give my skin a
little bit of a glow so I like to take
that a little excessive but I like to
take it and then I also take two
bronzers again maybe I just need one but
one is matte and one is shimmery and you
guys know I do like a glowy bronzer so
for my matte bronzer this is the Thrive
cosmetics Sunchaser blur and sculpt
bronzing powder in the shade Raya this
is like I think becoming my favorite
matte bronzer of all time I think don't
quote me just yet but it's perfect for
contouring and it's a very smooth powder
the formula is great and then if I do
want that
all-around glow usually I would take my
Too Faced Sweethearts bronzer you guys
know it's my favorite shimmery bronzer
but I'm scared to lose the cap when I'm
traveling so I take something like this
this is the hourglass ambient lighting
bronzer in the shade luminous bronze
light it is amazing it's perfect and
then for blush of course obviously I
have to take toasted cinnamon no matter
where I go Burt's Bees toasted cinnamon
it's my favorite blush of all time I
cannot leave home without it but I like
to take something like this and I
actually just purchased this off of the
Ulta website and this is so handy I love
this I feel like I'm talking a lot with
my hands I'm so sorry I'm CUBAN I'm
sorry so ignore that if you're someone
who travels very often and you like
blush you need this this is the make
every moment count cheek palette and you
get three blushes in here but I love
that you get this incredible mirror
which is awesome if you're traveling but
you get this like cool toned pink matte
blush then you get this nude blush and
then you get this like warm peachy
shimmery blush so two matte ones and a
shimmery one I love this guy
I feel like you don't need anything else
except this I just take Tosa cinnamon
because I have an attachment to it but
all you need is this when you travel you
have something for a cool tone look an
everyday look and a warm tone look and
you even get different textures in there
so that's awesome when it comes to
highlight I only take one thing with me
when I travel and
she's so sad to talk about this because
it was limited-edition I don't know what
they were thinking this is the NARS
about the sable highlighting palette it
is my favorite highlighter in the entire
world this one right here
no highlighter beats this guy in my
opinion because it can get really
blinding or it can be very subtle and it
always looks good it looks like it's
your skin it's not glittery it's not
chunky it's the best I do keep all my
you know flat little to be type of
products in this little pouch and I find
it super helpful again because it is
see-through and you can see exactly what
you have so I keep a lot of different
products in here
I take an eyebrow product of course this
one is the benefit precisely my eyebrow
pencil I either take this or my honest
hacia one I just I need to have one with
a spoolie at the end and this one has
one which is awesome I never know what I
need to pluck a sucker out so I have to
take my beans huh I don't what is this
my tweezers yes I for some reason I
couldn't think of the word in English
but tweezers in my opinion these are the
best tweezers I've ever used I think
they're way better than tweezer men and
they're from Revlon but it has to be
this one from Revlon it's the silver one
that kind of looks like a quilt I don't
like any of your other Revlon ones this
one is the best it doesn't pull my hair
like tweezerman of course I need an
eyebrow gel this one is one of my
favorites this is the colour-pop brow
ball still so those are my three
products for my eyebrows and then for my
eyes I do take two eyeliners a black one
and a brown one the brown one is my
Makeup Forever aqua XL extra
long-lasting waterproof eye pencil in
the shade and sixty it's just a deep
brown and I like to travel with this one
because it's super long wearing like it
lasts on my waterline forever so that's
fun essential for sure and then this is
the M cosmetics illustrative eyeliner
Mac's gel pencil in the shade black and
I find that this one also lasts a long
time and it's very creamy and easy to
apply oh my gosh that is one thing I
forgot to pack a sharpener I'm so glad I
found this video because I would have
left without interpreter and then I do
keep a liquid eyeliner i do prefer my
Inglot gel liner it's the one in the pot
but when it comes to traveling I prefer
traveling with a liquid eyeliner versus
a pot because it's easier to apply and
just easier on the go and I have to say
this is probably my favorite liquid
eyeliner that comes in this like type of
application this is the balm of showing
black liquid eyeliner I like this
because it's very very matte and
it's very very black so that's a good
one and then the rest of these products
are my lip products I do take a couple
moods like these this is my color pop
moonchild lip gloss it's the only lip
gloss that really take with me anywhere
these days because it goes over pretty
much everything and whenever I do use
lip gloss when I'm traveling it's
usually a nude I have to take my
Aquarius lippy stick because it's the
perfect everyday nude where you could
just throw on and not use a mirror so
it's awesome to travel with and then I
like this because this is very very long
wearing for like a nude lip color this
is the nude Stix lip and cheek crayon in
the shade whisper it's also more cool
toned than Aquarius so I find it to be
different enough and it also lasts a
long time on the lips
and then this is such a comfortable lip
color that I feel like I can wear it
throughout the entire day which is
perfect for travel this is the healthy
lip from Physicians Formula and this is
in the shade all natural nude one of my
favorite colors in this line it is
gorgeous and then I take three different
options I take a pink a bold color and
then a deep color right now of course on
living dreamy and cliff they're both
from colour-pop they're my recent
collabs this is perfect for an everyday
pink and this is a very bold loud color
which is perfect for just a minimal
makeup look just a little bit of mascara
something in your brows and this bold
lip is perfect for travel and then I
have been obsessed with this color this
is the nude Stix magnetic matte lip
color in the shade Joyce it's a
different formula from these whisper is
a creamy formula and this one is a matte
finish it is such a deep brown it is
gorgeous look at this that is beautiful
and lasts all day on the lips I love
this guy by the way if you want to see
the nude colors I like to take I'm just
gonna swatch all of them for you right
now I might as well this is whisper and
this is a quick Aquarius Aquarius
Aquarius is much more like shiny it has
kind of like a glossy creamy finish but
yes I need my nudes and then of course I
have to take lip liners these are
totally essentials these two are my
favorite nude lip liners ever this is
the Maybelline Gigi Hadid
tarah lip liner and this is Mac etc this
one is more cool tone and this one's
very very warm so I find them both to be
essentials and then of course I need a
red lip liner that's gonna last
throughout the day because if I do want
to wear a bold red like this I'll just
put this on my own
whip and go out the door I don't need a
lipstick to go over top of this because
this lasts forever I love this lip liner
it's the Makeup Forever aqua lip in 8c
and these are all the lip products I
take and brow products and eye liner
products and then I just lay that one
directly on top of this fits perfectly
and then underneath all of this is where
I keep my eye shadow palettes now this
part is gonna seem extremely excessive
because I take this dinosaur this is the
Natasha 228 eyes shadow palette and this
is the green brown one they have a
purple blue one but I like to travel
with this one because it's a lot more
wearable and honestly I know this sounds
crazy and it's very excessive but I like
this because it has a mirror even though
I think the mirror on this could be way
better especially for the price this is
over $200 it's so ridiculously stupid I
know that that seems like a little
aggressive but it is it's like a stupid
price like there's no other way to
describe it except stupid but I think
it's worth it I know that sounds crazy
but this is one of those splurge items a
really intense splurge item something
you want to save for only if you really
really want it because I find that these
are the best eyes shadow I've ever used
in terms of formula now I heard word on
the street is that Natasha's didn't
change her formula I don't know why she
would ever do that to me I don't know
but I heard she changed your formula and
that it's not as good I don't know
because I don't have the tropic palate I
just don't find the need for it so I
just haven't purchased it it doesn't
look like something I need right now but
I heard she changed her formula I hope
that's not the case but this is her old
formula her original formula these
palettes and it's pricey but I get a lot
of use out of it so it's justifiable for
me and I travel with it all the time
because of this mirror I just prop it
down like on a windowsill if I'm in a
hotel or wherever I'm at and I find that
it just sits up and it's big enough to
wear my entire face fits in this mirror
and I can do my full face of makeup when
I travel a mirror is 100% essential but
I'm always scared to break them so I
like this one because it's a super
sturdy palette I always travel with it
and the merit isn't bright I mean
alcohol would before that happens next
time but I find it to be super useful
plus you get a bunch of these Browns
oh my gosh it's just broke was that that
just happened right now this eye shadow
no no so I keep this on the bottom and
then of course I have to travel with my
dream street palette because
I use this color and Mooney on a daily
basis so I have to travel with it but I
have to mention these because these are
the best travel palettes in the entire
world these are the huda beauty
obsessions palettes she has four of them
but I like to travel with these two just
because I mean I have already so many
colors in this and in this but this is
the electric obsessions and this is the
smoky obsession so I like this one
because you get a mirror and you get
nine eyeshadows and look how tiny this
is this is like the size of my hand this
is insane
perfect traveling pilots you really did
kill it with this I like this one
because it has a black eyeshadow which
none of my other palettes have so I get
a matte black and plus you get all these
other shimmery glittery shades that are
a little bit more cool to them than the
ones in my Natasha's did one on one and
then I like to take this one it's not
really a necessity but just in case I
want to pop on my lower lash line I'm
feeling feisty I'm feeling crazy I like
to take the electric obsessions probably
because it's full of a bunch of colorful
eyeshadows and you just never know and
honestly if this palette was a lot
bigger I would be like I don't need that
I'm not gonna use that but because it's
so tiny
I don't mind taking it just fit so
probably this it's so tiny so perfectly
that goes on the bottom and then I
honestly just pop this right on top and
I have everything I need this is a
fullface and then some it fits so much
and actually I was off camera for like
an hour trying to find my Urban Decay
sharpener because it's my favorite
sharpener but I cannot find it anywhere
of course story of my frickin life so I
just found this to 401's I don't even
like it but I'm just going to take it
because I need to travel with a
sharpener oh my gosh
I missed this and I also forgot to pack
this business the cleansing spa water
from frozen dough gotta throw that
little sucker on the side as well and
then BOOM now I'm really good to go so
anyway guys that completes this video I
hope you enjoyed it I hope maybe you
learned something I don't know thank you

agave lip balm I what yeah okay this is
