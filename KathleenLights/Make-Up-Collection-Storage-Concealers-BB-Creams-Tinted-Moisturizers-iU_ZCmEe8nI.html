another one of my makeup collection
videos I not keep having the same intro
in all of these videos but just in case
I'm doing this little series where I'm
showing my makeup collection in sections
like foundations palettes powders I'm
breaking them down like that so I can
show you each individual product I have
and I can go into more detail with each
single product versus showing you my
entire makeup collection and just
skimming through things and in today's
video we are going to be tackling
concealers and tinted moisturizers I was
supposed to film this one last time but
somehow I ended up filming my powders 1
I'm basically just going through all the
drawers on my vanity you can't see them
in this angle but it's like right here
in this section and when I did my primer
video I told you guys I would show you
concealers and tinted moisturizers in
one video because I keep them all in the
same drawer so that is what we were
doing today I'm going to give you my
mini reviews and we're going to talk
about them so they may comment down
below what you want my next makeup
collection and storage video to be
focused on I want to do this portion of
my vanity next let me know if you want
to see that I keep my drugstore
highlights blushes and bronzers I'll
obviously break those down into sections
but anyway just let me know what you
want to see next in this series and I'll
do that but yeah if you want to see my
tinted moisturizers and my concealers
then keep watching
oh right keys and that's where I keep
all of my primers that I've already
shown you guys my primers I've kind of
accumulated some more primers since that
video I don't know how it happened but
it did
my whole setup is messy this is probably
my least favorite drawer I just can't
seem to find a way to store any of this
stuff leave me a recommendations down
below I know it asked you guys in my
primer video but I just I need more
recommendations help me I like to keep
things like this stand you up so that
everything is not just like sitting on
its side when it's bottles like this but
I don't know what to do I really don't
know and I keep these cheeky little
baskets in here I got this at the dollar
store and I got these at IKEA like in
the kitchen section I believe this is
where I keep my concealers and my tinted
moisturizers are back here here are my
drugstore concealers and here are my
high-end concealers by the way yes if
you see this I have holes in my pants
and I don't care I'm going to go ahead
and show you my tinted moisturizers
first the first one is the Laura Mercier
tinted moisturizer but this is the
illuminating one I like there
original tinted moisturizer but I do
like this one a little bit more because
there is a beautiful like glow and sheen
to it it's not super intense but when
you blend it in it gives your face like
the most beautiful soft luminous look I
love it I love it way more than their
original this is the kind of product
that's perfect for the summer if you
don't want a lot of coverage if you want
something that's really fresh or if you
just don't like foundation period and
you like very minimal coverage and you
have dry skin so you want something
illuminating and beautiful I think this
is a good one the LA girl Pro BB cream
is really really good I feel like it's
so underrated I have mine in the shade
light it's definitely one of the better
BB creams I've tried from the drugstore
it just looks so pretty on the skin it's
never patchy or weird and I find that to
be the case with a lot of drugstore BB
creams not all of them apply well and
they kind of look a little patchy this
one doesn't do that it's kind of
undetectable really it just sinks right
into the skin and it evens out the skin
tone it's definitely one of those
products that's good for a no makeup
makeup day I really like this one
especially for the price so this is a
brand new product to me and I would love
to know your opinion on this if you've
tried it before this is the dr. jart
ceramide in Dayton it says it has
natural coverage and UV protection it's
dermatologist tested and has SPF 15 like
I said I haven't tried this one out yet
but I did purchase it on Sephora I
wanted something that was even lighter
than a BB cream something that I can use
on the go really quick just put it on
and go out the door without any other
face makeup so I thought this would be a
really good one but I haven't tried it
so let me know what you think of this if
you have tried it these next two
definitely go hand-in-hand with each
other this is the it cosmetics your skin
but better CC cream I have the regular
version and the illumination version
they're exactly the same product except
this one has little tiny like flecks of
shimmer in it so when you blend it out
onto your face your skin appears a
little bit dewy
I personally even with my dry skin
prefer this one I mean I don't know I go
back and forth sometimes I mix them both
I have a shade fair and this one and
lighten this one because this is my
summer color and I just prefer the
illumination one in the summer I
absolutely love this product it has SPF
50 which is incredible and it has the
coverage of a foundation and not like a
sheer foundation or anything it has
really good medium to full coverage so
if you're someone who is looking for a
CC cream because of all the benefits in
a CC cream or a BB cream but you still
want that coverage of a foundation then
you definitely need to give this a try
its amazed
things it doesn't cling on to any of my
dry patches it lasts all day it just
looks beautiful this is definitely the
best CC cream I've ever tried sometimes
I don't want this much coverage so I'll
go to something else but it's really
really great this is the Maybelline
Dream bronze bb-8 and one beauty balm
this is a sun kissed glow Perfector it's
their bronzy version you can see here
it's obviously like a tan color compared
to my skin tone and I really really love
using this product in the summer I feel
like I haven't used it in so long but I
remember loving this in the summer when
I have a nice tan in the summer this
just blends onto the skin and it kind of
evens out Mike and it looks so beautiful
I also really love mixing this in with
foundations there are a little bit too
light for me in the summer this is
really really nice so I can't seem to
make my mind up about this product I
don't know if I love it I don't know if
I don't this is the Urban Decay Naked
skin one and done hybrid complexion
Perfector and has SPF 20 and it's
basically hasn't divorced razor I'm in
the shade medium light and even though I
like it I feel like I like other tinted
moisturizers more than this and I feel
like I haven't given it a fair shot so
I'm still trying to use it I'm still
trying to see if I like this I use
tinted moisturizer and BB creams on days
when I'm not filming I kind of skipped
foundations on those days and I go for
these kinds of products but I don't know
do you guys like this product I feel
like when it came out everybody was
talking about it there was so much hype
around this BB cream or to their
moisturizer but then the hype completely
died down and I haven't heard anybody
talk about it since so I would love to
know what you guys think about this
maybe you guys will influence me a
little bit into making my decision
whether I like this or not because I
don't know this is another really nice
one this is the dr. Dennis gross instant
radiance Sun defense it has SPF 40 and
it says it has sheer color correcting
technology I'm in the shade light/medium
and this one is a little bit strange
because for me personally I use this
more as an SPF like more than anything I
don't really go for this when I want a
tinted moisturizer I just go for this
when I want really light coverage with a
high SPF because sometimes I do want
more FPS than just 20 but I don't want
as much coverage as this gives me so I
went for something a little bit in the
middle it has SPF 40 and has very very
sheer coverage and I really love this
I'm using this when I'm out in the Sun
because I'm really protected it doesn't
feel greasy on the skin it feels really
lightweight and it's just easy to
reapply when you're not wearing
foundation I don't know I think this is
overall a really nice product especially
for the summertime the physician's
formula organic wear BB cream is awesome
I like this product a lot it has SPF 20
and I am in the shade light this one is
definitely a stick or BB cream I'm not
sure if you can tell this one is thicker
than I'm normally used to and this one
actually has really really great
coverage for a BB cream I love it it
covers up a lot of my redness I don't
feel like I need more coverage when I
use this and it just makes your face
look so healthy and radiant without
looking overly dewy or overly greasy I
really really like this one the color
selection totally sucks because
Physicians Formula sucks so bad
when it comes to putting out products
that will reach a wide variety of skin
tone they really do need to work on
their color selection but besides that
this is a really really great BB cream
with really good coverage I did a whole
video on this when I first bought it
this is the it cosmetics bye bye
foundation I saw an infomercial on this
product and it totally sucked me in and
I bought it but honestly it is the that
same product as their CC cream and it's
even more expensive
I really cannot tell the difference
between the two maybe there's a slight
difference this one smells a little bit
more citrusy and I don't know why this
one is pricier than this one when
honestly like all the claims on the back
everything about this product is just
like this one I really I don't get it I
still use it because I like it because I
like this but I will not repurchase it
because it's way more expensive than
this and I don't get it I don't get it
can somebody explain that to me okay so
those are all of my tinted moisturizers
now let's move on to concealers I'm
going to try to breathe through this
because I already feel like this video
is too long I'm going to go through my
drugstore one first the Wet n Wild
highlighting and concealing pens are
really really nice I love these I use
this one all the time this is ivory into
you and this is in the shade poising
nude I love using this mixed with really
dry concealers so if I have a concealer
that's just a little bit too cakey for
me I will mix this in with it I will
apply it right on top of the concealer
and blend it in and this just helps
blend out the concealer so nicely it's
also really nice on its own but it
doesn't have much coverage so I don't
really use
on its own maybe on like a no makeup
makeup day but for the most part I love
mixing this in with like Maxim sealers
it just makes it blend so nicely I love
the formula on this the Maybelline fit
me concealer is awesome if you have dry
skin they have a ton of different shades
which is awesome and it just blends
right into the skin it's a little bit
dewy so you're definitely going to want
to set it right away it does crease so
again you're going to want to set it but
if you have dry skin sometimes your
under eyes can get a little crusty and
this is just the concealer for you this
is the wet and wild a focused concealer
I just recently tried to sell for the
first time and I love it it has really
good coverage and it had like a satin
matte finish and I also found this
really really easy to blend into the
skin I was kind of shocked at how fast
it was blending in I really like this it
also lasted all day I know a lot of
people don't like this and I really
don't know why I think I think it's
really really good
one of my all-time favorite concealers
is the Catrice liquid camouflage high
coverage concealer I'm in the shade
light beige I love this so much it's
very very high coverage but it's really
liquidy it's not like sick and gross I
find it works really well on my dry skin
I have no issues with this and it's
waterproof it's just awesome all across
the board really amazing and it has a
really really great price point the only
thing that sucks about this is the scent
is a very very strong perfume scent but
it doesn't break me out and I look past
it because as soon as I'm done blending
it in the scent goes away the Rimmel
wake me up concealer is really good if
you have dry skin as well because it
looks really fresh underneath the eyes
and if you look really closely there's
like tiny very very very tiny little
shimmers in it but they don't really
translate on the face it just makes your
skin look nice and awake it's good stuff
it's not my favorite drugstore concealer
but I do think it's really nice and kind
of effortless and perfect for every day
I recently picked up the Neutrogena
hydro boost I got the shade light I
really wanted to try this because I
wanted a thick concealer that wasn't
drying most stick concealers are and
it's not that I actually do really like
it it doesn't emphasize any of my
texture or the lines underneath my eyes
or a stick concealer it's not too shabby
not too shabby I have to play around
with it a little bit more but I like it
for my dry skin I bet this is one of my
favorite concealers I use it all the
time off camera this is the Milani
retouch an erase like lifting concealer
I feel like it's exactly what the name
suggests every time I wear this
concealer
my under eyes look so lifted and light I
don't know if it's the color I got I got
the shade fair but my under eyes just
looks so glowy and not like Ana shimmery
we're in a doing way they just look
vibrant listed and awake I don't know
how to explain them but I really like it
I don't like the sponge applicator I
think it's weird it's just like is it
working for me but I still use it
because it's awesome and I think it's
really great and it has really nice
coverage as well the collection lasting
perfection concealer is a concealer I
got on Amazon because I don't think I
can get it in the States I got the shade
fair and I'm so happy I have this this
is such a great concealer and it's so
affordable
this has really intense full coverage it
is one of those concealers I really love
mixing with my wedding wild one because
this can get a little too drying for me
but I work with it because this lasts so
long and it stays looking flawless all
day the LA girl Pro conceal is one of
those concealers that I liked for a
while when it first came out and when
everybody was talking about it I had
like so much hype but I just don't
really use it anymore and not because it
sucks it's still a great amazing
concealer but the applicator it just
drives me bananas I have this brush file
applicator which I don't mind it's just
so hard to get product out of this tube
you have to squeeze the absolute crap
out of this and honestly like I don't
want to go through that trouble there's
so many other consumers that are so easy
to get to it's just kind of a hassle and
I know that's a stupid reason not to use
a concealer but when I'm going to rush
or when I'm just trying to get my makeup
done I never really grabbed for this
anymore and then the last drugstore
concealer is the number 7 radiant glow
concealer I love this it's my favorite
concealer to pick up when I want very
very minimal makeup like definitely that
no makeup makeup look because it doesn't
have a ton of coverage but it just makes
your under eyes look so smooth and it
kind of has like a soft satin finish
it's not too dewy but it's not too matte
it's like the perfect in-between I love
this guy I keep this one right here on
the side because I don't really like how
it looks just sitting in here is weird
this is a glossier stretch concealer and
I'm in the shade light I absolutely love
this I don't know if you can tell this
computer is so dewy but that's why I
completely love about it sometimes I use
this on my entire face I love using this
on one of those days where I just want
very minimal makeup and I want to look
fresh and dewy I'll just stamp this
underneath my eyes and on the rest of my
face just to give myself a little bit of
a glow and add a little bit of coverage
the other paw concealer I have is the
NARS soft matte complete concealer and
I'm in the shade vanilla this has
quickly become one of my favorite
concealer
of all times it gives your skin the most
beautiful soft matte look it has so much
coverage but it's not cakey at all it's
like a very thin consistency I don't
know how I did it I think I like it as
much as I love my radiant creamy which
is saying a lot because I love my
radiant creamy the tart shaped taste
concealer is my favorite concealer of
all time which is why I have so many
shades the color selection is weird they
just recently launched a bunch of new
colors because when they first came out
the color selection sucked but now it's
pretty good and honestly I can't really
find one that I love so I always mix a
couple most of the time I'll use fair
and light neutral and I'll mix these two
I have nothing bad to say about this not
only is it full coverage but it's not
drying underneath my eyes and yes it's
not the most dewy not the most hydrating
but it doesn't make my skin look cakey
or crepey or old underneath my eyes
doesn't cling on to the lines or
anything and the best part is that this
does not really crease I mean all
concealers eventually crease throughout
the date because you have creases
underneath your eyes but out of all my
concealers this one increases the lead
the NARS radiant creamy concealer is my
second favorite concealer of all time a
lot of people hate this and I can see
why because it is a pretty 6 concealer
so I can see why some people don't dive
with this but for me it just makes my
under eyes look so plump I don't know
how to explain it but every time I wear
this my under eyes look healthy if
that's even a thing sometimes as my
foundation is a little bit too matte I
don't want to go in with a super matte
concealer so I'll go for this and it
just makes my skin look even everything
looks perfect it's nice and radiant it's
very creamy and it covers up really well
I don't know how this made its way to
the high-end section but this is the
Physicians Formula insa ready full
coverage concealer and I have not used
this yet I purchase it I throw it in my
drawer and I completely forgot to use it
I've heard a lot of great things about
this though I hear people compare this
to the Mac Pro Longwear concealer which
is awesome I don't own it anymore
because just a hassle to use it comes in
the same packaging as that I hate
concealers with a little pump like this
I haven't even washed this before but it
was wait a minute this is going to work
okay the pump isn't as bad as a Mac Pro
Longwear one because that one just like
shoots product out oh okay why are you
shooting out like that oh my gosh look
at that okay I'm gonna have to save my
thoughts on this one for another video
because I don't know if I'm going to
love
humbleness cogent now recently sent me
there moisture fit concealer and I
thought I was going to completely fall
in love with this because there haven't
been a Kosh endo product that I don't
like they're an extremely pricey brand
but I have fallen in love with
everything they make
except this concealer okay so I've only
tried it once I'm wearing it today in
the video like in the intro and I like
it it covered up really well but for
some weird reason I feel like it
emphasized the texture underneath my
eyes like I saw like little dots of
concealer and that kind of happens to me
with really dry concealers which is
weird because this is the moisture of
thick concealer so I don't know why it
looked a little dry underneath my eyes I
have to test it out some more but face
our first impression I don't know how I
feel about this the Smashbox Studios
skin 24-hour waterproof concealer is
actually really nice I just recently
tried this out and I've only worn it
maybe like three or four times but I
really like it and has pretty good
coverage I think I have other concealers
in my collection that have more coverage
but I like it and it lasts all day like
when I blend this out into my skin it
stays on my skin for the entire day
which is nice but it's oil free and it's
very lightweight like it's a very
liquidy concealer so if you're someone
who hates a fix concealer you might
really like this the Too Faced Born This
Way concealer is a concealer I really
really liked until I discovered the
turqu shape tape so this is the one I
was like so loving until I got this
heart one but I do like this one and
give you a very fresh look to the skin
it's not as mad as a tart shape tape and
it's also not as full coverage so if you
are someone who doesn't like the shape
tape for those reasons you might really
like the Born This Way because it looks
very natural on the skin the Urban Decay
Naked skin weightless complete coverage
concealer is amazing it's definitely one
of those concealers to have a lot of
hype on YouTube but for a really good
reason it has great coverage the color
selection is really weird to have to mix
these two together I'm going to shade
fair and neutral and light warm but the
coverage on this is awesome I think it's
pretty comparable to those Tarte shape
tape this one can sometimes emphasize
the texture underneath my eyes if I'm
having like a really dry skin day but
most the time it does work for me it's
very liquidy and a little bit goes a
very long way it has kind of like I'm
not finished and it just looks flawless
on the skin it kind of makes your skin
look super airbrushed I love it the bare
Merrill's bare skin complete coverage
serum concealer was us with a concealer
that I was really into last summer it
just looks so dewy and beautiful but now
I guess I'm
so used to a more satin kind of
concealer or a more matte concealer that
this one sometimes can be a little too
dewy for me it's definitely the watery
as concealer I have not in terms of
coverage but it's very very illuminating
very wet you're definitely going to have
to set this concealer and set it right
away because it will crease immediately
and if you're someone that has a really
dry under eye you might want to check
this out because it's like your under
eyes drinking a tall glass of water the
mega primer Ultra HD concealer is
actually really really good I feel like
when this first came out everybody was
talking about and then people just kind
of forgot about it but it's nice and I
love their color selection they have a
bunch of different colors for a bunch of
different undertones I'm going to show
you why 23 this is actually really light
but I can make it work I just really
love their color selection especially
for those of you who struggle to find
the perfect concealer shade but yeah I
don't really use this that often even
though it is really good I just have
other concealers I prefer but it's
really good for what it is I mean it's
something best concealer I've ever used
but it's definitely one of the good ones
and then last but not least is the
econometrics bye-bye under-eye this is a
very very thick concealer I only
recommend this to those of you who have
like really severe dark circles because
this will cover them up like like it's
nobody's business this is so high
coverage and you have to use the
smallest amount because if you do not it
will look very cakey and it will look
too heavy it'll look gross I love people
don't like this concealer because I feel
like they might be using too much I like
blending my concealer with a Beauty
Blender prefer this one personally I
think it blends better with a brush you
get a better finish and I use this on
days where I really have like the worst
dark circles ever it gets the job done
okay so that's pretty much it I know for
someone who like has a Holy Grail
concealer maybe I shouldn't have this
many concealers but I like to keep them
around to use as reference or to talk
about in future videos but yeah
definitely nobody needs as many
concealers ocean is moisturizer or
anything else honestly pretty much it ok
guys so that completes this video I hope
you enjoyed my stop on some tinted
moisturizers and concealers that I own
and I hope you enjoyed this video thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe and haven't already and I will
see you in my next video bye and today's
video we are and I get this on this is a
bit of off bat because if you don't it
will look great pretty dr. jart
