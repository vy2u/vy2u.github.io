another makeup collection and storage
video as you guys know I'm doing these
collection videos in sections I'm not
showing you my entire makeup all at once
because that will be greatly so I am
splitting them up into groups that way I
can just give you more details on each
product that we can go through literally
everything and today's video is actually
going to be eight part two of my
eyeshadow palette collection I showed
you one drawer and today I'm going to
show you the other one I just couldn't
go into both drawers in one video
because if the video would be way too
long I know I have a billion eyeshadow
palettes I know it's just this is what I
do guys I think if I didn't have a
youtube channel I would probably keep
like five five five eyeshadow palettes
maybe six max ten go to more madamluna
oh and I'm wearing my glasses again in
this video I know the lights are super
annoying that's why I'm trying to like
position my face to where you can't see
the light in my glasses I was actually
wearing my glasses in part one so I
don't know I just put them on again
finally before we get into the video
how is my shirt alright alright
just do it with some blood and good ol
Lucille here I'm personally not a fan of
Ning and obviously not a fan and Lucille
but it's like the same way I feel about
scar from The Lion King like I hate him
because Mufasa is my favorite person
lion ever like I love Simba but I like
really really loves Mufasa more than
Simba but anyway it's like scar he's my
favorite Disney villain and he's
terrible but he's so good at being scar
that you like it that's the same way I
feel about negan he is the worse again
that's the same time you kind of like
him not like in a likable way like you
totally want Rick to kill him duh but we
all love to hate him you know I really
like Jeffrey Dean Morgan on top of that
anyway oh my have I've been sitting here
talking about The Walking Dead when this
is an eyeshadow palette collection video
I'm not sure where this shirt is fun
because I found Stephanie actually got
for me because she knows my walking dead
obsession and I just I start asking her
where she got it but she hasn't
responded so I was just telling in the
description box whenever I have clothes
on which is all the time in my videos I
always tell you where my clothes are
from actually hurt me so yeah I'm going
to stop talking now because it's getting
ridiculous and if you want
see part two of my eyeshadow palette
collection and just keep walking not
obviously men watching okay I was
thinking of the walking just keep
watching okay so here we are in park and
this is the other drawer where I have
the rest of my eyeshadow palette if you
didn't see part one I will link it down
below but basically I just got over this
drawer right here this is where I keep
my bigger palette my longer palettes
here's the top is where I keep my
smaller palettes that go keep a couple
claws in here I'll keep trios even
smaller compact palettes I keep them in
the top drawer most of my drugs for
palettes are in this drawer it's just
for some reason drugstore palettes tend
to be smaller so I get them in the truck
so I will go through each individual
eyeshadow palette I'll give you my stock
I'm not watching all of them just
because we would be here for a million
hours so yeah let's begin so this is the
Kat Von D Alchemist holographic palette
isn't a pretty new one it has four
eyeshadows in it and at first I was
totally not into this when I first saw
it I was like wow an entire palette just
for four little eyeshadows I couldn't
they make it a little bit more sleek
it's actually pretty small okay I don't
know if you could tell you have some
holographic shades and they look so
pretty when you blend them out like they
look really holographic I'm sure you
can't tell there but these layers so
nicely on top of other shadows like if
you have a matte black all over your lid
and you pop this on top of a black it
would look incredible next up we have
the makeup geek and many mu a palette
this is an eyeshadow palette that was
limited-edition made by Manny with make
it speak I love this palette it's
amazing I love the shades I love makeup
equality really really good stuff but
I'm pretty sure this is a magician and
I'm not sure if it's still available but
if it is it's really good I have the two
studio makeup palettes I got these in
box reach arms this is the warm up one
full of beautiful bronze colors I love
that there's a black I love that there's
a light shimmer shade and a light matte
shade I love that in a palette I can do
a full look with this and I don't need
to go to any other palettes so I love
that they included that they're really
creamy really buttery so pigmented
they're amazing and this one is their
cool down palette I don't like it as
much
the warm-up 1 just because I like warm
shades but the quality is still there
really good stuff I love this palette as
well they're a little bit pricey Studio
makeup is kind of pricey but I mean it's
really good quality - this is not
supposed to be in here I'm sorry this is
just my yeah I have the visor palette I
don't have all of them I have this one
which is my absolute favorite I have
used this non-stop I don't talk about it
that much on camera because it is a very
pricey palette this is like 80 bucks
which is insane I know but whenever I
need a matte palette a lot of the times
I go to this I just got it about two
months ago I was always one that was
like ah those lies our palettes are not
worth the money you can get other
eyeshadows for a better price and you
totally can but once I tried this I
completely fell in love
you have everything you could possibly
need in a matte neutral palette I love
it I also have this one which is brand
new to me I just purchased this one this
is their warm matte palette oh sorry
this one is called their neutral matte
palette and this is their warm matte I
haven't even used it yet I'm so excited
to use it it's full of warm shades like
it's my dream in a palette I have it in
the store which is why I haven't tried
it out yet so I'm going to keep it out
but I could play with it more and then I
also have this one which I've only used
a couple of times but it is gorgeous
this is their dark matte palette and
it's full of jewel tone matte shadows
which I love because it's a colourful
palette but there's deep colors so it
makes it so wearable so these are really
really expensive like that's expensive
but it's really really good stuff now
these I purchased because a lot of
people were telling me that they were
dupes for the bizarre palettes these are
the beauty treats modern matte palettes
I bought these on Amazon so incredibly
affordable I know why about this one
because these are not really colors that
I would normally wear except the oranges
but this one totally looks like it's up
my alley I have to be honest I've only
swatched these I haven't tried them on
my eyes yet and I don't want to give you
my opinion until I put them on my eyes
because things just perform differently
on the eyes but they slide pretty nicely
they're very pigmented they seem a
little bit chalky but like I said I
to try them out I have two physicians
formula quads this is their classic
nudes quad has four matte eyeshadows
these are incredible this one and this
one this one is their quartz quartet
this one is more cool tone I really
don't use that gray or that blue I use
the more brown shades in this palette it
is such good quality if you want matte
eyeshadows from the drugstore that are
really really creamy and you just want a
little quad something that's just going
to add a little bit of definition to the
eye nothing too crazy you need this quad
so pigmented so smooth and incredibly
easy to blend I love these this is the
sparkle baby palette from the brand
sugarpill I got this off of Beauty lish
I believe I know that seems like a
palette I wouldn't normally wear but I
really love sugarpill and I love the
pigmentation of their eyeshadows so I
bought this just in case and I want to
use this in the springtime this
eyeshadow right here is so beautiful
it's like a rose gold I definitely feel
like I'm going to dig into this palette
in the spring I have a couple of these
more fish palettes here is this a half
weeks yeah okay I only have two I have
the 12 and B palette if you like I
haven't given this palette a fair shot
I've used it a couple of times and every
time I use it I love it but I have to
play around with it a little bit more I
love how it's so compact and tiny I love
little palettes that have a lot of
eyeshadows in the palette and then I
have the 12s while the other palette has
both matte and shimmer this is just
strictly shimmer but it has a ton of
like incredible incredible shades like
one
I could understand that not everybody
liking it because it doesn't have any
mats in it this is definitely the kind
of palette that you're going to want to
pair with maybe like an all matte
palette and you'll get a really nice
look like that I have these palettes
that were sent to me all this one is
broken oh no oh no these are two pilots
from make up a Hillier Paris I'm sorry I
cannot say that word at ten years I'm
not French this is a high-end brand I've
only used this palette once and I
haven't used this one yet but they're
very creamy and they're very pigmented
does anybody know anything about this
brand they were sent to me but I didn't
really get much information when they
were sent to me let me know if you've
tried this I know they sell this brand
on Beauty lish let me know who try to in
it what you think about them because I
don't really know much about this brand
at all this is the eyes uncovered
palette by the brand collection this is
their nude bronzed palette this isn't
available in the United States but my
friend serene when she went over to the
UK she purchased this for me which is
really sweet of her this is a really
great eyeshadow palette it's drugstore
and it's really amazing quality if you
are in the UK and if you see this in
drugstore you totally need to pick this
up because it reminds me so much of the
Naked palette from Urban Decay very
pigmented very pigmented I have one
palette from Kylie cosmetics this is the
burgundy pollen I have the bronze one
but I didn't really like it I liked it
at first but I found it to be just a
little bit hard to blend and not as
pigmented as say like makeup geek or
anything like that and for the price I
just didn't feel like it was worth it so
I gave it to a friend of mine this one
on the other hand is actually really
really really good I really like the
quality of these eyeshadows they're
better than the bronze palette I don't
know why but to me it is like this color
right here is stunning look at that it
is beautiful I like the color selection
has nice warm shadows I don't know I
really really like this one I didn't buy
the peach palette because everybody was
saying that it wasn't that great so I
didn't want to buy that one
but the burgundy palette good stuff this
is my Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral matte
palette if you are not willing to spend
the money on the visor palette this one
is really really good I've used it for
years now the only shadow that I never
found to be painted
is the light shade like like what is
that like that I don't like the shade at
all but the other shadows in this
palette are amazing they blend so nicely
and they are so smooth and creamy look
at that so buttery I love it I got it at
Target you need this in your life
whether you like drugstore makeup or not
I think it's a staple it's really good
talk about these guys over here okay so
I have three pallets from ELF and these
three are the prism palettes and then I
have two of the mad format palettes and
he's the other knives are not on my desk
but I'm going to bring it just to show
you like I was saying these three are
the prism palettes I have the smoke the
sunset and the naked be naked is
definitely my favorite out of all of
them I love these palettes you get six
Ultra metallic eyeshadows they're really
really beautiful this one's my favorite
but I also have like I said sunset
full of like pinky ones I don't really
use this one that much but I do like
this shade right here and then I also
have the smoked one I don't think I've
ever used this I think I used the blue
once the green is really cool the blue
is really cool
I really like these palettes you do have
to work with them a little bit I like
using six plus with these to make them
ultra metallic but on their own they're
really nice as well this is the original
mad for max the first one that came out
and it's really good you get a ton of
neutral shape it's really awesome but
it's not nearly as good as the new one
this is the new met format it's the mess
I'm at - pellet and it's just full of a
ton of warm shades I like the color
selection in the second one more I don't
know they're both really good I guess
depending on your personal preference
maybe you like more neutral shades so
you like the first one more but in my
opinion I even think that the second one
this one is better quality I like it so
much to keep it on the disc that's
saying a lot
this is the radiant eyes eyes shadow
palette by Oprah and I can't believe I
haven't talked about this more because I
mean these shadows are unreal they're so
oh my gosh look at these okay these are
insane can you tell in the video I'm not
sure you can tell but these are so
metallic this is a highlight color even
on the face is stunning I really really
love this palette I want to use it more
often because it's so good and I feel
like I don't give it in
love let's talk about all my wet n wild
palette okay so I have these two right
here these are the bigger palettes I
have the comfort zone palette and
they're poster child palette this one's
not the best I have to be honest Lea
don't even know why I keep this I'm not
sure if it's you know I'm going to get
rid of it I don't love it the Blues are
not bad and this pink is okay that I
just I don't like it that much this one
on the other hand this palette is
amazing when Myles did something where
they change their formula of their
eyeshadows and they were no longer as
good as they were one hopefully that
changes and hopefully their palettes
become better because I feel like the
brand overall is just getting so much
better now but these classic palettes it
really really can't be beat and a lot of
the palettes that they've released after
this are not comparable and I don't know
why but anyway the comfort zone palette
is amazing I actually have a tutorial
using the green one that I uploaded a
couple years ago I love this shade right
here it's such a beautiful dual chrome
if you see this and you've never tried
it pick it up you won't regret it I feel
the same way about these this is the
walking on eggshells trio and this is
their silent treatment trio I use the
walking on eggshells trio in a bridal
makeup tutorial I did this is perfect
for a bride even if you're on a budget
or not I think that these shades look so
beautiful on your wedding day I don't
know I love them this one this is a
beautiful gem right here if any of you
guys recognize this from my channel then
you have been subscribed to me since the
beginning of time and I love you for
sticking around seriously I love you but
also a lot of you guys might recognize
this just from like ogee youtube days
this is the wet and wild vanity palette
and holy crap this is their best palette
and it is no longer available it hasn't
been available for years now what in
wild could just grab me one wish it
would be to bring this back I don't know
how they would but I would love them to
bring this back these three shadows
right here are incredible I don't know
this was the what a wild palette to have
it's amazing I have this buxom palette
that has a bunch of bottom shadows I
made this pilot myself they have all
their shadows individually and then they
sell this palette for you to just pop
these right in and I really like puck
from shadows I didn't think I was going
to love them as much as I do but they're
really easy to blend and I honestly do
love their color selection they have a
ton of different colors this is you
identity palette from the brand persona
Sona here on YouTube created her own
brand and I just wanna say
congratulations Sona that's amazing I
love this palette I love the color
selection and I love how creamy and
blendable these are I like that there is
a really deep chocolate shade I love the
color selection you get a bunch of
different colors you can do so many
different look and it's a really really
good good palette this is a palette that
I created on the NYX website I bought
this like MD NYX palette and then I
filled it with NYX eyeshadows except
this one this is a dark brown from
honestly I don't know why I had that
random eyeshadow in there but if you're
wondering the single eyeshadows from NYX
are so good I'm talking about these
specifically I forget the names of these
but they're like they're metallic cosmic
shadows and it comes across I measure
this shade and girl-talk is so good it's
so metallic and so reflective it just
looks incredible as a face highlight as
an inner corner highlight these are on
real I forget the names of these because
when you buy them individually like in
the pan they don't have the name on the
back which sucks definitely my favorite
NYX formula in terms of eyeshadows okay
I also have this guy from one and while
this is there I'm getting sunburned trio
and I haven't really used this one it's
one of their newer ones I think but I
keep you here because that Brown is
delicious and that gold is delicious I
have to move on E eyeshadow palettes
this one is earthy elements and this one
is bare necessities this one is a really
pretty neutral palette you get two maps
and then the rest or shimmers I actually
really like these I think the quality is
really nice like I really like this
highlight shade really stunning and I
love this chocolate brown I also like
this one and earthy elements because
this orange is delicious and I also
really love this color right next to it
as a crease shade funny enough the only
eye shadow I don't like in this palette
is this one it's nothing like the
highlight in the bare necessities one
this one is really chunky and glittery
and look at that nothing compared to the
swatch I gave you with this one I don't
think they're the best palettes at the
drugstore but they are very good I have
two from Becca cosmetics this is their
own brand nudes eyeshadow palette they
just recently sent this to me that's why
it looks like it's never been touched
but I have heard really really great
things about this palette this one on
the other hand
love this one this is their Umbra Rouge
eyeshadow palette which is very similar
but of course has more warm shades I
used to be obsessed with this at one
point it's like the only thing I was
using on my eyes I'm not even kidding I
love it they're very very creamy very
pigmented they're all matte and it's
just a nice palette to travel with I
used to travel with this all the time I
loved it that's why I broking but I
believe the other day I have this
palette from sleek it's there I divine
sunset palette really really beautiful
shades not my favorite palette but when
I use a little bit of fix+ it's like
unreal it's so good these two are
incredible look at that they're so
beautiful I just find that they don't
apply on the eyes as well as they swatch
with your fingers but like I said with a
little bit of fix plus you can get the
most beautiful warm cranberry eye with
this section right here
I get sleek off of the sleek website or
off of Amazon this is a palette that I
don't even know if I like this is the
eye art artist palette from the breath
Laura Mercier I don't know okay so I
bought this peak of my friend Laura
raves about this palette I've let me use
this twice so I know I should try it out
more to give it a fair shot but it's so
like average to me I don't know it in
and don't get me wrong it's beautiful
it's full of beautiful colors but I feel
like they're all a similar tone and
they're all pretty light and I don't
know there's nothing that I don't look
at this and think wow that's a palette I
want all over my eyes the Too Faced
peanut butter palette is so cute I'm
obsessed with it it's full of so many
beautiful shades
it smells like peanut butter well not
like super peanut buttery it has like a
mix of vanilla in there but it smells
really good I love this palette there is
not one color and here I don't
absolutely love those three are my
definite favorites I love it it's so
compact so easy to travel with and you
get such a beautiful warm look with this
palette I love bingo for these let me
show you I have a bunch of these like
two-faced little tin palettes this is
the natural eyes palette I love it
because it reminds me of when I first
started my youtube channel I used to use
this non-stop it was like the only
palette I was using I haven't get ready
with me where I'm using this palette I
love it it's so good I love this in my
crease I love this in my creases in the
outer corners all of these shimmer
shades look beautiful all over the lid I
like this is the best one
this one is another great one though if
you want only matte shadows because it
has a bunch of different undertones you
can use these for a warmer look these
for a more cool tone look and then these
in the middle for a more rosy look to
face those really great shadows
depending on what palette it is like
these and the little pins they're all
really great really good quality I don't
love their holiday pilots the ones that
are like huge to have a bunch of
different shades I don't find them to be
as good as these I think these are much
better quality that's just my opinion
and then this one is the boardwalk eyes
this one is beautiful for like a
romantic smoky eye
just one it's definitely more cool tones
but I like it I don't know I like the
toe penis to way I like how pairs with
the gray and the black it's really
really stunning this is the NYX ultimate
shadow palette and it's okay honestly
it's not my favorite palette on the drug
store I keep it because I really like
the shadow like the color selection and
there isn't anything you really can't
make work with a little bit of fix blow
so I keep it for that reason maybe I
could use it in a drugstore video one
day I know a lot of people who swear by
this so there are so many people that
love this palette but for me the
shimmers were kind of lacking I like the
maps a lot but the shimmers were like
not my personal absolute favorite but
definitely I still think it's worth
checking out this palette is one of my
favorite palettes from Tarte this is the
energy noir palette if anybody's
wondering where my manager palette would
be because it would definitely be in
this drawer since it's smaller I have it
on my desk right now since its brand new
and I'm using it a lot these days but
anyway this is like I said the energy
new la palette and I'm obsessed with
this you wouldn't think I would be
because I don't really go for colors
like this but everything just pairs so
nicely that I love it this blush is
incredible I love it I love their
Amazonian clay blushes and this color is
stunning I love it I love the color
selection I love that you get a matte
dark chocolate color a matte black and
even a matte dark plum and then you get
these really pretty taupe we shades a
light shade for underneath the brow bone
or a light shimmery shade I've used this
as my face highlight before it's really
pretty and it's just really good I don't
know if this is still available I hope
it is because it's so beautiful I really
hope it's still available this is the
Kat Von D shade + light eye contour quad
she came out with a ton of different
ones but this one is my favorite and
this is the one that I kept I gave the
other ones to friends and family because
they really seem to like them this one I
kept because it's so unique I feel like
I really don't have anything like this I
mean of course I have purple eyeshadows
in my collection but I love the
combination I love this like light pink
shade right here
they're so pigmented I mean you know
kept on these mats are incredibly
pigmented this one is really nice too so
I bought this because I did a huge
luxury video where I reviewed really
really really luxury high-end makeup
this is the Tom Ford eye color quad and
nude dip ridiculously expensive and in
my opinion it's not really worth your
money I keep it because I spent so much
on it and I do like this shade right
here but honestly a way - it's a lot of
money for for eyeshadows that's crazy
visiting the Charlotte Tilbury the Dolce
Vita luxury palette I just recently
purchased this because I saw a youtuber
using it in a video and I thought it was
so beautiful that I went on the
Charlotte Tilbury website and I bought
it so I haven't used it yet but I think
it's so cool how she has like this
foiled shadow right here and the wrists
are more toned down I like the color
selections it seems like something I
would really like so I'm excited to try
this and then last but not least is this
guy I don't even like this palette all
that much anymore I've had it for years
the reason I keep this is because I
think this is the first palette I ever
reviewed on my channel this or The Naked
palette I'm not sure this has so many
memories tied to it for me I remember I
had just started my channel and I really
wanted to review it it was brand new oh
by the way this is the Sigma creme de
Couture macaron inspired eyeshadows it's
full of a bunch of colorful pastel
shades and when I first saw this on the
internet I hadn't really seen anything
like it I had just started out into
makeup and I was like floored at the
color selection I was like oh my gosh
that is incredible I had to get my hands
on it and it was just fun I like to hang
on to things like this that really
remind me about my channel and how I
first started and just I know it's nice
to have these things but I loved it when
I had it and yeah they told me don't
make this any
or but I keep it for memories hey guys
