wanted to get this intro out really
quickly I went to edit this video and I
realized I didn't have an intro so I
decided to just sit down really quickly
and just tell you guys what you're about
to watch even though you know by the
title obviously I wasn't planning on
filming today clearly but today's video
is going to be my eyeshadow palette
collection now unfortunately if I were
going to show you every single palette I
owned the video would be way too long
time going to break this video up into
two parts this part one because I have
two drawers full of eyeshadow palettes
and then I have kind of like a shelf
full of my really large palettes so
today we're going to be tackling my
really big palettes and then one of my
eyeshadow palette drawers if that makes
any sense but most of my drugs for
pallets are sourced in the smaller
pallet drawer because most drugstore
pellets are not very big so you will
definitely be seeing more drugstore
palettes in part 2 so definitely know at
the end of this video if it's something
you even want to see also I completely
forgot to mention my coloured raine
queen-of-hearts palette in this video
because I had it here on my vanity so I
realize I just didn't talk about it at
all but know that I do have it I haven't
even used it yet because I just bought
it but I'm pretty sure it's already sold
out so that sucks but anyway I want to
come into that really quickly just in
case you see matte palette and you're
like hey laughs into the Queen
personality that you bought we're just
playing with a dog toy to drive me nuts
but anyway if you want to see my
eyeshadow palette collection at least
some of it then just keep watching okay
so I keep most of my makeup and these
Alex drawers right here I actually have
another one right next to it these are
the Alex drawers from Ikea these have
the six drawers they have another one
that's much taller that has nine drawers
I believe and I keep both of them
side-by-side just sitting on the floor
they're a little bit short so it kind of
it I don't know it doesn't really work
I'm still trying to figure out the best
possible way to store my makeup because
if I'm going to be completely honest
with you I'm kind of over these drawers
but at the same time they just store
makeup so well I'm kind of torn I don't
know what to do but anyways in the
meantime this is where I keep most of my
makeup I'm getting coffee so I keep my
eyeshadow palettes and these two drawers
right here this one
I know I have like a ridiculous amount
of pallets and this one if you're
wondering in these other drawers in the
first one I keep these Natasha's Venona
five eye shadow palettes but I'm not
going to go to the leaves because I
think I want to do a video dedicated to
these likes watches and stuff let me
know then I keep my pigment here I keep
all of my single eyeshadows these two
are the palace and then here I keep all
of my falsies and at the bottom is my
backup door which I don't even want to
open it's like really bad okay so let's
do the bottom eyeshadow drawer first
this is where I keep all of my larger
eyeshadow palettes I keep my smaller
eyeshadow palettes like this in this
drawer when my larger ones are here I
have the bomb meet matrimony palette
it's just an eyeshadow palette that has
a ton of matte shades it goes with so
many different eye looks it is so useful
you have a very light matte cream color
for your brow bone you have a black
transition shade cooler shade purple red
it has everything really great palette
the balm has awesome quality eyeshadows
this is the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette I have used this so much
it's like kind of ugly
all of these eyeshadows are matte you
have this shade right here that's like a
really pretty shimmer shade and it pairs
it so nicely with all of the matte
colors and the best part is that these
are not just for that Matt she's not
your typical matte shadows they kind of
have a satin finish and it makes it
really flattering on the eyelids because
they're not chalky or pottery they're so
creamy and so easy to blend I feel like
this palette is really really underrated
I have these four is the way of a
palette this one is their taupe palette
I'm not sure if it was limited edition
or not but it's full of taupe and pinky
purple grey shades I don't typically
wear shadows like this but that is why I
keep this palette on hand because even
though I don't really use it that much
whenever I want to do a cool toned look
and include some Grey's and Silver's I
go to this palette my favorite zoeva
eyeshadow palette is actually this one
this is the cocoa blend palette you've
seen me use this a few times on my
channel
fun fact this shade called pure ganache
is what inspired me to add the gold in
my morphe palette my morphe palette
collab is actually sitting on my vanity
I have it like on my desk I don't have
it in this drawer because I use it so
much that I just keep it on my vanity I
love this palette has everything I need
has like chocolate shades light shades
it's just all around a really great
palette I love the color selection this
one is called caramel melange and I love
it as well this one is actually newer to
my collection I haven't really used it
on my eyes but this color right here
called liquid Center oh my gosh look at
that look at that it's incredible and
this one's called Blanc fusion I haven't
used this one yet either it's pretty new
but I like it because all of these at
the bottom are mess and they're matte
shades that you could use every day all
the way shadows are amazing across the
board I have the violet Boss Pro
eyeshadow palette the updaters are
packaging now it has like this almost
holographic grain bold look to it this
is a great great eyeshadow it has all
the colors you could possibly need for a
very very warm smoky eye those are just
colors that I personally love to wear I
also have the Laura Lee palette but
actually lent that one to my mom so I
have a sense right now
the Laura Lee palette is actually
amazing as well Kat Von D shade in my
eye shadow palette another classic I
feel I feel like when this palette first
came out I got a lot of hype on YouTube
and it's really really good it has a ton
of different shades like this is the
only matte eyeshadow palette you could
ever need but the only issue I have with
this palette is that they are too
pigmented almost I know that sounds
crazy but they are so so so pigmented
that you have to spend a lot of time
blending them they do have a lot of kick
ups but it's still an amazing eyeshadow
palette I just wouldn't recommend this
for a beginner someone just starting out
with makeup might not love this palette
this is actually a palette I created
myself on the sugarpill website I went
on their website and I bought this sugar
pill Pro palette and then I just created
this palette we have a ton of different
shades for you to choose from I just pop
them right into this palette sugarpill
has amazing quality eyeshadows there's
another palette that's a little bit
newer to me I just recently got this
this is the urban decay after dark
eyeshadow palette it's one of those
palettes that you cannot create a full
look just using this palette it's
definitely one of those that you have to
mix in with something else they're all
jewel toned very very beautiful shadows
the same kind of goes for the Urban
Decay electric palette now this one is
one of my favorite palettes in the
entire world I'm obsessed with the
packaging of this palette it's so
beautiful and I just
of the colors this palette just takes me
back to when I first started my youtube
channel I remember I got so excited when
I bought this and I used it so much but
like I said it's just one of those
palettes that you can go to if you need
a pop of color and the same kind of goes
for the moondust palette also my Urban
Decay if you are familiar with their
moon does single shadows they pretty
much put a bunch of them in one palette
I love them they're just like glitter
top coats they applied best with either
six plus a mixing medium or a glitter
glue because they're really just like
glittery top coats I don't know they're
so so beautiful though I love this
palette I don't need to say anything
about the Anastasio Modern Renaissance
calendar because I've spoken about it
literally a million times I've used this
non-stop - super dirty I'm obsessed with
this palette it was in May 2016
favorites and then here I have the basic
palettes I have the original Naked
palette which is my favorite it's full
of beautiful warm shade this was
actually a brand new one because I
completely destroyed my original one
this one is being naked - I had
decluttered mine originally but then
they sent it to me again with this
really cool design on it so I wanted to
keep it because I thought it looked
really cool but if I'm going to be
completely honest out of all the naked
palettes this is the one I like the
least and then of course the Naked 3
this also reminds me of when I first
turned in my channel this one is full of
really beautiful rosy tones I did use
this a ton when I first got it and I
still like it whenever I want a really
romantic pink eye my mind immediately
goes to this palette so I keep it on
hand because I use it every once in a
while I really like it ok so back here I
keep all of my Natasha's anona eyeshadow
palettes
these are the best I shadow as I've ever
used in my entire life in my entire life
and I'm just going to say it Natasha's
gonna make the best eye shadows in my
personal opinion now with that being
said they are ridiculously priced they
are extremely extremely extremely pricey
I don't really remember the name of this
one it doesn't really say it on the
packaging I don't love Natasha's
anonymous packaging if I'm going to be
honest but I can't take away how good
the quality of these eyeshadows are I
mean they're amazing this one is the
star palette has like stars all over it
my lighting is like kind of washing
these palettes out doesn't actually says
the name it's one of her newer eyeshadow
and this is what it looks like I just
hate this little insert I don't know I
prefer the names to be on the packaging
but anyway like I said if the quality of
this is unreal like look at that oh my
gosh let me just show you this like look
at that like look at that that was a
terrible swatch well the only eyeshadow
that bugs me in this palette is this one
because it's just pure glitter and I
find that it just gets everywhere but
besides that really amazing quality and
these I have to say are the best of the
best these palettes right here you get
the I think this one is the blue palette
or the blue purple power and then the
other one is like the brown green
palette I don't know I could be making
that up
I've never seen an eyeshadow palette
with this high of a price tag if you're
willing to splurge or put this on your
Christmas list or on your birthday list
I do personally think it's worth it
because I mean like I said these
eyeshadows are unreal I've never ever
ever felt anything like this in my
entire life amazing and then this one is
the other one I was talking about this
one is my favorite I like it more than
the other one it's just this one has
more wearable colors beautiful really
rich eyeshadows incredible formula I
mean like really have you seen anything
so crazy before like I said it
definitely has a luxury price tag and
there are a ton of other eyeshadows on
the market that you can get that are
really amazing quality but I can't lie
and pretend this sucks because it's
amazing I have the Too Faced chocolate
bon bons palette right here and then a
two-faced sweet peaked panelist this
chocolate bomb Mogollon is really really
nice but if I'm going to be honest I
don't really I don't you know what I'm
going to give this away cuz I'm not
declutter but I don't really touch it I
use it at first a lot but I always
always always reach for my chocolate bar
palette which is not in this video
because it's sitting on my vanity along
with my morphe palette because those are
the two palettes I use non-stop the
original chocolate bar is just so much
better than this in my opinion so you
know what I'm going to give this to my
mom this sweet peach palette that's a
different story
this one is amazing I love it because it
just has all the warm shades you guys
know I love it smells like runs candy
and I just I really like it the Tyler
and bloom is one of my favorite palettes
of all time I use it so much this year
but this bronze
is beautiful I love the color selection
because it's a natural palette but you
can still get a really smoky look
because of these darker shades I don't
like the original tartlet palette I
think the quality isn't as good as this
one
this one I really like Joseph's colors
came out with a palette called hidden
treasures and it is unreal I feel like
it's so underrated is this even
available anymore I'm not sure I hope it
wasn't limited edition because it's so
cool I don't like the layout of this
palette because all these eyeshadows
look scattered and weird and I feel like
they could have added more shades into
this palette if they would have just put
them like this like you could have
gotten double the eyeshadows I get it
it's cool it's different it's not the
typical palette and they wanted to do
something unique it just takes up space
for me I don't know but really good
quality very very pigmented this is the
lorac Pro palette I keep this just in
case I want to do like a throwback
tutorial or something like that because
this used to be so raved about and I
feel like it's kind of lost in the dust
there's so many other palettes out there
on the market that I just really don't
use this that much anymore
at all actually in Matthew I I rather
use my Too Faced chocolate bar palette
but it was so really good when I first
came out and I love how sleek it is and
compact this is my favorite lorac
palette though this is the unzipped
palette
I love the rosy tones in this palette I
feel like it's so underrated no one
talks about this palette but it's so so
good you have all these beautiful rosy
romantic shades and I really really like
the quality the master palette by Mario
this was limited edition from Anastacio
and at first when I got this time I was
like you know what this is going to be
like too basic to boring I have so many
shadows that look like this but it's
actually really really nice quality and
the colors just blend so nicely together
each color works so well with all of the
colors in here like you can get a
beautiful look with these shadows this
is a palette by ciate london and it's
their collab with Chloe Morello it's
their pretty fun and fearless palette I
haven't used this palette enough I've
only used it once but the one time I use
it I loved it I think the shadows are so
good the mass blends so nicely into each
other I really really like it shine
bright is a really beautiful gold and I
really like Chloe Morello a lot this
next one is the urban decay naked
ultimate basics palette it's full of a
ton of matte shades pretty much all the
ones you're ever going to need
transition shades running from warm to
cool and I like to
using I love how it has a really large
mirror so I keep it for that I don't use
it as much as I use my other matte
palettes but I really like it these two
palettes are from makeup revolution I
got these on the Ulta website these are
very very very inexpensive this one is
just full of a ton of shimmers and then
this one is just full of matte I haven't
really used these that much yet I just
recently got them and haven't really put
them to the test
they seem really really good-quality I
really like makeup revolution they do a
lot of high-end makeup for an affordable
price this is the BH Cosmetics Carli
bybel palette this probably was
limited-edition and I think it's finally
leaving I'm not sure if it's still
available and ultra or not but I'm so
sad because this palette is so good
especially for the price you get a ton
of eyeshadows and face highlights as
well that you can use as eyeshadows it's
such a good quality palette and the
price is right
really good congrats Carly I love this
I'm weird it I guess my mom gave him
Pema no I gave my mom the new one they
just updated their packaging and I gave
my mom that new one anyway this is Laura
Lee pally with violet vos full of really
beautiful colors I love that you get so
many colors in one palette and it's so
sleek and compact but it's tough and
then these two are from Julia's place
this one is the original Nubian palette
it's full of really beautiful warmachine
actually having used this palette all
that much I don't know why because it's
full of colors I love this actually
would be considered a small pilot and
should have it up there but I keep it
with the other one really good stuff and
then this one is being Nubian - really
really beautiful shades this brand is so
beautiful you get a ton of really
amazing high quality eyeshadows and it's
so affordable I also have the masquerade
palette which is probably my favorite
one out of all of them but I keep it
separate I keep it with my really large
palette so I'm going to show you in a
second
so because I'm going to show you the
rest of my larger polish I know going
through this drawer is just going to be
it's going to be way too much so let me
know if you want to see a part to to my
eyeshadow collection I'll probably talk
about it a little bit more in the intro
but please let me know in the comments
below okay excuse the really crappy
lighting in this area so I'm in a
different part of my room and here on
the floor is where I keep all of my
large palettes these shelves are
actually like these children here
they're floating shelves from the
Container Store I don't recommend them
unless you're putting something that
doesn't weigh a lot on them because they
will start to bend and lean forward kind
of like this one in right now and you
can see it's supposed to be like this
but it's is this I have a situation
going on in my Beauty room which is why
I haven't done a Beauty room tour
they're still wrapped in their packaging
but for right now they're just sitting
here until I return them and I have my
palettes just sitting on top of a show
super professional this is not very
organized but anyway I wanted to show
you my other palettes because I do have
a bunch over here and this is an
eyeshadow palette collection so I'm not
gonna talk about these because these are
all the palettes
they're full of a ton of different
eyeshadows like I have so many so I'm
not going to go through each and every
one on but all of these are three powers
this one is full of makeup forever
eyeshadows again they make up forever
ten but then the rest of these are
palette they're just so big that it's
hard to store in my Alex drawer well
these are actually not so big these are
two from morphe these just recently
released but I think they're out of
stock I'm not exactly sure I haven't
even played around with these yet so
this palette is actually from jcat bTW
if they're Sunset Boulevard 24 hours
autopilot I bought this on the Ulta
website this is what the palette looks
like reminds me a lot of the morphe
shadows and they're really really good I
forgot how much I paid for this on Ulta
but like look at it like so creamy so
good and like I said the pilot was super
affordable I haven't tried any of the
maps
I've only swatch them a bit and they
feel really nice like they feel like
good quality I have to play around with
this eyeshadow palette a little bit more
this is the masquerade palette by
dubious place I am so mad at myself that
I didn't include this in my yearly
favorites video because this is decimal
one of my favorite palettes from 2016 I
needed it so much which is weird because
it has so many crazy colors but this
section right here I used it non-stop
it's an amazing amazing eyeshadow
palette for a really great price this is
the Kat Von D neva loca palette it's a
stunning I shot a pilot with a ton a ton
of colorful shadows it's mostly matte
but it does have a few shimmers thrown
in there I love this palette so much
because you get like a color wheel of
every single color you will possibly
need in your entire life plus this
little wheel on the inside is such a
wearable color selection but don't
understand why this is limited edition
please can't let me bring this back it
is so good this is also easy pellet but
it has makeup speak brushes and then
he's back here are all of my morphe
palette this is the 35k it's a really
stunning palette that has a ton of
neutral shadows really amazing for
everyday because you get a few like
shimmers to them in there really good
stuff this one is the 35 T palette which
is another favorite of mine I love the
3500 a little bit more a little bit more
but there was a point where I was using
this non-stop I have a tutorial using
this palette such a beautiful mauls
purpley tone palette this one is be 35
om and I actually have never even
touched this palette I think I swatch
like two eyeshadows but I haven't used
it yet because if I'm going to be
completely honest I've used the 35 oh
the most I just use my 3500 way more
than this because this is all matte and
then be 35 OS is all shimmer but the
3500 has both mattes and shimmer and
don't get me wrong this is way more
versatile like you can get this one and
the 35 OS and you'd be set but
personally for me since I got the 3500
first I don't really reach for this just
like this one this is the 35 OS and I've
only used like four shades in this
palette which I mean it's fine don't get
me wrong it's completely shimmer so it's
not like you're going to do an entire
look just with this but it's nice to
have on hand you know a palette full of
shimmers but this guy is my baby I love
this palette I use it so much this is
the 35 oh is it awesome because you get
a ton of math and a majority of this is
matte but then you get those at pops of
shimmers throughout the palette really
really amazing if you love a warm
polity regular 3500 is what I recommend
over the 35 LM and the 35 OS and then
the last morphe palette I have is the 35
F palette this one is really cool
because you just get this tiny little
row of maps and the rest are shimmers
but the maps are awesome because they're
really nice transition shades and then
you get like your deeper shades this is
a black I don't use this palette that
much I've only used it twice but it is
really good quality like look at this
eye shadows is so intense can you
believe that look at that one little
freaking swipe the last palette I have
back here is the metal matte palette by
Kat book by Kat Von D this is what it
looks like on the inside I also haven't
really used this palette isn't a
beautiful face highlight by the way oh
my gosh like it looks so nice
no mats are really nice and I like the
fact that it's mostly met when you do
get your tops of shimmer in there it's
just very big like it's a very large
bulky palette but it's nice
it is a mission to open
I'm yes I'm sorry I'm sorry go there I
can't I can't
that's dirty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
