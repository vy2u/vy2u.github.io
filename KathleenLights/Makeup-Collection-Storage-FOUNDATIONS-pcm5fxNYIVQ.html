my foundation collection I know I said I
would be filming a makeup collection
video which I kind of am I'm just
breaking them up into several videos and
the reason is because when I posted a
video the other day asking you guys to
leave a ton of comments with requests
like what videos you would want to see
for me I noticed that so many of you
told me not to do a full blown makeup
collection but to split it up into
sections and show you a collection kind
of like in each category because if I
sat here and just took you around to all
my makeup I wouldn't show you every
single thing I would kind of give you a
general view which I know some of you
really wanted and some of you didn't so
I'm kind of confused definitely leave me
a comment down below if you like this
style or if you just want one specific
video if more of you want just an
overall general view I'll do that but if
you like this style let me know I have
done videos like this in the past
already but I feel like I haven't done
one recently and we need an update so
I'm splitting up my makeup collection in
two sections
today is just foundations because I have
a million of those but next time I'll do
like tinted moisturizers and concealers
and then primers and powders or whatever
just so you can see everything
individually but I am still taking you
through my storage last time I did a
makeup stash video where I showed you my
entire highlighter collection my entire
bronzer collection last time I did that
I was just kind of like sitting here and
showing you this time I'm going to take
you through my actual storage if that
makes any sense I think the next one I'm
going to do is tinted moisturizers and
primers because that's the second drawer
down you'll see the drawer in a minute
I'll show you but yeah that's basically
what this video is going to be I'm going
to show you my foundation collection and
how I store my foundations on my vanity
or in my vanity and this isn't gonna be
a declutter video I know that was super
requested I kind of had a little
mini-series on my snapchat where I
decluttered a ton of stuff I let me
explain something really quickly really
fast I get so much makeup not only do I
get sent a lot of makeup from companies
I'm constantly buying a lot of makeup
just because I don't want to only show
things I get sent for free I want to
make sure I am purchasing things all the
time which I know sounds crazy it kind
of sounds like I have a shopping
addiction but it's for my channel it's
from a job that's what a temple so
because of that I have so much makeup
and I got to a point where I'm just
constantly decluttering not like all at
once
constantly giving things away and don't
get me wrong you're gonna look at these
foundations and be like wow I know I do
I have a lot of foundations I have a lot
of makeup but comes with the territory I
keep things on hand to review to compare
to other formulas sometimes I hold on to
something I don't really use just for
reference you understand I don't have to
say here make a disclaimer and also I
wanted to mention that when I'm done
with my makeup collection when I show
you everything I'm gonna do a room tour
I'm gonna take your on the entire room
show you where I got stuff and you know
all that stuff so yeah I think that's
all I wanted to say without further ado
if you want to see all the foundations I
own we'll just keep watching okay guys
so this is my vanity this is where you
see me filming in front of whatever I do
more chatty videos a lot of you guys
know this already but some of you don't
Danny actually built this desk for me
but this is where I keep all my
foundations in the top drawer right
there and if you are wondering why this
drawer is whiter than these two that's
because it is funny sorry when Danny
went to build this desk he had gotten
all the materials this is Formica and he
thought he had enough to complete the
entire desk but then he realized he was
missing one section and when he went
back to Home Depot to get more Formica
in this color they were sold out they
only had this extremely white shade so
that's why got a lot of DIY I actually
loved that about my desk I think it's
funny
anyway I got these knobs from
Anthropologie so I keep all of my
foundations in this top drawer right
here this is an acrylic organizer to put
all of your foundations is from the
brand sunny cosmetics I love this thing
I bought it a couple of months ago I
will link the website down below even
though I think it's currently sold out
and it fits perfectly in the Alex stores
that are made by IKEA if you have those
I love this because my favorite way to
store foundations is standing up and
every time I tried to open this drawer
foundations will just fall everywhere so
the only thing I don't love about this
setup it doesn't pull out far enough so
I kind of have to reach the back to grab
my stuff but that's not a big deal in
the back row I have my makeup over face
and body foundations the first two are
actually the original formula of the
face
somebody I must refer the original
formula this is my favorite foundation
of all time still haven't found a
foundation that compares to this the
face and body foundation from Mac breaks
me out terribly I have no sensitivity to
this one it just looks so beautiful it
is a light coverage but you could
definitely build it up and never ever
ever gets cakey even when my skin is the
driest this foundation is amazing every
time I go out at night where I know I'm
going to be taking photos this is the
foundation I wear it also lasts the
longest on me out of all my foundations
it never looks bad if you're someone who
suffers from a lot of breakouts you
might want to use concealer with this
because it is a little bit sheer but the
finish is beautiful I am in the shade 20
normally which is this one and then when
I'm really self tan I'm in the shade 32
and then on the same row back there I
have these three foundations it's still
the same foundation only now it's called
the water blend foundation I like it a
lot but I don't love it as much as I
like the face and body
totes disappointed they changed the
formula I have two healthy mix serum
from Bourjois this is such an amazing
foundation it used to be like my holy
grill I used it all the time I'm usually
in this shade which is 52 vanilla but
sometimes when I'm a little bit tanner I
will use this one this is 53 light beige
this has a gel consistency and when you
apply it to your skin it feels so
hydrating and smooth it sinks right into
the skin
the only thing I don't absolutely love
about this is the scent it has a very
strong scent it's not a bad scent it's
just very strong but it goes away after
you blend it in I purchased these on
Amazon it has light to medium coverage
but I definitely think you can build it
up it just makes me look youthful and
fresh I also have two Rimmel lasting
finish foundations I purchased this
because I wanted to do a waterproof test
makeup tutorial but summer came and went
and I've never filmed it I actually
haven't used this foundation yet because
I'm waiting for that video all I know is
that I hear people raving about it
supposedly it's a very long wearing
foundation and it was really affordable
I have two shades 100 I hurry and 200
soft beige and then the last foundation
on this row is the Becca aqua luminous
perfecting foundation I had a phase
where I was using this constantly but
then I kind of stopped using it once I
was having those really bad skin issue
I highly recommend this foundation if
you have dry skin and you don't need
much coverage because this is like the
sheerest foundation I have but if you're
looking for something really sheer and
really dewy something that will just
even out your skin tone and make it look
extra hydrated and extra healthy then I
recommend this I love this foundation in
the summer this is the benefit hello
flawless oxygen Wow foundation it has an
SPF of 25 and it's oil-free I would
consider this like pretty average I have
drugstore foundations I love more than
this it's nice it's just not amazing the
coverage is sheer but you can get a
medium coverage after I build up about
two layers of this oh by the way in the
benefit Foundation I'm in the shade
light in this foundation I'm in the
shade ivory again this is another one of
those perfect for dry skin and it's just
nice it's like an average it's okay it's
like you know not the best but not the
worst for sure next up is this Sonia
Kashuk soft focus satin matte foundation
I picked up the shade vanilla but it is
a little bit too light for me I haven't
tried this foundation yet it's actually
pretty new I just picked this up at
Target I wanted to review it but since
it was too light I have to go back and
get another shade some people hate it
some people love it I'm not sure leave
me a comment down below do you like this
foundation do you think I would like
this foundation the bottle was so
beautiful I just had to pick it up how
stunning is this Sonia Kashuk packaging
next up I have to make up for ever ultra
HD foundations I have why co5 normally
and then 127 is when I'm like really
really tan there was a point where this
was like my ultimate holy grail or at
least second after the face and body but
I've just been using other foundations
over this I love it though I do like
this formula better than their older one
I think it's a little bit more
natural-looking than their original HD
it looks beautiful on photography it
goes on really smooth it's not too dewy
it's not too matte I would say it has
more of a satin finish next up is the
Laura Mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation I also had a phase where I
was wearing this non-stop this is in the
shade dusk it actually reminds me a lot
of the Becca one with a little bit more
coverage and this one is also not as
dewy I don't know there's something
about it that just makes your skin look
so fresh the only thing with this is
that I have to 100
and set it this will settle right into
my smile lines most foundations do on me
I have like very deep smile lines I
guess and foundations love to live in
those lines but this one especially like
really gets in them lines but I look
past that because the finish is so
pretty when I just want something really
natural and beautiful I will go for this
I mean I have a lot of foundations that
are very natural but this one is a good
one and I like that it has a pump I also
have this Laura Mercier foundation this
is their silk cream moisturizing photo
edition foundation this one is the one
for dry skin and then they have another
one for oily skin I really love this I
just don't use it as often because it's
in the shade bamboo beige and this is
way too dark for me but the finish is
really beautiful it have that moosie
consistency oh that color doesn't look
too bad the coverage is really really
great on this one I get full coverage
and it just makes your skin look
flawless literally Columbus this is the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation I no longer owned the one for
dry skin and inures thinking what you
like the matte and poreless more than
the dry skin one and actually I do
believe it or not there's something
about this foundation even though it has
a matte finish it looks perfect it
doesn't cling on to any dry skin this is
one of my favorite drugstore foundations
hands down it fills in the pores really
nice and it's just not too matte it
doesn't have that flat dry look to your
skin
I like this foundation way more than the
L'Oreal one that's matte next up is
another drugstore favorite for me this
is the Milani conceal imperfect
two-in-one foundation and concealer this
in the shade creamy vanilla it's a
little bit too yellow for my skin tone
but I make it work because I really
really like the finish this has extreme
coverage there's a reason why they call
it foundation and concealer it's very
thick and it's also very moosie let me
show you it's like fake look at that leg
- thick look at that you even see like
it has like little whipped mountains the
more you blend it in the more natural it
looks I don't know how to explain it my
favorite way to use this foundation is
definitely with a Beauty Blender I just
feel like the finish is a little bit
more natural if I use a brush it will
look too cakey it'll look way too heavy
on my dry skin a little goes a very long
way with this guy it will look cakey if
you apply too much so be really careful
with this one but when I shear it out it
just
looks so flawless next up is the Kiko
universal fit hydrating foundation I
love this foundation because it's in a
squeezy tube if I ever had a makeup
brand my foundations would be in a
squeezy tube
I loved squeezy tubes way more than I
liked foundations with a pump just
because I feel like you really squeeze
out all of the product and they're so
travel friendly like you could just
throw this in a makeup bag I also had an
obsession with this foundation at one
point I was using it all the time it
looks really nice on the skin it's not
too dewy but it's not too matte I
wouldn't say it's extremely hydrating
but it doesn't emphasize any of my dry
skin and that's all I can ask for really
I love this Kiko is one of the more
affordable brands and I think this
foundation is completely underrated next
up is the elf moisturizing foundation
stick oh by the way in the Kiko
foundation I'm in the shade light beige
in this foundation I'm in the shade nude
major downside to this elf foundation is
the color selection sucks this our
nation is awesome it's very very
moisturizing like they ain't kidding
it's very moisturizing very dewy very
hydrating but it's just so practical I
love the fact that it's in a stick you
just paint this on your face you blend
it in with a brush or a sponge and
you're good to go this is definitely my
favorite foundation stick at the
drugstore I have a whole drugstore
foundation stick video I will link it
down below I also have a high-end
version I will link it down below I
reviewed a bunch of foundation sticks
next up is one of my favorite
foundations of all time I also think
this foundation is pretty underrated
there was a time where a lot of people
were talking about it on YouTube but I
feel like people stopped talking about
it this is the ex1 and visit Foundation
and have the shade F 100 and F 200 when
I'm like you know super tan and Jennifer
Love is I don't know what it is about
this that I love so much but every time
I put it on I'm like wow I need to wear
this foundation more often I do believe
it looks invisible on the skin when you
put it on you don't tell yourself like
wow I look like I'm wearing foundation
it looks like your skin it looks very
natural but the coverage is there I get
really great coverage out of this and it
wears for a super long time I have
nothing negative to say about this
literally I love that has a pump I love
the packaging I love everything about
this foundation next up is the covergirl
outlast stay luminous foundation I'm in
the shade 842 this foundation
currently a little bit too dark for me I
don't really wear it often I haven't
worn it in a while but I keep it because
I like it it has a slight shimmer to it
if you look at the bottle really closely
there's like a golden sheen and I would
usually stay far far away from that but
it looks so pretty in the summer time I
couldn't get enough I remember I was
wearing this non-stop at one point as
well you cannot see that in the video at
all you cannot tell that there's glitter
on your face unless you get really
really close to a camera or a mirror I'm
sorry it just looks like your face
naturally has a beautiful golden glow to
it I don't know I really like it
it's a luminous foundation that has
really really good coverage which
sometimes it's hard to find that I keep
a Too Faced Born This Way Foundation in
hopes that I'll fall in love with it
someday I've always been on the fence
with this sometimes I hate it sometimes
it's okay
I don't know it looks a little bit heavy
on my skin it looks a little bit cakey
it's not a must-have for me I can do
without it
but I hold on to it because I I just I
don't know I want to love it so bad but
I'm in the shade porcelain and sometimes
it looks nice you know but sometimes it
doesn't I don't know is this one of your
favorites let me know this is the co
jindo aqua foundation and no girl does
suspensive but i love it
I don't know what makes this foundation
so unique to me I am in love with the
finish of this it makes your skin look
dewy in a naturally dewy way like if
your foundation or like your skin is
naturally that dewy
it's so beautiful I'm in the shade to
1/3 it's a little bit olive tone for me
I would say the coverage is light to
medium but you could definitely build
this up in my opinion it never looks
cakey I can apply layer after layer it's
not as sheer as the make up forevers
face and body but it is as liquidy and
it's as hydrating it just has more
coverage it just looks really beautiful
I don't explain it it's really beautiful
I personally think it's worth the money
this is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
foundation this is the shade light sand
it's a little bit too pink for me even
though it doesn't look pink in the
bottle for some reason when I apply this
to my skin it oxidizes to like a
slightly pink color but I keep it and I
use it because I love this foundation I
rarely wear it on camera but I wear it
off camera all the time it's a water
foundation but it has more of a matte
natural finish
at least on my skin this looks so pretty
it dries really fast so you have to work
with it really fast but once it's dry
and it's on your skin it just makes your
skin look flawless it has really good
coverage it's SPF 15 and even though it
has SPF I don't think it has a white
flash back in photos I have a mini
version of the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation this is also expensive
but this smaller bottle is less
expensive but still expensive
considering you get so little product I
can't make this foundation work I try to
love it it looks so greasy on me I
always say this but it makes it look
like a greasy hot dog after like 5 hours
I don't know what it is but this our
nation does not last on the skin at all
but I keep it because initially when you
first apply it your skin looks amazing
so I mean I keep it for like videos if I
want to wear it in my videos because it
makes your skin look so beautiful but if
I want to wear this out I mean I don't I
don't wear this out it breaks down
really easily after a few hours and it
just looks a little bit too greasy for
me this is the Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation this is an average foundation
for me if I'm going to be honest it
looks really pretty on the skin but when
I wear it I don't look in the mirror and
think like wow my skin looks really nice
it just doesn't do much for me I might
declutter this at some point in the near
future I just I really like the bottle
and I really love Charlotte Tilbury soit
I hold on to it I'm in the shade of 4 I
like the finish it's just not them it's
not it's not anything special in my
opinion now these babies are special
like my socks right here in the corner I
had to stand my knees on fire this is
the Dior air flash foundation I have two
shades I have 201 which is my normal
shade and I have 300 which is when I am
tan this foundation is amazing amazing I
can't even express it it's very
expensive but I do think it's worth the
money it's supposed to give you kind of
like an airbrush look the packaging is a
little bit weird it's kind of hard to
use because it comes out like literally
like Shh that was my sound effect of
foundation spraying out of this it's
supposed to give you like an airbrush
flawless look and I 1000% agree
I love spraying this on the back of my
hand and then going in with a Beauty
Blender and applying it that way because
if you try to spray this
directly on your face it gets everywhere
when I did the benefit gondola I was
wearing this foundation when I did my
makeup geek photoshoot I was wearing
this shawl nation I just haven't used it
in a few months because last time I use
this I broke out so badly which is
really weird because this foundation
never made me break out before and I'm
kind of scared to test it out again but
I have to because I love it so much if
you are looking for that foundation that
is going to give you a flawless airbrush
porcelain look look into this one even
though is pricey I think you should get
a sample at Sephora because it is
spectacular this is the Shiseido
synchros skin lasting liquid foundation
it's oil-free SPF 20 and it's also
amazing I love this it has a pump mine
broke a little bit but you know I feel
like I'm saying the same thing for every
foundation so please forgive me if I
sound repetitive but it has a beautiful
finish I would say it's a nice satin
finish it has amazing coverage very full
coverage for me and it lasts forever on
the skin I can wear this for hours and
hours and hours it looks amazing next up
is the Smashbox Studios skin 15 hour
hydrating foundation I recently had this
but then I decluttered it but then
smashbox sent it to me again so i just
threw it in here and i don't know but
mine is getting really weird it's like
really yellow at the top and then it's
like fading here i don't know what the
deal with that is it's extremely long
wearing and it looks really nice on the
skin but i don't know if I love it yet
I'm still going to play around with it a
little bit more I think it's great for
those of you who have dry skin but can't
seem to find a foundation that lasts and
covers well I have the cover FX custom
cover drops here this is just something
you can drop into like a little
foundation cocktail to make your
foundation more pigmented you get more
coverage with this and then next I have
this ridiculously overpriced Tom Ford
Foundation I bought this specifically to
review from my high-end foundation stick
video it's their traceless foundation
stick and it's nothing out of this world
honestly it's like $80.00 so ridiculous
so expensive pants I don't think this
foundation is worth the money it looks
nice and it blends well but for the
money
I just wasn't wowed so for that reason I
would never repurchase this again and I
wouldn't recommend it now
these guys that's a different story I'm
obsessed with these this is the Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof long wear
foundation I used to have the Urban
Decay Naked Skin Foundation but after I
discovered these I gave my naked skin
away because I just I was never using it
and I find these to be better than the
naked skin I am in two shades
I'm in 3.25 and 3.0 I like to mix these
together that's that's what gives me my
perfect shade there's like hair
everywhere I love this foundation I
can't rave about it enough I've spoken
about this like a hundred times it's
super super super full coverage this is
a foundation I was wearing when I had
like really bad skin issues my skin was
very very bumpy very red and the only
thing that was covering it to where I
felt comfortable was this bad boy right
here it's very very long wearing and it
looks flawless just don't apply too much
because it can get cakey I hear a lot of
people with dry skin do not like this
foundation personally for me it didn't
emphasize my dry skin I don't know I
guess it's just one of those hit-or-miss
things and for me it definitely oh it
definitely was a hit this is the elf
acne fighting foundation I had this a
long time ago but then I got rid of it
and I'll actually just recently sent
this to me again I want to try it out
again because I haven't used it in a
really really long time but I do
remember liking it I just don't know why
I got rid of it it has salicylic acid
witch hazel tree and aloe supposedly
it's great for breakouts it's never
broken me up so I mean that's a good
thing this is the lingerie Depot
foundation by girl on invisible skin
fusion foundation with sunscreen SPF 20
it is a pricey pricy foundation but it
looks beautiful on the skin every time I
wear it I'm like wow this foundation is
really good it doesn't cling on to any
of the dry skin it looks it looks like
your skin honestly it does I really
don't have anything negative to say
about it besides the price and even
though it has SPF it doesn't have a
flashback in photography not that I've
noticed
I have some foundation sticks here from
doing my recent foundation stick video
this one is from flower beauty it's the
skin cava neato stick foundation this
one is the NYX mineral foundation stick
and this one is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills foundation I have reviews on these
products so I don't want to go into too
much detail like I said I will link them
below
these two I really like they're very
dewy very natural
this Anastasio one is definitely suited
more for those of you with oily skin now
I have another foundation stick that I
also spoke about in that video this is
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD I prefer
this over the original Ultra HD
I love the stick so much more it's just
so easy to apply it blends in like a
dream I love this it's really really
really great for those of you with dry
skin and then the last foundation in
this little box the rest are here off to
the side this is the ardency in
americana custom coverage concentrate
this one is alright it's a it's too
moussey for me it's like very thick I
thought I liked it in the beginning but
the more I use it the more I don't
really like it it's very very thick and
moosie I don't know it's not my favorite
looks a little bit cakey I liked it at
first but it emphasizes my texture too
much and also this is another one of
those foundations that really settles
into these smile lines so I'm actually
going to get rid of that this isn't a
declutter video but I'm gonna give that
away I have three of the hourglass
vanish Foundation Stix these are three
different shades
I have buff bisque and warm ivory warm
ivory is my summer shade like I said a
hundred times I already have a review on
this so I'm not going to go into much
detail but this is probably my favorite
foundation stick of all time I
definitely think it's worth your money a
little goes a very long way and you get
really full coverage and your skin just
looks so natural but flawless I don't
know I love this stuff and then the last
foundations I have to talk about our
these guys right here this is newer to
my collection these are the la girl pro
coverage HD long wear illuminating
foundations they have a white shade
which is awesome to mix with other
foundations to get your custom shade
I love the formula on the white one it's
the same as these but it's really really
good and then I have the shade fair
which is my current shade and then I
have this one in nude beige this on
nation is so beautiful I just recently
spoke about it in a favorites video it's
very very dewy but with a little bit of
setting powder it's amazing it still
remains natural and dewy but not like
super wet once you set it I get full
coverage out of this and I get a very
long wear out of it as well considering
