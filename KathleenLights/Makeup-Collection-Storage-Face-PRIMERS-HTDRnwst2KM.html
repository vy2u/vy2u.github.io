video in my makeup collection series I'm
doing I'm splitting up my makeup
collection in sections so I did
foundations a few days ago I will link
foundations down below if you want to
see my full foundation collection today
we're going to tackle primers I'm going
to show you my entire primer collection
and where I keep it in my drawer and
even though for foundations I had a
really cute setup and the foundations
look really pretty that's not the case
for my primers they're really just
thrown in my drawer so it's not much
about storage this one I gotta say I'm
not very good with storing my primers if
you have any advice any tips what I can
do to store my primers in a better way
please let me know I plan on doing these
kinds of videos maybe twice a month is
that good enough for you guys or do you
want me to spread it out more is this
like too soon also let me know what you
want to see next in this makeup
collection and storage series I'm doing
so yeah we want to see all the primers I
own and what I think about my primers
then just keep watching first of all
have you seen a cuter dog before in your
life
No so as you guys know I showed you this
in my last makeup collection video I
keep my foundations in the top drawer
today we're tackling this drawer ah this
drawer for some reason it's hard to open
oh what a mess so this is where I keep
my primers I have my primers all along
here I keep my high end concealers here
and then I keep my drugstore concealers
here and then I keep my beady creams
tinted moisturizers all that jazz back
here I was going to do this entire
drawer in one video but I it was gonna
be fifty minutes long so next time I do
this drawer I'm gonna do my tinted
moisturizers and my concealers in one
video because I can go through these
pretty quickly so let me know if that's
what you want to see next
my tinted moisturizers and my concealers
so feel free to give me any advice on
how to store these things because right
now it's like oh you see this one's
supposed to be thin this one as well I
also need to upgrade my storage let me
organize this so I'm gonna start off
with these primers and then I'll talk
about the ones in the back I keep all
the to be style primers here laying down
and then I keep
the one in the bottle is standing up
just because I don't know how else to
store these I would like to store them
standing up but I just I need I need a
better strategy happy dr. Brandt pores
no more pore refining primer I got this
because I think Nicole Guerrero was
raving about this a lot at one point so
I picked it up based on her
recommendation and I actually really
really love this primer it leaves your
skin so silky so smooth I don't
typically go for the pore filling type
of primer because I have very dry skin
so I prefer a primer that's very
hydrating and these tend to be not so
moisturizing but I actually love using
this in combination with a more
hydrating primer I'll just take a very
small amount of this and tap it right
into my pores and I swear it like it
vanishes them out of all the pore
filling primers I've ever tried I think
this is the best one in my opinion it
really does fill in your pores this is
the Embera Leslie creme concentrate I
picked this up because my friend Gaby
really loves this this is a great
moisturizing primer very very hydrating
a lot of makeup artists use this it's a
really nice base product to work with
especially if you have dry skin this
isn't going to fill in your pores or
anything it's just extremely hydrating
oh my gosh I just realized I didn't need
my lectures on water I was like man it's
letting have Dora don't point of leaving
this pillow here cuz I'm not using it
okay back to what I was saying this
isn't going to fill in your pores or
anything it's just a really great
hydrating base it feels more like a
skincare product versus an actual primer
at one point I had all of the makeup
over step one skin equalisers now I have
two I've kind of given away the other
ones I wasn't really using any of them
oh wait no I don't have to I have 3
where's my other one I don't like I did
give that away ok I'm losing my mind
well this video is all over the place ok
I found myself constantly using these
and not any of the other ones I have the
green one this is the correct redness
correcting primer anytime I have a skin
irritation where my face is really
really red this is the primer I will
wear I always keep it on deck for that
reason I don't use it all the time
because I only use it when I have a lot
of redness but it's a faithful one so I
keep it with me and then this one is the
hydrating primer it's my favorite out of
all of them it's very soothing on the
skin it almost feels cooling when I put
it on it's very very lightweight I love
the consistency it's kind of milky but
it's just not thick at all not greasy
I wear this when my skin is feeling
pretty normal not when it's extremely
dry because when it's a little bit too
dry I need to use a different kind of
primer but I love this this is a cover
effects illuminating primer actually I
haven't had this one for that long I
want to say I used to have this primer
but I don't remember and I don't
remember if I loved it or not but they
recently sent this to me I'm thinking
they changed the formula or something
not sure I have to play around with this
a little bit more but I love anything
illuminating and I love cover effects
they make great great products so I'm
sure you'll hear me talk about this the
more I play around with it it has such a
pretty finish very glowy but not too
greasy it's it feels really really nice
this is the Laura Geller spackle
hydrating moisturizing under makeup
primer this one also feels really
lightweight but it's a little bit
thicker it's a little bit stickier than
the makeup for everyone definitely not
as watery this one is it's a little bit
more hydrating it feels more like a
typical moisturizer this stuff is
awesome I actually really really love
this primer I find it to be very
moisturizing but very long wearing at
the same time it's one of those primers
that makes my makeup last a really long
time on my skin and most hydrating
primers really can't offer that so I
really like this one this is the NYX
Born to glow illuminating primer one of
my favorite drugstore primers it's such
a pretty iridescent sheen on the face it
is intense but in the most beautiful way
ever it's very very very glowy I love
wearing this underneath more matte
foundations because it just gives it a
pick-me-up gives life to dull skin it's
a really good one and it gives you such
a beautiful Sheen to the face without
looking greasy or heavy I highly
recommend this one if you are looking to
glow not so much to be moisturized but
to be glowy this is my favorite
drugstore primer this is the NYX angel
veil I love this this is a dupe for the
hourglass mineral veil primer and I
think it's even better than that one
it's oil free it's very smoothing it
just makes makeup apply so much nicer it
gives your face kind of like a smooth
porcelain feel perfect for those of you
with oily skin but I don't find it
drying at all so I do think even those
of you as normal to dry skin might like
this I just love how foundation applies
on top of it this is like a big bottle I
don't remember where I got this from I'm
like almost
of this I need to purchase another one
next angel Ville is the good stuff I
want to talk about these two as one
because I find them to be almost
identical this is the Too Faced hangover
RX replenishing face primer and then
this one is the glossy a priming
moisturizer I'm going to talk about both
of them because I have the exact same
thing to say about both of them Wow okay
this one by Too Faced smells really good
at smells like coconuts it has coconut
water in it it's very very hydrating it
has that milky consistency similar to
the makeup for everyone but this one is
way way more hydrating it's a little bit
more nourishing and this just sinks
right into the skin and it really does
hydrate the crap out of your face and
same goes for this guy it has the same
milky texture the same consistency and
it's ultra hydrating these are my two
most hydrating foundations like when my
skin is dry as can be I will pop these
guys on I do think that the glossy a one
is just a hair more moisturizing this is
the primer I go to when my skin is the
driest but they're both very very
similar this is the it cosmetics bye bye
pores primer oil-free poreless skin
perfecting serum primer I know not a lot
of people like this but I really love
this I feel like it's a combination
between a pore filler and a more
hydrating primer because I feel like it
does both it sinks into the skin and it
helps smooth out the skin and fill in
the pores but at the same time it's not
drying the way other pore fillers are it
almost feels silky the your glow
Maximizer like boosting primer is your
best friend if you want to look like
Jenny from the block it is my most glowy
primer for sure it has such a beautiful
golden sheen as opposed to my other
primers that are a little bit more
pearly this one has a gold
reflex to it I don't know if you could
tell in the back of my hand right there
but on the face when you apply this
primer you look like Jennifer Lopez or
at least that's what I tell myself I
mean look at the difference the bottom
one is Jenny from the block and the top
one it's just it's just Kathleen it's
not hydrating by any means but it just
gives you a golden glow from within and
then I have these two from Laura Mercier
this is the foundation primer they're
both in radiance only one is radiance
bronze and one is the regular radiance
the one in radiance was my go-to for a
really long time
if you've watched any of my primer
videos you know that this one holds a
very special place in my heart I used
this for like a year
non-stop it was the only foundation I
used off-camera I was addicted to this
at one point I do say that I like it
more than the dorwan because sometimes
did your one can get a little bit too
thick it'll clump up right here at the
top and that can drive me crazy it's
still amazing but the laura mercier one
is a little bit more toned down a little
bit more wearable you still want a
really pretty golden glow underneath
your foundation but you don't want it to
be too much I would recommend this one
and then the radiance bronze one I used
to love using this in the summer I would
mix it in with the regular radians
because alone it's a little bit too dark
for me as you can tell but this on your
face in the summer time
oh my gosh it gives your face such a
beautiful warmth I don't think these
primers make my makeup last longer they
just make my makeup look prettier so I
like that okay so let's talk about these
guys back here I have the Garlon primer
with the gold flecks in it I'm not sure
what the name is radiance concentrate
with pure gold this primer is like an
arm and a leg
I bought it to review in my luxury
makeup video honestly I was probably the
wrong candidate for this it's supposed
to be very firming and lifting it's
probably better for those with mature
skin because I felt like it really
didn't do anything for me so honestly I
just don't find any use for this I'm
actually gonna give this to my mom cuz I
feel like she might really like this
alright I don't know why I've been
holding on to that this is the LC pearl
radiance primer I picked this up because
I heard Jacqueline Hill raving about it
and I really really liked it it's not my
favorite but I haven't really played
around with it that much it feels a lot
like the it cosmetics when I spoke about
but it feels more hydrating them a
little bit more moisturizing I really
like how it feels on the skin and
Foundation applies really nicely on top
I have to play around with it a little
bit more but so far so good
this is the Kat Von D hydrating primer
base I've only used this like two times
so I can't tell you how I feel about it
I don't know I'm on the fence it has a
typical milky consistency that a lot of
hydrating primers do but I don't know
what makes this one stand out from the
rest of them I don't know it just feels
a little bit too ordinary for me that
sounds weird I don't know I have to play
around a little bit more I've only used
it twice I liked it when I used it but
it's not my favorite I just I got tested
out more the amani perfect ten prime
serum is probably one of my favorite
primers of all time it does so many
things it has like ten benefits to it
very natural ingredients it has kind of
like a sticky feeling on the skin but I
feel like that is what helps the
foundation stay and cling on to my face
it makes my foundation last a really
long time but it's very hydrating not
too sticky not like gross sticky but I
mean it's tacky it holds on to that
foundation I love this so much I feel
like it creates a really nice barrier
between your foundation and your face
this is a Smashbox photo finish primer
oil this stuff is pretty good but it's
definitely not my favorite primer oil I
have two other primers that have this
kind of consistency that I prefer so
it's not my favorite but it is really
good it's also really nice to mix in
with your foundations if you have a
foundation that's a little bit too matte
but the oily primer I really do love is
this this is the hourglass number 28
primer serum hydrating and anti-aging
this stuff is so expensive
oh that's expensive but it's so amazing
like I'm telling you guys unless you
have chronic dry skin do not wear this
it's pretty much like an oil and when
you rub this into your face it I don't
know it transforms your dry skin it just
feels so intensely nourishing but I
don't find that it slips and slides or
that it's like oily and greasy and weird
awesome if you have like thick dry
patches on your skin especially in the
winter I love this I have these two
primers by a cosmetics I have the feel
the moment skin rejuvenating hydrating
primer serum and I have the number 50
serum collagen veil anti-aging primer
this primer is very similar to the
hourglass one like very very similar I
just haven't played around with this one
enough to see if I like it as much as
the hourglass one but I really do like
it very hydrating very nourishing one of
those oily primers that I recommend to
those of you with super dry skin and
then this one is really nice too because
it kind of feels like a skin care
product it's like you're applying a
really delicious serum a skin care
product underneath your foundation has
that milky texture but it's different I
don't know how to explain it it kind of
feels like it's smoothing out the skin
and perfecting it while it's hydrating
it at the same time the hourglass veil
mineral primer is a cult favorite I feel
but I stand by my work
I think the Knicks angel veil is better
than this one I feel like they do the
exact same thing so why pay more for
this one when you can get this one
oh no they're both really incredible not
going to lie but is why I keep this
because it is really good it smooths out
the skin it kind of makes your face feel
porcelain like I don't know very strange
consistency but it's good I have the
Natasha de Nona face glow primer
hydrating underbase can you believe I've
had this in my drawer for months and I
haven't used it yet I might have used it
once or twice but I don't remember I
need to get on this because I remember
being so excited to own it yet I haven't
really put it to the test but I will I
will I promise you I will and then the
last primer back here is this thing
these are one of those products I don't
use but I keep just in case you ever
have those things like oh I need to keep
that you know just in case this is the
murad invisiblur perfecting shield
broad-spectrum SPF 30 blurs and protects
I keep this because it's cool I mean
it's a SPF but it's also a pore filling
primer I heard people rave about this I
just I don't know I don't go for things
like this usually I'll use a different
kind of sunscreen but I don't know this
might be a really good thing for this
summer well that's the last of it okay
guys so those were all of my primers I
hope you guys enjoyed this video leave
me a comment down below if you have a
primer that you really love that I don't
currently have or that you haven't seen
me talk about in the past cuz maybe I
maybe I got rid of it but I don't know
let me know maybe I will check it out oh
