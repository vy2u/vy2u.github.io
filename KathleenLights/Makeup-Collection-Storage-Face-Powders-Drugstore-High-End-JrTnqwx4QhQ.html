another one of my makeup collection and
storage videos as you guys know I've
been showing you little pieces of my
native collection we've done foundations
primers eyeshadow palettes with those of
you and I like doing them this way
because I get to talk about each
individual product and I find that to be
more helpful than showing you like my
entire collection when I am done showing
you everything I will do an overview of
the room I'm still figuring out what to
do with this room there's so many things
in here that I'm not happy with there's
something about this room or the way
it's setup something that just there's
something missing this I need to change
it up and every day I'm slowly doing
that little by little making little
changes here and then once I'm
comfortable with it I will be showing
you an entire overview anyway today we
are going to be taking a look at all of
my powders those powders powders
translucent powders foundation powders
all of that stuff will go to my powder
drawer and I'll show you everything give
you my thoughts and all I have a lot of
powders considering I don't love powder
I have dry skin so I am very picky with
my powders but somehow I have so many I
don't know anyway if you want to see all
of my powder then you know just keep
watching okay so you're familiar with
these drawers I told you guys in a
previous video the story of why this is
really white and why this is kind of
like an off-white but that has nothing
to do with this video I just want to let
you know that this one is my foundation
drawer this one is where I kept on my
primers you've been there but now we are
diving into the one at the bottom so
this is the drawer I keep all my face
powders in well I keep my setting sprays
in this drawer as well I want to make a
lot of changes to my Beauty room soon
but for now this is how I keep my
setting sprays and my powders and
honestly I don't know why I have so many
damn siding sprays back there because I
really only use this one now so I mean
I'm out I need to go through that I need
to get rid of a couple of those oh my
gosh but a lot of them are so good so
this is where I keep my powders I keep
them in these little acrylic organizers
that I got from by allegory you can get
my allegory on Amazon or awfully by
allegory website and most of them fit in
here for the most part you know these
little compacts will fit here but
sometimes you'll get compacts like this
or like this and so will they be sweet
so
like these off to the side and
especially like loose powders that
obviously don't fit in there I have dog
hair all over the place and what is this
like this can you see this the first
part is the NYX HD finishing powder in
the shade banana surprisingly I actually
really really like this most of the time
I don't like these banana powders I
didn't like the Ben Nye one it was just
way too dark for my skin tone and
usually most of these banana shades are
they're just too yellow for me but this
one isn't I think it brightens up the
under eye and it does set the under-eye
really nicely it's not too powdery and
it's not too much I thought it would be
at first but if you apply a light hand
this could look really nice underneath
the eye this one has recently become a
new favorite of mine is so dirty I use
it all the time this is the elf
finishing powder in the shade fair slash
light I love this if you are looking for
a really great powder at the drugstore
that isn't going to emphasize any dry
skin but it's just going to lightly set
your makeup and give you a very soft
look you need this powder in your life
it's perfect for my dry skin and it just
looks beautiful on my skin I really love
it so lightweight just makes my skin
look so soft and smooth I it's not a
glaring powder but sometimes I feel like
it blurs my makeup I just love the
formula it's so buttery and it looks so
pretty on the skin so I've been loving
this a lot this is an old favorite of
mine this is the Maybelline fit me
powder in the shade 135 creamy natural
if you've been on my channel for a long
time you definitely have seen this
before I used to use it all the time to
set underneath my eyes it's such a
creamy silky powder and there's kind of
like a very slight very very very slight
sheen to it but just brightens the under
eyes so nicely I think this shade is
actually discontinued I had to buy mine
on Amazon because I couldn't find it in
store anymore which totally sucks
this is a powder I thought I was
absolutely going to hate this is the
Catrice prime and fine mattifying powder
I bought this because it's waterproof
and I had wanted to do a full waterproof
makeup tutorial and test it out in my
mom's pool I was going to do the whole
tutorial and dive right in and we were
going to test that but then summer came
in left and I never did it but I am
thinking of doing that once the spring
and summer come around but anyway that's
why I bought this powder but I actually
really liked it I thought
I hate it because it says it's
mattifying and it's waterproof and I
thought I was going to be taking and
gross but the powder is so finely milled
that when you put it on your face it
doesn't apply too much and even though I
don't like matte skin sometimes I'll
just go overboard with the doing this
and I need to tone it down and this is
always the powder I grab what I need to
do that this is the Too Faced cocoa
powder foundation and this is the shade
light/medium I have to say I don't
really have an opinion on this because
I've had this for weeks now and I
haven't even used this I always mean to
in the back of my head I'm always like
oh my gosh I still haven't used that to
face powder foundation but I need to try
it I definitely need to try it I haven't
heard anybody really talk about this
that makes me feel like it's not going
to be very good but I will be testing it
soon remind you guys remind me same goes
for this next powder this is the la girl
pro face HD matte pressed powder I guess
I haven't tried it because it says matte
and every time I grab a powder I usually
just grab something else but leave me a
comment down below and let me know what
you think about this I am obsessed with
their pro foundation their new HD
foundation is amazing I absolutely love
it but I just haven't tried this out but
have you is it really good let me know
this next powder is the Too Faced primes
and poreless powder I love the packaging
of this powder is so beautiful this is
not the kind of harder you grab if you
just want to like set your makeup this
is one of those powders that's really
going to blur out the skin it's just
going to fill in your pores so I do
really like this but I don't like it as
much as my a cosmetics one I have one
from a cosmetics that does this and it's
way better this one just kind of
deposits a little bit too much product
for me it cosmetics one is a little bit
lighter on the skin so I don't really
use this one I keep it for like
comparison videos in the future or
something I don't know why I keep it
honestly but yeah I don't it's good I
just don't love it as much of this day
this is the it cosmetics 5 ice cores
airbrush silk pressed finishing powder
and I'm obsessed with this I think this
is my like third powder of these which
is crazy because I don't really go
through powders all that much this is
hands-down my absolute favorite power
when it comes to these pore minimizing
powders the ones that blur the skin you
see how much like less product comes up
here it's not as heavy as a two-faced
one this blur is my force it's amazing I
love
it's so much definitely my favorite I
just the best next up is the Milani prep
set and glow illuminating transparent
powder this stuff is really good but I
only like using this as a light dusting
on the face if I apply too much of this
it will start to look heavy on my skin
but if I just take a big fluffy brush
and just swipe this on my entire face
after I have already powdered my face
down this gives me such a beautiful soft
glow like a barely-there glow but it's
very very nice and I love that it's from
the drugstore so this is good stuff I'm
in love with Riaan
hi and here's Mellon this is the wet and
wild photo focused pressed powder and
I'm in the shade warm light and I'm
obsessed with this this is probably my
favorite face powder from the drugstore
I feel like it sets my foundation down
so beautifully without looking heavy
it makes my dry skin look beautiful I
love it I don't think it's chalky or I
don't know some drugstore powders are a
little chalky this one is very smooth
and very creamy I like it this next one
is Big Daddy
this is features armani luminous silk
compacts your youth powder compacts this
is the luminous silk foundation in a
powder form and i truly truly love this
i wish i hated it because it is a very
pricey found like powder foundation i
paid a lot of money for it but oh my
gosh i can apply pounds and pounds and
pounds of this powder to my face and it
never ever looks cakey it never looks
dry or cracked or like i'm wearing a ton
of powder this looks absolutely
beautiful i am not a huge fan of the
luminous silk foundation and you know
but for me that powder was a true winner
i never really use this on its own i
don't think it has like enough coverage
for me to use by itself but it looks
stunning on top of foundation just to
add a hair more coverage and it's so
silky and so smooth and it really says
look beautiful on the skin i can't deny
this nice powder i think is as close as
it gets to the luminous silk powder i
just showed you this one is very similar
and before I bought the luminous silk
one and this was my Holy Grail high-end
powder this is the Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder in the shade medium one
thing I gotta say the color selection
sucks I think she only has like three
colors which is ridiculous but when you
like rub your fingers over this powder
it feels like butter like the creamiest
form
in the entire world it looks so
beautiful on the skin everything I said
about the luminous silk one I have to
say about this
the only difference to me is that I
could really pack on the luminous soap
powder and I don't think it looks bad
and I mean I could do the same for this
one too honestly I don't know I don't
know they're both really really amazing
honestly this next powder is from H&amp;amp;M
they have their own makeup line and this
is the perfectionist finishing powder in
the shade of porcelain
honestly I really like this I've used it
a ton I keep it because it is extremely
brightening I keep it mainly for the
shade I love this shade so so bright and
sometimes when I use a concealer that's
a little bit too dark for me underneath
my eyes or I just want to really take
the brightness up I always open this
drawer and retrieve powder because it's
always just like instantly brands my
under eyes not like in a luminous way
and like a literally it looks brighter
kind of way I don't use this on my
entire face just because I prefer
formulas of other ones this is just for
a neck my under eyes for a cake the NARS
crystal powder and the shade translucent
is really nice oh my gosh why was that
so hard to open it is they're pressed
version of their light reflecting powder
and mine is like scratches all up in it
because when I first got it I like
scraped the crap out of it because I
really have to learn to love this this
powder is very weird when you swatch it
like look at this I'm going ham on this
and look like barely anything comes off
on my fingers just like a really light
and veil powder comes off this is so
great to set underneath the eyes without
adding too much product but it still
gives you a light reflecting look I just
going to brush like this this is the
Real Techniques setting powder like this
and like really get all up in there and
then I set my under eyes like that and I
think it's really nice it will give you
a white cast in photos if you apply too
much so just be careful with that I
thought this the other day on the
Sephora website and I purchased it this
is the cover FX perfect pressed powder
in the shade light I have not used this
yet but I'm really excited to use it
because I love cover FX products rarely
do I come across a cover FX part I don't
like so I really really am excited to
try this if you so creamy oh my go I
can't wait and then the last powder in
my little allegory section is the
maybelline superstay better skin
skin transforming powder just a shade of
warm nude and this is obviously too dug
for my skin tone right now this is my
summer shade and I only use it once in
the summer and I really don't remember
how I felt about it so I'm just waiting
until I have at the self tan on or I
have a little bit more color in the
summer to try this out again because
I've heard so many rave reviews on this
powder people love it I don't really
like the packaging it's a little like
bulky to me but I heard nothing but good
things about this so I cannot wait to
try it out okay so now we're going to
make our way to this side let's talk
about all of the loose powders first
I've got to be honest I don't really
love loose powder it's just a little bit
too messy for me but these that I
discovered I really really like and I
take the mess because I think it's worth
this is the cover FX perfect setting
powder I'm in the shade translucent
light I love this I have been using it
so much recently it's like the only
powder I've been using honestly I love
it way more than the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder when I first
got the Laura Mercier one I really liked
it in the beginning but I think that my
skin got a little drier or something
that I don't really love it I think this
one is better and I really like it I've
been using it to set my entire face to
set underneath my eyes it gives your
skin like a very soft satin look it
doesn't matter phi2 much I don't know I
really really love it I have a mini
little version of the Laura Mercier
translucent powder I used to have the
big one but I gave it away to a friend
who really liked it so now I keep this
and honestly I never reach for this in
my opinion I have just found other those
powders that I like more it's just
sometimes it looks a little too heavy on
my dry skin I don't know it's not my
absolute favorite is still not it but
the RCM a no color powder is my favorite
loose powder of all time the only thing
that sucks is the packaging it's like
this it's in this original bottle like I
don't understand I keep my spices in
these kinds of bottles no offense to
this packaging it's just hard to use
sometimes you know besides the packaging
I think this powder is amazing truly
amazing it is undetectable on my skin I
can put this all over the place and it
just never looks heavy it doesn't look
like powder on the face it's so
incredibly silky is so smooth I love it
I love it I
and it's only like $12 it's so
affordable and you get like a million
pounds of product the RMS beauty
unpowered is really really amazing if
you want to blur the skin this is one of
those powders that's just like straight
silica like the makeup for everyone
their famous HD powder it's pretty much
the same these powders are incredible
they feel amazing on the scan they blur
the skin it kind of like fill in the
pores it just makes your skin look
porcelain silica tends to just like
bounce back and flash photography so I
only use this during the day when I'm
not taking photos and I love it I think
it just it smoothes out the skin so
nicely the NYC smooth skin loose face
powder in translucent is a powder I
think more people need to buy the
packaging sucks because like when you
open it powder flies everywhere it's
like not the best but the products
inside is so lovely I love this powder I
don't hear that many people talking
about it I actually think it's very
comparable to the Laura Mercier loose
powder in the sense where if I do use
too much it will look a little bit heavy
I think if you have oily skin you will
really like this powder especially if
you are looking for one at the drugstore
this was only a few dollars and you get
so much product and it mattifies the
skin really nicely and pulls my makeup
in place for a really long time the only
thing for me is that I can't use too
much because it will look a little cakey
but I love it and I use it all the time
it's really good and then the last loose
face powder I have is this one by Kosh
endo this is the natural lighting powder
you guys saw me test this out in a
recent first impressions video and I
didn't like it in that video or I didn't
like it immediately but the more I use
it the more I think I like it it has
like this bone color to it so it's not
completely transparent and I like that
because I don't feel like it makes my
foundation any lighter but if first
threw me off because it has these tiny
little specks of shimmer in it very tiny
very microscopic but it's all over the
place let me see if I can show you on my
skin can you tell when I move my hand
around there's like a soft luminous
Sheen to it it is so beautiful at first
I didn't like it I thought it was too
much but when you apply a light layer of
this it looks beautiful on top of really
matte foundations because it just gives
it a little bit of something I'm still
playing around with it I don't know
absolutely love it but so far I think I
really do like it okay so now I have
these powders these are mainly hourglass
powders those powders I go in kind of
like at the end of my makeup to give me
a light dusting to give my face a little
bit of a sheen the only one I don't keep
in here is the hourglass powder in
luminous light because to me that's a
highlight so I keep it with my
highlighters this is the ambient
lighting powder in radiant light to me
this is kind of like a bronzer almost
but not really I mean I only really use
this one in the summer when I'm a little
bit more tan because right now it's just
a little bit too pigmented to go all
over my entire face but I love dusting
this on my cheeks or all the places
where I bronzed it just gives my skin a
nice luminous glow I just love it I love
it especially in the summer time and
then I have this one in the shade EC
real light and this is what I use a lot
of the times to brighten my under eye
kind of in the same way I use the H&amp;amp;M
one but I use the H&amp;amp;M one whenever I
want a matte brightness to the under eye
but when I want a brightness that has a
little bit of a luminous sheen to it I
will always grab this powder it's so
little brightening but the sheen in it
is so beautiful especially if you're
extremely fair you might like this on
your entire face like if you're very
very very fair you might like this all
over the place to give your whole face a
nice glow but it's really subtle and
it's gorgeous
I love this one and then I have this one
which I created myself you can go on the
hourglass website and create a trio like
this with all the powders you like and I
have luminous light diffused light and
it's the real light I mix these two all
the time on my under eyes and then I'll
just use luminous light as a highlight
like I said so I love this little true I
take it with me to travel all the time
and I keep it in destroy next up we have
this ridiculously priced foundation
powder this is the cellular treatment
foundation and this is from the brand la
Prairie which is a really really pricey
brand I've purchased this because I saw
takis video when she used it and it
literally looked flawless on her face it
was kind of like magic immediately when
she applied it her skin looked
incredible it blew me away honestly so I
immediately wanted it and then I think I
saw Casey Holmes do a video on and she
loved it too so I just purchased it
thinking I was going to absolutely love
it but I kind of don't the magic it does
on them it doesn't really do it on my
skin I don't know
because I have a dress and I don't know
it just didn't well me it's a nice
powder don't get me wrong it's beautiful
but I don't think it's worth the money
that's really the problem they're so so
incredibly pricey that I don't think
it's worth it you can find a ton of
other powder foundations for a little
bit less or a lot less that can give you
a little more I think I don't know I
don't know that's just my opinion it
looks amazing on coffee and honestly I
could understand why she thinks it's
worth the money because it makes her
skin look awesome but for me it was like
an old K powder this is another powder I
use in the same way I use my hourglass
one this is the Laura Mercier candle
glow shear perfecting powder and this is
in the shade number one and it's exactly
what it says it's a sheer perfecting
powder this one has a little bit more
luminosity than the hourglass one like
this one is just slightly more
pearlescent but it's a similar vibe and
I use this one on my entire face like I
said it's a real light by hourglass is
just a little bit too light to put all
over my face I like dusting this one on
my face kind of like the same way I use
my Milani one but this one is just even
more glowing and then the left powder is
actually my newest one I just purchased
this off of the Make Up For Ever website
I went on their website to buy more of
their like ten metal pallets with my
eyeshadows in and then I stumbled across
this this is the Ultra HD powder it's
the same type of powder as I was
explaining before they're like famous
loose HD powder but now they came out
with a press version which I was really
excited about oh my god this feels
incredible this is like you know that
typical silica powder but it feels so
awesome on the skin these powders are
undeniably amazing just not in
photography but for like daily use I
mean it's incredible I love these kind
sodded I haven't used this one yet on my
face but I have used their HD powder in
the past and my opinion I prefer a
powder like this one that's what the
color of my skin it's just going to set
my face I'm not going to worry about it
in flash photography it's always going
to look good but sometimes these potted
a nice too so yes and yeah okay okay
guys so that completes this video these
were all of my powders and my opinions
and myself and then I have a little
request from you guys if you have dry
skin please leave me a comment down
below with your favorite powder
foundation from the drugstore I am on a
hunt but besides that leave me
comment down below what you want my next
makeup collection video to be about and
