probably the most requested video on my
channel and it is my makeup collection
and storage Porter and Selene are
fighting to be quite honest I didn't
want to post this video at all because
so much negativity surrounds these types
of videos like that's way too much
makeup you don't need that much makeup
so on and so forth which I absolutely
agree
before I started YouTube before I
started doing this you know YouTube
thing I would watch makeup collection
videos cuz I love them I love makeup
collection videos and I would watch them
and think like dang that girl has a lot
of makeup and I was always like shocked
at how much makeup people could have
like shocked and I thought I had never
had that much makeup and then Here I am
one of them I have done this video
before I did it over a year ago and I
had a basic good normal size collection
it was decent and you and I loved it it
was a great makeup collection but doing
this for a living or whatever I hate
calling this a job I do I know I I know
it is but I hate calling a job it's more
like my hobby doing this as my hobby and
you know I accumulate so much makeup I
buy so much makeup to review to test out
you know drugstore vs. high-end what's
worth it what's not
I am constantly buying makeup that I
know I don't need but I do to
incorporate it in my channel I don't
like using the same products in every
video I like to switch things up I know
that I don't need this much makeup but I
utilize 99.9 percent of it whenever I
don't want something or whenever I'm
like okay I haven't used this in four
months I give it away or I toss it I
toss the things that can't give away but
my sister gets stuff from me my friend
Gaby is constantly getting makeup from
me because you know I rotate it like hey
I haven't used this in a while here you
go have fun I give it a new owner I'm
not someone who has something sitting
there rotting for six months that's just
not who I am so that's why I didn't want
to pull
but I had tweeted about it and so many
of you were like no please a lot of us
won't care like the ones who really want
to see this won't leave negative
comments so this video is for you guys
who requested this and told me to post a
even though it gets a lot of heat so
this video is for you I'm gonna talk
about everything in my room I know I get
a lot of questions about certain
decorations I have my desk other things
I'm gonna talk about everything this
video is gonna be super lengthy I
already know it but without further ado
let's get on to it okay so this is
pretty much an overview of my desk and
usually have a chair right here but I
took it out to show you guys this desk I
get a lot of questions where I purchased
it and this was actually built by Danny
I drew on a piece of paper what I wanted
my desk
to look like and he brought it to life I
have three drawers right here and I keep
my stuff in here as well and then I
wanted a drawer on this side right here
and I wanted it to mimic the mom drawer
from Ikea so that comes out like this
and has like three slots just like the
mom drawer from Ikea okay so I took my
laptop out of the way just to show you
guys I'm gonna start zooming into
certain areas here on this side of the
desk you guys never see this side
because you normally see the other side
was where I foam and that's behind me
but here I keep my file derma this is
like my favorite thing to take off
makeup it's amazing and then I keep this
little thing right here that has my
cotton rounds a friend or viewer sent me
this this is a lipstick holder I got
from Sarah Beauty anything in this video
guys I will link it down below like
anything decoration wise or where I get
things I will definitely link everything
down below just so that this video is
actually helpful so I got this room's
army to come and it was pretty pricey it
was a pretty penny but I found that I
wasn't really using all my lipsticks
because they were just shoved in a
drawer somewhere so I wanted something
to kind of display them and I didn't
want to get just a bunch of little
lipstick holders I wanted something
compact that would hold a lot of
lipsticks so this holds like 70 or more
I think I'm not
be sure I keep like my pretty looking
ones on top I just like how it looks
with the gold and the rose gold in the
silver so these are from Torino
Tarantino these three are two-faced and
then these two are Charlotte Tilbury and
then in here and have Revlon I have
these this is Maricopa by beauty but
this is Rhett all Revlon I have
covergirl gorgeous cosmetics elf these
are all of my Maybelline lipsticks
Maybelline makes one of the best ones
out the drugstore in my opinion excuse
my nails they are terrible Maybelline
and then these are Make Up For Ever ones
these are all Milani right here and then
other random ones down here and then
these are all my NYX lipsticks I love
NYX these are our necks butter glosses
there are matte ones and their wicked
line so yeah those are the lipsticks I
keep in this little guy and I love it it
turns okay so now I'm moving towards
this side of the desk this is mainly
what you guys see in my videos because I
sit right here this I get a lot of
questions about it says follow that
dream and actually got this at Hobby
Lobby it was pretty cheap and I still
see it all the time when I go there's
but just check your local Hobby Lobby
they have them all the time this is just
a little like vase that I got from
Michaels and these are fake flowers I
got from Walmart this is a candle I
always always get questions about my
little owl like all the time and I got
this guy at Michael's um I haven't seen
it recently but just check Michaels they
have a lot of pretty ceramic owls this K
over here was just a cardboard kay I
bought at Michaels and then I glittered
Y spray painted it with glitter spray
paint and then back here these are all
candle jars so candle just like this
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I just clean it
out and turn it into lipstick holders
because I mean makeup brush holders
because clearly I have a lot of makeup
brushes so I just keep them all in
candle holders and then this guy I got
recently this is an original beauty box
from the original beauty box website I
will link it down below and I'm pretty
sure that I have a disc
code for you guys I pretty sure have a
coupon code so that you guys can get
some money off have you ever order from
that website so I will link all that
information down below but I love it
this mug actually I forgot to mention
that five seconds ago this month I got
from Anthropologie I will link it below
if they still have them they were
limited edition but I will link it below
and I keep all of my Real Techniques
brushes in here so these are their new
collection and then their original stuff
I just keep all my real techniques in
there because I think they're pretty
brushes so in this first drawer I really
don't keep anything but it's perfect for
lip liners and lip pencils eyeliners
this second drawer right here is kind of
ridiculous I have like a bunch of packs
of makeup remover wipes I'm addicted to
them so I have some here only
Hendrickson Mac and tart and then I keep
this amazing makeup forever palette here
this actually came out with the like 50
shades of grey collection but it is
beautiful I love it and then I have my
Mac pigments right here
I love the top here because I just
display things that I think are really
cute Too Faced is my all-time favorite
brand you guys know so I love their
packaging this is their limited edition
soulmates bronzer and I have it on
display because it's called Ross and
Rachel which friends is my favorite show
and I think the packaging is cute and
then I have another two-faced the blush
in peach Beach and I think it's pretty
to display this is an eyelash holder
from the boss a house of lashes carries
them too and then I have a cute little a
OS just sitting here because I like to
use them underneath lipsticks this right
here it just has a random stuff have
some color pop eyeshadows and elf
eyeshadow this is the color pop
Valentine's Day box and then this is the
color pop Shannon collab that they did
more eyeshadows here and then stuff that
I use pretty much on a daily basis over
here my first aid triple remedy can't
live without this stuff right now a
fresh sugar lip polish and then adds
your creme de Rose lip balm that I got
for my birthday which is really nice
thank you Sarah for buying this for my
birthday because does suspensive in this
drawer I
things that I really haven't been using
and I want to use them more I just
bought this melt dark matter stack
because I've heard everybody talking
about it so I purchased that having
using it this is the Stila mind pallet
then I had it for a while but I haven't
used it so I want to use it more this is
my favorite NARS duo and he's old laura

then in the last box here it's the
deepest I just keep this so late and a
Chanel a Laura Mercier primary my
hourglass ambient lighting palette NYX
angel veil because I really want to try
this out I haven't use this primer yet
and then I use these products all the
time
Mac emphasized and Mac cork for my brows
that's pretty much everything I keep in
this drawer it alternates though I put
stuff in there take stuff out it's
always changing and then this is the
drawer that is directly behind me when I
film and this is what it looks like
I haven't divided into three sections
these are bronzers blushes and
highlights and face powders so in the
bronzer drawer I just keep two of these
things that I got out by allegory comm
they have a ton of organizers for
everything this is their compact
organizer and I bought two and I store
my bronzers in here so I have two NARS
one is Palomino and one is Laguna I have
two Sonia Kashuk to Too Faced milk

Soleil and two from girl lactic Cabo and
Casablanca I have this one I got in my
boxycharm the Bahama Mama bronzer Dane
cosmetics Mac NYC a great dress for wine
I have the belly manager a great
contouring powder from L'Oreal and c8
and then I have the body shop honey
bronzer
alright here I keep like my golden need

I keep my bare minerals the beaches
waiting bronzer and my Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow and then back
here I have things that don't

my Tarte blush palette that came out
during the holidays these are all Mac
blushes these are the only blush blushes
I own from Mac but they're definitely
margin and then this is harmony this has
been a repurchase of mine for years I've
been using it since I was 15 because
it's the perfect blush and bronzer in
one and it's matte and then right here I
have MSF in cheeky bronze it's like a
highlighter but I use it for blush and

then in this thing right here this is
called the eye shadow hold it from by
allegory pretty sure it's that's what

dror okay so now I'm going to shift to
this side of the room which you guys
rarely ever see but I do keep a lot of
