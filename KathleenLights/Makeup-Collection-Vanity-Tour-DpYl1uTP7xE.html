highly highly requested video it's
probably my most requested video of all
time on my channel and it is my makeup
collection I am also going to be telling
you guys all about my vanity since I get
tons of questions about my vanity so
yeah this is a collab video with my
beautiful friend Belinda Selene here on
YouTube I'm obsessed with her I love her
so much she has helped me a lot since I
met her she has a lot more subscribers
than I do and she kind of is kind of
like a mentor I want to say like I
always go to her for advice she's really
cool about things and really helps me
out a lot so Thank You Belinda you're
the best so we decided I'm doing a
collab video but we didn't know what to
do and she thought about the amazing
idea to do a makeup collection collab so
after you watch my little makeup
collection here you can go ahead and go
watch hers hers is ten times more
amazing than mine I will link her
channel down below so you can go ahead
and watch that after you watch this one
hopefully or you can go watch hers now
that's fine too
really quickly though I do have to tell
you compared to a lot of these like big
Beauty vloggers here on YouTube my
makeup collection is like this yeah when
you watch it like these makeup
collections and it's just like drawers
and drawers and drawers of magic yeah
that's not going to happen here
compared to the average person who
doesn't do YouTube videos like I do I
probably have a lot of makeup but to to
some of you who are used to seeing the
really really big amazing makeup
collections you might be disappointed to
me enough I owe a lot to me I'm content
with my with my bunch like I said some
of you might think it's a lot or some of
you might be like mmm it's not what I
expected anyway I'm going to go ahead
and get on with the video because I know
you could more like okay stop talking
okay so this is the overview of my
vanity I would show you what's on that
side of the room but as you can start to
see right here it is an air mattress and
we have people visiting from a me so
that side of the room is a hot mess but
yeah this is the overview of the vanity
I always just keep my laptop right here
and then the little mirror that I use to
do all of my tutorials is right there
this chair I actually got from Bed Bath
and
and it was brown with a leather seat and
I've had it for years and years and
years and it kind of looked a little
dingy so I painted it and then just put
like a pink little fabric cover on top
of the leather seat this is about a
close-up of my mirror I get a lot of
questions about like where I got the
mirror and stuff and we actually got all
the parts for this desk from Lowe's oh I
don't know if I mentioned but my husband
actually built this desk I didn't get it
like at a store anything like that I
kind of drew on a piece of paper what I
wanted the desk to look like and he
brought it to life basically so I did
get this mirror at Lowe's or Home Depot
I think it was yeah Home Depot and then
I got all the parts right at Home Depot
as well these kind of just came together
in like a metal plate so we got two of
them and that and then he just put them
into the mirror and then I changed out
the light bulbs that it came with and
these are called like daylight light
bulbs I think that that's the only thing
that's that it says on the packet it's
just like daylight bulbs and it did come
in packs of two so I had to buy four
packs and yeah they just said daylight
bulbs on him because I didn't want
anything that gave off too much warmth
or made my skin look yellow so whenever
I do my tutorials where I'm facing the
mirror right here where you see the back
you see my wall these are the lights
that illuminate my face and then this is
the window I face whenever I'm doing my
videos when I'm not facing the light
bulbs I use natural light in my videos
and it's because I have this giant
window in front of me excuse this little
I kind of like twisted my curtain so
that more light can come in but yeah
this is what I face if you guys wanted
to know so right here is where I keep
the majority of my makeup this is just
one long drawer it is broken up into
three different compartments but they'll
open up at the exact same time okay so
this is a better view of the long drawer
I have right here I kind of have it
broken up into parts this section right
here is basically like all my primers
and my foundations even primers for the
eyes everything like base related is
right here then here are my blushes
bronzers and highlights and then here is
my lip drawer by the way guys my
organizing really sucks the more makeup
I get it's like harder for me to
organize things so basically things are
just kind of like thrown everywhere but
I'm working on my
organizing I'm gonna zoom into
everything specifically but back here is
where I keep all of my eyeshadow primers
and eyeshadow bases here I keep all of
my concealers and here I keep all of my
foundations and my face primers sorry if
the camera is a little shaky I'm going
to put it on the tripod in just a second
but here I keep my fixed plus and my
urban decay detail makeup setting spray
and then I keep some samples by here
that I get in the mail these are my
simple makeup remover wipes which by the
way have taken the place of my most
loved Burt's Bees wipes
I love these a lot more and then I just
keep my baby wipes back there cos this
desk can get a little surly to start
with this right here is where I keep my
Paint Pots and my color tattoos I have
Mac's rubenesque Paint Pot it's like
this beautiful gold I have my Maybelline
Color tattoo and barely branded the
pomegranate Punk Mac's painterly which
is like Holy Grail status Isis everyday

shocked that I only have three color
tattoos because they are amazing they're
just as good as the Mac Paint Pots I

primer potion that came with the Naked 3

one of my favorites and then I have a
bunch of jumbo pencils some from Jordana
and some from NYX these two aren't jumbo
pencils I kind of use them for my
waterline or underneath my brow bone
they're just like little highlights from
cella
and from Anastasia but yeah I use these
as eyeshadow bases so my concealers
these are the only concealers I own I
don't own very many because I rotate
them and if I don't like them I throw
them away I don't like to hang onto
makeup I don't use so I have my
Maybelline age rewind I have my little

my favorite drawer because I'm obsessed
with bronzers and highlighters this is
