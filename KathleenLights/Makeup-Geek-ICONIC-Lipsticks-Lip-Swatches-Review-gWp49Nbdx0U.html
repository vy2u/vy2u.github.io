a lip swatch video on the new makeup
geek iconic lipsticks which is why my
lips look like this and just watch 20
lipsticks and it's a little painful I
feel a little bit wrong
so before I go into the review portion
of this video I will show you all the
lipsticks swatched on my lips so we can
get to that first because I know that's
what you guys really want to see but I
just want to update you guys first
really quick so make a peak recently
launched 20 new lipsticks they are
called the iconic lipstick and she did
send these to me in this cute little box
which I'm pretty sure this box is for
sale but I'm but I think it's sold out
currently but it is really cute it's
just like a cardboard little box that
has all the slots for the 20 lipsticks
this wouldn't fit like a regular
lipstick because her lipsticks are like
in this skinny sleek long tube it could
also be used for eyeliners lip liners
the box sells for $13 but the lipsticks
themselves you know they are also sold
individually these lipsticks retail for
$15 each and the lipsticks come in two
different formulas they come in a matte
finish and in a shine finish she also
released more lip products if you want
to see lip swatches on these as well let
me know these are the new plush creams
and plush matte lips anyway I will go
into detail right after these lip
swatches quick little warning quick
little warning most of the time with a
darker lipstick I will apply a lip liner
underneath that was in the case for this
video I wanted to get through the
lipsticks as fast as I could so I didn't
use a lip liner with any of them so the
lip swatches are a little bit messy I'm
sorry it just it gets messy so please
forgive me let's look past that but yeah
let's jump into the lip swatches and
then I will tell you what I think
and
yeah
okay so those were 20 iconic lipsticks
swatched on my lips
like I said they retail for $15 and I
really like these some I like more than
others I have worn two shades already I
wore one earlier today for a few hours
and then I wore one yesterday which one
did I win oh yes this one I wore naive
earlier today it's very very pale but I
wore it with a lip liner underneath and
I really liked it it's one of the shine
finishes and then I wore this one
yesterday and I love it what is it worth
this one this is in the shade lively I
wore it all day yesterday and it lasted
a really good time I will say the mattes
last longer than the shine ones that's
to be expected usually a matte finish
lasts a little bit longer I do really
like these lipsticks I like that the
matte ones are very matte but I wouldn't
say it's a very drying matte I guess it
depends on your preference or what you
consider to be drying for me personally
I found them to be pretty comfortable
this one in lively like I said I wore it
and it was like so beautiful for so many
hours I thought I would like the matte
ones more than the shine ones but
surprisingly I like the shine ones a lot
too some colors I honestly won't wear
that much because for me when I wear a
really dark color on my lips I like it
to be matte that way it's just less
messy and it doesn't slip and slide
everywhere and I'm just not it not
careful enough for that I prefer my
darker colors to be matte I love the
dark shades I love the light shades too
I do wish that they would have more
variety in like the nude category I wish
she would come out with more nudes and
love nude lipstick and I was a little
disappointed that there wasn't like nude
colors but that's just me and everybody
has nudes I guess I love this packaging
I love this gunmetal sleek look and I
also really like that it gives you a
little bit of color indication right
here at the top it shows you what the
lipstick color is gonna be but I
personally wouldn't go by that because
as you saw in the lip swatches some of
these don't really match the color
inside like this one for example in Savi
you look at it you're like wow that's
gonna be such a pretty like light
greyish purple and then you open in your
light or light does like a really
different which is okay it doesn't
bother me I'm just letting you know
don't go by like the little circle on
the top because you might be a little
bit confused but besides that I really
love the packaging the only thing I
do not like is that it doesn't tell you
the finish of the lipstick on the bottom
some of these are a shine finish and
some of these are a matte finish and it
doesn't tell you at all it just says
like for example this one is called
candid and it just says iconic lipsticks
when it's called gullible and just as
iconic lipstick like it doesn't say what
finish it is probably not a big deal to
some people I mean it's not a big deal
at all but I wish that it had that I
thought these were really great across
the board in terms of pigmentation some
of these or a little bit patchy going on
only a couple though I really only
noticed that with like the grayer tones
in the collection this shade rare
specifically was a little bit patchy
going on but once you apply like two or
three layers it gives you full opacity
there isn't any patchiness but you do
have to work with a little bit and the
same with the shade offbeat aside from
those things I mentioned I really really
like these I only wore naive for like
three hours earlier today so I can't
tell you if it's super long wearing if
the shiny ones are very long wearing I
did notice it fading a little bit but
the matte shade I wore yesterday wore
for a really long time I love the matte
finish it goes on so smooth it doesn't
dry out my lips personally I and I just
love matte lipstick but this one
actually forgot to mention in the shade
quirky stunning stunning orange shade
but it did emphasize the dryness of my
lips a little bit this orange one but
you had to get really really close to
notice that I'm just trying to nitpick
at every little thing to give you guys
like a lot of detail but besides that
all the mats are amazing I will say I do
really like the shine ones too by the
way I don't know which ones I like more
because the shiny ones are so pigmented
and they make your lips look so glossy
and juicy I don't know I really really
like the shine ones too I can't pick
which one I like more I would totally
recommend these if you are looking for
either a matte or a shiny lipstick if
you're looking for like a satin finish
or like a cream finish you probably
won't like these these are either met or
have a shine to them so yeah my overall
thoughts on this is that they're really
really good I would give it a solid B I
wouldn't give it an A yet because I need
to play around with them more but these
iconic lipsticks are really good let me
know if you've picked any up if you want
to pick some up what do you think of
them so yeah that completes this video
I'm gonna go put on like a lot of
aquaphor on my lips and then go to bed
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
video thank you so much for watching

go ahead and up
