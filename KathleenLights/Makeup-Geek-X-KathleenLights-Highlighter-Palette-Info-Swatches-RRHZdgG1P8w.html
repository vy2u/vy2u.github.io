exciting one I'm gonna be sharing my
makeup geek highlighting palette with
you guys I'm gonna give you details
everything about the palette that
launches to day as you are watching this
this video is pre-recorded but as you're
watching this right now I mean if you
are watching it when I post it it is now
available I will have the link down
below I just wanted to quickly start off
with that just in case you guys don't
follow me on any social media and you're
wondering about the launch date it is
now today I'm gonna be sharing it with
you guys and we're gonna chat about it
so for those who don't know makeup geek
Marlena if you follow Marlena on YouTube
she has her own brand called makeup geek
which I'm sure all of you guys know but
makeup geek asked me to collab with them
on a highlighter palette and it is
finally here and I'm so excited to share
it with you today today what I'm filming
this it is Saturday on the 13th but you
won't be watching this till August 17th
and I'm recording this video because I'm
leaving to LA so I'm pre recording a
couple of videos so unfortunately I have
a couple of missing pieces in this video
I have the palette with me but it's
completely blank on the back the regular
palette like once it goes for sale it
will have the names on the back of the
palette but unfortunately mine doesn't
and it wasn't gonna get here in time
before I left so this is what we're
working with also I don't have the box
to show you guys which I'm so sad about
because the box is so cute I will put up
a picture here if I can even though I
don't have like an actual picture of the
box maybe I can go back in my text
messages and see if I can pull up
something but the outside box is so cute
and like foiled and so pretty I love it
but I really wanted to get this video up
today because today is when it launches
but don't worry because once I get the
box and once I get the palette with
things on the back I will share them
with you guys whether it's on social
media or here on YouTube but you can
definitely keep up with me on snapchat
Twitter and Instagram that's mainly
where I post all the information about
Michael abs and my launches so I'm sorry
that this video isn't 100% planned
professionally but it's me so and also
there was a couple of questions I got
that I wanted to answer in this video
before you guys placed an order so that
you guys knew the information before you
purchased it you know what I'm saying
okay so anyway Marlina asked me to
create a
lighter palette I was so excited cuz I
had no idea she was even coming out with
highlights and she's coming out with a
ton of different shades not only just
this palette she's coming out with like
a ton of singles so this is what the
palette looks like it's really really
thin really sleek so easy to travel with
I really like the packaging it's not
bulky and it has like the magnetic
closure really similar to the mani
palette if you guys purchased Manny's
eyeshadow palette in collaboration with
makeup geek it's similar packaging this
is the packaging that she really likes
to do her company and I totally agree
with it I love it I love this art deco
pattern makeup geek is very like modern
with like an art deco twists and I had
so much fun in the photo shoot they did
like a whole old like Victorian kind of
photo shoot with me it was kind of
nerve-wracking because I really don't
like photo shoots at all they're so
scary but it was so much fun
and I just really loved the people
behind makeup geek I think they're a
really great company because of the
people that they are I have been
watching Marlena on YouTube since she
was filming on her webcam I was in high
school and Marlena was one of the first
Beauty vloggers I watched like I think
she was the first I'm pretty sure like I
googled a Naked palette makeup tutorial
she popped up and then I subscribed her
and it's almost unbelievable to see me
working with her it's life is weird man
life's weird I'm drinking kombucha
kombucha have you guys ever tried this
supposedly really really great for you a
little strong though a little strong
okay so enough of my yapping I'm sorry
so this is what the palette looks on the
inside and it just comes with three
highlights these pens are very very big
let me show you
Oh compare slam so this is what I would
say a typical highlight looks like like
Mac I don't know I feel like they're
usually this sized
and this is a comparison to the size so
they're pretty big highlights are on the
same size as this only they're square
and you get a lot of product in this not
exactly sure what the grams are or what
but I think Marlena went into detail in
her video or is gonna go into detail in
her video since I'm pre recording this
know when her video will go up these are
the colors I came up with a I had a lot
of questions about the formula though
since Marlena has never launched a
highlight I got so many questions of
what to expect of the formula and I got
so many people thinking I created the
formula and I just wanted to clear that
for a second I helped create the colors
I didn't help create the formula this is
marlenas formula 100% and if you are
curious so you have a reference it's
based off of her foiled shadow formula I
didn't create the formula that would
have been cool but that's like a whole
other ballgame that's like my own makeup
line maybe someday so these are the
three colors I came up with this one is
kind of like a soft gold not a white
gold or anything it's up it's very much
a gold but it's not like a yellow gold
it's a really nice soft gold this is a
pinky pearly champagne finish but
definitely with a pink undertone and
then this one is more of a bronze gold I
got so many questions about these colors
why I chose these colors and I really
take my subscribers and what they say
into consideration I've been doing
YouTube since 2013 and I always hear my
subscribers that have a deeper skin tone
say that they can never find highlights
that work for them everything always
looks too ashy like I always get that
from subscribers with a deep skin tone
so I know that I wanted to create a
color that was good for deep skin tones
and that's why I created this one I got
so many people like oh my gosh that
colors too dark why would you create a
color like that but light skin is not
the only skin color in the world you
know just because I have like fair skin
doesn't mean that I'm only going to
create a color that's gonna work for me
now I know that a lot of you guys looked
at this and those of you with like
porcelain skin tones we're like oh those
colors are too dark I would never wear
that and I understand these two colors
work perfectly fine on my skin tone
they're not too dark and there's
actually a friend of mine who works for
makeup geek who uses the pink color all
the time and she is very very fair and
she says she loves it that it looks
great on her it doesn't look too dark so
this one could be very versatile if you
pack it on a lot than yeah you can kind
of see a pink a strong pink undertone
but just dusting this on the tops of the
cheekbones you
more of a shine more of like a
reflective look than you do pink and
then this gold one at the top is just
like a beautiful soft gold color I think
it would work for a lot of different
skin tones because it's pretty much gold
and I feel like gold highlights look so
good on so many people and another thing
a lot of people were concerned about is
that they were surprised there wasn't
like a white shade in the palette
because you guys know my favorite colors
to highlight with on my face or like the
pearl white shades but when I was
creating this palette I literally asked
everyone in my life and I asked so many
people like what's your favorite color
to highlight with and no one told me
like a pearly white everyone was like
gold gold champagne gold gold it was
always gold so I didn't want to be
selfish and create like a white pearly
shade that no one was gonna like and
then I knew for a fact that I wanted a
pink I loved pinky highlights maybe that
part of me was a little selfish I don't
know if everyone loves the pinky tone
highlights but I love them I'm gonna
haven't even told you the names of that
okay so I'm gonna tell you a little bit
of a backstory I know that this video is
long but I just want it to be like a
nice chatty video and I will have
annotations down below if you want to
see specific things in the video so
originally when I came up with the
colors and the idea of this palette a
while back the name of the palette was
actually going to be called light of the
party or something along those lines and
then tart released something that had
almost the exact same name and I was
like ah de neat I had to change the name
so now it's just like the kathleenlights
highlighter palette which I actually
like now I feel like it's more personal
and I had completely different names for
these highlights and then once we change
the name of the palette I thought it
would be really cool to end the names of
the colors in light I know that's really
cheesy and really corny but as my friend
iris would say I like corny that's from
the movie the holiday I realized
probably nobody would have gotten that
but that's from the holiday so I know
that naming is really corny but I
thought it was a fun play on words
because I am kathleenlights and this is
a highlighter palette so I thought I was
cute and this gold one is named
nightlight this pink one is called
starlight and this bronzy gold one is
called sunlight and I got a couple of
people asking me if I copy the name
starlight from the lorac highlight
and to be honest I already mentioned
this on snapchat but I wasn't even
thinking of the lorac highlights when I
was naming these I didn't copy the name
starlight it's just what I thought of
when I saw this little pinky color I
have three different highlights from
three different brands named moonstone
like it happens guys
and another thing quickly before I show
you guys swatches and what it looks like
there was a lot of people concerned
about the price this retails for $39 and
I hear you guys like trust me I am a
youtuber before I am anything else I
don't care what anybody things like I
hear you I understand that this is a
pricy highlight palette when there are
other highlight palettes out on the
market right now that are around the
same price and you get more of them I
completely understand where you're
coming from like I am a makeup buyer as
well like I'm just like you guys buying
things online and just being addicted to
make it forever as a youtuber I was
somebody who watched youtubers for those
of you who don't want to purchase it I
completely understand this is the only
price it could be and she went into
detail in her video as to why it is that
price but this is what it is and I'm
sorry you guys are disappointed in that
I love you guys no matter what you know
that so let me show you guys swatches of
the palette I'm going to swatch them on
my hand and then I'm going to apply like
a couple of them to my face this first
one is called night light like I said
and it's just a really pretty soft gold
please I will say swatch a little bit
darker and a little bit more intense on
the skin and they do on the face you
know some highlights you just got to see
it on the skin like on your face to get
the real these highlights are like that
because they look dark when you swatch
them like oh my gosh it's going to be
too dark for me but when you apply them
to the tops of your cheekbones you get
more of a pearly reflective finish but
nine light is just a really beautiful
soft gold and it really looks nice when
your face hits the light like you can
see the nice beaming gold so pretty but
so soft at the same time I would say
that night light is the most wearable
even if you don't like gold it's not a
super intense gold color and then this
one in the middle is called starlight
probably my favorite one swatch on the
hand it looks super pink I was really
worried that it was going to be too pink
but on the cheeks it's exactly how I
pictured it I would really recommend
you going in with a light hand with
starlight because it is in boots but the
great thing about these highlights is
that they're very very multiple you can
do like one layer and it looks very
suitable for daytime but if you put on
like two or three layers of this you get
a really intense highlight and then the
last shade which is sunlight is such a
pretty bronzy color this one is too dark
for my skin tone no matter how light of
a hand I use and one of my friends from
makeup geek told me that they tried it
on women in the office that have like a
deep skin tone and that it looks really
beautiful
and I also love to use this one as an
eye shadow this is what I have all over
my lid today it looks really dark but
only because I applied a really dark
brown eyeshadow base underneath it was
like a matte chocolate color and then I
went over top of it with the bronze
shade so that's why it looks kind of
like a dark bronzy color but I love
using this one as an eye shadow so these
are the three colors and I'm going to
show you really quickly what they look
like on the tops of the cheekbones
because in the pants they do look pretty
dark I'm going to show you starlight
here in the middle man I use the Wayne
Goss number fourteen brush and I'm just
going to lightly dust this on the tops
of my cheekbones whenever I want like
just a soft highlight with this color I
will use a brush like this that's bigger
and fluffier and it just looks like so
subtle subtle
that I say settle and now I'm going to
go in with my Real Techniques setting
brush and just apply a little more so
this is what the pinky one looks like
you can see it's not such a strong pink
undertone and then just so you can see
this one a little bit on top this is my
favorite way to wear these highlights
honestly every time I use this palette I
never go in with one individually I
always mix the first two and that's how
I go in with my highlight so I'm just
going to add a night light on top of
starlight
then I'm going to take some of
nightlight on my nose and on my nose
again
so this is what both of those highlights
look like layered on top of each other I
will say because I got a lot a lot of
questions and I know it's difficult for
you guys to make your decision because
you've never tried a makeup cake
highlight before but this is like I said
earlier based on her foiled formula so
it's a very soild finish once you like
layer the colors on at night time like
in photos it's like bean but I will say
this is the type of highlight if you are
someone who suffers from really bad
texture on your face or on your skin you
will see it underneath this highlight I
mean I know that highlights emphasize
the skin because it's a highlight so all
highlights pretty much emphasize just be
weary of that I definitely wanted to
mention that so I think that's pretty
much it I cover the price of formula the
colors and oh I will say this is limited
edition I can't believe I forgot to say
that this is limited edition it's not
like other things in the past
that kind of linger there for a while no
once these are sold out they are sold
out there is enough if you want it so
don't worry about that but it is limited
edition like seriously so just keep that
in mind but I think I covered everything
thank you guys so so much for making my
dreams a reality for being my best
friends my support system without you

wise but like I feel in my soul like I
