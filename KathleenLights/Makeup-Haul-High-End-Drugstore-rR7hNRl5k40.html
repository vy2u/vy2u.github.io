little bit of a chatty one I know my
last video was as well but so is this
one and I just wanted to sit down and
share with you guys some makeup I
recently bought I picked up a couple of
drugstore stuff from Ulta and then a
couple of things from Sephora and then
some miscellaneous things from other
websites it's honestly mostly lip
products you would think with the
hundreds of lipsticks that I already own
that I would just just stop buying more
but makeup is an addiction and we can't
sell I wanted to pick up some new fall
lip colors that weren't just like with
lipstick so I got a couple of those in
here I wanted to film this video because
I'm taking a mental health week from
YouTube
today is Tuesday I'm not exactly sure
when this video is going up but I did
pre record video so don't worry I'm
taking a mental health week but I'm
still posting videos I pre recorded a
few videos like back-to-back just so
that I can have a full week of cleaning
my garage mostly because I really need
to do that but also to just recollect
and see if I can find some inspiration I
have just I keep saying it but I've been
feeling kind of bummed and I feel like
the creative juices aren't really
flowing and I know I promised you guys
so many videos and I haven't been able
to do them and I really apologize for
that I hate making promises and not
following through with them and I did
promise a room tour that should be
coming soon my mom is actually going to
help me organize this room a bit before
I film that video and also the video
that I promised about the drugstore
battle of the foundation sticks and the
bottle of the high-end foundation sticks
those videos are still coming it's just
I want to use the foundations thoroughly
before I film that video just to give
you guys like an actual review and since
there's a ton of foundation it's taking
a while but besides that I hope you guys
are having an amazing week I hope your
October is amazing with great
opportunities and a lot of happiness
sometimes life can get pretty shitty and
we just have to try to focus on the good
even though it's really hard so I
decided to sit down film this casual
video before I took the week to read a
bunch of self-help books and I'm just
gonna get started because this intro was
like five minutes long
okay so I'm gonna start off with the
things I got at Sephora when I saw this
on the website I nearly peed my pants
look how beautiful this Z palette is it
is probably the most stunning Z palette
ever it's a little bit thicker it's like
their classics - for our Z palettes this
one is exactly like that only it's gold
with this amazing glitter and look at
this the glitter is on the inside that
is stunning
I love these specific Z palettes the
ones by Sephora because if you happen to
have those like domed baked powders or
eyeshadows or blushes sometimes they
don't fit in a regular Z palette the
fact that these are a little bit bigger
fits those products better and I I just
love it I think it's so festive for the
holiday season and it would look so
beautiful filled with like really warm
gold tone eyeshadows you know what I
might just put all my gold toned shadows
in this cuz it's so pretty
yeah I think I'm gonna do that I really
think I'm gonna do that okay so the
other thing I got it Sephora I don't
know if you guys have noticed but
Sephora is full of holiday releases now
so many new holiday collections and like
sets I've already purchased like ten
gifts for my friends on the sephora
website because they're new like holiday
collections are so cool and so nice from
so many different brands so if you have
a beauty lover in your life definitely
go to Sephora they have awesome holiday
kits I picked up this for myself this
isn't exactly a holiday kit but I wanted
it anyway this is the Too Faced and
Beauty Blender collab it comes with a
blotter ozzie by Beauty Blender which I
hear really bad things about this and
then it comes with a mini Too Faced
candlelight glow highlighting powder duo
which I already have this but honestly I
bought the entire kit just for the pink
Beauty Blender because it's a baby pink
color it's not like your typical pink
and I don't think beauty blender has
ever come out with a baby pink sponge I
have a baby pink one from the brand
mascara but I'm excited actually now
that I take it out of the box
it almost looks white am I crazy or does
that look not as baby pink as I thought
it was gonna be anyway so it comes with
a Beauty Blender which I love the Beauty
Blender so that was awesome and then it
comes
with his bladder ozzie which i've never
tried before my friend Melissa just got
here so I'm probably not gonna use this
Melissa do you want this cuz I'm
primary's supposedly you like you know
you wanna hear you know merit and then
it comes with this little candlelight
glow powder dual which I already have
and I love this highlight you want this
too I already have this it's like a
little highlight I bought this whole kit
for the beautiful is pink okay so the
next thing I bought at Sephora was this
little nail polish duo from Deborah
Lippmann that I love it instantly
reminded me of Cinderella so I knew I
had to have it I actually bought like
two of these to give out as gifts for
Christmas it's like a little pink and
then the shimmery got top coat I love
this so much I cannot wait to try on the
back of the box it shows you like a
picture of the pink and then the glitter
and then the pink on top of the glitter
I cannot wait it's like a winter
wonderland and the packaging is so cute
look at I don't know if they can see it
on camera but it has like a snow globe
effect I love it so much I bought a new
foundation I'm not exactly sure if this
is new or not I don't know if I don't
remember if I saw it on the just arrived
section but I've never seen it before
and it's from the brand ardency Inn
I thought they had taken it off of
Sephora but apparently ardency Inn is
back at Sephora and this is their
America custom coverage constant rates
and I thought the packaging was kind of
cool this is what it looks like it has a
pump it's a very messy pump I've only
used it once and it's like destroyed
already this is the foundation I have on
my face right now and I'm not exactly
sure if I love it yet I do like it it is
a little bit too dark for me this is in
the shade medium golden I don't know and
what universe I thought I was medium
golden but I applied it today with my
torch brush that I need to wash it's
like the big fat kabuki and I really
like the effect it gave my skin but it's
not full coverage by the name of the
foundation you would think it is it's
custom coverage concentrate like a very
concentrated covered but on me it's like
a medium coverage you can still kind of
see like my skin insurance through my
foundation it didn't really cover all of
them but it's
a really nice job of covering most of it
so I would say it's a decent medium
coverage you could probably build it up
I was afraid to build it up because it
is a very thick foundation but it's so
weird because blending it out it's not a
cakey foundation it's just really thick
so I'm still gonna play around with this
a little bit more and then I will get
back to you guys it feels like nothing
it's like weightless but I mean so
pretty penny
okay so underneath my foundation I have
this on and I'm so excited for this this
is the LC pearl radiance primer I didn't
buy this at Sephora I bought this off of
the LC website I heard Jacqueline Hill
raving about this primer so I went out
and bought it and I was so funny I had
text her and I was like thank you for
saving me $3 cuz I used to a 10% off
code and this is what it looks like it's
the most beautiful bottle ever I tried
on today for the first time and I really
did like it there's a little bit of
shimmer in this but you can only see it
if you're looking really really close to
your face but besides that it is very
moisturizing and there is definitely a
glow to the face so I really like that I
have to test it out a little bit more
but I love the bugger doing I love the
pump and so far so good
shake well before use oh I didn't do
that okay so I got this from Ulta I've
heard so many people raving about the
essence lash princess mascara and I
could have sworn I had this but couldn't
find it anywhere so I'm not exactly sure
so this is just their best seller duo it
has their original lash princess and
then their lash princess false lashes
I'm wearing this one on my eyes today
and I really really like it it's really
volumizing I like the wand on the
regular lash princess but I like the
formula of this one I don't know I like
them both they're really good one is
just a little bit more volumizing and
this was like dirt cheap
essence is such a cheap brand and
they're so good and then the rest of the
stuff I got is complete at all lip
products I love it
I have a bunch of lip products
just that time of year you know these
three I am the most excited about I had
never ever heard of this brand this is
the brand black up and I purchased these
off of the Sephora website and these are
kind of like jumbo sticks Oh kind of
like the NARS satin or matte lip pencils
that come in this little chubby stick
only I think I might like the formula on
these better I've only tried one which
is this one which is the one I'm wearing
on my lips black up matte jumbo lip
pencil and this is in the shade jung-jae
um you Joe then there's a line and it
says 22m next to the word jump so I mean
I don't know anyway this is the color on
my lips today
I love the formula of these they do
transfer they're not like liquid
lipsticks at all but they have a matte
finish they're so easy to work with and
look at this it's like like I don't know
it's like the most pigmented smooth
creamy lipstick ever it is a little bit
difficult to work with just because it
is a chubby little stick there's not a
really fine point so I just applied all
over my lips and then I kind of
perfected the edges with a lip brush and
I love it formula is so on point it is
very creamy at first but then it starts
to settle down to a very matte finish
but I mean it still transfers a bit but
not too much I love love love these I
definitely recommend black up chubby
little jumbo crayons cuz they're so good
and then I got two more colors this one
is probably my favorite but I got two
more shades this one is a little bit
more nude oh no just kidding it's not
like a rosy color and this oh okay okay
they all say jump on them they all say
about oh this one is in the shade 22m
the one I'm wearing on my lips this one
right here is in the shade 21m and then
this other one I bought is in the shade
23 and
this one's more of like that chocolatey
deep color these colors are beautiful
for the fall which is why I purchased
them I cannot wait to dive into all the
deep chocolate browns and put them all
over my lips so yes highly recommend
these if you're at Sephora look for them
I bought two lipsticks from Kat Von D I
got these at Sephora I just got these
because they were in this cool limited
edition packaging I've never been a huge
fan of the Kat Von D studded kiss
lipsticks to be completely honest but
then these were like limits and
positions so beautiful they're so
beautiful and what I really like about
these is that they are classic cold
colors that she already has in her
liquid lipstick line so this is Lolita 2
which is my favorite out of the two I
love the latitude but I got that one and
then I got the shade mother which is a
really really beautiful berry toned
this is going to look so so beautiful
this time of year I cannot wait to try
these I love this packaging
I bought three lip products from the
brand coloured raine I already have
sugar liquid lipstick and Mars and I'm
pretty sure marshmallow and I have
another one from color green I'm not I
don't remember but I saw these two and I
knew I had to have them I don't know why
this one is in like special packaging it
has like pink on it I don't know why cuz
they're both label lipsticks but this
one is in the shade suede kind of
similar to what I'm wearing on my lips
right now but more yellow toned
I feel like more gray toned I love
colors like this I thought this would be
a nice little addition to my liquid
lipsticks because I don't have a color
that's identical to this I feel like
this is a very very unique liquid
lipstick and so is this one this one is
so pretty I think this is going to be so
nice for Christmas or like Thanksgiving
Christmas Eve it's like a really pretty
shimmery burgundy I love it it's called
Fame and it looked so nice on the lips
on the website that I just had to buy it
so so glad I did and
I got this lipgloss I purchased this
because of nikkietutorials she had a
picture on Instagram where she had a
NARS lip stick and then this lip gloss
on top funny thing I bought the NARS lip
stick I get purchased it from Sephora
and then when I got it in the mail turns
out it was a dior eyelash primer I plan
artistic and they sent me a D or primer
my receipt said NARS lipstick and
everything and what I what was in the
box was a Dior primer so I have to go to
Sephora and return the primer anyway she
was wearing this lip gloss on top of the
NARS lipstick and it looked so beautiful
it looked like the perfect nude lip this
is the lip gloss in the shade butter
love and they are very very pigmented
lip glosses I feel like a regular
lipstick that has a glossy finish I know
right it looks kind of like a lipstick
yes is this Olympics no it is it is it
was it was calm the wet sure don't
confuse me let me check well here's
another lip gloss if it is not very
shiny lip gloss yes color rain butter
love lip gloss okay so it is a lip gloss
that has not as much shine as your
typical lip gloss kind of like the
Anastacio one only less glossy less
thick it's like a liquefied version of a
lipstick with a little bit of shine
right I don't know it feels really nice
it feels like it has a good formula so
maybe it'll just look like a shiny
lipstick I don't freaking know but
nikkietutorials was wearing it and she
looked freaking amazing so I bought it
speaking of lip glosses I bought more
lip glosses about this one on Ulta and
then about this one on Ulta this is the
essence XXL shine lip gloss this was
like two dollars and it reminded me so
much of Versailles I think from Oprah
cosmetics only that's a liquid lipstick
and this is a lip gloss but still it is
the most perfect metallic nude color I
love metallic lip glosses and this would
just look so pretty on top of any in red
its yeah this does look like a lip gloss
I love it I've already worn this on my
lips once and I
they I put it on top of like a really
light nude and it just looked it looked
so nice and it smells really good it
sounds like strawberry and then this
lipgloss is from it cosmetics and it is
their vitality lip flush I have never
seen this before I was just like
browsing Ulta and they noticed it and I
was like ah that looks like a really
pretty color this one is definitely like
a glossy glossy lip gloss like there's a
lot of gloss to that but it doesn't feel
really thick and it's pigmented enough I
have a feeling that I'm really really
gonna like this this seems like one of
those lip glosses that work really well
on its own or on top of a lipstick this
is in the shade perfect nude and I feel
like it is perfect nude right perfect
name okay we are almost done guys I am
so sorry the rest of these are all
really really affordable if you guys
have not tried the essence lipsticks you
need to really really creamy really good
this one is in the shade natural beauty
it's just like a really pretty everyday
pink they're very creamy and they're not
drying at all they're so hydrating and
comfortable but surprisingly they last a
really long time on my lips I don't feel
the need to over apply I just I love the
essence lipsticks so underrated I don't
hear anyone talking about them and then
the same goes for Catrice these
lipsticks feel really pricey like
there's a lot of weight to that the
essence ones like you can tell you know
like they're a little bit sheep-like in
terms of packaging you know they feel
light but these actually have some
weight to them they feel nice and heavy
and they're around the same price point
probably a little bit more pricey but
still extremely affordable and I got two
colors these are their ultimate color
lipsticks this is in the shade nude
tastic which is just a really really
pretty nude color I know I love colors
like this I mean these are my favorite
types of nudes it doesn't have too much
pink it's not too much Brown you know
what I mean it's like somewhere in
between it's perfect
alone and then the other color I got is
the shade maroon and it's just a really
really pretty maroon type of brown I
love this color
so pretty these are very very creamy
they're not matte lip whatsoever they're
kind of like the cream Sheen's from Mac
only you
even more creamy they're really good I
mean I haven't tried it on my lips but
they feel really good
