a talk through makeup look on this look
right here and I'm basically showing you
my favorite like bulletproof makeup
makeup that lasts all day on my face if
I want to go somewhere and I know I'm
gonna be out all night I'll usually use
these products and just change them up
it's our formulas that work really
really well for staying in place for a
long time
at least on my skin I'm also going to be
giving you a few like tips and tricks on
how to like apply things and make them
last longer and all that stuff so you
guys know that I'm always very very open
very very honest on my channel and this
video is sponsored by skin de Naevia if
you guys are not into sponsor videos
which I completely 100% understand then
stay tuned for my next video that won't
be sponsored because this one might not
be for you I will be using other brands
in this video besides Scandinavia but
this video is partnered with them and I
was very very excited because I love
Scandinavia since I started YouTube so
yeah I'm mainly going to be talking
about these two products from
Scandinavia these are the sprays this is
the primer spray and the makeup
finishing spray I'm sure you guys have
heard of Scandinavia because a lot of
people use them as makeup finishers and
they really make your makeup last all
day this is actually one that I
purchased myself this one was sent by
Scandinavia but this one I purchased
myself when if you guys saw my IMATS
haul like my old IMATS haul
I bought it while I was at IMATS and I
take this with me every single time I
travel you guys don't see me use this on
my channel at all but every time I go to
Miami or California this bad boy comes
with me because it works and honestly
when I do tutorials on my channel I'm
usually just home and I'll wear that
makeup for the rest of the day but I
don't really need it to last all day
because 9 times out of 10 I stay home
I don't do anything ever um so I don't
really show you guys me putting on like
finishing sprays cuz I even spray like
setting sprays when I'm done with my
makeup but I never do it in my videos
because I just don't
about it so actually the story behind
Scandinavia is really really cool the
founder of Scandinavia actually came up
with the idea to make these products
isn't fairly new but came up with the
idea to make like a finishing spray when
he was in Miami like nightclubs in Miami
and I live in Miami I'm from Miami
so it it's kind of funny to hear that
story because he noticed that girls
makeup like I in the nightclub like at
the end of the night their makeup look
like it was kind of like melting off
like just sweating off which is
understandable it's a nightclub I get
sweaty in there I hear I've actually
never been to a club
sidenote never ever been to a club in my
life and I'm 23 anyway so he would go to
Miami nightclubs and he would notice
that makeup on women was not really
lasting and it was just melting off so
he thought of the idea to create his own
line of makeup finishing sprays and you
guys know people swear by Scandinavia
and they're actually a very very good
brand Scandinavia actually uses like
temperature control technology I don't
know how they do but they do which makes
your makeup last all day and heat or
humidity cuz it's just it's just made to
control the oils that shine through the
primer I'm not going to lie this is best
for normal to oily skin normal
combination to oily skin I have dry skin
and I still use this but I only use this
when I know I need my makeup to last all
day
this is silicone free by the way and it
won't clog your pores sometimes silicone
can clog your pores a little bit so yeah
enough rambling I'm going to leave a
link down below where you can purchase

promo code so yeah if you want to see
how to get this makeup look then just
keep watching okay so I have already
started out with moisturizer on my face
now I'm going to use the skin Danai via
makeup primer spray so you want to make
sure that when you spray this you're
pretty far away you don't want to spray
it like right here because you'll just
have like a big blob you wet mess well
I'll be witness moving on to foundation
I love using my Revlon Colorstay
foundation honestly it's probably the
one that lasts the most on my face aside
from the makeup over face and body this
one is like glue as well but it's kind
of luminous and lightweight lightweight
is lightweight I use the one that's for
normal to dry skin for obvious reasons
but if you have really oily skin I would
use just the regular one and I'm just
going to it's a little bit dark it's a
little bit Zonk
so I'm just going to mix it in I'm just
going to sit like a hair just the hair
of my 150 this foundation is really full
coverage so I like it when I'm going out
to places and it does have SPF 15 but I
don't think it looks bad in photography
like sometimes foundations will give a
really like gross flashback but I really
don't think that this one does for
concealers when I want a bulletproof
concealer look I have two that I really
love that is the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer or the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer these two once they set they
go nowhere they dry it down to like a
matte but natural finish it's not do we
it's not cakey and it doesn't fade
throughout the day these concealers are
the best today I'm going to use the pro
longwear and nw20 can you
the Real Techniques contour brush to
apply that underneath my eyes and
usually like on a day-to-day basis I
will just drag this up onto my eyelids
and use this as my eyeshadow primer but
I'm not going to do that today because
when I want my makeup to last like my
eye makeup to last all day I like to go
in with an actual eyelid primer because
that works a little bit better okay so
you guys know I don't typically set my
face because my skin is so dry for the
sake of this video I am going to set my
face and especially if you have normal
to oily skin you want to set your face
even if you have dry skin it's just
going to prolong the wear of your makeup
I'm using my Rimmel stay matte
long-lasting a pressed powder in
translucent I'm going to set my
concealer with this and set the rest of
my face just a little bit with this
powder I don't find it to be very very
translucent like it's a little bit white
but if you use it gently it serves its
purpose I actually really like it I'm
going to go ahead and move on to my eyes
really quick before I finish the rest of
my face okay so for my eyes I find
because my eyelids are so dry that a lot
of eyeshadow like lasts a really long
time but sometimes it's a little tricky
when you have oily eyelids for your
makeup to last all day on the eyes I
have found the best primer for that is
the NARS smudge proof eyeshadow base
this will not let any of your eyeshadow
to crease so your eyeshadow will stay
intact the entire dates kind of scary
if you really want to take the extra
step I recommend using cream eyeshadows
um more so like Mac Pro Longwear Paint
Pots are they called prolong or just
regular paper paints Mac Paint Pots but
I find that even these last longer than
paint pots these are the Maybelline
Color tattoos 24-hour cream eye shadows
color tattoos so I am going to use this
I'm going to use the one in chocolate
suede but really quickly I want to apply
a crease color I'm going to use the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette this is a
tried-and-true my favorite palette in
the world these eyeshadows last on my
eyelids and they're just fabulous so I
highly recommend this palette I'm going
to take this morphe 27 and dip it into
this regular like brown shade can you
say yeah
I'm doing a really really easy look for
today because I want to mainly focus
this look on the face makeup like how to
make your face makeup last all day by
the way I woke up today and I sound like
a boy do I sound like a boy it was that
I don't know why um I don't know I'm not
sick I just broke woke up with like a
very raspy voice today with that same
brown color I'm gonna take it onto my
lower lash line by the way that brown
color is called milk chocolate forgot to
say that okay so for eyeliner you're
going to want to find an eyeliner that
really really holds well in your
waterline whether that be a waterproof
one it doesn't matter
everybody's eyelids are different and
everybody's waterline is different I
feel so it's just about trial and error
I would recommend trying ones that say
waterproof or like smudge proof and use
those eyeliners in the waterline those
tend to last longer
this isn't waterproof but it stays a
long time on my waterline this is the
NYX gel pencil liner in black and I'm
just going to line my waterline with
this and then a trick I always do a lot
of people don't like say that this is
bad but I've never had a problem doing
this a trick I always do is take a
shadow and kind of set that eyeliner
that we put down not like directly in
the waterline but I try to get it as
close as possible to just set the cream
and it lasts a lot longer so I'm going
to take this dark dark brown color
called amaretto no it's called triple
fudge pop what and I'm gonna play this
really close
okay so now for the eyeshadow like I
said I'm going to use this color tattoo
in chocolate suede this is a zueva
concealer buffer brush and gonna pump
pump what I'm just gonna do this and
then I apply it to my lid some more
product
I'll blend it out in a second
I'm gonna go back in with Sir Harold
this I should like a dog back into milk
chocolate with this morphe brush I'm
just going to blend everything out again
okay so I just added a little bit more
of that dark brown just to balance
everything out earlier when I said I was
doing a simple look I meant easy not
natural obviously I'm just going to
quickly highlight with this color right
here this is white chocolate and then
champagne champagne champagne truffle
for the inner corner then I'm applying
mascara
honestly just use your favorite like
waterproof mascara or your just your
favorite mascara that you know doesn't
flake throughout the day and lasts and
holds a curl so I'm just going to apply
my Maybelline the colossal volume and
then I'll finish the rest of my face
okay so now I'm going to finish off my
face I'm sorry this video is so long
already I'm actually going to apply a
cream highlight to my cheeks first it
never should put cream over powder and I
already powder my face but I find that
this is a really disturb what's
underneath I'm going to use my cream
color base in shelf from Mac and I'm
going to apply this to my cheekbones
because a really good tip on making your
highlight last all day is to layer your
highlights so I would suggest putting a
cream underneath creams usually lasts
longer and then powders and then put a
powder on top to kind of set it and your
highlight will stay Jennifer Lopez II
all day
for contour I'm just going to quickly
come for my cheekbones and really really
lately I mainly want to focus on the
bronzer I'm going to use next but to
contour I'm going to use the caramel
toffee wet-and-wild contouring palette
and I'm going to use the contour side
obviously just very lightly this is a
morphe
because I mainly want to focus this look
on some Ness bronzer but this is going
to just carve out the cheekbones a
little bit I don't know if you can tell
it just kind of gives a little bit of
definition so with the same brush I'm
going to bronze up my skin and when I
want my bronzer to last all day this
works this is the Too Faced endless
summer bronzer is a 16 hour long wear
bronzer so it's supposed to last 16
hours on your skin I've never tried it
for 16 hours but it does stay on my face
the entire day when I use it so I'm just
going to rub my brush in it and just
bronze up my cheeks it is matte you can
go ahead and contour with this but it's
a little bit it's neutral so you can
contour with this but I just wanted to
add them
okay so now I'm going to move on to
blush and these are the best blushes if
you want it to last all day I keep
talking about all day all day but I'm a
little repetitive blush is the first
thing to go like when you put on your
makeup at the end of the day usually you
can't even see your blush like blush is
the number one thing to fade on your
face to fade on your face yes so I'm
going to use the Tarte Amazonian clay
12-hour blush these blushes last forever
on my cheeks any color works they have a
huge selection of colors and I'm just
going to use this one it was like the
limited edition tartlet one in the shade
celebrated because you know one of my
eyes are dark I don't want to go like a
super pink just going to clean off this
brush on a towel the same brush I was
using and use it as a blush I'm obsessed
with this brush side no more ve three if
you haven't tried these 12-hour blushes
they're good just gonna add a little bit
of color and honestly what I would
recommend if you are putting on um blush
and you're not going to touch up your
face like if you have if you have to do
your makeup and make sure that it lasts
all day I recommend putting a little bit
more blush than you usually would and
now I'm just going to set that highlight
I put down using the hourglass luminous
light and I'm using this one because
it's actually pretty natural and it
doesn't look super frosty on the cheeks
I have a lot of lip liners I am a
lipliner junkie but to me the lip liners
that last forever on my face are these
la girl endless semi-permanent Auto
lipliner long-lasting all-day wear
they're not kidding these semi-permanent
are like semi-permanent this isn't a
shade natural I'm just gonna line my
lips these are so affordable and they're
so long wearing now because I don't want
my lips to be this dark at all um like
it's too dark for this look I think you
could I mean whatever I'm going to take
the Cielo all day liquid lipstick in the
shade goes up Carosa and put it on top
liquid lipsticks in general will be your
best friend if you want your makeup to
last all day and you don't want to
retouch your lip product because they're
like cement and they don't go anywhere
so I'm going to actually put some on my
finger and blend this in if you want to
throw on a gloss you can just keep your
gloss in your purse and retouch
throughout the day since glosses don't
last as long as like matte products do
so now for the most important step
honestly I think it's even more
important than the primer spray it's the
finishing spray this is just going to
set everything in place and make your
makeup last all day this skin to Naevia
finishing spray is no joke so I'm just
going to shake it spray
and while that dries with my coffee it
takes a minute or two to fully dry but
that completes this makeup look it's
nice and glowy and it'll stay that way
the whole day I really hope you guys
