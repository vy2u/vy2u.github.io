tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now and today is an exciting and fun
video because everything on my face is
under $10 Totti from glam life guru
recently did a video where she did a
full face of makeup using only makeup
products that were less than $10 so that
is what I'm doing for you guys today
everything on my face is under 10 bucks
except the eyeshadow palette I use the
eyeshadow palette II use is $10 and I
know everything is supposed to be under
$10 but the eyeshadow palette is $10 so
I'm sorry I'm sorry but yeah I totally
love this look I think it's fun and I
really love the products that I used so
I will link Tottie's video down below I
tag anybody who watches this I tag all
youtubers and yeah if you want to see
how to get this look then just keep
watching okay so I'm gonna start off
with my eye makeup I'm going to prime my
eyelids using the essence I heart color
intensifying eyeshadow base I'm not sure
if this is new or not I recently
purchased this at Ulta but I had never
seen it before they had a different eye
shadow base that I've used in the past
but it was too yellow for me it was good
but it was a little bit too yellow so I
saw that came out with like a pinky
creamy vanilla shade so I wanted to
snatch that up okay so now I'm going to
go in with the elf mad format eyeshadow
palette I'm technically cheating with
this product because this is ten dollars
and I know it's supposed to be under ten
dollars but it's so good and perfect
then it's ten bucks so don't hate me I'm
gonna take this first shade right here
and I'm just gonna set my primer with
this
then I'm just gonna have a little bit of
tape to the side of my eye putting this
on the back of my hand I know I
shouldn't be putting tape on my skin but
I think they actually make tape that's
like okay for skin I think I've seen k2
use it I'm not sure but I'm just going
to apply this right here to create kind
of like this sharp line now I'm going to
take my morphe r38 brush and I'm going
to dip it into this brown color right
here and I'm going to put this into my
crease I'm going to take this really
really warm reddish brown with the same
brush and just start focusing this on
the outer corners of my eyes and drag it
into the crease
with that same brush I'm going to take
this pinky shade right here and blend
out the edges my lighting is a little
bit weird in this video because I'm
filming this very late at night and I
usually film during the date now I'm
going to take my Adel iam tools 7 7 6
brush I'm going to take this really dark
almost plummy Brown and only focus this
really close to the tape right there on
the outer corners I'm not going to drag
this color into the crease on a clean
fluffy brush I'm just going to blend
everything i sware lifting up your
eyebrows like this really helps you
blend I'm going to take my morphe r41
brush I'm going to highlight underneath
my brow bone with this shade this shade
is actually like the exact color of my
skin so there's not much highlighting
but it gives a little bit of smoothness
I'll add some of my face highlight under
there
later on I'm also going to take that
same shade with my wet and wild little
eye shadow brush and I'm going to apply
this right here kind of clean up the
look a little bit now I'm taking the
essence eyeliner waterproof pen it has a
felt tip and I'm just gonna line you
know you know what I'm gonna do I have
to get really close to the camera okay
so I finish applying my eyeliner and
honestly I have to get like this close
to my mirror in order to do my eyeliner
and even then I'm not that great at it
so please forgive me I had to do that
off camera but it just you know just
lined my eye
I also took off the tape oh my gosh I
forgot to put on eyeliner on my tight
line so let me do that really quick I'm
going to tightline my eyes using the NYX
gel pencil liner in pitch black Mitel is
your Lee I love this
okay so now I'm just gonna move on to
the rest of my face I'm going to finish
up all of my face makeup before I finish
the ice for primer I'm actually going to
use the Nivea men sensitive post shave
balm I wanted to use one of my NYX
primers but they're both over $10 so I'm
going to use the post Shea ball I
haven't used this in forever and I don't
know why because it actually is so good
it makes your makeup last all day it
technically isn't a primer but I'm going
to use it as one for foundation I'm
gonna go in with the Milani conceal and
perfect two-in-one Foundation and
concealer I hadn't been using this for a
while because I had the wrong shade it
was way too dark for me so I ended up
picking up creamy vanilla hopefully this
matches me better I haven't used it's
brand new and well that's yellow we
shall blend it out no worries this
foundation is actually really really
nice it has full coverage and it lasts a
long time at least on my skin my skin is
just going through it guys like it's
going through it you were all saying
that my skin was going through a detox
because I've changed my diet and I've
been eating a lot healthier I've just
cut out dairy and fast food and stuff
but I'm not sure if my skin has been
detoxing for like over five weeks I
don't know if detox is last that long so
that's a pretty long time and it's not
getting any better so for concealer I'm
going to use the Catrice liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer this
has really good coverage as well it's
waterproof it does not smelled it at all
but it's really really good
on top of that just to make it a little
bit brighter I'm going to use the wet
and wild highlighting and concealing pen
this is in the shade ivory in to you and
I'm just gonna land it and then blend
that in with the same sponge this is the
pure contouring sponge I really love
this wet and wild highlighting concealer
like way more than I like the maybelline
one way more than I like the L'Oreal one
and it's even cheaper I'm going to set
everywhere I put concealer and I think
I'm just going to set the rest of my
face to because this foundation can stay
just a little bit tacky I'm going to use
the NYC smooth skin
loose face powder in the shade
translucent it can be a little bit messy
but this powder is awesome it actually
reminds me a lot of the Laura Mercier
translucent powder because it has like
that bone color as well and it really
just sets the face nicely
it doesn't look powdery on the skin and
that's a big deal for me especially
since I have dry skin a lot of powders
can't emphasize that this one doesn't
and it's like under $4 it's crazy but is
good
I love eight this is not big enough to
set my whole face but we're already
doing it so let's roll it you know what
I'm actually gonna finish up my eye
makeup and then I'll do the rest of my
face okay so to finish up the eyes I'm
going to take this color pop by liner
this is their crumb gel liner in the
shade bee-sting the coolest blue ever
I'm going to drag it outside of my line
a little bit
and then I'm going to go in with this
little elf pointed pencil brush that
comes out next month these are not
released yet but I love this for
smudging eyeliner it's so good
on top of that I'm going to take this
color pop eyeshadow in the shade too shy
it's such a cool color it looks purplish
blue in some lights and then it looks
like an aqua blue in other lengths it
also has like little glitters everywhere
I'm going to take my morphe 36 brush dip
it into this eyeshadow and just apply it
really lightly on top of this blue
because I just want a hint of glitter
now I'm gonna go in with mascara I'm
going to use the Jordana best lash
extreme mascara probably like the most
affordable mascara I own but I'm going
through a phase where I'm not loving it
I'm just so used to my Kiko extra sculpt
Volume Mascara which you guys know is my
favorite mascara of all time but it's
$14 so I couldn't use it in this video
this one is worth it because it is so
inexpensive but it can get a little bit
clumpy a little too quickly and then for
my inner corners I'm going to take the
highlight I'm going to use on my face
this is the essence pure nude
highlighter in the shade B my highlight
which is like such a strange name but
I'm gonna take the more feet are 41
brush and apply this underneath my brow
bone I'm obsessed with this this is so
amazing it's ridiculous how cheap it is
in terms of price but how amazing and
not cheap it is in terms of quality okay
so that completes the eyes the mascara
is a little bit clumpy but we can look
busty okay so now I'm going to contour
my face I'm going to take the crease
prime and fine professional contour
palette this is in the shade actually
radiance I actually haven't used this
year and I've had it for like a while
but I'm gonna contour my face this is
like one of
those NARS brushes it has like a weird
name like a couple Guido geeky I'm gonna
contour my face with this I hope it's
not too ashy it looks pretty gray I want
to do another one of my full face using
drugstore makeup and affordable brushes
video I always do drugstore videos you
guys know this but a lot of the times
I'll just use the brushes I have on my
vanity and not all of them are
affordable so I want to do another one
of those kinds of videos because they
really like filming them so this does
blend out really nicely and it does give
you the illusion that there's like a
shadow they're just gonna contour my
forehead a little bit because we all
know is be okay so I just wanted to
contour a little bit but I want to
bronze up the skin so I'm going to take
my airbrush powder brush from it
cosmetics and I'm gonna take the NYC
smooth skin bronzer in the shade sunny
an oldie but a goodie and I'm just going
to warm up the face
gonna bronze my neck a little bit
because I want everything to match okay
so for blush I'm going to take my most
affordable blush in my collection this
is from the brand la colors you can get
this like at the dollar store this is
the mineral blush in the shade natural
and I'm gonna take my a cosmetics blush
brush and just dust this on the cheeks
and then for highlight I'm going to take
my Real Techniques setting brush and dip
it into the essence highlighter I used
earlier and I'm going to put this
everywhere not everywhere gives you a
glow from within it's amazing and so
whole affordable it's crazy it's crazy I
would put it on my forehead like I
usually do but mama's got some crap on
that forehead for lips I don't know if I
want to go with this or if I want to go
with this hmm I think I'm gonna go with
this one because it is more affordable
than the Milani one so this is the LA
girl matte flat finish pigment gloss
it's a liquid lipstick and it's in the
shade Fleur Fleur Fleur
I actually really like these there's a
couple colors that I don't like that
they're a little bit patchy but Fleur
Fleur is actually my favorite one out of
all of them okay guys so that completes
this video this was a full face of
makeup using makeup products that are
under $10 and some of these products
were even under $5 so I hope you enjoyed
