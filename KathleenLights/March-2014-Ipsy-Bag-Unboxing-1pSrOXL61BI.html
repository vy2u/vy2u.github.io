my monthly empty bag unboxing I got my
Ipsy bag a couple of days ago and I'm
sorry for the lack of videos lately I
haven't posted a video in a couple of
days and I know that is pretty rare for
me it's just been a crappy couple of
days I've had pretty bad anxiety and I
don't like filming if I'm in like a
really really crappy mood but I woke up
this morning and I was like no the show
must go so here we are
oh okay so the little card comes
attached to the back this time I guess
people just don't read them so they
decided to attach it to the bag okay so
basically all this little card tells you
is that the bag is inspired by San
Francisco's street Anatomy and I have to
say it's I don't know it's not my
favorite it's not my favorite bag but
anyway to the important stuff ok so
right off the bat the first thing I see
is this marvelous Moxie I didn't expect
this this marvelous Moxie lipstick from
bareMinerals I am a huge bareMinerals
fan and it is a tiny little sample size
of it and mine is in the shade get ready
I'm guessing that is P shape yeah and
this is what it looks like it's really
cute packaging and it is a nice kind of
like Mavi pinky a Mavi pink I don't know
it's really pretty and like I said
before I love bare minerals they are a
high-end brand and the full-sized
version of this is $18 I'm not exactly
sure how much this is since it's a
little baby but the full size is $18 the
next thing in the bag is this oh oh dear
Nicole by OPI nail polish and this is
what it looks like it is from that
little rough list collection that they
came out with I saw in the Ipsy website
they have like a pink one a yellow one a
blue one and a purple one I think and
it's supposed to be like a top coat
you're not supposed to put a top coat on
top of this because it is like a
textured um
type of nail polish like it's supposed
to look like sand on your nails I think
from what I've seen anyway um I really
love this brand the Nicole by OPI is an
amazing brand they sell out at Target I
have a bunch of nail polishes from them
and I love it so I would look I'm kind
of excited to see how this looks on my
nails I don't really have many nail
polishes that have that textured effect
so I'm excited to see how this looks and
I believe that these nail polishes
retail for about eight dollars like a
target or Ulta or something like that so
the next thing in the bag is what I was
most excited for and it is the be a
bombshell eyes shadow quad in Bora Bora
user got this or the NYX eyeshadow trio
and I was like please I don't want the
NYX eyeshadow trio I really wanted this
because the colors in this look wat are
amazing this is what it looks like and
this is what the amazing colors on the
insides look like I really wanted it
because this looks like it's going to be
perfect for summer I don't know it just
feels so like Island Dee to me I love it
so when I saw in my glam room that I had
this over the NYX trail I was like I'm
so so excited to use this and these
retail for sixteen dollars which is more
than you paid for the Ipsy bag you know
I was gonna say that didn't you can we
just take a look at this like red color
right here it's like garnet Goldy red
right here can we just take a look at
that that's beautiful okay and the last
oh no no no they did they did out a big
card they just put it in the bag sneaky
sneaky okay so the last thing in my bag
are these uh these little samples these
are the chlorine patches soothing and
relaxing patches with soothing
cornflower eye contour oh I guess these
are just like hatches for underneath
your eyes to soothe them and to make
them feel nice so I'm excited to use
that and actually don't know how much
these cost because I cannot I cannot
find it anywhere on the website so but
they look expensive don't they don't
they look fancy
these look like fancy little samples
they look a smile
okay so that is everything I got in this
month's hypsi back it was for items
instead of the typical five but I think
that I'm very very um I'm very impressed
with everything that I got loving well I
just got it but I love the UM be a
bombshell quad and I love the lipstick
and seems like the nail polish is pretty
cool and you know I don't know I really
really liked it let me know down below
what you got in your hip C bag cuz I I
want to know and now on to the part of
the video that you guys all like so I'm
going to try on this lipstick I really
really love it like in the tube I hope
it's just as nice so this is what the
lipstick looks on my lips I'm obsessed
with it I love it and what I like so
much about it is the formula it looks
really really glossy and it feels nice
it feels super moisturizing a plus I
love this color
more than anything I love the color
let's see how it's watches all me nails
ah this looks funny I'm gonna let it dry
a little bit before I do a second coat
and then I'm gonna zoom in cuz this
looks really cool I'm digging this when
I sound so raspy today I don't know if
I'm getting sick story of my life
I'm always sick see from far it looks
like just regular nail polish but no it
is so cool I don't know if you can see
that that it looks like so textured and
like it looks like sand okay and this is
what the quad looks like up close these
colors are amazing
this one is I'm going to do like a quick
little look with this quad to see the
pigmentation and stuff
okay so this is a little look I did with
the quad obviously it's a little sloppy
because I did it literally in five
seconds and there's not exactly a
transition shade in this so I would use
a couple different colors outside of
this quad but the pigmentation is really
really good
everything is super vibrant super
pigmented I love this
I would definitely purchase this on its
own and I'm going to look into the other
um bombshell quads because I love this
set at the end of this video guys thank
you so much for watching and thank you
so much for subscribing please subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you in my next video bye
for those of you who think my face
doesn't match my chest

shadow right here makes my chest look
super white oh wait till the Sun comes
