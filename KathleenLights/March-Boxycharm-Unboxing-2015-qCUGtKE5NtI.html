my home I got this always happen it's
March I don't know I know I'm month I'm
in this always happens my March
boxycharm unboxing it told you guys
in my previous video that this video is
next I just filmed a Q&amp;amp;A video that is
why I'm in the same clothes I was in my
last video okay so you know the drill
okay so this is what the inside of the
box looks like this month booties and a
card says lucky charm lucky charm and
this is where it has the prices and
stuff so let's get on into it there's
also a 20% off tarte coupon code in this
box if you want to buy anything from
tarte calm use the code box the April
I'll leave the code below and it's from
April 1st through the 10th so when April
first runs around rolls around take a
bend in it okay so the first thing you
see is this cute yellow bottle so I want
to grab it so this is an Oscar blondie
pronto dry shampoo spray I've heard
Oscar closer
I've heard of Oscar blondie a ton but
I've never owned anything from that
brand and I love trying the dry shampoos
my holy girls batiste so let's see how I
feel about this one this is a travel
sized product this travel size is 11
dollars there's a person 11 dollars so
that's pretty pricey for a little
shampoo like this my full-size batiste
is like eight so let's see if this is
good I'm actually gonna spray it to
smell it
don't look crazy oh my god it smells
good I don't this smells really good oh
my god that lady is dragging her dog I'm
really good no oh no white cast no white
cast okay so I will definitely test this
out a little bit more this would be a
great like traveling product take on
vacation because it's a little and it's
compact and it actually smells really
good okay so the next product is this
guy right here and this is lvx
latin light nail lacquer so this is the
nail polish and it's gel like finish
cruelty-free and vegan ooh I like the
sound of that and I love this color oh
my god this is such a beautiful mint
color it's actually coming out more
green
well this dry shampoo really does it
give me some volume holy crap
it's actually picking up like more green
on camera in real life it's definitely a
light mint enough it's showing up it I
love this color
especially in the springtime they're
really nailed it with the color
selection because I don't know if
everybody got this green but it's such a
beautiful green I love colors like this
actually I have quite a few of these
little mint colors because they're my
favorite to wear in the spring this and
lilac are like my favorite this is a
full-size nail polish and this nail
polish retails for $16 okay next is this
little guy right here this is the tarte
lipsurgence natural lip tint in the
shade charm charmed I'm sorry I love
these I have a couple of these that
Laura gave me at IMATS and I love them I
think there's so much training so
buttery and they're perfect for the
spring and summer so I'm really happy
that we got this color because it's so
light I'm kind of
it's not like a berry or anything this
is just like an everyday throw in your
purse shade so I really appreciate the
color most of all and I don't think I've
ever seen this one I have exposed which
I really love too but yeah I love these
they're really good
this is of course a full-size and this
retails for $24 next thing in here is
this Oprah eyeliner water-resistant
pencil suitable for most sensitive eyes
and lip areas oh this could be both well
it's definitely an eye liner and it is
like a really cool blue like can you see
that it's like a nice teal I don't
typically love wooden eyeliners like
this is that guy that yes you're back
with your dog I don't typically love
wooden eyeliners but I do have a couple
of eyeliners from Oprah from past the
boxes and they seem to work pretty well
so I can't complain this is a full size
product in retails for $13 okay and then
the last thing in the Box is this thing
and it's like packaged like all a list
so this will be this is the provides or
provides time now's a glacial provides
provides skin type one six okay what is
this whoa Universal tonic free of
parabens silicones and skin clogging
petroleum ingredients nutrify skin type
hydrates the skin and speeds healing
while fighting free radicals and
surfaces and surface irritants apply
sweat clean and dry face by squeezing
five drops on the palm of your hand
gently rub with your fingertips to warm
and emulsify for an even oliver up of
kate jeans
so this basically has hyaluronic acid
daisy flower extract and it's supposed
to help lighten and brighten the skin so
it's like a serum kind of it comes in a
dropper and this is super cool I am like
a skincare junkie like
good junky oh my god and it's not an oil
why did I think it's an oil it's very
very soft it's kind of like a water so
this would probably really really good
like under moisturizer at nighttime or
like under all your products in the
daytime as well definitely going to be
using this I don't know I love to try
out different skincare this is a
full-size products and it retails for
$48 so yeah girl that's offensive the
fact that you paid $21 for a box and you
get a product that's $48 in your box is
mind-boggling to me it's literally less
than half that's crazy so I definitely
love the box this month especially the
nail polish the Tarte product and I'm
really excited about that skin thing
those are my three favorites I
definitely definitely highly recommend
