my bestie shoe maxing I'm gonna go in
and open this already with the brush
don't know why I've never done that
before it's so easy like that okay so
when I open up the box this is what it
looks like it says sweet treats sugar is
sweet but this box is sweeter apparently
they didn't add the prices of each item
on the card this month I don't really
know why maybe they were just testing it
out or maybe it's just for this month
but the list of the products is not on
here and the price isn't on here which
is kind of bumming me out because I like
to tell you guys the price and the
overall value of the box and it also
tells you like what each item is I hate
just being blindsided and not knowing
what it is
so I'm hoping they start doing that
again next month where they add like the
list and the prices but for this month I
guess not let's move on I'm really
excited because I immediately was drawn
to these things right here this is so
exciting they have to makeup geek
eyeshadows in the box this month which
is crazy because even though makeup geek
is an affordable brand it's a very
popular brand and people really really
like it and her quality is so good so I
have cosmopolitan and Coco bear which
are really great eyeshadow cosmopolitan
is actually in the new mani palette so
it's really cool that you got it in the
box and Coco bear is just like a staple
it's a great great eyeshadow and I think
that her eyeshadows are around $6 so
this is like 12 bucks total
I already have these eyeshadows so I'm
going to pass them to my friend so I
don't want to open them but that's
awesome like make a peak in boxycharm
that's amazing
alright what's next this pink brush this
is a Luxy brush I have a ton of Luxy
brushes I think that they are so
underrated
they are amazing quality Luxy is so good
and this is the small contouring brush
I'm not
exactly sure at the price of this this
is a contouring brush
I don't really contour with these kinds
of brushes I like to blend out concealer
highlight with these kinds of brushes
but amazing nonetheless very soft okay
so next product in the box is this guy
right here since I don't know what this
is let's let's see Catherine Malandrino
style de Paris goodies these do not
spray into the eyes alright sis a
perfume
how about is it is it's a perfume I
think yeah I think it's called style
dear Paris I can't smell it that smells
like something I already own oh my gosh
what does that smell like I'm getting
kind of this is very sweet to me it's
like kind of like bubblegum e oh my god
this smells like bubblegum so I'm not
sure how much this is but I'm pretty
sure this is not full-size everything
else has been full-size but this is
obviously like a little travel spray I
don't mind I love travel sprays or
Rowlands but I do prefer a spray so I'm
glad that this is in a spray and not a
roll-on what does that smell like there
are two more products in the box so next
up is this clark's botanicals anti puff
eye cream holy crap this is ginormous
anti puff eye cream targets stubborn
puffiness dark circles and fine lines I
feel like this is an expensive product
because boxycharm loves to put like
really pricey skincare which is awesome
but I don't know the price so I can't
say dess expensive because I don't know
if it is how do you do that to me box
gym tell your friends okay and then last
thing in the Box is this I don't know
what it is but I'm going to read it this
is from the branch Ella and I know I've
received products from chela before I'm
not sure through boxycharm but I know
that I have this is the tantalizing
taupe eyebrow color oh it's a little
eyebrow product oh my gosh it's one of
these packagings so
this is great but I'm a little bit
concerned because what about people who
are not brunette like what about
redheads but this color does look like
it will work for me so I'm excited to
try this so I don't know the overall
value of the box so I can't give you
that
but I really did like this month I'm so
surprised not surprised but I'm really
excited that makeup geek is featured Lux
E is an amazing amazing amazing brand
for brushes and I'm really excited to
try this
eyebrow product so that completes this
video leave me a comment down below if
you liked your box this month what did
you hate what did you love let's chat
about it thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye
whoops oh good I forget money I'm pretty
sure I just saw hawk-like just like Oh
swoop oh I have a feeling this is a
pricey product because colour-pop was
talking about color this is a boxycharm
box I have okay probably just has for
this part I'll be balancing here for a
while tell me a story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
