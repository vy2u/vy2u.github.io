my back sherman bucks this video is
going up a little bit earlier this month
I normally don't post it so early in the
month but I got my box a little earlier
than huge and we're just going to dive
right in I look crazy because all I have
on my face is foundation concealer and
bronzer and blush my eyes are looking a
little bare and if you're new to my
channel or new to these videos that's
because I have a bunch of products in
this box I need to try on my face please
excuse my hair it is so puffy today I
can't I can't look it looks like this
sometimes it could control it sometimes
I can start just let my hair open a
quick messy bun because I really can't
handle it right now
I'm really having just one of those
terrible hair days I wonder why that
happened some days your hair cooperates
and some days it's like anyway so let's
jump right in shall we
so this is what the box looks like
inside this month
the theme is creepy cute and like the
colors and the first thing in the Box is
this guy right here so this is the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
and this is actually not their full size
this is their travel size you can buy
this size at Sephora though and it is
$16 and it is half an ounce but the
weird thing is that does have an island
scent is $16 but they're full-size which
is one entire ounce that's thirty-six
dollars but if you buy two of these it's
32 dollars and you're getting an entire
out isn't that kind of weird I know it
doesn't really matter but I did find it
funny that they're one ounce is 36 one
half of their ounces 16 I don't know I'm
crazy anyways this is actually a super
popular foundation primer I had it years
ago and I didn't really like it and then
when Smashbox like recently released a
bunch of primers it was sent to me again
by them and I tried it recently and
again I don't really like it so I'm not
going to use it cause I think it would
be a waste just to show you on camera if
I don't truly like it I got rid of mine
for a reason I think this might suit
those of you with oily skin or maybe
normal skin those of you who like a
silicon-based primer I think you would
really love this everybody loves this on
Sephora if you read the reviews it has
amazing reviews but for me personally on
my
dry skin I prefer a very hydrating
primer but it's awesome that we get it
in the box so that is the first product
awesome Smashbox a Laguna suit okay so
the next product in mace box is big this
is the Jumbo kabuki fan brush by the
brand crown brushes the SS 0.3 this is
obviously a full size brush and this
retails for 1899 now I don't really love
fan brushes there's a couple and do
really light but they're not freshly
typically reach for and I'm really
curious to know do you guys like to
highlight with a fan brush or do you
prefer a different kind of brush if you
like their brushes that I like to look
at but I never really use them and I
want to know if you guys really use them
because I'm weird and I just wanted to
but anyway this feels really really soft
like incredibly soft almost like and it
cosmetics kind of soft you know on fan
but I don't know if I'm going to like it
to highlight because it's like thick
licious and then I really like fat fan
brushes to highlight with I don't know
but let's try it out you never know I'm
just going to use my Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow highlight right
here and I'm just going to take the
brush dab it up in there capital capital
o if adults assuming oh my god it was
ignore my button going to go in with a
little more a little heavier this time I
actually really like how that applied it
is a little thicker than I'm used to so
a lot of the product just kind of goes
everywhere but I think it's nice to give
an overall glow mainly up here but it
does drag it a little bit down because
of the shape but I think if you're
looking for a more overall glow not
something that's so targeted and so
precise you might really like this brush
with my face shape that kind of looks
weird bringing the highlight so far down
but yeah I definitely like this brush
it's very soft and I like oh my gosh
this might be awesome to contour with
because it is so big and fluffy let's
try that let me clean this who's going
to take the contour part and I'm going
to see how this brush convoy
I already have phones wrong so they're
just going to be a little difficult to
tell but oh my gosh yeah totally
probably really great for around the
forehead too this gives you a super
precise contour oh my gosh is going on
behind that other little bead mm-hmm
okay I have to say I have like a bunch
of texture and here this is driving me
crazy but anyway I think I really like
this brush you can highlight with it
granted it's not going to be a very
precise highlight for that you're
definitely gonna want to use something
like this obviously you can see how big
this brush is so a lot more product is
going to deposit onto your face as
opposed to using this brush or any kind
of brush like this it's going to give
you a more precise application it's just
going to highlight like right here at
the top of the cheekbones but like I
said earlier if you want an overall glow
you want your whole face to highlight
this would be good for that and it also
has a really nice shape to contour with
it because it gives you like a nice
precise control mine looks kind of weird
it like dips here and that's because of
the way this barrel is pinched I don't
really like that I feel like my other
fan brushes don't have that issue maybe
if I wash it a couple times or I don't
know okay and then the next thing in the
bumps is this guy this is from the brand
Naked cosmetics I'm not going to pick it
out of the packaging because I actually
already have this it's right here this
is the urban rustic palette by Naked
cosmetics if you don't know about naked
cosmetics I heard about them for the
first time years ago at I'm at I'm sure
if you're an OG YouTube watcher you
remember that brand they had the Naked
pigment stacks and they were amazing and
so pigmented I feel like not a lot of
people talked about them because they
were pigments and press eyes shadow czar
just like easier to use people like them
more versus having to dip into a pigment
so they actually took some of their
pigment and they pressed them down into
an eyeshadow and put it in a little
pallet you could check out the Naked
cosmetics website and I love these
colors they are so beautiful they're
very colorful they're not super wearable
but I really like that I think it's
going to inspire a few people to maybe
play around with colors and I've already
played with this a few times this was
actually sent to me early by boxycharm
they wanted me to test it out before it
went into the box to see if I liked it
or what
about it and it's amazing look at this
look at this it's in stainless my god
most of the time I have no idea what's
going to be inside these boxes until it
gets to my front door and I open it but
when they sent me this in the mail and
they told me oh you know this might be
in a future box I was like yes please
put it in a future box because people
are going to love it okay so I obviously
can't do an entire look just with these
three eyeshadows I need two other
eyeshadows to use in conjunction with it
I need matte crease colors I need more
than just this so I'm just going to take
my ELF matte from that palette and I'm
going to mix a bunch of these shades and
I'm going to put that in my crease I'm
going to take the orange shade in the
middle and I'm going to apply this to my
entire lid might look a little crazy
from this mirror is not good I need this
anair man I forgot these eyeshadows do
have a bit of Fallout and I already have
foundation on that's gonna fall
everywhere just make sure you're doing
your eyeshadows first I always recommend
everyone through their eye makeup before
their face makeup just because if you do
have some fallout on your face easily
clean it up this has a ton of fallout I
completely forgo actually a good way to
avoid fallout is to just press it in
with your fingers like crazy things yeah
definitely apply them with your fingers
I have never applied this eyeshadow with
foundation on and I forgot there was a
ton of fallout the two times I used it
so yeah I have orange all over my face
now it's going to blend out the harsh
edges
I still have pink eyeshadow on this
brush from the pink smokey eye I did the
other day I need to wash my brushes so
that is the orange shade on my entire
lid just to use another shade I'm going
to go ahead and take the green color
I've never done this before let's hope
it work and I'm just going to pop it in
the center maybe not the best
combination yeah I don't know why I did
that either I'm gonna go ahead and put
some more elf shadows on my eyes and
then I will be right back okay so I
smudged out some shadows on my lower
lash line just so it could look a little
smoky I feel like I'm
Green made it look really weird I always
use these eyeshadows like completely on
their own I mean I've only used the
palette twice but the two times I used
it I used the orange and I used the
purple this is the first time I use the
green anyway I'm going to take the
purple and I'm going to smudge that on
my lower lash line when I do these
boxycharm videos where I try out
products on camera it's not supposed to
turn into like this amazing look I'm
just trying to show you what they look
like on the skin I'm not trying to do
anything special some of these looks
might not even make sense like today I
never ever ever well I wouldn't say
never but I rarely wear purple eye
shadow but this purple is so rich and
beautiful when I used it I used it like
a few days ago when I was going
somewhere and I used it just in the
outer corner makes it like a bronzy
shade from my Too Faced chocolate bar
palette and it looks awesome I love this
purple color please beware of fallout
okay so I'm going to pop on some mascara
and I will be right back
okay so I have to be honest the look I
did turned out a little bit sloppy I
should have done the ice first because
these are pressed pigment you will have
a lot of follow this so always do your
eyes first like I always recommend and I
try to use all three colors and I feel
like it turns out kind of weird okay so
the next thing in the Box is this guy
right here this is the real her expert
advice lip liner we have gotten this
brand in the box before I don't even
know what color this lip liner is I hope
it's a color that complements my eye
shadow oh this is in the shade I am
loved it looks like a burgundy
klippstein hmm I like this packaging oh
look at that
it feels very creamy there very creamy
if you have a lot like the colourpop lip
liners I guess we decided to fill my
entire lips with it huh of course today
it's not my day I'm like off in terms of
everything my hair my makeup was wrong
with me okay so I really like the color
of this lip liner a lot it's very creamy
you know it feels nice on the lips and
this is a full-size lip line of code and
this retails for $12.50 which is a
pretty good price okay and then finally
the last thing we have in the book
through this guy
yeah also from the brand real her and
this is the lady love matte liquid
lipstick is also a full-size liquid
lipstick and this retails for $15 and
the color is I am a rock star and by the
looks of it it looks like it would match
perfectly with this lip liner so this is
what the packaging looks like very very
pretty I actually like that a lot this
is the name like really big on the back
here yeah this is the perfect color for
this lip liner this smells like my
elementary school classroom or my
elementary school bathroom smells like
soap from elementary school whoa that
just took me back that was crazy okay so
this is the color after it completely
dried I feel like it dried really fast
it's still a little bit tacky but I
think that's because of the lip liner
underneath the lip liner stayed a little
bit sticky but look it doesn't it
doesn't really come off I'm gonna I
think I really really like this I want
to play around with it a little bit more
I want to use it on its own without a
lip liner underneath but I love the
combination of the two it gives you such
a beautiful bold vampy lip if you are
looking for a liquid lipstick that does
not transfer this one might be for Joo
but yeah that completes this video that
was everything that was in this month's
buxie cherm so I didn't matter on the
overall value of the box this month was
102 dollars which is amazing you pay
twenty one dollars a month for this box

month the only thing I don't see myself
using is this and I'm going to give this
