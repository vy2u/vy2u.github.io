my boxy Sherman buxom this is what the
box looks like this month
the theme is vacation very cute and I
guess we're just diving into the box
today aren't we oh there's a butter
LONDON 25% off a little coupon code in
this month's box you guys know how these
go I always take a little peek into the
box first just so I can see what to put
on my face or not because I like to try
on the products as we go and then give
you my initial first impression and
their eye gels in the box this month
which is why I don't have any face
makeup on just my crazy ass eyebrows I'm
going tomorrow to do my eyebrows I think
hopefully every time I've made plans to
do my eyebrows this past week something
always comes up but I think I'm gonna go
tomorrow they are so bushy right now
they look real crazy this is from a
brand called South Main Beauty and these
are their under eye gels I've never
heard of this brand before but this
little pack retails for $10 apply this
product onto the eyes leave on for 30
minutes to reduce puffiness and dark
circles for best results use for three
consecutive days so that is exactly what
I'm gonna do but let's pop one on right
now and see how it goes I'm all about
eye patches though I feel like I really
need to invest in some more or I just
got this juice all over my leg look at
my leggings they look like I peed myself
and then it trickled down my leg I'm not
flexible can you tell it was honestly a
struggle just to show you that leg but
I've been working on my stretches I've
been stretching a lot more recently I'm
gonna start doing yoga as well anyway
you guys don't care let's get back to
the point of this video so I'm just
gonna take them out they're like
connecting okay I'm pop it on a number
and try to get as close to my eye as
possible
mmm this feels really nice nice and
cooling
so I'm just gonna let that sit on my
skin for 30 minutes so far so good feels
cooling it feels like nice and silky
under here so I feel like it's gonna do
what it says it's gonna do the only
thing I don't like is the scent though
this smells like roses this has a rose
scent to it and I despise the scent of
roses like I do not like rose scented
things at all and I totally smell that I
don't know if that's what I smell but to
me it smells like roses big-time but I
mean that's not a big deal if it does
what it says it's gonna do I don't care
oh my god are they like falling down no
okay
I'll be back after 30 minutes okay this
has been cooking on my eyes for about 30
minutes now actually like you're only 35
minutes now I do want to say I did
notice that it just started to like slip
down after a little bit I constantly had
to like bring it back up to my eyes so
let's just pull these off Oh take these
off
my undereyes actually feel really
intensely moisturized I like the feeling
on my face but it says for best results
used for three days in a row I guess I
won't really know until I use it all up
but I could always use a little bit of
moisture under there so I mean I'm into
it I'm into it all right so the rest of
these products are actually things that
I'm gonna use after my foundation
concealer and bronzer and powder already
on so I'm gonna go ahead and do some of
my makeup off camera and then I will be
back okay so now we can move on to the
rest of the box and I'm gonna grab this
look okay this is from the brand pretty
vulgar I've actually tried out this
brand like awhile ago on my channel I
did like a full face of first
impressions I think these are they make
them blush blushes I believe that's the
name and this one is in hush blush this
is actually a really pretty color it's a
little bit deeper than I would go for or
like on a daily basis it's a very
natural blush it's kind of like a rosy
nude I think it's really pretty I'm
gonna pop some on my cheeks I'm gonna
take my little elf brush like from their
beautifully bare collection like these
clear brushes just gonna apply a little
bit of this I don't want too much blush
on you guys no it looks really pretty it
kind of gives you like a rosy flush to
the cheeks without being too pink I
think it's really pretty what do you
guys think it's a nice little flush so
yeah I think that's awesome let me get
this in the box cuz it's a high-end
blush and they saw this at Sephora so
that's really nice I might as well keep
you in this close since we'll be doing
stuff on the eyes
the next product in this box is this
little guy this is from a brand called
the vintage cosmetics company and it is
so cute I love their packaging so these
are three eyeshadow brushes and this
little box retails for 23 dollars and 15
cents that is so specific these are
actually so so cute oh my gosh they're
very very soft like wow super super soft
I have like little steps on them it says
step 1 for the money
step 2 for the shadow step 3
go girl go I don't know I don't get it
but these feel really really soft and
I'm very excited to use them now for my
eye look
besides that moving on we also have a
mascara in here we're about to try out
this is the butt
London double-decker lashes mascara and
I actually got this sent to me in the
mail by butter London but I haven't
tried it yet so I'm just gonna try this
one out 200% thicker lashes 314 percent
increase in last control where do they
get these numbers why 314 % why not
three hundred and fifteen percent I'm
like poor
these numbers and then the star of the
show is this palette this is a
collaboration between pure and boxycharm
I don't know if you guys saw that they
recently like went on a brand trip to
celebrate the launch of this guy and
look at what it looks like in the inside
I think it's such a pretty palette I
haven't played around with it yet I've
seen so many people do a bunch of looks
with this palette and they all look so
so pretty I got so many questions from
you guys asking me why I did go on that
brand trip boxycharm and pure took a
bunch of people to Mexico and it was the
most beautiful scenery I have ever seen
like it is it was so gorgeous I was
watching like rob Beauty Christie's blog
oh my gosh everything looked so
beautiful but they did invite me and I
love boxycharm so much and I almost went
but I just I don't really do Brian
Tripps not saying I never ever will I
just feel like I'm Way too awkward for
those kinds of events and then I would
like stick out like a sore thumb and
that I would be like in a corner by
myself but it looks so beautiful
and I'm very excited to try out this
palette so let's do that let's do that
right now all right so to save some time
I'm just gonna be pointing at the
eyeshadows and just doing my makeup
instead of like sitting here and telling
you what I'm doing I'm just I'm just
gonna roll with it so let's do that
while I use these
all right so the eyes are completely
done and now I'm gonna give you guys my
thoughts on these products I just use
first and foremost I love these freakin
brushes I think they're amazing they
applied everything so beautifully this
really packed on that cranberry color
this one was really nice on my lower
lash line it was really soft and I was
very surprised by this brush and all
three of them when I originally looked
at it I thought this one was gonna be my
least favorite but I really really liked
it so I'm so into these a plus and for
the mascara I think it's pretty good I
wouldn't say it's the best mascara I've
ever used and considering it's probably
oh I didn't tell you how much this costs
oh gosh I didn't even tell you how much
the palette was either okay so this
butter LONDON mascara is $20 and this
palette retails for $36 so yeah the
mascara is decent is a very dry formula
I could just imagine after using this
like five times it would be like way to
dry it's definitely not the best I've
ever used I like my L'Oreal lash
paradise more and it's like half the
price but it's not the worst I've ever
used either like it's okay the palette
though I really like this palette and
the back it says it's cruelty free
gluten free top free vegan friendly and
I'm really into it I mean I only used a
few colors but I really liked the eye
look it gave me this comes off a lot
lighter on the eyes than it looks in the
pan and at first that threw me off but I
actually really like this like hot pink
look the only color that really
disappointed me like right off the bat
was this one in squad it's kind of
chalky and crumbly like it doesn't
really apply nicely I had to use a
setting spray and even when I use the
setting spray it just it kind of did not
work like there wasn't I don't like this
color at all but once I went over it
with charmer right here I loved it all
the other eyeshadows I used are really
nice and even this one is so vibrant and
just it's just a really fun palette this
color is also really beautiful and
buttery look at the hint
so buttery so buttery mmm okay so I just
quickly popped on some moonchild
lipgloss from kind of pop as usual and
that's about it that is everything I got
in this month's box issue and the
overall value of this month's box is one
hundred and fifteen dollars which is
crazy
I say it every time I think my favorite
thing in this box believe it or not are
these brushes I feel like I'm gonna use
them so so much I'm gonna pop them right
here because there might need a little
frame the only thing that was like an
for me was this mascara but the rest was
pretty good but I would love to know
what you think of this month's box in
the comments below did you love it did
you hate it were you like and that's all
right let me know I would love to know
like I've said already okay anyway that
completes this video I really hope you
