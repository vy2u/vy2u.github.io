filming my March favorites and I know
I'm like a week late on the whole
favorites video but I have been
organizing my room as you can see I'm
not sitting on the floor an empty room
anymore I have my desk um my husband um
finally it was able to bring it in he's
been working so hard on it he built this
and I'm so excited I'm so thankful for
him I absolutely love it so I've been
you know busy kind of putting things
together seeing what I think looks good
you know you look good so I'm just going
to go ahead and jump into my favorites
of the month I have a few things um
first thing I wanna talk about is this
nail polish and it is OPI is
Mada by you it's what I'm wearing on my
nails right now and it looks like this
and it is just the nicest pink I
absolutely love this nail polish I used
to wear a lot of Fiji by Essie a lot
more than this and then when my sister
gave this to me I was like oh my god
this is the perfect pink I like it even
more than Fiji and I love that color and
usually I'll paint my nails and then
I'll move on and I won't paint them that
color for awhile but I've been painting
my nails a lot this month with this
color and with that being said this is
the most amazing thing I could ever talk
about I've been using it more than just
in the month of March I've been using
this every single time I feel my nails
since I bought it and it is the Revlon
Colorstay base coat and top coat and I
don't even know how to explain how
amazing this is everybody that I've
recommended it to has bought it and
absolutely loved it my mom absolutely
loves this I'm the kind of person that
my nail polish chips literally within
two days I don't know what it is my nail
polishes doesn't last like my sisters
will last a week with actually no base
coat or top coat that's just how it is I
my name is chip Austin so if you're like
me you need to pick these bad boys up my
nails last over a week with these things
it is amazing it's a taco and basically
and the taco is super super glossy
comparable to overbill especially
you guys used a sheet then check that
out
the next thing I want to talk about is
the Olay Total Effects of them one
blemish control silicic acid acne
cleanser and I did I got this in my
drugstore heart and oh my gosh I have
been using it every single day since I
bought it last month and I have never
had any face wash that literally leaves
my face feeling like a baby's butt if
that makes any sense this makes my skin
so soft and has cleared a lot of my acne
for some reason I've never been one to
break out a lot or anything that but I
had been getting like acne under my skin
this completely took it away it has tiny
little microbeads in it they're like
it's not an exfoliator by any means but
it has like little tiny beads in it that
I feel like clean your face a little bit
better without actually exfoliating or
anything like that so I have an
exfoliator besides this but this is
almost I love this thing amazing next
thing I want to talk about is this Sigma
little trio thing it comes with three
eyeshadows I got this when I ordered my
Sigma brushes last month I ordered some
Sigma brushes and it came like it's like
the little free gift thing oh my god I
think I'm going to pick up some Sigma
eyeshadows I don't have any of the
palettes but this is the size of this
shadow is called surrender command and
publicize and I guess this one's from
the Dare palette says dear on top of it
this is from the bear palette and this
from the flare palette and it's what I
have on my eyes right now are you doing
so yeah this is what I have on my eyes
right now I have been absolutely loving
this I think I'm gonna pick up some
Sigma ashes because this little trio
thing is amazing I know I'm a little
dark but I'm filming this pretty late
shouldn't of but I just wanted to get my
favorites out there before you know it's
like March and in April like 20th and I
still haven't gotten this video anyway
but the next thing I want to talk about
it's a little bit strange but it is
Vaseline and I have been using this on
my eyelashes every night
before I go to sleep for some reason my
adage is used to be really really long
and they've just broken and they're like
brittle now I don't know if it's because
of my eyelash curler it could be my
amateur I haven't been curling my
eyelashes for a while now because I'm
afraid that that's what it is
but since I've been putting this I
literally just coat my lashes with it
before I go to sleep and they've been
making them like really full and they
grow faster and so if you have very
short brittle lashes they've been
breaking off a lot then I think I
suggest you use some Vaseline on them
eyelashes before you go to sleep and
this works really good next thing I want
to talk about is this L'Oreal total
repair 5 damage Racing bump oh my god
guys guys turn this video off and go buy
this right now it says it repairs it's a
year of damage in one use and that's
really unrealistic if you think about it
but this made my hair is so soft and a
lot of the hair masks that I use I made
it soft while I'm showering but when I
got out of the shower my hair is not you
know that's soft anymore it's just soft
when I used it in the shower
no no no this makes your hair soft when
you blow dry here after you iron it
whatever if this softness is still there
and it's all thanks to this my hair has
kind of oh my god and it smells really
really good it's just yellow it's really
really thick and it's amazing my hair
has been a lot healthier since I started
using this thing I'm gonna pick up the
shampoo and conditioner if you have the
shampoo and conditioner let me know if
you like it I really love this next
thing I want to talk about is this fudge
clean blonde violet toning shampoo and
many people are like girl you ain't lon
but I do dye my hair blonde but I don't
use bleach so it gives it like that
Auburn color and I get blonde highlights
I do get bleached blonde highlights put
in my hair
I'm been trying to go blonde little by
little trying to
like the healthier way with the left 7g
way and let me tell you my mom is a was
a platinum blonde for most of my life
now she's like a dirty blonde and she is
a hair stylist and very critical the
purple shampoo similar she was use good
and she lent me her matrix one matrix
has a purple shampoo and it left my hair
super hard and I was like oh my god her
all-girl shampoo is like this she's like
all the ones I've tried
they make my hair hard like that to
shimmer lights loaded a lot so I decided
to pick this up because I saw it in
shant Shannon's video shine XO here on
YouTube and I was like when she did her
roots I was like her roots literally
went from orange to that white to that
like platinum color she has and I was
like whoa let me get me some of that
so I worded online and I put it in my
hair and I put in just leave it in for
five minutes
I left at him for a little longer than
that and oh my god it took the
brassiness out of my hair completely I
don't know if you can tell but in my
other videos my hair seems to be like
red orange or like getting really red
and I hate that this is amazing if
you're a blonde and you can't find a
good purple shampoo that takes away the
brassiness 100% pick this bad boy up it
is amazing next thing I want to talk
about is my L'Oreal True Match Lumi oh
my god greatest foundation greatest
thing I've ever discovered last month um
Revlon Colorstay is still like my baby
my number one but I have been using this
a lot especially in the spring which is
great it's not a completely finish but
it's not matte it's not flat it is so
good this is an amazing amazing
foundation if you have dry skin I think
you should check this out and even if
you have oily skin I think this would
look good because it's not a dewy
foundation like do we by any means I
really in it next thing I want to talk
about is this Maybelline Color tattoo
and barely branded it was that metals
collection this is the most beautiful
eyeshadow on its own and beautiful as a
primer oh my god I have it actually as a
primer under
this that I use today I use these two
things and it just it makes every eye
shadow you put on top just shine amazing
and I used it by itself or just slap it
on when I'm gonna hurry I want to go to
the door
slap that crap on and it makes it just
gives you a glow it this is I've been
using this over my Paint Pots I need to
give me some more of these these are
amazing next thing I want to talk about
is a self-tanning mousse and it is the
same where is Marie some I saw that
instant self-tanning mousse this one's
in dark and you shake it you put it all
over your body and this is amazing I
don't I don't right now because it has
faded I haven't used it in over a week
but this is so good and it's dirt cheap
I know they say that it's comparable to
the Saint Tropez but that's a lot more
expensive I don't know I've never used
that I got off of Amazon and what I do
is I completely moisturize my body
because this tends to make me itchy
because it really dries out your skin so
I moisturize my entire body put this on
all over my body my face on my face no
no no and then it says not to shower for
seven hours but I go to sleep I do this
after I take a shower and I go to sleep
with it on I wait a few hours and then I
go to sleep and then of course when you
put it on your face you're like um this
makes me look dirty I look like I just
rolled in moon but no once you wake up
and you shower and you know you wash
your face and wash your body eat leaves
the most natural but you know nice deep
ish tan it's so natural you look like
you've been sitting in the Sun for five
hours and you look crazy ten my sister
was like oh my god you don't look orange
at all you look tan because we've had
problems where the self-tanners look
orange like my Jergens one makes me look
freaking orange and this made me look
tan like tan absolutely let's I
recommend this to absolutely anyone I
suggest you get the dark one because I
feel like maybe the other ones might
make you look orange but this is amazing
I have to last things really fast that
about the first thing is this red can
smooth down heat glide oh my god I have
had this sitting in my bathroom for
months and months and months and I've
really never used it and I've always
used like other heat protectants and I
feel like they were good but this does
more than just protect your hair from
heat this has macadamia oil in it and
it's for very very frizzy hair it says
here for very dry unruly hair this makes
my hair feel like butter I can't I don't
even know I put this all over my hair
before I earn it before I curled it
before anything for a blow dryer and it
just changed my hair it gets rid of all
the frizz and it is silky shiny as hell
shiny and silky and this is amazing so
this is a great heat protectant and has
that oil limit that just makes
everything look good I really recommend
that it's amazing um but actually I
think the smooth down line might be
getting discontinued discontinued or is
discontinued already which is pissing me
off because they're smooth down line was
my favorite so I have to look into that
bedroom and then my last favorite is
this unlike almost done it is this T's
sexy little things from Victoria's
Secret they have like tees I don't know
they have other stuff too but guys when
I tell you that this smells identical to
Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy
so the viola juicy perfume by Juicy
Couture I am not lying I've worn this
literally every time that I wear this
someone's like are you wearing Viva La
Juicy and I'm like no I am wearing this
that cost me $25 okay if you just ran
out of your people Edition you're like
man I do not want to spend that much
money I'm able to see again go to
Victoria's Secret and violets you'll be
like wow Kathleen was a hundred percent
right this now
identical identical to be will you see
of course it's a body spray might not
last as long but for $25 for it to smell
exactly like one of my favorite perfumes
I'm all for that I said wait so yeah
those are all the things that I've been
absolutely loving in the month of March
