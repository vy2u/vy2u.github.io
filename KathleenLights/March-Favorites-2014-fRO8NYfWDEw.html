March favorites and I love foaming
favorites videos especially recently
because every time I felt my favorites
video it means it's just one month
closer to Danny so I'm gonna go ahead
and get started it because I feel like I
have a lot to share with you guys today
I don't usually have a lot of stuff to
share with you guys in my favorites
videos but this month I got I've got
some stuff to share with you so recently
I've been feeling like my Maybelline
under-eye concealer has been breaking me
out which is I know super strange
because I have been using it for like
years already recently I have been using
it to highlight my face I put it on my
forehead and down the bridge of my nose
and stuff like that which I never really
did before and I have been breaking out
on my forehead like crazy and I wasn't
changing anything else I wasn't using a
new foundation when I noticed the
breakouts or anything like that so how a
feeling it was the instant age rewind
concealer which broke my heart but I'm
giving that a rest for a while to see if
it is that or not and I have been using
the Rimmel match perfection
two-in-one concealer and highlighter
this is what it looks like and actually
really really like this it's not like a
full full coverage concealer it's not
gonna give you the coverage that Mac Pro
Longwear gives you or anything like that
but it does do a nice job of
highlighting my face I put it underneath
my eyes and you know all the places
where I would highlight and I like how
it just I don't know if brightens up my
face I actually really really like this
the only thing I hate about this it's
the stupid packaging it's one of those
squeezy type of tubes we have to squeeze
out the product but it's kind of hard to
squeeze and if you squeeze too hard you
get like seven million pounds of product
and if you don't squeeze hard enough
nothing comes out it's just a pain to
work with but the actual product is
pretty good another thing that I have
been really really loving that I haven't
mentioned on my channel yet is the bombs
new tube palette I have been using this
palette non-stop since I got it it is
literally the only palette I have been
using whenever I go out oddly enough I
haven't really used it in any of my
videos yet but the last couple of videos
I posted where they're not tutorials I'm
pretty sure I am using this this color
seductive is literally the most
beautiful color I
Sene it's just right up my alley you
know warms warm neutrals and stuff like
that it's really really good I love it
super pigmented pretty much the only
palette I have been using since I got it
I have been seriously obsessed with the
elf baked highlighters I hauled this a
few weeks ago and these things are
amazing I picked up three but these two
are my favorite ones this one is in the
color blush gems which is a really
pretty bronzy type of highlight and then
this one is moonlight pearl which is a
really nice like light golden champagne
kind of highlight reminds me a lot of
the mary lou manizer I love these
because they're not glittery they don't
have like chunks of glitter just falling
off them it does give you such a
beautiful sheen and it looks like you're
glowing I love it
actually have on blush gems right now
and yeah I go overboard because I always
do my highlights but it just makes you
look so like Jennifer a little busy I
don't know I really really love these
and they're super inexpensive definitely
check these out because they're worth
the three dollars so the blush that I
have been obsessed with all month is
this Sephora blush in the color
tangerine tease unfortunately mine broke
thank god the actual product didn't
break but it came out of this out of the
packaging so I have to superglue it but
this is what it looks like and it is a
beautiful beautiful like tangerine II
orange color and it has a little bit of
a sheen which makes you know it makes
your face glow I just love it I think
it's gonna be like the perfect blush for
spring and it's really really pigmented
it's just so beautiful I have a little
bit on my cheeks right now and I have
obsessed with this it has like a darker
more burnt orange on this side and then
a really nice shiny type of light gold
any peach color on this side and just
mixed together your face looks like a
beautiful little like a beautiful little
goddess I don't know I don't know why
I'm talking like this either
I love it okay so I want to give a quick
little shout out to these guys right
here these are the Milani shadow IDEs
and these are amazing they're just
basically giant jumbo crayons I use them
as a base for my eye shadows and they
last all day and they do not crease I
can't I can't tell you how good these
things are seriously they don't crease I
use them as a base and a primer I don't
even use primer underneath these because
they're that good these four colors are
my absolute favorites especially this
gold one right here this one is probably
the command number one favorite this one
is in the color golden bronze it's just
a beautiful pure gold shadow it's
amazing this is in the color sand dunes
and it's like a really pretty frosty
taupey color and then these two are
matte ones this one is almond cream and
this one is cafe au light cafe light not
even gonna pretend like I know how to
read French cafe liked it but yeah
definitely check these out they're
really inexpensive and they're really
great bases for eyeshadows they make
your eyeshadows look ten times better I
just I love these they're so good okay
so a lip liner favorite this month has
been Mac's magenta lip liner this is
like the most beautiful magenta color
it's a nice like hot purple I absolutely
love it I have been wearing it under
candy yum-yum
all the time I just love how this looks
under candy yum yum it just gives it
like an extra month and gives it like a
little hint of purple I love it I love
this under different pinks different
Purple's it's just the perfect purple
lip liner and even by itself I like a
little bit of gloss on top it's it's
amazing I love everything about this lip
liner so I just thought I had to mention
it because if you're gonna get any lip
liner at Mac go get magenta cuz it's
that good my nail polish favorite of
this month has been the nicole by OPI
nail polish in on what grounds and it is
the textured nail polish I got this in
my March hypsi bag and it has literally
been the only thing that I've had on my
nails since that day
can't get enough of it what I love most
about it besides the cool like texture
and the pretty color is the fact that it
is literally the easiest thing to do
like you don't even have to put a top
coat it's not even that messy you just
sweat Chuck's leg and you're done and it
dries in seconds I have I'm just
obsessed with this like I love it so
much by the way the shadows on my face I
know I've been saying this for a long
time but I mean it this time
like I'm serious I am getting I'm
getting lights I'm gonna buy them on the
1st of April I already have them in my
shopping cart and on the 1st of April I
am purchasing them because I can't deal
with the shadows and people have been
telling me that you know my lighting
sucks so thanks guys I'm trying ok so my
next favorite is something that I have
mentioned in my favorites video a couple
of times before I'm pretty sure but it
is coconut oil and you guys know how
much I'm obsessed with coconut oil it's
like the perfect seriously like the
perfect hair mask you could ever use but
I have been using this to take off my
makeup this is honestly the best eye
makeup remover I have ever come across I
keep this in my drawer where it's a
little bit warm in there because this is
a solid but it melts really really fast
like it melts really easily you have to
keep this in like a pretty cool climate
for it to stay solid so I like it in my
drawer cuz it's a little warm and when
it's nice and melted I just put it all
over my eyes and it just melts my
mascara off like it just melts my makeup
off I would still recommend coconut oil
no matter what for your hair for your
skin as a makeup remover it's amazing
just make sure it's organic pure extra
virgin coconut oil I got my off Amazon
and I'm almost out of it so I need some
Oh a major skincare favorite this month
has been the L'Oreal youth code texture
Perfector serum concentrate this stuff
is actually pretty freakin good I was
pretty skeptical when I went to go buy
it because it does have some mixed
reviews I know this doesn't work for
some people but I feel like it has been
improving my skin the issues I have with
skin is texture it's not so much acne as
it is like bumps on my face and like the
rough texture that I have on my face and
the crazy dryness and stuff like that
and this has actually really been
working my skin feels so much smoother
and I
using it for about three weeks now and
my skin just feels really really smooth
what I did notice about this is that I
have to use a moisturizer immediately
right on top because if not I feel like
it doesn't do much
I feel like this works best paired with
a moisturizer which it does come with a
moisturizer I mean it doesn't come with
one but there is a texture Perfector
moisturizer that maybe I should look
into buying but I really really like
this it has been improving my skin so
far and yeah I'm gonna continue to use
this okay so I am highly highly highly
obsessed with the aromatherapy line from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works specifically their
sleep line cuz I know that there's a
there's a stress relief one a sleep one
and I forgot the other ones but the
stress relief one is really good too but
the sleep one is definitely my favorite
I have the body lotion and the body
mists
I have mine in the lavender chamomile
scent there's another one that is
lavender vanilla that actually don't
like but this one smells amazing I love
their bottles I love that they're glass
which is kind of not good for someone as
clumsy as me but anyway I really really
recommend the body lotion it is so good
I really hate greasy lotions or the ones
that just linger on your skin like you
just feel like oh they're slimy stuff
all over my skin
I hate lotions like that this one just
it sinks into your skin so after my
shower I just lather my body up in this
body lotion and then I spray my whole
body with the body mist and I just feel
nice and calm I really don't think it
induces sleep by any means but it does
relax me and it doesn't make me feel
like I want to go to bed I just love how
calming this is it's amazing definitely
check out the sleep line it's like
wonderful wonderful
so my last favorite is a really random
one and it is not something that I loved
all month but it is something that I
read in March so that counts and it is
The Fault in Our Stars by John Green I
just had to mention this because this
book is phenomenal I don't care what
anybody says about it being pretentious
or I don't know I don't care this book
is amazing I'm a huge sucker
for what
little love stories like this and four
main characters that are just gonna make
me swoon over them I'm a huge suck verse
moaning yeah I love it but there was
something so special about Augustus
waters that I can't I can't even put
into words he reminds me a lot of attend
Saint Claire from Anna and the French
kiss which is another amazing book I
definitely recommend and in the French
kiss that one isn't sad this one is I
don't know it's a great great book even
though it is sad it is happy at the same
time and I just cannot wait for June
because that's when the movie comes out
and I hope I pray that the movie is as
good as the book definitely check this
out because you will not be disappointed
you will thank me for introducing you to
Augustus waters you will thank me okay
