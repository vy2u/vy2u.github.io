my March favorites I might get a little
awkward in this video because I live
right next to a middle school and kids
are walking home from school now and my
windows open so I'm going to talk about
all the products I have been loving this
month I'm still a little bit sick in my
last video I did the forever 21 haul and
as soon as I was done filming that video
like it hit me so hard I had to lay in
bed like I really feel like I had the
flu but I'm feeling a little bit better
so yeah so the first thing I really want
to mention is the elf high definition
under eye setting powder I've had this
for like a year and I never really liked
to use it because it had like little
shimmers in it but I actually really
really liked it and it's funny because
what made me want to use it is my laura
mercier secret brightening powder that i
bought and i ended up really really
loving so then i thought let me try my
elf one a little bit more because it
kind of has similar concept and ended up
really really liking it I do like my
Laura Mercier just a little bit more
because it doesn't have those flecks of
glitter but once you apply this under
your eye most of that glitter falls off
anyway
this is a great setting powder for your
concealer because it really minimizes
creasing it has that really silky like
HD texture that helps the concealer set
and it doesn't crease it was three
dollars and it's freaking amazing you
can get elf at Target and a bunch of
other places now and I really recommend
the high definition setting powder okay
so in a recent video I talked about how
there was an under-eye riser that I had
really really been loving and that I had
noticed an incredible difference but I
didn't really go into much detail and
recently a couple of you have told me
that my under-eye circles aren't as dark
as they used to be and I got a comment
like in my last video like hey have you
been using a different moisturizer
because your under eyes look a lot
brighter than usual without makeup like
I had a barefaced and I got like two
comments on that and I was like
oh my god people are noticing that's
crazy and I'm talking about the Kiehl's
midnight recovery I a restorative
concentrate of essential oils and
botanicals for fresher younger looking
eyes by morning I have been using this
religiously for about two months
hey Porter how'd you get here for about
two months now and Wow Wow
that's really all I can say I've used a
ton of under eye creams and there are
some that I really like the one that I
was using before this was the origins
one and I really liked it but once I
started using this and I saw the
incredible difference this made I
realized that every other eye cream
before this was pretty much crap I
didn't really notice results until after
like a month of me using it religiously
and my dark circles have minimized so
much they aren't as blue they aren't as
dark as they used to be my crow's feet
even like just this texture around my
eyes is completely different but mainly
I noticed that my dark circles are just
so much lighter it really blew me away
and I like the fact that it's
lightweight it kind of sinks in almost
immediately I don't feel like greasy
underneath my eyes at all recommend this
I loved keels I have been really into
some new skincare lately and I feel like
my skin has been looking pretty good
because of it so if you want me to do an
updated like current skincare obsessions
then I will definitely do that okay so I
have a lot of products and I feel like
I'm already really far into this video
so I'm going to try to speed it up so I
want to talk about a single eye shadow
and this is the eye shadow that was all
over my entire lid um in my recent
favorites my February favorites and it's
Bobbi Brown's eyeshadow in camel and
this is what it looks like as you can
see it's pretty much amazing looks like
like baby poop and I love that I got
this out of CCO I went to a CCO when I
was down in Orlando or up in Orlando now
I should say and I saw that there was a
CCO in the
let's of the Premium Outlets in Orlando
and I went looking for heatwave for me
and Laura and I couldn't find heatwave
so I stumbled across this and when I saw
it at the CCO I thought oh my god does
that mean that this is discontinued and
turns out it is but I bought it anyway
because it is so incredibly beautiful
and it was discounted and I wear this
all the time like I always have this on
my eyelids now it's actually what's in
my crease I have this and Mac's texture
just thrown in my crease and that's
pretty much all I have on my eyes it's
beautiful because it's not a typical
Brown it's very warm very like yellow
and I love this because it is
discontinued I cut it kind of sucks that
I don't want to really talk about it but
Mac's
uninterupted is pretty much an exact
dupe for this and that's permanent and
it's available so if you're looking for
a color similar to this I would
definitely go for Mac's uninterrupted I
am loving this color I have worn this
blush like four times this month and
that's saying a lot since I have pretty
much a lot of bushes it's the NYX HD
blush in soft spoken this one they look
like NYX came out with a bunch of new
blushes in this little packaging with a
little bow it's their new HD blushes and
I really love this one and soft spoken
it's such a beautiful light peach I like
that the pigmentation isn't crazy or
over-the-top those blushes that I barely
tapped my brush in and then I have like
a big giant pink circle on my face they
drive me crazy I like ones that I can
build up slowly and I feel like this
gives me that it doesn't mean it's not
pigmented because it's very pigmented
but I like that it's soft okay so I'm
going to talk about complexion products
I feel like I've been loving a lot of
face things I don't know what's up with
the jazz hands but anyway these are the
cover FX custom cover drops and I've
been using this a ton I have my ng 30
and these are this is basically pure
pigments like in a little bottle it
comes with a dropper mine is a little
bit
ready because I have been using it
non-stop it's like a serum II texture
but they're pretty much like pure
pigments this is supposed to be made to
use with skin care um like a moisturizer
a primer or whatever just to give more
coverage you can mix this in with other
foundations to get more coverage a BB
cream and stuff like that it's pretty
much to add that kick of coverage to
your look but I like using it by itself
I've used it with moisturizer and I
really like how it looks with
moisturizer but I really like how it
looks by itself it's crazy 100% full-on
coverage and you're not supposed to use
it by itself but I don't care rules
there are no rules
that's from Greece right like when
they're about to race he's about to race
that guy like in the black car and that
guys like rules there are no rules first
back and forth from the something wins
what I don't know anyway my point is I
really like these new cover FX custom
cover drops and I actually really like
it mixed with my Bourjois healthy mix
serum this is my favorite drugstore
foundation besides the Revlon Colorstay
like when I want a fresh face and
actually like how this matches together
because it gives it more coverage
because this is more like a light fresh
buildable medium coverage foundation and
this just makes it that full-on coverage
with that light feel I got that Bourjois
healthy mix serum on Amazon by the way I
think it was like $15 a musher so my
next product is another foundation that
I've had for a while but I just recently
started to see how freakin fabulous this
foundation is and it is the make up
forever face and body liquid makeup this
is the foundation I have on my face
right now I only wear it when I'm
self-tanning because it is my
self-tanning shade this is just like the
Mac face and body foundation if you used
that before the Mac one used to be my
favorite like Holy Grail foundation for
about two months and then I started
noticing that
giving me these weird white bumps
underneath my skin so I had to stop
using it which sucks because this is
like 80% water you would think it
wouldn't break me out but every single
Mac foundation touches my skin and I
break out this one thankfully did not
break me out and I and I think that it
might be even better than the Mac one
this is a very very light coverage
watery consistency like I said it's like
70% water but it has buildable coverage
believe it or not this is bigger than
your average foundation an average
foundation has like about one fluid
ounce
this has 1.69 so I think they make it
bigger because you do use more when I
just want to even out my skin tone I use
about two pumps when I want more
coverage I use about four pumps because
two problems is really really light like
on the skin it's just basically going to
even out your skin tone and when I like
to build it up to give myself just a
little bit more coverage I use like four
pumps so I use like four bumps on my
face today and even though I don't have
problematic skin or a lot of acne on my
face I feel like this leaves my face
flawless like just airbrushed and so
beautiful and I don't think I have any
foundation that leaves my skin as
beautiful as this I think I might even
like this one more than my makeup
forever HD foundation which is my
favorite high-end foundation ever I
don't know which one I like more at this
point this one photographs really well
and it actually super long wearing it's
waterproof or like water-resistant I
love the finish so freakin much the only
negative honestly I love everything
about it the only negative is this
smells so freakin strong like I don't
even like paint but like strong strong
paint but it even linkers on my face
while I'm applying it but as soon as it
I'm done with the rest of my makeup like
I can't smell it anymore but that
initial application with that smell it
just drives me freaking nuts but I can
look past that because it's freaking
amazing I bought it on Sephora calm and
I'm so happy because I love it so my
next favorite is a powder and I don't
really talk about powder because since
my skin is so dry I freakin hate powders
but I really really really love this one
this is the bourgeois healthy balance
ten hours matte
a natural healthy glow powder I have
mine in 53 beige Claire and this is what
it looks like I really really love this
powder even though it says matte on the
front it's such a silky texture that it
doesn't feel cakey on my face it doesn't
look cakey on my face it almost feels
creamy to the touch like literally
creamy I love it and I'm pretty sure
like overseas it's very inexpensive and
I'm pretty sure you can get this like at
the drugstore like in the UK a viewer
actually sent me this so I'm very very
grateful thank you normal because I
really love it and I can't get it in the
States so while I was in California for
IMAX I stumbled upon a store that said
the body shop on it and I was really
excited because they sold makeup and I
had never seen any of the body shop
makeup so I picked up this bronzer this
is the bronzing powder in the shade
light matte 0-1 and I really loved it
quickly has become one of my top five
favorite matte bronzers because it looks
so natural on the skin if you have a
very fair skin like a very very fair
skin I think you would really like this
up until like light medium skin tones
dark skin tones will not benefit from
this because it is so light but I find
that fair skin has a hard time finding
good bronzers for them that don't make
them look muddy or they are too dark and
this one is a good one it kind of has
like a pinky undertone I don't know how
to explain it but it just looks so
natural and sunkissed on the skin I'm
wearing just a little bit of this on my
cheeks I actually have the Too Faced
cocoa contour kit on my face and then I
just put a little bit of this on my
cheeks
it's very silky it is the most blendable
runs are ever so easy to use and I just
think it's a really good one just for a
second I'm going to jump over to here I
purchased this at my necks and um it's
freaking amazing this is the matrix by
Lodge hydro so I feel like you can't
talk as my nose is so stuffy hide your
source daily leave in tonic for dry hair
this is basically a leave-in treatment
like a leavin spray and I really like it
it's not a cream form I use a lot of
like leave-in conditioners on my hair
that are like a creamy consistency and
this is more like a like a liquid I
don't know but I have been using this in
my hair every time I wash it I'll just
spray this all over my hair and this
makes my hair so incredibly soft that it
literally shocked me the first time I
used this it has aloe in it and it's
just it makes my hair really really soft
which is the big thing for me since my
hair is pretty freakin damaged I like it
to feel soft and this makes it feel soft
to lip products I want to mention the
first is the NYX high voltage lipstick
in the shade stone this lipstick is so
unique and so pretty it's a very very
cool toned nude it has like a beige e
gray undertone really really gorgeous I
know that that sounds weird I use this
lipstick in my like purple and taupe
makeup tutorial and I love how it is how
it looks
it's very glossy very pretty I recommend
all the high voltage lipsticks they're
actually really good
they last a decent amount of time on my
lips and they're cheap and really good
like I just say it another lipstick I
want to talk about is the lipstick I'm
wearing right now these are my favorite
colors to put on my mouth I love orange
reds like those red lipsticks that have
that orange undertone they are my
favorite to wear that's why I can never
like I could like I'm always like like
this waiting for spring and summer
because I love red lips red lipsticks
are my favorite lipsticks to wear
especially orange ones and this one is
so amazing this is craving coral it's
from the matte collection from
Maybelline you guys know that this matte
collection is like my life and this one
in craving coral is beautiful it's so
vibrant so pretty very pigmented and I
just love how it wears I love how it
looks it doesn't bleed these lipsticks
are freaking fabulous and this one is
definitely going to be a go-to for me
especially in the spring and summertime
oh look like I flipped you off there for
a second I'm sorry I want to talk about
a nail polish really quick now I've only
had this
nail polish for like about a week but I
mean I'm kind of cheating because it's
only been a week but this nail polish is
at the top for me at the freakin top I
love this Polish so much that if I could
choose my top five favorite polishes of
all time this one would land into that
this is the ZOA nail polish in the shade
Miley money and Atheneum polish I'm
wearing on my fingers right now I saw
this nail polish actually it's funny
story actually it's not funny at all I
was scrolling through Pinterest this is
how I squirrel through Pinterest I was
scrolling through Pinterest and I saw
somebody's nails like this and I was
like oh my god that color is absolutely
beautiful and I saw that in the
description it says Zoe Miley so I
immediately went on to the soil website
and I purchased it and it got here and
it was just as beautiful as it was on
Pinterest which rarely happens it is one
of those formulas that isn't a cream
like it's a gel like a jelly consistency
which I really love about it because it
honestly looks like I'm wearing a gel
medic ER because it's so shiny but you
do the first coat you're like oh my god
this is awful this is gonna be a
freaking disaster because it is kind of
sheer but then when you put on that
second coat it's such a beautiful finish
it is still just like a little bit sheer
but that's what I love about it I think
it's so feminine and so sweet and soft
and I love these lavender lilac colors
but this one is just special out of all
like my light purple colors this one is
freakin special I highly recommend it
so much okay so I quickly want to talk
about two Etsy shops and then I can wrap
this video up this video is literally
like 30 minutes long ok so I have gotten
so many questions about my phone case
