my March favorites these are products
I've been loving in the month of March
to be honest I don't really have that
many products because I haven't been
using makeup all that much this month I
definitely have I definitely have but
not as much as usual I've been thinking
there's just been a lot of people over
and I haven't had time for myself and
for my makeup this video still will be
long
you already know my nose is still a
little bit stuffy and I kind of caught
from Tom - Tom - Tom I cut off from Tom
- Tom but I'm feeling a lot better like
I don't even feel sick anymore it's just
still like lingering here with that
being said I'm so sorry that there's
been a lack of videos on my channel it's
been like two weeks I mean I haven't
I've posted videos within these two
weeks but so many things have been
happening and when I went to go film a
video for Wednesday my power went out
and I couldn't use my lights because
there was a huge storm and hopefully
things are back to normal from now on so
I'm so sorry about that lack of videos
but without further ado let's get
started on the products I loved last
month I want to give a quick mention to
these guys right here these are the
Kleenex fresh on-the-go wipes and a
friend of mine actually sent me a couple
of these and I fell in love with them
these are not makeup wipes they're just
simply wipes I don't even know how to
explain them they feel I have one here
that's almost dry but they are like
actual towels like do you hear that
they're not going to rip like a regular
makeup wipe they have like a towel wooly
feeling and my favorite way to use this
is to like wipe down my vanity if makeup
gets all over my vanity like it usually
does I will get this and I will just
wipe down my makeup I'll keep these in
my purse and kind of just like clean my
hands throughout the day they honestly
feel like water I don't know what the
ingredients are in this because it's
pretty much water to me they were a gift
so I don't exactly know where you can
get them but I'm pretty sure I've seen
these at Target so or anywhere that they
sell Kleenex these are just really great
on-the-go wipes not to remove your
makeup because they aren't really like
makeup remover but for pretty much
anything else this is the product that
completely blew me away this month's is
from the brand Dermalogica
and this is their pre cleanse basically
you've seen this product before I'm sure
a product very similar it's kind of like
an oil that you use to take off all your
makeup it's like a cleanse off oil Mac
has one Clinic has one
there's a ton of brands and honestly out
of all the ones I've used this one is
the best
I honestly gave away all of my cleanse
off oils once I tried this one for the
first time basically you just apply this
to your dry face so if you have like a
full face of makeup on you go to your
sink you pump like three pumps into your
hands and you start to massage this on
dry face and the oil just really does a
great job of breaking down your makeup
like everything everything it gets off
your makeup so well I almost don't feel
the need to wash my face after I do but
I almost don't feel the need to wash my
face after because every trace of makeup
comes off and it doesn't leave my skin
feeling oily so many cleansed off oils
when you're done taking off your makeup
you're like oh my gosh I need to wash my
face immediately because my face is
really oily not this it almost it's
magic I don't know what it is but it's
magic okay so a concealer I've
completely fallen in love with this
month I really haven't used any other
concealer since I've been trying this
out and I keep going back to it I think
it's so great this is the Catrice liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer this
is a waterproof concealer I bought mine
at Ulta this was like three dollars guys
this is the Catrice brand I think it's
like a German brand mmm I could be
making that up but I have mine in the
shade light beige this is the concealer
I'm wearing underneath my eyes right now
this has amazing coverage like really
great coverage and what I love about it
is it has high coverage but it's not
cakey it's not thick and it's so easy to
blend guys like I put this underneath my
eyes and I just blend it out so
effortlessly it's awesome the only thing
I will say is that the scent is so
strong oh my god she smells so strong of
like baby powder I think but I love it
so much that I just looked past that it
doesn't linger like I don't smell it on
my face throughout the day okay so I
want to give a quick mention to this
little brush right here because every
time I use it in a video I get tons of
comments asking what did you highlight
your face with I have been using this
brush to highlight non-stop I think I
think this is my favorite highlighting
brush I really also love the morphe m3
10 very affordable really great fan
brush for highlighting but I just I love
this brush this is the zoeva 134 luxe
powder fusion brush I feel like it's the
perfect shape the perfect size to
highlight my cheekbones
it tapers really nicely it's a very soft
brush I just love everything about it it
washes really well I've never had any
shedding and I just find that it fits on
everything it's just amazing to
highlight with and I highly recommend it
my god I have found my favorite lip balm
of all time so recently I put in a
glossier order and I posted a picture on
Instagram of new products I bought from
glossier because I've heard so much hype
about it I've heard a lot of people
talking about this brand recently so I
wanted to test it out I'm still testing
out a bunch of the products from the
line and I like a lot of them but oh my
gosh this is amazing this is the
glossier bomb.com universal skin cell I
have been using this every single night
every single night before I go to bed
and when I wake up my lips feel like a
million dollars my lips just aren't
chapped anymore and I've used a ton of
lip balms this is very similar to aqua
for in the sense that it's kind of like
that petroleum type of feeling but it
does more than just Vaseline like I
could slather on the Vaseline at night
and on my lips and when I wake up they
feel hydrated but not like this this is
like special I don't know it makes my
lips feel like nothing else I also
picked up the coconut version it's the
coconut balm calm and this one I used
the original I use every single night
right before bed and then this one I'm
loving using this underneath lipsticks
like when you smell the coconut one it
doesn't smell like artificial coconuts
it almost feels like they smashed up
some coconuts and put it in this lovely
glass a bomb calm I highly recommend it
if you're looking for a lip balm and
your lips are always chapped and this is
the perfect like overnight mask for your
lips
okay so I've mentioned these in a
favorites video before a few months ago
but I have to talk about them again
because recently it's like these are all
I've been using and I'm talking about
the color pop cream gel liners the color
pop eyeliners they are so good again
they're just so freakin amazing
these are $5 eyeliners and they're
better than 98% of my eyeliners that are
sitting in my drawer right now Mac like
a bunch of brands these color pop ones
oh my gosh they they smoke them
alright so affordable and you get the
best color payoff ever
ever I was wearing this one in my
waterline the other day and it lasted
like 12 hours it did not leave my
waterline this is the shade puppy it's
like a neon orange and yesterday
actually I was wearing this one this is
their new color for their spring lunch
it's called tea spoon and I was wearing
this in my waterline is so funny I was
wearing this and then I took off all my
makeup just like with a wipe I took off
all my makeup and then Melissa came over
you guys know Melissa from my no mirror
makeup challenge she came over and she
was like why your island are so pretty
it's like a beautiful like green teal
I'm like my eyeliner still on I just
took off all my makeup these stay on and
they last all day they glide
effortlessly and you don't have to
sharpen them because they are twists up
oh my god there's nothing nothing
negative I have to say about these I'm
actually wearing this one on my
waterline right now this is in the shade
overboard it's like a really pretty
bronzy brown okay so my next favorite is
this bad boy right here I have been
using this non-stop I saw youtuber use
this in a video and I loved it so much
that I went on to the Nordstrom website
and I purchased it and I haven't put it
down this is actually a duo this is the
NARS duo in Laguna and hot sand this is
actually a limited edition product so if
you want it go to Nordstrom and pick it
up because it's limited edition I don't
exactly know how long it's going to be
available and the bronzer I knew I was
going to love because Laguna is one of
my favorite bronzers of all time I'm
wearing Laguna right now and this is the
highlight I'm wearing on my face this is
in the shade hot sands like I just said
but this is the highlight on my
cheekbones and I didn't think I was
gonna love this as much as I do because
I don't like Nora's highlights albatross
I don't like it people love it I don't
like I've never liked a highlight from
NARS and I also didn't think I would
like this one because it's so subtle but
that is what I love about this if you
are someone who you want to highlight
but you're not into that metallic
highlight like oh I look like Jennifer
Lopez and boom you can see my highlight
from space if you're not into all of
that which I totally understand you
might really love hot stands it is a
pinky or highlight so if you're not into
like the pinky like a peachy shades you
might not like this but it's just so
soft on the cheeks and it just catches
the light very slightly I'm loving
loving loving this tool that I even
bought it back up because I know I'm
going to hit pan
soon I haven't put it down I've been
wearing it every day but another
highlight I do want to mention because
it's so stunning and this one is a
metallic BAM whoa highlight in your face
which I do love as well this is from
makeup revolution this is a very very
very affordable brand I think this was
like around five dollars this is their
shimmer brick in the shade radiant this
is beautiful my favorite way to use this
is kind of like swirling the first four
colors right here I don't touch that
last one because it's very bronzy and
very dark that's probably a really
pretty eye shadow but I just did my
brush into these little squares right
here and it gives you the most beautiful
glow it's so like stunning it's very
intense on the cheeks I feel like on the
cheeks it's even more intense than what
it looks like in a swatch but when you
feel like Jennifer Lopez and you feel
like today I'm gonna glow pick this up
because it's so affordable and it's
really great quality I bought it on the
makeup revolution website I want to give
a quick shout out to these because I
haven't used these a ton but every time
I've used this I've fallen in love these
are the Jordana made to last
liquid eyeshadows these are pretty new I
bought mine at Walgreens guys these are
so good you need to go to your local
Walgreens and pick these up if you find
them they are a delicious cream shadow
that sets really well really beautiful I
really love wearing this one this is the
one I've worn the most this is a not a
wink pink it's like a rose gold shade he
just blend really nicely and they set
and they last all day so inexpensive
like they were like two dollars each I
believe if you don't want to put too
much effort into your eyeshadow look you
just grab this it has a doe foot
applicator take it out rub it on your
eyelids then you tap it with your finger
and blend it out and you have like a one
shadow look but it looks so like
beautiful and shimmery and glowy
I love these liquid eye shadow okay
something that isn't so affordable but
I've just I've been loving so much I've
had this for a really long time and now
is when I feel like I'm really using it
this is the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in the shade luminous light I
didn't really use this when I first got
it all that much I initially thought I
was going to use it like as a highlight
that's why I didn't really grab this
that much because it's so subtle but
I've been using it as a face powder I
don't set my
with this but as kind of like a veil of
powder on top of my foundation like I'll
set my foundation with my bye-bye pores
from a cosmetics or my RC MA no color
powder i'll set my entire face and then
if i look like a little flat if i don't
look as glowy as i like to look i'll
just take a brush like this this is the
morphe e41
amazing for this like amazing i love
this it's amazing so big and I'll just
tap it into this product like I'll add
some now cuz I haven't added some today
I don't know if you could tell can you
tell I'll just dust this on my whole
face and my neck and my body and my
shoulders and my arms I will just dust
this everywhere I could really see it in
person it just adds a beautiful soft
kind of like veil Sheen to the skin
they're so pricey but if you find one
that really works for you I think that
they are worth it my last favorite is a
blush and it is from the brand Rimmel I
bought this blush on Amazon because I
couldn't find it anywhere in store so I
had to get mine on Amazon which makes me
believe that this product like isn't
available anymore but you can still get
it on Amazon this is in the shade santa
Rose it's their lasting finish soft
color blush and I'm obsessed with this
this is the blush I'm wearing on my face
right now it gives you like a soft
peachy pink glow but it's not shimmery
it's like a matte blush that has a
little bit of a sheen to it so beautiful
Santa Rosa has got to be like one of my
new favorite blushes ever ever perfect
for the spring and it just gives your
cheeks a little bit of a flush very
affordable it's Rimmel and even on
Amazon I didn't pay a lot for this I
just love it so much I highly recommend
it if you are into these kinds of like
peachy pink colors I definitely
recommend you check this out okay guys
