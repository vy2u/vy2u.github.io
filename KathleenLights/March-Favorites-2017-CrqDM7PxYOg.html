my March favorites we're going to talk
about all of the beauty products I was
loving in the month of March if you hear
an echo I took off the rug that was in
this room so I apologize if that's
annoying I'm in the process of redoing
my beauty room so I got rid of my rug
and I purchased a new one but my new one
hasn't gotten here yet so please if you
hear an echo I'm not sure if you can I
can hear the echoes but if you can and
sorry also another thing I want to
mention before I go ahead and get
started on this video I know there
wasn't a video up on Monday and I spoke
about this on Twitter very briefly but
I'm just kind of dealing with something
right now it's not something that's too
crazy or anything for you guys to worry
about and I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to get you guys worried for
no reason I know I'm not making any
sense right now I'm just dealing with
some personal things in terms of my
health nothing too crazy I'm fine just
some things I have to take care of and
they have just been consuming my
thoughts every single day I've had
really bad anxiety but I am fine thank
you so much for your sweet tweet
everything is okay and yeah let's talk
about other products I've really really
been loving and the first thing I want
to talk about is something I have been
loving so much I am so incredibly
obsessed with this and honestly I
haven't even been using it for that long
because I just recently got it but I
love it so much I have to talk about it
today so this is the Marc Jacobs
fantastic Omega bronzer and I really
wanted to talk about it quickly because
this is limited edition I'm not exactly
sure how long this is going to be
available and I think that's up because
I saw friends mode if you follow that
Instagram accounts trend mood is always
posting like brand new releases when
products are going to come out all that
stuff so I saw that she posted a picture
of this and said it was available on the
markups website so I went immediately
and I purchased it but I think it was
only available for a couple of days or
something like that but now I believe it
is officially out I think that was kind
of like a pre-launch but anyway I picked
it up and wow I am obsessed with this
and I didn't think I was going to like
it as much as I do because I have the
original Marc Jacobs bronze reticence be
permanent Omega bronzer this is in the
shade 10 trick I don't really like this
I bought this because many raisins about
this and I love money but
I don't love this I think if for my skin
tone it's a little bit too warm and you
can see it here compared to tantastic
yeah fantastic this one is a little bit
more cool tone and I find that this
works a lot better on my skin I
absolutely love this while this one is
just it's not my favorite some of
everything about this I love the mirror
I have a huge mirror such good quality
you get a really big pan you get a lot
of product with this bronzer it has 25
grams which is a lot more than a
standard typical bronzer so yes this is
an incredibly pricy bronzer I believe
this is like $50 status but that's
expensive for a bronzer but you do get a
lot of product so if you break it down
by that it's not terrible but anyway
besides that I love the packaging I just
love everything about this it even
smells like coconuts however as I
mentioned that it's part of their whole
coconut collection they recently came
out with this the coconut settings for
at this mini one because they gave it to
me as a sample from Sephora they also
came out with their bronzer brush which
is just like their original bronzer
brush only this one is in the limited
edition packaging so I also purchased
this when I bought this I do get er from
Marc Jacobs but I purchased all of this
myself I just couldn't help it I'm
obsessed with anything coconut anything
that seemed around coconut and summery
and white packaging I just I fell in
love but anyway oh my gosh I've been
talking about this for like five hours I
think this is the standout product out
of this collection the bronzer I'm
wearing on my face today and I just feel
like it gives you such a beautiful tan
in a non orange way it's so beautiful
but it's not ashy or too cool tone I
love it I love the undertone in this and
the scent just gets me every time this
is going to be my go-to bronzer for
spring and summer I already see it
happening I will say though that the
perfecting coconut setting this sucks I
know that seems really harsh but the
spray sucks like it just it just spits
at you it spits like little dots of oil
all over your face and then you stay
with those like oily dots on your eyes I
do not like this I'll probably go into
more detail in a future disappointing
products but I would not recommend this
so the next guy I want to talk about is
this this is the elf prep and hydrate
bomb I was trying to get my
Somnath forever on the out website but
it was sold out and then L kindly sent
it to me so thank you so much else I
love this this is actually really good
at first it's do me off because I'm not
used to putting on a primer like this
this is just a bomb stick you just roll
it up and then you know the stick comes
out pretty self-explanatory it says it's
a clear cooling balm that helps hydrate
and prep the skin for makeup application
enriched with purified water shade and
vitamin E to help nourish and moisturize
I wouldn't necessarily consider this
like super moisturizing and super
hydrating for me I always go to the
Bekaa first light priming filter
whenever I want like some hydration but
then this is different I don't know how
to explain it sometimes around my mouth
I get very dry or in my t-zone my t-zone
is the driest area on my face and
whenever I smooth this over my skin it
like absorbs my dry patches I love this
I apply this to my entire face I'll just
like paint it everywhere and then I'll
just go on top and blend it out with my
fingers to really push it into the skin
it also works really well with other
primers to put this on your face and
then go in with another primer and I
don't feel like this disturbs the other
primer it's so good and I highly
recommend it I want to give a shout out
to the LC minimalist palette because
it's so it's so nice I have a story
using this palette where I did two looks
in one I'm going to link that tutorial
down below just in case you want to see
this bad boy in action but I love this
it's just so practical I have been
reaching for this almost every time I
put on eyeshadow because I have
everything I want I use this color is
send down my primer all the time this is
the perfect crease shade and then I
always use the black as an eyeliner and
the brown on the outer corners the one
that I don't use as often is this
reddish shade which is weird because I
love those tones but on a daily basis I
always always use shades like this and
yes I have a million eyes shadows that
look just like this whether there are in
singles or in other palettes but I love
that this is so small I had all your
basic shades it's so easy to travel with
and have a great mirror it's just
everything I want and the quality is
there this black is so black it reminds
me a lot of makeup geeks corrupt or
Urban Decay blackout I'm actually
wearing all of these shades on my eyes
right now except this one but I also
have this palette on my eyes today this
is the morphe 35o are i was just testing
it out for the first time today because
it was just recently sent to me i have
this golden color all over my entire lid
and then I have this shade in my crease
and this underneath my brow bone but the
rest of the eyeshadows on my eyes are
from this palette I really recommend it
especially if you are a minimalist
yourself I think you will really like
this
so if you keep up with color pop you
would have known that they have been
recently coming out with so many
different limited-edition collections
they had an extra one I did a whole
video on that and they recently came out
with a pink one and a sand one and
unfortunately it's all limited edition
which are you hate that because I have
been obsessed with this this is
definitely my favorite thing that has
come out out of all three collections
this is one of their face jewels that
has a blush and a highlight and this is
the one in double play like I said they
have two other ones but double play is
my favorite I love this I'm wearing this
blush on my cheeks right now when I
posted a picture of this on Instagram a
lot of you guys were wondering if this
could be used as a bronzer and maybe
depending on your skin tone but for me
it's more of like a peachy bronze blush
I love I love it so much I love the
color I love everything about this blush
I think it's going to be so nice in the
summertime especially I just I love the
color I'm also wearing this highlight on
my face right now which is also stunning
it's also my favorite highlight they've
come out with out of the three of course
it's just so so beautiful it's the one
that matches my skin tone the most to me
it's the perfect blush and the perfect
highlight and they just go so well
together um I really wish they would
just like make this one permanent it
would be awesome I have nothing negative
to say about it besides the fact that
the name aren't on the actual packaging
that drives me crazy I want to talk
about the new equal tools
sponge because it is quickly becoming
one of my favorite sponges at the
drugstore I think I even like this one
more than the Real Techniques one which
is crazy
their original orange one was my
favorite at the drugstore but now now I
I think I like this one look I love the
shape of this guy
it's round at the bottom like a Beauty
Blender which I love it's a little dirty
because I used it today to throw my
foundation and here at the
it's completely flat and at first that
threw me off because I thought okay I
can never blend out my under-eye
concealer with this but you totally can
you can even turn it on its side right
here and you've got a pointy side like a
Beauty Blender and you could just use
that pointy side to blend out your
concealer but what I really love about
this is that you can also bake with this
I spoke about a baking sponge in a
previous favourites video but ever since
I got this I don't use that one anymore
because this has a flat edge and I could
bake with it just like I could bake with
that Vera Moda one so I feel like this
is a sponge of many traits it can do it
all pretty much I just love it it's so
squishy it applies my foundation really
nicely and it's so easy to just like I
purchased mine online either at Target
or at Ulta but I'm pretty sure it's in
stores and it's pretty affordable it's
only like nine dollars and it comes with
another sponge so you get like a dual
the other one is just a little bit
smaller which is perfect for like cream
bronzer or cream blush or even like
liquid highlight nine dollars for two
sponges that's pretty freakin good
considering this is very similar to the
Beauty Blender so yes I give this an A
plus plus plus less less less the winner
Maya's photo focus concealer is not a
concealer I have been using for that
long since I tried it for the very first
time the other day in a video but I'm
obsessed with this I haven't used it
every day since that video and I loved
it so much I can't believe I didn't want
to give it a shot earlier I had read a
lot of negative reviews about this
concealer which is a little weird
because I find it to be so nice I think
what I love about this the most is its
blend ability it blends so easily I
don't think I have a concealer blends
this effortlessly you put it underneath
your eyes and you tap your sponge like
three times and boom it's blended onto
the skin the only thing that kind of
sucks is that it's not super full
coverage but I'm okay with that because
it just blends so nicely onto the skin
that is really easy to build like I
haven't underneath my eyes today I'm
that second layer just added a little
bit more coverage and it looked nice and
smooth it wasn't cakey or crazy it's
just a really great concealer and it is
quickly becoming one of my favorite
drugstore concealers okay so let's talk
about some lip products and then we can
go into a couple hair products this has
been my everything
entire month if I could only choose one
favorite of the month like one it would
be this this is the bareMinerals
Jen nude butter cream lip gloss in the
shade
groovy now I've had this sitting in my
collection since bareMinerals sent me
their lip glosses and I never really
played around with this color until I
saw a hole I said that weird a hall by
Jacqueline's no she did like a Sephora
ha and she purchased this shade and then
she put it on in the video and I was
like blown away by how beautiful it
looked so I ran to my Beauty room and
looked through my lip glosses and I
found it and I have been wearing it ever
since I saw that video I wore this in my
last video I wore this in the video
before that with Amelia
I even wore this to the World Baseball
Classic
it was USA versus Dominican Republic and
I wore this lipgloss to the game and it
stayed on my mouth the entire game this
is the only thing I were on my lips and
throughout the entire game like I felt
it it was it was on my lips and it
stayed intact yes the gloss didn't fade
like the sheen to my lips did fade
pretty quickly but this color was pretty
much there I've been wearing this lip
color for a few hours now so it's
starting to lose its shine let me just
add a little mo I love this the key is
to not apply too much so there are a
couple things I don't like let me
explain if you apply too much of this it
will get goopy and you'll get that weird
line in the you know inside your mouth
if you apply too much that will
definitely happen but a little bit goes
a very long way with this gloss it is
extremely pigmented it is nothing like
buxom White Russian do you guys know
that's my all-time favorite lip gloss
that one is a little bit sheer and more
like glossy this one is a little
creamier and it's much much more
pigmented but I just love how fake it is
and it gives like full colorful coverage
and I love the color it's very very nude
it's almost like washes out your lips
but I kind of like that and I feel like
it pairs really well with a ton of
different lip liners I just I love this
i love it on top of lipstick i love it
completely on its own okay so this next
one makes me laugh so hard because a lot
of you hate it this is the LA girl matte
flat finish pigment gloss in the shade
instinct i recently spoke about this in
an underrated makeup product video
and now I could totally see why this is
underrated it's a lot of people told
like this and I can totally see why
people don't like this there's a liquid
lipstick and it's a very dry liquid
lipstick I probably should have
mentioned that in that video when they
say matte they are not kidding these
when you apply them to your lips they
dry almost instantly and they stay
completely matte for the entire day but
I kind of like that especially with this
color because it's not streaky or patchy
there are a ton of colors in the range
that I actually don't like I mentioned
that in the video some of these have a
terrible terrible formula I only truly
love four of them this is one of my
favorites is not my favorite red orange
liquid lipstick it just lasts all
freaking day and these are my favorite
colors to wear on my lips and I was
actually thinking about that the other
day I was like man red orange is always
like my go-to lip color if I have to
wear a lip color for the rest of my life
eats well it wouldn't know because it
really wouldn't match with anything I
would probably wear a nude but if I had
to wear a bold lip color for the rest of
my life it would be a red orange and
then I started thinking like I can't
believe I've never created that with any
of my collab I've never really created a
red orange except Miami fever but that
one is more of a burnt red orange this
is like a neon summer red orange which
are my favorite can't believe we've
never created one that's crazy but
anyway I really have been wearing this
so much like all month whenever I've
been wanting to pop on a red orange I've
been wearing this every time the warmer
months come around I mean it's always
warm in Miami but you know what I mean I
have been going for this color I just
love this tone I'm actually thinking
about doing an entire video let me know
if it's stupid I want to do a whole
video dedicated to my favorite hot
orange red lipsticks like an all
finishes juicy one Matt was glossy one
let me know if that's something you
would be interested in because that's my
favorite lip color but I don't know if
people really like that color so leave
me a comment down below if that's a
video you would like to watch I would
obviously put them all on my lips and
show you like lip swatches and stuff but
yeah I have been loving this so much
okay and then the elastic products I
want to talk about are these bad boys
these are the Tarte Color Splash
lipsticks and I really really love these
like a lot I was I purchased all four of
these myself
and I will say that the only reason
I purchased these was because of this
packaging look at this package you look
at this one there's not a lot of like
the blue right there honestly I don't
know what it is about these lipsticks
but in my opinion these are the most
beautiful lipsticks I have ever seen in
my life just like looking at them I love
that it's marble and I love that it's
blue marble it's so summery and fun
luckily I really love the formula too
these are the two that I use the most
pink lemonade which is a really pretty
peachy nude and then I wear this one a
lot too this is beach babe I wear beach
babe a lot more as you could tell beach
babe is definitely my favorite it's the
one I'm wearing underneath my lip gloss
right now I just tapped a little bit of
this on and then I applied the lip gloss
because I feel like that lip gloss
applies better with a thin layer of
lipstick underneath but I really do like
this formula I'm pretty mad that they
aren't chalky or anything they aren't -
a mask sometimes not everybody likes
liquid lipsticks but they still want a
matte lipstick and I highly highly
recommend these especially because a lot
of nude liquid lipsticks get really
crusty on the inside of your mouth and I
find that these do not do that to me and
I have to spend wearing these a lot pink
lemonade is nice but sometimes I don't
want peach undertone this just goes with
everything okay so my last two favorites
are hair products this is hair pause
number one this is the l'oreal air-dry
it
Ruff's body moves heat freestyle frizz
resistant I'm actually not wearing this
in my hair today because I decided to
just let my hair do its thing today I
don't have any mousse in it but I have
been loving this mousse I do think it's
frizz resistant it keeps a nice hold on
my hair it says it has a strong hold for
waves and curls and I find that to be
the case but it isn't crunchy or sticky
at first when you are applying this to
your hair you're like oh my gosh my
hands feel sticky my hair feels sticky
things are getting weird but once it
completely dries and like sets in your
hair you don't feel it you could run
your hands through it and it just feels
really really nice I love it I think it
really does a nice job of keeping my
curls nice and curly and my favorite
thing about this mousse is the scent
this has such a beautiful scent I can't
even tell you what it smells like
because I don't know it just smells
beautiful and it makes my hair smell
that way for the entire day like I have
people tell me oh my gosh your hair
smells really good whenever I have this
moves on I just can't get enough of this
scent whenever anything it makes me
smell good I love it so much but besides
the amazing scent the product is really
nice as well and then my last favorite
is something that I feel like I will
never not use this is the marula
intensive hair treatment and styling oil
this has been a freaking godsend for my
hair it looks like I've only used very
little I'm like down to right here it
looks like I've barely touched this but
I have been using it all freakin month
granted I wash my hair like every four
days but I also put this in my hair
throughout the week so I don't only use
it when I wash my hair and I feel like
it's barely made a dent in it but a
little goes such a long way with this
product it's definitely something you
have to be careful with if you use very
little and you evenly distribute it
throughout your entire hair it makes
your hair so shiny and so obtained like
so paint whenever I feel like okay my
hair is really really frizzy like this
really bad I'll just put a little bit of
this rub it in my hands and put it
throughout my entire hair and it just
takes away frizz instantly it gives my
hair beautiful shine I just I have
nothing negative to say about this it's
silicone free color safe and it tames
frizz and repairs strand it says it's
for coarse curly or thick hair so if you
have very thin hair but you still want
to use it like I said use very little I
have a lot of hair but I have thin hair
and I still find that this works for me
so well it is my baby it is my little
baby hey guys so that can be this video
leave me a comment down below your
favorite products in March was and if I
haven't tried it before
I will definitely check it out but yeah
thank you guys for always being so
supportive and loving and accepting

a moment thank you so much for just
being so kind all the time I am wearing
the kale polish nail polish in the shade

my spring polishes will be coming very
soon they will be releasing in April

factors and so many things yeah

put on Z go boy like I said they have to
how I teach primer I just I just I
really like this idea I also don't know
why about this because I don't really
love the original bronzer brush and this
is legit the exact same brush only on
white
why does packaging suck me in so bad
it's ridiculous
I don't think this is worth the money
also like so expensive for a brush</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
