my March favorites March I feel like I
said that weird ever since I got
Invisalign and I take them out it's like
I don't know how to speak it's almost
like I talk better with them on because
when they're not on I'm like my tongue
is like dancing everywhere I don't know
what Zoo anyway today's video I'm gonna
be talking about all of my favorite
products from the month of March and I
have so many products to share with you
guys this month I don't know what it is
I was using so much makeup this month
trying out new things different
techniques yeah yeah yeah I have a lot
to talk about and we already know these
videos cannot be shortened they're all
really long I feel like today's is gonna
be extra long so grab a snake grab some
popcorn and let's get started so I just
quickly want to give a huge shout out to
the ethereal garden collection from kale
polish thank you so much for such an
incredible launch I'm so lucky to have
you guys in my life and thank you thank
you thank you I'm so happy you're loving
the spring collection I love it as well
and I love you so much and that is
totally a favorite of the month and you
know I couldn't not mention it but my
next favorite oh my gosh so this is one
of those things that I was kind of
talking about in my packaging video I'm
obsessed with these I cannot get over
how beautiful these brushes are so these
are brushes from the brand storybook
cosmetics I always want to say
Storybrooke because of once upon a time
but it's storybook cosmetics and they
sell this brand on Ulta I had never
heard of this brand before in my life
but when I saw these brushes online my
jaw dropped I always used to say that if
I ever created makeup brushes this is
how I would do them and then I saw them
on Ulta and I almost cried of happiness
for some reason I don't know what it is
about it but I have like this obsession
with these dry enough little flowers I
actually just purchased this like frame
thing on Urban Outfitters
I had the dried up flowers up against
the glass I'll post a picture of it so
you can see I love the look of little
dried up flowers especially this one
this just looks like a little lavender
stuck in here I'm obsessed with these
they are so incredibly beautiful and I
have been using them non-stop just for
the packaging alone like I've used this
one in my crease over and over again to
apply that initial blown-out color and
I've been using this one for bronzer a
lot and I love it these aren't them
best brushes in the world there are a
little dents and a little too stiff like
I will never use this one it's just a
little too stiff for me I don't love
this one either
again just too stiff and dense but they
are very very very soft so the quality
is really really good and honestly I
just I'm obsessed with this packaging
alright so my next two favorites are
powders and these are powders I've been
using throughout the entire month of
March but I use them both for completely
different reasons the first one is
actually more of a powder foundation and
that is the bare minerals original
powder foundation and I'm in the shade
medium beige this has SPF 15 and I love
this this is an oldie but a goodie I
used to use this so much back in the day
when I first started my channel and then
I kind of got rid of it because it was
really old I never used it again but I
just recently picked it up and I loved
it even more than I used to love it like
it's clacey
my favorite way to use this are on my no
makeup makeup days just because it adds
a little bit of coverage and it makes my
skin look nice and satin a little glowy
but not too much it just looks flawless
on the skin but I like using it on top
of foundation as well like today I am
wearing a foundation that I'm going to
share with you in a little bit but that
I have this all over my face I kind of
use this to set it it has such a
beautiful finish to it it's not matte if
you have very oily skin I don't know if
you would love it but it just gives the
most natural like super super natural
sheen and then this powder
I just recently spoke about but this is
the Becca Hydra mist set and refresh
powder you need this in your life just
for the experience alone I think it is
so cool this powder has 50% water and
glycerin in it which is insane not even
joking it feels like your powder is wet
like if you got some water dipped it in
your powder mix it up and apply it to
your face it kind of feels like that
it's very cooling it's something you're
gonna need to experience for yourself
for you to understand but besides all
that cool stuff this is an awesome
powder it sets my makeup and it stays
looking fresh and hydrated all day it
kind of smoothes the skin it doesn't
look powdery at all
it looks so healthy and beautiful I just
don't like it for underneath my eyes but
to set the rest of my face it is
gorgeous and then I've been loving two
foundations this one I was loving a lot
in the beginning of the month in the
beginning of March this is the LA girl
Pro matte HD long
Matt Foundation I love this it's not
tacky at all when you apply it so your
face doesn't feel sticky it feels
completely weightless on the skin yet it
gives you pretty good coverage and it's
not drying it's a matte foundation but
it's not really matte it's like a satin
matte it is beautiful
I think this would fit a lot of
different skin types the only thing is
that the color selection sucks and I
find that this does oxidize a little bit
drugstore foundations suck when it comes
to like picking colors I don't know why
but they do
but besides that it is a great great
foundation I'm in the shade medium beige
and even this one and the undertone is a
little bit off but when I got this I
started mixing these two together and
this is like my favorite foundation
cocktail right now I love this on its
own as well this is the flower beauty
like illusion luminous makeup this has
SPF 18 and this doesn't have any SPF it
kind of gives me the best of both worlds
because this foundation is very luminous
very dewy and hydrating it is tacky when
you finish applying it but it just looks
like skin like healthy juicy skin and I
love it so much I think it's worth a
shot if you have dry skin I'm in the
shade nude and I've really been loving
this drugstore combo this is actually
exclusive to Ulta this like light
illusions line but it is very very good
and I think this combo is like 25
dollars so sheep Sochi okay I have to
talk about this eyeshadow because from
the moment I purchased it I cannot get
enough of it I've been wearing it so
much in the month of March it's insane
this is the bobbi brown rich meadow
looks a shadow in the shade heat-ray I
don't know who I heard talking about
this I believe it was Elana Davison was
it Alana I could be making that up
ran out and purchased it because it
looked so beautiful and I do not regret
it sometimes I look at eyeshadows and I
think they're not really worth it to buy
just one individual eyeshadow but then I
come across something like this and I'm
like yes you are worth it to me I know
it's pricey just for one shadow but I
love using this wet and dry and I find
that there are a lot of eyeshadow
formulas out there
can't do both and this camp and in a
very beautiful way both ways I'm wearing
it on my lips today completely dry I
just rubbed my finger in this and patted
it all over my entire lid and it looks
so stunning it's like a copper I like a
copper rose gold but it has a little
golden flecks all throughout this very
micro golden flecks it's like a micro
shimmer but when you apply it to your
lid dry like you tap it in with your
finger it looks like such a gorgeous
like shimmery glow it is beautiful I'm
wearing my dream street palette on my
eyes too but all I have is Moony on my
brow bone and then I have shooting star
in my crease that's it just those two
shades and the rest is this guy and it
is beautiful I feel like this is gonna
be my go-to eyeshadow in the summer and
when you apply it wet it's like ten
times more intense but I actually prefer
it dry I want to give a quick shout out
to this bad boy right here this is the
NYX pigment primer they have a glitter
primer as well but the pigment primer is
better and I use them both in very
similar ways but I find that this one
works a little bit better this is so
comparable to high-end products out
there it is seriously one of the best
pigment primers I have ever used in my
life all you have to do is apply a
little bit of this player pigment on top
and it will not move it will not but
especially with glitters you know how
sometimes you'll apply it glitter all
over your lid and then by the end of the
day you kind of have like the glitter on
your crease area from just like blinking
this minimizes that a lot and I actually
rediscovered this because of my friend
Katrina make it by Trine's I completely
forgot to mention her in my youtubers
you should be watching video so I'm
gonna leave her channel down below she
is more popular on Instagram because she
does the best swatches known to man you
want good swatches go-to between his
Instagram she's the best but she does
also have a youtube channel so I'm going
to leave her down below check her out
but she was talking about this like in a
video or something and I pulled it back
out and I was like oh my god she is
right this is so amazing and I love this
so much oh my god had been wanting to
talk about this product all frickin
month this was a discovery all thanks to
Mariah Leonard I saw her use it in a
video and I was blown away and I
immediately purchased it and I have been
loving it ever since I don't use it all
the time just because it's a very
specific product
so never use it four times in march four
times and not saying a lot especially
for what this is okay let me just tell
you this is from a brand called lemon
head Los Angeles I have never heard of
them before but they have this thing
called space paste and this is in the
shade Houdini now this shade in Houdini
is limited edition so if you want to
pick it up I suggest you run and get it
this is basically like glitter for your
lid but it's in this intensely
reflective purple like holographic color
you can only see it when it catches the
light because when you look at this
product alone and you start to turn it
around it looks like there are little
ugly yellow glitters in this thing but
it really is all just this purple
holographic magic
don't let these little yellow dots fool
you or scare you you cannot see that
when it's on your lid it honestly just
looks like there's nothing on your lid
until that good or really catches the
light and you see that intense purple
reflect I feel like I've never used
anything like it you do have to build
this up though if you want to put this
on your entire lid you have to apply a
layer wait about a minute and a half and
then apply another layer to get a lot of
that color going I was wearing this on
my lids in my ethereal garden collection
video where I was talking about the nail
polishes that was that purple little
glitter I had on my lids in case you
were wondering I love this so much I
think you should totally check it out
especially if you want to experiment in
the spring or in the summer okay so my
next product I have been using on and
off besides toasted cinnamon you guys
know I can't get enough of matte toasted
cinnamon but I've been using this blush
as well so so much and I've just fallen
in love with this formula this is the
bare minerals Jen nude blush in that
peach though the formula on these is so
different than so many blushes I have in
my collection it almost feels like a
cream like when you really rub your
finger in there it's very very creamy
feeling like think of chalky powdery
super matte blushes this is the exact
opposite yeah it doesn't have any
shimmer or glitter or anything so it's
not really a sheen it just looks like a
healthy blush on the skin I don't really
know how to explain it but the formula
is really what makes these blushes so
amazing I have another one that I keep
here on my
I didn't include these in my blush video
because all of my most used blushes I
keep here on my vanity and I forgot
I completely forgot to mention that in
that blush video but I have pretty in
pink and this would also be really nice
for spring but I've been using that
peach though a lot more because you know
I love peach
alright let's talk about some highlights
I have been loving so much in March when
is drugstore and one is much more
high-end but the drugstore highlights
that has just stolen my heart this month
is this Milani stellar lights
highlighter palette and this in the
shade rose glow this is so good and I
always knew it was good but I feel like
I've been using it so much more recently
as you can probably tell because it's
the one that's the most use this is my
favorite shade in the palette but I do
tend to mix it a lot with this one this
one is just so light for my skin tone
but it's so blinding I'm wearing golden
quartz like all over the place all over
my cheek and then I just popped pearl
like right at the tippy tops of my
cheekbones and on the tippy top of my
nose and I think it looks so glowy and
pretty these are super intense but
they're not gonna look too chunky or
glittery I just think it's so good I
highly recommend this
you can mix all the colors together it's
just a really great highlighter formula
this has changed my mind about cream
highlighters because I've always liked
them but I've never loved them I've
never been super obsessed but this this
is a winner for me this is the hourglass
vanish highlighter stick and this is in
the shade champagne flash this one's my
favorite it gives you the most beautiful
champagne glow to your skin but it
actually looks like it's your skin like
these you can tell they're highlights I
mean they look wet on the skin and they
look beautiful but this looks like it's
part of your skin I will apply this all
over my skin like on the cheekbones here
on top of my brow here on my nose and
this just looks so glowy even though it
is pricey I think it's worth it because
the formula is that good and it just
looks incredible on the skin okay so I
have to scan out lip products to share
with you guys one of them is actually
from the brand Frank body do you guys
know this brand they sell it at Ulta but
they were really famous for their coffee
scrub but this is their lip tint and
this is in the shade send nudes and I
love this this has been my go-to like
everyday
lip color I keep it in my purse and it's
a nude but it's more of like a pinky
rosy noon but I just like how smooth and
natural it looks on the lips it's not
too glossy or like wet so it doesn't
slip around everywhere it has a really
nice consistency to it and I like that
it gives me a little bit of a tint but
the best thing about this is that it
smells like coffee this is my dream come
true guys do you have any Indian have
you ever seen my bio coffee is my life I
love coffee it messes up my stomach but
I love the taste I love the smell I just
like the experience of drinking coffee
putting this on my lips it gives me joy
and I pretty much love everything else
about it so it's gonna go to of mine and
this is gonna go back into my purse as
soon as this video is over and then the
other lip product I wanted to talk about
is this from those two for a brand they
came out with a ton of lipsticks and
they're called the lip stories lipsticks
I believe and this is actually the only
one I've tried they sent all of them to
me and I gave most of them away just
because I love sharing the love and I
feel like I get so much why not give
some stuff to my friends but anyway I
kept a few that I really liked I think I
kept like 10 of them that just looked
like my type of colors but this is the
only one I've tried because when I tried
this one I didn't put it down and I've
been wearing this a lot on its own but
I've mainly been wearing it kind of like
mixed with different things like I'm
wearing it today but I have my color pop
moonchild gloss on top this color I
don't know if all of them are like this
but this is in the shade we like the
French word weak this one is so creamy
it has a really pretty shine finish it's
not glossy but it's definitely a shiny
lipstick and it's kind of slippy and it
doesn't last on its own at all but when
I apply this on top of a long red lip
liner it does stay on all day and it
just looks so healthy like it makes your
lips look nice and healthy it is a super
smooth lipstick this is like a dewy
lipstick and I think the packaging is
really cute too it has all of these like
gowns very very cute
Marc Jacobs Daisy Twinkle perfume I have
been wearing this non-stop ever since I
got it I'll just spray a couple sprays
on my wrist and on my neck and it's such
a soft beautiful spring scent and I
actually find that it does last a good
amount of time on me it doesn't last all
day but for a set like this I am pretty
impressed some of the notes are
sparkling raspberry violet flower and
creme de cassis all I smell in this is
the violet this smells like Violetta to
me I know I said this already
but like that baby Cologne our parents
used to put on us when we were younger
at least all my Hispanic friends their
parents used to use it when we were
younger that delicious baby Violeta
scent but in a grown-up version this is
my go-to spring scent I feel like I'm
gonna be wearing this throughout the
entire season it's so fresh and the
bottle is a 1 like this is the most
beautiful bottle ever unfortunately they
don't have a freaking rollerball I went
online to buy one the other day so that
I could wear it on Easter well by the
time you're watching this video
Easter already passed but I'm going to
be wearing this on Easter and I wanted a
rollerball to keep in my purse cuz I'm
gonna be outside all day but it's fine
moving on I do want to give a quick
shout out to my necklaces my sister has
launched these zodiac necklaces and
wanting her to launch something like
this for so long because she has this
little moon and this little Sun in her
jewelry line as well and I thought it
would be so cool to layer the necklaces
I like to wear the little Sun and the
little moon and then wear your Sun Sign
and your moon sign which if you didn't
know my son sign is Aquarius like that
is my actual sign but my moon sign is
Scorpio so I have an Aquarius and a
Scorpio necklace and I wear them layered
with my Sun and Moon and I think it's so
cute I love anything zodiac it's like an
addiction like a real addiction I keep
reading books on astrology like I am so
in I'm so in right now but anyway I have
been loving these and I just want to
give a cute little shout out to her and
