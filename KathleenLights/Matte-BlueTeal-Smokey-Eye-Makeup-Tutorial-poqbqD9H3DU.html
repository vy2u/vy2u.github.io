makeup tutorial on the look I'm wearing
right now I am using the dream street
palette today obviously I trickled into
all of the Blues in this palette I mean
I always consider this a blue even
though this is not a blue but I did a
matte teal smokey eye with a shimmery
lower lash line and this is one of my
go-to looks with this palette I love
using water bear on my entire lid it's
so dramatic but it's so cool and like
fun and smokey most of the time I'll
take potion in my crease but today I
didn't do that I just used the Browns
and I made it a little bit more neutral
because I usually always put water bear
on the lid and then potion in the crease
but I didn't do that today I decided to
just stick to the blues and I love this
look it is very messy and like intense
and smoky but I love looks like this I
think it's really fun and perfect if
you're wanting a dramatic look out of
this palette so this is officially the
first tutorial in my dream Street series
I guess I want to do a ton of tutorials
using this palette and I'm so sorry the
lips sold out so fast moonchild is
actually still available that's why I
used it in today's video and the palette
is also still available but dreamy and
rev are sold out but I'm trying my best
to get them back in stock as soon as
possible like we are really working on
getting them back in stock so don't
worry they will be restocking soon but
anyway if you want to see how to get
this really intense met teal smokey eye
then just keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyes with
the Tarte shape tape concealer and now
I'm gonna take this Rimmel Kate eye
shadow stick in the shade of pure
turquoise and I'm just gonna use this as
a base for the eye shadow to stick to
and I want the blue to really really pop
so I want a lighter blue base underneath
but you can skip this step if you would
like but anyway moving on
so once I've blended that onto my lid
I'm gonna go into the shade water-bearer
which is the star of the show and I'm
just gonna start packing this color on
my entire lid and dragging it up to the
crease of it but I'm not really like
taking it too far up into the crease but
well you know you know what I'm doing by
the way I'm losing my voice I don't know
why cuz I'm not sick
or maybe I'm getting sick who knows
story of my life anyway going into the
shade shooting star I'm gonna use this
to blend out my crease normally I would
put on my crease shade first
but I'm gonna be using a few shades to
really blend out this blue color so I'm
just taking shooting star on a fluffy
brush and really blending out the edges
of that water-bearer now to add a little
bit of peach eNOS and warmth I'm gonna
go into magical and I'm just gonna dust
this into my crease and blending some
more this look is it takes a lot a lot a
lot of blending so be patient don't
worry you can do it you just gotta blend
a lot like quickly I'm gonna go into the
shade Moony and I'm gonna use this to
highlight underneath my brow bone now
I'm gonna go into the shade elfish and
I'm gonna be using this to further blend
out the crease like I said it's a lot of
blending and I'm just using these
different shades to blend out the crease
make sure there are no harsh lines
I'm gonna go back into water-bearer
because obviously we did a lot of
blending most of the shadow got blended
away so I'm just doing a little touch-up
here and again more blending as I'm
taking elfish again that dark brown
color I'm just blending out that blue
I'm gonna go back into shooting star and
I'm gonna do the exact same thing more
blending I mean you can see it's a very
easy I look it just takes a lot of work
because you know you're blending for a
long time but it's very simple and easy
to do packing on some more of that water
Bereshit and then I'm just gonna clean
up the fallout underneath my eyes and
then I'm gonna move on to the rest of my
face
before I finish up the eyes so to prime
the skin I'm taking the Catrice Prime
and fine nude glow primer and I'm just
I'm applying a lot of this all over my
face I love how hydrating and glowy this
makes my skin look and then for
foundation I wanted to dip into this
foundation again this is the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD I've been using the ultra
HD stick so much I wanted to try this
one out again and I gotta say I like the
stick so much better than the liquid
version so I think I'm actually gonna be
passing this foundation along
surprisingly I just love this stick so
much anyway I'm going in with concealer
and I'm taking the Tarte shape tape of
course underneath my eyes and I'm
blending that out with this venti beauty
brush
to set my concealer I'm going in with
the Milani prep and set glow
illuminating transparent powder and I am
setting my under eyes with this and I'm
also setting the rest of my face where I
added concealer for some reason I didn't
show that part but I added some
concealer on my chin and on my nose and
around my mouth you know like I usually
do just to highlight the rest of the
face and to finish up this smokey eye
I'm going to take shooting star and I'm
really gonna buff this color underneath
my lower lash line this is gonna help us
blend all the other colors on the top
then I'm gonna go in oh crap I forgot I
did line my eyes I don't know why I
didn't show you the eyeliner but I'm
using an Arden see in black liner just
to tightline and to add to my waterline
I went into water-bearer and I'm taking
this color very very closely to my lower
lash line and really packing this color
on and then I'm gonna take mermaid boy
and I'm applying this right on top I'm
also gonna drag mermaid boy out you'll
see here I kind of like extend it to my
table as you can see they're like I'm
dragging it out I don't know I thought
it looked pretty cool
and messy and grungy so I did that and
then I took the shade kaleidoscope and I
used this to highlight my inner corners
I'm sorry this part is very blurry I
didn't notice so I took kaleidoscope to
highlight and then I went in with sweet
dreams to highlight right on top so it
wasn't too silvery blue it added a
little bit of like golden touch to the
inner corners applied some mascara to my
top and bottom lashes and I went in with
the violet Voss whisper real good
falsies and then that completes the eyes
to contour my face
I took the Kevin a Quan sculpting powder
in the shade light just to add a little
bit of depth to my cheeks I want it to
contour because the bronzer I'm about to
use is pretty warm and that is the Lisa
Frank and glamour dolls bronzer that I
got in my Ipsy bag I'm obsessed with
this and I'm just bronzing up the skin
with this this is the bitten and bronzed
matte bronzer and I love it it adds so
much warmth to my face and I added that
to my face and my neck a bit just to
even everything out and then for blush I
went in with the wet and wild color icon
blush in the shade apricot in the middle
and I'm taking a large powder brush to
apply this but that's okay I don't even
know why I grabbed that brush but I did
and then to highlight the skin I'm
taking the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in Champagne Pope
and then to finish off the look I'm
taking the Mac lip pencil in the shade
etc and I'm using this to outline my
lips but I'm also gonna fill my lips in
a little bit with this color as well and
then of course the gloss I'm applying on
top is the colour-pop ultra glossy lip
and moonchild and that just gives you a
nice juicy look to the lips but yeah
