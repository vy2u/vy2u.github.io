tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it's basically the same look I was
wearing in my Too Faced
peaches-and-cream Scalextric you a
couple of things on my face are
different but the eye look is pretty
much exactly the same and I had so many
comments in that video requesting a
tutorial on this look so here it is for
you guys the only palette I use on my
eyes is the Too Faced Just Peachy mattes
palette I use pretty much every single
shade in this palette except three of
them so yes
love this look I hope you guys do too
and if you want to see how to create
this look then just keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyes and
now I'm gonna take the Just Peachy
mattes palette and I'm gonna dip in to
peach butter and I'm just gonna use this
to set down the eyeshadow primer so it's
not tacky or sticky and then I'm gonna
go in with the shade peach tea and this
is gonna be my transition color and I'm
pretty much gonna put this everywhere
but I'm really focusing this on the
outer corners I'm kind of like dragging
it up I don't know if you can tell there
but so it looks kind of like a cat eye
effect I'm still applying it in my
crease and in my outer corners as you
can see but I am dragging it outwards
towards the end of my brow
now I'm going in with the shade peach
cobbler and I'm just gonna use this kind
of in the same way I use that other
shade but I'm focusing this one more on
the lid and in the crease I'm not
dragging it up too much
I want to make sure everything stays
nice and blended and diffused so I went
in with a brush that didn't have any
eyeshadow on it and I just buffed out
the edges but then I took just peachy
and I use this shade to help blend
everything so I'm not doing a cut crease
or anything but I'm gonna take my
concealer and I'm going to carve out the
inner corners not really carve it out
but I'm just applying this on the inner
half not inner corners but like the
inner half of my eye because the peach
eyeshadow I'm gonna put down I want it
to look as vibrant as possible and since
we were blending so many eye shadows I
want to make sure it like sticks to a
nice clean canvas
so I'm going to take the shade peaches
and cream and I'm just gonna apply that
everywhere I applied the concealer
I'm going back into peach cobbler and
I'm doing the same thing I did earlier
with the shade focusing this on the
outer corners and dragging it into the
crease as well just so that that peach
color fades nicely into that eye shadow
I'm taking the shade peach tart and I'm
gonna focus this color on my lid but
mainly on the outer corners and I'm also
gonna drag and blend this color out
towards the end of my brows to give my
eyes like that cat eye look I was
talking about earlier so I'm mainly
packing this on the outer corners and
just dragging it up I here I'm just
intensifying the peach shade and then
I'm gonna go into fresh-picked and I'm
just blending everything together making
sure there are no harsh edges and that
everything like blends into one another
this look requires a lot of blending for
my brow bone I'm taking a peach meringue
and I'm using this to highlight and then
I'm gonna go back into peach tart and
I'm just gonna intensify the outer
corners I wanted it just a little bit
darker so that's what I'm doing here and
then I just took a makeup wipe to clean
up the fallout and to create that sharp
cat eye look at the edge of my eyes
alright so for my face I'm gonna apply
some primer and moisturizer I'm gonna do
a little bit of a cocktail this is
something I just recently picked up I've
actually never used this before this is
the Wren clean skincare perfect canvas
silicone free skin finishing serum
you're supposed to use this after
moisturizer it says to use one to two
drops and Pat this on the skin until
it's fully absorbed and supposedly it's
great for underneath makeup but it does
say for those of you in a rush
simply add to your moisturizer I'm not
in a rush but I'm gonna add it to my
moisturizer this is the Kiehl's ultra
facial moisturizer by the way I think
I'm losing my voice my friend came over
last night and she was sick and as soon
as she walked in through the door I was
like oh no you're gonna get me sick and
look at me I woke up with a sore throat
I just knew it everybody who's sick
around me passes it to me I have the
world's worst immune system I only sick
always so I'm gonna take a cut like two
drops of this it says
and then I'm just gonna mix it in with
the moisturizer when you first drop this
on to your skin like on your hand and
you blend it in it gets really really
sticky but I really wanted to mix it in
with my moisturizer because my skin is
feeling really dry today all right and
for foundation I'm gonna go in with my
two-faced peach perfect comfort matte
foundation I'm in the shade light beige
and I'm gonna apply this using a Beauty
Blender I'm sure you guys already know
how I feel about this foundation if you
saw my review but I really like it I
know a lot of people say it breaks them
out I was reading your comments but I
haven't noticed any breakouts at least
not yet and I've been wearing it a lot
so hopefully it doesn't break me out
because now it's in like the back of my
mind now I'm gonna apply some concealer
just to conceal some of these dark
circles and to highlight my face I'm
gonna use the color pop and no filter
concealer in the shade light neutral
it's a little bit light for me right now
but when you blend it in and all of that
it ends up working out
all right so I know it looks a little
bit bright underneath the eyes but we're
gonna fix that with this guy this is the
router from glossier it's their loose
face powder and this is in the shade
light/medium I have to pick up the shade
light if they have it because this is
just a hair too dark for underneath the
eyes but on the rest of my face it's
fine
so I just applied that to my entire face
as you saw I love this powder it's so
good definitely one of my top five
favorite powders I've ever tried and now
I'm just gonna go ahead and finish the
rest of my eye makeup I'm gonna take
this shade peach tea it's the color we
originally used in the crease and I'm
just packing this color on my lower lash
line I want it to be really really smoky
under there so I'm just pretty much
putting that everywhere I'm gonna go
into peach tart on a smaller little
pencil brush and I'm focusing this color
on the outer half of my eye and I'm
dragging it up so that it connects with
the eyeshadow on my top lid I don't know
if you can tell what I was doing there
but I went into chocolate-dipped it's
the darkest shadow in the palette and I
applied some on the outer corners of my
eyes but I'm mainly using this shadow on
the lower lash line and I'm dragging it
up to kind of create like a winged liner
and I'm also putting some of this really
close to my top lashes as well I mean
you see what I'm doing I'm kind of
creating like eyeliner with eyeshadow
and this step really makes the eyes pop
because it looks like you know you have
like the eyeliner extended out gives you
a nice cat eye effect and I really love
how it looks now I'm just applying
mascara to my top and bottom lashes
alright so the eyes are completely done
now I can go ahead and finish up the
face I'm going to contour my face using
the palm island bronzer from ciate
this is what the bronzer looks like by
the way I really like this bronzer it
applies really smoothly I like it okay
so I want to bronze up the skin a little
bit more with something that has a
little bit of a sheen to it so I'm gonna
take a big fluffy brush and I'm gonna
dip into the private party bronzer from
colour-pop and you can't tell but this
has a very slight sheen to it so I'm
just gonna play this to the skin
for blush I'm gonna go in with something
peachy of course this is the Burt's bee
Burt's Bees blush in bare peach I love
this blush it's very subtle and very
natural but I like how it makes the skin
look it's barely noticeable but when
it's on the skin you could really see I
don't know if you can tell it just gives
the cheeks are very subtle subtle subtle
luminosity okay we are almost done
almost done I'm just gonna apply some
highlight to my face I'm gonna take the
color pop give me more highlight palette
and I'm gonna dip into the only
highlight I use basically I like a
couple of the other ones but this one
right here this is the winner they need
to release it in a single
um alright so now I want my skin to look
as natural and as skin like as possible
so I'm gonna play some setting spray so
that the highlight can just melt into
the skin and all the powder products can
and all the powder products can do that
as well feel like I said Potter and I
take my morphe prep and set makeup
setting spray let that dry
I'm gonna finish off the look with my
lip color I'm just gonna put on the same
lip I was wearing in my peaches and
cream review but I am gonna top it off
with like a lip gloss kind of thing so
I'm gonna take the two-faced peach kiss
lipstick in the shade of Sunday Funday I
forgot to mention this in my review but
these lipsticks have the most potent
sent out of everything in the collection
the lipsticks smell the strongest and it
stays lingering for a while like I smell
this lipstick on my mouth for a for a
while alright so I really love how matte
lips look with this look because it's
all matte and I think that looks really
nice but just to change things up I'm
gonna go over it with this guy this is
the benefit punch pop punch pop dice a
punch pop on the back it says the liquid
lip color but I think it's just like a
liquefied version of a lipstick and it
actually has like a glossy finish so
it's gonna apply that on top okay so
that completes this look absolutely love
how it turned out I've done this look a
few times with this palette already and
I love it every time it's perfect for so
many occasions but yes that completes
this video guys thank you so much for

colors but I used all the other this is
