tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I almost didn't finish this look I
got to a part in my eye makeup that was
quite a challenge quite a challenge I'm
sure he could already tell in the intro
but I attended some sort of like a cut
crease cat eye situation here and I
really messed this eye up I mean I
messed both eyes up I didn't know what I
was doing I really was just trying
something out and I feel like I failed
but I told myself you know what Kathleen
keep going do the eyeliner put on some
falsies do the whole thing
finish your face and then decide if you
want to put this on YouTube or not but I
will I think it will even though the cut
crease part of this look didn't go as
planned I think the rest of the makeup
came out pretty cool I'm using Lee
Natasha's anona Lila palette in this
video here's the thing before I scream
at me I know this palette is very very
pricey pretty ridiculous I know but I do
get a ton of requests asking me to use
this palette there's a ton of you out
there that have this palette at home so
this video is for you guys I'm actually
recreating a Natasha de Nonna
eye makeup tutorial like I take zero
credit for this look I'm gonna link the
video down below but Natasha de Nonna
did this exact look on someone else and
I actually had my phone right in front
of me you guys couldn't see it but I had
my phone right in front me and I was
recreating the entire look I was doing
everything she did
step by step I'm gonna link her video
down below I know I've said this in the
past but she's my favorite makeup artist
of all time she barely touches an
eyeball and it like turns into a
masterpiece my dream and the makeup
world is to get my makeup done by her
she's obsessed with her she inspires me
every single day every time she post a
makeup look I'm like blown away and I
actually wanted to do this look for my
anniversary I'm going out to dinner for
my anniversary by the time you're
watching this video my anniversary
already past but I really wanted to do
this look but I didn't know if I could
so today was my test run and I am
do it but I think I'm not gonna do the
cut crease part because I'm atrocious at
it and it was an epic fail but I think
the rest of the eye makeup looks really
pretty this is a perfect look for prom
if you don't have the Lila palette like
I said it's pricey use eyeshadows you
have at home that are similar to this
I'm sure you can get these kinds of
shades at color pop and they're single
shadows or with makeup geek Anastacio
just use eyeshadows you have at home if
you want to recreate this look and it
may be kind of stupid recreating a look
that's already on YouTube but I'm always
following along tutorials sometimes I
sit down to do my makeup and I'm like
not inspired so I will YouTube a
tutorial and I will follow along I've
been doing this since I discovered
YouTube it's fun to recreate tutorials
and I hope you recreate this one if you
haven't already because it's already
been done and to balance things out in
this video since I'm using a super
pricey eyeshadow the rest of the
products on my face are drugstore or
affordable so while the eyes screamed at
suspense the face is saying huh that's
reasonable but anyway this is a full
glam look lashes liner the whole shebang
and if you want to see how to get this
look then just keep watching okay so my
eyes are already primed and ready to go
the first shade I'm gonna use is called
nude vino and I'm taking this into my
crease and I'm kind of using a smaller
brush than I normally would because I
want it to be very precise usually the
first color I start off with I like blow
it out in the crease and it's very
blended but I'm being very very precise
with the shade in my crease then I'm
gonna take this shape called Juno Juno I
think that's how she says it dunno and
I'm just gonna use this as my brow bone
highlight and as my inner corner
highlight next we are going into the
shade nude mauve and I'm just using this
to blend out the edges of the nude we
know just so that everything looks a
little bit more blended you know at
least that's when the Tosh's did
okay now I'm going into the shade helio
hip hate hey Leo she says it in the
video and I don't remember but I'm going
in with this shade and I'm popping this
all over the lid it is such a gorgeous
shade then I'm gonna go back into new to
vino and I'm gonna kind of create like a
cat eye look I'm focusing this color
right at the edges you don't have to be
too precise with this because I mean a
lot of the eyeliner is gonna cover this
part so I'm not trying to be too perfect
with it but then I went into nude mom
and I just blended out the edges so
there are no harsh lines you know
Natasha's a lot better at explaining
this tutorial by the way a lot better
I'm just gonna clean up the fallout I
have on my face and then I'm gonna move
on to the face before I finish up the
eyes I'm gonna take this elf locket
primer I gotta say the more I use it the
more I don't like it but I'm still I'm
still giving it a shot I'm like I have
my days with it
for foundation I'm mixing two
foundations I'm taking the Maybelline
matte and poreless foundation and then
I'm mixing it with my number seven lift
and luminate limit lift and luminous
foundation and I like the combo of these
two it gives me like a very natural
finish I really really like it or
concealer I'm gonna use the color pop no
filter concealer in the shade like
neutral and I'm just popping this
underneath my eyes to cover up my dark
circles and I'm also gonna use this
concealer on the rest of like kind of
like on the center of my face to
highlight the face as well
to set down my concealer I'm gonna take
the Wet n Wild photo focus powder and
I'm just gonna set my under eyes and you
know everywhere I put the concealer okay
so now I'm gonna work on my lower lash
line I'm gonna take the shade nude vino
and I'm just gonna buff this really
really close to my outer corners just to
mimic my top lid I only want this shade
on the very outer corners and then I'm
gonna go into this beautiful shade right
here this one is called livid and I'm
gonna buff this directly across my lower
lash line just so it gives you like a
nice pop of purple I really love that
she added this to the look I think it's
really really pretty
and then to just blend everything out
I'm just gonna take a little bit of nude
mom and buff out that situation by the
way I redid my inner corner highlight
made it more vibrant and then I messed
up the whole look by trying to do the
little negative space thing she did but
I'm not a professional I did it so I was
really bad really bad at it but I
decided to keep trucking to go with it
and hope for the best so that's what I
did
but I mean you could totally skip this
step and the eye shadow look would still
be really really pretty for eyeliner I'm
gonna use my anglich gel liner in number
77 and I'm using my favorite little uh
Nastasia number 15 brush and I'm doing a
big wing with this she has like a very
long wing kind of like a cat eye look
it's very very pretty I completely cut
myself off doing it but you know I added
a very long wing and then I didn't show
it I don't know why I didn't lift up the
palette but I'm taking the shade Layla
and I'm buffing this color on my
eyeliner just to give it like a smudgy
look kind of like a smoky messy smudgy
look I love that and then I just popped
on some mascara and went in with the
studio effect with studio effects
whispies by Ardell and then that
completes the eye look not too bad once
everything is you know once everything
is done not too bad but to bronze up the
skin I'm going in with my Physicians
Formula but a bronzer
and then for blush I'm taking the
essence satin touch blush in the shade
satin love really beautiful blush I love
it for highlight I'm going in with two
highlights this one's more of like a
face highlight this is the essence pure
nude highlighter I'm pretty much putting
this everywhere just to give my face a
little bit more of a glow but to give
that pop to the cheeks I'm going in with
the super shock cheek in flexitarian by
color pop and this is really gonna make
the cheeks look wet and metallic I feel
like it's you know it's necessary for
this look and then to complete the look
I'm just gonna go in with my lip combo
first I'm taking this Maybelline X Gigi
Hadid lip liner in Tara and I'm just
over drawing my lips with this kind of
making my lips look a little bit juicier
a little bit more plump and then I'm
lining them in like filling them in and
then the lip the lipstick and can I
speak today the lipstick I'm putting on
top is the Maybelline purely nude matte
lipstick I just wanted to lighten up the
lip liner because I wanted a super nude
lip and then I went in with the bonnibel
lip light lip gloss in the shade
cappuccino and I love this glass it's so
cheap to it and yeah guys that completes
this look I really hope you guys enjoyed
