tutorial and of like a Mavi
monochromatic look waist a purple winged
liner I really like how this look turned
out I kind of winged it today was the
first time I even used this eyeshadow
palette so totally winging it but I
loved it and I hope you guys really like
it too and if you want to see how to get
this makeup look then just keep watching
I'm going to prime my eyes with the
Urban Decay primer potion in enigma
excuse my dark circles it looks like a
morning eyeshadow and I'm not so I just
set that timer with some face powder and
now we're going to move on to some eye
shadow I'm going to be using the new
dose of colors marvelous mom's palette I
haven't worn this one yet I've been
using the baked Browns one it's in this
exact same packaging only it has brown
shades obviously that one is a little
bit more me but I thought it would be
nice to try this out for a video I
rarely ever do mommy colors so this is
new I'm going to take the first shade in
the palette called fluffy and I'm just
going to apply this really softly on my
entire lid the brown palette blend it
out really nicely the formula was really
good so I'm just fitting this everywhere
now I'm going to take a fluffy blending
brush and I'm going to dip it into the
second shade in the palette this was
called rosy and I'm just going to start
building this color into increase one
thing you have to note with these
eyeshadows is that they are very powdery
they're kind of similar to the lorac Pro
palette or the Anastacio palette when
you put your brush in a lot of powder
comes up there's a lot of kick up
we are literally just going to go down
the aisle I'm going to take the next
color and the pilot this one is called
wishy-washy and with a smaller crease
brush I'm just going to do the exact
same thing only the application is just
going to be a little bit more precise I
don't want this to be blown out in the
entire crease I just want to mainly
focus this a little bit underneath the
other color I'm not going to drag it up
too high I'm kind of flicking it out
just a little bit just what I could look
a little bit more angled here
I'm going to go back into that first
shade we used fluffy and I'm just going
to add a little bit more on the inner
corners here now I'm going to take this
really pretty like reddish purpley Brown
and it's called spaced out and I'm just
going to do the exact same process I've
been doing I'm going to focus it on the
outer corners but I'm not going to apply
as much as I applied the last shade
every color I put down I get more and
more precise so now I'm just going to
dip into this one and I'm just going to
focus this right in the outer corner I'm
going to drag this color a little bit
into the crease but not that much
okay and then we're going to take the
left color in the palette it's called
wine stain and on a different brush of
smaller crease brush I'm going to the up
and I'm going to take this shade very
carefully on the outer corners I don't
want it to look too intense
okay so now I'm going to take that color
we first melt this one my color we first
used in the crease or that same crease
brush we used with it and I'm just going
to lightly blend out all the edges and
now I'm just taking fluffy one more time
and making it a little bit more intense
on the inner corners because we there's
so much blending a lot of it just
blending it away okay so I'm going to go
ahead and apply some liquid eyeliner
normally right now I would just go ahead
and clean it up but I'm going to wait
until after my liquid liner is on to do
that so I'm going to take the Inglis gel
liner in the shade 83 I wanted to use
this because it's purple so it's similar
to the eye shadow but it's like a
completely different purple they look
nothing alike but I think it's going to
look cool I don't know I've never tried
this before I've never even tried this
eyeliner I'm going to take my favorite
eyeliner brush this is the anna sophia
number 15 and i have to get really close
to this mirror and here we go
okay so I totally messed up on the side
but that's okay we're going to clean it
up so now I'm just going to take a
little cotton square with a little bit
of Bioderma on it well a lot of bit of
wild room on it
and I'm just going to clean everything
up okay so I just extended my wing a
little bit more after I cleaned it up I
just made it sharper in the outer
corners and then I applied something to
my browbone and during that whole time
my camera shut off and I didn't notice
but I took the city color intense
exposure highlighter and I use that to
highlight my brow bone but I want to
take another color because I want
something a little bit more matte and
more intense so no fancy my morphe
palette I'm probably to be showing this
I know it's out of stock and it's gone
forever but I'm just going to take this
matte cream color and use this
underneath my brow bone dirty I'm just
going to use that to clean up everything
underneath the brow bone use any matte
cream color you have I'm sure you have
one in your collection for my inner
corners I'm going to take this vivid
baked highlighter by makeup revolution
in the shade radiant light and I'm just
going to apply a little bit to the inner
corners when I apply concealer I'm going
to assume most of it is going to get
blended away so I'll just retouch this
later on yeah I have a memory of a
goldfish so I totally forgot to do that
so now we can move on to the face before
I finish up my eyes okay so for my face
I am going to use some of the products I
spoke about in my monthly favourites
video so of course I'm going to prime my
skin with this bad boy this is the elf
prep and hydrate balm I have been using
this and I have been loving this for my
dry skin it just feels so nice when you
apply it's kind of like cooling not as
cooling as the milk one milk has a balm
stick really similar to this it's more
expensive so this is definitely a good
dupe but the other one is a little bit
more cooling so I'm just gonna like
press that into my skin this doesn't
throw your pores or anything like that
it really is just like a hydrating balm
I do not like how sticky this leaves my
hands though okay so the foundation I'm
going to be wearing today is the one I
was wearing in my favorites video it's
not a favorite of the month or anything
this is literally the second time I use
it I tried it out for the first time
when I was doing my makeup for my
favorites video and it is the era
everyday era brush foundation I
purchased this because I saw thought to
use video on it I'm
some of you can really it looked
flawless on her skin and I went online
and I purchased it immediately it's an
aerosol foundation really similar to the
Dior one and I love the Dior one but
that one I think breaks me out and I'm
so scared to retry it but yeah anyway
what is up with the cap on this
foundation like really I don't see the
need for that really weird so you
definitely want to make sure that when
it comes to foundations like this like
these aerosol cans you want to shake it
up really good I picked mine up in the
shade summer wheat why five four medium
yellow undertone skin
I'm not medium skin I don't know why I
think that the shade it's not terrible
it is going to match me in the
summertime perfectly or if I self ten it
will match me but right now it is a
little bit dark for me I'm going to use
my eco tools sponge I spoke about this
in my favorites video I love this bunch
so I'm just going to spray it onto the
actual sponge because we all saw what
happened to Kathy that's not going to
happen to me that was actually pretty
funny one thing I will say about this
foundation it stinks so bad I don't
remember if she said in the video if it
smelled maybe she did but I just don't
remember but oh my gosh the scent on
this product it's honestly almost
unbearable like I'm borderline almost
didn't wear it when I first smelled it
but the finish is just so pretty
think this foundation oxidizes a little
bit but it does have a flawless finish
like your skin literally looks
airbrushed I like the coverage I like
how it feels while I'm wearing it on the
skin it lasts all day on me I just
cannot get over this scent like it
lingers like I could smell it sitting on
my face I had to have gotten about one I
just I can't I can't it smells like
rotten donut it's not weird so this is
the foundation on my skin like I said it
is just a hair too dark for me it looks
like a little too yellow but the finish
is so pretty I just I love it now I'm
going to go in with some concealer I'm
going to use the wet and wild photo
focus concealer I have been loving this
it just blends so easily
I love
I'm just going to apply kind of like a
lot of this because I want everything to
match and I want to even out my skin
tone and the foundation is you know a
little dark
I'm going to set down that concealer
using my Siana styles invisible finish
loose setting powder in white stone
okay so I've completely set my entire
face and now I'm just going to finish up
the eyes I know I do my makeup in like
the weirdest steps but this is just what
works for me so let's move on to the end
I'm going to take this eyeliner by NYX
it's one of their faux black liners and
this one is in the shade blackberry it's
a really dark purple it's so pretty so
I'm going to tightline with it and I'm
also going to apply this to my waterline
then I'm going to take a pencil brush
and I'm going to dip it into this shade
wishy-washy and I'm just going to blend
this underneath my lower lash line I
don't want to make it too intense I
don't want my lower lash line to be like
ridiculously smoky like I usually like
it I'm just going to apply just a little
bit of this and then I'm going to take
the dark shade in the palette wine stain
and I'm going to apply this right here
in the very outer corner of my eye just
let it can mimic the top lid we have the
darker color right at the outer corners
on the top so we're going to put it
right in the outer corners of the bottom
as well
I'm going to try a different mascara for
my bottom lashes let's see how it goes
for my top lash I'm going to use the
benefit roller lash mascara for the
mascara on my lower lash line I'm going
to try something different am I end up
hating it but you know whatever that's
what make it score this is the Mac
mascara the in extreme dimension but
this is in the shade jim-dandy
this is a strange name it's like a
really dark indigo purple kind of
similar to the eyeliner I'm wearing
actually so I thought it would be cool
to try this out on the lower lash line I
don't even know if it's going to show
off purple well yeah it does it is I
kind of like that I think it looks cool
okay so this is the finished eye look I
actually really like how that lower lash
mascara turned out because it is a very
very dark purple and you could only tell
it's purple if you look up close because
it's not a huge difference from the
mascara on my top lashes but it does
give you a little bit of something but
anyway I'm going to go ahead and finish
the rest of my face okay so I had to do
the rest of this in a voiceover because
the dogs could not stop barking so I
just took my Marc Jacobs new fantastic
bronzer and I just brought up the skin
with this it's showing up really warm on
camera for some reason but it's not just
gives you a really pretty nice tan I
love it and I'm putting this everywhere
for blush I took the Tarte Amazonian
clay blush in the shade exposed it's
like an oldie but a goodie it just looks
so nice with ma vie toned eyeshadows I
love this blush whenever I do cooler
tone looks I'm just popping that onto my
cheeks
and then for highlight I'm taking that
same highlight I use in my inner corners
the one I totally forgot to put back
into my inner corners yeah that
highlight I'm using it to highlight the
tops of my cheekbones and I'm also going
to highlight my nose as well I love how
it gives me like a really pretty soft
pink pearl look I love it so I'm going
to set down all of this makeup with the
Milani make it last setting spray and
while that's drying I'm going to go in
with my lip color this is the Cielo
liquid lipstick in the shade and I love
it it's the prettiest Mulvey purple ever
and yeah guys that completes this makeup
look I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye not as
cooling as the melt no no hello ah new

corner with your hand like I would love
