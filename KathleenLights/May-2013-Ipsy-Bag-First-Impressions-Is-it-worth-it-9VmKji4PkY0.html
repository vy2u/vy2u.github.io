to say excuse my appearance
I literally have mascara bronzer and
stick on only and stuff like a t-shirt
on I'm leaving to the doctor in like
less than 20 minutes and I wanted to put
this video up while I wanted to record
it before I left because I got my Ipsy
bag in the mail today and I wanted to do
like my first impression like unbox me
thing and I actually wanted to open it
for the first time on camera and my hair
is just not anyway um this one is
actually really cool because nobody got
the same thing why me I'm sure well here
we got the same thing but like last
month you either got um the light blush
or the dark blush or you got like the
blue hair thing or the red hair thing
like you know you knew you'd about this
or that this month everybody got
different different things so even if
you kind of cheated by seeing what other
people got this month you don't know
what you got again I apologize if I seem
scatterbrained and just in a hurry kind
of okay so it comes with these two cards
things you get a 110 dollars off of
anything from nume and then like this
that I'm sure nobody reads this is the
bag comes in this month I actually like
it a lot more than last month as a
mirrors it's smaller than last month's
bag I don't know but I like it more than
last month I wasn't feeling the all
white because like Chevron it's cute
oh and okay so the first thing that's in
here is this little concealer umm if she
has been giving a lot of yagi stuff away
this is like the yeah be brand I don't
know if this is my color I was a little
skeptical about this concealer because
everybody got the concealer and I was
like oh my
they give me one that's like let me see
hmm you know what let's test drive this
bad boy
okay not my favorite not my favorite but
um
it's not a great under eye concealer
kind of settled into my lines pretty
quickly but this would be a good like
eyeshadow base I love using concealer as
eyeshadow bases so that's what I'm going
to use this for so I got that and then
it comes with a soil net ZOA nail polish
everybody got a soil and nail polish why
can't I talk okay yeah this got a break
it
oh how cute this is the color I got it's
like a cream colored nail polish and
I've heard so many good things about
Zoya so I'm excited for it oh I have the
prices pulled up because I like to let
you guys know how much these things are
to see if it's worth it money-wise and
the concealer this size concealer this
is five dollars and six cents and this
is a full size so yeah this is eight
dollars so ready already you have the
price of the bag with these two items
and I didn't up paint my nails
specifically so that I could swashing
this nail polish for you guys cuz I'm a
nice gal like that okay oh it's really a
pig it's not sheer at all wow I'm
impressed
this is going to be really sloppy swatch
guys silly
I'm gonna do two coats to show you oh by
the way this nail polish is called
jackeline so so this is what it looks
like it's a really nice like off-white
nude it's really pretty
this watch is terrible oh my god my
nails look awful okay I'm done here so
this is exciting I like this the next
thing in here is the only thing that I'm
kind of like uh-huh that I got and it's
this juice beauty lip gloss I hate lip
gloss I mean if I honestly I don't own
any lip gloss and if I do it has to be
like an opaque color that's really
really really not sticky at all at all I
don't like the stickiness this whole
thing hey what's up I'm not fat
no so this is the lip gloss and it's
like let me swatch this oh it smells
really really good just not a fan of
this color it might give this to my mom
I'm just going to let it go to waste you
know but this is the color right here I
don't know it's very shimmery it's just
it's not me but it does smell really
good and you know I'll give this to my
mom okay so there's two more things in
the bag and um this thing is the new me
finishing serum and it's what it looks
like
this is cute this is a conditions and
seals treats your hair it's like an oil
for your hair which is awesome this
thing is oh crap I forgot to tell you
the price of this what what is wrong
with me this this is a full size lip lip
gloss or whatever and this by itself is
$18 this thing alone $18 so that's
that's awesome
I get that you're a fan of lip gloss
that's awesome um
this is well the full-size of this is
$29 so I don't know how much this sample
size is it wasn't on the website when I
went to go check let me smell this
because got a smell everything
I just Mel's like regular oil does smell
bad
it smells smells good I'm really excited
about this because I love finishing
serums and I'm all about taming my
taming this I'm all about it so that's
really nice and then the last thing that
I got is the thing that I wanted I got
the San Tropez instant glow body lotion
and San Tropez is a really expensive
tanning thing at what it's expensive
I think it's expensive so this the full
size of this is $18 I don't know how
much this is but it's a pretty big
sample size like it's a pretty decent
size this is amazing 50 milliliters 1.69
fluid ounces so it's like bigger than an
average foundation so like foundation
that you have on your face it has more
than that so that's a pretty good sample
so overall guys this bag is definitely
worth more than the $10 I paid for it
it's crazy I mean they gave really good
things this month this brands expensive
new me is expensive and they give you a
hundred and ten dollars off of any new
me product that's a huge discount that
that's awesome
the soya is an expensive nail polish
like they give good things this month I
really like this bag I totally think
it's worth it I think you really should
try out if see if you don't already and
it's just it's fun for the makeup lover
for the haircare lover I don't know it's
good it's like a it's like a surprise
every month it's like Christmas every
month you know I am joy FC a lot so
thank you so much for watching I hope
this wasn't awkward like
I don't know I'm like in a hurry so it's
like all over the place
I don't know what I'm doing here and I
hope you liked this video please
