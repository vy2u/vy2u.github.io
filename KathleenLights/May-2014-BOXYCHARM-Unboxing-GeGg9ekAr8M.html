another monthly subscription box that
I'm going to be sharing with you guys
this box is called boxycharm and it is a
monthly subscription service just like
itse that is the one that I do like
religiously on my channel just to give
you guys a reference it is that kind of
box where you get makeup and skincare
and hair care and all that good stuff
the only thing is that boxycharm is
twenty one dollars a month is a little
bit pricey but the difference between
boxycharm and like oopsy and Birchbox
and stuff like that is that most of the
time you get full sized products in your
box I know a lot of people hate Birchbox
because they pay $10 a month and they
get samples like this big in their
Birchbox and I know that's pretty
frustrating so you don't get that hassle
with boxycharm the box I'm going to be
sharing with you is the main box and it
is the Mother's Day box they don't send
you products according to like a survey
that you take for example like if see
you take a survey before you join and
then they send you products according to
the questions you answered boxycharm is
not like that they send you the same box
to everyone which is the good and a bad
thing if you think about it it is a bad
thing because you feel like maybe you're
not going to get things that you would
normally like but it also is a good
thing because sometimes I'll get
something in my Ipsy bag and then
somebody else will get something better
and I'm like oh I really wanted that in
my bag you don't have that issue with
boxy charts it's everybody gets the same
stuff okay so the oh let's try that
again
okay so when you open up the box this is
what it looks like inside it comes with
a card and it says Mother's Day and it
just tells you that this month's box is
Mother's Day inspired and the great
thing about this box in particular that
I'm actually really impressed with is
that it gives you on the back of the
card a list of everything you got in
your box and the price how much it
retails for which is amazing because you
guys know that I do my empty bag
unboxings and I tell you guys the prices
of each product and I have to go on the
nc website and check in and all I get
stuff but this actually gives you a list
of the things you are getting and how
it retails for which is great and then
this is the beautiful box inside so the
first thing I see here is this nail
Couture Beauty Beverly Hills nail polish
remover it comes with 15 tabs oh my god
I swear it's like impossible for me to
open anything oh my god this is Kathleen
proof so this is what it looks like it's
just a white little container and it
comes with 15 pads oh my god this smells
so incredibly good acetone free fast and
effective sweet berry blossom Wow
oh well I'm really really impressed with
this because I always get acetone free
nail polish remover even though it takes
longer to take off my nail polish
because I cannot stand how try my nails
get or even the scent of any nail polish
remover and this smells amazing it's no
so good that I would not mind having a
perfume with the scent this Lauren B
beauty nail polish remover pads is
full-size and it retails for $15 this is
amazing I cannot wait to take off mani
apologize
the next thing in the bag is this I mean
in the bag I'm so used to saying in the
bag because of Ipsy No the next thing in
the Box is this mirabela lipstick I've
heard a lot of Mirabella I think we've
gotten a couple of Mirabella things in
Ipsy if I'm not mistaken I'm not sure
but huh oh my god I'm dropping
everything but this is what the lipstick
looks like it's a nice little sleek
silver packaging and the color is really
really nice it's like a nice fuchsia
berry color and this is in the shade
tantrum
let me just so watch it on my hand oh my
god it's really really smooth and creamy
and yeah I really like this color and
this is actually a good lipstick because
it is paraben free and lead
which is great and this is obviously a
full-size lipstick which retails for $22
which is more than you paid for your
boxycharm anyways so so impressed with
this lipstick the color is beautiful the
next thing in the Box is this little
pink kabuki brush and it is really
really soft this is from the brand
called Farrow cosmetics and it is their
pink fubuki brush not a kabuki brush
it's a faux Buki brush I guess like for
your face and a clever apply your
finishing powder mineral powders or
blend your blush with this this is
pretty darn soft and the color wins like
it would just look so pretty just
sitting there because the color is pink
and I love me some pink and this brush
retails for $20 just pretty experiences
the next things in the bag are samples
so I don't have the prices of them but
they are from the brand called Novak's
and they're olive oil and argan oil hair
masks which I am over the moon about
because I'm obsessed with argan oil and
I'm obsessed with olive oil in terms of
using them on my hair they're so good
for your hair and super super nourishing
so I'm really really excited that I got
this and even though it is a sample is a
pretty big packet I'm sure I can get a
couple of uses out of this and just seal
them properly and put them in a nice
safe place I'm sure I can get a couple
of uses out of these it says they treat
dryness split end and frizz ease while
conditioning your hair and adding a
healthy shine so excited about these I
love hair masks and then the last thing
in the Box is this big ol box right here
and it is a lavish hand cream from tide
lily the card it says treat your hands
with a luxurious and soothing blend of
natural oils mango butters coconut
jojoba avocado and vitamin E well that
all sounds amazing
those ingredients are awesome
and the packaging is so beautiful I'm
not a fan of hand creams but I hope it's
nice and not too greasy let's see it is
a very very subtle scent and it's just a
very soft very calming scent on the back
of the bottle it says Bali mango Lily
and teak wood and actually this is
really good for those of you who get
headaches from hand creams because the
fragrance is so strong so this is very
very nice and subtle and I'm really
impressed with the scent actually and
this hand cream retails for $20 so
overall this box was worth seventy seven
dollars not including the samples
because those were samples but it had
four full-size products in these box and
none of them were under $15 each item so
a $77 value for a box you only paid $21
for is a crazy good deal I was extremely
impressed with everything I got in this
box I loved every single thing I'm going
to leave the boxycharm website down
below so you can check it out if you
want to subscribe or just browse the
website to get more of an idea of what
you'll be getting each month
I'm just over the moon about this box I
love the concept I love that they give
you the prices and they give you details
of every single product and the fact
that they give you mostly full-size
products in this box is just it's great
this is a great monthly subscription
service at least from this one box I've
tried I am sold so thank you guys so
much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
