my monthly if si bag unboxing I got my
bag pretty early this month but with all
the technical difficulties I've been
having lately I haven't been able to sit
down and film so it's just been sitting
there just waiting for me to open it so
let's do this thing
the random question before I start this
video um I'm thinking of doing a meet-up
here in Miami but I don't want to be
like a total loser and do the
meet-and-greet and then nobody shows up
so if you would be able to or you would
be interested and coming to a meeting
right here in Miami leave a comment down
below and I'll see you know I'll see if
I'll do it I'm not exactly sure if I'm
going to because I don't know how many
people would go but I'm definitely
thinking about it so just leave a
comment down below letting me know if
you totally would go okay now to the
important stuff so this is what the bag
looks like this month it's really really
pretty actually has like a bunch of
little leaves on them and it has like
that eco-friendly material actually
really love this bag so yeah then when
you open up its the card and this as of
fresh picks which is the theme for this
month but I mean so the first thing I
see here is this event a a viene of an A
if only I could pronounce things but it
says it's a thermal spring water that is
supposed to be soothing and softening
and it's for sensitive skin I have a
feeling this kind of works like fix+
or like those Evian sprays ever seen at
sephora I'm not exactly sure it doesn't
really have a scent at all um fix+ does
I don't really know if this is like
fixed plus it just says pure thermal
spring water packaged in the sterile
environment at the source so yeah I'm
really excited to use this because I
love any type of spray like this where I
could just spray it on my face and
immediately feel refreshed and stuff
since I have such a dry skin and
hopefully I love this um the full-sized
version of this which
I'm not exactly sure if this is the full
size or not I doubt it I doubt this is
the full size but the full-sized version
of this actually retails for $18 so it's
a pretty pricey little product so yeah I
hope it's good the next thing in my bag
is this booboo cover-up concealer it
looks like it's a pretty good match for
me let's see
oh my god it's super super creamy wow
this feels really really nice on my skin
it is just a little bit lighter than my
skin right now because going into spring
and summer I tend to get a little bit
darker but this would probably work
really well underneath my eyes because
it is very creamy so maybe stay tuned to
the end of the video and by the looks of
it this is a full-sized product and this
retails for $19.99 which is pretty
expensive for a concealer so I mean not
too expensive but it's not drugstore
I'll tell you that much so that's
awesome that we got this next thing in
my bag is something that I'm pretty sure
everybody got and it is a Pacifica
eyeshadow duo we get Pacifica all the
time in RFC bags and I actually really
like this brand they do sell it at
Target if you're wondering and I got
mine in purple and like a white color I
really wanted the brown one but let's
see
mmm-hmm
the lilac is actually really pretty but
yeah the lilac is actually really pretty
it's like a satin finish lilac color but
the white is a epic fail like an epic
fail it's just super chunky and glittery
so and I'm not a fan of the white but
the greyish purple color is really nice
and I was looking all over the Pacifica
website and I could not find this little
duel anywhere so I don't know how much
this retails for the next thing in my
bag is this hang-ten classic sport
natural sunscreen with SPF 50 and can we
talk about this packaging really fast
because look how cute this bottle is I
love it already
just cuz the bottle is cute but anyway
it's just your classic sunscreen it's
water-resistant its protect and nourish
your skin with our non greasy
lightweight naturally scented sunscreen
let's see how true that is
oh it could definitely smell the SPF but
it doesn't really bother me and actually
smells pretty Pleasant I kind of like
the smell of sunscreen I'm not gonna lie
I'm really excited that they put this in
our bag because I mean everybody can use
some sunscreen especially this time of
year and the full-sized version of this
actually retails for $12.99 so yeah I
love this bottle I just I love this one
and the last thing in my bag is this
yeah the last thing in my bag is this
balanced guru no frizz hair oil organic
sesame and lemongrass balancing oil
balance your frizzy hair it's safe how
did you know that my hair was a first of
all it says controls frizz and flyaways
even in human and tropical weather Miami
leaves no residue it has argan oil
jojoba oil and tammany oil will help
nourish and repair your hair and this is
organic and cruelty-free this sounds
like a bottle of amazing I'm not gonna
lie woah this has a scent but I don't I
can't quite put my finger on it it's not
a bad step but I know it smells like
something but I don't know what but yeah
I am so excited to use this I love hair
oils and I just ran out of my argan oil
for my hair so I'm so excited my hair
gets really really frizzy I will update
you guys on this to tell you if it's
good or not
I would definitely let you guys know
very excited for this pretty excited and
this retails for $13 I'm not exactly
sure if this size retails for $13 or a
bigger size but that's actually pretty
good for a hair oil and if it does all
those things that says it will then it's
great so yeah guys that is everything I
got in this month's if seabag leave a
comment down below letting me know what
you guys got in your bag and if you
liked any of the products and if you
want to see a couple of these things in
action then just
so I was looking at my glam room earlier
today to see what the prices were for
the products I got so I knew I was
getting the concealer which is why I
didn't wear under eye concealer so I can
demo it for you guys this should be
enough
so it seems to have decent coverage any
concealer creasing on me unless I set it
with a powder which I have not set it
with a powder yet but the coverage is
nice and I mean it's not super full
coverage but it isn't cakey at all I
have dry skin as you guys know and it
didn't feel like it was tugging or
clinging on to dry patches at all
actually
really really really really like this so
this gets a a plus from me I'm going to
prime my eyelids with Urban Decay's
primer potion and I'm going to try to
use the Pacifica duo I'm going to use
the purple on my lids and this as a
highlight even though I know this is
going to be a disaster but hopefully
this looks really pretty like as a light
wash over my lids
so this color is actually really pretty
I wouldn't exactly pair it with this lip
but the purple is nice and pigmented
it's like a muted gray purple which I
really like those shades obviously I
would add like an outer corner you know
deepen it up give it more dimension than
just one color but I really like this
great purple a lot I was a fan of the
pigmentation of the white but let's try
it anyway
I mean it's decent I like the gold Sheen
it has but I'm not a fan of the chunks
of glitter that just fall off so I mean
yeah I already tried this but let's just
use it again the sake of this video I
love this already I just looked up some
reviews on this and this has like 5
stars people really really like this so
I'm so excited for it
it feels so refreshing and my hair is an
absolute mess right now it's like super
frizzy and gross I'm about to wash it I
want to just try the oil at the very
tips of my hair like at the tip of my
braid just no because it smells like
what is this smell like
Emilia can you smell this and tell me
what this smells like because this is
this big smell but I don't I kept my
finger on it oh that's exactly what it
is yes oh my god yes that's exactly what
it is yes guys I'm gonna I'm a fool
it smells like lemons and I love me the
smell of lemons I have a feeling I'm
really going to like this seem to
moisturize my tips really well so yeah I
will like I said earlier update you on
this so anyways that is the end of this
video thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye
