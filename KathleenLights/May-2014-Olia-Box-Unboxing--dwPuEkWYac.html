my main olya unboxing and then these
olya unboxing two times you for this I
will link them down below if you're
interested in seeing the other months
but this month is the May box and this
is when it comes like it comes with your
bag the little card that teaches you how
to preserve your jewelry and they always
come with these amazing like
eco-friendly reusable bags that's what I
really really love about this monthly
subscription service because you could
always use these over and over again for
traveling for anything really actually I
already have one bag full of bobby pins
and hair ties a lot of stuff that I keep
in my drawer so these will always come
in handy it also comes with these little
things that made a hot mess in last
month's video so let's just put that
away so if you don't already know
olia box is a monthly subscription
service where you paint you know
twenty-five dollars a month for 35
dollars a month and it is a Jewelry
subscription so you get really nice
trendy pieces to your door every month
which is perfect for somebody who
doesn't really keep up with trends or
doesn't like shopping for jewelry and
stuff like that this box is definitely
for you this month I have the $35 bag to
share with you guys the $35 one comes
with three to four jewelry pieces and
the $25 one comes with two to three so
the first thing in the bag are these
really pretty bangles I absolutely love
this style of bracelets I just find them
so so classy and gypsy like I love
bangles I can never wear them because
they just flip right off of me because
my wrist is pretty small but these
aren't actually too too big I hate those
bangles that they sell they're just like
enormous these are pretty okay
I just really love how like the cream
and the gold look together I find it so
elegant and nice and yeah this is Juri
piece number one next thing in the bag
is super cute they are these little
rings right here pretty sure they are
knuckle rings I am obsessed with knuckle
rings I love them so
so it comes with two of them one has
diamonds all around it and the other one
is just completely gold all the way and
what I love about it is that the one
with diamonds all around it is like a
rose gold like a bronzy color and then
this one is a true gold so I love the
two-toned jewelry I love two-tone Dorey
and mix matching them so this is really
cute and I know I'm gonna get so much
use out of this oh I love love love this
they're actually really comfortable to
wear and they don't just slip off my
fingers when I shake my hand so that's a
good thing and then the third and last
piece in the back is amazing it is this
beautiful really really long necklace
with this at the end you guys have no
idea how obsessed I am with this stone
whatever this stone is called I'm sure a
bunch of you guys are gonna let me know
but it is that really beautiful
turquoise rock that makes sense and it
has this beautiful little choral dangly
thing at the end of it this is so like
boho chic I love this so much this is
absolutely beautiful it is so perfect
for spring and summer and I just it's so
long I love how long it is and I see
myself wearing this a ton this is
definitely my favorite thing in the bag
this month it is so so so beautiful I
would definitely buy this if I saw this
on the street because this is just like
my style I love everything about it I
just love how long necklaces like this
with like a statement piece at the
bottom dress up anything you can just
throw on a tank top put this on and you
will look nice and I don't know beachy
and boho I really like this I love long
necklaces okay so that is everything I
got in my olya box this month I really
really liked it especially the knuckle
rings and the necklace I think they're
absolutely beautiful if you're kind of
on the fence about this subscription box
I will definitely go with the $25 one
and just try it out because I think that
$25 one is just as good as the $35 one
so if you're on the fence about it just
try it out for the 25 dollars and if you
like it then you like it it's just
really different for me since I'm so
like all about makeup it's nice to get
jewelry every once in a
so that's great thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
