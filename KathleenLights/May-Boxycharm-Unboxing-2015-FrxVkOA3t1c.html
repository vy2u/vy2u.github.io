Celine is licking my pants today's video
is going to be my May boxycharm unboxing
I don't have anything on my lips maybe I
should put your on my chair
what are you doing the reporter I'm
about to film a video silly boy get off
all right
so let's open this alright alright so
this is what the box looks like on the
inside this month seen this month's
theme okay listen
since I have my wisdom tooth is like
infected and I'm waiting to take it out
unlike all like because they gave me
something to like ease the pain so if
I'm acting a little weird in this video
that's why this month's theme is bold
and beautiful alright so let's look
through these worms and see what we got
so the first product is this nail polish
right here and you probably can't tell
but I love nail polish this is the
Lauren B Beauty nail polish this is
full-size of course and this retails for
$18 a DES Espenson
for nail polish my friends we actually
have gotten this R and in our boxycharm
before I think the last one is like a
red color that I have and I really love
it I think the bottle is just really
cute to like sit on your vanity I'm
weird like that but yeah I hope this
color is nice and pigmented and smooth I
would totally swatch it for you guys but
I've got se find me an oasis on my nails
right now okay oh this is cute this is a
brush this is the body Aughra fee brow
brush full-size of course this is pretty
much just like an eyebrow brush but
what's really cool is that it comes with
a spoolie on the other end I already
have like a Holy Grail eyebrow brush but
what would make that brush perfect as if
it had this on the end
it doesn't so I'm gonna keep this closed
nearby because I like this this is also
good to like comb on your eyelashes I
don't know these are really good brushes
you can never go wrong with this did I
tell you the price that is full-size and
that is $19 okay next thing in here is
in this little bag like a little potion
this says lip the lip bar on it that's a
little like this packaging totally
reminds me of charmed it doesn't it look
like this is the lip bar lipstick it is
a full-size lipstick and it is $20 it
has vitamin E shea butter avocado oil
and yeah it says it's supposed to
moisturize soften your lips oh that is a
really really pretty color this is the
shade kiss me I don't know if the
cameras even picking up how like
beautiful that is I don't know if you
could see it but yeah this is a really
nice color this packaging reminds me of
Kat Von D like witchcraft or I don't
know but it is a really pretty color
it's perfect for like the spring and
summer so good job on the color
selection buck see Sharon good job this
is full-size and it's $20 and I think I
always of it okay so the next items are
both in this little thing at the bottom
of the bluff and the first one is model
ko bronze shimmer bronzing powder for
face and body ooh I'm a treat I like me
a bronze shimmer oh I thought this was
gonna be a loose powder I'm kind of glad
it's not I'm kind of glad i lo v I
haven't even swatched it yet but I could
tell I love it already if you guys saw
my bronzer video you know I'm like all
about the bronzer life but this is so
beautiful it gives like a golden sheen
it has like little glitters in it but oh
my god this is like perfect for spring
and summer I love warm bronzy shimmer
bronzers I'm all about it so yeah I'm
really excited about this this is a
full-size product and retails for $22
and then the last thing in this little
pouch ope
pouchy this is the brow trio buy body
ography it's another body ography
product it's the audiography is central
brow trio this is full-size everything
in this box was full size and this
retails for $19 is a like eyeshadow I
mean brow shadow eyeshadow and this is
what it looks like this is actually
pretty interesting
it features three matt brow powders
flattering for all hair colors so i'm
assuming if you were a redhead this
would be good i would probably use this
this color right here um and then this
would be great if you have like black
hair they feel nice and you could also
use these as eyeshadows because you know
there's no rules this would also be
really good for like a makeup artist
this is a nice on-the-go brow product I
use cork eyeshadow by Mac like every day
excuse my brows they're a little bold
today I went I went overboard I could
actually say that I went overboard on my
brows but I like this I'm gonna be
trying that out I like it okay guys so
that was bad that was everything I
thought in my made boxycharm
um let me pick something up that was
everything I got in this month's
boxycharm I am very very pleased I don't
think there's anything that I'm like
Abajo that was a weird face I love this
color like a lot so yeah thank you guys
