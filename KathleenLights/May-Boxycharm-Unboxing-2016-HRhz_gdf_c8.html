my maid Max Sherman Backson I'm sorry
this video is going up later in the
month actually got my boxycharm
yesterday because I'm thinking on
vacation so I'm so excited I'm just
gonna break open this tape with my
bridge okay so this is what the books it
looks like this month oh I'm gonna grab
the first thing I noticed right away
which is this guy I actually knew that
this was gonna be in the box this month
and I'm so excited for this this is a
makeup geek powder blush makeup geek is
gonna be releasing a ton of new blushes
very soon at the end of this month I
believe the 25th but don't quote me all
her new blushes it's gonna be amazing
and it's so exciting because if you are
a subscriber to boxycharm this month you
get one of the new makeup geek blushes
how amazing is that I think that is
unreal so this is the color I got I
actually don't know if everybody got the
same color but I got mine in the shade
covet and it's Openings I don't even
know what this oh my god this is so
beautiful okay first of all let's talk
about this packaging makeup geek had
blushes in the past but she reformulated
them and changed the packaging and this
packaging is literally stunning look at
this it has a mirror which is amazing
has a magnetic closure oh my gosh I love
the color okay so I'm not gonna go on
and on about this blush anymore but I do
feel like this month's box was worth it
just for this because it's very exciting
this is obviously a full-size blush and
this retails for $15 okay with NYX dis
blue box yeah Catherine Malandrino style
de Paris perfume this is actually a
full-size perfume oh wow and this is $20
let's see I want to say we've gotten
this brand before
for some reason when I saw the packaging
on this I was like I'm not gonna like
that perfume that looks like something
that would be sold and illogical but
scent is so similar to a perfume I own
and I can't I don't know at least right
away like as soon as I spray it it
smells like something something that I
already owned but now that it's drying a
little bit it's starting to smell a
little bit more like pine if you have
box determined you got this this month
let me know what perfumes is this remind
you of cuz it's on the tip of my tongue
but I don't know honestly I do like this
more like with the initial spray I don't
love it that much once it's dried down
but we shall see okay let's go this one
misses Tokyo it has a little elephants
on it this is the Ella and Mila
nail-polish this is a full-size nail
polish let's see what color this is
in pistach oh my gosh how cute I love
mint nail polish I was recently wearing
a mint nail-polish I love them I love
this bottle I love this little elephant
I think I'm gonna look into this brand
well let's we'll see we'll see if it
doesn't chip we'll see the formula but
yes I know that a lot of people don't
like getting nail polishes but I am a
nail polish hoarder so I love getting
them in my boxes okay so two more things
in zip oaks a clear brow gel from the
brand the brow gel by Tanja crooks this
is a clear brow gel let's see my
favorite clear brow gel is the Anastacio
one because it's like freaking glue for
your brows but I'm definitely going to
try this one out let me open it it says
it's water-resistant so that makes me
think that this might be a good one
this is a full-size product and this
retails for $20 okay so the last thing
in the Box is dis this is the pure
double ego double ended eyeliner this is
full size and it is $21 I am so excited
actually love up here it's a great brand
its high-end they sell it at Ulta and
they have great products so the fact
that this is in the box is really really
exciting dual ended eyeliner and I'm
soom that this is the shade Tasmania
which is a brown and I'm not complaining
I think that Brown is very wearable
chocolatey Brown and let's see the oh
nice nice this is actually really cool
because it has kind of like a chocolatey
brown pencil eyeliner and on the other
side it's a liquid liner but it's not
black it's like black brown it's almost
black but not quite oh wait no there's
one more thing there's one more thing in
the box and father's six products in the
box this month that's crazy okay so this
is the last product this is the star
looks looks lip liner full-size and this
retails for nineteen fifty and it says
star looks hearts boxycharm
on the actual packaging so I'm assuming
this is kind of like a collab star looks
did with boxycharm oh it's a retractable
whoa this is not the color I expected to
come out of this packaging doesn't that
look like a coral like a bright coral
and this totally looks like a nude it's
in the shade charmed so I totally think
this is definitely like a boxycharm
collab really pretty spring color though
really pretty okay guys so that was
everything I got in this month's boxy
serum the overall value of the box this
month was 106 dollars yet you pay 21 I'm
actually very very very very excited

think that the box this month was really
really awesome leave me a comment down
