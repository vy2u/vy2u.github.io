mob back to Sherman back before you
start on this video I want to say this
little dent right here driving me crazy
I'm going to fix it in this video good
so hey guys have you been um I
officially have a cold I definitely will
edit out all of the sneezes all of the
edit all of that out so I was going to
post this video that you're watching
right now on Monday and today I was
going to post these in day a makeup
tutorial I want to recreate her look
from the MTV Awards and according to you
guys in the comments section in my last
video you really want me to do it as
well but I had to buy something I was
missing something I really wanted to use
in that video and that gets here in the
mail tomorrow so I'm going to film that
video tomorrow and then I'll post that
on Monday if all goes well yes today is
a bus to share video and also I know I
got my Ipsy bag today isn't that strange
I always get my Ipsy bag like at the end
of the month but I will be filming that
video soon as well and that should be
coming up in the future as well anyway I
feel like my box to share videos or
where I give you kind of like updates
but I don't really have anything to tell
you guys right now besides the fact that
how cool is my shirt I love this shirt
so very much I will say though Amelia
came over the other day and I was
wearing this shirt and she was like what
Clarissa explains it all and I freaked
out but is this show that old I mean
because I remember in a millionaire of
the same age I used to watch it all the
Tarte but it was mainly because my
sister watched it all the time and she's
older than me so maybe that's why I
would watch oh my gosh
anyway so let's jump into my bucks shoes
all I have on is a little bit of
concealer underneath my eyes and I did
put on some mascara on my top lashes and
obviously I have my eyebrows on which
funny story there's a brow product in
this box you guys know I always like to
try these products on camera and I had
no idea that we're going to be a brow
product in there and just like out of
habit I did my brows first before
opening this box because I always give a
little peek before filming the video and
when I saw the bra frogs I was like oh
my gosh but it's a brow powder and I
always do brow pencil and then go over
it with powder and I haven't done that
today I haven't put powder on top so I
guess I'll just put a little bit of
powder so we can see how that works
let's just get into this video I'm sorry
this intro is way too long this is the
card in the box this month and it says
makeup in sorry
yes it is you also get a little coupon
thing which is like a monthly
subscription service of like healthy
food I believe this is a $35 off your
first box coupon that is crazy how much
are these boxes and I just have deja vu
have they put this coupon on the bus
before because I remember looking at a
coupon and being like $35 off how much
is the box originally I'm in one of
those moves today where sometimes the
dayquil makes me a little bit anyway you
get $35 off your first box which i think
is amazing so the first thing in the Box
is this this is by Tonya crooks and it
is the brow gel I've seen this brand a
lot actually in the past this is the
convertible brow and it retails for a
$35 this is in the shade 0-2 and it's
called the convertible brow because it
says you can use this both wet and dry I
personally probably would never use this
wet I always like to use powders to kind
of set down my brow pencil but if you're
someone who's into brow pomade if you
like that kind of thing you might like
this wet because it gives you kind of
like that pomade consistency each
compact has a warm neutral and ash tone
to allow you to mix and match to your
perfect shade I'm just Louie so in the
Box it also came with a little brush
this is also from Tanja crooks the brow
gel this is her brow brush and this
brush by the way retails for $14 I'm
going to take the spoolie side and I'm
just going to brush my brows up I hadn't
put gel in them or anything yet but
fully works really well I mean it's just
fully but some fully suck so I'm just
going to brush up the hairs and there
are some parts here that look a little
bold and I usually always fill those
parts in with a powder I always use one
from the brand the balm but it's nice to
try out new products so I don't I don't
know what color I think I'm more this
one it's the one that's the warmest my
eyebrows aren't like red by any means
but they're definitely not ashy
so I'm taking the angled side and I'm
just going to fill in the little bald
area actually I'm going to mix them I'm
going to mix it with this dark one
these angled brushes are really good for
brows because it lets you get really
really precise and wiggle it here in the
front to create kind of like a faded
look and I feel like it just looks a
little bit more natural that way then
I'm just going to do the same little
ting ting and this eyebrow okay so next
up we have this this guy this is
actually funny because this is labeled
as a contour brush that I a round
contour brush this is from the brand
crown brush if you have fun in brushes
from his brand in the past in boxycharm
and I really like the brushes but if I'm
going to be honest with you I don't
think I would ever use this for
contouring I mean you totally can you
can you can but to me this is more of
like a foundation type of brush I mean
at least I would use this with
foundation and not so much contouring so
I'm not going to sit here and pretend
like that I would complement this
because I probably would I am going to
use it today to apply my foundation so
we can see how that goes but I'm going
to put this down for a second because
this guy is very interesting this is
like a collaboration between boxycharm
and temp too and it is there liquid glow
it's a limited edition collaboration
with boxycharm temptu introduces liquid
glow it's first hand applied highlighter
because I believe up until this point
everything temptu makes you have to use
with like their air brush applicator but
this one is different
it says it's formulated to deliver a
radiantly luminous complexion or to
illuminate all over I want to try this
out today in two ways I want to try it
mix in with my foundation and I want to
try it on the tops of my cheekbones
might be over glow overkill but we're
going to do that for this video alright
let's do this so I'm actually going to
take my Georgia our money power fabric
foundation just because this is more
like a matte foundation so I want to see
how much glow the liquid go the liquid
glow gives it not liquid go two pumps of
the foundation and the temptu
highlighter says to shake well and can
apply just a couple dots of this to the
foundation what's happening it's not
come
now cynical stopper on this ah that was
my fault
you guys cannot see this right now but
there is highlight all over the place
there is a liquid glow all over the
place it's all over my shirt I'm going
to clean this and then I'm going to be
right back
now that I have cleaned that disaster
let's go back to what I was doing I need
to wash this shirt as soon as I'm done
filming this video I had to take the
foundation of my hand because it was
like sliding everywhere I was trying to
clean but like I was doing to pump the
foundation and then I'm going to take
some of this the problem with this was I
obviously squeezed it way too hard
reading I'm a savage and I popped and it
destroyed everything
so don't squeeze this too hard nothing
was coming out because there was like a
blockage at the tip but I took it off
and now it's good to go so I'm just
gonna do like one maybe two two and I'm
going to take the back of a brush and
just mix that into the foundation gonna
spread this onto my face okay so now
let's take the brush and once Turnbull
and Matt it quite funny that I chose to
use this foundation because I actually
don't like how this foundation applies
with a brush so I don't know what I'm
doing here today I'm off my game people
I'm like really off my game oh you got
foundation on my eyebrow so I definitely
think adding the liquid glue helps it
look a little bit more luminous usually
I hate how this foundation looks with a
brush I want to say hey but I always
always use this foundation with a Beauty
Blender because if I don't it does cling
onto my dry skin but with that liquid
glow I don't feel like it's doing that
you guys know I don't typically use
these kinds of brushes for foundation
anyway so even though I think this is
good I probably will still continue to
use my Beauty Blender I feel like adding
that liquid glow just gave it a subtle
like super subtle healthy glow to the
skin okay so now I'm going to take my
little wedding wild unicorn brush how
cute Aziz Oh cute and I'm going to take
some of this on the back of my hand and
I'm going to apply this to the tops of
my cheekbones with this brush I think I
like it even more with the fingers
actually the brush applied it nicely but
it just blends into the skin so much
nicer with your fingers I will say
though I did apply under-eye concealer
before filming this video so on this
side right at the top where the powder
and the liquid meet it does look a
little strange but on the rest of my
cheek where there is no power I think it
looks so pretty I definitely think this
is a more natural liquid illuminator I
did like two of the years and it is
still very subtle but still not so at
the same time it's kind of like a lit
from within kind of liquid illuminator
and I love that actually that is the
liquid glow and now we could move on to
the other stuff or the other thing you
see do you see the the liquid glow that
got everywhere yeah so the last thing in
the Box is this palette right here this
is the highlight and contour palette by
the brand EB or IV or IB why I'm not
sure and oh I didn't tell you but this
retails for $29.50 and this brush
retails for $24.99
sorry like I said off my game today but
this palette retails for $40 one of
those typical like contour kits that has
the three highlights and then the three
contour powders at the bottom it does
come with a mirror which is nice oh it's
actually a really good mirror okay so
even though I already put on concealer
and I set my under eye concealer with
like some translucent powder I'm going
to take these two shades right here
okay so for the powder I think this one
might be a little bit too ashy on me but
I'm going to focus on these two I'm
going to take this like Mac's fan brush
and I think I'm going to mix both of
them yes absolutely and go in like that
I didn't set my foundation by the way I
find that with the Georgia and money
foundation I don't really have to set it
sometimes bronzer will skip on the skin
if you don't set your foundation but
that looks like it's going on fine fun
story when I was taking my 15 I don't
know why I just thought of this I guess
because I just looked at my ear but fun
story while I'm contouring not fun story
gutter while I was taking my pictures
for my 15 the photographer I wanted to
edit out my birthmark on my arm this one
and he also asked me if I wanted him to
round out my ear so that it wasn't else
looking like this not gonna lie a part
of me was like yes round out my ear but
I was like oh no that is my ear and the
thing was my birthmark I was like wait a
minute what's wrong on my birthmark my
ears I understand they're a little
pointy cool is all my birthmark anyway
so he did not edit my birthmark or my
ear moral of the story is don't let
photographers edit your ears because
your ears are fine the way they are the
older I got the more I learned to love
my ears and even though I don't like to
pick up my hair and I don't like them to
show in certain photos whatever they're
my ears you can call me Keebler which is
actually when my cousin's call me
literally they're Virgenes Keebler I
actually really like how this turned out
I think the contour looks good I might
have applied too much but I really just
wanted to see how it was going to apply
and I blend it out really well they were
a little bit powdery but once you tap it
off you're perfectly fine you will apply
too much okay guys so that completes
this video this was everything that was
in my buck see Sherm this month it is a
mask and the overall value of this box
is over a hundred and forty dollars and
whenever I tell you I did the math my
calculator did the mask

comment down below so we can discuss it
amongst us friends yeah that completes
