my bucks sherman boxin today's video is
going to go up late and I know that for
a fact because I was supposed to post it
56 minutes ago and now is when I'm
filming it so I'm so sorry I told you
guys May was gonna be cray I told you
guys I'm gonna have wild uploads for the
rest of May just bear with me forgive me
I love you okay so today's your boxing
and I'm so excited but I'm also very
tired so drink drink drink my coffee
okay so if you're new here I like to try
on the products as I go so I always open
the box first just to see what's inside
so I know more or less what I should be
putting on my face so this is what
please buxie sherman looks like oh my
card is Bane the FEMA is boxy bash and I
washed out the Sun is so bright right
now it's insane okay so the first
product in the box is this guy and I'm
actually not gonna be trying this out
today because I've used it several times
and I already know how I feel about it
but this is the cover fix blurring
primer and I love cover effects it's
actually one of my favorite brands I
feel like they rarely disappoint me and
this is a great primer but I feel like
for me it's not my favorite it is one of
those pore filling primers it's not as
bad as benefit professional you know
that's a huge favorite for everyone but
I don't like that primer at all it's not
that silicone it is one of those pore
fillers and I don't know I just I've
used it a few times and I don't find
that it's anything special just because
I like very dewy illuminating primers
because my skin is so dry but maybe if
you have like normal skin or oily skin
you might like this cover effects is
amazing so I think it's great that we
got it in the box and this retails for
$38 okay there's more than the box so
good stuff alright so the next thing in
the Box is this brush I feel like I am
falling asleep sitting on this chair oh
man this video is not very entertaining
I'm sorry what who is this from I
remember heard of the term sleepy drunk
like when you're so sleepy or you feel
drunk gets me so this is from the brand
Aesthetica and it is their p-12 face
brush I've never heard of this brand
before but we are going to apply some
and blush with this brush because I do
have highlight on already I just don't
have those other things okay so I'm just
gonna take my Too Faced sweethearts
bronzer I like that it's kind of rounded
at the top but it's not very pointy I
have a lot of brushes that look like
this but they're a lot pointy air and I
feel like they contour you a little bit
too harshly it's kind of weird but I
like the shape of this one it contours
and it bronzes at the same time I wish I
knew how to use my right hand for things
because I feel like like all the way
over here with my left hand but if I
just knew how to use this hand that
would be great all of a sudden I feel
alive now that I have this bronzer on
there's something about bronzer man it
just makes me feel alive okay so I also
feel like this would be a nice blush
brush look so I'm gonna dip it into the
doesn't I'm you guessed it toasted
cinnamon I usually like fluffier brushes
like this is pretty dense for blush at
least for me because I like a very light
wash of blush if you like to pack on the
blush then this brush would be perfect
but I mean it's not packing it on too
much but if it was a very pigmented
blush like I would I wouldn't put it on
with this but like I said if you like a
debauch you would like it this bro hmm
I'm out of it this morning excuse me
okay so I actually like this brush more
than I thought I would I don't know why
I was misjudging it that was like that
was so mean of me I don't know but this
is a full-size brush obviously and that
brush retails for $27 alright so there
are more brushes in the box and they're
also from the brand's Aesthetica yes
this is the 3-piece eye trio and this
retails for $45 but I mean you get three
brushes an angled brush like this it's a
little bit fatter than I'm used to I
don't know if I'm gonna like this this
is like a pretty thick large angled
brush I usually like thin sharp ones but
we'll see and then there's this kind of
liner brush it looks more of like that
painting brush this is also pretty thick
I don't know how I'm gonna feel about
that
and then you get like one of these like
spoolie type of brushes I love brushes
like this I use them all the time he's
too concerned me but we'll see we'll see
because the next thing in the box I'm a
little bit worried about because every
time I drink coffee people who are
putting on eyeliner it never comes out
good but the next thing in the box is
honestly the cutest little freaking
eyeliner thing I've ever seen in my life
this is from the brand pretty vulgar
they sold this brand at Sephora I did
like a whole first impressions on this
brand like a months ago but this is the
ink gel eyeliner and it is called
blacklist but look how cute it's like an
old-school ink like back in the day
there's a little fun I'm obsessed this
is a full size product obviously listen
everything is pretty much full size
always inboxes turn I don't know why I
say that like don't know it's like habit
but this retails for $24 and we're gonna
try it out right now I thought it was
gonna be like inky cuz it's called the
ink gel liner but it's also called gel
eyeliner so I don't know why I thought
it was gonna be I'm gonna bring you in
closer we're gonna test out those
brushes and that liner but I'm nervous
okay so I'm gonna attempt to concentrate
looking into this mirror it's gonna be a
packed line I'm gonna try this one I
kind of feel like this eyeliner needs
duraline from Inglot or maybe I'm just
so used to the English eyeliner that's
like like liquidy and very very creamy
actually no no it's going on pretty
creamy this brush isn't as bad as I
thought so far I don't know what its
gonna look like when I attempt to do a
wing with this but we shall see okay but
stop talking to me guys I mean tit
concentrate
i squish it okay now I'm gonna do the
same thing on this eye with this brush
we're not gonna be able to see me do it
this eye and I can't put the table over
here because the table doesn't fit I'm
just gonna do it really quickly and then
I'll just lay no hago
do you guys have any idea what just
happened to me before I go into the
brush and I liner situation so I'm
looking at this boxy batch thing right
and I'm noticing that there are five
products here but I've only unboxed one
two three and then there's this is the
fourth but I see here that something
says pure sculptor palette I didn't know
this was sitting under here which is a
major bummer because sculptor palette
this is probably a face palette I
already put on bronzer and I had no idea
this was gonna be in the box I haven't
really been on social media much these
past couple weeks so I didn't even know
this was in the box
I am a mess so obviously I'm just gonna
open it up really quick right here oh
this is beautiful
well I mean for like eyeshadows for me
this would be like a really nice eye
shadow palette before I use that let me
tell you about the eye layer I think the
eye liner is good at first when I was
putting the brush in I was like oh this
is kind of dry but as I was applying it
it was really matte and really black and
I really liked it so the eye liner was
good the brushes surprised me I thought
I was going to hate them and I I didn't
hate them would I grab these before
other brushes and absolutely not I have
in my little anastacio angled brush that
I love fur gel eyeliner it's my favorite
it's the number 15 brush nothing beats
it but can you use this absolutely like
not bad not bad at all okay so now let's
check out this pure palette I'm gonna
try to highlight with originator even
though I already have highlight on let's
see this looks just a little bit
glittery but Wow it doesn't look
glittery on the face it just looks like
very metallic that's insane
okay so just because I'm gonna take
inventor cuz that one looks a little bit
lighter than founder I'm gonna take this
on a fluffy brush there is some kick up
but I never care about Coco as long as
they perform one on the eyes I do not
care I mean this is an eye shadow but
I'm just saying it's all like the same
thing isn't it
this actually applies really softly so
even though it looks really dark in the
pan it's actually coming off a little
bit lighter on the skin so maybe those
of you who think you can't contour with
this maybe you can I really like that
and now the last thing in the Box is
this guy this is a beauty creations
liquid lip gloss liquid lip gloss so is
it like glossy oh no wait it says matte
lip gloss Beauty creations matte liquid
lip gloss that's not a weird name at all
I think this is like a collab product
they did with boxycharm because Bacchus
terms name is almonds ooh this is a
really pretty color this one is called
kiss me kiss me oh my god I haven't
heard that song is so long that just
brought back so many memories
I don't know how I feel yet I'm gonna
wait for it to dry down completely
because it's a formula that dries very
very fast so right now it's like in a
very sticky state it's dry like but do
you see what this it's in a very sticky
stage at the moment so I'm gonna let it
like completely completely dry I have a
feeling this is gonna be a bitch to take
off this is gonna be one of those
formulas that first feels really sticky
it's gonna need like a whole five
minutes to dry but once it dries it's
like not going anywhere you know what I
mean
see like it's starting to get less
sticky but like I'm Emma I don't know
sick either yeah - sorry let's see okay
so it did come off a little bit here but
that's like inside of my mouth and
honestly it's not transferring this is
some heavy-duty shoes right here this is
heavy-duty dude heavy-duty dude that is
a full-size product and that retails for
ten dollars that's not even expensive
that's amazing that completes this video
guys those were all the products I got
in this month's bucks each arm okay so
I'm adding everything together Wow the
overall value this month was 174 dollars
I need to do my hair I look crazy 174
dollars that's expensive
okay and you only pay like 21 dollars
for the box which is awesome I'm gonna
have the box drum website down below
