again it's my monthly favorites video
and for some reason I remember saying in
my last favorites video that I feel like
I would have had a lot of things to talk
about this month because I have been
loving so many new things and then like
right before I started filming this I
sat down and I grabbed everything and I
put it right in front of me and I'm like
oh not really I don't know there wasn't
a whole lot that I fell in love with
this month there's definitely some
things that I tried out that were new to
me and that I loved them but nothing too
crazy I thought for some reason I was
gonna have a lot more to show you and I
don't have everything is not makeup this
month
usually it is like usually what I buy is
no makeup but this month I've got got a
variety of things to share with you okay
so the first thing I want to talk about
I've mentioned it a few times in some of
my previous videos but it is the L'Oreal
magic lumi night infusing primer I got
this in my drugstore haul last month and
I've completely fallen in love with it I
use this as a highlight not as a primer
and it has become my favorite highlight
of all time I kind of have tossed aside
my other highlights and I've just been
using this the entire month this is also
a very nice primer even though I use it
as a highlight but I really like how
this looks under matte foundations
because sometimes I feel like I don't
like to look too matte since I have dry
skin and when they put this under like a
matte foundation like this underneath
Revlon Colorstay looks really pretty it
just gives a nice radiant effects and
stuff
it is a nice primer but it is an amazing
liquid highlight I have it that's the
highlight I have
like on the bridge of my nose and on my
tops of my cheekbones and stuff uh-huh
okay the next thing I want to talk about
I got pretty recent but I was amazed by
it and it is the Loreal total repair 5
restoring shampoo and restoring
conditioner and have these little
travel-size and I've talked about the
damage erasing balm from the total
repair from the total repair 5 line that
they've got going on and the W racing
bump is one of my favorite hair masks
ever it's amazing so I tried these out
and oh my god this is this is a great
shampoo and conditioner the chef who
really cleaned my hair like really
really cleaned my hair but it didn't
like strip it didn't feel too dry it was
good and the conditioner leaves your
hair so incredibly soft like almost as
soft as the hair mask it's crazy and
these are really really cheap amazing
shampoo and conditioner I really
recommend them if you have damaged hair
yeah
repair is the five signs of damaged hair
like split ends Allah rebuilds fiber
strengthens yeah yeah you know all that
good stuff the next thing is a lipstick
that I've been so obsessed with lately
and it is wet and wild don't blink pink
and if you've seen any of my recent
videos I've been wearing this so much I
wore it in my in my last no I wore it in
my rainbow tag video I wore it in my
must have make a product video and that
says a lot because I have I have quite a
few lipsticks and I usually alternate
between them because I like to change it
up I love lipsticks so much and the fact
that I've been reaching for this so
often just shows what an amazing and
beautiful lipstick it is it's wet n
wilds don't blink pink and it is crazy
hot pink it's beautiful on the lips I
love it
love it love it it's $2 so I say that
because it's $2 crazy I know
okay the next product shock to me
because I used it years ago and I knew
that it was good but when I started
using it again recently I was like wow
this is really good and it's the
Neutrogena oil-free eye makeup remover
I'm sure you seen this a million times
it's old a lot of people swear by this
eye makeup remover and I understand why
I do I've been reaching for this over my
Burt's Bees I make it remover wipes that
I'm obsessed with that I love so much
because literally with one swipe all
your eye makeup is gone like all of it I
was kind of blown away I was using it
recently and I was like holy crap this
takes off all of my makeup all of my
makeup this I will continue to
repurchase this over and over and over
again this stuff is amazing I so
recommend it if you're having trouble
picking up you're taking off your eye
makeup especially with eyeliner it takes
off eyeliner really well and since it's
for your eyes it doesn't burn or sting
my eyes it just you know it's just it's
great it's just where it's great okay
I'm obsessed with maybelline color
whispers obsessed
I have parable and coral ambition these
are the only two I own I want to go get
olih lilac and milk abuse is the two
that I really want but this one is coral
ambition and keep in mind that they are
very bright in the tube but not bright
when you swatch them which I like that
because they're very very glossy oh my
god this color is beautiful I have like
the swatch from the other lipstick there
and this one is called petal rebel this
one is probably my favorite I like this
color
more but for some reason I've been
reaching for petal rebel more often and
it looks like a bright Barbie pink in
the tube here but when you put on your
lips it's like the prettiest little baby
pink oh I love it so much ignore this in
the middle that's when I swatch so what
am i lipstick and it's not coming off
this is coral ambition and this is petal
rebel right here and I've really been
loving to parent the petal rebel
lipstick on top of more pale nudes like
I love to pair it on top of my mac
lipstick and naturally eccentric this is
from the surf baby collection and you
see how like this is like the color of a
hand this is a very very pale nude and
this is one that's called a Pia viscous
it's a sheen supreme lipstick by Mac and
it's like a very white pink and I didn't
really use this one on that much until I
bought paddle rebel and I love layering
these two together or these two together
so these are amazing for layering on
their own they can be very sheer but you
can build them up they're just they're
so amazing I love these so much okay
really quickly I want to talk about the
rock daily resurfacing discs this is the
brand rock I just said that but this is
from the drugstore but it's pretty
pricey
that rock brand is like expensive that
Walgreens but it's expensive but I'm so
happy I picked these up they are daily
resurfacing discs they I'm like almost
out they look they they come in like
little pads like this one side is
completely smooth and the other side has
bumps on it for an exfoliator and these
things are amazing they're very soapy
like right now I have soap on my fingers
they're very soapy and it says
clinically shown to diminish the
appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
gentle enough for everyday use comes
with 28 of them and these are amazing
like amazing my skin feels baby soft
after I use them and the exfoliator side
is very very gentle but it does you know
deep clean and kind of get your like
flaky skin it comes right off but it's a
very soft exfoliator so I like that it
says in just one week the appearance of
fine lines is reduced and the skin tone
has in your skin tone has improved in
four weeks the signs of photoaging of
here diminished and in 12 weeks the
appearance of wrinkles and pores are
diminished I'm I'm bad so I didn't use
these every day
so it's kind of test them out I I don't
use these every day so I can't really
tell you that in 12 weeks my skin was so
much better because I didn't use them
consecutively to know that but they do
make my skin feel amazing right after I
use them so it is a little pricey but I
do think it's worth it the rock um
brand is amazing for skin care I love it
the next thing is a mascara which is
really really strange for me because I
swear by my clinic mascara but I have
been loving the illegal lengths mascara
by Maybelline from my bottom lashes
ferment bottom lashes only but this does
wonders for my bottom lashes it kind of
separates every lash and just makes them
so long and I really love mascara on my
bottom lashes I know a lot of people
don't but I love to have like long nice
bottom lashes I don't know if that's
weird but I love it and this mascara has
been doing a great job at just
separating them and giving them length I
love this for my bottom lashes okay
I have rediscovered my Anastasia brow
Wiz and I've had this forever it's like
in the old packaging as you can see now
it comes in like this really pretty
black and rose gold detailing I have
mine in like the old burgundy packaging
that's how long I have this and I used
it I bought it and I loved it and then I
kind of
put it at the bottom of my drawers and
it uses that much because I started to
use powder instead and I had kind of
gotten lighter like I started to go
lighter in my hair and this is like the
dark brown so I was like I didn't really
use it but for some reason lately since
my eyebrows have been out of control and
just all over the place
powder isn't looking good on them for
some strange reason I don't know so I
started using this again and I fell in
love with it I was like why did I stop
using this it's amazing
it can be a little harsh so you have to
have a very gentle hand with it I like
using it from like here on a little bit
stronger and then I get like a really
delicate hand towards the front of my
brows I don't know if that makes any
sense but and it's perfect because it
comes with a spoolie right here to brush
through your brows and then obviously
the little pen and it's retractable and
it's amazing and this is absolutely
perfect like this is basically all you
need and what I do is I brush through my
brows I paint them or you know fill them
in and then I brush to them again to get
rid of the harsh brush strokes that this
can sometimes leave when you pass the
spoolie through then one more time they
just look a lot more natural and I've
just been picking this up recently like
crazy okay so I have two more things to
show you that aren't Beauty related at
all but I use them for beauty related
things that makes sense and the first
one is coconut oil and I'm sure you guys
have seen this this is like the new rage
I don't know if it's the new rage but a
lot of people have been talking about
this and for a very good reason this
does wonders for your hair I got mine
off Amazon you have to make sure that
it's organic it's like the organic pure
extra virgin coconut oil what I do with
this is I am my spoon and this is solid
this isn't like an oil it's the solid
one and I take my spoon and I take like
three or four spoonfuls out and I'm
helped them for like a second because
this melts very quickly I run it through
my entire hair from root to tip and I
leave it on for about an hour sometimes
two hours doesn't matter I'll like eat
dinner or do something I don't know
they'll get in the shower and wash my
hair regularly and continue on with my
regular hair care routine that I have
and I feel like it really strengthens
your hair I know that it makes it soft
like everybody says it does it makes
your hair really soft and silky and
manageable and stuff but I feel like it
really strengthens your hair I don't
know if I'm the only one that sees that
when I use this because my hair just
feels very very strong after I use
coconut oil I don't know if that's weird
the next thing I want to show you I kind
of use it in conjunction with coconut
oil and also on its own and it is honey
this is a brand new one I just went
through an entire little bear um I would
recommend organic honey and I couldn't
find it anywhere I would have to
probably get it online but I couldn't
find organic honey I wouldn't a see I
don't know what that was about but I
couldn't find it but I like to add some
honey to the little hair mask coconut
oil thing I do because it gives moisture
back to your hair honey is very very
hydrating and I have dry hair so I love
using this for that because it just
hydrates my hair I don't know I wouldn't
use it if you've got oily very greasy
kind of hair I don't know I don't know
how that would work but I have frizzy
hair so that's good also I love using
this as a face mask um honey is very
safe to use on your face unless you're
like allergic to honey I wouldn't
recommend putting on your face but it's
a natural antibacterial and it hydrates
the crap on your face I like to mash it
up with like avocados or honey by itself
lately I've been trying to find very
natural things to put on my skin and on
my hair because certain things have kind
of been giving me like some weird
reaction
like some weird allergic reaction and
I'm trying to find organic alternatives
to things that I've been using but
anyway this the organic one would
probably be better but I'm mashing up
with avocados sometimes I put it all
over my face for about 15 minutes or
I'll put honey all over my face by
itself and I'll leave it on there for
like ten minutes ten fifteen minutes and
then when you wash it off your face
feels so hydrated and smooth it's crazy
like again I don't know how it would
work with people with oily skin probably
would work fine because my face doesn't
feel like moisturize or oily after I use
this it just feels feels like plump and
hydrated I don't know how to explain it
but I've been loving to use this on my
face in my hair on my ice cream I just I
just love honey okay guys so that's it
that's my Mei Mei why do I forget the
month every month
these were my main favorites um let me
know if you've tried any of these
products if you liked them and let me
know if you have anything that I should
try makeup related I mean hair care
related it doesn't matter anything that
you've been loving recently that you
think I should try let me know down
below and um yeah that's it please

like I would really really appreciate
that and I'll see you in my next video
