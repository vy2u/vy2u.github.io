my may favorites which means everyone
say it with me it is one month closer to
Danny the day is well the day I post
this will be June 2nd which means I see
Danny next month God willing and I can't
even I can't even and even though it's
getting closer and closer to the day I
see him I just miss him even more and
more every day so it's like bittersweet
it's just so I'm gonna kick it off with
a nail polish favorite and it is deep
nail polish that has been on my nails in
like the past million videos I have been
wearing it non-stop and it is by OPI
it's called life gave me lemons and this
nail polish came out with the new OPI
neons collection for summer and I only
picked up two of them this and the
purple one but this color is so amazing
my intentions were to paint my nails
this color and then the next week paint
them the purple color and that didn't
happen
I have painted my nails this color four
times in a row which doesn't happen to
me quite often I usually really get
bored with the nail polish that's all my
fingers and I change it up quite often
but not this one it's so pretty I
definitely recommend this color you do
need to use two coats with it though
because the first coat is just a little
bit sheer but with two coats it's
perfectly beautiful and it has just been
my go-to polish recently fun fact
Danny is super creeped out by neon nails
don't ask me why ok so I've been trying
to get in the swing of using falsies
more often I'm wearing them today I'm
using the ardell demi whispies right now
but I have been trying to use them more
often just because I really really suck
at applying lashes and that just kind of
turned me off to ever using them but I
think that they make eyes shadow looks
look so much better
they just make eyes look so much better
and
like man I really want to wear falsies
more often I never do
I don't like applying them it's a
mission and I suck at it so I have been
practicing a lot more trying to get into
the swing of wearing falsies more often
for my tutorials and stuff like that
which by the way I haven't been posting
that many tutorials lately because a
bunch of people were telling me that I
was posting too many and now people are
telling me that I don't post enough and
it's like oh I can't please everyone but
I like filming tutorials so I'm gonna
get back into filming a lot more
tutorials especially now for the
summertime I've got a lot of looks in
mind but comment down below which
tutorials you really want to see from me
I know you guys really wanted to see the
look I had in my olya unboxing and
that's coming up soon so don't worry
about that I will be filming that very
soon anyway back to what I was saying
I've been getting into wearing falsies
more often and I have found my Holy
Grail eyelash glue and it is the house
of lashes eyelash adhesive and this is
what it looks like
I ordered mine off of the House of
lashes website because I bought like a
three pack of House of lashes lashes
House of lashes lashes the other day and
my friend Shireen was like oh my god you
need to try the House of lashes glue
it's amazing
so Shireen if you're watching thank you
so much this stuff rocks I love it so
much I know everybody loves duo and I
agree it's really good but it smells
like fish Bart's in my opinion it's not
my pleasant scent I'm putting it on my
eyes and I'm like smells I don't like
that and this one does not smell bad on
the packaging it says it smells like
flowers I don't think it smells like
flowers but it definitely smells good
and not only is the scent good the
actual product is amazing it is one of
those that comes with the brush so all
you have to do is literally paint it on
your eyelash band and plop it right on
duo makes a hot mess for me whenever I
squeeze it onto the lashes like I'll put
way too much and it'll get everywhere
and then I'm sticky
hummus so the fact that this comes with
a little brush is amazing and also this
specific glue gets tacky really quickly
so I don't have to be like this for five
hours so I have been obsessed with this
glue I definitely recommend it it's
around the same price point as dual I
think I paid like eight dollars for it
but so well worth it my next favorite is
something I got in an empty bag and I
just quickly want to mention it because
it is so good it is the booboo cover-up
concealer I don't know what color this
is in it doesn't say it on the tube but
I think in the FC website it said it was
in the shade medium I'm not exactly sure
but this stuff is so good I have been
using it underneath my eyes and I mix it
with my Maybelline fit me concealer in
fair and this is a lot lighter so I just
mixed them together and I loved how it
looks underneath my eyes it's pretty
pigmented and it has pretty good
coverage so I really have been loving
this and the fit me concealer is have
been my obsession recently I have 15
fair and 10 light I will actually use
this as my foundation and then this one
underneath my eyes and just blend it all
out because I only need to use very
little since it is concealer it does
give me a good coverage on my face and I
don't feel like I have heavy makeup on
but I've been loving my fit me concealer
I think they are probably like one of
the best concealers at the drugstore and
I've also been loving my little booboo
cover-up
my next favorite has been something that
I have been using on my eyes a lot
recently and it is the Maybelline Color
tattoo in the color caramel cool this
stuff is so beautiful I posted it on
Instagram the other day and a lot of you
guys were like oh my god that's my
favorite one and I freaking agree out of
all the color tattoos I have this one is
like for some reason the most pigmented
the most creamiest the most beautifulest
and I don't know if this was limited
edition I'm pretty sure I'm not actually
I'm not sure but I got it not too long
ago and I've seen it a bunch of times at
my CVS and at my Walgreens it is like I
said caramel cool and it is this
beautiful copper but like a rosy copper
color
oh so gorgeous and in the Sun this makes
your eyes glow like I
use this by itself just all over my lid
and mascara and walk out the door and my
eyes just look nice and glowy and bronzy
it's so beautiful it is one of those
things that you don't need to put
eyeshadow on top for it to look
absolutely gorgeous and you only need
this like it looks like a dual chrome
like like if you have different colors
on your eyes and it is just this it is
so gorgeous so affordable and amazing it
is what I use to prime my eyes today I
used the original Naked palette on top
but this is what I used as a base and it
just means the eyeshadows look so
beautiful on top of it I love it they
don't crease they last all day the color
tattoos they're unbeatable dude they're
on people okay so because it is
officially summer I have been getting a
lot of color to my skin and I have been
self-tanning recently I don't know if
you can tell but I have been loving to
use tinted moisturizer as opposed to
foundation just like on a regular day to
day basis and the love of my life guys
love of my life is the bombs bomb
shelter tinted moisturizer wow this
stuff is heavenly I have mine in the
shade light/medium and it is what
matches me now in the summer when I have
a tan and of course this isn't what I'm
wearing on my face today the foundation
I'm wearing today is my Revlon Colorstay
in fresh beige because whenever I have
the opportunity to wear that foundation
I wear it because it is my perfect
summer color so that's why I'm wearing
on my face today but besides that this
is the best in turmoil Iser I have ever
used in my life I love it because it has
like medium coverage which is rare for a
tinted moisturizer and what I love most
about this is that it doesn't leave me
looking greasy you know how moisturizer
you put it on your face and you have
like that shine all over the place which
is normal for a moisturizer but for
something I want to use as foundation I
don't want that on my face and this
doesn't do that it almost looks like a
powder finish and it feels really nice
you don't feel it wet at all and even
though it's a tinted moisturizer I think
that this would work for people with
combo to oily skin because of the finish
it doesn't look greasy it's not like all
wet looking it's amazing I love this
tinted moisturizer holy grail status
right here it's a maid
my next favorite is what I love using to
apply this tinted moisturizer and it is
the makeup geek foundation stippling
brush this brush is so so good like
seriously big ol props to makeup geek
because their stuff is phenomenal but
this brush is heavenly
it's really similar to that Sigma flat
top kabuki brush that everybody loves
and raves about I'm free and I'm pretty
sure it's just as good I've washed it
and it didn't shed it's just a really
nice quality brush and I really love
using it with my tinted moisturizer
because I feel like this brush gives me
more coverage than my Beauty Blender
does so I love using it with that and it
just buffs it on so nice it doesn't
leave my face with any streak marks or
anything oh I've been obsessed with this
brush it is so good I recommend it to
everyone my next favorite is my holy
grail moisturizer I don't think I will
ever go back to any other nighttime
moisturizer ever again I mean you never
know I can't make any promises is the
origins high potency in vitamins mineral
enriched renewal cream this stuff is so
good I applied at nighttime obviously
and when I wake up in the morning my
face just looks so much smoother and
better I don't really suffer from acne
like pimples and stuff as I do from tiny
little white bumps that form underneath
my skin and they are just so frustrating
because they look terrible
underneath foundation it's just I hate
those little white bumps they drive me
nuts and whenever i exfoliate and then
use this on top and go to sleep in the
morning my bumps are a lot smaller I am
just so crazy about this and the scent
is amazing it smells like straight-up
orange zest if you don't like oranges
stay away from this because it's like
really intense orange smell and I love
that and it's just so good it's worth
every penny definitely check this out if
you're looking for a nice nighttime
moisturizer even if you have oily skin
because when I put this on it absorbs
quickly it doesn't feel gross I just I
really really love it and it has
improved my skin in my opinion
so it is so good a little bit so my last
three products are hair products I have
just been crazy about hair stuff
recently I don't know what it is I don't
know the first thing I want to talk
about has seriously I'm not even joking
changed my life okay it might not have
changed my life but it has definitely
changed the way I feel about my hair and
that is saying a lot you guys know I was
like bleached blond six months ago and
it damaged my hair so badly it was bad
and I've tried hair masks that have
worked really well I've done a treatment
on my hair that has worked really well
and a little by little my hair is kind
of like restoring itself but holy cow
this is the best hair mask in the
history of the world at least in my
opinion and it is the Carol's Daughter
at monoi repairing hair mask I have a
tiny little jar of this because it came
with a little set of the window a
shampoo and conditioner and I just
really wanted to try it out before I
went and bought the giant tub of this
because it is pretty pricey I want to
say it's like mmm thirty dollars or
thirty-six dollars it's pretty pricey
and I would honestly probably pay double
for this because it has made my hair so
silky so soft so manageable and it just
looks less damaged it is all thanks to
this I have only used it like about four
times and I still have half of this left
so I'm pretty sure the big tub will last
a really long time but the first time I
ever use this the next day I was
touching my hair and I was like why does
my hair feel so soft like softer than
usual why why and I didn't understand
why and then I realized it was this
anymore I used it the better my hair
felt this is probably the only mask that
right away the next day I'm like wow my
hair is so soft and honestly I've just
been so happy with this hair mask I am
definitely gonna run out and buy the
full size when I
so my hair is obsessed with argan oil it
literally eats that crap up all the time
I love putting argan oil on my hair I do
it every single day and I just ran out
of my HSI argan oil which is also really
good but I have been using the SKR
haircare argan oil I love the packaging
on this it is beautiful and it is large
and in charge I have never had an argan
oil this size this will probably last me
forever and I love that it has a pump
you just put it on your hands and put it
all over your hair I like to work this
on my tips or pretty much everywhere I
have really dry hair so I put it
absolutely everywhere and I actually
really love the scent of this one it
doesn't just smell like straight-up
argan oil it has a fragrance to it that
smells really pretty like a floral e but
like musky at the same time I don't know
the scent of this and I'm really bad at
describing scents but I just love how it
smells and it makes my hair smell so
great and it lasts a long time I just
have really been loving this and it's
actually pretty inexpensive when you
consider the size of this I think it's
about twenty-five dollars on the SK our
hair website so it's actually a really
good deal for such a large bottle of
argan oil so yeah definitely check this
out and make sure you don't drop it
because it's made out of glass that was
secretly a message to myself because I
drop absolutely everything and my last
favourite has been this Kendra shine
spray instant weightless shine I really
love shine sprays especially for my hair
because it is so incredibly dry that I
need some sort of shine at all times and
Kendra is just the brand that I have
been using on my hair for years and
years and years so I just gravitate
towards Kendra products and I just
really really love it just be careful
with any shine spray you use and make
sure you spray it very far away from
your hair because if you spray it up
close it will look like a giant patch of
grease this can make your hair and look
greasy
really fast so if you have naturally
greasy hair I would not recommend it if
you have dry hair then definitely this
will be your best friend
just remember spray it from far away
don't spray too much and you will get
instant shine to your hair I have it
right now on the tips of my hair I love
spring this
from about here down just to give my
tips some more shine and just make them
look like they're a lot healthier than
they really are so yeah I think that's
it I thought I had a little bit to share
with you guys but it turns out ahead
lots of this video is probably a lot
