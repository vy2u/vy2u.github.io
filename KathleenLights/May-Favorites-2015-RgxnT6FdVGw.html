my may favorites I feel like I always
sing that part may flavor I don't know
why or maybe I do and I just edit that
out look who just got here begging me to
get on my vanity Cornelius you guys
haven't seen Cornelius in a long time
because he's a grumpy old man who
doesn't like the other dogs that you
feel no you don't I like that about you
no new friends no no friends so without
further ado let's talk about all the
products I've been loving in the month
of May okay so first off I want to talk
about Zig low on my face see highlight
this is the highlight I have been
wearing non-stop I took it with me to
California and I just wear it the most
out of all the highlighters I own and
you guys saw my makeup school if you saw
my makeup stash video I recently posted
I briefly spoke about this this is the
Laura Mercier matte radiance baked
powder highlight in 0-1 this is what it
looks like and the best thing about this
besides the fact that is baked
I love baked powders is the fact that it
has no shimmer no glimmer no glitter
it's just it almost does kind of feel
like a matte powder but obviously it's
not and I love it I got it 40% off while
I was at I'm at so I scored a really
good deal on this cuz that's offensive
this is the NYX expensive highlight but
I promise you guys it's the one that I
get complimented on the most like my mom
whenever I wear this one she's like
encanta do glow and I'm like gracias
mami okay so this next product I've had
for a really long time but I just
recently started diving into it this is
the Maybelline Color tattoo and I love
the color tattoos but this one is the
best one this is bad to the bronze I did
a whole video on it like where I wear
this on my eyelids and this is the only
thing I have on my eyelids it's actually
what I have on my it's what I have on my
eyelids today like that is the only
thing on my lids besides my brow bone
highlight and my under for high but this
is it this is the most beautiful color I
have ever seen on a cream eyeshadow ever
high-end low-end it honestly is the
nicest if you don't have this you need
to get it because these last forever on
the skin and they're creamy and they're
amazing a lot of people told me and my
get ready with me video where I use this
like why didn't you show will you used
in your crease because you clearly have
a different color in your crease but no
I didn't I had this only the great thing
about this is that you can use a brush
like a fluffy brush and lightly put it
in your crease and the and the shimmer
doesn't show up so it looks like a nice
light brown in the crease and then you
get a more dense brush and you pack it
on your entire lid and it looks like a
completely different color like the more
you pack this on the more foiled and
metallic it looks so today I didn't
really pack it on that much and you can
see it's just like a nice topi bronze
wash of color but if you want to get
really intense with it you can pack it
on and it looks like you're ready for
the town
I love this okay so a bronzer I forgot
to mention in my bronzer video because I
keep it with my blushes it's like
labeled a bronzer / blush this is the
bombs
um blush / bronzer I love this so much
because it reminds me a lot of Mac's
harmony blush which is probably my most
repurchased blush from Mac because I use
it as a contour as a bronzer as a blush
it's a brown with like a pinky undertone
which this one is as well I have this on
my cheekbones today it's a really nice
formula um and I feel like it lasts a
long time on my skin oh yeah long wear
for an endless summer oh yeah see by the
way if you guys are wondering hey
worries where is it I have on the new
covergirl outlast stay luminous natural
glow foundation on my face right now and
so far so good I really like it but I'm
gonna review it on my channel so they
make a comment down below if you do want
me to review it it's pretty new and I
was on the hunt for it and I finally
found it so okay so this next favorite
is so random so random this is the I
keep looking out the window because
there are people like walking in front
of my window and it's so awkward this is
the elf makeup remover pen elf is just a
couple of dollars um and this is so
strange this stuff is so good for effort
upper like me and my
a little the tip is dirty because I've
used it so much but I just like wipe it
on my hand
and it stays stained but the dirtiness
like doesn't transfer but what I like to
use this for is whenever this happens to
me more often than not I know that it
happens to a lot of you too because we
know we're all human right whenever I'm
putting on my mascara and I'm like going
to town putting on mascara vigorously
and then you get like little mascara
dots or you just get mascara all over
your eyelid this sucker works for that
it's kind of like an eraser for it so
let's say I get mascara all over my
eyelid or like three dots of mascara I
wait till it completely dries and then
I'll just get this little pen that's
like a little white tip and I just dot
it on the mascara and it races it
without really disturbing without really
disturbing my eyeshadow underneath it's
like the craziest thing the cutest
little invention and it works it's like
a little eraser for mascara mess ups and
it's a couple of dollars and I highly
recommend this next product is expensive
well this is the smaller version so this
is the hourglass number 28 primer serum
I have the tiny little bottle this is
$22 for this tiny stupid bottle the
full-size primer is $65 okay let that
sink in for a second I'm like dying to
try the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation and I won't because it's $65
so I would not specify those on a primer
Wow is it good I think that I'm just
going to continue to repurchase the $22
one even though it's little because a
little go such a long way with this
product that I feel like I can make it
last a long time hourglass I feel like
is really known for their for their
mineral veil primer that everybody raves
about and that one's good that one's
really good but for super super super
dry skin it doesn't work the best now
this is no joke I almost don't want to
use it during the summer time because
during the summer my skin isn't as dry
as
you're you're making me dizzy like in
the winter even in Florida which is not
even a winter even in Florida my skin
like flakes off it comes off in little
chunky little flakes and get that dry I
know it's super disgusting but my skin
gets that dry and I feel like this was
everything I needed in the winter I I
still use it now because my skin is so
dry but guys this is an oil this is like
an oil serum a little goes such a long
way and you just apply it to your entire
face and instantly you have like super
oily skin it's amazing not oily skin but
it's like an oily serum that I don't
know it's amazing I only recommend this
for people with super dry skin not even
just a little dry like very dry skin if
you find that Foundation's just look so
cakey and gross on you because your skin
is so dry I've been there I've had that
problem
this guy will work for you I even
purchased this which I never thought I
would this is the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte I would never buy matte
foundations but using this primer I can
use matte fine fine day teens and it
still it looks nice the best discovery I
think I've ever had is the NYX micro
brow pencil the best discovery in the
sense that I didn't think anything could
be my Anastasia brow Wiz and it didn't
beat it but it's just as good and that's
crazy crazy I have tried so many brow
products from the drugstore so many and
I'm sorry but nothing compared to my
Anastasio brow Wiz they she's just when
it comes to brow products and that is
the best I have been using that product
on my eyebrows for years since before
YouTube this is just as good the
packaging is very similar it has the
spoolie on one side and then the product
on the other I use brunette in the
Anastasio one which is now called the
dark brown and I use brunette in my NYX
micro brow pencil it's what I have in my
eyebrows today I use this next one it's
just as good and it's like half the
price I'm so impressed nixed it's such a
good good job on this brow product I
love it okay so really quickly I'm going
talk about brushes this is the Real
Techniques sculpting brush this is like
a newer brush to Real Techniques I
purchased mine at Ulta and it's like a
contour brush like an angled kabuki
brush right I'm talking about it because
instantly I fell in love with it the
second I used it it's multifunctional I
used it today to put on my foundation so
I used it with this covergirl one and it
just blends the product really nicely it
doesn't leave streak marks I love it
just as much as my buffing brush like I
love this one for foundation and this
one doesn't leave any street marks I
have the expert face brush and I swear
it leaves streak marks it's really
strange I know people swear by it but
this blends the foundation really really
nicely into the skin and it just gets
right up in your areas like right up in
here right up in here and because it's
so skinny like it's angled and it's
skinny it gets right in between my
eyebrows perfectly and I'm the type of
person that puts my eyebrows on first so
I really love that I can get right up in
there it's just a really comfortable
brush and I used it today to like bronze
up my skin with this um I just got this
my friend serene here on YouTube serene
woo she sent this to me when she was in
the UK and I'm in love with it already
but I just got it so I didn't wanna
mention it but I used the bourgeois
bronzing primer it's like a Soleil
bronzer very similar to Chanel and I
just dipped it in there and I kind of
used it to bronze up my skin a little
bit and then I used it to contour with
my powder it's just a really great brush
and I think you guys should check it out
okay so different brushes I quickly want
to talk about these two bad boys right
here if you follow me on Instagram you
know that I got the whole morphe brushes
elite collection now I'm really really
sad to find out that this is a limited
edition collection I don't know why
these brushes are limited edition to be
100% with you because these are the best
brushes morphe has ever come out with
and they feel top-notch like this feels
like a cosmetics and you know it
cosmetics
really pricey now these are pricier
brushes on morphe they have brushes that
are a lot cheaper than this these feel
like Chanel make these or something like
lyocell brushes and I really have been
loving these two I've been loving them
all but I really love the e 2 and I use
this as a powder brush like I dip it
into like my powder foundation and I
just like buff it around cuz it's pretty
dense and it's so fluffy it feels nice
on the face and then oh no I was loving
another brush too where is it
got it but anyway so this is a great
powder brush and then this one I really
love it for blush for cream because the
thing about these is these aren't vegan
and they're really great for cream and
powder products which is great so I like
it with cream blush like this is amazing
and then this brush I think is the best
out of the entire collection like if you
are only going to buy one because these
are pricey
I recommend the morphe 3 this is a nice
contouring brush powder brush blush
brush it's an all-around fabulous brush
it's definitely my favorite so I really
love the morphe elite collection its
pricey but the quality like just buy one
because it maybe you guys don't believe
me but just buy one and when you get an
American but it all feels right
I just became a morphe affiliate and I
always tell you guys when I'm an
affiliate um so if you don't want to use
the code you don't have to but I mean it
gives you 10% off but I totally
understand you don't want to just go to
morphe brushes calm and check out the
brushes cuz they these are really good I
mean they have really great other
brushes the flawless collection is nice
too but those I'm gonna beg them to make
it permanent I'm gonna beg ok so now I'm
going to talk about hair products I
purchased this on Sephora calm this is
the tangle teezer and I have heard so
many people talking about this and I
always thought ok cool it's a little
brush that looks like it's made for
Polly Pocket like
for my little cousin or something but no
no I will never ever ever ever ever ever
brush my hair with another product ever
again this breaks my hair a lot less
than any other brush that I've used I
mean my hair is very damaged from
bleaching it in the past but whenever I
use any brush a comb anything it was
just like fulla hair this one does not
break my hair like that and what's great
is that this works really well um when
your hair is wet like to detangle it
when your hair is wet when your hair is
dry this stuff detangle my hair
instantly and this guy has been my
Savior it's been my best friend
it gets the nuts out really fast and you
can get tangled tangled teasers anywhere
but I like the ones sold at Sephora
because they have like a like a cap to
where you don't put like your brush like
on stuff so I really love this next hair
product is from lush and I don't really
talk about lush because I don't have a
lush near me recently when I was at the
mall I saw that there was a lush and I
was like I'm gonna go in there and my
friend Stephanie was telling me that she
had heard really good things about the
RnB hair moisturizer that it's great for
people with curly hair this says it's a
rich leave-in moisturizer to revive and
balance drier curly hair with beautiful
butters and oils and this works really
really well on my hair and actually me
and Stephanie both bought it at the same
time and Stephanie hated it but feminie
has more of a wavy hair so I would only
recommend this for someone who has very
very frizzy a very very fine hair but
it's still like frizzy so it works for
me if you have thick coarse super super
dry curly hair and you just can't manage
to keep your curls nice and bouncy I
would highly recommend this a little
goes a very very long way and I just
scoop some out of the pot it's like this
cool yellow color I'm not a fan of the
scent I just scoop it out of the pot
it's not like overpowering but and then
I put it in between my fingers and I
warm up the product a lot like I get it
a little bit watery with the warmth of
my hands cuz it's pretty sick and then I
just run it on my curly hair when it's
wet don't put this one it's dry and then
when my hair dries my hair
just like bouncier and curlier but like
nice and last product I want to talk
about today is inspired by Jacqueline
Hill because I had never tried this this
is the loving tan 2 hour Express deluxe
bronzing mousse in dark now you guys
know I love loving tan but I use the
ultra dark mousse and it's like the
regular one it's not the 2 hour Express
I always put on the mousse and then just
go to sleep because it takes about like
7 to 8 hours to develop so I just let it
develop while I'm asleep but sometimes
people don't like to sleep in
self-tanner which I don't care but I
understand that feeling um I used this
in California when I was when I had to
go somewhere like five hours prior and I
put this on and in two hours you are
dark so I took a shower applied this and
then two hours later took a shower again
to wash off the excess tan and your dark
and beautiful and amazing and it just
takes two hours and that's crazy so if
you're someone who doesn't like to sleep
in your tan or don't like to or don't
like to wait 50,000 hours to let it
develop then I highly recommend this
it's good stuff okay so those are my
favorite products of the month these
videos are always really long because I
just get chatty and rambling and I hope
