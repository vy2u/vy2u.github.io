my main favorites these are products
I've been loving in the month of May I'm
still sick I've actually feel like I'm
coughing more than ever today still
don't have my voice back 100% but the
show must go on I actually don't have a
lot of makeup products to talk about
today like actual makeup because I just
haven't been wearing makeup that much
this month so I was only playing around
with makeup a little bit but don't worry
this video will still be 80 years long I
do have other stuff that's a little bit
more random to share with you today so
let's just get started
so I have been loving the bare minerals
bare skin sheer Sun serum bronzer this
is a liquid bronzer and it has kind of
like a serum eat consistency you have to
shake it up before you use it and I like
to just apply this to the back of my
hand and then grab a brush and kind of
buff it into my skin I don't like to use
a Beauty Blender with it because I find
that it soaks up a lot of the product
with this guy for some reason so I
prefer using like a buffing brush and
I'm wearing it today but I do have a
powder bronzer on top and I love this
because it doesn't make my skin look
orange so many liquid bronzers like the
benefit do the hula so it's called I
think I'm not sure it's a liquid bronzer
and it just looks too warm on my skin
this is a warm bronzer but it makes your
skin look tan like you've just been
sunkissed
it's beautiful and I've been loving this
I have to talk about this shameless plug
I know I'm sorry but the colour-pop
lippie stick in Aquarius it's what I've
been wearing all month I think I've
fallen in love with Aquarius more this
month than any other month like even
when it released I've been wearing it
non-stop I wore it pretty much
throughout Vegas during the day even at
night this is just like all I have been
wearing
it's what I'm wearing on my lips right
now obviously to me it's the perfect
nude when I don't know what lip color I
want to wear I always just reach for
Aquarius it's definitely my favorite
product I've ever created with color pop
I think I know that seems crazy but
actually there's some things that I'm
working on with color pop at the moment
that won't release for a while but
Aquarius has been holding it down for me
I also really really want to talk about
the NARS lip covers these came out for
like a summer 2016
I do get PR from NARS
but I didn't get any of their like
summer collection at least not yet so
maybe I purchased these and I'm gonna
get sent them I don't know but I bought
these three on my own because I
originally bought overheated and then I
fell in love with the formula that I
bought the other two it's pretty much
like a literal liquid lipstick it
doesn't dry super matte it's kind of
just like a lipstick liquefied if that
makes any sense I was wearing overheated
in my Ipsy bag unboxing this month it's
just like a really pretty Molly rosy
Brown the formula on these I can't
describe how good they are they actually
reminds me a lot of the colour-pop ultra
satin lips so I think the colour-pop
ones are definitely a dupe for these the
colour-pop ones are way more affordable
but if you cannot get colour-pop where
you are and maybe you can get NARS try
the lip covers they're so comfortable
they kind of have like a satin finish on
the lips I was wearing get dirty the
other day I'll post a picture and I just
I love how they make my lips look
because they just glide over the lips
they don't cling on to any dryness they
are honestly amazing amazing lip
products I need to take it back to an
oldie but a goodie this is the elf baked
blush in the shade pink tastic it's
obviously not a blush it's a highlight
don't know why it was labeled blush it's
the highlight I'm wearing on my cheeks
right now I used it in a recent tutorial
I also have this in my inner corners
underneath my brow bone pretty much put
it all over my face on my nose guys I
love this so much this is my favorite
highlighting product by elf it's only
like three dollars and it's incredible I
kind of stay away from the pinky section
I love the champagne tone so beautiful
if I didn't tell you I was wearing a an
elf highlight you probably wouldn't tell
because it feels high-end like it looks
high-end but ever since I posted about
this a couple of people have been
telling you that it's discontinued I
promise you I will be so upset with elf
if they discontinued this let me see if
you can still find this on the website
ok it's still on the website under their
baked blushes but it's sold out like
it's out of stock oh my gosh I hope you
are discontinuing this I'll be so st.
hopefully you guys can still find this
if you find it grab it because it's
beautiful
I love it I love it so much please we
don't lose contain units okay so those
were all the makeup products I've been
using this month the rest are kind of
more read to me still beauty related but
a little bit random I have been wearing
my shadow foundation a ton this month
it's pretty much the only foundation I'm
wearing
besides my Laura Mercier candle glow
foundation I've been loving that one too
actually mixed both of them today to
apply to my fights but anyway this is a
Valentino perfume and this one is called
Donna I bought this at Nordstrom
specifically to take with me to Vegas if
you guys have seen my snapchats and my
Instagram you already know but I want to
do this thing where every time I travel
to a place I've never been before I want
to buy a perfume specifically for that
vacation and only wear that perfume on
that vacation so that I don't know
months later I can smell that perfume
and think back on that vacation because
you guys know like scents just trigger
memories and there are so many perfumes
I have in my collection that whenever I
put it on it just takes me back to like
a certain time when I really wore that
perfume it's incredible I love that
about perfume it's my favorite thing
about perfumes honestly so I picked up
Valentino Dona to take to Vegas and even
though I've only been back from Vegas
for a little while this already heard
mines me of Vegas oh my gosh I used like
half the bottle on the trip really I
don't know was I that turn in Vegas that
I didn't notice that I was just like
wasting this perfume but I was showering
in this perfume and I cannot tell you
how many times someone asked me like
what perfume are you wearing there was
even a girl who worked at the casino
that like chased me down the casino and
I didn't even notice she was like hey I
need to know what perfume are you
wearing I was like Valentino gone up it
smells really beautiful the other day
Melissa came into my room and she
smelled it and she's like oh my god this
reminds me of the hotel room I guess
because I sprayed it so much just like
the room started to smell like this if
you are interested in the notes I pulled
them up on my phone the notes are
bergamot iris patchouli I love patchouli
vanilla and a Bulgarian rose I would say
there is a mix of like floral and
vanilla mixed together actually have
been wearing it recently like in the
past few days because I want it to
really remind me of aliens my next
favorite is actually something I didn't
think I would like these are the simple
sensitive skin experts my seller makeup
remover wipes I'm pretty sure these are
new I tried out this simple micellar
water like the actual micellar water and
I didn't like it it burned my eyes
really badly so I was totally hesitant
to try these but I was just walking
around Walgreens and I was like you know
what I'm gonna try them and I love them
I like these so much more than the
actual micellar water these my seller
wipes take off all my makeup in such a
gentle way I even prefer these to their
regular simple wipes that I've used for
years they just take off all my makeup
and they do not burn my eyes and I'm
talking about like I rub my eyes they
don't burn my eyes I was so surprised
since the other one did totally
recommend these they're very good for
sensitive skin I have sensitive skin and
it hasn't given me like any irritation
and it kind of hydrates your skin as
well you know how some makeup wipes Oh
take a fire your makeup and your face
will kind of feel a little bit tight you
don't get that with these I really truly
love these all right so my next favorite
is probably my ultimate favorite of the
month like ultimate most of you know
some of you don't I'll just tell you the
story really quick I was smelling a
candle and it's really hard to explain
let me kind of demonstrate it was a Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works candle and I was smelling
the candle but I don't even want to get
too close and I got too close I was
outside and I got too close and I
honestly don't know how but I feel like
it was the heat of the flame something I
got really close I don't know what I was
doing I was like in the middle of a
conversation I don't know but I burned
off my lashes on my left eye I felt them
like crisp up and fall on my cheek like
it's that serious it didn't burn off all
of them I would say it burned off like
half of them I had pretty long lashes to
begin with and these were actually my
good lashes I had really nice lashes on
his eye and it kind of burned off like
half of them and when I first tried to
put my Skara after that happened you
could not see my lashes at all they were
just like really really hard really
crispy and just short and stubby like I
had to wear individual lashes or like
falsies for a good two weeks there but
this has
been helping my lashes tremendously this
is castor oil
I actually was recommended this by so
many of you on Twitter
I have been putting castor oil on my
lashes every single night before I go to
sleep and I've seen a world of a
difference within a month I'm gonna see
if I could zoom you in they don't look
like much now because they're very short
because I mean I burned them off but
compared to how they were like mascara
didn't even make them look decent at all
they were just sticking straight out and
so burnt I feel like this has made a
world of a difference guys like you have
no idea how crispy they were and like
how short they were I mean they're still
short compared to how my lashes were
naturally they were pretty long but wow
I am so impressed it's been doing a
great job and I'm going to continue to
use it just so that they can get longer
and stronger this is a hundred percent
pure organic castor oil moisturizing oil
for hair and skin I haven't tried this
on my hair because it doesn't very have
some oil like dripping on the side it is
a very thick oil not sure how I would
use this on my hair but you could
totally use this on your eyebrows as
well to maybe make them thicker I
haven't tried that yet maybe I will I
bought mine on Amazon honestly I would
have picked any brand this is just like
the first one that popped up because I
searched 100% pure organic castor oil
this is the one I found so thank you so
much castor oil I love you okay so my
next favorite I briefly spoke about in
my cat chats video but I wanted to talk
about in a game I have been addicted to
matcha powder addicted when I was in
Vegas me and Jesse would go to like
Starbucks pretty much every morning and
I would get like my usual coffee and I
noticed she was getting this like big
venti thing of just like green liquid
and I'm like what are you drinking she's
like oh it's just regular venti iced
water but with matcha powder in it I was
like was much about her tell me about it
and basically this is just like
concentrated green tea it's green tea in
powder form and I despise not even just
like I despise green tea I've never
liked the flavor of it surprisingly
matcha powder is delicious I don't know
I could definitely taste its green tea
but it isn't I don't know I like it I
actually like it Jesse let me try it and
I was like oh my god I don't hate it I
kind of like it
and then I've been at
- ever since I don't like to order from
Starbucks anymore because I recently
found out that they had sugar in theirs
like when you order matcha powder at
Starbucks they don't tell you but
their's has sugar in it which is not
cool Starbucks at least let a girl know
so I got it off of Amazon you know where
I get everything and I bought matcha
powder this is organic matcha and the
only ingredient in here is organic
matcha it says it helps your metabolism
increase focus your skin health and it
gives you energy which is why I started
to drink it it gives me so much energy
like way more energy than coffee and so
much better because I feel like when I
drink coffee I get a lot of energy then
it goes away and I just feel kind of
like sluggish with this I don't feel
that way I just have energy I mean I
have Cuban coffee every once in a while
with like the family like Cubans just
get together they drink Cuban coffee
that's what we do
but in the mornings I just fill my cup
up with water ice and I take just a
couple of scoops of matcha powder and I
drink this and I just get so much energy
I love it a lot of people were asking me
about this cup this is just a cup my
friend Stephanie bought me when she went
to Disney if you're someone who you're
like you know what I don't want to do
the coffee thing it gives me the jitters
it gives me anxiety don't drink coffee
try matcha powder it looks like these
take a screenshot okay I have one more
favorite to share with you guys this is
from a brand called secret and it is
their ocean Mist salt and oil scrub this
is the ocean Mist they have like a honey
one that I actually want to try after
this one I will purchase it when I'm
done with this I love this I used to
hate salt scrubs like with a passion
guys with a passion they just always
dried out I have an itch they just
always dried out my skin but this one
from secret has oil mixed in it so it
really moisturizes my skin but I guess
the salt and it just exfoliates my body
so well like even better than other
exfoliators I've tried in the past
secret is kind of like a brand where
it's pricey unless you buy through
someone who represents secret like a
representative for secret I don't know
if I'm making any sense but I feel like
I keep mentioning Jesse in this video
like a creep but my friend Jesse
Jesse smiles as you know she's a
youtuber her mom is a representative for
secret and me and her got together about
a month ago and she was showing me all
of the products from secret like she
gave me a facial we were just hanging
out I love Jesse's mother like if she
was my own mother she tried this out on
my body for like the first time she put
it all over my arms and I was like
rubbing it in and I was immediately
shocked by how smooth my skin was and
how great it exfoliated my body if
you've never expose eiated your body
honestly it's amazing especially for dry
skin because it just takes up all the
dead skin and when she first pulled this
out I was like oh girl I don't like salt
scrubs
she's like try it fantastic it has a
very strange consistency because when
you pick it up with your hands or like
with a spatula it has like the oiliness
to it but salty at the same time and I
like this scent the ocean mist because I
feel like I'm at the beach I told
Jesse's mom I was like listen I love
this so much I totally want to tell my
subscribers all about it I bought like
three other things besides this you save
a lot more money when you buy kind of
like their bundle deal they have a
bundle deal thing and that's what I did
to save money I purchased all these
products by the way I bought this I
bought like on two other masks and some
exfoliator for my face
and I've just been loving this brand but
when I told her I was like listen I want
to tell my subscribers about it but if
they do want to buy this I want them to
get like the best deal I want them to
get like a bundle and I want them to go
through you because I mean I went
through you and I just I love her so
much she's like I you know how you meet
certain people and you just know like
you're good people I love you so much
that's I feel about Jessie and her mom
like so if you guys are interested in
getting this I'm gonna link it below she
has a website I'm gonna link it below
watch the video and she has like the
whole deal where you can get a bundle or
you totally can buy this on its own all
the information will be on that website
this video is not sponsored she's
literally just my friend and I truly
love this I haven't been using it every
day obviously but every time I go to tan
my body I've used it go to her website
