my may favorites we're going to be
talking about all the products I was
loving in the month of May and I'm going
to give you my thoughts on them and you
guys know you guys see these videos you
guys know these videos are many in years
long so let's hop to it okay so as you
roll into the warmer months especially
here in Miami I don't like to go to full
coverage with my foundation and most of
the time I rarely wear foundation in the
summer and thus I'm filming a video and
do my makeup tutorial stuff like that
but on the daily like on the regular I
like to go with something a little bit
more lightweight and recently I have
just been loving the tart tart guard
tinted moisturizer this is such a nice
gentle moisturizer for all skin types I
feel the formula and the texture is
really nice it's not too greasy it's not
too wet feeling it almost has the
consistency of a regular foundation but
it does feel a little bit more
lightweight it's not as heavy and it
just blends right into the skin almost
immediately and it feels like your skin
drinks a glass of water it doesn't look
cakey or dry it looks naturally radiant
it's not overly dewy you know it's like
that perfect in-between tinted
moisturizer I love it and I find it has
pretty good coverage considering it's
just a tinted moisturizer it's what I
have on my skin right now obviously I
put a full face of makeup on and
typically I will use this for like no
makeup makeup days but I think it works
both ways for an everyday quick look
they're just going to throw something on
or for like a full face of makeup the
coverage is there and it has SPF 20 I
wish have a little bit more SPF but it
has SPF 20 which is nice I have just
really been enjoying it I used to wear
the shade light and now I wear
light/medium now that I'm a little bit
more tan I don't think the shade
selection is very good that's the only
con I will say I don't think there are
many colors in the range but I like that
it has a physical SPF and I love the
coverage and I love the feel on my skin
so I had to mention it because I have
been using this non-stop this month I
want to give a quick little shout out to
this palette this is the morphe 35o
palette and i know you guys are tired of
seeing this palette honestly it's just
it's so good you guys know me I'm not
one to really push my cold I do have a
morphe coat but I rarely ever talk about
it because it's always in the
description box and I never feel the
need to tell you because it's always in
the description box and I know that
people are constantly pushing more fiood
it's like the brand
all over YouTube but honestly some of
their stuff is really really good and
especially considering the price to me
morphe is one of those brands that's
perfect for someone in high school
someone who's on a budget or even
someone who just doesn't like spending
money on makeup you get a lot of bang
for your buck and this is one of those
palettes that I feel is really really
really worth it you have all of these
amazing rich brown shades right here
that are all matte I do think some of
these are very similar I wish they would
have had like one or two more crease
shades I mean these are all crease
shades but a little bit lighter but
besides that I think it's brilliant you
have your matte shades right here and
then you have all your delicious olive
tone bronze shades right here I love the
undertone in these and I've only used
three of them I've used this color this
color and this one up here
I mainly use the matte side I'm just
been using this palette like all the
time I've been using it in conjunction
with other palettes but I keep this one
on my desk and for some reason I always
grab for it I'm actually wearing this
color right here on my entire lid and
that is the only thing I have on my eyes
right now on my lid and on my lower lash
line and I also have this one
highlighting the brow bone oh I'm lying
I also have this color really really
close to my lashes and that has been
like my go-to look every single day I'll
just take one of these shades buff it
into my crease and put it on my entire
lid kind of like a wash of color like an
all matte look and then that's what I've
been rocking recently and on these
warmer months I really can't be bothered
with like a full-blown smoky eye okay so
my next thing is bronzer and the reason
why I love it so much is a little bit
random this is the LC bronzer and I have
the shade light this was sent to me
think she came out with like four or
five bronzers and of course light is the
one that works for me
first of all I love this packaging I
love Elsie's branding it's so simple and
sleek I love all her products like
packaging lines I think it's really nice
so how this bronzer has like a really
strong magnetic closure I just really
like the packaging but the bronzer is
actually extremely extremely pigmented
it has one of those formulas that when
you put your brush into the compact you
get a lot of powder pick up because the
formula is so soft but it's really
really easy to blend out all you have to
do is tap the brush a couple of times
and you get a really beautiful flawless
bronzer application and I really like
the fact that it is so soft and so
pigmented just make sure to tap that
and the reason why I love it even more
than I normally would is because this is
my favorite bronzer when I'm not wearing
any foundation I don't know if any of
you out there can agree with me but has
it ever happened to you where you know
there are days you just you don't want
to put on foundation but you still kind
of want to do everything else so I'll
put a little bit of concealer my
moisturizer a little mascara little brow
pencil you know the bare minimum but
yeah I feel like I need some color in my
face and I will always put on bronzer
and unless you know foundation
underneath sometimes bronzer can look a
little patchy a little unblended and at
the same time kind of a little faded
well I don't find this to be the case
with this bronzer I feel like this is
the only bronzer in my collection I
don't know if it's because it is so soft
and pigmented but this really shows up
on my skin even when I'm not wearing any
foundation and it still looks really
smooth on the face this bronzer really
packs a punch I really love it whenever
I'm like acid a is not a foundation day
this is a bronzer I grab it lasts all
day I love the undertone in this cuz
it's not too warm but it's not too ashy
I just can't put it down I love it
speaking of bronzer I want to share with
you guys this magic little brush because
I've been using this a lot to contour
with not really to run the skin but I've
been using this to contour this is the
Mac one 40s brush and I'm always the
first person to tell everyone that they
don't need Mac brushes Mac versus are so
overpriced for what they are and you can
get versions like that pretty much
anywhere but this shape to me is so
unique I can't seem to find anything
like this in my collection or anywhere
online I was trying to search for a dupe
and I couldn't really find it this is a
brand new brush to Mac's and this was
actually sent to me it's like a giant
fan brush but a lot thicker and a lot
more dense but yet not too dense where
you feel like all it's doing is like
taking off your makeup you know I was
running around sometimes bronzer brushes
they're too dense
they really don't work for me this is
like the perfect amount of density
because it's still really soft
yeah it's precise enough where it really
applies the bronzer perfectly to give
you a nice chiseled effect it just fits
so perfectly in the hollows of my cheek
bones it's not too skinny but it's not
too feisty it's perfect I love this if
any of you out there can think of a dupe
for me I would greatly appreciate it I
do have brushes that look like this that
look like this at first glance but they
don't feel the same but I'm open to try
any suggestions you
down below so definitely let me know
tell me why it's taken me so long to
completely fall in love with this
concealer this is the Milani retouching
erase like lifting concealer and I'm in
the shade fair sometimes I use a shade
light depending how thin I am but I'm
usually fair I feel like more people
haven't talked about this concealer
because the damn applicator is so weird
and so annoying like it has this weird
little sponge at the tip and it kind of
fiddles you off I'm not going to lie
because you have to squeeze this and it
gets kind of messy and kind of weird and
then you can't apply it as perfect as
you want it to because you have to get
the right amount out of this weed its
emission it really is I wish I had a
completely different applicator and I
feel like that's the reason people don't
really kiss this a fair shot because
when I first bought it I used it all the
time and then I kind of just forgot
about it when I pulled it back out again
and I cannot stop using this I really
agree with the name of this concealer
because when you put it on it does feel
like it's a light lifting concealer like
it brings so much light to your under
eyes yeah it covers up your dark circles
the coverage is really good I wouldn't
say it's extreme coverage like the Tarte
shaped tape it has a little bit more of
a natural coverage but it still covers
up my dark circles it's very thin and
liquidy so it's really easy to blend it
just looks like your skin is really
fresh and youthful
I wish Milani would come out with like a
light lifting foundation with a similar
formula and vibe because that would look
beautiful I love putting this in between
my brows on my chin like pretty much in
my t-zone I love applying this concealer
because it just highlights the face so
nicely I swear I'm like obsessed with
this so ever since I got this product
back in a boxycharm I cannot stop using
it this is the Oprah highlighter and
Rodeo Drive when I first got this
product I didn't really use it all that
much because it is a pretty strong
golden highlight it's not two goals but
it is a gold is gold so I found I was
only able to use this when I had a
little bit of a tan and I don't know
what happened to it I'm pretty sure I
gave it away
but then when I got it back in a boxy
charm when I put it on my face I was
like oh my gosh
why did I give you away this is the kind
of highlight I wear when I need a
popping highlight like a blinding
intense highlight it's the highlight I'm
wearing on my face right now and I
didn't even put that much this is a very
ultra metallic wet looking highlight
it's going to be very intense it's not
for the faint of heart it's not subtle
not even a little bit so this is perfect
for you if you are looking for that I
call this a nighttime highlighter I'm
wearing it now so you guys can see it
but I would typically only wear this at
night because it just looks crazy at
night it looks so beautiful and blinding
like in the light at night in photos at
parties wherever you're going dinner I
don't know this looks incredible and I I
can't stop you so pretty and so cue MIDI
okay so I have been wearing this blush
for like two weeks straight and I can't
stop so it's not a monthly favorite but
I'm someone talking about it because you
need this this is a satin touch blush by
the brand essence and this isn't a shade
fashion love oh my gosh this color is so
freaking beautiful and it doesn't even
look like I've used that much like the
print is still there and I know I've
only been using it for two weeks but I
cannot stop using it I have a few more
of the satin touch blushes but this one
is my favorite and not just because it's
a nude but I love the undertone in this
nude it goes with so many different
looks you could do a peach eye and it
would paradise or a really cool toned
eye and it would still look nice this
would be an absolutely stunning blush
for brides because it almost has like a
really really subtle sheen to it it
looks matte when you look at it in the
pan I feel like that's what makes it so
special but when you start to blend it
out it gives you like this glow from
within even though it's not a glowy
blush it's the blush I'm wearing on my
cheeks today it is only a few dollars I
purchased mine at Ulta or on the essence
website I don't remember where I got it
so I recently did an entire video
testing out coqui cosmetics and there
were a ton of things that impressed me
in that video but one of the things that
truly impressed me so much and I haven't
been able to put it down since is the
volume and length mascara I always
rotate about three mascaras at the same
time so I try to get use out of all the
ones I have and this one has really been
in the mix it gives me everything I want
I think I like this cookie one almost as
much as my Kiko Cokie is giving Kiko of
those fruits money that's funny to me
I feel like this gives me extreme length
extreme volume and sometimes it's hard
to find a mascara that can give you both
and this really does I'm wearing it on
my lashes today and I don't know I feel
like they look pretty but luminous I'm
pretty long I truly love this it doesn't
on me doesn't smudge it keeps a curl all
day like I love this I love you
the em cosmetics infinite lip clouds
have been standout products for me this
month
ever since I tried it not too long ago I
cannot put these down they're so
comfortable to wear the formula is
amazing they are liquid lipsticks but
they're more of a moosie consistency but
they don't slip and slide everywhere it
doesn't like smear on my face when I'm
eating or anything like that they do sit
down they eventually set but they're
still in a little bit of transfer let me
show you see like there is a little bit
of transfer there but it's not too much
so I really love that and they feel so
comfortable they really do feel like
little clumps I have little lip clubs
that's what it feels like the name is
perfect this formula is amazing
especially for nudes I have been wearing
Rose nude and French nude the most out
of the entire collection today I
actually mixed both of them and put them
on my lips I thought why not but the one
that I've been using the most is ros
nude it is the most beautiful rose
mousse and then the other lip product I
wanted to mention are these guys these
are the Sephora collection outrageous
plump effect lip glosses and I believe
they have four colors but I only
purchase three of them one two and three
literally that's what they're called
zero one zero two and 0 3 and these are
so good I'm not one to really love a
plumping lip gloss the only one that
plumps a little bit and tingles a little
bit that I truly love are the buxom lip
glosses the full-on lip creams they
tingle and they feel minty but they
don't hurt or burn or anything like that
I don't really feel like they plump my
lips at all but those are the only ones
I truly love these are extremely similar
to the buxom one these actually plump
your lips though the buxom ones I don't
notice anything I actually notice a
little bit of something when I put
things on I'm not going to lie on my
lips to look a little pouty or maybe
it's in my mind but I feel like I see a
difference and they even smell a little
bit like lip plumpers you don't scent
that lip plumper scent this has a little
bit which I like by the way I think it
smells really good and then it has kind
of like a vanilla twist to that in case
anybody was wondering I feel like these
plums the lips a little bit in the most
comfortable way possible they don't stay
enough these make your lips look juicy
without hurting you
and I really appreciate that Sephora I
really do clean up too sticky they are a
little bit sticky but there are a little
bit longer lasting because of that and I
do like the pigmentation of these
they're not too pigmented but they're
not too sheer it's they really are the
perfect plumping lip glosses I mean I
really love these I would say my
favorite one in the nude one but how
feeling I'm gonna use this one a lot in
the summer time okay guys and then my
last favorite is a moisturizer this is
from the brand peels and this is the
ultra facial moisturizer for all skin
types and I specifically use this as a
primer when my skin is Sahara Desert dry
sometimes I wake up and my skin feels
normal like not too dry nice and supple
but sometimes my skin goes through
something where it is like dry this baby
this baby right here was the answer I
was looking for my friend Gaby put me on
to this she's a makeup artist and she
does all my makeup for like my photo
shoots and stuff and about a month ago
we did a photo shoot and she used this
as a primer and my skin never looked
better
it looked so hydrated and beautiful even
though I was putting kind of like a semi
matte foundation on top my skin looks
dewy it was crazy and she was telling me
that Kylie Jenner's makeup artist
actually uses this on kylie jenner she
went to a guru she make up class and her
Roush was talking all about this and how
much she loved it and then Gaby started
using it and loved it and then she
passed it on to me and now I can't stop
using this and I love it a little such a
long way if you have oily skin I don't
know if you're going to like this at all
because this makes your face look shiny
like very moisturized very shiny very
healthy very very healthy and I find
this to just be a really great base for
makeup I think it even makes my makeup
last longer throughout the day and I
really just wanted to mention this
because if you have dry skin out there
and you find that even the dewy Asst
primer doesn't work try this out because
foundation will just slide right on top
sink right into the skin and there will
not be a dry skin in sight that one dry
patch you won't see them they'll be gone
okay guys so that completes this video
