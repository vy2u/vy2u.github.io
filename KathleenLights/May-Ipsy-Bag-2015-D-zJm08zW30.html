my May if si bag unboxing I actually
feel like crap today I didn't even brush
my hair my wisdom tooth is killing me
like and it's not so much like it hurts
and I have I'm taking like meant like
meds like pain meds so it doesn't really
hurt it's the uncomfortableness of the
fact that I'm biting down on my gums
since the gum is like on top of the
tooth and I can't even close my mouth
all the way it's just frustrating I have
a headache like above my eyes and I look
at it and I just don't feel good but I
really really need to get this video up
so here I am I'm actually really excited
about this month's hypsi bag because I
already saw the bag like my friend um I
subscribed to Ipsy as well and she
showed me what the bag looks like and it
is the cutest bag like let's get into it
and this is how cute is this bag
it says contents pretty important stuff
breakups to make up this is the cute
honestly okay this is the cutest bag if
she has ever had ever and I've been
subscribed to Ipsy for a very long time
like it is the cutest the inside is
lime-green does it get cuter does it get
cuter I usually really don't care about
the bags like I care about what's on the
inside but I'm so keeping I am so
keeping this in my purse like this is my
new makeup bag okay so the first thing I
see immediately is this guy this is the
Urban Decay revolution high color lip
gloss oh wait a minute oh I see what
this is here okay this is like the two
little samples of the lip gloss right
here fail bait and bittersweet and then
it says use ozone lip liner to prime
this is a really good sample
the lipliner it is a clear I don't know
i'm swatching it you can't see it but
it's a clear lip liner so that your lip
products don't feather or bleed which is
really good for lip gloss so that is a
really cute little thing that they gave
a pretty big size of this and then you
have like two samples here I'm not crazy
about like little samples like this but
I mean I really like this I'm very
impressed with this I believe that the
full size of this is like twenty dollars
okay moving on the next thing in my bag
is this this is an eyeshadow brush I'm
obsessed with blending brushes this is a
tapered blending brush I'm obsessed with
these I feel like you can't go wrong
with this like I mean you really can't I
have like a ton of these and I love them
and actually really like this brand I
have a contouring brush from this brand
that they included in an Ipsy bag a
couple months ago that my friend gave me
because she got it in her FC bag so I'm
really excited to get this because this
is a really great brand like my
contouring brush is amazing quality and
this feels like amazing quality my
stomach hurts okay next thing is this
guy this is the bellapierre cosmetics
gel eyeliner in Ebony this is good I'm
glad that they decided to give a black
color because I feel like black or brown
or a nude is something that a lot of
people use all the time instead of like
purple or pink or green I feel like a
lot of people get a lot of use out of
this this next thing is like a tiny
little this by the way is full-size and
so is this so two full-size products so
far
I'll leave the price of every product in
the description box just cuz I have my
phone near me and I usually google it
and my phone is dead and charging in my
kitchen so I will leave the prices of
everything below so this next one is
like a tiny little sample
I mean it's not tiny but it's the Aimee
Aimee naturally kind morning dew matte
finish a moisturizer controls oiliness
and shine hydrates and softens so I'm
gonna be passing this
because anything that says Matt I'm like
not about that life
my skin is that dry so I'm probably
going to give this to a friend of mine
who has like really oily skin and then
the last thing is this it is a Brio geo
ross Arkell milk Ross are Camile
reparative leave-in conditioning spray
it has rosehip argan and coconut oil and
then in parentheses says Ross Arco blend
Oh Rose / rosehip are for Argan and KO
for coconut Ross Argo alright
I love the brand Rio Gio you guys know
that the curl charisma is like my go-to
curly hair product I love it I says to
spray it when your hair is damp but I'm
gonna do it anyway
ooh that smells really good I love REO
geo and I feel like nothing Brio geo
does is bad so I highly recommend trying
this out in your ape sea bag like if you
got it and you're like no try it
big guys so that was everything I got in
this one sip tea bag I am so impressed
this month like wow I'm so impressed
okay number one my favorite thing is
this bag this bag is amazing amazing I
think like I would pay $10 for this
maybe not 10 this is great I love the
size it's good for travel this is
amazing amazing and this is amazing
because it's just like a black gel liner
now I don't know if it lasts on the
waterline or if it smudges but just
these two things are so worth it to me
Oh Ellen this and this um ozone lip
liner is actually really good I've tried
it in the past this is a really really
really good bag sometimes with Ipsy I'm
like ah and I'm going with you know this
is a really great bag like you go--if
see it was so good this month leave me a
