my Ipsy bag unbagging I wanted to get
this video a little bit sooner but when
my Ipsy bag got here I was already in
Vegas this video is for those of you who
voted for more tips videos I hear you I
know you'll like it
so let's open it so the card inside says
greetings from and you're supposed to
like put where you're from really cute
probably not gonna do it I haven't
brushed my hair in days this is what the
bag looks like this month I actually
really like this bag it has like
different parts from around the world
like that's in Brazil that's in New York
a gang got rule an airplane like that's
really cute I really like their theme
it's like a destination and it opens
kind of like an envelope like I like he
will see okay so the first thing here is
from the brand of n I'm not sure if
that's how you say it
this says it's my seller lotion
struggling to read this bottle because
the bottles clear and the words are like
grey I can barely read it I'm guessing
this is just like my seller water kind
of like Bioderma but it says my seller
lotion that's throw me off yeah I
thought for some reason it was gonna be
a little bit oily because it said lotion
but no this just feels like regular
water but this actually would be great
to travel with I'm guessing that
products in this bag are like good for
travel so this is great to like take
your makeup off on the go
says it's non comedogenic and good for
sensitive skin hyper allergenic next
thing in the bag is this little guy
right here this is from the brand called
Hana Lai Hanalei and it says it's a lip
treatment and that's all it says that's
all I got I mean I'm sure the Ipsy
website tells you in detail what
everything is and what you can use it
for but I totally wish they had it on
the card
this looks very similar to the agave lip
mask or the bomb.com by glossier which
is like one of my favorite lip
treatments oh I'm definitely going to be
using this I could always use a lip balm
or lip treatment always I'm always up
for trying new ones I will have the
prices down below for like the full size
item as I always do info down below okay
next thing in the bag is
right here this looks like it's a
full-size product and it is a radiant
shimmer bronzer by the brand Hikari I've
actually I think I've heard of this
brand before I'm not sure um it's not
what I expected
this definitely has like blush colors in
it as well I don't know how I feel about
thee let's swatch it so this is each
strip individually right here on the
back of my hand and now I'm going to mix
them all together oh nice
I actually really like that color this
is the color of all of it mixed together
it kind of creates more of like a rose
gold when you mix it in with this pink
right here and we want something a
little bit less pinky just dip into
these shades don't know how I feel about
this even though I really do like this
color but I like it more as like an
eyeshadow I don't think I would like
this for my face because usually I use
bigger bronzer brushes and like the
whole pinky thing kind of throws me off
maybe I was like a blush topper that
would look really pretty okay two more
things in the bag this is the Smashbox
x-rated Volume Mascara
I already have mascara on so I can't try
this on but I think my sister says she
really likes this mascara is it this one
I'm not sure I love traveling mascaras
because they're the best to troll with
they really are there's a little but
Smashbox is a high-end brand so that's
awesome that they have it in the bag
this month this alone is probably like
11 or $12 I'm gonna assume which is more
than you pay for your PC bag so that's
pretty awesome and then the last thing
in the bag is nail polish I love missile
nail polish it's from the brand Aurora
New York actually never heard of this
brand but I'm oh that is a fiery pink I
really love neon Pink's like this gel
effect nail lacquer made in Italy I am
loving this color this would be so
amazing for summertime yeah I know that
my FC videos are so so short but that's
pretty much it
I actually really do like the bag this
month the only thing I'm not too crazy
about is that bronzer because that pink
kind of throws me off the lip treatment
looks like something I definitely would
like let me know what you got in your FC
bag this month

different things did you like your bag
this month did it suck did you hate it

awesome that is it's that it's nail
lacquer made and it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
