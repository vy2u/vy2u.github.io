my Ipsy bag unbinding I actually did get
my Ipsy bag early this month this video
is going to be late but that's my fault
I got this like on the 10th of this
month that is very rare for me so I'm
very proud of you I can't believe how
long I've been doing it see bag videos
on my channel I was actually thinking
about that today I was like wow
it's been a long time life goes by so
incredibly fast it is crazy but that's
not what the video is about today we are
just going to dive right into this bag
and get started
and try out these products the card said
your summer story starts here this is
what the bag looks like this month I
actually really like it it's different
from the usual HD bags we get it's a
little bit bigger I feel and a half ice
creams on it ok so the first thing in
the bag is this guy right here this is
the South Maine macadamia oil treatment
for all hair types it says apply a coin
sized amount to dry or damp hair
avoiding the root area I actually think
it's a really good size for Ipsy like
for the back being only ten dollars I
think this is a really good size oil
because even oil in bottles this size
are pretty pricey so I do think this is
a pretty good size the only thing I will
say about this is the first ingredient
is domestic owned which is silicon and
I'm trying not to use so many silicone
products on my hair not because they're
damaging they're not damaging it just
coats the hair instead of really
nourishing it and I'm sure Mike anemia
oil is really nourishing but I wish that
was like the only ingredient or like
macadamia oil and then some other stuff
just not simethicone as the first
ingredient and now I'm starting to think
I kind of want to look at the
ingredients in some of my other oils I
have in my bathroom anyway I'm sure this
is a great oil I'm just not going to use
it on my hair because I will be giving
this away to one of my friends who
doesn't care about putting silicone on
their hair I know about hair actually
cut my hair I know you guys can't tell
in my videos but my hair was almost
touching my butt crack that's how long
it got I got so out of control I don't
know I don't even remember the last time
I cut my hair and I don't know why
because I get trims pretty often but my
hair was extremely long so I
cottage and I like it I really like it i
iron my hair today and it took me half
the time I'm actually going to wait for
it to grow a little bit more and then
I'm going to do some Bali oz like very
subtle balayage and then I'm going to
put some layers into it as well quick
little hair update not that any of you
asked but I told you anyway so next up
is the pur Lisse BB tinted moist as PS
30 it says it has a natural looking
coverage with a flawless finish it's
supposed to be for all skin types even
sensitive it doesn't write even okay so
this is the reason I'm not wearing any
foundation on my face I'm going to zoom
you guys in so we could try this out
okay so I'm going to prime my skin with
my pores no more Luminizer primer from
dr. brandt and the only reason I'm doing
this is because I would normally do this
no matter what face product I was
putting on so I want to make sure I'm
doing all the steps you know I just
noticed the smells a little eucalyptus
II this smells like a spa what how do I
never notice that okay so I typically
apply BB creams with a brush versus a
Beauty Blender just to try to get a bit
more coverage out of them and now I'm
just going to take some of this onto my
brush oh my gosh I hope this is my color
oh it's in the shade medium oh no it
looks like it might be a good match both
also means hair oh no
Wow especially really nice coverage for
a BB cream I expected something
extremely sheer especially since the
front says natural looking coverage that
usually means like coverages and I mean
this is not full coverage by any means
but I think it's covering really well
considering a BB cream this also says on
the back of the tube that it features an
exclusive Asian herb extract complex
it also has chamomile that's supposed to
soothe the skin I like anything that's
supposed to soothe the skin I have
pretty sensitive skin and dry skin so I
don't know I'm kind of liking this okay
so I'm just going to take a little bit
more on my brush and see if I can build
up the coverage a bit on my cheeks okay
so I do think adding a little bit more
here did give me some more coverage and
I think I really really really like this
the finish is so dewy and so beautiful
like my skin looks so natural and fresh
it does feel like I figured it was going
to be pretty tacky because it looks dewy
so you might want to set this but it it
can take away the doing it I feel like
this would be perfect for a beach day
you do get some SPF SPF 30 at that which
is nice I typically like to wear like
SPF 50 on my face I'm like a SPF 50 gal
but I'll just dirty on my face and it's
really nice if you do wear this to the
beach you can just keep reapplying okay
so I'm going to go ahead and put on my
concealer my powder my bronzer all that
stuff and I will be right back
okay so base off first impression I
think I really really like this BB cream
obviously when I put all the powder
products on top it kind of modified the
look of it but I still think it's so
pretty and natural so this was a big
winner for me so far okay so I knew it
Sammy
all righty then so the next thing in the
bag is this guy this is the Urban Decay
afterglow 8 hour powder highlighter and
this is in the shade sin I didn't say
that
this is in the shade spin I believe I
have this what happened oh I guess not
this is really strange because I
remember having this highlight I don't
know if I gave it away to somebody I
don't can I get rid of it I don't know I
don't even remember what this looks like
on the face honestly but I'm just going
to pull it out to this little thing it's
one of those champagne colors but it's a
little bit more of like a light gold
kind of like a mixture of champagne and
white gold I'm going to go ahead and use
the brush that's in the Ipsy bag with
this product might as well this is from
the brand Luxy beauty and this is the
660 precision foundation brush I
personally wouldn't use this for
foundation I would probably use this to
like set my under eye concealer or maybe
to like blend out under-eye concealer or
maybe like really targeted blush this
would be nice but I personally wouldn't
use this for foundation but I actually
really do love this brand so I got
really excited when I saw that I have
this in the bag because I do not own
this brush okay so I'm just going to
take this little guy and this is
definitely bigger than what I would
normally use to highlight but you know
just to utilize this kind of pulp that
on my cheeks actually not bad for
highlighting this brush this highlight
though feels a little dry I don't know
if it's because this is a sample even
though it looks pretty on camera like
and looks a little dry when you first
apply it not much comes off on your
cheeks you do have to apply a few layers
so I actually really like this brush for
highlighting that gets a thumbs up for
me this highlight though it is not my
favorite it's pretty subtle so you do
have to build it up and usually I really
like that about highlights but I feel
like with this once you get the intense
pigmentation you want it looks pretty
dry on the skin and it looks a little
pottery and then when I look straight
ahead I don't know if you can tell on
camera but you can kind of see like this
white patch here from all the layers I
did but if I didn't do that then you
wouldn't really see much of a glow so
I'm not a fan of this okay I mean I
might as well just show you the last
product in here it's a lip product this
is from the brand trusty this is their
mini matte lip crayon and it is in this
really pretty red shade it's called
Tuscan wine
by the way guys I know I state this in
every Ipsy video but I will leave all
the products I use in this video in the
description bar below with their prices
right next to them just in case you guys
want to know how much these things cost
okay so I really really love this color
it's such a beautiful red and the
formula feels really nice it's matte but
it's not drying whatsoever the only
thing I don't like is the applicator
because it's round like this and it's
not really thin it's not as easy to
apply I kind of messed up here you said
let's let the I feel like lipsticks are
a little bit more precise this was just
a little bigger and a little bit rounder
so it's harder to navigate and if you
got this and you found this to be the
case as well the only thing you have to
do is just use a lip brush and kind of
line your lips with it and then just go
on top of it with this and you'll get a
more precise application like that or
put on a red lip liner underneath and
then put this on top but I really really
like this color okay guys so that
completes this video that was everything
that was in my may if si bag I actually
really loved this month if si bag the
only thing I didn't really love was the
highlighter it was just a little too dry
for me and I won't be using this but the
rest of the stuff I was like really
impressive leave me a comment down below
what you got in your bag this month did
you love it did you hate it did we get
the same things let me know in a comment
below that completes this video guys
