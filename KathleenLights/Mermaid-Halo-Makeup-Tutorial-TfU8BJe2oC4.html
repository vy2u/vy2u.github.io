a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now it's an extremely
colorful and extremely random makeup
look but I wanted to play around with
this newest ela liquid eye shadow in the
shade Sunset Cove but when I went to
apply it on my lid I just I didn't like
how it looks it just wasn't blending as
well as I wanted it to for me this color
specifically is just a little bit harder
to work with versus the other ones I
have when I was doing this I off-camera
I was doing it first and I kind of
struggled to use this but I made it work
in the end and I really liked how the
look turned out I just put an eyeshadow
on top of this and then it turned out
fine this is totes not a wearable look
at all not very wearable but I thought
it would be fun to create if you want to
see how to get this mermaid inspired
look then just keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyes and
now I'm going to go in with this makeup
geek eyeshadow in the shade carnival and
I'm going to use this to buff into my
crease and I'm really going to be
generous with this eye shadow I am
applying it really heavily in the crease
and just blowing it out and I do that
for a while until I get the color I want
like the color intensity that I want and
then I took another makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade hot pants and
this is really random but I just put
this pretty much everywhere on my entire
lid don't know why but this that I was
just kind of winging this eyeshadow look
I didn't know what I wanted to do so I
was just grabbing random colors then I
went in with the morphe eyeshadow in the
shade and I'm applying this to the outer
corners and to the inner corners as well
so we're going to do this slowly create
that halo look and we're going to leave
that Center completely bare well not
completely bare with that other
eyeshadow underneath and I'm just taking
that great day shadow and I'm connecting
it into my crease so the only part that
I don't want this purple shadow to be on
is the center of the lid
then I took the Sela Sunset Cove liquid
eyeshadow I did it because I did it on
the other eye and it wouldn't make sense
not to do it but I cover it up with
something else but I just applied that
to my lid and kind of blended it out
with a brush and then I went in with the
sparkle baby palette by sugarpill
and I took the shade candy crush and I
applied that right on top of the Stila
liquid shadow and I feel like the Stila
shadow kind of acted like a glue and
really intensified the sugarpill shadow
and then i went back in with my morphe
shadow and i'm just intensifying
everything going back in with that
sugarpill shade just making sure
everything is nice and blended just
repeating the same steps over and over
and making sure that it's the intensity
that I want I'm going to go back into
the carnival eye shadow and just add
some more to my crease to make the look
pop a little bit more I'm going to take
the Urban Decay heavy-metal glitter in
the shade Distortion and I'm going to
focus this right on top of the sugarpill
shadow so it's nice and glittery when
you turn your head I love it and then
highlight my brow bone I just took the
makeup geek eyeshadow in the shade of
white lies so to start off my face I'm
going to take the pixie milky mix just
to hydrate my skin of it and then I went
in with the new Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD skin booster I think I really like
this but I don't want to say anything
just yet because I'm still testing it
out and for foundation I'm going in with
my choices close out the LA girl Pro
coverage HD foundation and I'm in the
shade of fair and I'm just applying this
with a Beauty Blender it's a very very
dewy foundation I think it looks nice
and natural I love it for underneath my
eyes I'm trying out this new product
this is the eldest reveal color
correcting eye serum I bought this
because my dark circles are doing pretty
bad these days I'm not getting much
sleep and I'm pretty good reviews I
wanted to test it out so I'm applying
that underneath my concealer just to
cover up my dark circles a little bit
and then I went in with the heart-shaped
tape concealer not that this isn't full
coverage on its own but I just wanted to
do a little bit
color correcting and I'm blending that
underneath my eyes and between my brows
on my nose on my chin just to even
everything out because that concealer is
a little bit lighter than my foundation
well a lot lighter than my foundation to
set down the concealer I took my NYC
smooth skin loose setting powder and I
set my concealer down but then I went
ahead and just set my entire face pretty
much because the foundation I use is
pretty tacky I just wanted to set it
down okay so I started on my under eyes
when I realized I wasn't recording but I
took the sugarpill eyes shadow in the
shade mochi and on a pencil brush I just
ran that underneath my lower lash line
and then I took the morphe great day
shadow and I'm focusing this on the
outer corners and the inner corners I'm
just mirroring my top lid so just
exactly like how it looks on the top I
just want the middle to be there and
then I go back in with the sugar pill I
shadow just to intensify the blue of it
just to blend everything out I went in
with the carnival eyeshadow by makeup
geek making sure everything just blends
nicely together and to brighten up my
waterline I could see Marc Jacobs
eyeliner engage a blue and blend it out
some more
so for mascara I took my benefit roller
lash mascara I applied that to my top
and bottom lashes and then for my inner
corners I took the makeup geek spoiled
eyeshadow in the shade at whimsical and
then to finish up the eye they took
three salon perfect falsies in six one
five and I just pop them on they're very
spiky and spidery but I think it looks
cool with this look to contour my face
I'm going to take the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer I like saying like that I
just can't say butter bronzer I have to
say butter I'm putting on my butter
bronzer I'm contouring with a fan brush
a fluffy fan brush and then I wanted to
warm up the skin and add kind of like an
overall glowy bronzed look so I took the
makeup revolution vivid baked bronzer in
the shade golden days I love it just
warms up the skin so nicely I kind of
adds a nice Sheen and then for blush I
went in with the Charlotte Tilbury cheek
to cheek blush in the shade of first
love it's a very natural everyday blush
I love it and then to highlight I'm
actually taking two shades one of them
is a little pointless and you
why in a second but I took the cap on
the alchemists holographic palette and I
took the purple one it's called
ultraviolet amethyst and I just
highlighted um excuse me and I just
highlighted with this shade and then I
went in with the bare minerals invisible
glow powder and medium and I don't like
this I feel like didn't really add
anything I kind of wanted it to tone
down the purple mist but it pretty much
did nothing but anyway I went in with my
lip color this is the Milani liquid
lipstick in the shade pretty and I
wanted something kind of like a Barbie
pink but I wanted to tone it down just a
little bit so I took the bare minerals
gloss in the shade groovy and I just
blended it in on top okay guys so that
