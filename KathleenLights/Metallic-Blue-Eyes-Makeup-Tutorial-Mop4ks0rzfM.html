tutorial on this look right here I
wanted to do something blue because I
was really inspired by this palette
right here this is the morphe 35c I know
that everybody's using the 35o palette
right now which is calling my name cuz
it's full of oranges and those are my
favorite kinds of colors but I thought
you know what I'm gonna step out of my
comfort zone I'm not gonna do an orange
smokey eye today I'm gonna do a blue one
so I just focused on the blue colors in
this palette this is a very pigmented
palette pretty freakin amazing I will
link it down below if you're interested
so yes I think it's really pretty
sometimes blue scares me and sometimes I
feel like I can't pull it off but I
decided to run with it and if you want
to see how to get this look then just
keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyes with
my Mac 24 hour extended eye base and I
did go into this palette as well not
just the morphe palette this is the Too
Faced naturally matte palette because
the morphe one lacks crease shades and
stuff like that so I just applied that
vanilla color on my entire lid to set
the primer and now I'm going in with
this one I believe it was called
cashmere bunny on a fluffy brush and
that's going to be my transition shade
then I'm taking that really intense blue
in the palette now this one does work a
lot better with fix+ so I just sprayed
some fix+
on my brush this is an elf brush and I
dipped it back into the eyeshadow and
then applied it like that onto my lid so
it can be really really really intense
and frosty now I'm gonna take this matte
navy blue and on this little pencil
brush I'm just going to start applying
this into my crease now this look looks
a little messy and sloppy before it
looks good so you know just take your
time with it I'm just putting this into
my crease back and forth and trying to
blend the shimmery blue with the matte
blue then I'm going into this color
called honey butter this is in the Too
Faced palette and on a fluffy crease
brush I am just trying to blend out the
harsh lines and then I'm going to do the
same thing with chocolate crap just
trying to blend
everything into the crease this look
requires a lot a lot of blending then
I'm gonna go back into that blue I'm not
going to spray fix+ but I'm just going
to intensify the lid a little bit more
since you blend so much a lot of it does
get blended away now I'm going into this
other shimmery navy blue the other one
was like a matte navy blue this one's a
shimmery one and I'm doing the same
thing I did with the navy blue just make
sure everything is nice and blended and
all the crease colors fade into each
other back again with cashmere bunny and
I am just further blending muscle
blending loads and loads of living I'm
going to take this Coastal Scents brush
and this matte black in the palette and
I'm going to start packing this on the
outer corners I want the drama to be
like on the outer corner of the lid I
wanted to go from like black to blue so
I'm just packing on that black and I
guess I forgot I was filming a tutorial
but I just put that vanilla shade under
my brow bone the same one I used on my
lid okay so I'm moving on to my face
before I finish my eyes I am priming my
face with the Becca backlight filter
primer believe that's what it's called I
am obsessed with this I think it's
amazing then I went in with the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation in shell
beige I believe does the number I have
and I'm using this with a real
techniques complexion sponge and I am
just bouncing that on my whole face I
love this foundation but I do need to
use a very luminizing primer and a
sponge with it because if not it looks
too dry and cakey then underneath my
eyes I decided to use my NARS creamy
radiant concealer I haven't used it in a
hot minute so I'm using vanilla
underneath my eyes and I'm also
highlighting with this and I'm just
blending everything out with the same
Real Techniques sponge
now I'm going to take the laura mercier
translucent setting powder and I'm just
going to set my under eye concealer so
moving on to my face again I mean my
eyes this is max nylon eyeshadow it's a
really intense color so I use that in my
under corners then I'm going to take
this Tarte TARDIS gel liner cream liner
thing and this is a little Sigma brush
and I'm taking this liner all the way
into my inner corners like my inner
tear-duct as you can see and then I'm
dragging that on my waterline so not
only am i doing a wing with this but I'm
going to put it in my inner corners like
a cat eye Egyptian kind of effect and on
my waterline and then I'm just gonna do
a little flick and this is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara and for my
bottom lashes I wanted a blue color I
thought it would look really cool so
this is the they're real mascara by
benefit in their blue shade and it's
really really cool I like how I turned
out I think it's different I didn't put
any eyeshadow on my lower lashes just
for a little bit of a change and then I
put on some falsies those were the
morphe demi wispies so to contour I'm
going to do a soft contour with my girl
lactic Cobo bronzer this is a morphe G
something brush from the gunmetal
collection it's their powder brush and
I'm just using this brush because it
does apply a soft amount like a light
amount of product so I'm just contouring
and bronzing with that for my highlight
I am using colourpop's wisp highlight
it's beautiful and I love applying this
with a sponge I can apply it with a
synthetic brush too but I really like
how this sponge applies it
I'm also highlighting my nose you know
okay so for blush I am using the
Clinique nude pop blush pop
for my lips I'm taking colourpop's lip
liner in BFF and I'm just gonna line my
entire lips with this like all over the
place all over my lips and then I'm just
going to top it off with the NARS lip
gloss in the shade Chelsea girls Chelsea
girls and then that completes this look
I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank

will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
