tutorial on the look I'm wearing I
wanted to do a full face drugstore look
using affordable brushes as well so
that's what I'm doing today if you can
tell by my voice I woke up with like a
nasty cold this morning I tried to film
early on in the day but I just felt so
bad but I took some medicine and I'm not
feeling so fainty right now so I decided
to quickly sit down and film for you I'm
just into Zee colourful water lines
these days it's spring I'm feeling it
I'm also wearing a metallic liquid
lipstick which is so cool it's like Matt
but metallic I like it
so if you want to see how to get this
look then just keep watching so the
first thing I'm going to do is prime my
eyelids using the Milani shadow stick
and almond cream this is just going to
make all the veins disappear and give me
a nice base for my eye shadow and then I
just set that with some translucent
powder I'm going to go into this LA
Colors eyeshadow this is in the shade
bear mauve which it's not love it's like
a very warm beige e Brown these are like
a dollar or like $2 each they're not the
best I shadow is there a little bit
powdery but they get the job done for
the price and I just pretty much put
that everywhere as you saw I wanted
something very minimal for my lids so I
just grabbed a pretty neutral color and
then I highlighted my brow bone with the
reserve your cabana highlight from wet
and wild to tightline i used some black
eyeliner by Catrice and then i went in
with the pixie lash line ink and i just
really really struggled with this
eyeliner it was the first time I used it
and I have to say I do not recommend it
it was very drawing I couldn't really
get my wing as precise as I wanted to
because of all the tugging but anyway
put on some mascara and then I went in
with these Camelia's lashes by kiss I
got them at Walgreens and they're very
beautiful very natural I love them so
I'm going to prime my face with the NYX
born to glow illuminator and then I went
in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum
this isn't a drugstore product in the
States but you can get bourgeois at the
drugstore overseas
so it technically is a drugstore product
just not for us Americans anyway so I'm
going to go ahead and apply some
concealer I'm using the Rimmel wake me
up concealer and then on top I'm using
the Wet n Wild highlighting pen and the
shade ivory into you it's a really great
highlighting pen it's very creamy it's
kind of like a dewy finish and I'm using
a smaller elf blush know a smaller elf
brush to just blend that all in now I'm
going to set my under eye concealer
using my NYC smooth skin loose
translucent powder I actually really
like this it doesn't look drying on my
skin okay so this is the only product
that you cannot get at the drugstore but
it is a drugstore price this is Zulu by
color pop it's one of their eyeliners
it's kind of like a mint turquoise shade
so I'm just applying that everywhere and
just buffing that in with a Milani brush
then I took that same color of eyeshadow
and just kind of helped blend those two
colors together and then I took a nyx
prismatic eyeshadow in the shade mir
made it's a really reflective greeny
blue tle colored so pretty I'm just
applying this right on top of that
eyeliner this is just a palette I
created on the NYX website
I also brought that into my inner
corners and then I took girl-talk which
is also a NYX prismatic eyeshadow and I
applied that right on top for bronzer
i'm using my Physicians Formula but a
bronzer I'm taking the Real Techniques
contour brush and I am just contouring
with this bronzer
after that I took the ELF stippling
brush this is the travel one and I'm
just adding some more bronzer just to
give myself a little bit more of a
bronzed glow for blush I'm using the
Milani baked blush in the shade Luminoso
the best Milani blush ever so pretty I'm
applying that with my Real Techniques
multi-task
brush and then I'm going to set my face
with the Wet n Wild photo focus setting
spray and then I'm going to highlight
the tops of my cheekbones using the wet
and wild bronzer but it's not a bronzer
in the shade reserve your Cabana
this is just a morphe fan brush and I'm
just popping that everywhere and then
for my lips I'm using the trees Katrice
country guess the Catrice ultimate stay
lipliner in the shade rosy Brown and
then I'm topping it off with the Milani
amore metallic lip cream in the shade
chromatic addict which is a matte
metallic color that completes this video
