a review and swatches on the new Milani
by the eyes eye shadows I do have all 30
to share with you guys today I'm going
to be showing you swatches and telling
you my thoughts on them and giving you
my top favorite ones the ones that I
think are worth buying out of all 30 of
them just in case you were interested in
them I kind of want to tell you my
personal favorites and the ones that I
think are the best quality so Milani
launched these eyeshadows and they are
supposed to be a gel powder whatever
that means I'm not exactly sure when I
first got them I thought they were going
to be a little bit like bouncy or like
jelly kind of powders but they're not
they do feel like regular eyeshadows but
they are really really smooth to the
touch on the website it says that these
eyeshadows started as a gel and then
they use something to transform them
into a powder which makes them really
really soft I want this video to be too
long this is what the packaging looks
like it's their basic Milani packaging
they're baked blushes and bronzers and
all that have that typical gold
packaging that I actually really like so
there are 30 different colors to choose
from and there are brown ones white ones
green ones purple ones pink ones they
have a bunch of different colors to suit
everybody's needs I've been playing with
these eyeshadows quite a bit so I do
have my thoughts on them that I will get
into right after the swatches so let's
get started the first one is called
Bella white and it is a satin matte
finish and it's just your basic white
eyeshadow it does go on pretty pigmented
and really creamy on the eyes I really
like this one
this next one is called Bella diamond
and it's pretty much the same as Bella
white only it is a highlighter shimmer
um finish it's a shimmer finish and it
is really really similar to Bella white
I guess the finish is just a little bit
different and I actually prefer Bella
white more but this one is still pretty
good as a highlight and we have Bella
chiffon I really really love this shade
it looks like a white eyeshadow in the
pan but once you have
yellow undertone but once you swatch it
it really gives off a beautiful golden
Sheen this is a shimmer finish and I
think it is really pretty then we have a
Bella ivory which is just like an
off-white color it has like that creamy
pink undertone and this could also be
used as a highlight it is a satin matte
finish so if you're into more matte
highlights then this one's a good one
and there is Bella champagne which is a
really gorgeous champagne color you do
have to work with this one a little bit
though it is a shimmer finish and I feel
like I have to dip my brush in a couple
of times to get a really good color
payoff but it is still a really pretty
wearable everyday color then there's
Bella sand it is a shimmer eyeshadow I
really really like this one it's like a
light light light neutral gold color
this would be a really pretty all-over
lid shade and yeah I really like this
one then there is a Bella cafe this is
probably my favorite like brown color
out of the bunch it is more of a cool
tone brown but this is the perfect
perfect crease color in my opinion if
you are looking for a nice matte it is a
satin matte finish if you're looking for
a nice matte brown from the drugstore
this is a good one
then there's Bella cappuccino which is a
lot like Bella cafe a little bit more
warm so it is also a set and matte
finish just a little bit more warm like
I said so if you're into more warm
pre-shape then pick up by the cappuccino
it's also a really nice pigmented one we
have Bella espresso and love this one a
lot - it is a deep chocolatey brown
color you can't go wrong with shades
like this because they're perfect to
smudge underneath your lash line or if
you're using the crease or in the outer
corners of your eyes and this one is
definitely pigmented enough to do so the
next one is Bella taupe and it is a set
and matte finish I'm not super crazy
about this one because it is a little
bit dusty
I do not explain it like when I try to
blend this into my crease the more I
blend like the more it kind of looks
like patchy or it doesn't really go on
right at least on my lids it doesn't um
but yeah it's still a pretty color and I
could definitely use it I just have to
work
a little bit harder the next one is
Bella bronze and this is right up my
alley it is a nice bronze color I
absolutely love this one this is
definitely like top five for me it goes
on super super pigmented not patchy at
all and it is a metallic finish and it
is Gor just this one is Bella gold and
it is such a stunning gold color but it
doesn't go on as pretty as its watches
if that makes any sense
when you swatch it on your finger it has
like the most gorgeous Sheen but you
definitely have to build this color up
on your lid it's one of those colors I
give to continue to dip your brush into
the product and then apply on your eyes
to get the most color payoff but it's
still gorgeous gold color then we have
Bella copper it is another really really
beautiful copper shade it's not as
pigmented as the Bella bronze color you
do have to build this one up as well but
once you do it's a beautiful beautiful
beautiful copper shade and there is
Bella mandarin one of my all-time
favorites out of all of them this is a
satin matte finish and it is a beautiful
beautiful like Mandarin color it has a
little bit of peach pink and orange and
it's super super pigmented it's a
beautiful beautiful crease color like
really gorgeous crease color when you're
dealing with colors like this it's
perfect for summer I absolutely love
this one
the next one is Bella black and I was
super disappointed in this one actually
it looks super super intense and when
you swatch it it has really amazing
intensity like on your finger but trying
to use this eye shadow it just did not
work for me it was the kind of black
that every time I kept trying to put it
like in the outer V to darken up the
look it was like blending a way of super
patchy it just I don't know what it was
about this formula that it just it did
not work at all I definitely do not
recommend this one if you're looking for
a really good black eyeshadow from the
drugstore I recommend what a wilds
Panther it's amazing then we have Bella
pink if you like pink eye shadows oh my
god pick up Bella pink it is super super
pigmented and it goes on the lid
beautifully it has like that purple
undertone so it's super it's just
gorgeous gorgeous all over the lid
especially
if you're into pink eyeshadows and this
is a shimmer finish then we have a Bella
Rose it is a more pinkier kind of pink
the other one had a little bit more
purple in it this one does too but it's
a little bit more like shimmery this is
a shimmer slash highlighter shade so
it's going to be really intense this one
you do have to build it up but once you
do it's a really nice color then we have
a Bella fuchsia it's so gorgeous it is
like a pinky purple a beautiful fuchsia
it does come off a little bit softer on
the lid um but I actually like that
I just buffed this out into my crease
around the outer corners or underneath
my lash line and it gives a nice soft
fuchsia look then we have my all-time
favorite one out of all of them and it
is Bella Rouge and it is a metallic
finish and this is what it looks like
this color is gorgeous and what I love
most about this one is that it goes on
incredibly pigmented on the lid like oh
Lord
super pigmented it reminds me a lot of
Mac's cranberry eyeshadow and this is $4
so I definitely recommend this if your
going to pick up one of them pick up
this one if you're into color like this
of course if you're into that cranberry
look this would be the perfect eye
shadow for fall and we have a Bella
violet is a shimmer shade this is the
color I have on the inner corners of my
eyes it's a really pretty iridescent
kind of color so it's purple but it has
like that glow to it it is really really
pretty
then there's Bella purple and this one
is okay it is really really pretty on
the in the pan but on the lid it was
kind of hard to work with I have it all
over my lid and I had to use my finger
to apply this because with a brush I
wasn't getting any pigment really but
once you do build it up it is a nice
purple color so it is nice if you're
into purple you just have to be aware
that you have to use your finger then we
have Bella silver it's just a beautiful
silver color this is what it looks like
it's a nice silver actually and this is
also one of those colors that you have
to build up on the lid but it's a
typical pretty solar then we have Bella
gray I like this one a little bit more
than Bella silver hand it is a little
bit prettier it does have a little bit
more charcoal to it than the silver
one does but it's a nice nice gray color
and it is a satin matte finish then we
have a bollock charcoal this color is so
gorgeous another one of my favorites
it's just like a rusted gray charcoal
blackish kind of color it's nice and
it's deep perfect for the outer v it's
really really pretty I recommend this
one a lot if you're into those grades
and those dark colors this is a good one
then we have a Bella sky and it is a
nice baby blue color it is it has like a
soft pigment to it it's not superb and
pigmented but it's just a nice soft baby
blue color oh you have Bella teal this
is another one of my favorites probably
talk to it is a gorgeous mermaid tail
color if you're into these really pretty
mermaid colors this one's a great one I
have this smudged underneath my lower
lash line today and it is a metallic
finish it's a really really good teal
color if you are interested in a nice
teal it is definitely this one super
pigmented then we have Bella cobalt it
is a nice cobalt blue this is a satin
matte finish but it does have a little
bit of a glow to it actually is really
really gorgeous then we have Bella Navy
I really like this one as well this
would look super beautiful with a blue
base like a really intense blue base you
would see a lot of the blue in this
eyeshadow you do have to build this one
up quite a bit because it does look a
little bit dark before it starts to look
blue if that makes any sense but once
you build it up like I said gorgeous and
then the last two are green shades this
one is Bella emerald and it is a nice
emerald color if you are into green eye
shadows Bella emerald is your girl and
is a shimmer finish and it is gorgeous
and then last but not least we have
Bella khaki these really kind of green
eye shadows I tend to go for the golden
kind of green if you know what I mean
and this one is stunning the pigment on
this one is
it's really gorgeous on the list well
especially with some gold eyeshadow some
Brown this would look so beautiful hey
guys so those were all the 30 eyeshadows
that just released from Milani I think
that out of the bunch there are some
that really stand out and are comparable
to high-end and are really really
amazing but some of them are not my
favorite they do retail for 399 so they
are really really inexpensive
considering you know you pay like 16
dollars for an eyeshadow at Mac they are
really cheap don't get me wrong like I
said a lot of these are really really
good I'm gonna give you my top 10
favorite ones out of the bunch and I
think they are worth every penny and I
think they are amazing but I will say a
couple of things the ones that aren't my
favorite aren't crap either you just
have to work with them you have to put a
little bit more time into your eyeshadow
look I recommend using your finger with
all of these eyeshadows I feel like they
apply best with your finger the crease
colors do apply beautifully with a big
fluffy crease brush I didn't use any of
my fingers in my crease shade today and
they applied beautifully some of these
don't need to use your finger they go on
amazingly with a brush but if you want
the most pigment I would definitely
recommend using your finger also you
could use these eyeshadows wet and I
definitely recommend using them with
fix+ with fix+ all of them are amazing
they all go on
super super pigmented and super amazing
so if you do have fix+ at home then I
recommend all 30 of these eyeshadows if
you're someone that doesn't want to go
through the trouble of spring fix plus
on your brush and then applying
eyeshadow then I'm going to give you my
top favorite ones I recommend Bella
white because it's just a beautiful
standard white color perfect for the
brow bone inner inner inner color inner
this I recommend by the viola it is a
beautiful iridescent violet shade Bella
cafe and Bella cappuccino are going to
be your perfect crease colors I
definitely recommend these even just as
eyeshadows on their own
amazing and they're beautiful and they
go on amazingly well you are into fun
colors I recommend by the cobalt Bella
pink this one is gorgeous and Bella teal
this one is out of this world beautiful
if you're into fun looks especially in
the summer
Bella teal is your guy I also love Bella
khaki it's a beautiful army green shade
goes on beautifully and for my top three
I am obsessed with Bella bronze you
don't need any fix plus this one goes on
amazingly by the Mandarin this is such a
gorgeous gorgeous color and then Bella
Rouge I said go run to CVS right now and
only get two of them I would recommend
these too if these are the type of
eyeshadows like the colors you wear a
lot these are so fantastic so yeah those
are the ones I recommend the most out of
all of them some of them weren't so
great but nothing a little bit of fix+
and your finger can't help so yeah I
definitely recommend these especially
the 11 that I just showed you they're
399 and I think that they're great
drugstore products so that is the end of
this video thank you guys so much for
