I
you
hey guys welcome back to lips watch week
today's video is all about the other
statement moisture matte lipsticks from
Milani and pretty sure that is the name
they came out with eight new lipsticks
to their color statement line that are
completely matte they have a bunch of
regular color statement lipsticks which
I'm a big fan of I featured them in my
yearly favorites video I love Milani
color statement lipsticks so when I
found out they were coming out with Mac
versions I was head over heels I've
purchased all my original color
statement lipsticks on my own but they
did sent me there a little matte
collection and it's definitely hit or
miss for the most part I really really
love them there are a couple colors that
I'm like iffy about but if you want to
hear like the basics they are very
similar to the Maybelline creamy matte
lipsticks at the drugstore that are my
favorite drugstore lipsticks right now
but I think the maybelline ones are a
little bit better they go on a little
bit more pigmented I don't know if you
could tell like in the lip swatches and
stuff but in the tube it looks a little
bit darker than what it comes off on
your lips like when I applied it to my
lips it does apply the color a little
bit softer which doesn't bother me it's
just not as pigmented as it looks in the
tube not that these aren't pigmented but
this is a lipstick that you're gonna
have to build up especially with the
lighter shades like when I was swatching
them you have to go back and forth like
a bajillion times to get the full color
and that's the same thing on your lips
you're gonna have to pass your lipstick
quite a few times to get that full on
color so just keep that in mind these
are very moisturizing though just like
the name says not like moisturizing lip
gloss but they do not dry out the lips
at all they feel very very velvety like
like I said very similar to the
Maybelline ones I don't feel like they
dry out my lips the
don't wear as long as my labeling ones I
think I do get a few hours out of it but
this is something that you're going to
want to throw in your purse because
you're gonna want to retouch throughout
the day maybe like twice throughout the
day not a lot because it isn't glossy it
will last a little bit longer than like
a glossy product but it's not this the
longest matte lipstick if you don't I
mean does that make sense it does start
to wear off a little bit towards the
inside of your mouth when you're eating
drinking and all that stuff I don't find
that I absolutely need a lip liner when
I use this because I don't think they
feather at least not on me they don't
bleed on my lips they don't get all
weird the only two colors that I'm kind
of iffy about are actually these two
right here matte innocence and matte
glam matte innocence is such a beautiful
color but it really just accentuates all
the creepy little lines on my lips like
they get right up in there and it's
super patchy like this one is not my
favorite which sucks because the color
is beautiful and this one doesn't
accentuate my lines like this one does
but it's also pretty patchy matte glam
which sucks because it's a beautiful
purple but it comes off softer on the
lips and it kind of just looks like
there are spots of my lips showing
through it's a little patchy not my
favorite but the other ones I really
love matte confident is beautiful and I
really love matte naked as well overall
I give these guys a B because they're
super inexpensive on the website they
are five dollars on their Milani website
and they're very creamy they don't have
a nasty scent oh that's another thing
the original color statement lipsticks
smell like watermelon Jolly Ranchers
which I loved but this has a very very
faint scent of nothing like it smells a
little bit vanilla E but it's very very
faint so if you're sensitive to scent
and you hated the original ones because
they smelled like Jolly Ranchers these
don't have like a repulsive scent at all
so besides the fact that a couple of
them are a little patchy and you really
have to build up the color these are
pretty good actually really really liked
them a lot
actually besides those two little cons
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
