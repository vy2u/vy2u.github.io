like a chatty get ready I haven't done
one of these in a little while so I'm
doing that for you today the videos
going up this week on Wednesday and
Friday were pre-recorded from when
before I got my wisdom teeth extracted
because I pre-recorded a lot before my
surgery just so that I had content going
up but I'm feeling feeling feeling a
little bit better today I went to
Walgreens yesterday because I woke up
and my teeth weren't killing me for the
first time since I got them removed and
I decided to just go walk around
Walgreens and I purchased a couple of
things so this is gonna be like a mini
drugstore haul as well I'm gonna show
you what I bought but then I'm going to
apply them on my face that's why I don't
have makeup on just my eyebrows and then
I'm gonna wear it throughout the day and
then I will come back at the end of the
night and give you like my first
impressions of everything because I
haven't tried anything because I just
got it obviously I'm still a little bit
swollen on this side of my mouth but
nothing too bad I mean it's still really
ugly on the inside of my mouth but I'm
not in so much pain so I'm gonna film
okay so let me show you what I go I
picked up the new maybelline superstay
better skin skin transforming foundation
actually did not want to get this like I
saw the packaging and it did not
intrigued me at all even though it does
have a pump I was like I really hated
the original superstay because it felt
like cake on my face but I'm gonna give
this one a shot I have mine in 20
classic ivory and it looks super dark
and since when is classic ivory this
dark like I feel like the foundations
run pretty dark out then I got the
matching concealer just to test both of
these out I have mine and 10 ivory for
underneath my eyes and I hope this isn't
too dark so when I saw that L'Oreal came
out with nutria much Lou me like
illuminators I got really excited they
have three liquid illuminators and then
three powder illuminators I got two of
them I got golden and I got
Rose they have another one called ice I
believe which is like a very pearly
pinky color and I typically really like
those colors as primers or like to mix
in but I have the bodyshop one and I
find it so similar and then I have this
this is the light infusing primer from
L'Oreal Lumi and I feel like this has
that pearly color to it so I didn't want
to get the ice one I felt it was I don't
know I thought I had so many things that
already looked like it so yes I got rose
and golden I don't know what I'm going
to use today we'll see I haven't even
swatched any of this and then I got the
tremolo me powder glow illuminator blush
and highlight these is just highlights
and I got mine in rose and golden to
match the illuminator the powder looks
really pretty in the ice one but these
are the 11 dollars each they're not like
sheep you know and then I saw this on
display and I'm pretty sure this is
brand new I haven't seen anybody talking
about it eaten though this is the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin blush it was on
a new display and it says new so and I
got mine in 10 rosy I wanted to try it
on today and see if it lasts throughout
the day and how it looks and then I
didn't show this in my picture on
Instagram when I showed you guys this
stuff but I got the voluminous miss
manga Rach mascara I got this a few
weeks ago but I decided to throw it in
today because I haven't used it yet so
I'm going to use it in today's video I
hated the original miss manga because of
the wand the one was so bendy that it
didn't really coat my lashes the way I
wanted it to so I'm gonna try this out
yeah that was my little mini haul I also
bought an Essie nail polish but stepping
on my coffee okay so I'm gonna go ahead
and get started on this stuff I don't
want to mention something really quick I
purchased this a few weeks ago or like a
week and a half ago this is the
covergirl outlast all-day primer makeup
wear extender I purchased this because
if you guys saw my review I have been
really really really loving the stay
luminous foundation so I thought I'm
going to give the prime
shop I hate this I had to take it off my
face the second I put it on it looks and
feels like a moisturizer when you
squeeze this out but as I was applying
it to my face
it turned into little balls like a
little bumpy I don't know it just balled
up on my skin and I don't know if it's
because I have dry skin but it just it
was awful it turned like into rough it
was gross I had to take it off
immediately and then I tried it again a
different day and did the same thing so
no no I don't like these I'm never gonna
use that ever again
okay so I'm going to start off by
priming my face like I normally would
I'm gonna use my holy grail of all-time
favorite primer the hangover RX or
hangover X I don't exactly know the
right way to say that now I'm going to
go in with the foundation and I hope
this foundation matches me because there
weren't any testers like there were
testers when I tried out the luminous
one from covergirl but we shall see we
shall see I'm a little nervous I really
don't think this is my color but the one
before this was too pink
and then the one before that was the
lightest one it was porcelain and it was
like super super light so let's see oh
maybe maybe
okay so it smells like a regular
foundation nothing obnoxious
it looked like it was clinging onto the
sides of my nose but we shall zoom in in
a second and see okay so the color seems
to be okay but I mean for me just
winging it I think I printed a pretty
decent job okay so my initial first
impression it kind of clung to my dry
patches just a little bit especially
around my nose and in between my
forehead that's where I get the most
dryness I'm gonna zoom you in I don't
know if you can tell it looks a little
just a little off like you kind of see
it just sitting on the skin see what I
mean I don't know if you can tell man
the camera really isn't picking it up
but it just looks a little flaky and
like it didn't blend into the skin I
don't know if you guys know what I mean
but I could see it that's one kind of
site I could see it definitely here in
this area on the rest of my face it
looks pretty good it doesn't feel super
tacky okay so I'm going to bust up in
this bad boy this is the better skin
concealer corrector targets dark circles
spots imperfections by the way the idea
behind this foundation is it's supposed
to transform your skin over time the
more you use it so hopefully that's an
indication I don't really don't believe
that but hopefully that's an indication
like hey I'm not going to break you out
so maybe it's good percent for the skin
it gives you like a matte finish like a
Demi matte finish
not 100% matte but not luminous so I
have my concealer in the shade ivory I'm
just going to apply this underneath my
eyes I love that it's in a wand oh I
thought this was going to be too dark
but no no it is not
I'm not going to apply concealer right
here like I normally would or around my
nose I can normally would because I want
to see how that foundation acts in that
area throughout the day I'm just going
to blend that in with a zoeva silk
finish brush
I'm going to apply that on my eyes to
like you know Prime's in so I'm not
going to use a primer cannot doing any
eyeshadow honestly by the way guys I
used the elf brow pencil for my eyebrows
in this video and I have been using it a
lot like on days where I'm not really
wearing makeup and I kind of like it
it's like a few dollars I don't like it
as much as the NYX one um the next one
that's a little bit more waxy and this
one is a little bit more creamy but it's
a really good brow pencil it has the
spoolie on the end and everything and I
really like it elf has been stepping up
their game let me tell you okay so I do
notice that this concealer does not have
very full coverage the coverage is like
decent it's not super super flow or
anything I'm going to set this with my
Maybelline powder and creamy natural if
you like that the concealers didn't
really crease all that much like the
second I applied it some concealer is
really crease up under there the
concealer is pretty good I would have
liked it to have a little bit more
coverage but on days where it feels
really light on days where I'm just like
I could throw this on I actually really
like the concealer a lot more than the
foundation the foundation is just
sitting on my skin right now and I can
see it the camera really wasn't picking
it up but like I could see it like
crusting on my dry my super dry patches
and I have very dry skin at the moment
so I'm going to apply one of these
illuminators right now underneath the
powder if you like doing one on one time
one on the other but I don't want to
look crazy for the rest of the day I'm
going to swatch them just so you guys
can see because I haven't even swatch
them ooh that golden one is super gold
holy crap these are pigmented so as you
can see these are very very pigmented
I'm going to take the shade golden and
I'm going to apply this to my cheekbones
this golden one is really really pretty
really pretty but you do have to work
really fast because it kind of dries
very quickly and then it sets so you
could potentially have like a line like
a stark line of highlight holy crap they
dry so fast that could be either a good
thing or a bad thing for some people
this one is very pigmented if you are
super fair you will be able to see it it
won't really blend into the skin because
it is so pigmented really gorgeous I
just don't like how fast it dries but
it's really pretty I want to try it as a
primer and mixed in with my foundation
because I really think I might like it
that way I'm going to bronze up my skin
a little bit using this Laura Mercier
matte radiance baked powder in bronze
zero three I got this as a point perk
from Sephora like a 500-point perk it
came with a bunch of things they still
have it right now and I highly recommend
it because comes with a bunch of stuff
and this is a very warm bronzer so I'm
just gonna just warm up the cheeks this
is a Sephora pro brush and forty number
40
just gonna add a little bit on my neck
just to just little things match up you
know you know now I'm going to take I'm
going to swatch these for you really
quickly but I'm going to use the golden
one just because I'm using the golden
highlight you know I'm slant so
everything matches let me open these I
haven't even swatch these I'm really
excited I have high hopes for these I
hope they're very pigmented and
beautiful and like in this highlight
it's very pigmented though if I was a
little bit more fair you would see like
a gold line on my face I do not
recommend that color for super super
fair-skinned but that would leave really
pretty one I like freshly tan I got this
opened okay so this one is rose so it
has like a mirror on the inside and then
a brush or it's a little powdery but
when you blend it out you do get really
pretty color wow this is very light I
don't see much of the rosiness to this
at all unless I stay away from like that
big white section and even then I don't
find it very rosy it's not as deep as
this so that could either be a good
thing or a bad thing I'm not super super
impressed by the color of this let me
open the gold one I have higher
expectations for this one okay so this
is what the golden one looks like on the
inside these colors are beautiful let's
just swatch them all together
Oh
I mean it's really pretty once you build
up the color and yeah but it's not so
amazing I find that the elf baked
highlighter in pink tastic Wells me so
much more than this and it's so much
cheaper but I am going to use this one
on my cheeks right now so let's see it's
like powder Reid you know I mean like
you put your brush in and like powder
goes everywhere
okay so it looks so gorgeous on camera
right now like I'm looking at myself and
I'm like holy crap you are super super
highlighted and super beautiful but I'm
gonna bring you in let me show you can
you see how it just kind of accentuates
my dry skin a little bit I don't know
how to explain it I could just see it
let me see if I cover I could see it
sitting on my skin and it kind of
accentuates it accentuates my dry skin I
don't know how to explain it okay so I
really don't want to sound negative well
I just got it all over my face okay oh
my god I got glitter all over my mouth
there's glitter everywhere okay this is
kind of glittery okay I hate doing first
impressions because I hate to sound
negative oh my god so much glitter this
is like a glitter fart on your face do
not put too much on because it is
glittery like looking at myself and I'm
like wow that looks so beautiful but if
you see me in person and you look up
close its accentuating like my skin
underneath what I'm trying to say is
from far it is beautiful but up close
not so much it's a little powdery a
little chunky not very smooth it doesn't
make the skin look nice it's definitely
one of those highlighters you know how
some highlights just accentuate the skin
these do that and just being honest guys
please don't hate me but it just looks
so good on camera right yeah no not in
person
I like glitter so much glitter I'm gonna
try this
Neutrogena healthy skin and blush I have
high hopes for this this is what the
color is a really pretty peachy color
I'm going to use my cosmetics blush
brush tap off dang swings maybe I should
put on my blush before my highlight but
you know what what a pretty color
this color is really beautiful I'm
really into it so I'm going to apply my
mascara and then a lip product and then
I'll be done
I'm going to try out this mascara for
the very first time right now I'm very
excited the brush isn't as bendy as I
remember the other one being so let's
hope this is supposed to be like a
spider II lash effect so I'm going to
assume it's going to be a little clumpy
which I'm okay with long as it looks a
little volumizing I don't mind okay
right off the bat I like it so much more
than the original because I can comb
through my lashes and the wand isn't
like I really hated the wand on the last
one I loved the formula but the one was
just driving me nuts okay so this was
the mascara looks like with two coats I
shouldn't have done two coats I should
have kept it at one coat because it's
looking little clumps my gums you know
what I mean but I like it
I like it so I'm just gonna do this eye
and I will be right back okay so as you
can see like this made my lashes super
intense they are a little spidery but
that is what it's supposed to look like
it's like the barak mascara I gotta say
I like it so much more than the original
you do have to be a little bit careful
because it is a clumpy mascara so just
do one coat and you should be okay I
love the ones I love I'm into it I'm
into it I'm just gonna hit my lips with
soap and glory a great kisser because my
lips are so disgusting okay so I really
like the look so far I will get back to
you at the end of the night and give you
my final thoughts on everything okay
wait
I just took pictures I just finished I
just finished I just took pictures on my
iPhone which the camera quality kind of
sucks but I just took pictures like a
macro shot of this area and obviously
people are not going to be this close to
your face so it doesn't really matter
but I just want to show you how badly
the highlighter accentuate
my pores and like my skin and do you see
how the glitter is like all over the
side of my nose um and it just makes my
pores look so large and my skin just
looks a little rough anyway I'll give
you my final thoughts at the end of the
night like I've already said but for
real this time
hey guys um I changed my shirt because I
didn't want to wear that other shirt to
Publix I don't know why but it's
currently 905 I started filming the
video earlier today around 2 o'clock so
it's been almost 7 hours ok so let's do
a rundown of what's happening on my face
it kind of looks like this foundation
got a little bit dewy or oily but it
didn't it's the highlight that has made
its way down to my face I know that
sounds super weird but like glitter has
like fallen onto my face around here and
it's created this like do we affect from
far but close it's like glittery I'm
actually pretty impressed with the
foundation I didn't think I was going to
be but I'm pretty impressed it hasn't
broken up it has invaded it has stayed
the same it stayed exactly the same as
it did when I apply it so really I mean
that's pretty good I think people are
really gonna like that I just personally
don't like how it's sat on my skin but
actually the longer I wore it I mean the
more okay I was with it but for my skin
type it's not the worst foundation I've
ever turned on honestly it's not bad
it's not bad it's just not amazing so
this is alright for me this is a big fat
fail in my opinion like I do not like
this highlight whatsoever like I said
earlier this yellowy portion is super
chunky and it doesn't even look like it
is in the pan but it's just super
glittery it accentuated my pores you saw
in that picture I showed you and that is
the only thing I really didn't like I
actually really really really liked the
liquid version of the illuminator is set
really nicely I made my skin glowy it
dried a little fast which I didn't like
how fast it dry but it didn't stay tacky
which is nice it does dry down I love
this blush this new
a healthy skin blush I don't know if you
can tell but it's been seven hours and
it's still on my face the blush is still
going strong on my face and it could be
this foundation it could be that it's
really the foundation has like coming to
the blush and it's lasted a good time
but I love the color I really like this
I might pick up some more that's a
thumbs up for me this is a thumbs up and
a thumbs down only because it did smudge
here I don't know if you could tell
right here which means that it's not
great for my lower lash line it does
smudge a little bit underneath my eyes
here that is the only thing that I don't
like but I love how it looks on my top
lashes so I'm gonna continue to use this
this is a thumbs up for me but I won't
use it anymore on my bottom lashes and I
also really liked the superstay better
skin concealer it was lightweight it
wasn't tacky it didn't cling to my
dryness and it did increase as much as I
thought it was so this one's really nice
it doesn't have full full coverage but
it's nice for like everyday wear so this
is a thumbs up for me too
it's not like amazing but it's good so
yeah that completes this video I hope
