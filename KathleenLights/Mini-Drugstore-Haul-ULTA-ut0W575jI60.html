dressed for a Christmas Eve party but
I'm going out with my husband
very so that's why I had like makeup on
I don't sit at home it's like full-blown
makeup on I'm going somewhere okay also
second sorry I guess I'm filming in
front of my mirror as opposed to like in
front of the window where I usually film
or I've been filming the last two videos
I usually film because it is 7:51 and
there's no Sun out so you wouldn't be
able to see me anyway
I went to Ulta today because there's 40
percent off of Revlon Physicians Formula
all May and NYX and like Maybelline has
like I wouldn't get one finishing off I
think on some of their stuff I don't
know if I could like sale at palta this
whole week so I went and I got some
stuff I didn't get a whole lot but I
mean you got some step by the way I've
saved
$15.40 40% off so I'm going to start off
by showing you the things that weren't
40 percent off that I kind of bought so
the first thing I got were these Burt's
Bees sensitive facial cleansing
towelettes and after trial and error I
have decided that these are the best
makeup remover wipes for me that I've
ever used all of them burn my face off
like literally I'm done taking my makeup
off and there's on my face looks like a
tomato like every day off sting my face
and I bought these before and I loved
them I love them they don't they're for
sensitive skin and they're amazing I
don't know why I stopped buying them
maybe I should try something else but no
I am now on and will not buy anything
else besides it took fact 30 of them I
love this it's awesome
so I also picked up a nail polish that
I've had my eye on for like a year it's
the Sally Hansen extreme wear nail
polishes and coral reef look at this
yeah this is what it looks like it's
such a pretty color I love this it's
like the perfect pink or suffering I
love this it's not what's on my nails by
the way but this color is so cute I love
this okay and the next thing I picked up
I've been super super wanting to try and
it's the batiste dry shampoo um this is
just the cherry one I love cherry
scented stuff so I picked up the cherry
one umm I've hated dry shampoo in the
past the dove one I don't like it I
don't know I feel like all the dry
shampoos I've tried haven't read many
but all the time shampoo is actually
don't do anything to my hair so I hope
this is as good as everybody present him
okay I also picked up the one of the
Maybelline Color tattoos this is our to
open pomegranate Punk which I'm sure
you've all seen before it's like a
purple cranberry color I don't know I've
been wanting this for so long and every
time I go to Target its sold out so I
figured I'd pick it up it was buy one
get one 50% off and I'm dumb I didn't
get another one but bad to the bronze
was sold out and I've been wanting that
one too and the other ones weren't
really calling out to me the next thing
I got I'm so mad that I got because I
got home and I realized this sucked
it's the NYX jumbo lip pencil it's like
it click on like a crayon for your lips
and honestly I didn't realize how dumb
this was when I got home I mean it
swatches beautifully it's like this
pinky like the nicest pink and it's so
creamy and soft but it smells horrible
smells like wax like smells so bad and
also check this out
it broke watch this
yeah and not only that this doesn't
retract or anything so this is the
entire product you got like this is all
you get this little nubbin or whatever
this is so yeah this was a huge bummer
but I mean I was like four dollars
originally and it was 40% off so it was
like two something still stung a little
bit I got it right I got a lot of lip
products on a lot of the products but
everything I had ever since I got my
covergirl lip perfection jumbo gloss
balm I've been obsessed with this and
I'm not one that really likes like
drugstore lipsticks because I never
liked the smell but they've been coming
out with like a lot of really good like
drugstore lip products and I like month
long so I was so obsessed with that that
I wanted to pick up the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stains because that
is good but it doesn't mask as long and
this is like a stage so I wanted to get
it and it picked up like the ones that I
thought really cute for spring this one
is in darling yeah darling and it's so
cute it's like the nicest like glossy
purple it's so cute and then I got this
one is in charm a lot of people don't
like this one but I am such a peach
where that I have to
well you can't see it that well but it's
like it gives a nice little peachy
peachy gloss to the lips I love these
things well so far I love these things
I don't really worn them I don't know
how great they stained but you know nice
I also picked up one of these NYX love
in Paris palettes I don't know if
they're new I think they're new I don't
know but this is the one that calls out
to me the most it's the Parisian chic
and I love these colors and I really
drew me into this one as opposed to all
the other ones was this super cute tilty
shade right here it's like a champagne e
taupe gray I don't know if you can tell
we can see that but it's really good
because it has like format one I have a
highlighter shade in Lisbon scoffing
like I said it has a highlighter shade
it has a dark outer crease color house a
taupe and has Browns it's like super
versatile think I'm going to do a
tutorial using this I really like that
and then the last thing I got um I had
originally wanted the NYX butter glosses
I don't know if they're know but when I
went there was not one left I mean it
was like all sold out all of them gone
so I picked up the soft matte lip creams
and I love matte lipstick like that's my
thing so I think I would really like
this and this smells so good it smells
exactly like vanilla like a vanilla like
a plug-in like that you put in the wall
like you're and then your house smells
like it should make any sense this is
exactly what it smells like I'm
surprised like I am super surprised it's
smells awesome and this is the nicest
color this is one shade and I'm gonna
add it abba-abba-abba that is a bun no
no but it's like hopping it's like hot
pink Oh pink I love bright lipsticks
my husband's just coming up coughing up
a storm over there I need some theraflu
so anyway that's everything I got a lot
of the things that I wanted were sold
out um like people rated the crap out of
the NICS section at Ulta
so I mean I didn't have a lot to choose
from and I mean I can get Revlon at
Walgreens so I was really interested in
getting next stuff and I only think that
like three next things but you know
whatever
ah how are you I would pass on these
things if you're wondering if they're
good no so yeah that's it um thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe

video bye guys okay

this is not the cutest thing you've ever
seen I judge you Cornelia's judges you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
