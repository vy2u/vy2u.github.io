in the morning for me and I just got
down I'm about to put on some makeup and
today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you my minimal out the door
everyday makeup it's really fast and it
takes no effort to do and today's video
is actually sponsored by NARS I'm going
to be sharing their newest concealer
with you guys this is the NARS soft
matte complete concealer it's their
brand new full coverage concealer that
has a really soft matte finish when I
first got these in the mail I wanted to
make sure that I played around with them
for about a week or so to see if I
really truly loved them and I do these
concealers are very good when I hear the
word matte that usually really scares me
because I have dry skin but this has
such a natural soft matte look that it
doesn't look cakey and it doesn't
highlight any of my dry skin at all top
concealers like this are awesome to
cover up blemishes but because the
formula it's also really nice underneath
the eye so I can use this on my entire
face which I love you guys know one of
my Holy Grail concealers is the NARS
radiant creamy I've been using that for
years it's been in so many of my videos
it's been a huge favorite of mine and I
was also so impressed with these NARS
justice concealers really really well my
favorite shade and the one I use all the
time is the shade vanilla light too I
also use the vanilla shade in the NARS
radiant creamy I love this tone it's not
too yellow but it's not too pink either
I love this shade when my skin tone is a
little bit deeper when I have a self-tan
on or like in the summer I will most
likely be using the shade custard I also
use custard in the radiant creamy in the
summer time I also really like to shade
light one chantilly I've used this one a
couple of times too it's just very very
fair but it is a bit more yellow than
the shade light you can see the
difference that light just has a little
bit more of a pinky tone which I prefer
but if you don't gently is definitely
for you oh yeah anyway let's jump into
this minimal really fast every day a
makeup look okay so I'm going to start
by filling in my eyebrows I always fill
in my eyebrows no matter what makeup
look I'm going to do even if it's
literally all I do and the brow pencil
I'll be using today is the LA girl shady
slim brow pencil in the shade medium
brown I really like this one I find it
easy to use and it
what it needs to do you know if those in
my brows and makes them look a little
bit more full and then I'll just take my
spoolie and I'll start to brush my
eyebrows up because I love the feathery
brow look once I brush them up I kind of
see where I'm missing like you know
where I have like some bald spots and
then I'll fill those in I quite like the
look of messy brows so that's what I'm
doing kind of so whenever I do I make it
like this it's usually because I have to
go somewhere or have to be somewhere all
day and I want to make sure that my
makeup even though it's minimal it's
going to stay on all days so I am going
to set my brows I'm going to use the
Loreal brow stylist plumper in the shade
light to medium this really really keeps
your brow hairs in place I'm just
brushing them up so they have that
feathery look and then I'm just going to
kind of brush them a little bit down so
they don't look too crazy I personally
do not like to wear foundation on the
everyday basis so I'm just sticking with
concealer today but even though I'm not
going to put on a foundation I am going
to prime my skin I'm going to use the
amani perfect-10 primer serum and I like
to do this because first of all it gives
moisture to my skin and I have dry skin
but also it's going to prime my skin for
the concealer that I'm about to put down
primer doesn't only help your foundation
last all day it helps all the other
makeup you put on your skin lasts all
day I'm just going to work this into my
skin if you are going to be going on
into the Sun you want to make sure to
put on some SPF I did put on some SPF
before I start down to film this video
so like I said earlier that concealer
I'm gonna be using today is the NARS
soft matte complete concealer I'm going
to take the shade of light to vanilla
and I'm going to use my finger to apply
this make sure your hands are clean
before you do this you can totally use a
brush and apply it that way but I like
to use my fingers because I feel like
the warmth of my fingers really just
blend this product into the skin you
barely have to tap into this and so much
comes off but it's not cakey it just
gives you such like amazing coverage
so I'm just going to blend that in and
I'm going to focus this mainly right
here where my dark circles are because
Mama's got some dark circles but I'm
also bringing this right into here
because I have a lot of darkness in here
as well I'm also going to take that onto
my eyelids because I have a lot of veins
on my eyelids so I want to make sure
that it just covers them up I look a
little less like a vampire what I
actually really love about this
concealer is the fact that it's a pop
concealer but it's not super cakey but
it's also not an extremely do we either
it's not going to make your skin look
wet or shiny I'm bringing this down here
because I do have a lot of redness here
so I'm just covering that up taking it
onto my cheeks a little bit and onto my
nose I'm also going to take this
concealer on other places of my face
where I feel like it needs a little bit
of coverage I have a birthmark in
between my eyebrows I'm just going to
pop that on and on my chin
okay so that's all the coverage I will
be putting on my face I am going to go
ahead and set my face I'm going to apply
some powder this concealer doesn't
really crease that bad I mean it does
crease a little bit but honestly I can
go without setting it because it's not
too dewy and it is increased so bad so
that's also a really good thing but
because I am going to be wearing this
makeup for the rest of the day and it is
early in the morning I do want a powder
just to make sure that everything is
nice and set but before I do that I do
want to apply another cream product to
my face I'm going to take the Wet n Wild
mega cushion highlight in the shade
who's that pearl it looks pink in the
cushion but it comes up a little bit
more pearl I'm just going to pop that on
my cheek so it can give me a really
natural glow without going too
over-the-top since we don't have that
much makeup on I don't want to look like
extremely highlighted to set my face I'm
going to use the elf finishing powder in
the shade fair light I'm going to use
this to set my under eye concealer so
I'm just going to take that powder and
I'm going to just set everywhere I put
concealer literally pretty much my whole
face this is just going to lock back and
see there in place for the entire day so
you can see that even though we set down
our makeup there's still a little bit of
glow coming from the areas where I put
the wet and wild highlighter like very
minimal but that's what I wanted for the
eyes I always do the bare minimum when
I'm going to rush as long as they're
conceals I really don't care to put that
much product on them when I'm on the go
so I'm just going to pop on some mascara
I'm going to use the Elizabeth Mott it's
so big volumizing mascara I really like
this mascara it doesn't smudge or get
all over my face which is nice you might
want to curl your lashes before this
step especially if you're planning on
wearing this throughout the entire day
but most of the time I'm usually okay
with just skipping the lash curler okay
so now all I have left to do is just
finish up my face and to do my lip color
my face is just really easy every time I
do
like this I always eliminate blush just
because I don't know I rather calm
bronzer than pound blush so I'm going to
take my NARS Laguna bronzer and the only
reason I put on bronzer anyway is just
to give my skin a little bit more color
because when all you do is apply
concealer you look a little washed out
so I'm going to take my Laguna bronzer
and I'm just going to warm up the skin
now obviously when you apply a bronzer
to your face when there hasn't been any
foundation on it it doesn't apply as
pigmented or as smoothly as it would so
you might have to blend a little bit
more but it's okay I don't mind that
because I just think it looks really
natural and I like that you can see my
skin peeking through the bronzer and
that it doesn't look so perfect a lot of
the times when I do this look I go for
this bronzer or any other bronzer with a
sheen to it because it does give your
skin a nice healthy glow I wouldn't go
in with like a contour powder for this I
definitely use something that's just
going to warm up the skin and make you
look healthy and I'm just going to blend
everything out with a stippling brush I
do like to bring this bronzer onto the
cheeks a little bit since we didn't
apply blush it's just going to give a
little bit of warmth to the cheek I'm
going to add a little bit of a highlight
to my cheek even though I feel like my
face has a natural highlight to it like
very natural you can't really tell I'm
going to add a little bit more of a glow
I'm going to take my pixie glowy powder
in santorini sunset and I'm going to
apply a little bit of this color right
to the tops of my cheekbones not too
much just a little bit then I'm just
going to take a little bit onto the nose
I'm also going to add a little bit of
this powder to my inner corners just to
bring some light right here and just a
little bit to the brow bone I'm going to
take some of my brow bone just a little
bit now this next out is very important
so that your makeup will last the entire
day you're going to want to set it down
with a setting spray this is the Milani
make it left setting spray okay so
finally for lips I usually just grab
something that's going to last all day
like a liquid lipstick or a lip liner or
something like this this is the NARS
Velvet Matte lip pencil in the shade get
off this is a newer color to me but I
have been using the soft matte lip
pencils for years now they are really
good and they last all day on the lip so
I'm going to take the shade get off and
I'm just going to apply this to my lips
but I'm going to do it to where not a
lot of pigmentation comes out I just
want to apply a very soft layer of this
I just want to give my lips a little bit
of color something that's not too crazy
or too bold but it's going to look nice
and feel very lightweight throughout the
day since I'm not applying too much okay
so normally I would just stop right
there
but I want to apply this baby on top
just because it's very hydrating and I
don't mind reapplying this about today
so I'll just throw this in my purse this
is the elf tinted lip oil in the shade
pink kiss I love this it's like an oil
hydrating treatment but feels like a lip
gloss is awesome
okay guys so that completes this video
this is basically the look that I do all
the times when I want to do the bare
minimum but I still want my makeup to
last all day the products change all the
time
this routine stays the same I know I've
uploaded similar videos to this in the
past but I feel like I haven't done a
minimal makeup in a long time and it was
time if I were in high school right now
like this is a look I would do every day
so yeah I think that's all I have to say
that completes this video thank you guys
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
