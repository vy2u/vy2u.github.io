another disappointing products video I
feel like I've been doing these a lot
recently it's almost like I have one
once a month which kind of sucks if you
think about it but I try out so much
makeup and I love the majority of them
but sometimes there are things that I
just don't love things that just don't
work out for me whether it's because it
doesn't go with my skin type or whatever
the case may be some products disappoint
me from time to time and usually when
that happens I always give them away to
a friend cuz most of the time it'll work
for someone else but before I do that I
want to share them with you guys I'm not
gonna give the disclaimer because I've
already filmed like a million of these
videos and you guys understand please
let me know in the comments if this is a
video you guys are enjoying like my
frequent uploads of disappointing
products let me know if it's something
you like because I will definitely
continue to do them besides that let's
get started okay so my first product is
a bronzer and the only reason I'm
talking about this today is because I
was kind of shocked that I didn't like
it this is the Physicians Formula bronze
booster glow boosting season to season
bronzer in light to medium I have a
Physicians Formula bronze booster
bronzer that I love and it's also called
a bronze booster bronzer that is so
weird Physicians Formula needs to work
on these names this is what the bronzer
looks like I bought it because I thought
it was like a perfect mix of light
bronzer and dark you have like winter
spring summer fall this bronzer does not
show up on me at all it's kind of like a
face powder honestly I don't like the
formula it's kind of chunky when I
applied it on my skin so shocked at how
bad it was like it isn't even a bronzer
that just doesn't show up no the formula
I don't like there's like chunks of gold
glitter in this bronzer but yeah not my
favorite just quickly wanted to mention
this because I always rave about
Physicians Formula bronzers I think of a
drugstore they make the best bronzers
butter bronzer amazing their bronze
booster amazing not this one the other
one my next product is also from the
drugstore and I was also kind of shocked
because this is probably my favorite
drugstore brand which is wet and wild I
love the color icon blushes like I love
them I have so many they're all amazing
these I was totes disappointed and these
are the ombre blushes I think these were
exclusive
to target might I buy you a drink and
this one is called in a purple haze I
can still use these and I'll get like a
hint of color but I just find myself
reaching for the other wet and wild
blushes a hundred times over these they
just don't show up on my skin and it's
probably because they're so light they
kind of don't show up in my skintone but
most light blushes do I'm pretty fair I
just didn't like these not only did they
not show up very well but they looked so
powdery on my face like I applied it on
my face and I guess because I had to use
a lot of products for it to show up it
looked like I had powder on my face and
I feel like no other blush has ever done
that for me and on top of that it just
did not last on my face at all like
three hours later I looked in the mirror
and my blush was completely gone so I
really don't recommend these if you're
looking for affordable blushes that are
insanely pigment in it lasts forever
the original color icon blushes are way
better than these so I would totally
skip on these if you see them at Target
okay so a high-end product I was kind of
disappointed in there it's not bad but I
just I don't love them it's the
hourglass ambient like correcting
primers these are their new primers
these were sent to me by hourglass I
don't love these there's something about
this I just don't love these I'm a huge
fan of hourglass primers that's why I
got this in the mail and I was so
excited like their serum primer amazing
for dry skin and their mineral veil
primer is also fabulous like my makeup
lasts all day when I wear that these
just they just did nothing for me the
only one I kind of liked was luminous
light so let me explain it comes in
luminous light mood light and dim light
and what these claim to do it's supposed
to give your face kind of like a very
soft nothing too intense but a very soft
subtle glow but it's supposed to like
blur and smooth out your skin personally
I felt like I was just putting on like a
creamy moisturizer that had like a hint
of Sheen and color but then it
disappeared and then it was like nothing
was there these are $44 that's pricey
for a primer and I just find that they
don't do much it doesn't make my makeup
last longer doesn't make my foundation
look luminous because it's very subtle I
mean if you like subtle luminous primers
maybe you will like luminous light but I
just found there
they're primers out there that do more
like their mineral veil primer is much
better than this I don't want to sound
mean but to me these primers are a
little bit gimmicky
and I'm sorry I freaking love our glass
this so recently I was on the Jessie's
Girl website I loved Jessie's Girl they
make one of my favorite eyeliners and
they recently came out with liquid
lipsticks and I bought all of them
online and while I was on the website I
saw these I don't like these these are
the Jessie's Girl fluid shadows I saw
these on the website and thought they
were so cool kind of like metallic
liquid foiled eyeshadows the first time
I swatch these I was like oh my god I'm
gonna love them they're so good they
kind of like swatch like it's a kind of
like a nail polish applicator the one i
swatched is called destiny and this is
it right here beautiful right like wow
that would look amazing on my eyes when
you go to blend this it disappears and
it gets extremely patchy and of course
you're thinking okay fine just don't
blend it but you have to you apply this
to your lids or to your finger and when
you go to tap it into your eyes like to
blend it out it detaches from the lid
like it starts to stick onto your finger
and then all the pigment just comes off
of your eye so it's almost impossible to
use these I tried I did not like them
even though they are affordable I don't
think they're worth it there are tons of
other brands that make cream eyeshadows
metallic like this that work better okay
let's discuss some lip products I was
recently a little disappointed in this
is the Giorgio Armani lip maestro lip
Mastro in the shade 507 I have three
other colors and I love them I love them
I bought these on Sephora very very
pricey and I do think these are good
they're kind of like liquid lipsticks a
little bit boo seer and more comfortable
to wear this color is awful and looking
at it in the tube I was so excited when
I saw it I was like oh my god you are
mine you look like a beautiful purple
mauve color beautiful no oh my gosh this
wear is so patchy it's like the patches
purple color it looks awful on my lips
it accentuates like every little line or
dryness in my lips don't exactly know
why
all the other ones I have are amazing
and this one sucks but it does and I
wasn't gonna mention this in the video
because I don't think these are bad they
have a good formula but if you do like
these I wanted to try out number 507 I
say don't I say skip it such a waste of
money cuz hello that's expensive and
unfortunately I feel the same way about
this liquid lipstick right here this is
the Anastacio liquid lipstick in the
shade
this looks terrible on me I really do
like the Anastasio liquid lipsticks for
some reason when they first came out I
was not a fan of the formula but now
they're newer colors I really really
really love like Ashton I mean this
color I think it has to do with the fact
that it is a nude in my humble opinion I
don't want to offend anyone in my humble
opinion I don't think I'll associate
those great nude liquid lipsticks like
my dose of colors sand I spoken about it
100 times but sand from dose of colors
is my favorite like super pale nude it
never looks bad
this color naked gets so crusty on the
inside of my mouth that it's almost
impossible to wear because it looks
gross after like an hour I have the same
problem with pure Hollywood by
anastasiya it's something about their
lighter shades that gets so crusty on
the inside of my mouth like it looks
like a ring of white nobody wants that I
don't like that and I think it's only
with me because I see people wear pure
Hollywood all the time naked all the
time the nudes just get so crusty on me
so I'm gonna give this to my sister
because this looks like collected spit
in my mouth two more lip products I was
not a fan of these are the colour-pop
lippie stix and I love colour-pop lippie
stix you guys know this but this is
their Matt X formula this formula is
extremely matte completely different
than their matte lipsticks like their
regular maps these are super super matte
they they have no shine on the lips
which I love these two colors no bueno
my friends this one is in the shade she
bad and I'm so sad that I do not like
this because this color is beautiful
watch watch that is like a perfect nude
this looks so dry on my lips if you even
have the slightest dryness the slightest
dryness to your lips you cannot wear she
bed it will look awful and I know that's
super harsh but I was so excited when I
opened this box and I was like that's my
color
and then I put it on and I didn't really
like it emphasized all the lines it
looked really drying on my lips could be
because I have like chronic dry lips
24/7 I have dry everything dry skin dry
hair dry eyes dry lips I'm dry I'm sure
with those of you who have a really
plump and delicious moisturize lips this
would look really nice but for me it's
just didn't and the same with the shade
topless I actually do love this formula
like the color trust me you guys need it
if you've been looking at the Mattocks
formula from colour-pop trust me and by
trust me it's my favorite shade it's
beautiful this one in topless this is a
very intense neon like a neon coral
orange I don't know if it's because it
is a neon that it looks horrendous on my
lips but it does it looks it looks so
bad even with a lip balm underneath I
just cannot wear this color it looks
like oh honey you got dry lips
girlfriend I feel like I'm sounding so
mean but I just these two colors not a
fan I'm a fan of Maddux just not topless
and Chiba this is super random but I
want to talk about the Sephora contour
matte gel eyeliners these are the
waterproof ones I have this one in the
shade beautiful monster and of the name
of that this is so dry I have another
color in this formula and I just don't
like this formula it is so so drying
that it kind of doesn't apply like the
product is so dry that when I try to
apply it on my waterline it doesn't
stick to my waterline because there's no
creaminess to this and yeah you can say
like well it's waterproof what do you
expect I have a ton of waterproof
eyeliners that glide like a dream there
is no excuse for it to be so crusty
maybe I just got to really dry eyeliners
maybe these are great but personally for
me they were so hard to work with so
tough on the eyes stay far far far away
from these contour matte gel liners
because they're bad so this next product
I totally debated whether or not I
should add it in this video a big part
of me wanted to but then there was a
little voice in the back of my head that
said don't do it but you know what I'm
gonna regret it if I don't do it I'm
gonna talk about these because I don't
like that these are the Pat McGrath
highlights calm down
relax don't get upset let me talk let me
let me talk
these are their skin fetishes and I
bought them both myself it comes in a
set so I mean they're super pricey but
when I went to purchase them I thought
okay it's fine to pay that much because
it comes with a brush and then a
double-ended highlight Plus this these
are seventy two dollars each seven to
seventy two dollars but you get one of
these which is they're like little
pigment you get this and then you get a
double-ended highlighter one comes with
like a bomb and then the other side is a
color which I actually really do like
that I like the double-ended like bomb
and highlight love it I also really love
the brush that comes in this set so you
get this that the one to thing any brush
and it's $72 when I got this in the mail
I was so let down I don't want to take
away from Pat McGrath because she's an
amazing makeup artist and I don't want
to offend her which is why I didn't want
to talk about this but for $72 look at
this packaging this has the same
packaging as my ELF highlight this elf
baked highlighter okay same kind of
packaging and this elf one is like three
books 72 yes it comes with more things
but I just don't think for the price
like I don't I don't think it's worth it
in my opinion please don't be offended I
just don't think it is I also don't love
the the color of it I don't find them to
be anything special and the way that
people were going on and on about it I
thought I was going to discover like
something out of this world this is the
H&amp;amp;M Beauty micellar water mild makeup
remover I'm done I'm done guys I'm so
done with looking for micellar water
that compares to Bioderma for me I'm
just going to continue to buy Bioderma
because I love it so much it's the best
this stuff stung the crap out of my eyes
every micellar water that I've tried
besides Bioderma Sting's my eyes is that
weird
do I have weird eyes I feel like it's an
issue with me in my soul my soul doesn't
want me to like anything except Bioderma
I'm just gonna go with that not only did
this hurt my eyes but this didn't really
take off my makeup that well the Garnier
one took off my makeup better than this
one and even
simple one took off my makeup better
than this one I don't know I mean try it
offer yourself maybe you love it
but this H&amp;amp;M micellar water is it did
like it did nothing like hey bud did did
nothing okay guys so that completes this
