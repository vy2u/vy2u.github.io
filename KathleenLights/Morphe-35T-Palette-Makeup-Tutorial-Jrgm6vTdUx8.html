tutorial on this look right here it's
more of a nighttime look a lot of mobs i
am using the morphe 35c palette I posted
this palette on snapchat a while ago
because I got it in the mail and was
like immediately in love with this
palette it's so so good it has similar
colors to like the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette you know in that color family
rosy bronzes rosy bronzes like a bunch
of gold there's a bunch of bronze e warm
colors but then there's a ton of pinky
cranberry purpley shades so I did go
with the cranberry ma wysz kind of look
today but you can do even like bronzy
chocolatey looks with this too this has
35 eyeshadows of course it's just so so
good I will link the morphe website down

that makes you super uncomfortable I

code thank you so much you save 10% so
it's a win-win and if you want to see
how to get this look then just keep on
watching so I am gonna put my hair back
in this headband thing that I've had
since I was like 10 there we go and now
I'm gonna start on my eyes I'm using the
Jessie's Girl I shadow primer one of my
favorite drugstore primers I would say I
got it at Jessie's Girl cosmetics
come now I'm going to take this la girl
la girl pro prime this is like a
skintone color well my skin tone a
little bit like it and I'm just using
this to cover up all the veins on my
eyelids and act as a base but I do need
to set that base so I'm taking this
little lorac Pro matte palette and I'm
using the one the shade closest to my
skin tone to set that base so that there
are no tackiness when I apply the
eyeshadows okay
so I'm taking this first color in the
palette and I'm using a fluffy brush and
I'm applying this to my crease these
colors in the palette don't have names
so you're just going to go by me
pointing that pointing at them because
they don't have specific names I'm so
sorry that's going to get a little
confusing I'm taking this color which is
under it it's a little bit more brownish
not as purple and I'm just going to do
the same thing I just like the mixture
of those two colors a more money more
brown just to act as my transition shade
now I'm going to take this elf brush and
dip it into the top corner eye shadow
this is going to be the all-over lid
shade this is such a pigmented shade
usually I would go in with mac fix+ but
it doesn't even need it it's metallic
it's stunning I love it so much it's a
nice burgundy color now I'm taking this
brown shade and a skinnier crease brush
and just blending everything together so
that there are no harsh lines and then
taking a fluffy brush and just further
blending now this matte reddish burgundy
shade I love this color
I'm taking that same crease brush that I
used earlier is it the same one well
it's like a fat pencil brush and I am
just focusing this in the crease and
bringing it to the inner corners as well
so on the outer corner and the inner
corner kind of like a halo look but not
really then going back into that fluffy
brush by the way this is from Sephora I
am just blending everything out you know
you know blending Oh going back into
that shade we use on the lid and I just
applied some more to intensify it a
little then I took that golden shade and
added it to the inner corners and I'm
taking this la girl deep bronze eye line
and I'm tight lining with this then I'm
going to add a wing this is the Jessie's
girl liquid liner and I'm adding a wing
and I always start off with little
strokes and then do the tail but I like
I get way too close to the camera and
then you can't see me and I'm a total
failure I'm so sorry so let's move on to
the face before I finish my eyes I'm
just I was laughing so hard editing this
because I look so weird doing that with
my arm but I just spritzed the Josie
Maran Nirvana treatment mist on my face
and then I went in with the Laura
Mercier radiance primer so for a
foundation I'm using the new Too Faced
Born This Way I'm in warm nude I love
this foundation it gives you a super
natural finish not too matte not duly
either it's just a nice natural finish
and it has pretty good coverage
that's my mini review if any of you guys
were wondering I really really like it
but I mean I love everything to face mix
don't I love it now I'm taking this like
peachy salmony shade concealer by Pixie
and I'm applying that underneath my eyes
to help with my dark circles and then
I'm going to go in with concealer right
on top of it so my concealer is the
Maybelline better skin I can't stop
using it it's just so easy to blend and
so lightweight so I'm applying that
underneath my eyes to cover up as well
but also to highlight the face so then
I'm going to apply it to other parts of
my face to continue to highlight and
then look what happens look my camera
got foggy I don't understand how that
happened or why and it's only like in
the center because if you see the
background it's not very foggy it's so
weird the camera got foggy I'm using the
Sedona lace 217 brush to blend
everything out it does stay foggy for a
little bit longer but only for like a
couple minutes and then it goes back to
normal
so I'm sorry so to set my under eye
concealer I'm using the NYX HD setting
powder in the shade banana this is a
real techniques setting brush and it's
good at setting let me tell you this is
the Charlotte Tilbury micro smooth
powder and I'm just going to put this on
my face to not really modify but
so that there is no tackiness when I go
in with my bronzer okay so bronzer of
choice I'm using this Laguna NARS Laguna
bronzer this is like a limited edition
one that came with this tiny eita brush
and let me just tell you I love Laguna
it's one of my favorite bronzers but
this eita brush is not worth the money
and a lot of people are like oh it's
because that one's short but the big one
is worth the money no it sheds like
crazy it sheds like crazy guys it's not
worth it don't spend your money on it
it's really not worth it at least I
don't think so and then I just blended
everything out with my Real Techniques
multitask brush so going back to the
eyes the fogginess is gone I just added
that same eyeliner to my waterline the
one I use to tightline and then I'm
taking that matte reddish burgundy shade
to smoke out the lower lash line and
then a more neutral brown color on the
pencil brush and just really blend
everything out so for our mascara I'm
using my Clinique lash doubling but then
I'm going to go in with falsies these
are the ardell demi whispies falsies and
yes that is what I did for my eyes and
my eyes are complete I wanted my skin to
look a little bit more luminous not so
flat so I took this wedding wild bronzer
in in the in the Cabana and it'll be
listed below I forgot the name but it is
not a bronzer obviously clearly it just
gives it it's like a face powder that
gives a nice subtle sheen very similar
to the hourglass ambient lighting
powders for blush this is um NYX moth I
was going to say mocha what is wrong
with me today okay this is the NYX blush
in the shade mauve and I'm using a
morphe brush to apply that to my shrieks
4 highlight I am using an oldie but a
goodie this is max soft and gentle every
time I use it I'm like why don't I use
you everyday and then I put it back and
I don't use it for a while I don't know
it's a really really pretty
you know you can't go wrong with Mac
soft and gentle so for lips I cannot get
enough of these over liquid lipsticks
I'm sorry I love them this one is in the
shade Pasadena
putting that on my entire lips usually I
would just go ahead and do a nude like a
bare nude with this look but I wanted
something more matchy-matchy but you can
do whatever you want okay guys so that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
