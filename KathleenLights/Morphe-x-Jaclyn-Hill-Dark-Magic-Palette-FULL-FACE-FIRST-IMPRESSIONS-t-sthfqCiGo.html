video and when I went back to look at
the footage on my camera I accidentally
deleted the majority of my intro so I am
back to film the part I deleted but then
I will connect and combine to the other
part that I didn't delete and then it
will carry on from there so you're gonna
see me in full face right now and then
in a few you're gonna see that I'm not
in full face but basically today's video
is a full face of first impressions
they're like two products that weren't
first impressions 2 or 3 but the rest of
the products were first impressions and
also people love these videos and some
people hate them and I know I've been
doing them a lot recently but ever since
I got back from traveling I just feel
like there's so much there's so many new
things and I want to just try them all
and I'm keeping my Invisalign in this
video today I'm keeping it on and I know
that's so annoying I'm so sorry you're
just gonna have to hear my list for one
video because I got my trays changed
yesterday I'm in so much pain right now
my mouth is throbbing and it was so
funny because when I was giving me these
new trays he was like oh by the way now
it starts to get really painful and
really tight and I was like okay what
the hell have I been feeling this whole
time so this is like the tightest it's
ever been and it hurts so much to take
them off and root and put them back on
so please bear with me for this video I
have my Invisalign on order anyway I do
want to show you guys look at this
that's what's on my eyes today by the
way I got the morphe and Jaclyn hill
vault collection and I'm so excited for
this if you guys didn't know you guys
know the morphe Jaclyn hill palette
there were a bunch of shades that she
created but they never ended up making
it into the palette so she created four
separate eyeshadow palettes with some of
those eyeshadows and I just think it's
so amazing this is so I'm so happy for
her this is so great I'm so excited
I know these haven't launched yet but
they think the official launch date is
June 26 and I just love how they did
this
everything has they all have a mirror in
them they're only 15 dollars and they're
all categorized by color like you see
the colors on the palettes so you know
what you're getting just by looking at
them and these palettes are made with
that same exact Jaclyn hill formula that
she created for her Jacqueline Hill
palette I think I'm gonna be using this
one in today's video this is dark magic
and this one just has the coolest smoky
colors ever I love this one I'm being
completely honest with you guys I don't
understand the hate that morphe gets I
could totally understand people being
annoyed by influencers constantly
pushing their code like you cannot go to
more you can go to more me I get that I
have a code and I don't even like
pushing it down people's throats cuz
even I get annoyed I get that part but I
don't get the hate towards the brand
itself I'm gonna zoom you in and start
my makeup so that I'm not like talking
and not doing anything you know I'm
gonna use the P Louise makeup base this
has become like my favorite eyeshadow
primer ever but anyway like I was saying
I would have killed for a brand like
morphe in high school I mean I didn't
wear makeup in high school and then wear
eyeshadow so maybe not me but I always
think about Amelia and stuff because
Amelia used to love the Sedona lace
eyeshadow palettes do you remember those
I was big on YouTube like back in the
day I'm talking about like back in the
day
so I always think about like people in
high school or like people in college
and morphe is so inexpensive or the
quality is so good so I don't understand
it's like man if you're on a budget that
brand is a freaking lifesaver you know I
mean I don't know that's just how I feel
but I mean everybody is entitled to feel
that way that take whew okay so I'm
gonna hop into the dark magic palette
I'm gonna take the shade potion and I'm
just gonna start buffing this color into
the crease it's going to be my crease
transition shade
okay now I'm gonna take the shade
diversion and I'm gonna use my finger
with this one I'm going to pop that all
over the lid I'm not even using fix+ or
anything just popping it on dry but I
will probably go in at the end and add
some fix+ when I'm done blending
everything in the crease and stuff but
you definitely do not need to wet this
eyeshadow now I'm gonna take the color
Shh on my crease and in my outer corner
I'm just gonna use this to like blend
these colors together basically
I'm gonna go back into that olive green
amused potion and I'm going to intensify
the crease because a lot of that green
didn't blend it away with the brown we
just used all right now I'm going to go
into the shape called inside job and I'm
just gonna put this color on the outer
corners and smoke this guy up a little
bit
okay now I'm gonna take some fix+ on a
brush this is a brush from BH Cosmetics
and I'm gonna dip into the shade de
version and I'm gonna use that all over
my lid just to intensify this color okay
I don't know if I like how this
eyeshadow looks wet I kind of feel like
it makes it too intense and I kind of
liked how it looked before I wet it it
definitely does not need fix plus I'll
tell you that much okay I'm gonna add a
little bit more of that inside job color
I really want it to look very green on
the outer corners okay so now I'm gonna
take the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter
liner this is in the shade ac/dc and I
want to add just a little bit of glitter
like right here on top of that
okay I am semi regretting that but I'm
gonna hope that it will come together in
the end so I'm not gonna freak out and
scream just yet
so real good I'm just gonna go
off-camera clean up all this fallout and
then I'll be back so we can do the face
man I definitely did that glitter liner
thing way too thick that's not how
people do it this was the first time I
ever tried doing it so I mean there's a
first time to ruin everything but it to
be because if at first you don't succeed
try for foundation actually do have a
brand new fount brand new foundation to
test out this is the brand new benefit
foundation it's the hello happy soft
blur foundation and I'm pretty sure I'm
in the shade three they send me all
their shades I think they have like 15
shades I don't know how many or
like twelve I don't think there are many
shades actually have to look at that
because I just picked up the shade I
thought it was turned out over this one
and then I left the other shades in the
box because it came with like balls like
the box had a lot of stuff and and oh I
haven't even looked through it but I was
looking at the numbers of foundations
and I think I only saw 15 shades so I
need to come out with more shades I mean
I don't know how deep the range goes or
I don't know how bare it goes but it is
really cute it's very strange it has
this little happy face with the heart
eyes it's cute it's just it's funny I
never I've never seen a foundation like
this and then here's the front light to
medium coverage oh this is this is a
super intense eye look for light to
medium coverage and it also has SPF 15
you already know I'm gonna do half of my
face with a brush and then the other
half with a sponge for a primer I'm just
gonna use my Too Faced hangover RX
primer pop on my entire face
so I'm just gonna squeeze them on to my
it cosmetics love is the foundation
brush and I'm just going to stop popping
that it is a little darker than my skin
tone mmm this smells good like it
doesn't it doesn't smell like like
anything specific but it smells good
like it doesn't like it doesn't smell
bad okay oh that's another thing I in
love that this is in a squeezy tube
thank you benefit I freaking love
squeezy tubes I have a feeling I'm gonna
like this foundation more with a brush
because it isn't too full coverage and I
kind of feel like my Beauty Blender is
gonna suck up some of that coverage I
love to finish with the brush though I
mean it looks a little strange a little
like a little bit around my nose I'll
zoom in in a second but I think it looks
good okay now I'm gonna take my little
sapphire Beauty Blender that I've been
loving and let's try it out on this side
with this sponge hi Jeff as I suspected
it where's that from just as I suspected
the native oh my gosh that's from
somewhere and now I have no idea and
that's gonna drive me crazy for the rest
of day if anyway the Beauty Blender does
take away some of that coverage but I do
like the finish on this side as well my
hair looks crazy today my mom needs a
diamond yeah okay so I think I like both
finishes actually I think it looks
really nice with a Beauty Blender and
with a brush a little heavy around the
nose but man that happens to me with
almost every foundation it looks nice
and fresh and when I touch my face I
don't feel any tackiness to it it's like
barely tacky which is nice I thought it
was gonna be a little bit more tacky
since it does look a little bit luminous
but no I don't feel any tackiness
alright so for concealer I do have a new
concealer to test out I'm not sure if
this is brand brand new but it's new to
me and actually it might be new because
they send me this giant PR for it PR for
it yeah this line makes me talk weird
this is the Tarte creaseless concealer
now tart shape tape is the way to go
okay
think anything could possibly be tarp
shape tape but I'm gonna try this
creaseless concealer I'm gonna try it
they did send me three full size the
rest of these are samples and I'm gonna
take the shade light/medium neutral when
I was watching Miss Saigon the back of
my hand to feel the consistency it feels
extremely sticky I'm a little bit
concerned about that so I'm gonna work
one eye at a time a consistency it goes
on really thick and the consistency
honestly just reminded me of the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye and if
you've ever felt that it's it's very
sticky very full coverage a little goes
along let's see like if I applied too
much a little goes a long long way and
this just felt the same is felt so
similar it's called the creaseless
concealer so I'm hoping it doesn't
crease sorry I keep looking in the
freaking viewfinder I kind of feel like
it's separating on top of my thumb they
should but that could just be the combo
of this concealer and that foundation I
don't know if they really work well
together it doesn't it bad though I just
feel like I don't know let me do the
other eye
this doesn't really freaking great
coverage though like that just takes
away your under-eyes like immediately
but it feels just very tacky which
usually techy concealers are very Creasy
okay I'm gonna add a little bit more on
this side because I feel like here is
where it's separated a little bit and I
just want me with my finger that works
better oh yeah this is a super super
dewy concealer like it's my under eyes
look hydrated guys man I feel like that
really covered up my under-eye circles
though what do you guys think I think
that looks pretty good I mean if you
like a duly under eye that looks pretty
good I don't have a brand new setting
powder to use like for the first time so
I'm gonna use my color pop no filter
setting powder the loose one in
translucent looks really nice actually
I'm kind of impressed with that
under-eye concealer at the like I really
thought I was gonna hate it but I don't
know I have to test it out a little bit
more but feel like it covered up my Dark
Souls it didn't crease that bad and it
looks okay when I said it and it looked
I think I like it so now I'm gonna
finish up the rest of the eyes well you
know and then go back to the face you
know we do this all the time
alright I'm gonna go into the shade and
I'm just gonna blend a little bit of
this color on my lower lash line
but then I'm going to go into potion and
I'm really really gonna pack this color
on my lower lash line
and now I'm gonna go into inside job and
I'm gonna focus this color on the outer
corners just to match the top part of my
eyes and I'm also gonna intensify the
outer corners with this color as well so
I'm gonna pop on some eyeliner really
quick this is the NYX faux blacks
eyeliner in the shade black olive then
for my inner corner so I'm just gonna go
into a power cut and I'm gonna pop that
on so I know this look calls for falsies
but I'm actually in a hurry I have an
appointment to go to and and kind of
ring late so I don't have time for puffy
so I'm just gonna curl my lamp chains
and then I'm gonna put on some monkey
big mascara from Lancome I'll be right
back I really really like how this eye
makeup turned out I think it's so
stunning I used only this palette and I
think it is beautiful I love this
palette it's so smoky and the colors
really show up like that green really
showed up both greens I am very very
impressed like wow so for bronzer I do
have a new bronzer to test out this is
the Becca gradient sunlit bronzer in the
shade sunrise waves and this bronzer is
really cool because it has like these
gradients here in the middle like the
different tones of bronzer but then it
has two strips of opal here on the side
and I really wanted to test this out
because I saw Jamie Paige beauty use
this in a video and it looked so
gorgeous so I just knew I knew that I
wanted to try it out but before I go in
with this I do want to contour a little
bit with this because this is a pretty
glowy bronzer so I'm gonna take my drive
cosmetics rheya bronzer I'm gonna take
my Wayne Goss 14 brush and I'm just
gonna contour the cheeks it
and now I'm gonna go in with the Becca
bronzer I'm mainly gonna dip into the
center I don't want too much of that
opal coming through but I am sweeping it
across the oval a little bit
this just looked so pretty on Jamie and
I could gave her this glowy flush to the
skin it was gorgeous I love Lily
bronzers so when I saw that I was like
oh I know me love that there's no see I
already do like can you see that I don't
know if you can tell ah it's just like
Chloe but in a non shimmery way it's
like literally glowy for blush I Bri
cently bought the new L'Oreal like peach
blushes I got two colors I use one on
for the first time in my boxycharm
unboxing but I haven't tried this one
just yet this one is called bashful I
used just curious in my other video and
I really really liked just curious this
one in bashful is similar but it's a
little bit more shimmery so I'm gonna
take my makeup forever stippling brush
and like I said in my boxycharm video
just in case you didn't see that these
blushes smell amazing if you didn't like
the Too Faced sweet peach collection
because the peach scent was just too
strong it was too sweet
this one isn't like that this one is a
little bit more mild which I like I mean
I like both sense but I think it smells
really really good and this color is
very pretty it's just like a nice soft
peach blush I might like this one more
than just curious actually it kind of
has a golden sheen to it
yeah no heat oh my gosh I want for
highlight I do want to test this one out
I just recently purchased this it's the
Roman highlighter in the shade prismatic
light and when I swatch this this does
feel very powdery but I'm hoping that
it's gonna apply nicer so I'm gonna take
my eco tools controlled setting brush
because I cannot find my color pops mop
color pop small flat brush I took it
with me recently to Orlando so it's
probably in my makeup bag but too lazy
to check
that looks really pretty you can tell
that it's not like a metallic powder
it's more of a satin powder but it does
have a subtle glow to it oh I actually
do like that
I definitely do think there are prettier
highlights at the drugstore though okay
and then for lips Laurie OH also
released these new infallible Pro matte
liquid lipsticks that are like the
chocolate collection they show peanuts
scented liquid lipsticks and I'm very
very excited because I haven't even
smelled it yet
I wanted to smell it with you guys on
camera this is in the shade sweet tooth
a bunch of colors were already sold out
so I was only able to get this in like
another color but it is a very very nude
nude color so really quickly I'm gonna
line my lips with my Maybelline Tora lip
liner and now I'm gonna go in with sweet
tooth let's smell this oh that smell for
a split second it's not like dirty feet
but no it's chocolate I like it
so oh wow this is new
I'm gonna pop on some gloss because I am
dying to try this out this is brand-new
from la girl la girl is so affordable
like ridiculously cheap and they came
out with these holographic topper lip
glosses
and this is in the shade ah it doesn't
say it but it's the golden one it's like
the yellowy golden 100 oh well it's not
what I expected I thought it was just
gonna have a little bit of shimmer but
dang this has shimmer
I went from trying to look like Jennifer
Lopez to lookin like Medusa if I didn't
have this eye makeup I think this might
be cool I mean it I feel I look like
Medusa it does feel a little sticky
though but not bad sticky and I really
like the glitter in this like this is
really really intense it's not something
to be messed with so if you're looking
for a holographic shimmery lip gloss
that's very very affordable look no
further
holographic top or by la girl anyway
guys that completes this video I pretty
much liked everything I think the
foundation oxidized just a little bit on
my skin but besides that I think it
looks nice anyway guys let me know what
