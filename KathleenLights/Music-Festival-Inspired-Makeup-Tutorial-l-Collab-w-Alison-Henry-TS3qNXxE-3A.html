tutorial on these really colorful eyes
it is actually a festival inspired
makeup look and this tutorial is
actually a special one because it is a
collab with Allison Henry here on
YouTube I'm sure you guys have seen her
videos and I'm sure most of you guys are
subscribed to her channel already and we
decided that we were going to do a
collab video and she had the great idea
of doing a festival inspired kind of
look since there are so many festivals
going on right now and this kind of look
is just perfect for this time of year
going into spring and summer I know this
isn't a super wearable look it's more on
the dramatic side but I decided to do
something fun and vibrant since it is
festival inspired and I don't know I
think it turned out pretty cool I added
these little studs and now if you can
see them but I added them after the
tutorial I thought it would give it a
little little pizazz I don't know but
yeah after you're watching this video go
ahead and check out Allison's festival
makeup and go ahead and subscribe to her
channel if you're not already subscribed
she has amazing makeup skills like just
20 times better than me and I love her
I've been subscribed to her for over a
year now and I just love that she does
not care what anybody has to say about
her she's really good about letting the
negative comments just flow off her back
and I love people like that I love
people who are who they are no matter
what anybody says but anyway this intro
is probably already a little bit too
long if you want to see how to get this
festival colorful inspired makeup then
just keep watching okay guys so we're
going to start off by priming our
eyelids I am using Mac's painterly
paint-pot this is just going to cover up
all my little veins then I'm going to go
in with a fluffy brush and dip that into
Mac's
soft Brown and I am going to buff this
into my crease and this is going to be
my transition shade
and it's going to help all the colors
just blend better next I'm going to be
taking the Urban Decay electric palette
and I'm going to go into the bright
orange shade called slow burn and I'm
going to be packing this on the inner
half of my eyelid
next I'm going to be taking this matte
hot pink in the palette called savage
and I'm going to apply this on the rest
of my bare lid I'm not going to take any
of these colors past the crease I'm just
going to be applying it right up to the
crease next I'm going to go back into
the soft brown color and I'm just going
to buff it into the crease again just to
blend out any of the harsh lines and
then really quickly I'm just going to go
back over the pink and the orange one
more time I'm going to take this eye
shadow by makeup geek it's called Peach
Smoothie and I am going to be doing the
same thing I did with the soft brown
color this doesn't make a huge
difference it just gives it a little bit
more of a peachy shade then I'm going to
go into this color here called Delta
turn into the very pinky purple and I'm
going to start applying this into the
crease with a small crease brush I'm
just going to go back and forth with
that eye shadow and building the color
up little by little
you
then with a fluffy blending brush not
adding any more eyeshadow onto the brush
and I'm just going to buff that color
out I'm going to take my Maybelline
master drama in midnight master and I'm
going to tightline with this and then
I'm going to add my wing I could never
do this on camera I know I'm sorry I
just get out of focus because I get
closer and closer to the mirror and then
I don't realize I get out of focus I
need to work on that I'm sorry but I am
just going to take the Milani eye tech
perfection and add a wing to my eyes to
highlight underneath my brow bone I am
going to take max shroom and then I'm
going to move on to the rest of my face
before I do the rest of my eye makeup
and I'm just going to take the l'oreal
Revitalift miracle blur and add just a
little bit of this around my nose and on
my forehead the foundation I'm going to
be using is the L'Oreal True Match this
is in the shade and three natural buff
and I'm going to be applying this with
my Real Techniques sponge
I'm going to take my mac prolongwear
concealer and I'm going to apply this
underneath my eyes and I'm using this
concealer because it is full coverage
and since I'm going to be applying
purple eyeshadow underneath my eyes I
want to make sure that the purple dark
circles are all covered up
whatever is left on my sponge I'm going
to take it in between my eyebrows down
my nose on my Cupid's bow and a little
bit on my chin I'm going to set that
concealer using the Maybelline fit me
powder in 1/35 creamy natural
to finish off my eyes I'm going to take
this Knicks slide on glide on eyeliner
in the shade pretty violet and I'm going
to apply this to my waterline next I'm
taking the shade called urban it is a
dark purple and on a tiny little brush
I'm going to smudge this underneath that
pretty violet eyeliner we just applied
I'm going to take this color right here
called thrash and I'm going to add this
to my inner tear duct and this is just
going to give a little bit more color to
the look I'm using the Clinique bottom
lash mascara on my bottom lashes and
then I'm going to be applying Clinic's
lash doubling mascara to my top lashes
I'm just going to be adding a thin thin
coat of this because I am going to be
applying false lashes I know again
shocking this is the second tutorial in
a row where I'm using falsies and I
never use falsies but I figured a look
like this deserved fake lashes
especially if it is for festival or
anything like that you need to go with
falsies I think so to finish up my face
I'm going to be taking these Sephora so
the heel bronzer and I'm taking this on
my elf brush and just applying this all
over my face contouring but not really
just bronzing up mostly
next I'm taking the bombs cindy lou
manizer on my it cosmetics blush brush
and i'm going to apply this to my cheeks
this is like the most beautiful thing in
the world I'm obsessed with it it just
gives such a pretty glow I'm taking else
matte lipstick in the shade oral and I'm
applying this to my lips then I'm
topping it off with the NYX butter gloss
in creme brulee
okay guys so that completes this
festival inspired makeup tutorial I
really hope you enjoy it I know it's not
the typical everyday kind of look but I
think it is really really fun please

really appreciate it and thank you so so
