a video that I've been wanting to do for
a long time now it's been really really
requested as well we were talking about
my Holy Grail makeup products like my
favorite makeup products of all time I'm
gonna go in each category like my
favorite foundation favorite concealer a
favorite blush my favorite highlight and
this specific video is only talking
about drugstore Holy Grail products so
these are products that you can get at
the drugstore and they are my ultimate
favorites it's really hard to narrow
down especially me that I have a YouTube
channel and this is kind of like my job
in my hobby and I'm always collecting
makeup and I'm always trying new things
I have so many products in each category
like in my makeup collection that it's
really hard to narrow it down so the
fact that I picked out a specific
product in each category says a lot
about these things these are my favorite
favorite favorite favorite products so
I'm going to start with face products
and the first category is primer and I
really do like the L'Oreal magic lumi
light infusing primer but when I sat
down and I looked at all of my drugstore
primers this is just the one that I use
the most this is the NYX angel oil skin
perfecting primer in my opinion this is
the best drugstore primer it feels
really really silky on your skin it's
kind of like a mixture between a
moisturizer but then it's like a
silicone II primer it's I don't know how
to explain it it feels like velvet it
makes makeup apply so much easier on top
of it it's a great base for foundation
and it makes my makeup last longer so my
next category is foundation and I'm
someone who really really loves
drugstore foundations Maybelline fit me
I really like the Revlon Colorstay for
dry skin that was like my ultimate
favorite drugstore foundation since I
started my channel but if I'm gonna be
completely honest the Bourjois healthy
mix serum is my favorite you cannot get
this at the drugstore in the States but
I believe you can get this at the
drugstore like overseas but if you are
in the States you can purchase this on
Amazon this is where I bought it I have
mine in the shade 52 vanilla it's the
foundation I'm wearing on my face right
now it gives you buildable coverage its
sheer de medium
and it just looks so dewy and fresh but
it doesn't feel like super tacky and
greasy it's just a beautiful finish it
lasts a really really long time on my
skin for concealer there was no
competition no questions
I loved the Maybelline fit me concealer
it's my favorite drugstore concealer I
don't think I've ever found a concealer
I love more than this and this does not
cake up it looks so fresh and beautiful
it has really really great coverage I do
like a lot of drugstore concealers as
well but this one for sure is my
favorite okay so when it comes to powder
if we're strictly talking drugstore
powder I have to talk about the
Maybelline fit me
it doesn't emphasize dry patches it
doesn't look like I'm wearing powder
when I wear this I have mine in the
shade 135 creamy natural this is what I
use to set my under eye concealer I used
it today but honestly if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you I would save
my money purchase the RCM a no color
powder this is only ten dollars I know
this is a drugstore video and this is
not a drugstore product but it is a
drugstore price $10 and you get so much
it ends up being more affordable than
powders at the drugstore if you think
about it so my next category is bronzer
and there was no competition here my
all-time favorite is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster bronzer I have
mine in the shade medium to dark
Physicians Formula makes the best
bronzers at the drugstore this is my
opinion but they are so creamy so
blendable so buttery I never get
patchiness with bronzers from Physicians
Formula they're just really high-quality
I feel like I'm putting on a high-end
bronzer this is the bronzer I have on my
face today I just used a little bit to
just warm up my complexion if you guys
are wondering the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer which is also like an
all-time favorite bronzer from the
drugstore they're very similar this one
is a little bit warmer this one is a
little bit more neutral I really love
Physicians Formula bronzers they're so
good so blush was kind of a hard
category for me I didn't know which one
to choose I have two right here and I'm
just going to show both of them to you
because I love them both the same
they're both my favorite I really could
not pick one and the first one is the
Milani baked blush in Luminoso
so I know you've heard about this I know
you have everybody talks about this and
it's like everybody's favorite but for a
reason it's a beautiful glowy peachy
pink blush this is the blush I'm wearing
on my cheeks right now it just gives
your face life you dust a little bit of
luminol so on your cheeks and it's like
you're fresh and young and youthful I
love it and then my other favorite has
to be the ELF pressed mineral blush and
sweet retreat I've used this a ton it's
a really neutral
pinky color really pretty it goes with
so many looks these blushes the mineral
blushes are so creamy and buttery like
oh my god they feel so good like they're
so good okay so my favorite highlight
from the drugstore is the highlight
that's on my face right now it's been my
favorite since I started my channel
since I discovered it this is the
positions formula shimmer strip in Miami
strip they have a bunch of different
shades Miami strip is my favorite not
cuz I'm like from Miami or anything I
just really like this one I only use the
first three strips right here because
the other ones are like bronzers I
rarely use like the gold strip on its
own I always mix it in with the pink one
this could possibly be my favorite
highlight of all-time high-end and
low-end like that's how that's how much
I love this I don't use it as much as I
used to on my channel because I'm always
you know using different highlights and
loving different highlights highlights
is like my favorite thing in the world
but this bad boy is right or die a lot
of people don't like it because of the
stiff formula but you have to get like
kind of like a scratchy brush and really
like mix it up in there to kind of get
like that weird hard layer off but once
you do that it's so I mean I love it
okay so let's talk about a shadow primer
I have to say that I've tried a lot of
eye shadow primers the elf one I liked
for awhile I really love the Jessie's
girl one but after discovering this one
this one has to be my favorite this is
the Milani eyeshadow primer it's really
similar to Too Faced shadow insurance
and the primer potion by urban decay it
reminds me a lot of those I highly
recommend this Milani one if you want
your eyeshadows to last longer this is a
great one but I have to
about this this is the Knicks glitter
primer this is my favorite glitter
primer ever it's better than the elf one
it's a little bit more expensive it's a
few dollars more but it's better it's
better than the two-faced glitter glue I
love it so much more
this makes pigments look beautiful
I'll usually just apply this so like the
center of my lid and then apply like a
pigment or a glitter on top amazing I
highly recommend this okay so I shadows
I have two pallets to share with you I'm
going to share with you my favorite
eyeshadow palettes if you want to see my
all-time favorite drugstore single
shadows leave me a comment down below
and I'll do a whole video on my favorite
single shadows from the drugstore so
let's just talk about my favorite
eyeshadow palette I know I've tried out
really great ones recently and the
Milani one is amazing but if I'm really
going to talk about my favorite favorite
and the ones that I've used for so long
and that I love so much it's gonna be
this guy right here and this is the
Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral matte
palette this you can't get like at
Walgreens or anything but they do sell
Sonia Kashuk at Target in the drugstore
section this palette is pricier than a
normal drugstore palette this is $20 but
you do get 12 I shadow so if you think
about it that's it's not that bad
I love this palette it's completely
matte you can use this with any palette
you have your perfect crease shades
no matter your skin tone because they
have lighter ones they have darker ones
it has a really great black and my other
favorite and funny enough it's just a
completely shimmery palette it's the
Prizm eyeshadow palette by elf I have
mine in the shade naked I have all of
them but naked is hands-down my favorite
I think it's the best one this is what
it looks like it's a completely metallic
palette what makes me so crazy about
this palette is I use a lot of fix+ with
eyeshadows like if you watch a lot of my
tutorials I'm always spraying fix+ on my
brush because it they fix+ intensifies
eyeshadows this is a palette that you
don't need to fix plus I mean sometimes
I will use it with this but you don't
need to these channels are that
pigmented that metallic that beautiful
and it makes me sad that I don't hear
much about this palette because I think
it's one of the best at the drugstore
so my next category
is eyeliners I'm gonna I'm gonna let you
guess for a second what is my favorite
eyeliner at the drugstore you guess the
NYX lazuli hey try really hard to say
that gel pencil liners you are correct
these are my favorite favorite eyeliners
of all time but especially from the
drugstore I have mine in shade brown and
this one is called pitch black I don't
think they make other colors I wish they
would if they do leave me a comment down
below because I need to go pick them up
I think these are amazing they're super
pigmented they last all day on my
waterline and they don't fade throughout
the day and they're just so creamy and I
love them for mascara this one was a
little bit tricky
I love drugstore mascaras you can find
amazing mascaras at the drugstore my
favorite one that I've been using you
guys know is the Kiko extra sculpt
Volume Mascara this isn't a drugstore
product but it is a very very affordable
brand so this extra sculpt mascara might
be my favorite mascara in the universe
that's a big statement but when I sat
down and I looked at all the mascaras I
currently own these have to be my
favorite I really could not decide
I love the Jordana best lash extreme
because it's very volumizing and very
very very inexpensive I believe this is
a three dollar mascara you can get
Jordana at Walgreens but I also really
love the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black
it makes my lashes look so long and like
dramatic really really love these you
guys know the Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner is my favorite the shade black
I don't like the colorful ones in this
range but the black one is amazing it is
pretty much an exact dupe for the Kat
Von D tattoo liner in trooper pretty
much exact - and more affordable you can
find this eyeliner at Rite Aid or on the
Jessie's Girl cosmetics website love
this so black so long wearing so
fabulous okay so now I'm going to talk
about brows really quick
my favorite brow Wiz from the drugstore
is the NYX one I know that the L'Oreal
one is getting a lot of hype and that
one is really really really really good
but I just love the NYX one more
or something about it it's a little bit
creamier I relive it I don't think my
eyebrows are have ever looked so bad
ever in ever trying to let them grow out
I'm trying to let them get like really
bushy so that I can reshape them but
it's getting really difficult you're
just getting so bushy that it's hard for
me to fill them in and ignore those
other hairs that are just like all over
the place I'm gonna have to do them soon
because I can't I can't do this whole
like layer eyebrows grow and then
reshape them thing they're getting
they're getting super bushy but anyway
that's besides the point the NYX micro
brow pencil in the shade brunette is my
favorite little brow is at the drugstore
I love it and my favorite eyebrow gel of
all time of all time is the Loreal brow
stylist plumper I have mine in the shade
light to medium
this is the best brow gel in my opinion
I find that it makes my eyebrows like
stay in place
it's pigmented it gives them a little
bit of thickness so good okay and then
the last category is lips so my favorite
lip liners from the drugstore are the
Jordana easy liner for lips these are so
good they're very very creamy they're
retractable which I really appreciate I
love a retractable lips liner and
they're like two dollars they're so
inexpensive even for drugstore prices
they're a lot cheaper than most products
of the drugstore this one is in the
shade tanya have it this one is in this
we tony have a bunch of different colors
but they just glide on and then they set
and they stay on my lips all day i love
them so much and now for lipstick i
actually have like a favorite drugstore
lipstick but i'm gonna talk about
another lipstick first when you ask me
like what are the best lipsticks at the
drugstore quality-wise like formula i'm
going to say the maybelline creamy matte
lipsticks they are my favorite like of a
whole they are my favorite lipsticks at
the drugstore hands-down this one is in
the shade clay crush and this is the
lipstick that i am wearing they are
matte because you can see it's a matte
lipstick but they feel so comfortable I
barely feel like I'm
barring any lipstick they go on so
creamy and buttery and not drying at all
my favorite lipstick of all time this is
going to be so random I know I've
mentioned it in the past on my channel
but it is the Revlon Super Lustrous
matte lipstick in the shade normy pink
this is what it looks like I believe
this is like my second stormy pink and
I'm like halfway through this I used to
wear this to work every single day when
I first started my channel and I worked
at the next I wore this to work like
every day because it is loud but it's
not too loud I used to just apply like a
really light layer and it just gave my
face some life because I would do very
minimal make-up to work and then this
just little pop of color on my lips I
love to I wore it all the time I just
loved stormy pink ok so that completes
this video these are my holy grail
drugstore products in each category I
