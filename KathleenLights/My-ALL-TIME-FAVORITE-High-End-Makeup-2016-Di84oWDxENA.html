down to film this video this nail-polish
chipped
isn't that beautiful I've had 17 cups of
coffee so today's video is part two in
my Holy Grail little two-part little
series I will link Monday's video below
I talked about all my Holy Grail
products from the drugstore today's
video is strictly high-end Holy Grails
so I'm gonna go in each category like
favorite foundation concealer blush
bronzer I'm doing all categories and
before I get into this video I do want
to mention something this video is extra
exciting for me because it is a collab
with my friend Jamie here on YouTube
her YouTube channel is Jamie page Beauty
I will link her channel down below I
asked her to collab with me because
she's fantastic she has such a good
channel you know like when you come
across some youtubers and you're like
wow this is a great channel that's how I
feel that's weird but that's how I feel
about Jamie she puts so much time and
effort into her channel she's just
really informative as well I love
watching her videos and we talk all the
time she actually helps me out a lot
with my channel because I don't know how
to end it very well I don't know how to
do anything and she helps me so Thank
You Jamie
you are the best please subscribe to her
Channel and let her know that I sent to
you I will link it below and like I said
in my other video I have a lot of makeup
and the fact that these are my true
standout must-haves says a lot so let's
jump in my first category is primer I'm
starting out with face products first
and it honestly was a toss-up between
these two I could not pick which one my
favorite was this is the Too Faced
hangover RX or hangover X replenishing
face primer this is so great I love this
this is my second bottle it has coconut
water probiotics and it's silicone free
this is a great primer if you have dry
skin because it just feels like you're
putting on a moisturizer but it sinks in
so fast it just makes my skin feel
incredible I love how foundation applies
right on top of this I wouldn't say that
this prolongs my a makeup that much but
I do find that makeup generally lasts
longer if I'm putting a good
bass down so I love this it's amazing
and I had to mention this one as well
because I've used this one a ton it's
also a big favorite of mine
it is the Laura Mercier foundation
primer in radiance this one is just like
a white consistency that blends out into
nothing it pretty much looks like a
moisturizer this is like a very shimmery
champagne
glowy kind of primer find that my
foundation might look a little bit too
flat or to matte I like to apply this
one first because it just makes
everything nice and glowy so for my next
category its foundation if you've been
following me for a while you know my
favorite foundation it is hands down the
makeup forever face and body foundation
I don't really use this too much like on
my channel because I try to rotate
throughout all of my foundations because
honestly I could get rid of every single
foundation and only keep this this one
and the makeup over Ultra HD and the
makeup over stick I feel like to make it
firmer makes amazing foundations but
this one is definitely my all-time
favorite whenever I go to events or
whenever I go out any time I need to be
somewhere important like not the grocery
store I will put on the make a firmer
face and body and I always get
complimented on my skin especially from
a lot of subscribers when I meet
subscribers I got generation Beauty or
famous always like wow your face doesn't
look cakey like at all it looks like if
you barely have any foundation on and
it's because this stuff is flawless it's
amazing you can put 37 layers of this
and it will never look cakey it's a very
very sheer coverage this is very similar
to the Mac face and body foundation but
that one broke me out really bad it's
very liquidy it's pretty much like 80%
water I'm not exactly sure but that's
what it feels like anyway I don't like
to use this with a Beauty Blender
because I find that it just soaks up
into my Beauty Blender so I always use
it with this brush right here this is my
favorite brush to apply it it is the e6
by morphe
i have just one layer of this all over
my face and you could see like my skin
like my vein right here my skin does
peek through if I want more coverage
I'll just put on like 3 or 4 layers and
it just does not look bad this
photographs really well and it lasts
decades on my skin it's like the most
long wearing foundation
- I have nothing about to say it comes
in a pump it's amazing it's so good so
now let's go to concealer and this one
might shock a lot of you cuz I never use
this on my channel but I have just
discovered recently that this is by far
my favorite high-end concealer and it is
the NARS radiant creamy concealer I used
to be like ah you know what I like my
Maybelline fit me more bla bla bla
no this this is my favorite and I know
that in my yearly favourites I spoke
about the Urban Decay Naked skin that is
my second favorite concealer of all time
and I thought for a while that that was
number one but I just realized that I
grabbed this one way more than I grabbed
that one and that that has to tell me
something I always keep this in my
travel makeup bag or in my purse that's
why I really don't use it on camera but
this is the concealer I use the most
I just bought a brand new bottle because
I just finished it but I just love the
finish that's what I love about it most
this is a concealer it take with me
every time I travel generation Beauty
any of those events I'm always wearing
NARS radiant creamy concealer it's my
favorite for powder my favorite high-end
powder was the Charlotte Tilbury
micro smooth one that was like my
favorite for a while and it's still
amazing that's like a really great
powder or foundation but this is just my
favorite I spoke about it recently but
this is the cosmetics bye bye pours
airbrush silk pressed finishing powder I
just find that it sets my under-eye
concealer so beautifully it sets my
makeup so beautifully I'm not exactly
sure if this gives me a white cast I
actually don't think it does I've never
noticed in photos but whenever my pores
just look really large this takes it
away instantly it like makes my pores
invisible and no other powder does that
for me this will just like erase them
it's insane
okay so my favorite favorite favorite
high-end bronzer has to be the girl
lactic matte bronzer in the shade Cabo
this is the bronzer I'm wearing on my
face right now
I just love how buttery it is it's so
easy to blend even if I don't set my
foundation sometimes bronzer will skip
over it and this one doesn't do that
because
just so smooth and creamy and just
blends really nicely I love everything
about it they also have a different
shade in Casablanca but that one is a
little bit warmer this one is a little
bit more neutral Casablanca
I said Casablanca okay so blush that is
the next category can you guess what my
favorite blush is I've mentioned it
about a million times I know but this is
the best this is my favorite this is the
NARS blush in the shade madly this is
one of those blushes that swatches so
basic like when you swatch this on the
back your hand you're like what this is
really not that great but putting it on
your cheeks it's beautiful I have a
little bit on my face today I just added
like a little bit of blush as usual I
never go like to hand on the blush this
complements every look in my opinion
like you could have a smoky eye a very
natural eye and it goes with everything
it's my travel buddy I always take this
with me when I travel it's my favorite
blush it's so beautiful and I have like
a million blushes so that's saying a lot
okay the highlight category it was
really hard for me to decide because
have so many highlights I love but this
hand down has to be my favorite this is
the Laura Mercier matte radiance baked
powder in the shade zero one highlight
and it says it's matte but it's not it's
the highlight I'm wearing on my face
right now
I prefer kind of like pearly champagne
shades over like intense gold shades I
find them a little bit more flattering
on my skintone I always recommend this
one if you are someone who has like
really textured skin or you have very
large pores highlight emphasizes all of
that on your face like when you put it
on your face you always see like the
little pimples or any texture on your
face this one doesn't really do that
it's the smoothest highlight I own I
don't know if it's because it's like a
matte highlight even though it has a
glow it just doesn't emphasize all the
nasty like texture I have on my skin
okay so let's move on to the eyes
actually let's move on to eyebrows in my
opinion when it comes to brows I think
you cannot go wrong with a Nastasia
Beverly Hills
I feel like Anasazi makes the best brow
products I really love their brow gel
their clear brow gel their tinted brow
gel I love their brow is I've been using
the brow Wiz since I was like 17 or 18
I've been using it for years but my
favor
it has to be the brow definer it's
actually her newest product so I haven't
really been using it like for so long
but I find that it's so easy to fill in
my brows I like a little bit more of a
bolder brow and this one just lasts on
my brows all day and it gets the job
done so fast so the Anastasio brow
definer is my favourites my favorite eye
primer is definitely the Mac prep and
prime 24 hour extended eye base out of
all the primers I've ever used this one
just keeps my eyeshadow in place the
longest and it prevents creasing it
makes my eyeshadows look intense it has
kind of like a tacky finish so
eyeshadows just stick to it so well I
love everything about this this really
does last a really long time what is my
favorite eyeshadow palette if you have
been watching me for any amount of time
you know that it is the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette I have so many
pallets I have a whole drawer full of
palettes and this one is my favorite I
just recently bought a new one because
mine was so beat up and janky that I
wanted to replace it I will link
tutorials using this down below I
actually think that I just posted one
you can get so many different looks out
of this something a little bit more
smoky something a little bit more
natural I'm more of a natural eye shadow
wearer so this is my favorite I'm
actually wearing some of these
eyeshadows today and it smells like
vanilla cocoa it smells so good it's
definitely my favorite one out of all
the chocolate bar palettes that two-face
has ok let's talk about eyeliners I have
two different eyeliners to share with
you guys one is a liquid eyeliner and
one is just a regular pencil liner this
to me is the best liquid liner high-end
ever I lost this for months and I
recently found it again and I'm so happy
because it's seriously fantastic it is
the most matte liquid liner
I know aside from the NYC liquid liner
that's super matte but I really don't
like the brush on that one I find it
really hard to use this one has a super
super thin little bridge you can get the
perfect perfect little flick and it's so
Matt I don't really like a glossy
eyeliner this one is amazing and then
for a regular pencil eyeliner the Mac
eye Kohl in Costa reach is my favorite
eyeliner
I've gone through like three of these
I've been wearing it since I was like 16
years old
I just really love how it makes my eyes
look it makes them look a little bit
more green it's a warm brown but it's
it's stunning I love it and then my
favorite mascara when it comes to
high-end I really could not decide so
I'm just gonna talk about both of them
really quick this is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara this is a great
volumizing mascara it can get a little
bit flaky so I don't really use this one
on my lower lashes but it makes my
eyelashes look so voluminous and my
other favorite and I think that I might
like this one just that a little I don't
know I might like this want to hear more
this is the benefit roller lash I find
that it really keeps my eyelashes curled
all day and it gives me a lot of length
and volume I actually have a mixture of
these two on the eyes today I didn't
know what to say for lipliner because I
have so many different lip liners that I
love from so many different brands so I
can't sit here and tell you this one is
my all-time favorite but I really love
the makeup forever lip liners and the
Too Faced perfect lip lip liners are my
favorite the nude one is my favorite
nude lip liner ever but let's talk about
lipstick this this lipstick out of all
the lipsticks I own this is my favorite
lipstick hands down this is the NARS
audacious lipstick in the shade Raquel
which by the way the NARS audacious
lipsticks are my favorite high-end
lipsticks they're 20 times better than
the YSL lipsticks I love them they're
the best they're very pricey they're $32
but I think the YSL ones are that same
price and they're nowhere near as good
like nowhere near it looks like I've
barely touched this because I literally
just like to dab this on my lips and I'm
good to go it's my perfect nude like it
is my perfect nude the audacious
lipsticks have the best formula I've
ever tried in a lipstick and I wanted to
mention my favorite high-end liquid
lipstick because I feel like that is
what I use most often if I'm going to be
honest so I have a top three favorite
high-end liquid lipsticks and it is the
dose of colors one's the girl lactic
ones and then the overall liquid
lipsticks those are my favorite but I
think that I might like the Oprah ones
the best by like a hair I'm wearing
Miami fever right now
obviously I love this one another one
that I truly truly love is Sal Paulo
this is like my perfect every day liquid
lipstick I can literally wear this every
single day it's amazing it's like a
really pretty peachy nude I love them
they do transfer a little bit but I find
that they are the most comfortable
liquid lipsticks I've ever tried I have
a coupon code for Ofra by the way I will
link that below
