hey guys so today's video is going to be
my foundation routine specifically my
really dewy foundation routine recently
I've been going for really dewy skin I
just love how it looks
I love the glow on the cheeks so I
really wanted to share this with you
guys
it is using mainly drugstore products
not everything in this video is
drugstore but my foundation is drugstore
and my concealer and my highlighting
powder mainly what makes me Dewey is
drugstore I was actually wearing this
exact look in a recent video where I was
reviewing the bombs read my lips
lip glosses and a lot of you guys were
like wow your skin looks so fresh and
dewy show us how you got that and I was
like absolutely I will so I thought it
was a great idea I have been loving this
look anyway so I decided to make the
video this is going to be a talked
through video because I feel like I
don't do those very often so I hope you
enjoyed that so if you want to sing my
really dewy foundation routine then just
keep watching if you hear my dogs in the
back there acting full right now ok so
the first thing you want to do is prime
my face I always prime my face right
before foundation these dogs and the
primer I'm using is my Too Faced primed
and poreless this is just a little
sample size I got at Sephora
and I'm just adding it to the places
where my pores show the most so the
foundation I'm going to be using is my
Maybelline fit me foundation I am in the
shape 220 this is the shade I have when
I'm self-tanning which I am currently
and I usually love my foundations with a
Beauty Blender but for this specific
foundation I love using my makeup geek
Foundation stippling brush only because
I feel like it is already dewy and it
sheers out nicely on its own that I
don't need my Beauty Blender I love my
Beauty Blender on like thick foundations
or more full coverage foundations but
something like a BB cream and a
moisturizer or a nice dewy finish type
of foundation I like this brush so I'm
just going to dump some on the back of
my hand just about this much I don't
really need a lot I feel like it does a
really good job of just blending out my
skin tone not blending out evening out
my skin tone and I just love how natural
this foundation looks
it looks crazy because it's a lot darker
than my face but it matches my body
this foundation seriously is so ideal
for girls with dry skin I have dry skin
and I love it my face just drinks it up
and I'm getting a little sick so I
probably sound a little raspy it
honestly just takes no effort to blend
and the finish is just so fresh and dewy
and pretty I definitely see people with
oily skin not liking this because I mean
I'm do it but I think people from normal
to dry skin would really like this the
only thing I'm not too crazy about is
that it kind of stays just a little bit
tacky on the skin and that's usually
like a major pet peeve for me I cannot
deal with tacky foundations but I mean
it's to be expected with something so
glowy and dewy and if that bothers you
all you have to do is set this with a
powder and then you're good to go and it
takes away like the majority of the
tacky feeling so the next thing you do
is I go in with some concealer and today
I am using la girl Pro concealer and the
Maybelline fit me concealer I'm just
going to take the pro concealer and put
it right under Neath my eyes to cover
dark circles
this concealer has amazing coverage so I
like to use it with this foundation
because this foundation doesn't cover
like 100%
but I mean I would say it covers pretty
decently I don't have like super
problematic skin but I do have like
redness and uneven skin tone and it
covers pretty well I'm just going to add
a little bit of this concealer like this
and then I am taking this up into muffle
head to highlight and around my mouth to
cover up the veins I have I like to
blend this out with my Real Techniques
contour brush
oh one of my dogs farted hardcore whoa
that's pungent ah I'm gonna drag them up
onto my eyelids because I'm just doing a
foundation routine so I'm not going to
do much or anything to my eyes
what's so great about this Maybelline
fit me concealer is that it blends so
well honestly I use this as a foundation
all the time I'll take the shade 10 and
I'll put it on my entire face and use it
a foundation that was like my Holy Grail
foundation like a year ago it was
amazing I still do that and it's not as
dewy as the foundation so if you want
something less dewy but still love the
blendability I would use this all over
your face because it works amazingly
well by the way I'm not sponsored by
Maybelline I'm just a very big fan of
the fit me line I think it's so great
especially for us dry skinned girls I'm
going to take my ELF small tapered brush
and I'm going to set my under eye
concealer with this Mac emphasized
powder this is so great if you want like
a really like glowy looking skin because
it has like shimmers in it not like
crazy shimmers but it just makes your
under eye look nice and bright
I'm gonna take some and just brush it on
my eyelids
so now I'm going to work a little bit
more on that glow factor and I'm going
to add a liquid highlight or a cream
highlight and then go on top of it with
a powder highlight it's just gonna make
you look extra dewy and glowy I'm going
to use my bb+ illumination facial cream
by Gerard cosmetics I bought this myself
dry cosmetics did not send this to me
I heard crazy good things about this
stuff so I decided to buy it myself
because it's just right up my alley I
love illuminating creams and all that
good stuff but the packaging on this
sucks I feel like nobody comments on
that on how the packaging is so terrible
and I think it might be just me but when
I ordered it and I got it in the mail if
what the packaging was so bad that there
was cream leaking out so I emailed them
and I was like there's cream everywhere
it doesn't even pump out like the pump
was not working at all so they sent me
another one and I'm having the exact
same problem with the new one they sent
me
Natha so I have to take it out and apply
it to the back of my hand and then use
it that way which is a pain in my arse
but I deal with it because it is a
really pretty product so I'm just going
to take my ELF flawless concealer brush
and I'm going to dip it into that drug
cosmetics facial cream and I'm going to
apply this to the tops of my cheekbones
just a little bit on the bridge of my
nose and now I'm just going to go in
with some bronzer when I do will look
like this where it's very fresh-faced
and dewy I don't like to do that whole
contour thing I just want to give my
face a little bit of a bronze it's a
little bit of definition and I'm going
to be using my Sephora so the vio
bronzer I've gotten so many questions if
I still use this if I still like it and
yes it's probably one of my Holy Grail
bronzers but I don't like to use it in
videos because it was limited edition
and I don't want to upset anyone if you
can get your hands on this bronzer
someway somehow and you are like medium
to light skin tone do it is so good so
I'm going to take my Real Techniques
blush brush and I'm just going to add
some bronzer
I'm going to quickly curl my lashes I
know this is random doing this step now
but I'm just going to curl my lashes and
add some mascara okay so now it's my
absolute favorite part of this routine
and it is my highlighter my powder
highlighter I recently bought this not
too long ago and it has become my
ultimate obsession it is the positions
formula shimmer strip in natural nude so
I like to take my little Sigma contour
brush because it's the perfect size to
dip it right into these two little
squares right here at the top because it
has more of like a white gold and a gold
color and I love those white gold
champagne type of highlights so I'm just
going to dip my brush in and apply it to
my cheekbones
and right here takes them right here
okay so now after that I am pretty much
done but what I really like to do is
take my highlighting powder and a little
brush like this and add some to my brow
bone and I really like doing this
especially when I don't have any eye
makeup on because I just think it looks
so nice on its own and then I'll add it
right here and then I just add any
lipstick or lip gloss I'm using my NYX
butter gloss in Eclair and that's it I
didn't add blush to this look today
because it wasn't wearing blush in that
video I did when I was reviewing the
balm lip glosses but I just really
wanted to share this foundation routine
with you because it has been my go-to
foundation routine recently for going
out at night and stuff I really have
been loving super dewy fresh skin a
little bit thank you guys so much for
