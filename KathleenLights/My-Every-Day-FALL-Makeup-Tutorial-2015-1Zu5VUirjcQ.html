tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now
I cut myself cleaning my food processor
this morning so this is the look that
I've been wearing a lot recently just
not on my videos because as you guys
know I've been pre recording a lot but
I've worn this look three times in the
past week and that's saying a lot
because I like to like wear different
things but honestly I think this look is
perfect for fall if you are a simple gal
I think um we like to wear like a lot
less makeup in the summer and we really
glam it up in the fall time so I did a
little bit more than I would normally do
as an everyday look during the summer
this is a lot of makeup for some people
for an everyday look but I think it's
perfect for a fall because it's just
like a little bit vampy but natural at
the same time I don't know I really like
it and it's something that you can wear
all the time and just switch up the lip
color you could do a dark red a brown
mm-hmm I have wait I have had way too
much coffee today and I'm like you can't
tell okay so if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep watching
okay so I'm taking my hair out of my
face in my little headband here I'm
going to take the Smashbox BB water I'm
in the shade light you have to shake it
up first and then I'm applying this to
my face this is a Sephora Pro airbrush
brush I'm not exactly sure the name but
it was in that limited edition packaging
with the flowers so I'm just applying
that to my entire face I skip primer
when I use that because I find that I
don't really need to this is the
Maybelline uh what is this called the
better skin can see that there you go I
applied that underneath my eyes to
highlight and to cover up my circles and
then I applied that to the rest of my
face as I normally do this is the Sedona
lace 217 brush my holy grail concealer
brush and I'm just blending all of that
in
this is the it cosmetics bye bye porous
powder the pressed version I love this
so I'm just taking the Real Techniques
setting brush and I'm setting my under
eye concealer
now I'm going to move on to my eyes I'm
using the Maybelline 24-hour cream
eyeshadow in the shade creamy beige this
came out with like their leathers
collection but I still see it all the
time
and I'm just applying that to my entire
lid I just wanted a hint of color but
not something that was really noticeable
I like doing this for like an everyday
look and then I'm applying some of that
underneath my lower lashes with this
fluffy brush for mascara I'm using this
one by Clinique it's like their chubby
fat mascara but this is a red shade like
a red color and I think it's so cool
like so nice for a fall because it's a
deep cranberry shade and you can tell it
just gives like a slight hint
you can't tell unless you look really
close but I think it's cool so now to
finish up my face that's all I do with
the eyes I'm using the elf mineral
bronzer and I'm going to use this to
contour I don't exactly remember the
name of this brush but it's like a
morphe blush brush now I'm going to
apply some blush this is like a bronzer
and blush in one this is benefits Dallas
box powder blush thing it's like a
really pretty mouth color it's so nice
this time of year I always bust it out
in the fall time it's beautiful so for
highlight I'm using Becca's champagne
pop and I'm just barely putting this on
the tops of my cheekbones I don't want
to look too glowy
but just a little bit of
something-something and now I'm moving
on to my lips and this is the star of
the show you can change up your lip
color for an everyday because this eye
look goes with everything but this is
color pops lippy stick in the shade
grunge and then that completes this
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
