a talk through video I haven't done one
of these in a while I don't think I
usually do voiceovers but today I will
be showing you my everyday makeup
routine and I used the term everyday
loosely cuz if you follow me on snapchat
you know mama hardly wears makeup I mean
most of the time I'm home I am a I'm a
homebody I'm home all the time and if
I'm just home I'm gonna gnomic I'd like
to walk around with makeup unless I'm
filming a lot of the times I will film
in the morning and then just wear the
makeup for the rest of the day and I'm
perfectly fine with that
but if I'm not filming if I'm just
relaxing I've done a makeup on and I do
have a video that went up not too long
ago but I will link down below it is my
minimal makeup look like the no makeup
makeup that is when I want to do like
the bare minimum like barely any makeup
if you're more interested in that kind
of video I will link that below this
video I'm putting on makeup and this is
the look I've been doing a lot recently
which is why I wanted to film it this is
the look I like to wear when I want to
try it just a little bit when I don't
want to do with the bare minimum I want
to do something a little bit extra it's
a very very fresh face no eye makeup
just very fresh and I love it I hope you
guys enjoyed this look and if you want
to see how to get it even though it's
very simple oh my god I choked on my
saliva then just keep on watching it's
so crazy to see like my hair shorter
even though it's not even that much
shorter but it was like down to here so
I cut off like like this much I have to
wash my hair today so it's like really
gross so let's ignore that anyway I've
already moisturized my face when I did
my skincare routine earlier and I
applied a little bit of the Josie Maran
Argan daily moisturizer SPF 47 because I
think I'm going to be out today in the
Sun this is my favorite face SPF it's a
physical SPF I love it forever now I'm
going to apply some of this guy to my
face this is a
gotcha luminous dewy skin mist this is
my favorite facial mist ever ever ever
ever okay so that mist has completely
like dried its completely in my skin and
you can see how crazy like most facial
sprays when I spray it and then it dries
it just gives me a little bit of
luminosity but it doesn't look as dewy
as this and my skin actually feels super
like moisturized like if I just put on a
cream or like a moisturizer it's crazy
it feels so hydrated uh-huh so now I'm
going to work on the brows I'm actually
doing my eyebrows on camera I never do
my eyebrows on camera just because it
takes forever but I'm not doing anything
too crazy I'm going to use the elf
instant lift brow pencil I have mine in
neutral brown somebody actually told me
that there's came at the top did like
mine just not come with the top so weird
so yeah I'm just gonna come zebra
okay so um I do like my eyebrows to look
a little bit lighter than this just to
kind of I don't know just a little bit
like I'm going to use the laurio brow
stylist plumper for all gel mascara I'm
actually using light to medium instead
of medium to dark because they look a
little bit dark for me like for an
everyday thing so I'm just gonna like
lighten them up a little bit and this is
obviously going to set my eyebrow hairs
in place this stuff does not move I love
this eek
okay so that is all I'm doing to my
brows usually if I'm going out at night
I will like carve them out a little bit
more make them a little bit more like
sculpted and more perfect UPS is here
some people might think that this is
even too bold but you guys know I like
bold eyebrows so I don't like to put on
foundation all the time honestly I have
so many foundations and I wear
foundations if I'm going somewhere like
oh like a pimple if someone's like hey
let go somewhere and do something
important then I'll put on foundation
but if I'm going to you get me I don't
wear foundation every day okay focus so
I love using these products on a regular
like day to day basis these are the
Maybelline fit me concealer I love them
I'm going to use ten light like on my
face a little bit and then 15 fair
underneath my eyes so what I like to do
with number 10 as you can see I need to
buy a new one I haven't found this
number in a while like it's starting to
worry me I just like dot it around like
that like really weird like that like a
circle on my face
I know super strange but I only put a
little bit just to barely even out my
skin tone and then I take the 15 fair
and that is what I used for under what I
use for underneath my eyes they're
flying here and I bring this one around
my nose on the bridge of my nose and in
between my forehead I mean in between my
eyebrows I always say in between my
forehead around my mouth I get like
redness around my mouth and then I just
blend that all in and that kind of looks
a little bit heavy or like you might as
well just wear foundation but it feels
so lightweight it really isn't as heavy
as a foundation so I'm using the
sculpting brush by Real Techniques I
freaking love this brush I've talked
about it in a favorites video it's
amazing
amazing get your hands on it it's
fantastic and I like to use it on a day
that I'm in a rush this brush because in
a rush this brush because it's big
enough to be like a foundation brush
like you just blend out your foundation
perfectly but then because of the way
it's shaped it's so easy to just get in
between my eyebrows and then underneath
my eyes like this
see it's fantastic I'm going to take
this concealer on my eyes as well just
to cover up any meaning I have very very
very veiny
eyelids when I was younger actually
people make fun people made fun of my
eyelids because they were so veiny and
actually my forehead as well I used to
have crazy veins on my forehead I mean I
still kind of do but not as much
not as bad and also this concealer is
very luminous um and fresh it's not
cakey it doesn't dry out my under eyes
it's seriously like fabulous so as you
can tell like you can still see my skin
but it just looks a little bit more even
like around my face here I'm gonna set
that because right now I just look crazy
like a little breezy breezy I'm going to
use my NYX HD finishing powder normally
I would use my Maybelline powder but I'm
trying to switch it up because I always
use that one so I'm using this NYX one
to set my under eyes and I actually
really really like this powder I think
it's really good huh just got a little
rush sure I am seriously a mess unless
I'm filming voiceovers that's why I
always film voiceovers but anyway trying
something different today betting the
concealer on my lids because I'm not it
like creases so yeah
I'm also going to set right here
okay so now for my favorite product ever
this is very very pricey but honestly
guys like this is the best makeup item I
own it's my favorite makeup product this
is the Charlotte Tilbury film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow I love this I love this so
much the fact that I love them both the
same is crazy because sometimes I don't
like the highlights in a contour kit or
the contour is in the high but you know
what I mean so I love these both so much
and and this is the perfect shade to
contour with but it's also the perfect
shade to bronze with so I'm going to
take the morphe mb5 it's just a
stippling brush I like to use any stick
stippling brush I like the Sephora one -
it doesn't matter so I'm just gonna dip
this brush into my sculpt one bronzer
and I'm gonna start bronzing my skin
honestly um a lot of the times I don't
even put on concealer on my face I don't
put anything on my face I just conceal
my under eyes and throw this bronzer on
because I think it looks beautiful even
on bare skin and that's really hard to
come across because sometimes bronzers
will look patchy unless you have a base
underneath not this one Oh
I love this bronzer so much I'm gonna
put some under here as well my neck a
little bit just a little bit it just
makes you look nice and glowy and can
you guess it
Jennifer Lizzie okay so typically I
would just go ahead and use the
highlight in this palette because it's
like my favorite but I have been
obsessed with the Becca champagne pop
this is the collaboration with Jaclyn
hill and I'm not just saying that
because I love Jacqueline hell but this
is my favorite Becca highlight that
Jacqueline sent it to me but I went out
and bought it the second I tried it so I
have a backup because it's honestly my
favorite Becca highlight and my favorite
has always been moonstone but I like
this one more because it's not as like
stark I don't know it's freaking awesome
if you can get your hands on it still
get your hands so now I'm just going to
highlight the crap out of my face using
champagne pop this is an elf small
tapered brush
I'm using that same brush to just like
blend things in mainly focusing on the
top of my cheeks cheeks bones but I'll
feel like you know highlighting on my
own face
ready on my nose I don't like to
highlight the very tip of my nose I know
a lot of people do but I'm not a fan I'm
just gonna like my chin a little bit
and yeah I just want to keep
highlighting but I need to control
myself and then that's everything I do
for my face like on a day-to-day basis I
like very bronzy skin and highlight I
don't like to blush you guys know that
unless I'm like going out so I have been
obsessed with this lipstick since the
day I got it this is the Mac huggable
lip color and this is in the shade soft
talkin it was sold out at like two
counters when I went to go get it but I
ended up buying it online it was
available online I don't know if it
still is but I love this lipstick
because it's super super moisturizing
but it stays on it's like the weirdest
thing I don't know what formula this is
like I don't know I swear those lights
were like a lot brighter at the
beginning of this video I am really
really impressed with the formula of
this lipstick because it's really
hydrating but it doesn't slip or bleed
and I'm feeling it
oh my god I didn't promise Carol I'll do
that
it is a sheer color but I think it's
beautiful I also really love wearing
this on top of a lip liner like I will
flow my entire lips with a lip liner and
then put this on top and the combination
of like a matte lip liner and this is
fab it's like fantastic I wore it out at
night recently like that combo and it my
lips were glossy the whole night anyway
that was soft talking I like it so I'm
gonna put our mascara on my favorites
everyday like basic mascara is the
Maybelline colossal volume express not
it's not basic but I like how it makes
my lashes look without any eyeshadow on
again okay so that completes this look
pretty much this is what I will wear if
I'm like you know what I want to do a
little something with my makeup but not
go all out and then after I will just
spray my face not necessarily with the
touch of this bottle or somebody not
with this one again cuz it's super dewy
so I'll go in with a different spray
today I'm going to use the coconut or
the lavender I have like an addiction to
facial mists I just bought this one from
josie maran it's the Nirvana hydrating
treatment for no reason I didn't need
this I have like an addiction to facial
mist oh my god would you guys like to
see a video on all my facial mists as
like a makeup sash let me know I know
it's super stupid so maybe you guys
don't want to so I'm gonna do coconut
and I'm just gonna spray
I know I let that dry maybe it was a
little too close to my face and now we
are officially done this may be too dewy
and too luminous for some people but
honestly when you have really dry skin
and mine is kind of flaky you want to
look as dooley as you can actually I
think I'm going to add some highlights
to my inner corners this is the makeup
geek defined crease brush yeah let's do
it a little bit under here all right I
like it no regrets thank you guys so
much for watching this video I hope you
enjoyed it I know it's super basic and
simple and like cool like you did
nothing but I honestly just wanted to
show you my everyday kind of makeup
routine please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
