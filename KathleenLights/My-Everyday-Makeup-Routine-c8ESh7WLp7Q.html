my everyday makeup routine now keep in
mind I don't wear makeup everyday but
when I do wear makeup on days where I
don't really want to try so hard this is
what I do so it doesn't matter if I'm
just putting on tinted moisturizer or
what I always have to prime my face
because just covers my pores really well
and my foundation glides on so much
smoother when I have primer on
and that's a really dirty mirror girl
yeah now taking my Revlon nearly naked
foundation I'm in the shade nude and my
Real Techniques expert face brush I am
just going to be picking up my hair and
then putting this all over my face I
wasn't a big fan of this foundation when
I first got it because I applied too
much and I know that sounds really weird
because the Revlon nearly naked is
supposed to be you know thin and light
and stuff but it it wasn't for me it
caked up a lot and it wasn't good so I
learned that with just a thin layer it
does look nicely and I ended up loving
this foundation it when I learned how to
put it on my face so I'm just applying a
very thin layer of this foundation all
over my face just kind of even out my
skin tone
next I go in with my Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm gonna try to show you
yeah you can't see what it's called but
it's the lightest shade and I'm going to
be putting this around my nose and
around my mouth and in between my
eyebrows where I have a lot of redness
and I think I've found my Holy Grail
concealer because for the first time I
have found a concealer that doesn't take
up around my nose I get a lot of redness
around my nose and this concealer
doesn't look terrible like all the other
containers I've tried and now I'm saying
next I'm just going to be combing my
eyebrows so I'm taking the spoolie in my
Anastasia brow Wiz and I'm just going to
be combing my eyebrows now eyebrows are
looking quite gray you don't even
I'm taking max cork and a stiff angled
eyeliner brush I guess and I'm just
going to be
filling them in now the amazing woman
who does my eyebrows and shapes them and
waxes them and cuts them and does all
that good stuff lives in Miami where I
grew up and where my entire family is
and ever since she touched my eyebrows
for some reason I cannot let anyone else
do them so I kind of try to do it myself
just pluck the hairs that come out and I
do them whenever I go down but they're
little hairy scary so bear with me now
I'm taking my Maybelline Color tattoo
and barely branded and I'm just gonna be
popping this on my lids
I usually go for a shadow base that has
some sort of color to it like Mac's
painterly paint-pot
or my NYX skin tone base just because I
need something to get rid of those crazy
veins I have on my eyelids so that's
what I'm doing now
now I take my handy-dandy quad this is
an elf quad and i depotted Mac
eyeshadows in it and here I keep kind of
like my most worn neutral shades I'm
going to take this reddish brown color
called saddle and I'm just going to be
putting this into my crease with my
Sigma e-40 brush
this is literally the look I wear all
the time
when I don't even know where I'm going
or what we're doing just to throw some
makeup on and I know that everything
still looks put together but it was fast
and easy I'm also going to be taking
that color on a pencil brush and putting
that on my lower lash line
next taking this pink champagne a color
called all that glitters and my ELF just
regular eyeshadow brush I'm going to put
this all over my lid
not much thought goes into this part I
just take this eyeshadow and literally
put it everywhere past the crease it
doesn't really matter this is the
perfect eye shadow because it looks good
with everything and it looks good on its
own it's perfect
now I'm taking that pale pink color it's
called orb and I'm gonna be using this
as my highlight under my brow bone and
in my tear duct area
now taking my Maybelline instant age
rewind dark circle eraser I'm going to
be covering up those dark under eye
circles now usually do a step right
before this but on days like these where
I don't really want to try so hard I'll
just do this and it'll be fine
here's my bags are a little too dark and
they need a little bit more work but
it's fine like this
I'm going to set my makeup with my mac
fix+ because Mac skin is so dry that I
cannot use powder sometimes sometimes I
do when I'm feeling extra moisturized
but on Days Around to dry powder is not
my friend taking my Maybelline master oh
that felt my Maybelline master drama
eyeliner and my wet and wild mega volume
I'm just gonna line my waterline and my
tight line and put on just one thin coat
of mascara I'm not gonna pile on this
mascara like I'm going to a party or
anything it's just to give my lashes
some sort of full look but not too crazy
taking my Sigma stippling brush I don't
remember what theme of it is right now
and my Mac bronzer now it is a little
broken so yeah I use this bronzer on
days where I'm not trying to contour at
all I'm not trying to do anything crazy
because it does have shimmers in it but
it gives such a nice bronze glow and I
love it so I just literally pop that
everywhere now I'm going to take my
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stain
this is in the colored charm I've been
obsessed with this and I'm gonna put
that on my lips
and I start to laugh at the face I'm
making I'm such a loser
this changes every time I do my makeup
my lip color but I always go for like a
light muted peachy pink color but I've
been obsessed with these kissable balm
stains I'm really late on the kissable
balm saying train but it just looks so
good and they stain your lips they
really do in they last all day so on
days you don't really want to try with
your makeup you don't really want to
apply lipstick or lip gloss over and
over again so the fact that this is a
stain as well is awesome thank you for
watching guys I hope you enjoyed please
subscribe for more videos and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
