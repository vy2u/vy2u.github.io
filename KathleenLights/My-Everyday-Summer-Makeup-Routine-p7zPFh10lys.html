my everyday summer makeup routine it's a
kind of makeup look I go for when I
don't really want to try but I do have
to go somewhere because honestly I don't
wear makeup every single day if I'm just
going to go to like Walmart or Target or
Walgreens or something like that
I usually don't have makeup on but this
is the kind of look I've been wearing
recently to go late to the movies with
my friends or like to the park or
something like that places like that
where you want to wear minimal makeup
but still look you know somewhat done
you got me but yeah this has been my
go-to summer look recently and I really
like it so I hope you do too and if you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep watching okay so before I get
started two things I want to point out
one I'm not naked I am wearing a romper
and it's a strapless romper um so I look
naked bum up and to the pimple is not up
for discussion
I know it's large and in charge and it's
been there for like a month almost I'm
exaggerating a little bit hasn't been a
month that's been there for like two
weeks like just like right in my face
like hello Kathleen good morning and I'm
like oh you still here anyway I usually
always do my eyebrows off of camera
because it takes forever to do them but
for the sake of this video since I'm
doing like a talk through video and
stuff like that usually do voiceovers I
might as well just go ahead and show you
guys how I found my eyebrows even though
I have done this a couple of times but
the first thing I do is I take my
Anastasia brow Wiz and just brush out my
brows my brows are so hairy scary right
now because I haven't done them in like
three weeks I use the shade brunette by
the way I know it is really dark but I
actually like it because I go over it
with like a warmer powder so I like that
it's dark so I just start creating
little strokes
I just follow the natural shape of my
eyebrow and just make it a little bit
bolder
so then after that I like to put a
powder on top because my hair has a lot
of warmth to it so I like to kind of
match up with my hair so for that I use
the eyeshadow by Mac called cork is like
my Holy Grail I shadow for my brows I
use it all the time and I use this brush
right here I actually got this at
Michael's it is from royal and
langnickel and it is just a really like
stiff flat brush and it is perfect for
your eyebrows I know that Mac and Sigma
sell brushes that have this shape but
this was $2.00 at Michaels and it works
like a charm so basically just fill this
in by going right over the Anastasia
brow Wiz
and then when I get to the front of my
brow I just rub it like this to make it
look like it's a little bit faded
towards the front then what I like to do
is set my eyebrows I don't do this all
the time but if I'm going to be wearing
this makeup all day and I'm going to be
in the Sun and stuff like that I do like
to set my eyebrows and I use the Milani
brow shaping clear dome just regular
brow gel and then this also brushes my
eyebrow hairs in place okay so now I
just move on to the rest of my face I
have been using my booboo cover-up
concealer a lot lately I got this in my
Ipsy bag I don't wear foundation on a
daily basis unless I have somewhere to
go or I really have something to do an
event a party or something like that
then I'll put on foundation I just like
to conceal anything that needs
concealing so lately I've been using my
booboo cover-up and I'm just going to
take some of that and apply it right on
I'm gonna call him Arthur
right on big Arthur now this pimple is
so big that no amount of concealer in
the world could probably cover it but we
do the best we can
and then any little redness or small
little bumps I have
I like to conceal the area around my
mouth because I have a really big purple
vein it kind of goes from like my neck
all the way up to my mouth it's a little
annoying so I just cover that up
so after I do that I do like to use
concealer underneath my eyes and I also
use the same concealer but first I like
to add my benefit stay don't stray this
is a primer for concealer and for your
eyes so I like to put this right
underneath my eyes to prime for the
concealer and I use this a lot when I
need my concealer to last all day so if
I'm gonna be in the Sun and in the
summertime where you're sweating a lot
and I get a lot of creasing underneath
my eyes this prevents some of the
creasing actually I think we'll get a
full size of this I really like this and
then I apply it to my eyes as well
and then I just wrote that it
and the reason I put this on my eyelids
as well is because I have a lot of veins
on my eyes like a lot of them and then
this conceals most of them and then I go
in with concealer and i'm using the same
booboo cover-up and if i'm doing a full
face of makeup then I will bring the
concealer down in the triangle shape to
highlight but when it's dated and it's
minimal makeup I just focus on covering
the dark circles then I will quickly go
ahead and set with a powder this
concealer is amazing but it does settle
into my fine lines unless I set it
quickly so I'm just going to take my
Maybelline fit me powder and 135 creamy
natural and on just a regular brush this
is the expert face brush from Real
Techniques I'm just going to set that
and I'm going to set my eyelids as well
and then whatever is left on my brush
I'll just set
the rest of the concealer so on a
day-to-day basis when I want minimal
make-up like today I do not put on eye
shadow eyeliner or anything like that I
just slept on some mascara and I tend to
go for a really bold maizing mascara
when I do this so I have been loving my
Mac in extreme dimension 3d lash I
believe it's called 3d black lash
mascara this is what it looks like and I
love it so I'm just going to apply this
to my eye lashes
okay so once I'm done with my scare my
face is a little bit paler than my body
right now because I didn't put on
foundation and I have self-tanner on so
my face is always wider than my body but
I just use some bronzer to bronze it up
and the bronzer I'm using is my Sephora
so the vio bronzer and I just take it on
my Real Techniques blush brush and just
start runs in up my face
I kind of just put this everywhere just
to make myself look a little bit bronzed
e'er on my face I love how the smell was
like babies like beautiful little babies
okay so after I've done that I'm taking
my a cosmetics blush brush and my pixie
bronzer in suddely Sun touched and I
kind of use it as a blush so as you can
see it's like a really pink bronzer so
pretty in the summertime because it's
brontë so I just take some of that and
I put it on my cheeks then I just put on
some chapstick or lip gloss today I'm
going to be using the NYX butter gloss
in maple blondie it's like a corally
pink super pretty for summer and I love
these things
so much
okay and then I'm just going to set
everything and I'm going to use my Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray it's
cooling and hydrating which is great for
me
okay guys so then that completes this
look this is my everyday summer makeup
routine or this look whenever I need
something simple and fast and I know
it's going to work for me I really hope
