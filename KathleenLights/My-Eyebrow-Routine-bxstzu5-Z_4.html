my eyebrow routine and I have been
promising that I was going to this video
for a very long time and honestly I
didn't really want to do this video at
first just because I feel like my
eyebrow routine is so incredibly basic
that this video might bore you to death
but it was requested a ton so I'm gonna
do it anyway which is why I have one
eyebrow done and one not so done now
before I start showing you the actual
process I go through I do want to
mention a couple things I'm going to be
showing you how I pluck my eyebrows and
how I cut them so they can stay this
shape and then - am in and stuff like
that actually didn't shake my eyebrows
myself I went to the salon and got them
shaped because my eyebrows were very
very scary before I started going to a
salon I had like an arch like a
ridiculous arch I had like a lot of hair
at the top and I just didn't want to
mess with that myself so I went to a
salon and got them done at the salon and
honestly the reason why I just started
doing it myself is because I no longer
live in Miami and the woman who does my
eyebrows lives in Miami the salon is in
Miami so basically what I've been doing
is just maintaining the shape that she
created which is what I'm going to be
showing you in this video I haven't
gotten my eyebrows done um
professionally like at the salon since
January so it's gonna be almost a year
that I got them done wow I haven't been
to Miami since
right by the way I know there's a bunch
of girls who watch my videos that are
from Miami and if you want to get your
eyebrows done amazingly well I suggest
going to the dragonfly's spot in Miami
Lakes she does a phenomenal job on
eyebrows I cannot stress it enough that
is the best place to go get your
eyebrows done if you live in that area
like she she's an angel she really is
that woman is an angel but yeah I just
quickly wanted to mention that in this
video because they're pretty much
already shaped the way I want them to I
just kind of trim them and cut them and
keep them looking as nice as I possibly
can I know that you can buy stencils
that you just put on your eyebrow and
then you trim around it I recommend
doing that if you don't want to go to a
salon they have the anastasia stencil
they're really good and I know that Too
Faced has like an eyebrow kit that's
really good and so the Sigma and they
come with stencils so you can try using
stencils if the shape of your eyebrow is
just not framing your face very well or
you just don't like to trim your
eyebrows so yeah now that I've blabbed
on for about half an hour I'm going to
go ahead and get started on my eyebrow
routine okay so I always start by
plucking my eyebrows first all the
little hairs to start to grow here and
on top you know what I'm talking about
so the UM would you call this tweezer
the tweezer I use is the one from Revlon
I've purchased this one multiple times
it's my favorite one to just get at the
drugstore I know that tweezerman is
really good I think they I don't know if
they sell that at the drugstore but I
actually prefer the Revlon one I don't
know what it is but I feel like it grips
my hairs a lot better than any other
tweezer I've ever used so I use the
Revlon one basically I just start
plucking all the hairs that are growing
under here and the ones that um
are growing on top as well
anyway I don't recommend plucking on the
outside of your eyebrows unless you
absolutely want to I just think that
short eyebrows aren't they just don't
look good on me
so I keep the length I always keep the
length on my eyebrows no matter what so
anyway after I do that I go and I
trimmed the hairs because my eyebrows
grow very fast so I have it gets really
bushy really quickly so I go and I trim
them I don't do this very often I do
this probably like once every two weeks
maybe every 10 days around there I don't
know I do pluck them pretty often like
every two days I pluck them just to
maintain the shape
so yeah the scissors that I use to trim
my hair are also from Revlon these are
eyebrows is errs there specifically for
cutting the hairs on your eyebrows I
love these Revlon ones I just really
like the Revlon eyebrow products
apparently these scissors came in a
little package with a spoolie like this
these two came together I got it at
Target and these are awesome I don't use
this fully for my eyebrows just because
I use the spoolie on my brows for my
eyebrows actually use this to comb all
my mascara sometimes but I'm just
letting you know that it does come with
a spoolie and this fully does work
perfectly fine so after I pluck them I
just take my spoolie and I brush the
hairs up and you look a little crazy at
first but that is just the easiest way
to cut them by the way excuse my eyebrow
I just want to add a little disclaimer
just in case somebody mentioned
something I do recommend going to a
salon if you want to get your eyebrows
done professionally and nicely but I
really don't trust many people with my
eyebrows so I try to do it myself if
you're someone who does eyebrows you're
probably looking at me
girl that is not how you're supposed to
do it but this is the way like I said
that works for me I told you it's a
weird way but this is how I do them so I
just wanted to add a little disclaimer
you know just in case so any once I
brush my hair up I just take my little
eyebrow scissors and I cut the hairs
that are standing up at the top the ones
are just too long I cut those and I do
this as careful as possible because you
don't want to cut your eyebrows off
okay so now I just fill them in I know a
lot of people don't like the term their
eyebrows they just kind of put them in
place and then just use like a brow gel
like a wax but I don't use those things
because I feel like I don't need to
since I trim them the eyebrow brush I
use is just this angled brush from
Coastal Scents it's like they're big
angled brush and I use a Mac eyeshadow
called cork to fill them in this is like
a warmer brown color just because I feel
like it matches my hair pretty well so I
always use this I did actually use the
Anastasia brow Wiz all the time and I
absolutely love this but I do like using
powder just a little bit more but I
definitely recommend the Anastasia brow
Wiz if you're not into using powders if
you like more like a pencil oh and by
the way I don't like very strong bold
looking eyebrows a couple people have
commented on my videos telling me that I
need to fill them in more but I
personally don't like the strong brow
look I like it
just how I do it that's how I like it so
I start out at the bottom right here
and basically just follow the shape
and drag it up
and then I do the top part right here
and then when I do like the tail I know
what's my collar fail but this half of
my eyebrow I just add a little bit more
product
you
and for the front part of my eyebrow I
like it to be very blow now kind of like
a bit fades in the front so I just take
it like this I don't add any additional
powder and I just kind of blend
everything just to let it look a little
blown out and faded like that I just
don't like a very harsh like square at
the front so now it looks a little bit
too intense I just take my little
spoolie and brush it and make it look a
little bit more natural okay guys so
that's it this was my eyebrow beam this
routine isn't for everybody and it's
just basically about personal preference
how you like to fill in your eyebrows
how you like to shape them this is the
way that I like my eyebrows just my
personal way of doing it so I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
