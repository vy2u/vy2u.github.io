my current favorite Holy Grail face
brushes I've done videos like this in
the past but I don't think I've done a
video dedicated to brushes in like over
ten months so I thought I would do one
today
strictly face brushes though because as
I was pulling out all of my favorite
brushes I brushes and face brushes it
was like a ton of them I have so many
favorite eye brushes that was the issue
there my eye brushes because I have so
many that I love so I thought I would do
a whole video dedicated to my favorite
eye brushes like my favorite blending
brushes and favorite pencil brushes and
there's just so many you know so I
thought I would do a part two and
dedicate it to my favorite eye brushes
so let me know about something honestly
but for today we're going to be talking
about my favorite face brushes now I
have about three videos on my channel
where I'm talking about brushes and two
out of the three are dedicated to like
drugstore and affordable brushes so I
thought in today's video I would mainly
stick to high-end brushes if you would
like me to do a drugstore version of
this definitely let me know even though
I've done them in the past you know um
you know but today I'm going to be
focusing on brushes that you cannot find
at the drugstore one of these are
actually a morphe brush but I think even
when I do part two I'm going to include
morphe brushes in that because yes they
are affordable but they are in drugstore
so if I do do a drug store dedicated
brush video I want it to be like
strictly drugstore brushes you know you
can't get morphe at the drugstore so my
part two for eye brushes will include a
few more feet brushes in that even
though they're mainly high-end but
anyway today we're going to talk about
my current Holy Grail face brushes these
can change all the time I'm always
discovering new stuff but right now at
the moment these are my must-haves and
yeah I think I'm going to go ahead and
get started now I'm going to do this in
the order I would normally do my face so
like foundation concealer bronzer blush
I'll eat you don't you know in that
order so let's jump in so when it comes
to foundation I like to use foundation
brushes from time to time but honestly
there's nothing I could recommend more
than a beauty sponge a Beauty Blender
any kind of makeup sponge these happen
to be my favorite the first one being
the original Beauty Blender mind
like a really dirty because I used it
today you could purchase this at Sephora
in my opinion nothing applied my
foundation as flawlessly and as
beautiful as a Beauty Blender I think it
has a lot to do with the fact that I
have really dry skin and just applying
foundation with a damp make sure stamp a
damp Beauty Blender I guess the
combination of like the damp Beauty
Blender and the foundation it just
pushes the product into your skin and it
looks so natural and it just never looks
cakey it looks beautiful I will say
there are certain foundations that don't
apply really well with the Beauty
Blender sometimes the Beauty Blender
will shear out the coverage a little bit
too much so then I'll use a brush but
for the most part I just really love the
look of a Beauty Blender I also really
love the sponge from pure cosmetics and
I love this equal tool sponge which of
this you can totally get at the
drugstore but I just wanted to mention
it because out of all the drugstore
sponges I've tried I think this Ecotools
one is my absolute favorite there are
some sponges on the market that don't
really give me a swamis finish some are
too stiff some just soak up all of the
foundation the key is finding the
perfect Beauty sponge and these three
are my favorite and I highly recommend
applying your foundation with a sponge
especially if you have dry skin but when
I am applying my foundation with a brush
I truly love this 1 by 8 cosmetics and I
only want to mention it really quick
just to show you it's my favorite
because it was limited edition and it
makes me so sad because I love this so
much this is the love is the foundation
brush I think it was exclusive to Ulta
and it came out for breast cancer
awareness and I love it it just presses
the foundation into the skin so nicely
and it always looks awesome the only
other brush that I love almost as much
as that one is this guy right here it's
from Marc Jacobs and it is the face 2
brush now I wanted to mention this today
because there are a few Marc Jacobs
brushes that I don't think are worth the
money because as you know they are very
very expensive very expensive but some
of them I do truly think they're worth
the splurge and this happens to be one
of them
I love the angle on this brush it just
applies foundation so well it just
pushes the product right into the skin
and it never looks like it's sitting on
top of the skin it just blends the
foundation in perfectly I love this
of this I feel like I can like tap in my
foundations no matter how you use this
brush you always get a nice finish and I
also really love but you can get right
into like the corners of your nose up
underneath your eyes because of this
shape it's extremely soft
it never sheds on me I've watched this a
million times and it just happens to be
one of those Marc Jacobs brushes that I
think is really worth it I'm still sad
because there are three brushes in this
video that were limited-edition and you
can't get them anymore but I still want
to mention them because they're honestly
my favorite and I just want to share
them with you I'll mention them really
quickly though I promise the rest of
these are available at all times when it
comes to blending out my under-eye
concealer I mean nine times out of ten
if I'm applying my foundation with this
I'll just go ahead and apply my
concealer with this side but if I'm not
using this sponge I am mostly using this
guy this is a brush from Tarte I don't
even know what the name of this is it
came out I think for the rainforest of
the sea collection I just love the shape
of this I love how it's angled and I
love that it's not fluffy it's a very
dense brush so it does a great job of
really buffing out that concealer and
really blending it into the skin and I
just love how you can get right up in
the corners and then just really clean
up your eyeshadow on the outer corners
with this I just love this and I just
haven't been able to find anything I
like as much as this I use other stuff
that I like as well but this it just
it's my favorite if you know of any
brush that is pretty much exactly like
this leave me a comment down below I
would love to check it out my temples
are sending my under-eye concealer I
have used a ton of different brushes and
honestly I really could set my under
eyes with just pretty much anything but
my favorite brush hands-down for some
reason is this guy this is the Smith one
one two brush and ever since I purchased
this I have to sum using this to set my
under eye can see there you see me use
in my videos all the time I just love
house offices it never scratches my
under eye have you ever tried to set
your under eye concealer but the brush
is like pinching your under eye this
never does that to me it's a very soft
brush and I love the shape of it it's
the perfect size for underneath my eyes
I just swirl it around in some power and
boom boo-boom boo-boom boo-boom boo-boom
done and I also use this to set the rest
of my face as you see me do a hundred
times because I'm always too lazy to
grab another brush but I love love love
this
okay let's talk about bronzer brushes I
feel like for a long time I was on the
hunt for a perfect bronzer brush and I
think that on the brush that I've used
the most and I'm not just talking on
camera like remember I only post three
videos a week on my channel and they're
not always tutorial so you're not always
seeing me use brushes but I got to say
my favorite bronzer brush hands-down has
to be this bad boy right here this is
the way of a 90 luxe grand powder brush
I love this because of its shape it gets
thinner here on its side so it kind of
looks like an oval and it's just the
perfect shape to really bronze up the
skin I'm not talking about contouring
I'm talking about simply warming up the
complexion this is the perfect size
because it's not too big and it's also
not too small and it's so similar to so
many other really pricey brushes on the
market the whele is such a great brand I
have washed this a trillion times and
yeah I mean there's like little hairs
flaring out on the sides here but it
doesn't shed on me it stays intact and I
use this all the time I take it with me
traveling throw one in my bag like it
it's a strong little guy I actually
think this is a great dupe for that
ridiculously priced tomforde brush which
I happen to own let me show it to you
really quick this is the ridiculously
overpriced Tom Ford bronzer brush and I
don't even like this I purchased this
because it had rave reviews and in my
opinion it's just too big I mean you can
use it but in my opinion it's a little
bit too stiff for me it's not hard like
the bristles are extremely soft like
very very very soft it's just a little
bit too dense for me this one is a
little bit more flimsy so I feel like it
blends out the bronzer a lot better
versus this I feel like you kind of
makes my browser look a little bit
patchy when I try to blend this on my
face I kind of feel like bronzer goes
all over my cheek and because it's so
dense I find that I don't really blend
it so well maybe that's just me maybe I
don't know how to apply bronzer but I
find this to be pretty difficult to work
with and that makes so much money for
this and I don't even use it I much
prefer my Zoe one I even like how it's
smaller like look at the difference
there pretty much the exact same brush
only one is a bit smaller and I just
honestly I prefer the smaller one it's
just just way better I don't know I
definitely recommend this one Oh more
than
one okay so when it comes to contouring
my face there is one brush that I truly
love and I kind of have like a love-hate
relationship with this guy and this is
the NARS Yap cheeto kabuki brush I
believe that's how you saying yaki oh
I'm not exactly sure I apologize but I
love this brush it's so perfect to
contour with because it literally comes
to the perfect little point so when you
dip your brush into the bronzer if the
majority of the product lays right here
and when you put it here in the hollows
of the cheeks so for so surrounding the
point just blend it out so flawlessly
yet you get a very precise contoured
look like it's perfect to cut both
cheeks but yet not one of those
contouring brushes that's like literally
like a line those brushes are not a huge
fan of like the ones that come in like
the benefit hoola box or that really
famous NARS eita brush I don't really
love that I feel like it gives me too
much of a harsh contour I like my cheeks
to be really defined but not like too
much I don't love that look I like
something diffused but structured and I
feel like this gives that to me the
perfect shape I love everything about
this except this is like a mouthful all
my gosh for as much as I pay for this
this shouldn't be shedding that much
even when I'm applying my contour
sometimes I'm like blending onto my face
and I'll have like a little black hair
right here and I'm like what that's the
only complaint I have with this guy but
besides that it is my contouring best
friend okay so I have found my Holy
Grail face powder brush whenever I want
to apply powder foundation or any kind
of face powder I will always grab this
guy I'm obsessed with this this is the a
cosmetics number two to five complexion
powder brush and it is absolutely
everything I don't know what it is about
this brush that makes me love it so much
I love the size of it I feel like I'm
really extreme either I am setting my
face with this little thing or I'm
setting my face with this bad boy
honestly mainly I use this for like
powder foundations for example it's like
something like this this is my Giorgio
Armani luminous soap powder foundation
boom boom boom and then I'll just apply
this to my entire face and I set my face
in like seconds it's so big it's so
fluffy it is so soft but you just want
to apply like stuff to your face with
this because it is kind of dense like
it's not something that's really flimsy
it's not something
just going to dust powder on your face
no no this is going to give you some
coverage because it's going to pick up a
lot of the product but it's going to
push it right into the skin and it's
going to give you a really nice finish
to the face I love this i'm so sad
because my favorite blush brush was
limited edition and it is this this is a
brush from Tarte you can just see me use
it a few times it was another one of
those like rainforest of the supership
I think I don't know and it's just a
giant giants like tapered highlighter
kind of brush but I use this for blush
like right on the apples of my cheeks I
love how this applies blush because I am
someone who hates a heavy application of
blush for example like I'm wearing blush
right now but you can't even tell that
much that I'm wearing blush something
that will go for a more intense blush
but my times out of ten I like something
really natural I don't think that look
of really flushed cheeks personally
looks good on me I like a subtle kind of
look and this brush does that for me it
doesn't pick up a lot of blush at all it
applied a very light layer of product
it's my own brushes that I do have to
dip back into my blush over and over and
over again to get my desired
pigmentation but I love that about it
because I just I hate a blush brush that
just stamps like a round blush color on
my cheek so this is awesome I know Mac
has something similar I used to have it
but I gave it away it was kind of
scratchy and I think more if you have
one too but I don't I hope you can't
owned that one anymore I love this
because it's synthetic do you guys know
of any dupes for this brush if you do
let me know I want it to be synthetic
and I wanted to be just as soft and I
wanted to be decide if you have any
recommendation definitely let me know
because I love this brush so much okay
so after blush comes highlighting and
honestly I don't think there's a
highlighter brush I love more than this
this is the waver
1:34 looks powder fusion brush I have
spoken about so many brushes on my
channel when it comes to highlighting
there's a few that I've mentioned in
favorite videos and there's like there's
a ton of brushes I do I like to
highlight with but this is my favorite
there is something so different about
this brush and I can't put my finger on
it because honestly when you look at it
it looks like any other tapered
highlighting brush but it's not first of
all this is the softest highlighting
brush in my collection
literally strong credibly soft and I
love the Shea
of this I love how its tapered but it's
not too pointy it's just like the
perfect little egg and it is the perfect
size to get a really precise highlight
and I just love how this picks up
products so well sometimes I'm using a
different brush and I'll be highlighting
with something that I've never
highlighted with before and I'm like I'm
not really feeling it but if I go in and
use this brush with that same highlight
I swear it applies highlighter way
better than any other brush and there's
a ton of brushes that I feel aren't
highlighter friendly this one is amazing
but I do want to give an honorable
mention to this guy right here I don't
like fan brushes that much I rarely ever
use them but sometimes I want a super
glowy cheek sometimes I want my
highlight to come like all the way down
I kind of did it today where the
highlight does come a little bit further
down when I'm looking at the camera you
could see the highlight like right here
sometimes I don't do that sometimes I
just focus to highlight right at the top
of my cheekbones if I have a highlight
that's a little bit glittery or
something that's not very forgiving
sometimes I'll just do it right here I
like the highlight to go a little bit
further down and then I'll grab
something like this because it just
applies it to like your entire cheek
just a little swipe like this and it
like goes everywhere and not in a bad
way it just makes your whole cheek
really nice and glowy so I really love
that about this brush this is the morphe
m31 0 brush it is awesome
and I just wanted to give it a little
honourable mention because it is very
good and then the last version I wanted
to talk about is actually a lip brush I
thought I would mention it because I use
this all the time off camera this is the
Make Up For Ever 302 brush and I mean
there really isn't much to say about a
lip brush but I love the shape of this
one I love how precise it is it's just a
perfect little tool to really perfect
your lipstick and it's also awesome to
go in with like concealer and clean up
the lip line into a great little lip
brush I am looking for the perfect lip
brush at the drugstore leave me a
comment down below also with that
recommendation if you have one I want
one that's really precise and sticks I
like them to be stiff so if you have a
recognition let me know ok guys so that
completes this video
those are my holy girl currents amazing
favorite face brushes I would love to
know in the comments below what your
favorite Holy Grail makeup brushes are

brush that you actually think is worth
it because I got to be honest you into a
whole place of makeup and have it look
flawless with a bunch of drugstore
brushes you don't need high-end brushes
you really do not sometimes you'll
discover one that you're like oh you're
worse you really are and to me these
really are worth it so yeah let me know
