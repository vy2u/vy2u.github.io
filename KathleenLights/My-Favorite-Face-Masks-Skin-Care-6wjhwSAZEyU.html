skincare related video I'm gonna talk
about all my favorite face masks I
promised this video when I did my
skincare routine and of course I'm an
arse and now is when I get around to
doing it
you know me for some reason I love doing
skincare related videos without any
makeup on so why break the tradition
it's pretty early in the morning and I
feel like I'm getting six on my like
eyes are red if you've noticed if you
notice anyway I have six masks six I
have six masks to share with you guys
and these are my holy grail masks I do
use others every once in a while but
these are the ones that I love the most
and I would continue to repurchase I
will say though that I do use I do do a
lot of DIY masks like with manuka honey
I have manuka honey in my kitchen and I
use that as a face mask all the time
this isn't going to be DIY face masks
I'm not going to be sharing with you
like masks that I make on my own using
like food or things in my kitchen
these are masks you can find at the
store so I'm just going to go ahead and
get started I use masks for two
different reasons when my face feels
like you know it has had enough I've put
on way too much makeup this week my
pores are clogged it's not doing too
good I'm kind of breaking out I will use
a detox mask or a mask that's really
going to extract everything out of my
pores and just clean deep clean my skin
just take everything out and then I also
use masks when my face is just so
dehydrated so dry my skin is flaking you
guys not have dries good my skin is
flaking off it's just doing really
really bad it is in need of some
moisture then I will do hydrating masks
so I have two favorite hydrating masks
and three favorites detox masks so I'm
going to start with this guy right here
because it's technically not a detox
mask this is the glam glow youths mud
tingle exfoliate treatment this is the
little guy because it only cost me $20
if I were to get the full size it would
be like 70 bucks which is crazy for a
face mask so I always get the little
ones this is the black one and this is
everyone's least favorite mask but this
one is my favorite out of all the glam
glow masks because I
find that it is a mud mask so you put on
your face and it does kind of extract
the crap out of your pores and it pulls
things out but as you're washing it off
of your face it turns into an exfoliator
which I have really dry skin so I love
to exfoliate my face unfortunately I
have to buy a new one because mine
completely dried out because I had lost
this I lose everything and when I moved
to this house I had lost it and I
recently found it so it dried out which
is really sad I love how this one smells
and it has a bunch of little like stems
and like trees in here which threw me
off in the beginning but it just makes
my skin feel like no other mask of ever
used my skin feels like a baby's ours
when I'm done using it because not only
does it extract everything out of my
face but then it exfoliates as well so
my face feels amazing when I'm done with
this I know everyone loves the white
glam glow face mask and Danny actually
loves it he bought the full size and we
have it in our bathroom but I honestly
prefer this you have seen me mention
this in the past this is the Aztec
secret Indian healing clay world's most
powerful facial deep pore cleansing mask
100% natural calcium bentonite clay this
is the most intense mask in the history
of the world and I think it cost me
around $11 as opposed to 70 this will
take off everything you feel your face
pulsating and it actually says hit right
here fill your face pulsate you feel it
like throbbing while this is on your
face and I have sensitive skin it
doesn't break me out but my face is
really red when I take it off because it
literally pulls out your deepest darkest
secrets like it takes off it takes out
everything your pores will no longer be
clogged with this guy right here I got
mine at I herb comp I will find it and
link it down below this you have so much
product and this all you have to do is
mix it with water it does say that you
should mix it with apple cider vinegar
to get a smoother application and apple
cider vinegar is beneficial to your skin
so you could use it both with apple
cider vinegar or with water and they
both work pretty good the best like
detox face mask ever ever so when I want
to feel like I am at the spa
will usually dip my toes into this mask
right here it's a newer mask to me this
is from lush and this is the mask of
Magnum minty it's a face and body mask
this is the self preserving one which
means that it lasts a little bit longer
than the normal one these lush masks
what I don't like about them is that
they expire really really fast because
they are using like really natural
products so they expire really fast but
then the good thing is that they are
using natural ingredients so it's great
for sensitive skin it's better for you
this one is really nice it's very very
minty feeling and my face feels nice and
soft when I take it off it doesn't do
the effects that this does or even my
little black one but I find that it does
help with the texture of my skin and it
does um make my skin feel really really
soft so I do really like this one a lot
and then the last detoxifying mask I
have is this one and this one is amazing
for those of you who have really dry
skin because I find it doesn't really
dry out my skin this is from origins and
this is their clear improvement active
charcoal mask to clear pores this one
really helps clear out my pores it's not
as intensive this one I feel like I keep
referring to this it's not as intense as
this one but this one doesn't dry out my
skin this one does I love it but it
dries out my skin this one doesn't and
yet my face still feels really clean it
doesn't feel as dry and I feel like it
really does it's like a magnet and all
my gunk enos in my pores comes out I
love this one okay so now for my two
favorite hydrating masks the first one
is definitely the glam glow thirsty mud
hydrating treatment I love this mask it
smells like a Caribbean escape it's
amazing I'm almost done with this one oh
my gosh it smell so good I love using
this one overnight it says that you can
you leave it on for like 15 minutes and
then take it off but I find that it does
absolutely nothing if I do it like that
when I wake up my face just looks
smoother and a little bit healthier and
a little bit more hydrated so I really
love this one I get the $20 one because
not paying 70 bucks for it so I really
love it but my favorite favorite
favorite hydrating mask in the whole
world is this one this is the origins
drink up intensive overnight masks they
do have a drink up intensive like
15-minute one but I find that that one
doesn't work as good as this one this is
an overnight mask and this one smells
like apricot like peaches Oh smells like
like peaches
this one doesn't melt a little better
but I love the way that this one smells
- it's very fruity this one is different
like when I wake up in the morning my
face looks very plump look then when I
use this one this one's still hydrates
my face but this one hydrates my face my
face looks very plump and healthy like
if it isn't dry at all it's a miracle in
a little tube this one is my favorite I
highly highly recommend it ok guys so I
feel like this video was a little bit
quicker but these are my favorite face
masks that I work into my skincare
routine of course I don't use these
masks every day I use kind of like a mud
mask once a week and I use a hydrating
one once a week so I'm doing a face mask
about twice a week and I do see a
difference in my skin when I use face
masks regularly so I hope you found this
video helpful um leave me a comment down
below what your favorite face mask is
I'm actually I want to dive into more
hydrating face masks because I don't I
don't come across those very often so
leave a comment down below of your
favorite hydrating face mask and not
like a DIY one cuz I do a lot of DIY
hydrating face masks like with honey and
stuff I mean like when I could buy at
