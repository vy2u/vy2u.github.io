window and how weird this looks back
here not weird but this is not usually
oh you know what I mean anyway so
today's video is going to be my all-time
favorite high-end makeup products I
recently did a video dedicated to my
favorite drugstore makeup so this video
is dedicated to my favorite high-end
makeup so I actually wouldn't consider
this like the best high-end makeup this
is my favorite hi mekka I said hi and
makeup like 20 times this video is
actually a collab with a really good
friend of mine her name is Sarah and I
wanted to do this collab with her
because she doesn't have many
subscribers and I don't know why she's
so so good so I really wanted to help
her out and maybe get her name out there
and see if I could help her in some way
she does like wickedly cool tutorials
she's very talented it's she's kind of
like an artist
it's like she's very talented does her
makeup really well they're all different
and unique and so fun and she's just
like the sweetest person ever like
literally a little angel from heaven
she's so nice and we text all the time
she actually made me a journal from
scratch like made the paint not made the
pages that's a tree's job but she like
binded the paper and I don't know and
it's the nicest journal I have actually
keep it in my kitchen just in case I
need to write things down throughout the
day it's beautiful she's a beautiful
person inside and out so please um help
her out if any of you guys have a
youtube channels as well you know how
hard it is to get your name out there so
please check her link down below she's
gonna be talking about her favorite
high-end makeup as well we're gonna be
talking about makeup products we think
are worth the splurge so definitely
check her video out because sometimes
it's nice to know what makeup is worth
it out there so I will link her channel
down below go subscribe tell her I sent
you
and yeah once you're done watching this
video go check out her favorite high-end
makeup so if I would have recorded this
video six months ago I would have said
that this is the best palette I have
ever used in my life it's definitely one
of my favorites but I think I have found
thing just as good if not better then
this is Holy Grail for me for sure but I
have been obsessed with my Too Faced
chocolate bar palette this stuff is as
good as it gets and the reason I am
choosing this one over this one is
because it has more mattes it has more
eyeshadows it's a couple dollars cheaper
and it's great it is so great you have
different tones of brown all throughout
this you have a purple of green and I
love that the two highlight shades are
huge so it's a lot harder to hit pan on
them and highlight shades are shades we
use all the time
it's Holy Grail probably I'm gonna say
it it's better than my original Naked
palette that's so hard for me to say but
I love it just a little bit more than my
original Naked palette it's what I have
on my eyes I grabbed this over any
palette I own so I don't really own a
lot of high-end lipsticks just because I
kind of stick to what I know
I love MAC lipsticks they smell really
good they're just amazing and they're
cheaper than a lot of high-end lipsticks
but this is the best lipstick I have
ever used in my life these are the NARS
audacious lipsticks they took 32 they're
$32 which uh yeah that's expensive but
they're worth every single penny they're
more expensive than Mac but they're
better than Mac they have the best
formula in the entire world
they last forever on the lips and
they're not supposed to be like a
long-lasting lipstick they're really
really creamy they don't settle into my
lines everything about the formula is
spot-on there is not one negative thing
I have to say about this this one is in
the shade Raquel and it's the one I'm
wearing on my lips this is my favorite
lipstick of all time out of all the
lipsticks I own and I own a lot Raquel
is my favorite if all my lipsticks died
and I only had to have one forever it
would be Raquel Mac Pro Longwear
concealer is my favorite concealer ever
I love my Maybelline fit me and I love
the LA girls Pro conceal those are
drugstore concealers that I really enjoy
but this it doesn't get better than this
very very liquidy so it doesn't dry out
my under eyes but it has full coverage
so if you have really dark under-eye
circles this is going to be your best
friend
doesn't settle into my lines I put
powder on top and it stays put the
entire day I have tried a lot no I have
tried a few high-end foundations I'm a
drugstore foundation girl I think that
you can find really good ones at the
drugstore but the best high-end
foundation I have ever used is the Make
Up For Ever HD foundation my favorite
drugstore foundation of all time is the
Revlon Colorstay and I even think that
this is better so I've got to say that
this is my favorite foundation of all
time when I need to take pictures when I
need to go out like special occasions or
when I want my makeup to last all day I
go for this it doesn't have SPF so
there's no saline want to go outside it
doesn't have SPF in it which is perfect
for pictures because you don't get that
white cast and it has the perfect finish
it's not matte but it's not dewy
it's the perfect satin finish the way
you want your skin to look at all times
I highly recommend it it is pricey
it's like $42 I really want to try the
giorgio mono giorgio mono the Georgie
Armani Armani soap cream foundation or
something but I would never pay that
much for foundation ever in the history
of my life this is like as expensive as
it gets and this is perfect so I don't
need to really it's my perfect
foundation okay so the Anastasia brow
Wiz is the best in the entire world this
is the best eyebrow product I've ever
used I tried the pomade but it was too
fake looking for me
I like um as you can tell I like bushy
looking eyebrows like feminine like
Romeo and Juliet style eyebrows I don't
like that hole carved out
makeup artist eyebrows a lot of makeup
artists do their eyebrows like that I
don't like it I like more like shop kind
of eyebrows Lily Collins kind of
eyebrows so the pomade is too intense
for me
the brow is is perfect I use this and
then I use a powder on top hand down
Anastasia makes the breasts
the breasts Wow makes the best eyebrow
products and the brow is is good so I
recently discovered that Tarte Amazonian
clay blushes are probably the best
blushes on the market in terms of where
this is tarts exposed this is my
favorite are blush this is the only
Turkish I have know I have another one
and then I have a Tarte blush palette
this is the best one it looks very
plummy so you would think it would only
be good for the winter but it does give
a nice touch of color in the summer too
it's perfect
they last hours I will wear this blush
I'll put it on in the morning and it
will last all freaking day this is one
of the few blushes that I'm like damn at
the end of the night it's still on
perfectly no matter what foundation I
put on under which is saying a lot
they're pricey but they are worth it
especially if you're someone who you
wish your blush just stayed on forever
get Tarte Amazonian clay blushes any of
them
I recommend any of them but if we are
talking about a blush color this is my
favorite blush in the entire world this
is my favorite blush color this is the
best this is NARS blush in Madley these
blushes are really expensive but I have
come to the conclusion this is a recent
purchase for me I have come to the
conclusion this is the blessed this is
the best Bush I have ever bought it's
beautiful it's the blush I have on right
now it goes with every look so if you're
thinking who would want to buy a NARS
blush is expensive this will go with
everything it'll go with a deep smoky
eye with just mascara it's perfect
swatched on its own it doesn't look like
it's all that cool but on your cheeks it
gives the most beautiful blush look I
highly recommend it over any blush in
the entire world okay so I have to give
a shout out to this guy because I have
repurchased more of this mascara than I
have of any other mascara
I've been wearing this mascara since I
was 15 years old it's the first mascara
I've ever used and it's the best mascara
I've ever use this is the Clinique lash
doubling mascara I don't hear a lot of
people talking about this and I don't
know why it's honestly the best it's one
of those natural bristle things I do
like my Too Faced better than sex
mascara more for volumizing but this
gives me everything this gives me the
perfect amount of volume the perfect
amount of length and it doesn't clump I
do three coats of this and I'm like it's
like Volvo boom lashes with not one
clump in the world this doesn't believe
in clumps at all you don't get that
spidery lash look you get the most
natural but full wispy lashes with this
and I think this is like a $15 mascara
so it's not too bad it's expensive
compared to like Maybelline but when
you're thinking of like Benefit and
those mascaras this is cheaper than that
it's my favorite I will repurchase this
over and over again I have been buying
this mascara since I was 15 so do the
math of how many I've gone through so I
don't use this as often as I should in
my videos but it's my favorite highlight
of all time this is the bombs mary-lou
manizer I think that this highlight is
even better than the Becca highlighters
that everybody loves I like an intense
highlight and this gives it to me this
is very very intense it's that white
champagne gold color it's really really
pretty
can you tell it's again you can tell
there it's so intense and it gives the
most beautiful beautiful color to your
cheeks the bomb is on HauteLook a lot so
tried it so check hautelook if you want
to buy the bomb products but it's
honestly amazing but not just the
mary-lou manizer the Luminizer 's in
general are my favorites i wanted to
mention this one because this is my one
of my favorite makeup products ever like
out of all my makeup products the cindy
lou manizer is like top 5 I love it so
much I use it as a blush because I am
pretty fair but it's such a beautiful
shiny iridescent kind of blush you could
put a matte blush and then put this on
top and it
like illuminates your face so much I use
it in the spring and summer like crazy
the betty loumanizer is very bronzy it's
very dark this is a bronzer for me but
it's very it has like an intense Sheen
this would be perfect for deeper skin
tones I like to just dust it on top of
my bronzer in the summer to give me more
of a Jennifer Lopez look so yeah these
are amazing I highly recommend them the
best primer I've ever used
drugstore high end is the Mac Paint Pots
this is painterly I know a lot of people
like soft ochre as well I prefer
painterly this is the only primer that's
cream form that doesn't dry out my
eyelids I use one from Milani that comes
in like a tubby stick that I really love
but it's very drying this is not drying
on my eyelids whatsoever and I have very
very dry eyelids and I love it it covers
up all my veins my eyelids are covered
in veins it covers up all my veins and
it makes my eyeshadow last all day this
is the best eyeshadow base flash primer
in the history of the world I wanted to
give a quick mention to this because
it's my favorite it it doesn't exist
anymore but I have a ton of bronzers I
have a ton of bronzers in that drawer
and this is my favorite bronzer
hands down the best bronzer I have ever
used in my life this is the Sephora so
the vio bronzer it came out in the
summer I believe I did a whole video on
it I loved it so much it's the best it's
the best I have the perfect undertone a
lot of people have asked me does it
compare to hoola I personally don't
think so I have hoola on my face right
now but this is better the undertone is
perfect it looks like it would be too
light but it's amazing for contouring
the best bra it smells really good it
smells really good it's huge so I mean
it's not travel friendly but it's got an
amazing mirror it's my favorite bronzer
of all time I wear this every day that
I'm not filming
I feel bad putting it on when I'm
filming because you can't get it anymore
but I wear it constantly this is the
bronzer that touches my face the most
out of all my bronzers so I just thought
I'd mention it if you see this by any
miracle do not pay crazy amounts for it
on Amazon but I wish Sephora would bring
this back let's let's make a petition
let's sign a petition to bring that back
and then my last product is something
that I really want to mention because
it's the best liquid illuminizer I have
ever come across this is the Josie Maran
Argan illuminizer and I have used so
many liquid illuminating products becca
gerard cosmetics i've used a lot and
this one is the best the best of the
best it's very very intense I like to
mix this in with my foundation I like to
just dab it on tops of my cheekbones I
like to put it on before I put on my
foundation it's multifunctional and it
gives such a beautiful romantic Jennifer
Lopez kind of look which are my
favorites I highly recommend it it's
expensive but this will last you till
you die so okay guys those were my top
favorite high-end makeup products
there's a bunch of other products that I
really love but those are the ones that
if it ran out I would run out and buy it
immediately
except this cuz I can't get it anymore I
