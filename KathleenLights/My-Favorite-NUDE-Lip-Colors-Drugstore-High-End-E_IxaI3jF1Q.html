my favorite nude lip products I have lip
glosses lipsticks and a few liquid
lipsticks to share with you guys this is
another video in that series I started
where I show you guys my favorite lip
products in a certain color category
I've done my favorite red orange
lipsticks and I've done at my favorite
true red lipsticks as well or like lip
products I will link those two videos
down below but it's been so requested to
do my favorite nudes I've got a bunch of
comments in that red lip video telling
me to do nudes so I'm doing nudes for
you guys today I'm even in my nudists
shirt I almost look make it kind of a
little bit but this video is actually
gonna be different than my last two it's
gonna be a little bit longer I'm
actually walking you guys through the
colors usually I just put a little music
and I just do the lip swatches but
because nudes
they're just nudes are special I am
gonna breeze through them because I
don't want this video to be too long but
I'm still gonna show you lip swatches
I'm just gonna talk about them a little
bit and I'm gonna go in categories so
I'm gonna show you my favorite nude
glosses then liquid lipsticks and then
lipsticks so you might as well just get
started you're gonna do glosses first
and I have six to share with you guys I
will say when it comes to glosses I
don't really wear darker nudes I
typically like them to be a little bit
on the lighter side I do have a couple
that are a bit like deeper but most of
these are like very very nude oh that
does another thing I wanted to mention
obviously these are nudes to me there
are so many colors that fall under the
nude category depending on your skin
tone like something that's a deep tan
Brown on me might be a nude on someone
else but I'm just sharing with you guys
my favorite nude lip products these
aren't the best nude lip products these
are just the colors I like wearing so
please just keep that in mind
none of these colors go very very deep
on me but yeah I'm just gonna go ahead
and get started so my favorite lip gloss
of all time is pretty much buxom zuv
White Russian this is one of those
plumping glosses that feel really tingly
and minty on the lips which is what I
really like about it even though I don't
like mint
I love minty tingly lip glosses but it
doesn't hurt or sting I don't find it to
be too plumping I just think it makes
your lips look very very juicy it
doesn't have too much color payoff but I
like the like
milky pinky color that it gives me I
love this gloss and it lasts a really
long time on the lips a gloss that's
very very similar and I think it's the
reason I fell in love with it this is
the color pop gloss in fairy floss it's
my second favorite color pop gloss it's
a very similar color it has that milky
vibe to it I do think it has a little
bit more color payoff than White Russian
it's not as sticky or tacky as White
Russian but they're very very similar
this one is just a hair deeper like a
hair why Russian is a little bit peachy
err but I love it it's a great formula
and then same goes for a moon child I
think this is my most used lip gloss
ever even born the White Russian I
cannot get enough of this obviously I've
gone through like three tubes already
it's such a pretty everyday nude this
color looks great on top of any nude
lipstick and the subtle sparkle in this
just makes your lips shine and it is
just so gorgeous I love this color it's
amazing I used to wear the Marc Jacobs
lip gloss and sugar sugar all the time
and then after a moonchild that's pretty
much all I wear but I was wearing this
so much at one point this is a very very
opaque lip gloss you can wear this on
top of any lipstick but I think it looks
better just paired with like a lip liner
or on its own that's how opaque it is
you have to be careful with this because
if you apply too much you will get that
weird sticky but whole thing on the
inside of your lips that nude lip gloss
is content to give you but this is such
a great formula it lasts a long time on
the lips and it just makes your lips
look nice and juicy and it's a very nude
nude color and I loved this is a product
that I feel nobody likes nobody talks
about but I love the formula on these
this is the Too Faced
sweet peach creamy peach oil lip gloss
and this is in the shade peach fuzz
this is definitely an oil lip gloss but
I don't know it doesn't feel like oily
on the lips it just feels like there's a
barrier on your lips that's very very
moisturizing and thick I don't know how
to explain the formula but it is unlike
any other lip gloss I've ever used the
formula is super unique and I love how
this smells if you're a fan of the peach
scent you will love this I know a lot of
people are not a fan but I'm a huge fan
and I it's just it smells so good and I
just find this to be very nourishing and
hydrating I used to use this all the
time I used to throw it in my purse and
just apply it whenever my lips felt kind
of cracky and gross but I still wanted
to apply color you know I didn't want to
just use a lip balm it is so creamy and
peachy and delicious and then the last
glass I want to talk about is the Fanta
beauty gloss balm this is the only one
they have but it's called fenty glow
I am hoping and praying that she
releases more shades because this smells
like my entire childhood did you guys
see that coming
everything reminds me of my childhood I
know but this definitely does when I got
older I kind of started to like gloss a
little bit less but when I was in middle
school since like lip gloss was the only
thing I was allowed to wear the only
thing I really wore I had this little
fuzzy blue backpack it was a little Nike
backpack I used to carry around like 15
lip glosses in that purse at all times
and a lot of them were like the smokers
smokers smackers smackers smokers is
like jelly right I used to have like a
trillion of those in my backpack and
they smelled like this but besides the
scent the color is really nice it's kind
of like your lips but better lip gloss
it kind of has like a silvery sheen but
you don't really see it on the lips it
just makes your lips look nice and juicy
and plump and I love this color it's so
natural but in such a glossy beautiful
way it's awesome I looked everywhere for
my groovy lip gloss it's from
bareMinerals
I forget the name of it I think it's the
I don't know but it's a bare minerals
lip gloss
it's called groovy it has an amazing
formula and I love the color so much I
used to wear it non-stop and it vanished
like a lot of my stuff vanishes I think
I left it in a purse and then I might
have left it at someone's house because
that was traveling with me everywhere I
went and that is definitely one of my
favorite lip glosses like ever ever it
couldn't find it for this video so I'm
gonna have to freaking repurchase it cuz
I miss it anyway so out of all the lip
glosses I own those are my top dogs I
love them so much and now we can move on
to my favorite liquid lipsticks now this
one is a tricky category because when it
comes to liquid lipsticks I just
preferred deeper shades like if I'm
gonna use a liquid lipstick it's most
likely not gonna be a nude since liquid
lipsticks are so matte and a lot of them
are very drying it's hard to find a nude
that isn't gonna crack or crumble or
look disgusting on your lips now I made
it a point to not mention any of my
collabs well I mentioned moonchild
already
I have a bunch of aquarius's that are my
favorite news ever like I created
Aquarius because I wanted my perfect
nude so the liquid lipstick the satin
lip and the lippy stick obviously
they're my favorite nudes but I wasn't
gonna mention that in this video because
you've seen Aquarius like a trillion
times I'm sure but these are my other
favorites and these are all really great
formulas I don't find them to be drying
whatsoever there's only two in here that
are a little bit drying but I sacrifice
it because I love the color so much and
one of them is definitely this one it's
not drying it's just not as comfortable
as the other ones this is the dose of
colors liquid lipstick in the shade sand
it's my lightest liquid lipstick efforts
but lightest nude I have this is
literally sand it's pretty much a
concealer shade and I know that scares a
lot of people but this looks so cool
with a really really deep dark smoky eye
as long as you pair like a darker lip
liner underneath this can look really
nice too nude for some people but
sometimes I like that really nude nude
lip with like a little bit of gloss on
top ooh delicious I love it and the dose
of colored formula is actually really
good some people might say it's drying
but I find it to work for me it doesn't
really crack up on my lips and as long
as I put like a lip balm underneath it
works really well so I love sand
especially mixed in with other liquid
lipsticks like if I want to lighten up a
color I will add a little bit of sand
lightens it up beautiful so all for
cosmetics has some of the best liquid
lipsticks in the world because the
formula is just unbeatable they do dry
down to a matte finish so they look
matte on the lips but they're not drying
at all they just feel so incredibly
comfortable and my favorite nude that
they have is Manila it was hard to
narrow this down because bel-air and
South Paulo are also my favorite I would
say style Pablo more than bel-air but if
I had to choose I would say I like
Manila more this just goes with
everything even though it has more of
like a cooler undertone I pair this with
so many different eye looks I love this
guy I love all over liquid lipsticks so
if this color isn't for you definitely
check out either Sao Paulo or bel-air
because they're a little bit warmer and
I feel like you would love them if you
are looking for a nude in this formula
because it's that good like if I had to
pick the best
and of liquid lipsticks for nudes go to
Oprah they're so comfortable
another really amazing formula is the
girl lactic liquid lipsticks if you need
a nude also check your lactic they're so
comfortable on the lips as well my
favorite is bashful it just has that
nice warm undertone and it looks so
pretty and natural for every day this is
such a stunning color and it never
cracks down they smell really nice they
just look perfect throughout the entire
day
such a stunning formula okay so I don't
really dabble much into Kylie cosmetics
I have a few products that I've
purchased here and there but for the
most part I mean it's like it's like
it's okay but this this is my favorite
Kylie product and this is like one of my
favorite liquid lipsticks ever ever this
is the Kylie matte liquid lipstick in
the shade
I've used this so many times on my
channel there's something so unique
about this for some reason I can't seem
to find a dupe for this like an exact
dupe I cannot find it there's something
so warm and delicious about this liquid
lipstick I can't like transform my
makeup whenever I'm looking for a nude
but I want it to be deep but a little
bit warm and like Brown this is perfect
I freaking love the shade and it is
drying to some people but I find it to
be okay for me as long as you wear like
a lip balm underneath you should be fine
it's such a pretty nude I love this
color so much and then the last color I
want to talk about it's kind of like a
newer favorite the healthy lip from
Physicians Formula in the shade all
natural nude is such a pretty everyday
pinky nude it's not too pinky but it's
not too nude it's so pretty and the
formula is awesome at first when you
apply this you're like oh my gosh is
this gonna dry down but it does
eventually dry down it just takes a few
minutes because it is such a creamy
hydrating formula but once it does it's
very very comfortable it looks matte but
it's not drying it's such a great
formula and it's my favorite color they
have it's such a pretty nude okay so
those were my favorite nude liquid
lipsticks awesome formulas now let's
talk about my favorite nude lipsticks I
have 10 of them to share with you I have
actually like fifty to share with you
but I narrowed it down to ten well I
haven't exactly watched these next to
each other I know they're all different
but don't be surprised if some of these
news look alike okay they're different
they're different there are two of these
that are in liquid lipstick
type of packaging but I don't consider
them liquid lipsticks because they don't
dry down to like a matte finish so
anyway like a sorry so I have two of
these like chubby lip pencil style
lipsticks these are the bite Beauty high
pigment lip pencils I love all of these
these are so good they have a great
formula very creamy and just glide on
the lips but my favorite is definitely a
shade Madeira I feel like it has such a
pretty warm pink peachy undertone but
the finish is so nice on the lips cuz it
has a little bit of like a sheen to it
it's very creamy and just so buttery
smooth and its really really hydrating
as well I highly recommend these
especially in Madeira and then this one
is the nude Stix lip and cheek pencil
crayon in the shade whisper I like these
a little bit more than the bite ones I
think that this does last longer on my
lips than Madeira I don't know what it
is about it but this formula just seems
to be a little bit more long wearing but
again also another creamy formula it
doesn't still glide on the lips even
though it's not as shiny and as creamy
as the bite ones it doesn't look matte
or drying on the lips like you can tell
there's like some moisture to it you
know but this color is beautiful this
undertone is so nice whenever I'm doing
like cooler tone looks I'll pop this on
it is stunning and you could use this on
your cheeks but I never do because I
think that's strange but it says you can
so this has been a longtime favorite
since I started my channel and I'm not
gonna lie I used to use this a lot more
a couple years ago but I actually wore
it the other day to the movies that's
right I went to the movies and actually
got a couple compliments on this and it
reminded me how much I loved it and I
want to use it all the time now this is
the NYX soft matte lip cream in the
shade London out of all the soft matte
lip creams this one is my favorite well
out of all the nude ones it has like
this really pretty subtle tan brown
undertone and it kind of makes me feel
more tan like I just feel so summery and
like JLo II when I wear this nude I know
that sounds weird but that's just how I
feel and the formula is really nice as
well these do transfer these are not
liquid lipsticks but they do have a
matte finish they do slip and slide I
would recommend you wearing a lip liner
with these because if not they won't be
very long wearing but they just make the
lips look so smooth because the formula
is just so soft I love it highly
recommend these especially London
Charlotte Tilbury sent me all of her
Hollywood lips and this is my favorite
one I actually gave a lot of them away
to like friends and family but this one
I keep going back to over and over and
over again this is the shade Charlotte
darling which I don't know if she named
it after herself because it was her
favorite but it's definitely my favorite
I love this in the same way that I love
Kylie exposed like there's something
about this that's so unique and
different and it's and it's the reason I
keep going back to it it's just like
this peachy tan color that's so stunning
and it looks so pretty with so many
looks but I love the formula on this as
well it actually reminds me a lot of the
NYX soft matte lip cream but a lot more
expensive so I'm not exactly sure if
these are worth the money I just love
this color so much I think this one is
and I wear it all the time and then the
rest of these are in typical lipstick
bullets packaging except the last one
how many of you guys remember my love
for Barrett Oh wet and wild bear at all
I mean if you remember this then you
have been watching me since like five
subscribers but these megaliths
lipsticks have always been so good I
recommend them to everyone who's looking
for a super super super super affordable
lipstick that's gonna last a decent
amount of time and it's gonna have a
pretty good formula the packaging on
these it's a little chic but I mean what
do you expect is like two dollar
lipstick you can't have it all but I
love this color it's actually a dupe
from Mac velvet teddy I don't have that
one anymore so I can't swatch them
side-by-side to check but I'm pretty
sure if I remember correctly this is a
dupe for it and it's honestly the same
thing buy this one instead same thing
creamy formula just as good as Mac and
it lasts a really long time on the lips
I love this color it's awesome if you
want a nude that's not like concealer
nude but still nude but still kind of
bold and I love this lipstick okay so
the next one is the one I'm wearing on
my lips right now ever since I
discovered it I keep it in my purse I
actually wear it all the time
surprisingly this is the Too Faced
Sunday Funday lipstick and it came out
with their peach line oh my gosh is it
another peach thing wow I didn't realize
how much I'm like the two-faced peach
lip products but out of all the
lipsticks this one is definitely my
favorite I've got to be honest I don't
even wear any of the other lipsticks in
this peach line this color is just so
pretty it's the one I'm wearing on my
lips right now and there's something
about this like power
a formula but just apply is so easily
and it's just like this color I love it
so much I don't even have to use a
mirror it's just so creamy and smooth
but I love the formula cuz it just looks
nice and matte but not too matte it's
not drying at all I love it and it
smells like peaches I love this scent
and I smell the peach that off a day
which I personally like and it has like
this really pretty like topi undertone
okay so Milani has these matte lipsticks
that are really great the formulas are
amazing I love so many colors from this
range but I use this shade all the time
whenever I want to lighten the center of
my nude lipstick this is Milani matte
innocence it's a very very very light
nude I would only recommend this for
your entire lips if you are very very
very fair and you can't seem to find a
nude that's nude enough this is nude
enough it has that peachy undertone that
can be a little bit scary but for the
springtime it just looks so nice like
dotted in the center of the lips with a
little lip gloss on top I just love the
formula of these matte lipsticks so much
I really wanted to mention it and they
smell good too why can't I smell this
one
they usually smell like vanilla hmm who
remembers my love for Raquel I was
obsessed with the NARS audacious
lipsticks at one point I was collecting
them I do remember I was still living in
Mississippi these audacious lipsticks
are very pricy but in my opinion they're
so worth the money they're cheaper than
tomforde lipsticks and YSL lipsticks and
I think they're way better some of the
best luxury lipsticks out there but my
obsession was Raquel for a really long
time this is actually a brand new Raquel
I've only used this one like two or
three times because I went through an
entire Raquel isn't that crazy
this used to be my go-to nude lipstick
it was my favorite nude lipstick ever
it's a very opaque lipstick like
extremely extremely opaque just one
swipe of this will give you full intense
color payoff but it's still very very
creamy and buttery it's not drying it's
just a delicious pinky nude it has a
little bit of a peachy undertone a lot
of the times I'll wear this just dotted
on the lips because it is so pigmented
and it just looks so pretty
natural and I love this
I don't wear it nearly as much as I used
to and I don't know why because it's
amazing
so another amazing formula at the
drugstore when it comes to matte
lipsticks besides Milani and when a wild
these maybelline matte lipsticks are
awesome they have a you know what it
reminds me a lot of my Sunday Funday
lipstick the formula on this one is very
creamy but it has like that powdery
matte finish that's not drying at all I
don't want that to scare you and these
are very similar this one is in the
shade called daringly nude it's my
favorite maybelline nude it just pairs
so well with so many looks because it's
not too dark but it's not too light
either it's just a perfect pinky nude if
the formula is awesome it lasts all day
on the lips and it's extremely
comfortable and then the last lip
product I want to talk about is a newer
discovery to me but I've worn this like
four times already and I really like
this and I just want to mention it's
kind of like an honorable mention this
is the NYX powder puff lippy and this is
in the shade cool intentions I love that
name and I like this for a very strange
reason recently I've just been keeping
this in my purse and I'll just dab this
on my lips to give me that undone look
kind of like that imperfect lip look I
won't be very precise with this I'll
just apply to my entire lips but I'll
kind of like blend it in with my fingers
and make it look kind of faded and just
messy and for some reason I just really
like how that looks
it is a powdery finish so it does have a
matte finish but it's not drying it kind
of feels like nothing on the lips but I
really really like it and I really like
this color - it's a deep nude but it's
still like a nude I love it ok guys so
