getting a nail polish rack and I was
going through all my nail polishes and
color coordinating everything trying to
color coordinate everything because I
cannot call a coordinate nail polishes
in my life and then I decided that I
wanted to show you guys all the nail
polishes that I've been obsessed with
lately and not lately like I've loved
these nail polishes for years some are
new some of our old favorites and stuff
like that so I wanted to show you the
ones that I love to wear in the spring
and the summer I'm having a nail polish
on my nails right now because I want to
swatch it I want to see how well this
video goes I hope feeling this is going
to turn into a hot mess and I figured
looking at the nail polish isn't gonna
do much I mean I think you would want to
see swatches so wish me okay so I'm
going to show you the like pastelly
eastery colors first I don't know I
think of Easter when I see these colors
I would definitely wear these in the
summer as well but I just kind of wanted
to show you like the little baby pastel
colors first I don't know my favorite
baby pink of all time is definitely Opie
eyes Maude about you I've had this nail
polish on in a couple of my videos and
it was in my March favorites Fiji was my
life for a long time and for some reason
I like this one a little bit more
it is definitely similar but I do like
the formula of this nail polish better
this is not my middle finger guys so
this is a super sloppy quick swatch of
it this is two coats so if you're
familiar with feel like I'm flipping you
off but I'm not sorry I will pick a
different finger to do a swatch on next
time so if you are familiar with Fiji
you can see how similar they are but
like I said I like this one a little bit
more and I've been wearing it like crazy
I absolutely love it it is my favorite
baby pink of all time the next nail
polish I've had it for so long and it's
still going pretty strong I feel like
this was one of my first nail polishes
and that sounds really nasty but it's
still it's still still hanging in there
and it is Revlon the top speed like the
fast drying ones and
in the color cloud this is perfect
because it's not baby purple it's not
like a light lavender and it's not a
baby blue it is the perfect combination
of blue and purple it's beautiful and
decide explain to my nails so I'm not
like I don't know yeah so this is cloud
as you can see it is like a light blue
light purple it's really in between you
don't really know what I would say it's
more purple I guess some people might
say it's more blue I don't know I say
more purple I love this I wore this
almost every day last spring my friend
America is obsessed with this nail
polish as well it's one of our favorites
the next one I couldn't find anywhere so
I got it off eBay and it is getting a
little old with drinks and Sabbats
essays Vande ago and this is perfect
because it's peach and pink and it's
like I've never had a nail polish that
looks anything like this every time I
wear this nail polish I get complimented
this looks amazing on your toes by the
way this is my favorite toe nail polish
to wear every time I wear it someone's
like oh my god what are you what's on
your toes what's on your toes it's on
your nails
everyone everyone loves it I think it's
the perfect spring color like this is
the perfect spring color I don't know
how to describe this this what it looks
like swatched I'm sorry for the super
sloppy swatches I'm trying to get
through this video fast so I'm just like
you know so yeah this is what it looks
like and I love it I got it off eBay if
you're wondering um where you can find
it you might be able to find it still in
store but I've never seen it at
Walgreens or anything um it was like
four dollars on eBay so if you're
interested you could just check there
the next one is called mint sorbet and
it's from the sadly hansen extreme where
nail polishes and I love this because
this is the only mint nail polishes that
I have that I feel like it's a true mint
color you know some of them are too blue
or some of them are too green like they
don't look like the perfect minty nail
polish this one definitely is the
perfect mint
so yeah this is what it looks like
swatch all of the swatches I'm showing
you are two coats
if you're wondering um none of the nail
polish I've shown you so if I have any
shimmer or glitter or anything they're
just very pastel and creamy if you know
what I mean so the next one is my last
one out of the you know like the pastel
colors and it is called unicorn and it's
a simple colors nail polish and I wasn't
a fan of these simple colors nail
polishes until I got a really good base
coat and topcoat and they don't chip
anymore and they're a dollar ninety-nine
I think pretty sure they're two dollars
and they come in all sorts of colors and
I think that they're really good so as
you can see um this doesn't look that
great when I swatch it just crazy on my
fingers because they are but this nail
polishes is a bit sheer and you do have
to build it up I would say to go ahead
with three coats do three coats with
this nail polish but it isn't thick it
is this mastic formula it's not like
overly creamy so you can get away with
your nail pot with three coats and it
won't look thicker like globby at all so
that's why I do like it this looks awful
I'm taking it off already by the way you
can find simple colors at Walgreens
which I'm sure you already know but if
you didn't you find them at work okay
the next one is one of my favorite Essie
colors and it is called play date I love
this so much because honestly what you
can get away with just one coat it's so
opaque it's so true to color it's so
pretty oh my god I decide this is just
one hand one finger because it's getting
dark outside and I'm like wasting time
I'm showing you on two fingers and it's
kind of pointless but anyway this nail
polish goes on smoother than any of the
nail polishes I own and I own up quite a
few I don't want a lot but I do all the
nail polishes I own this one goes on the
creamiest and this Moses but um yeah
this is what it looks like and I love
this nail pump the next one is fairly
new I got it at Ulta the other day was
in my Ulta haul and it is the Sally hand
then extreme wear nail polishes and it's
in coral reef just just look at this
color
I can't this looks so nice on your nails
and this is what it looks like on my
finger it reminds me of bubblegum
oh my god it's quickly become one of my
favorite nail polishes of all time it's
so bright and fun it doesn't have any
shimmers or anything just looks very
creamy and bubblegummy I guess the next
nail polishes and other simple colors
and look at how bright it is can't can
you just look at this it is called pink
original but yeah whatever
this is definitely a fun nail polish it
is neon I don't know if you can tell her
how well it comes off on camera but it's
neon this looks so good in the summer
with a tan you have no idea um I got
pretty dark last summer and I wear this
on my toes all the time and looked so
good it looks really nice with a tan
it's just so neon and fun I love this
pink the next color is another pink but
it's more red pink like a burnt coral
red um if it makes sense how I explain
that but it is Opie eyes my chihuahua
bites and it's very similar to my other
favorite and it's called heatwave by Wet
n Wild these are really cheap and they
last a long time on your nails if you're
looking for a really cheap nail polish
that's good I suggest the wet and wild
megalast s same eye glass because I have
a couple wedding wilds the end they're
not section but these are very similar
and I love them because they almost look
like red neon if you know what I mean
I'll swatch them now so this this is
what they look like swatch this is the
one on this finger is OPI is my two
llama bites and this one is heatwave
this one has more orange to it and this
one has more pink to it but you can see
that they're very
similar what's amazing about these
wet-and-wild megalast um nail polishes
is the brush I'm obsessed with the brush
is so fat you can paint your nails with
one swoop so I love that this next nail
polish is another one of my my last one
wild favorites of mine and it is I need
a refreshment and it's spelled refresh -
mints like minty mint and this is what I
was talking about in the sense of I feel
like some nail polishes that say that
they're minty looking and they're not
said I mean this is definitely blue but
I really do love this color because it
is it's identical to the Tiffany blue
color for a long time I was trying to
look for that perfect Tiffany blue color
the one that matches those cute little
boxes perfectly and this is definitely
it this is a beautiful nail polish I
think you should really check it out
it's extremely cheap and they're really
really good they last a long time the
next nail polish is probably my most
worn nail polish it's probably my
favorite nail polish of all time I know
that sounds mmm I have a lot of
favorites I say a lot of my nail
polishes are my favorites of all time
but this is definitely top three I think
top five at least top five and it is the
another extreme where from Sally Hansen
and it is in Pacific Blue this nail
polish is extremely popular I know a lot
of you have seen it before but I've
never seen a blue as blue as this I
don't know if that makes any sense so
this is what it looks like swatched on
my fingers I wore this color in my navy
blue smokey eye my last video the one I
just posted before this and it's it
reminds me of the ocean it's just the
perfect that perfect summer blue it's
definitely worth all the hype it gets I
think you should check this out they're
not expensive at all and they're at
Walgreens
okay so I have two more to share with
you guys and one of them is called royal
and it's from that Revlon top speed one
that I showed you earlier and this is
what the nail polish looks swatched on
my fingernail honestly the lighting in
this room is not doing any justice this
nail polish because is very very bright
and like a cobalt blue um under the Sun
that's why I love this for the summer
and this nail polish looks so nice with
like a red accent nail and like red lips
it's very amazing I was sailor like that
whole scenery red white and blue kind of
color if you know what I mean so I
really really loved this and my last
favorite nail polish is called
nice sunglasses and it's from OPI and
it's this burnt yellow color and I like
it because it's not yellow like the
crayon it has a darker burnt kind of
look to it it almost has a mustardy feel
to it mmm I guess kind of looks like
mustard but I love wearing this in the
summer because it is so bright and fun
and that's what summer nail polishes are
all about how bad are my roots from a
scale of one to ten ten so yeah guys
that's it these are all my favourite
nail polishes you the ones that I love
wearing in the spring in the summer and
I thought I would share them with you
guys just in case you want to pick any
of these nail polishes up I recommend
them oh they're beautiful and perfect
