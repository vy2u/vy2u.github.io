to all of my favorite nude lipsticks and
lipglosses I wanted to share these with
you because they've gotten questions to
do the perfect nude lip tag I think
that's what it's called and I decided to
just film all of my favorite nude
lipsticks instead I think it would be a
little bit more helpful so I have both
drugstore and high-end products to share
with you guys today and yes this is a
nude lip video when I'm wearing a bright
red lip don't ask but I will have
swatches of me wearing the nude
lipsticks on my lips so don't you worry
so some of these will range in shades
they might seem a little bit similar on
my lips but some of them are like a
pinky nude a beige e nude a brownie nude
and you know all that stuff so I'm going
to go ahead and start off with the
lipsticks first and the first one I'm
going to share with you guys is this one
from Mac and it is called cute and I
wore this lipstick a ton like two years
ago
non-stop this lipstick is a glaze so
it's very very glossy it's a little bit
sheer it's not like super pigmented like
an amplified cream or anything like that
but it just makes your lips look nice
and glossy it's very light but I still
really really like it it looks nice
paired with different smokey eyes or
anything like that I really love this
lipstick and these swatches I show you
right now
look a little bit dark because my room
was very very dark when I was doing the
swatches and I have very pigmented lips
on top of that like my lips are pretty
brown naturally so hopefully these
swatches right here will be a little bit
better so yeah this is Hugh and I really
love this lipstick it's great the next
one is from the drugstore and it is from
Maybelline and it is called blushing
beige Maybelline came out with a bunch
of lipsticks they're called the Buffs
collection and they're different nude
shades depending on your skin tone you
will find a good nude in that collection
and this one's just my favorite one it's
called blushing beige like
and it's just a nice beige nude and I
really really love it you can see here
it's a little bit it looks similar but
they look similar
this is it right here it looks very
similar to hue but it is more beige like
it has a little bit more Brown to it
while he was a little bit more shiny and
pinkier so yeah I really really love
this nude lipstick um I'm not too crazy
about the way the Maybelline lipsticks
smell but I can look past that because
this nude is really gorgeous and it
looks amazing paired off with different
looks it's very very creamy goes on
super smooth and yeah I recommend it
this next one is also from Mac and it is
called myth most of my high-end
lipsticks here will be Mac because they
are my all-time favorite lipsticks ever
but this one is called myth and I used
to use this one a ton as well I use it
more in the winter time because it is a
little bit pale so when I have too much
of a tan I look a little bit but this
one is probably the lightest nude I own
it is a satin finish so it does look a
little bit matte on the lips but not
completely drying it doesn't dry out
your lips and this is it right here you
can barely see it because it's very
light and it's more of like a peachy
light shade it's not like a light pink
it's like a light peachy color I like to
pair it off with a darker gloss on top
personally because it might be a little
too nude by itself but I still love it
and I will repurchase it when I run out
of it because it's like a staple for me
this next one is from Wet n Wild and it
is called bear at all and it is a very
Brown nude Kylie Jenner has been wearing
like that really Brown 90s nude lip
recently and this one I think would work
perfect if you're trying to achieve that
because it is a very Brown nude it is a
matte finish
just like the Kylie one these aren't
drying on the lips at all I really
really love the Wet n Wild mega lash
line they are amazing and this will stay
on your lips forever if you are looking
for the perfect nude
will last all day I definitely recommend
bear at all even though it is a little
bit dark it still looks beautiful on so
many different skin tones like so many
different skin tones and it lasts
forever like I will swatch it on my hand
and it'll stain my hand huh it lasts a
long time it's good this next one is
from Mac as well and it is my favourite
Mac new lip of all time and it is called
creme de nude this nude lipstick is the
perfect one for me they cream Sheen so
it's going to be nice and creamy on the
lips very very smooth and it's just the
perfect color personally in my opinion I
love wearing this lipstick when I have
like a really intense smoky eye going on
just because I think it looks so so
beautiful it is very creamy and glossy
so it doesn't last a long long time I do
have to keep this in my purse and
reapply throughout the day but that
doesn't bother me this is the color
right here you can't really see it
because my skin color kind of blends
with it but it is a beautiful beige pink
very very similar to Maybelline's
blushing beige in my opinion now that
I'm looking at them swatched very very
similar but I do like the smell of this
more the formula and the texture of this
one a little bit more but if you're on a
budget definitely go for blushing beige
because they're pretty darn similar this
next one is probably one of my top 5
favorite nude lipsticks ever just
because the formula is so amazing and it
is from Milani so it is drugstore and it
is called nude cream this lipstick is so
beautiful it looks great on a lot of
different skin tones because it's not
too pale and it's not too dark even when
my lips look a little bit crappy I still
can apply this and it won't look gross
it won't sink into the lines the formula
is just unreal and for the price it's
like shocking I love these Milani
lipsticks and they smell like watermelon
Jolly Ranchers
smells so freakin good and this is the
color right here it's like a baby pink
but definitely still a nude and I just
love it so much this next one is from
Mac again but I promise it's the last
MAC lipstick I'm going to be talking
about today and it is in the shade peach
stock this is a permanent color this
isn't limited edition I used to think it
was because I got it in the liberty of
London collection yeah but it's a
permanent color and this is what it
looks like it's a beautiful lipstick it
is a satin finish and it is very very
peach it's like a peachy Brown nude it
is definitely one of those lipsticks
that look amazing on darker skin tones
but I wear it anyway just because I love
it so much this is it right here it is
the perfect nude before I think anyone
darker than me it just looks absolutely
beautiful on the lips if you're looking
for that perfect dark peach nude I
definitely recommend peach stock I love
it so much
the next lipstick I want to talk about
makes me really really sad because it's
discontinued so I almost don't want to
mention it but I use it all the time and
I wear a lot in my videos and it is
Revlon's soft nude why did they
discontinued this please someone explain
it to me because it is the perfect nude
lipstick like the perfect drugstore nude
yeah it's this one that's this one right
here this lipstick is very smooth and
creamy on the lips I think what I love
so much about it is the formula besides
the color it is beige but very peachy at
the same time as well it has like
combination of all the perfect nude
shades in one I don't know how to
explain that that doesn't make any sense
but I just love this lipstick so much
and if anybody can find out where I can
get my hands on this thing please let me
know because I love it I love so much
the next thing I want to talk about is
this little lipstick duo from bite
Beauty it comes with two lipsticks two
tiny little versions of lipsticks this
one is in the shade musk which is a very
dark like brownie nude definitely
is they kind of new to someone with
darker skin tone would really really
like even though I love dark brown nudes
I will wear them because I don't care
but this is the color right here it is
you know kind of like a mafia brown
that's still so beautiful and then the
other side comes with this one right
here and it is called lychee I'm not
sure if I'm pronouncing that right but
lychee and this to me is like the most
amazing lipstick in the history of the
world it's this one right here so it's
like a much lighter version of it and a
little bit more pink but I still love it
it looks amazing this color looks
amazing with anything you put on your
eyes like you can go very light on your
eyes and wear this lipstick and it'll
look amazing or go very dark on your
eyes and it will still look really good
and not a lot of nude lipsticks can do
that for you I cannot tell you how
amazing this little duo is you guys
don't understand you don't understand
the texture of these binary lipsticks
are so amazing that I like them more
than Mac and that's saying a lot they go
on smoother than any lipstick I've ever
put on my lips like without a doubt they
go on so so smooth even though the scent
is like a I can't describe this thing
even though I like the way that MAC
lipsticks smell more than this the
formula is just unbeatable seriously
guys if you haven't tried the bite
Beauty lipsticks try them because the
formula will knock you out it is so good
ok so now I'm going to move on to my
favorite nude lip glosses and I'm not a
lipgloss where I hate the feeling of
stickiness on my lips I just I hate it
but I really do like nude glosses to
make some nudes darker to make some new
slider you know I like it ok first one
I'm going to be talking about is my
favorite nude lip gloss in the history
of the world like I haven't come across
any nude gloss I like better than this
and it is the NYX butter gloss in creme
brulee you guys have seen me use this a
bunch of times this is the perfect nude
gloss I like it because it's pigmented
enough to wear on its own if I just want
a quick gloss you know just that bit dab
and we're out the door even though I do
for wearing it on top of a lipstick just
because my lips are so pigmented that a
lot of these brown shines through
but this gloss is on real it's like the
most creamiest beige color this is it
right here at the bottom it's a
beautiful beige pink it's so nice it
looks great on top of really pale nudes
just to umph it up a little bit I'm just
I love it very very inexpensive and it
looks great by itself or on top of many
many lipsticks so definitely check out
the NYX butter glosses oh they also
smell like Candyland they smell good the
next one is also a butter gloss and it
is in the shade fortune cookie it is a
very very pale nude it's also not as
pigmented as creme brulee but I actually
really really like this one
because I could put it on top of any
dark nude lipstick and just make it a
little bit lighter this is it all the
way at the bottom you can't really see
it because it is a pale nude but if
you're looking for that perfect light
light nude gloss then definitely go with
fortune cookie because it's it's cute I
really like it the next one I'm going to
talk about is a lip gloss from Almay and
I don't hear a lot of people talking
about these but this one is in the shade
rosy lipped I don't wear it in videos
often because this is my everyday lip
gloss this is the lip gloss I wear when
I just put on mascara and I want to go
to like Walmart or something and I'll
put on mascara and I'll just put this on
my lips and I've go out the door because
out of all the lip glosses I own this is
the one that's the least sticky almost
feels like a chapstick on your lips
honestly that's how not sticky these
suckers are I will say though that they
are not very pigmented anything lighter
than this shade does not to come out on
your lips at all the darker ones are
pigmented though you can put them on
your lips and you can tell that they're
there like the dark orange or the dark
purple and stuff like that but they
still don't pack a punch like a very
pigmented lip gloss so keep that in mind
when you go buy these but I like that
about them because when I don't want to
try too hard I just put these
and like I said do not buy anything
lighter than this because it will not
show up at all but I really like this
one it's like a very soft brown color
and to me it's like my lips but better
since I already have really dark
pigmented zips to begin with I'll just
slap this on when I don't want to try
too much and it looks really pretty this
is it
my swatching sucks this is it right here
I also am so amazed by the scent of
these they smell like warm vanilla
cookies and I just love warm sense like
that so yeah I really really love this
one for just like a picnic at the park I
love it the next one I'm going to be
talking about it's probably like my
favorite lip gloss formula in the
history of the world and it is the buxom
lip gloss in White Russian besides the
color because the color is amazing but
the formula of these buxom glosses are
so great they are plumping glosses but
honestly when I put them on I don't feel
my lips getting bigger and personally I
don't like plumping lip glosses because
they hurt like a mother but this does
not hurt whatsoever probably because it
doesn't really do a great job at
plumping my lips but it doesn't hurt I
love that about this also it does give a
nice tingling feeling when you put this
on your lips this gloss you can put it
on and you immediately feel like a
tingling cold sensation I don't know
it's really weird like if I put it on
and I stand in front of a fan my lips
get really really cold as weird as that
sounds but like I said this is in the
shade White Russian it is a very very
milky baby pink
I do wear it by itself all the time it
just gives you a nice sheer wash of like
that light pink color and of all the lip
glosses I own this one is the stickiest
but I don't mind it because it's not
something that I'm like it's not like a
Mac what are those called the mac
lipglass
or something I cannot with those lip
glosses it's not that sticky it's just a
little bit sticky but it lasts a really
really long time on me like
I can wear this lipgloss all day it just
lasts a long time I really love these
buxom glosses degree my last lipgloss is
from Milani and it is called Behr secret
this is a very Brown nude but I love
these Milani lip glosses because they
are super super pigmented okay this is
the color right here like I said it is a
brown nude but super super pigmented all
of the lip glosses in this line are
amazing they're very creamy very very
pigmented and I love them because you
can wear them by themselves or on top of
a lipstick of course but they have
enough color payoff to wear you can wear
them straight alone
they smell like straight-up Oreo
brownies you know I've said this before
but the Oreo brownies that come in like
a little packet they smell just like
that I cannot wait to show Danny this
lip gloss and fry and have him smell it
because he eats those aura brownies all
the time and I want to freak him out
because they smell identical so yeah the
scent I don't know if I love it or if it
creeps me out I'm in between both I love
it but it's weird I don't know okay guys
so that concludes this video the Sun has
