spring I just love this time of year
because I bust out all of my favorite
orange makeup like my favorite orange
lipsticks and blushes and eyeshadows you
guys know how much I love throwing warm
colors all over my face
especially orange if I can wear orange
lipstick everyday I would I really would
so because spring is already here and
summer is approaching I figured I would
do an entire video dedicated to all of
my favorite orange makeup just because I
see myself wearing these things a lot in
the next few months so I hope you guys
enjoy it hopefully and this isn't weird
I don't know I have three categories in
this video I have a shadows blushes and
lip products and keep in mind that these
are not all going to be just plain
orange so these might lean towards the
pinky side of orange or the peachy side
of orange or the red II side of orange
but they all have some sort of warm
orange them so I'm going to go ahead and
start off with the eyeshadows I have
three eyeshadows to share with you guys
so the first eyeshadow is the perfect
crease color your perfect little
transition shade and it is this eye
shadow right here and it is called Peach
Smoothie and this is from makeup geek
you can get our eye shadows on the
makeup geek website they are all really
amazing and this one is supposedly a
dupe for similar silk by Mac I wouldn't
know because I don't own that one but
this seriously is such a beautiful
peachy shade it's the perfect color to
put in your crease when you are going to
do like an orange eye I have it in my
crease right now which you can't really
tell but it just blends all your warm
shades beautifully if you are into those
warmer type of eye shadow looks then
definitely buy this because this would
be your best friend for your crease
seriously amazing and then the last two
eyeshadows are from Mac and I keep them
in my little Mac palette right here that
is just filled with really random colors
I'm sure you've seen this in a couple of
my videos but I really quickly want to
talk about amber lights again because I
really can't talk about that eye shadow
enough right yeah it is this eye shadow
right here and like I said before it is
called amber light I have talked about
this art shadow
probably too many times here on my
channel but it is my absolute favorite
eye shadow
of all time and it's just so beautiful
to me because it is a very burnt copper
but it has so much orange to it
no I just really really love it it
shines on your eyelid beautifully this
is the perfect eye shadow in this summer
it's so beautiful just to slap this all
over your lid when you have a nice
beautiful summery tan I just love this
eyeshadow so so much definitely pick it
up if you haven't already because it is
my favorite and then the other one is
this one right here which can be a
little intending because it just
straight up orange and it is called rule
which is also by Mac and it is a matte
finish and it is very very very orange
but that is of course what I love about
it I did do a get ready with me using
this eyeshadow and this is the only
eyeshadow I used on my entire lid it's a
pretty old video but I will link it down
below so you guys can check it out it is
honestly one of my favorite eye shows of
all time and this is beautiful if you
want to do a really really neutral eye
and then do like a pop of orange
somewhere this is perfect for that I'm
obsessed with this eyeshadow it's great
the next thing I want to talk about our
blushes and I have three to share with
you guys the first one I have mentioned
in a recent favorites video and it is
from the Sephora brand and it is called
tangerine tease and this is absolutely
gold just look at it just look at it
it's broken I love this blush because it
gives you such a beautiful glow there is
a sheen to it it's not matte it just
really makes you look like you're a
Orange little goddess I don't know I
love it it makes your face super super
glowy it doesn't have two shades here
this one is a little bit more of a burnt
orange and this one is a little bit more
peachy and this side is a little bit
more shimmery not a scary shimmery but a
beautiful glowy shimmery I just swirl my
brush in this and then apply it to my
cheeks so that I can get both colors and
it is beautiful I just absolutely love
it
the next one I'm going to talk about is
from the drugstore and it is by NYX and
it is their blush in cinnamon now this
stuff is intense like it's really
scary-looking like I'm sure a lot of
people pass this up on the drugstore
because they look at it and they're like
what I would never put this on my face
never but it is quite wearable if you
use a light hand this is the blush I am
wearing on my cheeks right now and I
absolutely love it it is a very very
bright bold color so like I said you
have to use a light
with this but once you do it does give
you such a beautiful look to your cheeks
this is a matte finish for those of you
who do not like shimmery blushes give
cinnamon a chance it is an affordable
brand and I think it would be perfect
for a spring and summer and then the
last Bush I want to talk about is from
Mac and it is called Spring Sheen
now this one isn't incredibly Orange but
if you pair it with like an orange
lipstick or orange eyeshadow it really
brings out the orange in this blush it
is very very similar to NARS orgasm but
I find this one is prettier this is a
shimmery blush but I find it to be quite
wearable you could really build this up
so it's like super intense and has that
like frosty gold look which can actually
be really pretty or you could just sheer
it out and just have that glow to your
cheeks that I actually prefer I don't
know I just really love this blush and I
find myself reaching for it throughout
all of spring and summer and then the
last thing I want to talk about are
orange lip products obviously have a lot
more to share with you guys than just
three things because lip products are my
favorite so I'm not going to go in any
particular order I'm just going to grab
them and show you the first one I want
to share with you guys it's from Wet n
Wild and it is called 24 karat gold and
it is a very very very very vibrant
orange lipstick it is a little bit more
on the burnt side of orange than on the
neon side of orange if that makes any
sense I don't know I just really love
this lipstick it's very very creamy it
glides on super smooth and it is very
affordable I definitely recommend this
one the next lipstick I'm gonna be
talking about is from Mac and it is
called more inch and this is probably my
favorite orange lipstick of all time
it's this one right here of course all
these lipsticks are going to kind of
look a little bit similar because
they're all pretty much orange but some
of them are different and personally on
my lips I could tell the difference
between this one and the one wild one I
just showed this one is a little bit
more orange that makes any sense they
look pretty much identical on my hand
but this one is creamier and glossy err
while the wet and wild one is a little
bit more matte the next one I want to
talk about is a dupe for more inch that
reason why I am including it because if
you want to get your hands on morons but
don't want to spend the money on it go
ahead and pick up sweet nectar by Milani
it is pretty much the exact same
lipstick same finish very very glossy
very moisturizing I love this lipstick
so so much and it smells like watermelon
Jolly Ranchers oh it's so good all of
the Milani lipsticks are great by the
way but this one is an extra great one
especially for this time of year the
next lipstick I want to talk about is
also from the drugstore and it is a
maybelline color whisper so it's not
really a lipstick it's kind of like a
lip balm and lipstick in one and it is
in the color coral ambition I use the
crap out of this last spring it is the
absolute perfect everyday shade it's
this one right here so it's a little bit
more pinky than the other lipsticks but
it does have that beautiful orange to it
and it is a color whisper so it's gonna
be sheer of course but it is so so
beautiful like I said it pretty much to
use this almost every single day in the
summer I just throw this in my purse and
would reapply and it's just oh I love
this color whispers so so much
the next lipstick is another MAC
lipstick and it is a matte formula and
it is called so shot this is your
perfect red orange and it is this one
right here as you can see it does have a
lot of red to it but if you swatch this
next to a true red lipstick you see how
much orange is in this I absolutely love
this this looks so good with like orange
blush and just mascara on your eyelashes
and that's it
it just really dresses up your face I
don't know it's one of my favorites it's
great the next one is my Revlon and it
is another matte lipstick and this one
is in the color smoked peach this is of
course a peachy kind of orange shade and
it is freaking gorgeous
I recommend this lipstick to people who
want to start wearing orange lipsticks
but don't want to just dive in and buy
something like more inch you want to
progress slowly and get the color little
by little I definitely recommend that
one because it is the most wearable
orangie peachy type of shade that I own
and it just looks so good on so many
different skin tones the next one isn't
really orange it is very much peach but
I just really
and it is the Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stain in charm somebody
people don't like this and I don't know
why because it is probably my favorite
kissable balm stain but it is such a
beautiful peachy shade I recommend this
more for people with fair skin because
if you do have like medium to dark skin
this will make you look dead it will
just wash you out way too much so if
you're very very fair I think you might
like this if you are into the peachy
kind of colors and then the last lip
product is a lip gloss I just felt like
I needed to add a lip gloss because they
are all lipsticks and it is the Revlon
lip gloss and coral reef this lip gloss
is so beautiful it looks amazing topped
over any coral lipstick or orange
lipstick it just gives your lips that
juicy orange look I absolutely love it
and it's not sticky I don't know if this
is available anymore because I keep
trying to look for it and I can't find
these anywhere I'm pretty sure they're
discontinued so because of that I
decided to give you guys a dupe and it
is also from the drugstore and is
Melanie's coral crush this is pretty
much the exact same lip gloss it is just
as pigmented just as creamy so if you
guys have been trying to look for this
gloss but cannot find it go ahead and
pick up milania's coral crush because
they're the same pretty much by the way
if you are wondering what's on my lips
right now I have a little bit of so shot
mixed with Revlon's smoked peach and it
gave me this really pretty peachy orange
e shade okay so that is the end of this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it I just
really wanted to share with you all of
my favorites
makeup products that have the warm
orange tones to them so I hope you
enjoyed it thank you so much for
