a lip swatch video I'm going to be
sharing with you all of my favorite
orange lip colors for summer
well orange / red orange because a lot
of these have a lot of red to them and I
asked you guys if you wanted to see this
video and a ton of you guys said yes I
would love to make this kind of like a
series showing you swatches of my
favorite lip products like in a certain
color so today we were doing orange /
red orange maybe I'll do one based on
nude colors one on mom you know all that
stuff but I thought it would be a good
idea to film this video because honestly
this is my favorite lip color to wear I
have a hundred orange of the colors but
I narrowed it down to 16 of my absolute
favorites I have like 15 more that would
be crazy
so yeah the way that I'm going to do
this is really simple I'm just going to
play the lip swatches and that will be
the video I'm I'll be writing some info
on the screen during the lip swatches in
terms of like price and finishes and all
of that please keep in mind that a lot
of these colors are going to look
identical a lot of these colors are
exactly the same almost some are just a
hair brighter a hair warmer I mean it
just depends but I thought it would be
good to do this video because you get a
huge variety in this video some of them
are liquid lipsticks some of them are
just regular lipsticks some of them have
a sheen some of them are really matte so
no matter what kind of formula you like
to wear on your lips you will definitely
find a ready orange lip color that works
for you I'm going to show you the
swatches on my arm just like to see the
colors side by side and compare them
like that yeah without further ado let's
get into this really simple quick fast
video and here are my favorite orange /
red orange lip colors
you
okay guys so that completes this video
those are my favorite orange lip colors
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I love this color leave me a
comment down below if you want me to
turn this into a series and if you do
what color would you like to see next
yeah I believe me thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
