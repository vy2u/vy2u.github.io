a video on my favorite face powders for
dry skin you guys know I probably say it
in every single video but you guys know
that I have very dry skin especially in
the winter it's like so for a really
really long time I didn't use powder at
all every powder I put on my face looked
really really really cakey when I first
started out with makeup I thought that
the only makeup brand growing up was Mac
so I had the studio fix powder which if
you know that powder that powder is like
it's a powder foundation I think is
thick and it was first of all I broke me
out really bad and it was just so thick
but it's the only thing I knew because
all my friends we're using that one I
don't know anyway for a long time I
couldn't find any powder that suited my
skin type but today I will be sharing
five with you then maybe I love some of
you that maybe a little bit to some of
you but the I'm not naked by the way
just that I throw that out there anyway
I'm just gonna give into the video these
are my favourite powders for my skin
type and unfortunately I only have one
drugstore powder to share with you
for some reason I haven't tried many
powders from the drugstore that suit my
skin type so leave a comment down below
if you have a favorite Holy Grail powder
for your face if you have really really
really dry skin and you find that a
powder at the drugstore works for you
let me know down below coz I will go get
it I want to talk about my favorite
powder foundations I have two that i
really really love one has a lot more
coverage than the other i think so i'm
going to start off with my favorite this
is the a cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination powder i have
mine in light this is like my normal
shade when i'm not tan this is great
they do have two different powders they
have the celebration foundation
illumination and they have the
celebration foundation powder which is
probably better for those of you with
oily skin this is so nice for dry skin
because it gives you really nice
coverage like i will apply a primer to
my entire face a hydrating primer
something you know to help
- and then I will go in with this
product and it doesn't make me look
cakey but it does give me nice coverage
I like to use this when I'm not filming
so I'll just like you know on a regular
basis if it's really really really hot
outside I'm like heck no I am NOT
putting on foundation in this heat I
hope going with something like this I
like to use this kind of brush this is a
morphe g-seven brush from there gunmetal
collection because it's dense enough to
pick a product but it's like actually
really flimsy at the same time so it
doesn't pack it on because if I pack on
too much powder on my dry skin it will
look cakey no matter what so I have to
work in light layers we'll do that
around my entire face and the places
where I need more coverage where I need
something more than just a dusting of
this I will go in with a flat top comb
oh I will go in with a flat top kabuki
really similar to like the Sigma flat a
flat top kabuki that gives me maximum
coverage with powders like this but
again I can only use them in certain
areas anyway so this is my favorite
favorite favorite powder foundation
because this powder has a slight sheen
to it it's not a flat matte I don't know
how to explain it all I can tell you is
go to Ulta and swatch it and when you
touch it it almost feels creamy like
when you blend your fingers into the
powder it almost has a creamy effect on
your fingers and on your skin I don't
know it's freaking magical I don't know
how to clean it it's magical and it's
great for us girls with or guys us
people with dry skin it's great so
another one that I really love is the
NARS all day luminous powder foundation
I have mine in the shade Fiji this is
what it looks like I love this for two
reasons I do like this as a powder
foundation not as much as I like the
ecause medics one but I like it on days
where I'm having a really good skin day
and I don't need to cover much because
this doesn't have much coverage this is
impact the kind of punch this one does I
also really like to set my makeup with
this because it gives me an extra layer
of coverage without looking cakey
because this is a very soft creamy
powder it just it gives you like a light
wash of coverage and it's really nice
on my dry skin I know a lot of people
don't like this for some reason on
Sephora like people hate this I've read
but I personally really like it for my
skin it doesn't emphasize my like
texture it doesn't emphasize dryness on
my face and it's just it's really nice
it comes with a little sponge on the
batter so like if you want to touch up
throughout the day you can so those are
my two favorites powder foundations now
I want to talk about setting powders
this is the Maybelline fit me and I have
mine in 1/35 creamy natural you guys
know I use this to set my under eye
concealer all the time it's my favorite
from the drugstore and even in real life
it's one of my in real life what does
that mean uneven in hot from high end
it's one of my favorite setting powders
like for under the eyes sometimes it's
really really hard to find a powder to
put underneath your eyes or it doesn't
emphasize your like lines or it doesn't
look like crepey and this one doesn't do
that there is a definite sheen to this
powder you rub your finger in it and
then you swatch it and there is a glow
to this powder it's pretty incredible I
don't know if you can see it here look
you probably can't but there is a
definite glow to it it has a little bit
of a sheen nothing too crazy but it just
looks great on dry skin because of that
luminosity and their regular powders are
really really nice too for dry skin not
just like the light ones like for every
skin color they have okay so let's talk
about my old faithful here this is my
old faithful this is a Mac mineralized
skinfinish natural I have mine in medium
this is the first powder I discovered
that I was like I can wear powder
it was like a moment I was like well a
powder that actually doesn't look
disgusting on my face this is the first
powder I discovered I even talked about
it like two years ago on my channel I
was like I finally found a powder I
could use this is a great great powder
because you could also use this as a
powder foundation because if you do a
couple of layers it does give you some
coverage so you can totally use this as
a powder foundation if you have just a
little bit to cover it's not like full
coverage but it does cover something
this is like a baked product so it's
very very finely milled and it just
glides on your face and it has I'm gonna
say this for every powder but it has a
little bit of a luminous sheen to it
those are the kind of powders I go for
since I have grow skin so I'm like
repeating myself
the next powder doesn't have a
luminosity though it doesn't have a
sheen this has kind of like a slight
glow to it I don't know how to explain
it it's matte I mean it's like if you
put on your face it will mattify you but
it's not a flat matte I don't know how
to explain it it's amazing and then the
last powder I have to share with you
guys blew my socks off I spoke about it
recently in a favorites video so I don't
want to go too in depth with it but I
see Charlotte Tilbury airbrushed
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder this is in the shade medium
this is the best powder ever I really
love this powder because there isn't a
sheen to it at all like it's not a
luminous it's not you know it is a matte
powder it will mattify you if you are
looking to do it duly dewy or oily is
what I meant to say you're looking to do
it if your oils are coming through
something this will mattify you it will
but in the most beautiful way possible
this like covers my pores it doesn't
emphasize my pores it doesn't emphasize
any texture any dryness
I was completely like I can be matte and
not look dead that's amazing because
matte on me doesn't work since my skin
is so dry like I've said 10 times but I
could just put this on the places where
I want to be matte and it looks flawless
like it literally looks like porcelain
skin
I do have an honorable mention really
quick that I want
mention and it is the Loreal okay I
can't speak today it is the laura
mercier a loose setting powder in the
shade translucent everybody and they
mama has been talking about this I got
the little one that you get like at the
checkout at Sephora because the big one
I was like man that's a lot of money for
a product I'm never gonna go through so
I got the little one and this is a great
powder this is a beautiful setting
powder that doesn't emphasize my dry
skin either but I just recently started
playing with it so I didn't want to
include it but I really have been liking
it so these are my favorite powders for
dry skin these are the powders that
really really work for my skin type
don't forget to leave me a comment down
below if you have a Holy Grail powder
from the drugstore and you have dry skin
and it works for you I would love to
know thank you guys so much for watching
