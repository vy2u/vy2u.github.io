another one in my favorite lip color
series you know that series I started
and then never never never finished I
did this video a while ago where I
showed you all of my favorite orange /
orange red lip products and I told you
guys in that video that I was gonna
start making this a series and I was
gonna do this with all the colors like
moms and nudes and reds and all the
other lip colors in the world
and I never got around to doing another
one I think it honestly just slipped my
mind
but the other day I got a comment on a
recent video from Evie Evie
if you're watching Evie I I'm not even
gonna try to say your last name because
I'm gonna butcher that but Evie pretty
much checked me she really did she was
letting me know about a couple videos I
said I wanted to turn into series and I
never did and this is one of them
another one was my best and worst of a
certain brand and I want to continue
that again so I am working on that for
today's video I'm gonna show you all of
my favorite red lip products lipsticks
like with lipsticks lip glosses all red
lip products because when I read that
comment I was like oh my gosh she's so
right there's a bunch of videos I said I
was gonna do and I still haven't done oh
my gosh I'm so sorry guys actually if
you can remind me in the comments videos
I've mentioned that I wanted to do and
that you've wanted to see and you
haven't seen them yet leave them down
below but anyway this video is similar
to my last one in this series will the
only one the only other one in this
series I'm gonna be showing you arm
swatches and then lip swatches as well
it's mainly gonna be a lip swatch video
I just feel like it's a lot more helpful
that way and a lot more straightforward
into the point but I'm gonna give you
guys information about the lip ease
throughout the video I'm gonna give you
prices and all of that it's gonna be on
the screen that way it is a little bit
more helpful and you're getting
information and not just looking at lip
swatches you know yeah anyway if you
want to see my favorite red lip ease
then just keep watching
okay guys so that completes this video
those are my favourite red lip products
and I know that the majority of them
were liquid lipsticks it's just that
when it comes to red I prefer a matte
long wearing formula I mean obviously
some of these were lipsticks and there
was even a couple lip glosses but
whenever I'm wearing a red I really
wanted to be a good formula and I love
and trust all of these products I
mentioned in this video today obviously
a lot of them did look similar it is a
bunch of reds but depending on the
undertone you want or the formula or
whatever I feel like you would find a
red you really like in this video so I
hope this video was helpful in some way
don't forget to leave me a comment down
below letting me know what color you
would like to see next and I will
totally I will totally do it let me know
down below pinks purples moms would moms
be purple I don't know just let me know
down below right just let me up yeah
