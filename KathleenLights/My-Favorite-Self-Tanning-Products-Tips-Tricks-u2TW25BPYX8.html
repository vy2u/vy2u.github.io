all about self tanning
my self tanning routine my favorite self
tanners quick little tips and tricks you
can do just all about self tanning
before I get started with the video I
have to give a disclaimer well I have to
give two disclaimers some people are
really offended by the thought of self
tanning or just offended by people whose
self tan I got a comment or I got a few
comments in recent videos saying that I
should just embrace my natural skin
color which I absolutely do
all the time most of the time I'm my
natural like very fair skin self that I
am tanned and I am not offended by my
fair skin I love my fair skin and I
always embrace it I just like to be 10
and that's just I like it I don't
understand why it bothers some people if
you don't like to self tan do not self
tan that is your life those are your
decisions this is my life these are my
decisions I just used to it's really bad
for you but I used to sit in the Sun all
the time like baked and like 10 like
that like when I was younger which is
such a big mistake you know
because about like skin cancer all the
bad things the Sun like being in the Sun
too long can cause for your skin so I
don't do that anymore so I turned to
self tanning because it is the healthy
way to beat an even tanning beds like
they're not good for you spray tans are
fine
I just haven't been able to find a place
around me that spray tans because I
would like to look at this bridge here
but anyway so I like to have nice tan
skin it makes me feel bronzy and summery
and I like it and I don't see the
problem in it so if you don't like
people who tan or don't like anything
about tanning or like tan skin then you
should click out of this video because
it is not for you
my other disclaimer is that this video
is not sponsored 100% not sponsored I'm
not getting paid to make this video I
wasn't asked to make this video you
actually I was asked you guys asked me
to make this video I've gotten tons of
questions about what I use to
self-tanning little tips and tricks I
can give you so here
so I'm quitting I will talk about the
tens I like the tans I like to use and
then I'll go into like little tips and
stuff I'm also going to tell you guys
about a couple of tens that I actually
don't like so the first one I want to
talk about is actually my absolute
favorite out of all the ones that I've
tried and I know that everyone has been
talking about this one and I hate you
guys know that I'm like you know Indy oh
no not a date you know I don't like to
fall into the hype of things but it's
really as incredible as everyone says it
is and it is the loving 10 deluxe
bronzing mousse instant bronze or a
self-tanner and moisturizer I have mine
an ultra dark this was sent to me
because this is like an overseas product
I think they're from Australia yes they
are but they're absolutely amazing they
do ship worldwide like they ship to the
United States and I do think it's worth
the money um if you're big on
self-tanning I'm not saying this is the
first one you're going to go out and try
but if you're big on self-tanning and
you've used a bunch I highly recommend
loving ten even if you are in the States
and you pay the extra shipping because
it's fantastic if the tan that I have on
my body right now and I'm a very very
fair very fair the color of paper I'm
very fair and this gets me nice and tan
without looking orange or looking green
or just looking strange it gives a
natural tan a beautiful natural tan as
if the Sun was tanning me I was very
blown away by the results actually the
first time that I did it and I had taken
that before-and-after picture I was like
holy crap it's beautiful because it's
that natural olive color and I like the
one in ultra dark they have like dark I
think they have light and stuff like
that but I like the one in ultra dark
because it makes you really dark but it
doesn't make you like so dark
you're like girl no so that's why I
highly recommend this one this one is my
favorite one out of all the ones I will
be talking about and this is the one
that I recommend the most but I will
talk about other words if you were on a
major major budget I highly recommend
these saint-maurice dark I bought this
on Amazon and I believe it was like
eight or nine dollars it was very
expensive this is like I have
repurchased this before because I think
it's really good it's the dupe for the
saint-tropez bronzing mousse I haven't
tried st. Tropez actually which maybe I
should but um I don't feel the need to I
don't feel the need to but I love it day
I get mine and dark again I prefer
getting the darkest of the darkest
because it does like wash off in the
shower
gradually it doesn't make you over the
top like I said it doesn't make you so
so dark that it looks strange the only
thing about this one is that it does not
last very long I get about three maybe
four days out of this one as opposed to
this that this is on my body for like a
good ten days ten or twelve days um I've
actually had this one on my body for
about five days now I've had this tan
and still going strong it still looks
good and it's been five days
this one doesn't last long at all but
for the price I really cannot complain
because it is so inexpensive so I mean
it doesn't matter that it doesn't last
as long but it gives good color right
away so I really really love that if you
have never self tan before this is the
one that I would go to first because
it's so inexpensive this is the first
tanner I ever bought um on that subject
I prefer mousses over anything else
because it has a color guard and a color
guard is just basically going to show
you the product as you're rubbing it in
um so I like that because you can get
really precise and it won't be as
streaky or won't be streaky at all um oh
the loving tan one actually has a really
good scent which I like some Tanner's
have that really intense self-tanning
scent and unfortunately the
saint-maurice is one of those that you
could really smell the self-tanner after
you've applied it and like you go lay
down you can really smell it this one
you can smell it you can't avoid that
self-tanner scent but this one is um
it's not as bad I don't smell that as
much so yeah another really good one
another favorite of mine is the Vita
Liberata they sell this at Sephora this
is a super deep
beautiful tan like I'm talking beautiful
deep such a luxurious tags really really
good like I highly recommend this one as
well um I just I love I love it love it
so much this is Giants just I'm just
throwing this in here just in case you
guys want some with the word from
diversity I really love Vida Liberata a
lot a lot so a lot really quickly I want
to talk about two that I'm on the fence
about a little me know one thing's mine
this is the million dollar ten mermaid
mousse extreme this was sent to me and I
don't love it yes I can Faneuil like
things that are sent to me I don't lie I
don't love it it gives a beautiful tan I
spent myself it gives a really really
really pretty channel what I stained my
finger how did that happen it gives a
beautiful ten once you apply it and it
does last a really good time but this
fades on me in the ugliest freakin way
ever this is super splotchy on me like
it fades in spot I don't know I don't
know if it's just me I know that for
awhile people raved about million
dollars Han but it the way that it fades
on me is not good so for that reason I
don't love it because I like it to fade
naturally and I find that these fade
naturally this one my favorite actually
I mean not my favorite another one that
I don't typically love I love the idea
of this but I just I don't love it this
is the ten cuticles CC self-tanning body
lotion in dark I wanted to love this
because this has really good skincare
benefits as well
it has acai berry mango butter vitamin E
it's super moisturizing like so so so so
so moisturizing it lips and it leaves a
natural color and it smells like
freaking coconuts oh my god this one
smells like banana boat it smells
amazing I don't really smell the
self-tanner scent but it doesn't have a
color guard because it's a lotion so
it's so hard for me to use it's not that
I don't like
I like it but it's so hard for me to use
because it's a lotion so like when I
wake up the next day in the morning I'm
like oh god it's a little bit streaky in
some areas because I can't see where I'm
putting it because it's just like a
moisturizer so I'm still going to work
with it a little bit more and try to see
if I could perfect the lotion but that
is why I prefer mousses cuz they're a
lot easier if you're a beginner I
definitely go with a mousse over a loved
one
okay so now I want to talk about two
products that aren't technically self
tanners but they're kind of and this is
the st. Tropez one-night-only instant
glow body lotion I got this in an Ipsy
bag and ever since I had gotten in if
Seebeck months ago like a year ago I
felt completely in love and I bought
like a full size this is literally like
a one night only thing this you put on
your body and you're instantly tan go
out party all night and then come home
and wash it off I do think it leaves
behind some color so I think you can get
away with you with like having this on
your body like two days maybe but I love
it because whenever I'm like oh my god I
want to look really bronzed in this
dress let me go grab my sink trope a
one-night-only lotion and apply it so
this isn't like a mousse or anything
this is literally like a bronze
moisturizer it's not clear it's not
white it's literally brown and I just
rub it in my fingers and I put it all
over my body and I like to do this like
three hours before I'm going to go out
because it can stain your clothes if you
don't put it on like three or four hours
before you go out it can stain but I
find that if I put it on like hours
before I'm fine I love this it gives me
like that Jennifer Lopez glow because it
is a little bit like bronzing and
sparkly not sparkly but it has like at
that bronze sheen but I freaking love I
love this and as for like a natural like
gradual tan I really love the Jergens
natural glow I get this at the drugstore
and what I like to do is I like to mix
this not makes this but I will apply
like my loving tan self-tanner mousse
and then every single day I'll apply
this just to prolong my tan
and once you start using this I realize
that my leg my tan can last up to two
weeks with this because it keeps that
like tanner in place it moisturizes your
skin which helps your tan last a lot
longer and it's just creating that
gradual tan so it like makes your 10th
day you can also use this without a
self-tanner and just use this every
single day and you'll notice like in
about a week and a half that you're
getting tanner by the day like it's
gradually tanning your skin which I
really love I get the one for medium to
tan skin tones just because the fair one
made me completely Orange like the fair
like the light to fair skin tones or
whatever made me Orange this one gives
me like a nice gradual tan a lot of
people ask me like oh so you turn your
body but you don't turn your face that's
super weird you go out of public like
that and yeah I got a boat like that
right I can um actually got this in my
boxycharm a couple months ago and I
haven't used this yet this is the tarte
maracuja bronzing serum it's for your
face and it's like gradually turns your
face I mentioned this because I want to
try the what is it the bare minerals
like full tan face or whatever so it's
like a tanner for your face it's meant
for your face because I want like my
whole body to match my face and the rest
of my body I'm not someone who wears
foundation every single day so I want
like it to match on a daily basis
so I want to know if you guys have tried
that bare minerals run did you break out
I have very sensitive skin but if it's
made for the face I hope it doesn't you
don't break you out so have you tried
that bare minerals full ten face one let
me know if it's good because I would try
it okay so for this video I'm not
demoing the process of me tanning since
I was already tan um and it was just so
requested recently but I will do a whole
demo if you guys walk to a leave me
comments down below if you would like me
to demo this process but the little tips
and tricks that I can give you is always
use a tanning glove you can get things
like at Sephora or Ulta whatever these
are the best because they don't stain
your hands you take them off and your
hands are not stained and nobody wants
stained hands so what I like to do is
take it on my left hand and I pump a
pump of the Moose and I start to massage
this and I go from my feet up people do
it differently but I like to go from my
feet up so I just rub it in my skin like
this you always want to do it in like
circular motions like this you kind of
want to rub like this cuz that blends
everything out and it gets right into
your skin that's the best way to do it
when I start coming up here I try to go
in like a smaller section so it doesn't
get streaky and I use like less product
as opposed to just pumping a lot onto
this thing and then just like passing it
over and like doing huge sections so you
get like streaks and in the places where
you place this so definitely a tanning
glove is essential because it helps with
the streakiness and it doesn't stain
your hands also a big tip I can give you
guys have you ever seen people who tan
and their Tanner is like really effed up
by the hands mine didn't come out
perfect this time but usually I'm pretty
good you see like this one came out like
I missed a spot here but usually my
hands come up pretty good when I tan my
hands and sometimes like you see people
with like really big blotchy parts of
their hand which is okay I mean mistakes
happen but what I like to do to avoid
that is I do that at the very very end
when I'm done panning my entire body and
they're still like Tanner on the actual
mint like the residue I will take it and
I will just lightly massage over my hand
in sections I won't do the palms on my
hand but I'll lightly go over my hand
and section in between my fingers wrap
my fingers in it and stuff like that
because I'm not applying tanner directly
to my hand and that's what gives you
that weird splotchy hand look I'm just
putting like the leftover tan so it's a
very soft version of the tan since
you're not applying tan directly to your
hands that makes sense I don't know I
used to get this blotchiness and I used
to be really ugly until I figured out
that that is the best way to do it for
me so that I can get nice
natural-looking hands okay so besides a
mitt or a little glove I highly
recommend a body scrub
a thick body butter this is what's going
to make your tan not only last longer
but apply evenly on the skin a lot of
people are like oh my god every time I
tan I look like like I have spots
everywhere it doesn't look natural it
looks really bad these are the two key
elements in self-tanning so this is my
favorite body scrub it's from the
drugstore really inexpensive it's the
shea sugar body scrub and I get mine and
coconut line because it smells wonderful
this is a sugar body scrub
I like these more than like soft body
scrubs because I feel like they're more
moisturizing and I pretty much exfoliate
my entire body in the shower so that's
the first thing I do I get in the shower
and I exfoliate everything out I scrub
deep down all over my body and you're
going to want to exfoliate before you
tan because you're really going to get
rid of all the dead skin when you put
like a mousse tan on your spot on your
body without exfoliating it's going to
cling on to all the dead skin and it's
going to look really splotchy and really
uneven so you definitely want to most
importantly exfoliate your skin before
self-tanning and it's just gonna go on
beautifully it's just going to glide on
your skin and also you're going to want
to use a body butter like a thick body
butter and you're going to want to hit
those like key points like I like to get
a little shower after I've said
exfoliating and I'll take this this is
from the blissful body I will link her
Etsy below this is like the most amazing
freakin body butter ever it's so thick
and moisturizing and perfect and I love
it it sinks into the skin it's just
magical so I like to take a little bit
of this and I'll rub it on my elbows my
knuckles my knees any of those places
because we're skin is really dry the
mousse is going to cling to it so if you
have super dry skin when you're dry
everywhere
then go ahead and slather some
moisturizer everywhere if you want I
just honestly recommend doing those key
points just like your elbows your
knuckles and stuff like that because I
find that if I put moisturizer my entire
body and then I apply the self-tanner
I'm super sticky for like hours after
that but that is how I avoid getting
like splotchy in those areas where you
tend to get splotchy like the
and the knuckles and those weird places
is because I apply a body butter before
I apply the self-tanner another thing I
recommend is doing it at nighttime
before you go to bed there's a bunch of
tanners I think Lovington has like a two
hour tan thing that in two hours you're
perfectly tanned I like putting it on
before bed and just sleeping through it
and then waking up in the morning and
taking a shower because once you apply
the mousse once it has fully developed
it still looks a little dirty because
you haven't showered you definitely want
to shower after your tan has fully
developed like after a good night's
sleep like seven hours or whatever then
you shower and then the tan looks really
pretty and it has like all that excess
tan just falls right off and it looks a
lot more natural I definitely recommend
going to sleep in like loose clothing so
you don't stay in any of your clothes
with that loving tan I go to sleep right
away and I don't really stay in any of
my clothes but then again I go to sleep
and like baggy clothes and stuff like
that so yeah that is what I recommend
and those are my favorite
tanning mousses again if you want a demo
