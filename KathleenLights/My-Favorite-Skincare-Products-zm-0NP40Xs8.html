my skincare routine in a way I'm not
really going to go and demonstrate my
morning skincare routine and my
nighttime skincare routine because I've
done that before but I decided to go
ahead and grab all of my favorite
skincare products and talk about them
today and I thought what better way to
do that than to come at you barefaced I
don't have any makeup on except mascara
and tinted brow gel but besides that I
have nothing on my face which is rare
because I cannot live without under-eye
concealer I just feel like if I'm going
to talk about my favorite skincare
products to you guys I want you guys to
see my skin I want you guys to see the
condition of my skin and everything like
that because we are not talking about
makeup in this video we are not wearing
any masks today I do really quickly want
to talk to you guys about my skin type
because I feel like these products work
really well for my skin I have dry a
sensitive skin and a lot of you guys
know that this summer it's more like
normal to dry but in the winter it is
bone bone dry and I have a super super
dry t-zone most people get oily in the
t-zone the Sahara Desert girl the Sahara
pin is very very sensitive and when I
mean sensitive I don't mean I am acne
prone whenever a product reacts badly to
my skin I have a really bad like texture
issue skin will start to feel really
really bumpy and like super super rough
it's the strangest thing and my main
problem area is my forehead I have those
weird white bumps that are like
underneath the skin and I know that
there's something called Melia and I
don't know exactly if I have Melia but
it's really really similar to Melia and
it happens a lot if I wear too much
makeup or if I wear makeup too many days
in a row I will get that underneath my
skin from clogged pores and just like
all the layers of makeup on my skin so
because of that exfoliating is my best
friend will say it's not good to
exfoliate everyday but I exfoliate
probably five times a week because if I
don't my skin would be horrible I
remember I went a whole week without
exfoliating and my pores were so clogged
there were bumps all over my face it's
bad I have to exfoliate often that's
just the skin I have and also with dry
skin it's really really necessary to
exfoliate and I
you get pimples but they are like the
big ones that hurt like the painful ones
that come out of nowhere that happens
often and usually if a product breaks me
out like that it's going to be in this
area right here I know if I have pimples
right here that a product a specific
product did that to my face anyway
enough rambling I just quickly wanted to
tell you like the skin issues I have and
what type of skin I have and all that
good stuff
oh when it comes to skin care honestly I
believe in investing in good skin care I
don't get me wrong there are really good
skin care products at the drugstore but
I personally feel like you should invest
in a really good skin care because
taking care of your skin is really
really important and I rather spend $50
on a moisturizer than $50 on a
foundation you know what I mean I'm just
trying to say that I really do save my
money and go out and invest in really
good skin care products because I feel
like it's important I just wanted to
quickly mention that just in case
anybody sees certain things and they're
like girls s expensive now I'm gonna be
like yeah girl but dess worth it okay so
I'm going to start off with how I remove
my makeup I found that the ultimate the
best best best makeup remover in the
entire world is coconut oil this is what
works best for me it does such a good
job of breaking down my mascara and
eyeliner and certain things that are
hard to take off with just regular face
wash really does such an amazing job and
it does not irritate my skin and because
it's coconut oil it's going to be really
moisturizing as well there are some
people with oily acne prone skin break
out with this but I've never had any
problems and I have sensitive skin so
yeah this is really inexpensive and it's
the best makeup remover I've ever used
now really quickly I want to talk about
my favorite face washes I have used many
face washes in my lifetime and these are
three that I consider Holy Grail
products the first one is by philosophy
and it is called the purity I'm sure you
guys have seen this all over YouTube
people rave about it for a good reason
it is such a great face wash to take off
makeup and to really deep clean your
skin this is the face wash I use every
single night it stays in my shower and
when I get in my shower I wash my face
with this
and if I'm not using this I find that
this does a really good job on its own
it breaks down my makeup really well and
it just cleans everything and this does
foam up just a little bit on my skin
but it doesn't strip my skin and it
doesn't make it feel really tight and
dry another face wash I really love this
is like my holy grail morning face wash
it is by the brand fresh and it is their
soy face cleanser this kind of looks
like a gel consistency and it has a very
very strong smell of cucumbers so if you
don't like the smell of cucumbers you
are going to absolutely hate this I
first to kind of put me off I would put
on my face and I'm like oh it smells
like cucumbers but I actually enjoy this
scent now this is such a great face wash
for sensitive skin does say it's for all
skin types but it's so good it really
really moisturizes my face and even
though it doesn't remove makeup as well
as purity it does a pretty good job of
removing makeup and it's just really
really gentle and creamy and beautiful
so amazing I love using this in the
morning because just the smell of
cucumbers it just wakes me up I really
love this and then the other one I
really want to mention I don't use this
one every single day but it's definitely
part of my skin care it is the John
masters organics jojoba and ginseng
exfoliating face cleanser and I use this
every so often when my skin is super
super clogged up in my pores are just
like not doing so well and I have to
exfoliate and use this to really really
clean my face this is a cream cleanser
that does such a good job of
moisturizing as well but it has tiny
little beads throughout the cleanser and
it's not a bunch of beads to where you
feel it's super grainy
it's like sparingly throughout the
cleansers like the exfoliation and this
is really really mild but I like it
because it's just that extra oomph okay
so my favorite toner I finally found a
toner that does not break me out my skin
is extremely sensitive to toners but
this one by Faiers has not broken me out
yet I've had it for like two months I
want to say a little bit more and it is
their alcohol-free toner
unscented witch hazel with aloe vera
formula stuff is great it comes in a
bunch of different scents peach rose
lavender but I got unscented just in
case since my skin is so since
to toners it looks like I haven't used
anything but a little goes a long way I
just pour some onto my cotton pad and I
rub this on my entire face and it tones
my face but it does not strip my skin it
doesn't leave my skin feeling dry I feel
like a lot of toners really dry out your
skin but this one doesn't I guess with
the aloe vera formula it's just really
really great for sensitive skin okay so
I want to mention my all-time favorite
spot treatment whenever I have one of
those really big pimples that hurts and
it's puffy and you know I use a
spot treatment on those and my favorite
one is the origins super spot remover
acne treatment gel with salicylic acid
this is this big look at the size of
this it was a pretty expensive bottle
for the size it was 15 dollars but but a
little goes such a long way that I feel
like I will never go through this is
basically salicylic acid that's all it
is my skin reacts really well to
salicylic acid and right before bed I
will just barely tap my finger in this
and place it right on the blemish I make
sure to get it right on the blemish
because this will dry out my skin
because it's just straight-up cells like
acid and then when I wake up it's almost
100% gone it is definitely so much
flatter than it was the night before
it's incredible this stuff is so
powerful has such an amazing job of
getting rid of my really big like nasty
pimples you know that time with a month
girl
and by the way origins is probably my
ultimate favorite skincare brand in the
entire world is a little bit pricey but
I have never seen a product do such good
things for me then all of the origins
products I've purchased amazing brand
okay so now I'm going to talk about my
favorite nighttime moisturizer and I
will never ever as long as I continue to
make this by another nighttime
moisturizer in my life this is such holy
grail status like out of all of my
skincare products this is the one that
has made the biggest difference on my
skin is the origins high-potency
vitamins mineral enriched to renewal
cream this is what it looks like it is
like magic and cream in a pot like I
said earlier I have those weird flesh
colored bumps that happen underneath my
skin and whenever I put this
on at nighttime and I wake up to lot
smoother it's a lot like
youthful-looking and my bumps have
gotten smaller it's crazy I don't know
what's in this stuff but whatever it is
a little goes a long way as well this is
what it looks like it's like a thick
cream but it's not too thick on my skin
and I feel like people with oily skin
will like this as well because it's not
super greasy or weird but it does
hydrate your skin well I have never
broken out to this it doesn't clog my
pores some moisturizers really clog my
pores this doesn't this is just now I'm
going to talk about eye creams I have
tried so many eye creams like in the
last six months looking for the perfect
one and I have found it this is the
origins again origins starting over AG
racing eye cream with mimosa it's like
an anti-aging eye cream and I find that
it is doing a really good job of just
smoothing out my lines especially around
here like my crow's feet type of area it
just makes things so much smoother and I
feel like the anti-aging benefits are
working it's really good I haven't been
using it for so so long but so amazing
already and then I quickly want to give
an honorable mention to my Antipodes
Kiwi seed oil eye cream I use this when
my skin is really really dry like so dry
because honestly out of all the eye
creams I have ever used in my life
nothing hydrates my under eyes like this
stuff I don't know what it is but a
little goes such a long way you barely
have to tap your finger into this stuff
when you wake up your your under eyes
still feel a little moist and just
really really hydrated so when my under
eyes are feeling really creepy and
wrinkly and like dry desert II I go for
this because it is hi gyrating now I
want to talk about my favorite serum and
honestly this isn't like my favorite
Holy Grail serum oh but it works it is
the l'oreal youth code texture Perfector
serum concentrate it's really good at
smoothing out your texture which is the
problem I have your skin feels really
really really soft when you put this on
and it works well underneath makeup I
use this more during the daytime I don't
really use it at night you
I feel like my nighttime routine works
really well I'm still on the hunt for
that perfect serum that I can't live
without which I'm going to buy the Lin
edge water bank serum I know Nicole if
you're watching this I know call from
young wild and polish raves about that
like if she gave birth to it so I'm
definitely a try out that serum but this
is a good one if you were looking for a
drugstore one or you know okay so the
next product I want to talk about is
very very very essential to me
especially because I have dry skin and
it is argan oil I use 100% argan oil on
my face I will lather my face in this
and go to bed when I'm not using this
guy I will lather my face in this and go
to bed and when I wake up my skin is as
soft as a baby's bottom it feels so
great just make sure you are getting
100% argan oil this is from the brand
John masters organics I love this brand
it's really good and I used to buy the
Josie Maran one but this one is cheaper
and it's the exact same product
they're both argan oil so I'm buying
this one from now on and I love it if
you have dry skin oily skin any type of
skin it is really really good to use
argan oil on your face ok so I mentioned
earlier that I exfoliate my face a lot I
use a bunch of different products I use
a lot of microdermabrasion exfoliators
and certain things like that I'm always
switching out my exfoliator but one that
I always come to and I use this one
about three times a week it is holy
grail status and so inexpensive it is
the st. Ives blemish control green tea
scrub this is the only one I like from
st. Ives because that apricot scrub from
st. Ives scratches the crap out of my
skin I think I used it once at a
friend's house I was taking a shower and
that's the only exfoliator she had and
I'm just broke my face this one isn't
like that it's super super gentle but
finely milled a bunch of a bunch of
little little little exfoliators it's
great and it also has 1% salicylic acid
so it helps fight my breakouts a lot by
the way I forgot to mention this but my
all-time favorite thing to wash my face
with is cognac sponges I don't use my
fingers because I feel like a cognac
sponge really does a job and I don't use
things like a Clarisonic because my skin
is so sensitive
I really don't want to and I don't have
a brush for sensitive skin and all that
Boniek sponges have worked wonders on my
skin because they're mild exfoliator
Zhaan these are like under ten dollars
as long as you keep it hanging in your
bathroom and nothing really touches it
and you chuck these out like every three
months you won't get any bacteria in
these it's so really quickly my favorite
daytime moisturizers I really love the
Antipodes rejoice like facial day cream
this is what I use whenever I'm going to
be wearing makeup because it moisturizes
my skin without feeling greasy and even
though I have dry skin I don't like that
greasy feeling on my face throughout the
day especially when I'm going to put
some foundation on top this one just
really really absorbs into my skin but
it immediately feels so so soft and
hydrated it's amazing and it like
disappears instantly it's a great great
moisturizer and whenever I'm not going
to be wearing makeup
I just want something on the go I use my
origins vytas inge SPF 15 energy
boosting moisturizer with mangosteen
says SPF 15 so it's perfect for the
daytime and what I love about this is
the fact that it is tinted it's not a
tinted moisturizer but it does have a
little bit of a tint to it it comes out
white and then when you blend it into
your skin I don't know if you'll be able
to tell when you blend it into your skin
it does have a little bit of color so I
find that it evens out my skin tone if
you have really really fair skin it
might go a little bit warm on your skin
by the way I get all of my origins
products at origins calm because they
have so many coupon codes going all the
time just Google origins coupon code and
you'll find great one okay so those were
all my skincare favorites and now I'm
going to talk about my favorite part and
it is my favorite face masks I do have
eight to share with you guys with one
honorable mention so let's get started
by the way I know this video is going to
be super long but I'm first going to
talk about my favorite clarifying masks
like the ones that are really going to
pull things out of your pores and the
first one I want to talk about is really
inexpensive and you can find this at
Target and it is the boots botanics
iconic clay mask
delete removes impurities and deeply
cleanses with clarifying willow bark
this stuff is amazing really dry skin
and sometimes clay masks just kill my
skin and make them so incredibly dry
because they're so thick and hard and
it's really hard to deal with but this
is the most impo an easy to use clay
mask I don't even know how to explain it
when I first used it and I saw that the
consistency was so watery I was kind of
blown away it's not like really really
thick and hard to put on your face and
you have like chunks everywhere and hard
to blend out it is so smooth you apply
this to your fingers and just swipe on
your face and it applies everywhere
evenly if you're looking for a really
good clay mask for any skin type oily
skin even the driest of skin this will
more work for you because it's not going
to strip your skin it's definitely going
to make your skin feeling a little bit
dry because it's a clay mask but it's
really really smooth the next one what
are we talking about is the exact
opposite of that and it is the most
powerful product I've ever put on my
face if you are thinking of buying the
glam glow face mask the super mud not
the youth mud or the thirsty mud I think
those are incredible but the super mud
do not waste your money because I found
something just as good maybe maybe
better and it is the health and beauty
as tech secret Indian healing clay
world's most powerful facial they're not
kidding deep pore cleansing 100% natural
calcium bentonite clay I got mine off I
got this off I herb for really
inexpensive because I have dry skin I do
have to follow up with my John masters
argan oil whenever I use this I applied
this right after and I'm telling you
that when I wake up the next day I have
better skin that I've ever had in my
life this is the most intense clay mask
you will ever come across it is a powder
so you have to dump it in a bowl and
then mix it with apple cider vinegar and
the reason you use apple cider vinegar
is because it's going to help fight
breakout so you can mix this with water
but it's going to be a little bit
thicker and chunkier to use if you mix
it with apple cider vinegar it makes it
really
easy-to-use at it and it's more
beneficial but this stuff is so powerful
that my face hurts the entire time that
this is on it's not like I'm in pain
kind of feeling it's like a what is
happening kind of feeling feel my face
pulsate and I thought it was joking
because it literally says feel your face
pulsate and I was like okay no no you
absolutely do just a warning this stuff
will pull out things you didn't know you
had in your face okay so this next one
is a charcoal face mask it's not a mud
mask this charcoal is really good to
just draw out impurities from in your
pores like if your pores are really
really clogged this is just going to act
like a magnet and pull stuff out and I
love the origins clear improvement
active charcoal mask to clear pores this
stuff is great for any skin type it
works really really well and that's
basically what I use it for just to give
my pores an extra deep clean and I'm not
sensitive to this one some face masks
really really break me out like the
majority of the face masks at the
drugstore duh they do not work for my
skin but this one this one works and
then this one is my honorable mention
that I was talking about and it is the
mint julep mask by clean hÃ©lÃ¨ne helps
dry up acne pimples rinse away
blackheads and shrink enlarged pores if
you have oily skin by this it works
really really well I'm not saying that
people with dry skin can't use this
because I do use this sometimes can be a
little bit drying I'm not gonna lie
something about the mint in this that
really makes my face feel really clean
and refreshed and I typically only use
this like around my nose or I use this
as a spa treatment
whenever I don't want to use salicylic
acid on my pimples for whatever reason I
will just go is squeeze some out of this
and then use it on my pimples and use it
as a spot treatment and it works really
well for that and I think this is like
three dollars so it's a good face mask
like a mud like a mud type of face mask
from the drugstore that doesn't break me
out I quickly want to talk about
probably my favorite face mask of all
time or one of my favorite face masks
for sure and it is the glam glow youth
mud tingle exfoliate treatment I have
their little jar this is the twenty
dollar one cuz I use this one once a
week maybe twice at my skin
has like a really weird texture to it
but this stuff is great I don't think
that the white one is worth it and I
know that's everyone's favorite that's
like everyone's Holy Grail but I think
that this one works just as good but
this one is so unique because it is a
meta mask but it's an exfoliating mud
mask my sister used it for the first
time she was like I need to buy that
because my skin felt amazing the next
day it's just great I use this one when
my skin really really needs to pick me
up and I will just apply it all over my
face leave it on for a few minutes and
then get in the shower and really warm
it up with the steam and then buff it
into my skin because it is an exfoliator
so it does such a good job of
exfoliating my skin it's like the best
skin exfoliator ever and it does smell
really good at least to me it does but
it is very leafy there are like tree
branches in here and like leaves in this
thing but it's so great I definitely
recommend this if you're looking for a
great exfoliator slash mask I don't know
it's a really good hybrid I love this
I'm also a really big fan of the glam
glow thirsty mud by the way it's amazing
for dry skin for all skin types I don't
have it I constantly get samples of it
but I do want to buy I do think that one
is worth the $70 I wish they had that
one in like a little pot like this
because I would just buy this but they
don't they only have this one in a small
that one is amazing to the next mask I
want to talk about is the Antipodes aura
manuka honey mask this is a clarifying
mask but it is really really hydrating
when you pour onto your fingers it is
like a cream like a thick creamy texture
that you would think it's just like a
thick moisturizer it's so weird and then
when you apply it to your whole face it
feels like sticky it doesn't feel like
it's going to dry but it does it does
take a little bit longer to dry than say
a mask like this like a mud mask because
it is hydrating too so I leave this on
for about 20 minutes and then when you
touch your face you see that it really
does Harden and it's just so cool I love
this mask one of my favorite masks for
sure because I feel like it's clarifying
it does a really good job of like
pulling out stuff from my pores and
cleaning my face but hydrate my skin
makes it
really really soft and supple so great
and the honey in this is really going to
help fight break out it has that like
bacteria fighting ingredient in here and
it's just so great for sensitive skin
and oh my god I love this one of the
best Antipodes products I have ever used
okay so this next mask is not a
clarifying mask it is a hydrating mask
and it is the origins
drink up intensive overnight mask to
quench skins thirst you put this all
over your face and then you go to bed
and when you wake up you have a brand
new face basically it smells really
really good it smells like fruits like
ah smells so good but this is a great
mask if you don't want to spend the
money on the glam glow thirsty mud
because this one is cheaper but it does
a similar job it is a hydrating mask
it's really going to quench the skin's
thirst when I feel like my skin is just
dry and dull and like has no life to it
I kind of look like it just doesn't look
as healthy as it usually does I will
apply this mask and when I wake up I'm
like wow my skin looks great this is the
perfect mask to use like the night
before a special event because it's
really just gonna make your skin look
healthier more luminous and beautiful I
love this mask okay guys so those were
all my favorite skin care products I
know this video is really long but I
just really want to talk about all the
things I really love and these are
serious staples in my skincare routine I
don't use every single product every
single day but they're staples for sure
so yeah that's it thank you guys so much
