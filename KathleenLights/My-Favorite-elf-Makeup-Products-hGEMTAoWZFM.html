a highly requested video I have been
promising this video for like the last
two weeks or more I'm going to be
talking about all of my favorite
products from the brand elf eyes lips
face elf you can find elf at Target and
actually I'm now I think that you can
find elf at different other places
besides Target but mainly target or eyes
lips face comm I will link the website
down below like the elf website below
but I was thinking about doing this
video and I thought to name it like best
of elf but then I realized that
everybody's opinions different everybody
sees make up differently certain things
that I love you guys
maybe hate and vice versa so I decided
to just call it like my favorite elf
products these are the products that I
really love from elf also I wanted to
just kind of do a video of all the
things I liked like I was just gonna
bring together a bunch of things from
out that I liked and then I thought no
cuz that video would be so long this
video is probably gonna be long anyway
but I thought it would be too long to
just talk about a million things that I
like so I narrowed it down to things
that I absolutely love from the brand
things that I think are so good that I
can't believe they're so inexpensive
things that I highly highly recommend so
that's what this video is going to be
about there's actually tons of other
things from elf that I truly enjoy using
but these are like my favorite favorite
favorite products slowly grow elf
products so I'm going to go ahead and
get started
um if you guys watch my channel you guys
know this already but I think that elf
makes top quality baked products like
their baked products are my all-time
favorite products elf makes and I'm
going to start off with their baked
highlighters
I think the elf makes amazing
highlighters another reason why I think
they're so good is because I haven't
come across many highlighters at the
drugstore that are really really nice
except maybe Physicians Formula I said
that weird Physicians Formula but
they're baked highlighters from oh
they're amazing
favorite favorite one is this one right
here in moonlight pearl this is what it
looks like it's a very beautiful like
champagne ish whitish kind of color it
looks great on fair-skinned it's very
intense
but you could just add a really light
layer and not get it so intense the
thing with bates products is that you
have to use them what to get the
intensity that you want but these
highlighters I do not use them wet I
don't need to use them what they are
fantastic but one that I realized that I
loved so much for highlighting is
actually one of their baked blushes this
is probably my favorite thing to use for
highlighting when it comes to elf and it
is their baked blush in pink tastic it
has like little pink things all
throughout it compared to the other
baked eyeliners this one is the one that
has the best formula like this blush
because it's very very finely milled and
it's like super slick super smooth it's
the highlighter I have on my face right
now I love this baked blush in pink
tastic their baked bushes are also
really good if you're into like glowy
cheeks I also really love their baked
bronzers I don't have one to share with
you because it's in my makeup bag in my
purse because I use it on the go I love
it so much but definitely check out
their baked bronzers they have a couple
different shades and they are really
good because they don't have glitter
they're like a matte but since they're
baked it's like a nice glowy look
without hat without adding a sheen if
that makes sense by the way please
excuse my hair oh my god it's so bad
looking in the viewfinder I didn't
realize it was this bad anyway more
baked products I am crazy about are
their baked eyeshadows now these things
I do recommend using them wet just to
get like the full intensity and they
have a bunch of different colors I have
like the majority of them but these are
my two absolute favorites this one isn't
oh stood and it actually is a dupe for
Urban Decay's eyeshadow in toasted I
don't know if it doesn't on purpose but
this is a dupe for it it's a beautiful
beautiful topi pinky color I definitely
recommend using this one wet and the
other one I really love is burnt plum
it's like a
and berry color a little purple eNOS to
it it's really pretty this one actually
I don't use wet you can it looks a lot
better wet but I've used it dry actually
have this in my crease dry so when use
it dry it just gives you like a really
soft color it's amazing I really love
these too definitely recommend these
baked eyeshadows from ELF they're
amazing
the elf high definition under eye
setting powder now I don't use this in
my videos I don't think I've ever used
this in one of my videos but it's
amazing it's really really good
at first I didn't like it because it has
tiny little glitters in it and that just
really threw me off but it is really
pretty unreflective underneath the eye
it's really nice to set your under-eye
concealer because it bright ends up
underneath the eyes I don't know if you
can tell but it's good stuff but if
you're going to use this to take
pictures I don't recommend it because it
does kind of give like a little bit of a
white cast because it is like that HD
powder but I find that for under the
eyes it doesn't really matter since you
kind of want your under eyes to be
bright but this is really good stuff
I recommend this if you want a bright
beautiful like glowing under eye setting
powder I am crazy about their pressed
mineral blushes I love them I highly
recommend them I think they are amazing
amazing amazing quality
these two are my absolute favorite they
have four but these two are the best
this is Cabo Cabana and this one is
sweet retreat they're so good they're
very very pigmented and they last a
pretty good time on my cheeks like they
are so pigmented I am NOT a fan of their
studio blushes I know a lot of people
like them I'm not a fan they're very
powdery they're kind of chalky they
don't last on my skin don't like them
but when you put your finger into this
product it's just so so smooth you know
there's no patchiness with this it's a
great elf blush and it's a great blush
in general I recommend these 20 times
over their studio blushes if you're
looking for a good inexpensive blush the
mineral blushes are the are the way to
go staying with blush I've tried every
single one of these duo's from ELF every
single one and these are the two that I
and the most these are the two that are
my favorite and it's actually Fiji the
original their original duel where they
tried to copy like NARS Laguna and NARS
orgasm I was kind of like them copying
it this one is my favorite they've come
out with a bunch of other ones after
this but the original is pans down my
favorite this bronzer is very pigmented
you have to be crazy careful with it
look at that that is a brown but if you
use a super super light hand like a
stippling brush or something like that
then it's it's a really good bronzer
especially when you're tan like in the
summertime just dust this really lightly
on the cheeks and it's a really nice
bronzer this blush is actually really
really nice too it's not my favorite
because it does kind of have like that
texture of those studio blushes I really
like the color and I like the undertone
overall and my other favorite one is
actually Fiji as well but the matte
version this is a newer release 2l they
wanted to do a blush and bronzer duo
that was completely matte and I love it
I love this blush for the fall time this
blush is actually very smooth nothing
like their original studio blushes I
don't know I guess they've like been
changing the formula but this is so
gorgeous it's a really nice fall color I
don't typically put on blushes that are
this color but it's very very pretty and
this bronzer is really nice too very
easy to blend it's a little bit warm so
it's not very great for contouring I
mean you definitely can contour with it
it's matte but it's more of a warm
bronzer it's something you could like
dust all over your face it's really good
I love Fiji in both the matte and the
original version okay so another top
favorite of mine are these elf smudge
pots these things are a dollar each I
believe I'm someone who really really
enjoys their studio line they're my
favorite it's the three dollar line but
they also have like a mineral line and
an essential line the essential line is
one dollar I believe it's called a
central line I'm not exactly sure but
the essential line is a dollar and I
don't typically love all of their
products that are only
the dollar but these smudge pots are so
incredible they're very similar to the
Maybelline Color tattoos or to the Mac
Paint Pots only a lot creamier they're
not as like stiff as those I love them
because they are great cream eyeshadows
they stay on your eyes and they don't
budge for the entire day they're really
good for that and they're also great eye
shadow bases they're great eye shadow
primers since on me they don't crease
and they last such a long time you could
put this on your eyelids and then add
some eyeshadow on top and your eye
shadow is good to go for the rest of the
day they have a bunch of different
colors and these two are my top
favorites this one is in Cruzan cheek
it's a really gorgeous
taupe color just like really I highly
recommend this one this one's my top one
but I also really really love brownie
points it's that warm coppery brown
color that you guys know I'm crazy about
I highly recommend these if you haven't
checked these out definitely check them
out if you like those Maybelline Color
tattoos try these because they're only a
book okay so I know you guys saw this
coming from a mile away these are the
elf prism eyeshadow palette I've talked
about these about a hundred times
already on my channel and I've done
looks with both the Naked palette and
the sunset palette out of all the
eyeshadows I've ever tried from ELF
these are hands-down the best eye
shadows I have ever used even better
than their baked eyeshadows these do not
need to be wet to use you can if you wet
them they're even more intense but this
one is in the shade naked and it's my
favorite one
it has beautiful gold chocolatey colors
these are so highly pigmented that I
feel like I'm putting a high-end
eyeshadow on my eyelids it's one of my
favorites it's up there with my eye
shadow palettes even when I'm not
talking about elf when I'm just talking
about eye shadow in general this is one
of my favorite palettes hands down and
that's saying a lot because I have a lot
of high-end palettes this is a great
palette and if you're into colorful
stuff this one is a good one too I don't
think this one is as good as this one
but it's still nice if you're into fun
colors like that they have another one
that has more like silvery blackish kind
of colors but these two are the ones
that I just gravitate towards I
you recommend these these are $10 each
so it's a little bit more expensive but
I highly recommend them they're worth
every single penny okay so I have to
talk about their brushes the elf studio
brushes are hands down one of the best
drugstore brushes all around their
studio brushes are three dollars each
and there are worth every penny I'm
going to talk about a couple ones that I
truly love this is the elf complexion
brush this is my favorite studio brush
it's like tapered this way and it's
amazing to contour the cheeks like to
give it more of a natural contour so
just bronze your face this is also
really great to just powder your face
dip it into some powder and just powder
your face it's amazing for that this is
a great brush I've washed it multiple
times and I don't get any shedding with
this actually haven't gotten any
shedding with any of these studio
brushes I love this one
this is the elf mineral powder brush I
use it for contouring I use it to
contour today to get like a more precise
contour and I really really like it I
didn't think I was going to have any use
for this brush this is the blush brush
but it's perfect perfect for highlight I
use it to highlight my face today and
then this one is hands down one of the
best brushes in the world this is the
elf small tapered brush and I used this
to set my under eye concealer so I love
these two brushes right here these are
eye brushes and they're both fairly new
this one is the elf blending brush it
reminds me of the Mac 217 it's not as
good but it's three dollars and then
this one is the elf crease crease brush
it's just like I kind of small so it's
really easy to get like very very
precise with so I really enjoy those
brushes and the only brush that I
actually really like from their $1 line
is this right here regular just flat
shadow brush it just says professional
eye shadow brush this is amazing
I've tried they're $1.00 brushes before
but they shed on me this one doesn't
shed on me though it's really really
nice and it's perfect to just pack color
on the entire lid I had
commend that you can't lose it's $1 and
it's actually really nice these are the
elf long-lasting lustrous eyeshadows
these are a cream shadow but they're not
like the smudge pots these are like a
moussey texture you put your finger in
and then you take your finger out and it
stays dented that way it's the strangest
feeling ever it's definitely a MOSI
consistency not a cream but these are
really great eyeshadow Stoppers or just
an all-over I shadow
they're really good actually you want to
have on my eyelids today is this one
that's that gold sparkly color you see
on the inner half of the lid
it's a beautiful sparkly color I'm
pretty sure this is called toast
the only thing that sucks about this is
that the name is nowhere on the
packaging it comes on the actual box
like when you buy this hi Cheryl the
name is on the box but once you throw
that box away you don't know the name
anymore so it sucks I really love this
goldish color believe it's called toast
and I believe that this one is also
called like pomegranate or party or
something like that this is another one
that I truly love it's like a cranberry
purple color and it looks beautiful all
over the lid on top of eyeshadow I have
to do is dunk your finger in and just
press it on the lid I don't like these
with a brush I feel like you get the
most intensity with your finger so I
just kind of poked my finger in and just
stamped it right on the lid and it gets
a beautiful like glittery beautifulness
one more mineral product I really really
love their pressed mineral bronzers this
one is my favorite one this was in the
shade tan toffee and I love it these are
very pigmented but they're very smooth
when I tell you like smooth to the touch
they are smooth really comparable to the
blushes I mean they're the same thing
the mineral bronzer and the mineral
blush but they're so easy to blend out
this is what I have to contour my face
today it's amazing I reach for this all
the time even when I don't want to do
drugstore looks that's saying a lot okay
we're just getting to the end I have two
more things to share with you guys and I
feel like there are two things that
don't get talked about a lot at all on
YouTube the first one are the elf custom
calm
I think these are fantastic they look
like this I took some eyeshadows out I
had a MAC eyeshadow Zin here but I took
it out because i depotted all my MAC
eyeshadow into one palette but it comes
with a mirror and four little spaces for
four different eyeshadows what what did
you think excuse me excuse me it's
getting feisty it's getting really
feisty what's amazing about this is that
it comes with the perfect size to put
makeup geek eyeshadows Mac eyeshadows so
I love using this for traveling because
it comes with a pretty big mirror and
whenever I want to make like a custom
quad like okay let's say I'm going
somewhere for the weekend I'm traveling
and I don't need that many eyeshadows
I'll just take four of my favorite
makeup geek eyeshadows and I'll plop
them right in here and then I have this
to go this is one dollar people one
dollar and the last thing I truly love
and adore is the elf glitter primer I
believe this is also one dollar this is
one of the best glitter primers I've
ever used and it's a dollar it's very
comparable to the two-faced glitter
primer leaves your eyelids super tacky
which is what you want because if you're
gonna apply a glitter on top you want it
to really really stick so that you don't
get fallout all over your face this is
very tacky very sticky you put it on
your eyelids and the second you put
anything on top it sticks immediately so
it's perfect for pigments and glitter if
you have a pigment that you get a lot of
fallout with I highly recommend this elf
glitter primer because you won't have
fallout any more let me tell you okay
guys so that completes this video I
really wanted to just talk about the
things that I love and adore Holy Grail
products that I think are worth you
checking out thank you for watching I
really hope you enjoyed this video leave
