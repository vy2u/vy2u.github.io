cat tips today it is one like no other
obviously about Ted on this video you
guys know I'm gonna be talking about my
first clubbing experience I recently
went to Las Vegas which a lot of you
know and we went to the club before I
get into this video when I dress my
shirt my friend Gabby got me this shirt
it's amazing hello
this one doesn't my fair warned I would
tell you where she got it but I don't
remember and I also wouldn't recommend
it because she said it had the worst
customer service ever and the shipping
took like a million years also I am
drinking matcha powder that's like my
new thing Jesse got me into drinking
this and it's like all I want to drink
that it gives me so much energy way more
than coffee I am very very PG on my
channel you guys know like I don't curse
I don't like to curse on my channel I
like to you know I don't like to do that
I just don't but I will say I'm gonna
have to say the f-word a couple times in
this video because Porter not now I am
warning you so no comment about it cuz I
give a warning also this story is very
unlike me this this whole like what I'm
about to tell you is very unlike me we
did go to the club everybody got drunk
like it's something that happens alcohol
is bad for you and I know that I know
that alcohol is terribly bad for you but
I went to Vegas okay
leaving looks like it's honestly though
this story really isn't about me it's
about Amelia it's mainly surrounding
Amelia I wanted to film this video
earlier I've been getting tweets every
day where's the Vegas Kat chats but
there was just always something in the
way the first time I tried to film this
video I was in like a crazy thunderstorm
at my power went out I could have felt
the second time I had $0.50 candy shop
song like in my head all day that I
couldn't even concentrate
I got Amelia's permission to tell this
story so let's go so I was recently in
Las Vegas and there was a ton of beauty
bloggers everywhere that were in Vegas
the same time I was I was technically
there for a benefit reveal like benefit
revealed their new bra products at it
yeah they flew out a bunch of bloggers
but we were actually already going for
Danny's birthday it was just lucky I
left on a Tuesday and I returned on a
Tuesday so I was there seven days it was
me Danny and his friend Danilo we flew
to Vegas and then Jesse which if you
don't know Jesse you should know Jesse I
will link her channel down below Jesse
smiles you know her she drove up with
her friend
Rachel and they medicine Vegas on
Tuesday night which Rachel also has a
channel I will link her down below I
will link everybody who I talked about
in this video who has a channel down
below the only other person is my sister
but I'll link them all below so Tuesday
night it was me Danny Danilo Jesse and
Rachel and then the rest of our group
wasn't coming in until Thursday night
which was the needles lady friend Gina
amelia mondo melissa my sister and her
husband so at one point there was 11 of
us on this Vegas trip
I don't do clubs I don't really like
clubbing I've never been to one before
this but clubs in Miami I just you just
hear the worst things Dan I didn't want
to go to the club either but we were
surprisingly convinced and we decided to
go to the marquee on Friday night the
marquee is a club at the Cosmopolitan by
the way I was staying at the
Cosmopolitan Hotel and being the
scaredy-cat that I am I said if I was
gonna go to a club it was gonna be the
one at my hotel which turned out to be
the marquee so we got VIP for the
marquee because you know I don't like
crowds
so I wanted to you know make sure I was
like in my own little area so on Friday
night before we went to marquee we went
to this place called Beauty &amp;amp; Essex it's
like a restaurant slash bar we decided
to do that first because all the benefit
people were there we wanted to hang out
with like the benefit people they let me
bring all my friends all 11 of us and we
all started to hang out at that
restaurant but none of us realized that
the last time we had eaten was like
breakfast time none of us really had
food so when we show up to this Beauty &amp;amp;
Essex place all they're giving it's like
little appetizers that they're like
walking around with and we're like
trying to make the best out of the
situation we're just like eating all of
them because we were so hungry
and we knew that we were gonna go to a
club and then you know drink so we
wanted to make sure we were eating and
by the way prior to this whole little
thing I had like seven mimosas like at
10 o'clock in the morning not like
back-to-back it lasted throughout the
day but then I had a pineapple mint
margarita after that it was Vegas I was
they drinking so we were at this beauty
in Essex place and everybody was
drinking and having a good time
well I guess Emilia didn't really notice
that she wasn't eating but I wasn't
paying attention we leave when we go to
marki and we do like the whole VIP thing
and it's all 11 of us in this little
corner and I've never been to a club
before but they put like a little cool
rope and you're like buy a couch and
then this girl walks over with like a
giant bottle of Belvedere when I tell
you that is the
biggest alcohol bottle I've ever seen
I'm not kidding it was like this big of
this big doesn't even fit my screen it
was like this game of Belvidere which is
vodka and then they came over with like
another regular-sized Belvedere and they
put it in the little ice thing and they
throw in some champagne they put a whole
big-ass bottle of champagne and I was
like okay that's fine it's 11 of us that
seems like a lot of alcohol Bowater I
snapped a lot of the club experience I
downloaded my snapchat to go over again
in this video with you guys I'm not
gonna go over the entire snapchat
because I think altogether it's like 10
minutes but there are key points I want
to highlight so I was not feeling the
music as soon as we get there I don't
really love house music is that what
it's called it's just not my thing I
know that people love house music that's
why they play it but it's just not
something I personally loved so I was
like not really feeling it in the
beginning actually let me let me let me
scoot over here because I'm gonna play
some of my snapchat stories here and I'm
not the best editor so I really don't
like split the screen so I'm just gonna
move over so I don't have to really edit
that much I mean I had a drink in my
hand so it was all good and I was
surrounded by friends which is really
the only thing I cared about but the
music well my favorite if anybody was
wondering I was drinking Belvedere with
orange juice I think that's called a
screwdriver now you guys don't really
know my friends but Melissa does not
drink Melissa never drink by the way
Melissa is the voice you guys heard in
the no mirror makeup challenge she was
like sitting there when I was talking to
Melissa
that's Melissa now you guys know what
she looks like she does not drink so she
was just taken down the drinks having
the time of her life mondo is her
boyfriend mondo and Danny have been best
friends for like 25 years now things
gonna start to get really crazy until
the end of the night and then I don't
know what time my sister decided like oh
yeah I'm over this and she got up and
her and Robert left she wasn't really
drinking and she was really tired she
had just flown in that morning so she
was just like not up for it she danced a
little but she was like yeah I'm done
I'm done with this up and then the next
one to leave was Rachel but Rachel had
like a million drinks that day she was
like the biggest trooper ever she had
like so many drinks and she's a tiny
tiny little human and she did not
stumble or fall over or nothing not once
I think it was around like 1:00 in the
morning when Rachel I was like you know
what I'm gonna go up to the room um I'm
pretty drunk and she just walked up to
the room like an adult
and went to sleep can't say the same for
the rest of us so at this point it was
eight of us actually from now on I will
refer to mondo as champagne papi because
that is the name he was calling himself
the entire night so after a while the
drinks really started to affect us and
we were just having the time of our
lives all of a sudden the music that we
didn't think we liked we were loving we
were singing all those songs I got to a
point where literally every single
person I was there was pretty wasted I
mean I was pretty drunk I didn't really
notice but I mean I just kept drinking
drinking drinking there was no stopping
the woman and I don't know whose bright
idea it was but somebody decided that we
all needed some patron shots somebody
ordered patron shots
we all had patron shots but I did a
little sneaky thing where I took half
and then threw away the rest don't know
who I hit when they threw it back
probably somebody but I got like half
the shot so I wasn't as wasted as
everyone else now I kind of worried
about putting this part in the video
like talking about this part but it's
just so funny to me that I'm gonna tell
you anyway and I'm hoping you guys
aren't judgmental so I'm hoping you guys
will just accept it but I mean it
doesn't really smoke cigarettes like
every day but when she drinks she likes
to have the occasional cigarette ah Who
am I to judge not my thing but it's
horrific
what and I have no idea you could even
smoke in a club when I saw the first
person like the sugar and I'm like oh my
god you could smoke in here what is this
place so a little bit towards the end of
the night everybody's drunk every is
having a good time and I noticed that
Amelia she just keeps taking shots and
she's taking shots with Gina who we had
just met turned out Gina's awesome she
was super cool though she was just
taking shots with Gina I'm just dancing
they're sipping on my drink and I'm like
that's not gonna end well but I just
keep sipping on my drink I knew that
things got really bad when I turned and
looked at Amelia and she was smoking a
cigarette backwards completely backwards
she's like literally like though like
yellowy part was on the outside like she
was smoking her cigarette records and
I'm pretty sure she was there like
smoking it for like a good minute didn't
even realize it it was backwards so for
whatever reason drunk Cathleen thought
that was the funniest thing she had ever
seen like I really felt that that was
the funniest thing I had seen in months
I started to crack up all alone I took
the cigarette out of her mouth and I
started to show it to everyone I'm like
oh my god everybody doesn't care they're
like drunk having a good time and I'm
like shoving a cigarette in their face
I'm like look at this
amelia was smoking this backwards I
thought it was so funny and for the rest
of the night my mission was
protect that cigarette bring it home
with me and keep it for the rest of my
life as a souvenir because I thought it
was that funny so surprisingly enough I
was actually really hard to take care of
that cigarette one time it fell
underneath the table where all the
alcohol was at the craw and like put my
hand under the table another time it
fell into like a puddle of vodka which
was probably half of my patron shot if
I'm gonna be honest
went like this to dry it off and I kept
it and I put it in this that's right
this is not the benefit give me bro this
is the box I kept it in she was smoking
this for a good minute before I stopped
her and I'm pretty sure that if I
wouldn't have stopped her she would have
smoked the whole thing like this I'm
just gonna put this back in this box and
keep it for the rest of my life and show
Amelia's children what she did anyway it
got to a point where Amelia was just
like super sloppy kind of like falling
over and melissa is like sitting her
down telling her to relax just calm down
just stay seated just be calm and when
melissa is drunk she's like very how do
I put this animated like just be calm
sit there be calm and then Melissa
whispers to me which I don't think she
said but Melissa whispers to me she's
like oh my gosh she has to throw up
chance to throw up so I'm drunk I grab
the champagne bottle take it out of the
ice bucket take the Belvedere out of the
ice bucket I dump out the ice bucket
like that like a crazy woman Brad dump
out the ice bucket and hand the bucket
to Amelia and when I do that Melissa's
like are you crazy she's not gonna throw
up in a VIP this is VIP what are you
doing so Melissa gets up but she's like
I'm gonna take her to the bathroom
because she's just she's about to throw
up I gotta take her to the bathroom I'm
like all right be careful and then I
continue to dance me and Jesse having
time of our lives pardon it up Danny was
fist bumping we were off fist bumping at
one point boss all of a sudden I don't
know how long after they left but all of
a sudden Melissa just starts charging to
the VIP like this running like that and
she runs up to me and she's like they
took her they took her and she's like
freaking out I'm like they took who they
took who actually it was more like they
took who she's like Amelia the security
guard just took Amelia and left and I
don't know where the hell she went so
immediately I'm like what I turn around
I tell Jessie I'm like they took Amelia
the security guard took Amelia
Jesse sobered up in like 5.2 seconds
she's like well then let's get out of
here we gotta go get Amelia we turned
around we each grab our purses cuz it
was like in this chest thing which thank
God for Gina because she grabbed
Amelia's first because everybody was so
drunk they really just grabbed their own
purse so we get her perfect tell Danny
I'm like they took him medially
everybody everybody we don't know where
media's let's go we leave the VIP this
at this point I think it's like 3:00 in
the morning and according to Melissa
when she told me the story they walked
into the bathroom and if I'm gonna be
honest amelia was like stumbling all
over the place
the security guard probably saw her
stumble into the bathroom like a crazy
person and thought she was like on some
sort of drugs that they took her so
according to Melissa they walked into
the bathroom there with Gina Gina
completely skipped the line from people
in the bathroom that's never a good
thing
and then Amelia goes into her stall and
Melissa's like waiting outside and in
the security guard comes up to me
listens like where is she and as soon as
Amelia walks out the thing they just
grab her and take her so we ran outside
of the marquee and we see like this
bouncer guy there and Jesse's like hey
we had a friend here and they took her
the security guard took her I guess
because she was too drunk and we don't
know where she is and this bouncer was
like yeah I think they took her to the
bridge mind you the bridge is like not
that far but we had to walk a little bit
so they all start running to the bridge
we go outside this is like outside of
the hotel we get to the bridge and we're
like and I don't see a media I start
freaking out I'm like oh my god I'm in
the hangover oh my god Stephanie this is
happening and Jesse's like oh my god
they didn't bring her to the bridge like
I was crazy so we run back and Danny
starts talking to the guy and he's like
listen they just took my sister I need
to know where my sister is
which if you are confused by the way
that's actually how I met Danny Emilia
is my best friend from like sixth grade
and Danny was her stepbrother at a point
in life Amelia's dad and Danny's mom
were no longer together but they were at
one point making them stepbrother and
stepsister and that's how I met Danny so
he's like my sister I need to find her
and then they're like okay yeah but just
you you know follow me
Danny follows like some guy to like the
back of the club and then the rest of us
are just like wandering around the hotel
like all freaking out danila and Jeana
we're like passed out in front of this
Mexican restaurant that was right next
to the marquee totally out pass out on
the couch and Melissa's just like then
you're gonna be like calm down calm down
it's gonna be fine calm down
finally Danny calls us and he's like
yeah they're taking her to the hospital
I was like
hmm say that again he's like yep I'm on
an uber right now following her on the
ambulance on the way to a hospital so he
just told us to go back to the hotel
room and then he would call and we'd
figure it out Monza was like freaking
out and he's like oh my god oh my god
poor Danny poor genic it didn't even
that mean he was in the house when he's
like poor Danny he was having such a
good time he was fist bumping and now
he's on his way to hospital so all of us
go right upstairs to the hotel room our
room was set up like okay so we had a
living room and I had a living room in a
kitchen and then I had like two master
bedrooms connected to it so momma
Melissa were staying in one master
bedroom and it means Danny were singing
the other one and then everybody else
just kind of like slept in the living
room melissa runs into the bathroom to
like throw up I guess and just gets like
butt naked like butt naked I walk into
the room not knowing she's like butt
naked I woke up to her I'm so drunk that
I don't even care that I see her entire
ass I'm like hey Melissa you want to
come hang out with us on the balcony
we're just all hanging out on the
balcony and she just looks at me she's
like I'm so up and I'm like oh so
like are you not gonna go to the back of
your whip and she just kept repeating
like I am so up so I was like you
know what maybe it's just best you just
go to sleep and then Gina gets up and
she's like I have to throw up I have to
throw up and she goes to walk into the
bathroom and Melissa is like I'm naked
and Gina's like I don't care Melissa
walks right out of the bathroom naked in
front of Gina which we didn't know 48
hours prior to this trip she was bad
drunk she ended up just passing out
going asleep I ended up just passing out
going to sleep and then the next morning
when I wake up Danny's next to me and
I'm like oh my god Melia I was like
freaking out and I'm like where's Amelia
he's like well they had to keep her
overnight because they don't know her
alcohol level so they have to keep her
check her alcohol level and then we'll
see 3:00 p.m. she did not come out of
the hospital till 3:00 p.m. I don't even
want to tell you guys where her alcohol
level was I don't want amelia was
wearing a black liquid lipstick the
night before and I promise you the next
day when she walked into the hotel she
looked like she had been chewing on some
charcoal for like three hours it was
like and we were like whoa what's up
girl how'd it go I promise you I thought
that amelia had just like walked in from
like the most traumatic experience ever
she
like dude she said that she woke up in
the hospital and there was a girl next
to her which I don't even know how she
was that close to her but there was a
girl next to her which I think she had
to be on something a little bit more
powerful than alcohol because Amelia
says she was just like rambling and
saying like crazy things at one point
she was like reaching over to Amelia and
she was like don't die don't die freaked
her out she kept asking security like
can we do something about this girl
who's touching me it was insane but
that's not where this story ends I'm
telling you if there's one thing I
learned about Vegas is that everything
does happen for a reason when Amelia got
to Vegas she got there Thursday night
she had brought her passport which if
you travel in the United States you
don't need your passport to travel you
just need your passport to travel
outside of the United States so when she
got there I was like God why did you
bring your passport she's like I don't
know just in case well guess what she
gets back to the hotel and I mean I we
had all her stuff like we had her phone
her wallet her ID we had everything and
then Danny took it to the hospital when
he went to go pick her up she gave him
her ID she exchanged at the hospital
whatever they discharged her blah blah
blah when she gets back to the hotel and
we're getting ready to like go to the
Hoover Dam she notices that her ID is
missing she goes back upstairs
she looks everywhere for her ID and it
is nowhere to be found
she calls the hospital the hospital
tells her all don't worry come right in
we have your ID oh thank gosh right yeah
she gets to the hospital and
miraculously they lost her ID they had
spoken to her on the phone like 20
minutes before she got there and they
lost her ID it was nowhere wasn't in the
lost-and-found it was they had asked the
nurse who called her and told her that
they had it that person didn't know
where it was thank God that she brought
her passport because that is the only
way she got back to Miami she needed her
ID for like so many things on the rest
of the trip and she was showing her
passport like everywhere she went and I
was just like man the only person who
brought their passport on the trip as a
person who lost her ID isn't insane
finally ordered it when she got to Miami
fit the books she had to pay 50 bucks to
renew her ID because hers was about to
expire anyway but yeah 50 bucks that's
what a wild night costs you actually no
it cost you a lot more than that because
you guys don't even want to know what
her medical bill was so yeah that's
pretty much what happened and meetly got
really wasted she even got so wasted
that she burned me
you can't tell you could barely see it
now because it happened like over a week
ago but it was like a huge burn mark
I wouldn't say huge because a cigarette
hole is like literally this big but it
was the same exact perfect size of a
cigarette from the out of me I
caught a little glimpse of it so yeah
that was my first clubbing experience
there was even a point Rose chugging
champagne out of the bottle I looked
crazy guys I was like Viva Las Vegas
chugging champagne out of the bottle
there wasn't much comedy to my story but
I really was just telling you the story
of how I mainly ended up in the hospital
in Las Vegas
moral of the story is don't drink if you
haven't eaten and if you are drinking if
you haven't eaten don't take 12 shots of
Belvedere but yeah I had a great time
thank you to everyone I know I already
said this in the previous video but
thank you to everyone who said such
positive comments and my Instagram I'm
how proud of me you were for just like
doing things I don't normally do like
getting on an airplane and help my fear
of flying and I was even on a helicopter

I feel like I was able to achieve those
goals because of you guys being so
positive and so uplifting you guys gave
me the courage to even book that trip so
