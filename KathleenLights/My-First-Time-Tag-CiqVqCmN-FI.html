today I had to do a bunch of things in
the morning and then I realized that
tomorrow is Friday and I'm supposed to
post a video tomorrow and I was like oh
my god I had completely forgotten that
it was Thursday and I actually wanted to
film a tutorial for tomorrow's video but
I completely forgot so I'll be posting
that video on Monday so I decided to
just do a tag video because I feel like
I haven't done a tag video and a pretty
long time and the tag I'm doing today is
called the my first time tag and if you
haven't seen this tag before which I'm
sure you have because it's like going
all over YouTube right now it is just a
tie we just talked about your firsts and
nothing inappropriate because my first
time sounds extremely inappropriate the
first time I read the title of this tag
I was like what but it's not an
inappropriate tag and by the way if
you're someone who doesn't like tag
videos if you just like watching beauty
videos that's fine just don't watch the
video but sometimes I like to add
personal things on this channel I just
think why not okay so I have all the
First's pulled up right here and I'm not
going to go in any specific order I'm
just going to read them and answer them
first crush my first crush is actually
when I was in preschool I'm pretty sure
with preschool yeah I was like madly in
love with this little kid named Ralphie
he was like this little chubby kid with
like black hair he had a mushroom
haircut he was like the cutest thing
ever
his name was his name was actually
Raphael justice I still remember his
full name psycho he was actually a great
above me he was in my cousin's class and
then we would all like hang out at the
playground at the same time and I just
remember thinking he was like the cutest
little boy in the world there's actually
a video of me at Denny's my mom recorded
this for some weird reason I don't know
but there's a video of me at Denny's and
he's like a couple of booths down from
me and mine Joe is very very young and I
was like turning bright red in the video
because he was at Denny's at the same
time that I was and I kept looking over
the like cushion and like freaking out
because Ralphie was in the same danice's
me but yeah I never saw him again after
preschool or whatever but yeah he was my
first crush number two first kiss my
first kiss was from my first boyfriend
if you can even consider that a
boyfriend at 13 I don't know like a fake
little boyfriend I was 13 years old and
it happened at my best friend's house
and his name was George and I actually
really glad that George was my first
kiss because we became really really
good friends after that and I know so
many people like regret their first kiss
or oh my god it was so awkward and weird
but I mean it was awkward and weird it's
it's always awkward and weird he was
like one of my best friends all through
middle school in high school we would
talk on the phone all the time so I'm
really glad that my first kiss was my
friend you know
well at the time he was like my
boyfriend or whatever but he was a
friend of mine so it wasn't like a
regret or a weird first kiss so that's
good
number three first boyfriend my first
boyfriend was George but it was like a
dumb little relationship I mean it
didn't last very long you know we were
clearly better off as friends but my
first actual boyfriend like what I
considered a serious second a real
boyfriend was my freshman year of high
school
his name was William and he was really
really cool he was actually a really
really good guy so good to the point
that I thought I mean I was young I
thought all guys were like that and then
when he and I broke up and I saw the
kind of male species high school has I
was like oh number four first best
friend my first best friend from what I
remember is a girl named Kim she I met
her in fourth grade I didn't really have
a best friend before that because my
best friend was my cousin Jeanine and I
didn't feel
I needed any other friends but I met her
in fourth grade and we actually sat next
to each other and one day for some weird
reason we decided to write down our
addresses don't know why but when we
looked at each other's address we were
like our addresses look crazy similar
everywhere in fourth grade so we didn't
put two and two together but we figured
we lived pretty close to each other and
then one day she called my house and she
was like okay do me a favor and stand
outside and she was like on her bike and
she was like riding bike down the street
while talking to me on the phone and
then she like rode bike right in front
of my house five seconds later and we
were like oh my god she lived literally
five houses down from me so we would
like top on the phone and stand in the
front yard just like watch each other
from our front yard really weird but
yeah she was my first best friend she
would go on trips with us she was
literally at my house every single day
first embarrassing moment I actually
have two really embarrassing moments
because I don't know which one went
first
they were both in middle school which
was the darkest time of my life
middle school was just one embarrassing
moment to be completely honest but I'll
just give you two of them okay so the
first one my sister loves to laugh about
even till this day okay so I'm pretty
sure I was in seventh grade and it was
raining really really hard after school
so I was waiting in the front of the
school for my mom and when I seen my dad
is picking me up it wasn't my mom and he
pulls up in this raggedy old truck that
he loved so much but it was it was just
really old and every time like he would
turn the steering wheel i was like 'i
like it made that noise it was it was it
was it was that but yeah i see him pull
up and i'm like oh god that truck and
then i see him get out of the car
with this giant what seems to be
something that you would cover your car
with or like up your tools with in a
shed a giant plastic bag but it wasn't a
bag it was just like a sheet but it was
huge okay it was this giant plastic cape
basically
and he comes walking towards me like
holding on to the cape you know over his
head and walking towards me and I'm
sitting some standing there like no no
no like freaking out because he looks
like a crazy person with this giant
plastic thing and he's like come on come
on and I'm like standing under the roof
I'm like nope mmm trying to pretend like
I don't see him I'm like no and he start
any starts getting mad he's like let's
go it's raining and I had to walk and
walk to the car under this giant plastic
bag because of course why wouldn't he
have an umbrella there was a lot of
laughing and pointing
I remember my stagnant really
embarrassing moment is more sad than
embarrassing but it really really
embarrassed me I was walking with my
friend Emmeline to the car to my mom's
car after school and I thought this kid
was like super cute like I had a huge
crush on him and he was standing behind
me with his friend and then all of a
sudden I hear them laughing like
cracking up and then they like walk
around us and then they just keep
walking like they ran away like if they
did something and then just ran and then
I was like why were they laughing and
then my friend leans like you have a
huge piece of gum in your hair and then
I touch my head and it's like this giant
gum just stuck to the back of my head
and then I freaked out like clearly they
put gum in my hair so I run to my mom's
car and I'm like freaking out long story
short when I got home she had to take
the gum out of my hair with degreaser
like what you clean the kitchen with to
break down the gum because nothing was
getting it out and I was just like where
are people so mean I was like freaking
out in the kitchen and yeah that was
really embarrassing and really mean
people are so mean first plane ride my
first plane ride was I
in 2010 I had never ridden a plane
before that and it was when I was going
to the Bahamas funny story though
something happened where we missed our
flight and then when the plane was
pulling up like the plane that we were
going to take to go to the Bahamas
it was this tiny plane with propellers
like it had propellers and I was like I
freaked out I was like okay the first
time I'm getting on a plane and it's
this kind of plane I literally prayed
and cried the entire way to the Bahamas
which going from Miami to the Bahamas is
like 30 minutes but still it was just
traumatizing yeah that was my first
plane ride I clearly don't like to fly
first fear actually didn't remember what
my first fear was because to be honest
my life is one big fear I'm afraid of
everything and I've been that way since
I was younger so I really don't know
what my first fear was but I text my
sister and I asked her and she was like
the dark which is so true I was so
terrified of the dark I remember that we
would we shared a room and like she
would turn the TV off to go to sleep and
I'd be like no I would like freak out
and make her turn the TV bag on and they
would piss her off so bad but yeah was
terrified of the dark I'm not anymore I
have to sleep in like total darkness now
but yeah was really scared of the dark
first pet I've had pets on my life so I
don't remember what my first pet was but
from my memory I'm pretty sure it was
this like old Labrador we had in the
backyard and his name was wolf and he
was like full of fleas and like old but
I really loved him me and my brother
really loved him I remember my brother
Johnny really loved him my first pet
that I owned that's actually mine like
that's mine is Cornelius my Yorkie but
I've always had pets like as a family
always I've always had dogs first
alcoholic drink I remember this story
vividly so my best friend and I went to
a party with one of my friends Robert
and don't remember how old I was I think
I might
been 15 which is so young I know but I
was 15 and my friend was like here taste
this you'll like this and I was like
what is this and they were like I
remember was Malibu coconut no Malibu
something I don't know
rum or something I don't know maybe
Malibu is wrong I don't know but I know
the bottle said Malibu and I remember
tasting it and thinking it was the
nastiest thing that I had ever tasted
but I remember Robert was like oh my god
just drink it there's barely anything in
your cup just drink it talk about peer
pressure but yeah I was like yeah yeah
drink it I'll drink it and I remember
drinking the cup and I felt like crap
like like literally I felt so bad and
then my mom picked this up and I like
walked to the car and I was sitting in
the front seat like and I was like
what's wrong with you I was like nothing
nothing's wrong with me may I remember
that night vividly it was so gross and
I've never really been a drinker I'm 21
years old and I just I really I don't
drink first tattoo my first tattoo was
when I was 16 years old and now thinking
about it that's crazy young for a first
tattoo I don't know what my dad was
thinking letting me get intensive at 16
but he did and I got a tiny little star
on my foot because my sister had the
exact same tattoo and I wanted the
tattoo my sister had so I got a star on
my foot first piercing I guess my first
piercings would be my ears um but if
you're talking like piercings that are
not ears I got my bellybutton pierced
when I was 16 I went I was going through
something when I was 16 apparently but
yeah I got my bellybutton pierced and I
still have it and no one ever knows
because I do not show my stomach ever
like I don't wear crop tops or anything
like that I just never show my stomach
so when I tell people I have my belly
button pierced early what first person
you subscribed to on YouTube
it was either makeup by Tiffany D or
mischievous I think I'm saying her name
right
Judis mischievous I don't know it was I
think it was mischievous actually
because I remember thinking that her
makeup tutorials were so incredible and
that's all I would watch when I was um
when I first started watching YouTube
videos like she is all I would watch
first concert um my first concert was my
senior year of high school and it was my
only concert I've never gone to another
concert and I went to John Mayer's
battle studies concert when he was down
in Miami and it was probably the best
night of my life I am a huge John Mayer
fan and I'm not a concert kind of girl
and I always said that the only concert
I would ever go to is a John Mayer
concert just because people make me
nervous and concerts have a lot of
people so that just makes me nervous but
I loved the battle studies concert his
battle studies album with my favorite
album so it was just a really good night
I loved that concert so much and last
question first phone my first phone was
when I was in sixth grade and it was
this tiny blue Nokia that was like in
black and white and then would light up
orange I don't know if you guys know
what I'm talking about it's old school
but it was my favorite phone I loved it
so much it was like the cutest little
thing I mean it was oh but I loved it it
