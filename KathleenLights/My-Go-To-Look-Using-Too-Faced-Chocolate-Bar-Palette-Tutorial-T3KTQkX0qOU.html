tutorial on the look I am wearing right
now it is using the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette the original chocolate bar
palette okay my favorite palette of all
time it has been so so highly requested
to do a tutorial using this palette
since you guys know it's my favorite
yeah I don't have like any tutorials
using it I think I only have like one or
two this is my go-to look with this
palette if I'm gonna go out at night
time or if I'm just gonna go out like
special events or something like that
this is the look I always do and you
wanting something funny I started doing
this tutorial and I did my eyes first
and then I did my face and then I always
like finish up my eyes before I contour
and put my blush well a lot whatever
anyway I completely forgot to do my
lower lash line and I did my entire face
I put on my lipstick I was even ready to
say goodbye and I realized oh my gosh I
didn't even finish up my eyes so in this
video you will see me do like my entire
face put on my lip and everything and
then I finish up my eyes so not to
confuse anybody what I totally blanked
so yeah I really hope you like this look
let me know if you guys want to see
another tutorial using this palette and
if you want to see how to get this one
then just keep watching okay so I'm
going to prime my eyes with the Kat Von
D primer I really like it because it
covers the veins on my eyes but it's a
little bit too dark for me but you could
definitely see it on my lids anyway so
I'm going into the chocolate bar palette
and I'm going to take white chocolate
and I'm going to set that primer down so
that it's not sticky and this is a
Sephora pro brush and then I'm taking
salted caramel which is probably my
favorite shadow in this palette and I'm
taking it on my morphe 23 brush and I'm
just putting this into my crease but I'm
putting a lot of it like I really want
this crease color to stand out so I'm
applying a lot now I'm going into
semi-sweet which is another Brown but a
little bit cooler it's not as warm as
salted caramel and I'm applying this on
the outer portion of my eye and then
slowly dragging it into my crease I'm
using a Sophie 320 brush but it's just
like a Mac 217 you know that kind of
shape so yes as you can see I'm just
dragging it little by little into my
crease
now I'm taking triple fudge and I'm
going to do the exact same thing with
the same brush only I'm applying a
little bit more to the outer outer
corners because I really want the outer
V of the eye to be like saturated with
the brown shadow so I'm just packing
that onto the outer corners and then
dragging it all the way in on my crease
I'm going back and forth it takes a
little bit of time because you really
want it to look gradient and not too
messy so you don't want to apply too
much too fast so just apply the color a
little by little and build up slowly
that's how you'll get the best
application I took the color Semite nope
no salted caramel and I just applied
more into my crease and now I'm um
highlighting underneath my brow bone
with white chocolate now I'm going into
marzipan this is like my other favorite
shadow in the palette I love it and I'm
taking that like on a flat shader brush
and I'm applying this wherever I didn't
put any of the brown shadows then I just
applied some fix+
and dipped it back into the shadow just
to intensify it a little bit more but
I'm just applying this on the inner
parts of my eyes then I'm going back
into triple fudge and blending those two
colors together because I don't want
like a harsh line between the triple
fudge and the marzipan you know just
making sure everything is an S and
bloody going right back into semi-sweet
I'm kind of sandwich in the two colors
salted caramel and triple fudge making
sure it's a nice gradient effect and
then I'm taking creme brulee and
applying that right on top of marzipan
not too much but I just wanted a little
bit of gold to shine through and then
I'm going to apply some eyeliner this is
the Maybelline Lines the little I forgot
how much I love this it's so easy to use
this I love it
so I'm just applying you know like a
thin little wing or like a thin little
line on top and I'm gonna do it like a
wing but I'm not gonna do it just yet
I'll show you in a little while I'm
going to tightline with this Maybelline
master skinny eyeliner I forgot to show
this in my drugstore review I really
like it so I'm just tightlining with
this and I'm taking this blink
ultra-thin liner look at how tiny this
is this is like the skinniest little
brush tip I've ever seen in my life so
it's so easy to get a really sharp wing
with this it's amazing it's from the
brand blink and it's awesome for a wing
amazing anyway so I'm going in with
mascara and then I'm popping on some
violet false lashes in I do for my face
I am just applying my Too Faced hangover
primer and I'm applying it to my whole
face and then I'm taking my aqua
foundation from cozened oh and I'm
applying this with a wet and wild kabuki
like flat top kabuki brush love this
brush I really like this foundation it's
not my favorite of all time but I really
do like it it leaves a nice dewy finish
it's just very expensive so I rarely use
it on camera now I'm going to conceal my
under eyes and this is the collection
lasting finish concealer I believe what
that's what it's called I got on Amazon
because I cannot get that product in the
States but I have to say I really really
love it and then I mix it in with my wet
and wild illuminating concealer pen
thingy and I'm also highlighting my face
with this as well I love this it's from
when in wild it's like three dollars and
it's awesome and then I'm just buffing
and blending all of that in this is a
brush from BH Cosmetics it's just like
their pointed foundation brush
to set that I'm going to use my our CMA
and Ocala founder of course you already
know and I'm setting that with my morphe
49 brush and I'm also setting the places
I put concealer I'm not setting my whole
face because I want it to remain a
little bit more dewy and this is the
bronzer I've been using a lot recently
it's from Shoei and it's called suntan
and I just find it looks so natural on
the skin I really love this bronzer I'm
applying it with my morphe mb5 brush
it's just like a chunky stippling brush
awesome brush as well and this is a new
product just recently picked it up this
is from the Sephora brand and it is
their contouring bronzer in the shade
Los Cabos I really like it the first
time I used it in it's not bad and it's
actually less expensive than a lot of
bronzers at Sephora I'm contouring my
face with the Sigma F 23 brush and yeah
I really like that bronzer it's not bad
okay so now I'm going to highlight this
is the natasha's did ona highlight in
the shade 0-1 light I'm highlighting
with a fan brush this is the morphe m3
1-0 and it's a really great brush so I'm
a little sad because my blush broke this
is a Milani blush in the shade Awakening
rose I got mine on Amazon because I
couldn't really find it anywhere in
store it was limited edition but I'm
pretty sure Amazon still has it it's a
beautiful blush and for my lips I'm
lining them with Mac etc lip pencil I'm
filling in my entire lips with the etc
prolong wear lip pencil and then I'm
going over it with my favorite gloss
this is buxom White Russian and yes I
love this little lip combination and you
could totally leave your eyes like this
I think it looks so pretty without a
lower lash line like without a smokey
lower lash line but if you're like me
and you like a lower smokey lash line
then the rest of this video is for you
so I'm just applying that same
Maybelline skinny black liner gel thingy
to my waterline I don't love it as much
as my NYX one but it is still really
really good
and then after that I took triple fudge
on a zoeva 238 brush to really get
really close to my waterline and smoke
it out a little bit and then on a
regular pencil brush this is from Sigma
I am just buffing out the salted caramel
shade so that it matches with my top lid
and then I just highlighted my inner
corners with champagne truffle and
applied some mascara and then that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
