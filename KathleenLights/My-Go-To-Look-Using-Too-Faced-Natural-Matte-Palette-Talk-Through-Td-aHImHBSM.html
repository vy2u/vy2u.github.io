a talk through tutorial kind of I
decided to do one because I haven't done
one in a while I haven't actually done a
tutorial in a while because you guys
know I've been painting and I've
actually had to film videos that were
super easy to film like just reviews or
talking kind of videos um let's talk
about something really quick so I got
new lights and actually like my lighting
is completely off in this video I don't
know if you guys could even tell it
looks bad and viewfinder it probably
looks bad to you guys highlighting is
completely off because I had told you
guys in a previous video that I had a
ring light and then I broke it so I
thought that the only thing that broke
was the bulb because the bulb shattered
into like a million pieces so I
purchased a new bulb so when I went to
go put the bulb inside the ring light
and it was there and it was perfect I'm
like ah beautiful and I went to plug it
in and it didn't work so it wasn't the
bulb something was come is completely
wrong with my ring light actually called
the people I told in situation and I was
still under warranty so I have to send
it out tomorrow they have to they have
to get it they have to see what's wrong
with it and if there's something wrong
that they can't fix they will send me a
new one so that's probably gonna take
like two weeks that's really like a two
week process to be honest so I'll
probably be filming my videos at
nighttime because it's nighttime right
now which is why I'm filming those
probably be filming my videos facing the
mirror like I always do until I get my
ring light in the mail because like the
lighting is really bad right now but
anyway today's video is going to be a
tutorial I'll talk through and I think
I'm just going to do like a combination
of looks I've been wearing in my
previous videos I'm gonna do the eye
look I'm going to use my Too Faced
natural matte palette this is what it
looks like I love it it's kind of like
the look I was wearing in the review
only without the blue I'm not going to
add the
I'm just gonna use this palette and this
palette alone today I actually going to
start out with my face I never start out
with my face but why not I'm actually
gonna pick up my hair by the way there's
still an echo in this room like a
hardcore echo and I don't know what else
to do I open the window I put a rug I
put my furniture in here my beauty
blenders on the other side of the room
anyway so I don't exactly know what to
do I'm still gonna get more furniture I
have to put in like another furniture
unit in this room it's because I have
hardwood floors
can you hear outside I opened up a
window to see if that would help
but I don't know if I should get a
bigger rug like a more fluffier rug or
just put like a bunch more things on the
wall I don't know I have a mic so I
bought a mic for the echo in my last
room and it seemed to work but for some
reason in this room it's just okay so
I'm going to find my face using my
favorite primer in the entire world this
is the hangover or X or hangover X
replenishing face primer I love this
because it has coconut water
electrolytes probiotics and I really
like it because it hydrates my face most
importantly so it's kind of like a
primer and a moisturizer all in one and
I really really love it oh dear I'd like
my band-aid I was actually setting up
the lights a little while ago and I
clamped my arm and I was like bleeding
and it was traumatic
I'm gonna add some radiance to my face
because the foundation I'm using I kind
of really have to be doing for it to
look good but I still run love it so I'm
gonna use it and I'm using the bodyshop
radiant highlighter I got this at the
body shop store in California and I
really like it's just like a champagne e
pink color it's really pretty on top of
the cheekbones but I actually really
like it underneath my makeup as well
okay so the foundation I'm using is the
brand new foundation to cover effects
like they just came out with this and
this was sent to me I actually have I
don't know Fisher if I can call Cory a
friend
hi Cory if you're watching but I have a
friend sort of who works over at coverfx
and sometimes it sends me like new
products and I love this foundation I
tried it out for the first time
yesterday and I really liked it and
usually I do not like foundations like
this because it's like a serum II kind
of Foundation kind of like the bare skin
one from bare minerals hated it the
Physicians Formula one that's in a
dropper hated it
I don't like serum II things they don't
stick well on my dry skin but this one
if I hydrate I actually love the finish
I have mine in G 30 it's their cover FX
custom cover drops I love it just comes
out like a dropper like this and I just
dropped some on the back of my hand o do
much hands too much super runny as you
can see if the shake it really good
before you apply it it says shake well
and I like to use my Beauty Blender with
it looks a little scary but it all comes
together
I really like the finish that this gives
it does be like a matte finish but it
looks kind of like flawless I don't know
how to explain it it is a little light
for me as you can see a little pale but
nothing a little bronzer Kennex okay
moving on I'm going to take my pixie
correction concentrate and brightening
paint right - nique peach it's just like
an under eye corrector I'm gonna play
that underneath my eyes here I've
actually been using an eye cream that
has really been working it's a new eye
cream and I love it and I feel like my
eyes aren't as dark as they usually are
and I've got a feeling it's an eye cream
so I'm not going to add like concealer
I'm just gonna focus on highlighting I'm
using my dream Lumi touch highlighting
concealer so I'm just going to draw it
in thats like upside down triangle thing
just to highlight my face if you hear
crickets
my windows open I'm going to use my same
beauty blender to blend it in
I assumed you guys in just a little bit
what the hell I'm going to set my under
eyes with my zoeva 114 Lux face focus
and I'm going to use my elf HD under eye
setting powder I'm trying to see how
this one compares to the laura mercier
secret brightening powder so it's called
yet because I really love that one
another thing I don't like is this these
little glitters like when you really
can't see them all that much okay so I'm
going to do my eyes I'm going to prime
them using my Mac Paint Pot as per usual
these are my eyes like 90% of the time
no matter what because I find that it
really really prolongs the wear of my
eye makeup and hides all the veins on my
lids like all the darkness on all the
creepy stuff because it is like a skin
tone color or at least a color close to
my skin tone and I just I really really
love it I cannot say enough about this
I'm going to take the Too Faced natural
matte help palette palette I'm going to
take right here this color called heaven
and on a brush like this this is just a
zoeva 325 I'm just going to pack this on
my entire lid to kind of set that cream
base we put down because if I go in with
another eyeshadow right now in my crease
it's just going to get stuck to the base
so this is just going to help put a nice
like shadow layer next I'm going to take
this fluffy blending brush this is by
NARS I've no idea what's called 42 I'm
going to take the color called nudie and
I'm just going to apply this in my
crease this is basically just going to
act as my transition shade for all the
colors I will be using so that they
could blend easier
do I look blue feel like this these
lights make me look blue I don't know
I'm going to take this color called
honey butter it's a really pretty warm
peanut butter shade and I'm going to
apply this to my entire lid this is just
going to be like an all-over lid color
for me also going to dip my fluffy black
blush brush into that color again and
add it to my crease as well okay now for
my favorite eyeshadow this palette I'm
going to take chocolate cookie and I'm
going to play this on the outer portions
of my eye and into my crease as well
this is a deli um tools brush seven
seven six
I'm going to take this small crease
brush from makeup geek
I call it pencil brush because that's
what looks like and I dip it into honey
butter and kind of do the same thing on
the lower lash line I'm going to mimic
the top then taking chocolate cookie and
putting it on the outer parts of my eye
now I want to take 6x6 presso and add
that to the lower lash line just to take
away some of the warmth so it doesn't
look like I have like a red eye and look
words just wait and then I'm going to
take it again and do that to the top
part
it's gonna give it a little bit more
deepness and dimension here just a
little bit I'm going to add some
eyeliner to my ties line and my
waterline I'm going to use the NYX gel
pencil liner in brown obviously I love
these these are amazing they're my new
favorite one to the drugstore they're so
good I really feel like I don't have to
tug at my waterline when I use this
because it just glides on that I don't
need to pull my eye I'm going to
highlight like my under corners and my
brow bone with my face highlight since
everything in here is matte and I want
like more of a shimmery thing so I'm
going to want to mascara so I'm going to
curl my lashes my Chu Maura
eyelash curler so now I'm going to prime
my eyelashes this is the Estee Lauder
little black primer eyelash primer yeah
I really love this because it does a
great job of keeping my eye lashes
curled throughout the day and they make
my lashes super black and I really I
just love I just love any mascara that I
put on top of it makes it that much
better
then I'm going with Jordana's best lash
extreme around taupe
this lighting is making me look so pale
I'm gonna cry
I just want to had to put on mascara I'm
like on the rest of my eyes this
lighting is making me look really
ghostly like it's driving me nuts
remember it's the first time I'm using
my lights bear with me I'm going to go
ahead and bronze up my face I'm going to
use the body shops bronzing powder in
light matte 0/1 looks like this is like
a honey little honeycomb
and I'm using my Dell iam tools 974 I
love this bronzer I feel like it's
quickly becoming one of my top favorites
ever because it's that happy medium it's
really light when you look at it in the
pan and it's pretty light when you apply
it to your face but you can really build
it up I mean it takes some time to build
it up but it builds up really pretty and
it's not packed to you at all and it's
that perfect undertone it's not too red
it's not too orange it's not too pink or
cool toned or muddy looking I love it
I'm going to apply my blush with the
same brush these are the new NYX HD
blushes and I really really like them
especially this one this is in the shade
soft spoken and it's such a pretty color
for spring if you're into peachy blushes
pick this one up it's really nice
but because everything is so matte on my
face I want to add like a lot more of a
glow so I'm going to use this product
this is pretty new to me I got it a
couple months ago this is the Sephora
micro smooth baked sculpting trio in
Luminizer and I never really give any of
these Sephora brand products a glance at
all but Olivia my friend that works at
Sephora was like I really like these I
use them all the time and they're really
good so I picked up this one along with
two other one because I was so impressed
by it
it's not that expensive Sephora is like
a much cheaper brand like the Sephora
collection and this gives such a pretty
glow to the cheeks but it's a subtle
glow like a very wearable everyday
natural glow I just like to swirl my
entire brush into this like swirl it up
and just dust it on my cheeks
I'm gonna highlight my brow bone with
this as well
now I'm just going to finish off with my
lips and this is a lip gloss I have been
using non-stop I wore it in like
previous videos when I was wearing a
glossy lip this is the read my lips lip
gloss from the balm in the color BAM and
I usually just apply this by itself you
know I am gonna play by itself so you
guys can see it's such a pretty pigment
of color I've been wearing it not self
okay so that completes this look I
really hope you like it it's a very
wearable everyday kind of look in my
opinion sorry the lighting completely
sucks in this video I'm still tweaking
it this was like a trial run once I get
my ring light and I think it will look a
lot better but I have to position them
differently I still have to work on it
so excuse that it might be like a you
know a couple times before I get it
right but this is the look I've been
using or I've been wearing a lot with
this palette I hope you guys get it when
it's available it's at Ulta right now
but I think it's well worth the money
and I hope you guys get it thanks so
much for watching please subscribe if
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye I look creepy for some
reason what is that
I look blue holy crap it's gonna love it
it's gonna give it a little more
can you speak I'm gonna prime my eye
lashes next what this is the Estee
Lauder a little Breck blushes blush it
god this is weird
one is right outside my window I wonder
if they think I'm getting ready to shoot
a porno</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
