funny story it's actually not funny but
I filmed a tutorial on the makeup I'm
wearing right now
and go a niche I've got an itch I filmed
it earlier today and then I totally
forgot to film an intro for it and then
I was sitting here uploading all the
clips to my computer and I was like I
didn't film an intro so as I'm doing
right now and that's why I'm sitting in
front of my mirror as opposed to in
front of the window like I am for this
entire video I've worn my eyes like this
and a lot of videos recently or at least
something like this in a lot of recent
videos the look I was wearing in my last
video which was the Ipsy bag video this
basically was what I was wearing on my
eyes this is my go-to smokey eye this
looks good on everyone unex tremely fair
people and extremely dark people on
people with brown eyes people with blue
eyes people with very nice this looks
good on everyone and in this video I am
using a bunch of different colors from a
bunch of different palettes that I have
but they are very neutral colors which
means they're very doable so if you're
watching this and you're like really
you're busting out like seven different
palettes like calm down you can easily
find dupes for all these eyeshadows in
your collection since they are so
neutral I really hope you enjoy this
tutorial it was requested I posted a
picture on Instagram today of me wearing
this makeup and people were like
tutorial so that's why I mean I was
doing a tutorial regardless but yeah so
if you want to see how to get this
makeup you know what to do
so the first thing I'm going to do is
prime my eyelids with Urban Decay's
primer potion next I'm taking the
Maybelline Color tattoo in barely
branded which is this really pretty
champagne color and I'm not going to
take this past the crease I don't want
any shimmery shimmer enus in the crease
next I'm taking my Naked palette and I'm
using this color right here called naked
excuse my nails I have not painted them
yet I've just been a disaster with my
nails but anyway I'm taking this color
naked right here and I'm taking it on a
big blending brush like this and I'm
going to put this into my crease
now taking this color right here called
shroom it's from Mack I'm going to be
putting this on my entire eyelid
now taking the color book which is just
the deeper Matt Brown in The Naked
palette any medium matte Brown will work
and I'm just going to work this in the
outer part and into my crease
I'm going to take a little bit of this
color right here called smog which is
just like a very very warm bronze and
I'm going to work that in the same place
as we put buck
and I basically all I do is just
continue to build darker colors into the
crease and the outer part of my eye just
to make it very very deep I start from
bite colors to dark just because it's
easier that way I'm going to take this
color right here called brown down it is
from Mac and I'm going to be doing the
exact same thing
and I'm going to work it directly into
the socket now I'm taking a black matte
eyeshadow this is Panther by wet and
wild and I'm adding some more depth to
the outer corner of the eye just so that
it's not all Browns and I'm just packing
it on a brush like this and slightly
blending it in
now I'm taking this color right here
from my Cielo in light palette it is
called bliss and just giving the look
kind of a softer touch here on the
crease
this is just like a dusty rose color so
if you have like anything similar like a
mommy brown that will work
and now the last thing I'm putting on my
lid is this color right here called
Naked Lunch from Mac and I'm just going
to pack this on right here it's also
going to be my inner corner highlight
for my brow bone I'm just taking a matte
beige color and helping that right here
now I'm just going to add some black
eyeliner to my waterline and my tight
line and then I'm going to do the rest
of my face before I finish underneath my
eyes the foundation I'm going to be
using today is my absolute favorite
drugstore foundation a long time and it
is the Revlon Colorstay foundation
specifically for normal to dry skin the
other formula is way too thick and cakey
I really love this formula so it's going
to be popping this on my face
I know you're thinking girl that is too
dark but it's not it's matches my neck
okay so for underneath my eyes I don't
want to go too dramatic with the light
concealer but I'm going to be using my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser and just covering my bags
a little just enough where I don't
really look sleepy just kind of like
brightening up um that under-eye just a
little I'm not bringing it down all the
way to here like I normally do just cuz
I don't know
just cuz I don't always do that
I'm going to set that under-eye
concealer with my MSF natural now I'm
just going to finish putting some
eyeshadow underneath my eyes just to
make it a little bit more smoky and for
that I'm going to be taking this brown
color right here it's called brown down
from Mac and taking that on a pencil
brush like this I'm just blending that
underneath
okay and now I'm going to add a lot of
mascara I like using a really volumizing
mascara for this kind of look just
because I don't like to add some winged
liner to this kind of look
you totally can you can just add some
winged liner and then from mascara it
would look really pretty regardless if
you do I just kind of like to leave it
like this so I'm going to coat the crap
out of my lashes with my Jordan on best
last Throwdown a best lash extreme and
then I'm going to go ahead and fill in
my eyebrows and then I will be right
back so typically if I were doing this
makeup look I would do like the whole
contour blush um
highlight like the whole shebang but
today I'm just gonna bronze my face a
little bit I'm going to be using my
little baby hoola bronzer and by the way
I have been loving this bronzer it's
really really good I could see why
everyone loves it
I'm gonna be using my Real Techniques
blush brush dip in that in and kind of
bronze my face normally where I would
contour but just not so specific
okay so for my highlight I am going to
be taking it's a new purchase of mine it
is become my absolute favorite highlight
in the entire world and it is the Josie
Maran Argan illuminizer it's the most
beautiful champagne gold highlight which
is my favorite kind of highlight I'm
just going to pump that on the back of
my hand the only thing that this squirts
out a lot more than what you need just
the only thing I hate feel like like
that's way too much but you see that do
you see the beauty I know you see
for my lips I'm going to be using a
combination of two things I'm going to
be using Mac miss lipstick which is a
crazy crazy nude this is like intensely
new so I'm only going to like tap it on
my lips and then I'm going to top it off
with the covergirl jumbo gloss balm and
ballet twist just kind of top it with
that
okay guys and that's it of course you
can change the lipstick you want to wear
you can go a little bit darker but I
love how this look looks with like
really light nude pink lips anyway I
hope you enjoyed this video please

will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
