whole vlog thing which is pretty pretty
hard I would say I don't know actually
on our way to my mom's house to get in
the pool because it is my little nephews
second birthday he is my youngest nephew
and it is his birthday today so we are
going to go get in the pool and I'm
going to try to vlog them because there
I usually like I talk a lot about Sophia
and Noah which are my sister's kids but
I don't really show you guys my
brother's kids he has three sons and
okay I didn't even realize the radio was
on that was annoying I'm sorry um he has
three sons so I'm going to try to get
them in action because they are
hilarious so I don't know yeah that's
what we were that's what we are doing
I'm actually just parked outside my
house right now waiting for Amelia to
get in the car because I hate driving on
the highway I know it's like a big issue
of mine I hate driving on the highway so
Amelia drives my car to get to my mom's
house because I have to go to the
highway so I know that's pretty pathetic
something I'm working on but you know
what can I do so hopefully I will see
you guys soon
yeah
okay so that was an epic fail I got
maybe like two minutes worth of footage
if that um I suck at vlogging basically
I have come to realize that vlogging is
not my forte I got there with every
intention of vlogging but then I just
got in the pool and I wasn't going to
walk around with my camera if I was in
the pool obviously so that was a
disaster I'm sorry and honestly my life
is not that interesting for me to vlog I
feel like when Danny gets back I will do
a lot more vlogs um I'll make a vlog
channel I'll do that kind of thing when
you know Danny's back because we do a
lot more interesting things when we're
together but when he's on deployment
it's kind of it's kind of a bummer so I
don't really do like fun vlog ease stuff
when he's not around so I'm sorry if
you're watching this and you're like oh
this sucks sorry and excuse my
appearance I'm in like one of those
baseball tees with my hair really puffy
right now like it's just like it's got a
mind of its own today and I have no
makeup on I actually just came back from
Cosmoprof if you don't know what Cosmo
Prof is it's a beauty store that sells
you know like shampoos and conditioners
hair dyes hair tools all that stuff but
you need a license to shop there like
you need a Cosmo Prof card you need to
be a member to shop there um
and I don't have my license for hair or
anything like that but my mom does my
mom is a hairdresser and so is my friend
Gabby so whenever I need to buy
something I just go with them and I just
came back and I get a lot of questions
about my hair like on a daily basis like
what color it is and stuff I'm telling
you guys this because not only don't get
a lot of questions on it but I am dying
my roots today because my mom Wow
that is terribly unattractive I'm using
the same thing I used on the rest of my
hair which is why I'm telling you guys
this because it is the joy coke barrel
capac color so for my roots I am just
using an 8 n it is a medium blonde and
the developer I'm using it is 30 this
one's also the very okay pack I really
really like joy Co for my hair I've used
like their treatments and I've used
their hair dyes and I really really like
joy coat for my hair so yeah I'm going
to be doing this today just in case you
guys wanted to know I'm not going to
film the process because my friend gabby
is the one that's doing it for me and I
sure would feel about being on camera
and have people watching her so also I
have the funniest video to show you guys
I'm going to insert a clip right after
this but I went over to my sister's
mother-in-law's house for Mother's Day
and we did the nasty jelly bean
challenge
you probably seen it here a bunch of
times on YouTube it is the bean boozled
challenge where you get like a good
jelly bean and a bad jelly bean and two
people have to try it and you kind of
have to guess what flavor you get and
there's like gross flavours and stuff so
I did it with my sister and Sophia and
it was hilarious
Sophia was not up for it she honestly
thought that every Delevingne she got
was good until she realized until she
saw our reaction stem and she was like I
don't
this anymore but my sister was the
funniest ever I have to do I have to
share it with you guys because it was
literally so funny so yeah I'm going to
insert that right now hey okay right
wait say hi Sofia hi everybody hey

can't eat it until I say okay okay I'm
the guess what it is okay ready imagine

okay bye guys come on okay so this vlog
was a little bit pointless um it's like
I said I suck at vlogging not even to
pretend I'm good probably not gonna post
this I'm not gonna lie
probably not gonna post this probably
talking to myself right now I mean I
really all do much I really don't do
much I sit here and wait but seriously
right now I'm gonna go pick up my sister
and we're gonna spend a sister day
together I might vlog if Sophia does
anything funny I might record her
because I know how much you guys really
like Sophia so maybe but so I'm not
promising anything
I can't believe you suck on your mom

why would your mom lie to me why would
she tell me you suck her toes if you
don't I cannot believe you so gross
violation help like you told us and
bleep Yeah right
I'm up here with ya I know girl that's
how you like it so I hope you liked this
vlog and I hope whenever I do fun stuff
if I ever do fun stuff and I record them
that you enjoy those this was a rough
draft this is the pilot okay yeah
think of this vlog as a pilot to a show
of my life and it's probably going to
get really bad ratings but it's a pilot
you can't expect much from a pilot
do you really fall in love with
characters in a pilot No
