a highly requested video a lot of people
have been asking me all about my makeup
brushes the ones I use and which ones
are my favorites so that's what this
video is going to be about
I'm still pretty congested like I've had
a cold for a long time and I don't
understand I probably need to go to the
hospital because I don't think anybody
anybody has a stuffy nose and a cough
for this long but anyway the Sun is
going to be coming in and out of this
room it's a really gloomy day today so
the Sun like peeks in every once in a
while so with the shadows on my face do
you see them like I know the lighting is
terrible today but gangrel the weather
and that's what sucks when you have
natural light I'm going to invest in
some really good lights hopefully soon
so don't hang me okay so I'm just gonna
jump right in I don't want this video to
be too long but basically I'm just going
to talk about my most loved makeup
brushes and you're all sitting right in
front of me as you can see I have a ton
of Brooklyn out of town I don't have
that many but I have a bunch of brushes
just sitting right behind me and I do
love them but I'm just going to be
talking about my absolute fave and I'm
going to start with my face brushes and
then I'm going to show you my favorite
eye brushes as well like I said I
narrowed it down to my must-haves and
these are the ones honestly that I use
like every single day so for foundation
my absolute favorite foundation brush is
the Real Techniques buffing brush I
prefer it over the Real Techniques
expert face brush that a lot of people
like for their foundation I just feel
like it buffs my foundation in perfectly
especially if you have a foundation that
goes on a little bit streaky I don't get
streaky marks with this bad guy I love
this brush and the best part is is that
it's really inexpensive it comes in a
set of four but I use those other
brushes all the time too so it's not
like a waste of money I really really
love this brush super affordable amazing
for my concealer I also use a Real
Techniques brush I really love them and
I use the contour brush this is supposed
to be for your contour which obviously
that would work amazingly for that I
used to use it as a contour brush but I
find that it blends my under-eye
concealer so perfectly I'll just put on
some concealer and then I'll just blend
it out with this brush and
so sets my undereye concealer really
nicely like it picks up just enough
product to apply right underneath my
eyes and it's small enough where it gets
right up under there this also came in
the set with this so I really love these
brushes to set my foundation I just use
a large powder brush I use a Sigma one I
don't I think it's the F 30 I could be
completely wrong but I'm not showing it
to you because I don't think it's
anything out of this world I think every
large powder brush pretty much does the
exact same thing so I'm not mentioning
that for contour my absolute favorite
brush in the whole world is the Sigma
angled kabuki brush this is the F 84 I
love this to contour my face I just put
it in my powder and then I just carve
out the hollows of my face it does a
really good job of blending you put some
on your forehead and if it's a little
bit too intense you went a little too
heavy all you got to do is just blend it
out and I swear it like blends this
brush blends bronzer like a dream guys
like a dream which is why I love it so
much because sometimes sometimes a girl
can get a little crazy with the bronzer
you know and then you got to blend it
I'm going to give a quick little
honorable mention when it comes to
contouring because I have been using
this one a lot too and it is the Sigma
tapered highlighter f-35 I'm mentioning
this because it's so multifunctional I
feel I use this to contour my face I use
this to set my concealer I use this for
a highlighter which is the purpose of
this it's you know to highlight your
face this brush works in so many ways I
think it's really good I use it all the
time it's one of my favorite brushes
ever which is why I just had to mention
it I'm sorry about the shadow but my
favorite brush of all time to highlight
with it is this brush right here I do
not know the name of it it is from
Coastal Scents it's just one of those
like uh do fiber brushes like oh my god
the ones like this do a fiber
yes yeah I'm saying that right it's it
them so second guess yourself Kathleen I
love that it's one of those dual fiber
brushes because it doesn't pick up too
much product and sometimes when you're
highlighting your face you're like oh
god I just just I went overboard
with this brush I never go overboard I
got this brush in a set I bought a roll
of brushes from Coastal Scents a couple
years ago and I actually really liked
those brushes a lot of you asked me
about my Coastal Scents brushes and I
think that they're pretty good for the
price I don't think you can feed them
when it comes to blush I don't think
I've ever found a brush better than this
one and it is the it cosmetics blush
brush I don't own any brush that's as
soft as this one it is like butter like
oh like I could do this all day it's the
perfect size it's not too big for your
face but it's not too small where you
feel like you're only putting blush in
like a little section of your face the
only downside is the price this isn't
really pricey brush all the a cosmetics
brush are no expensive not a little day
expensive but I think they're worth
every penny I've only heard good things
about the a cosmetics brushes and I'm
gonna buy some more with time because
they expensive when I want to get an
all-over bronzed look my favorite brush
is the Real Techniques blush brush you
can use this for a blush I've used it
for a blush before it works it's just a
little bit too large for some people and
I totally get that but for bronzer this
is amazing it deposits just enough
bronzer where it's not overboard that's
my thing I hate brushes that literally
deposit like the entire product on your
face and you're like great not what so I
really love that it's just the perfect
size for bronzer it deposits just enough
bronzer and it is really inexpensive
which is great okay so really quickly
I'm going to talk about my favorite eye
brushes um the best brush in my opinion
to pack on color on your lid is this one
right here this is oh by the way um
these brushes are dirty I literally just
used it for my makeup so this is my
favorite brush to pack on color this is
the Mac 239 I know that Sigma makes one
probably the exact same and it's
probably cheaper so but I really really
love this two pack on the lid because it
is small enough to where you're not
packing too much and it gets into your
crease but it's not too tiny you know
what I mean it's like the perfect size I
love this brush for that perfect
blended transition color I really love
using the Sigma tapered blending be
forty this is perfect this brush is
literally perfect it will blend any
color into your crease like a dream it's
big and fluffy and extremely soft it's
not going to scratch your eyes at all I
hate scratchy iron brushes this one's
good but my number one hands-down best
eye brush in the history of the world
that I will repurchase over and over
again is the Mac 217 this is the perfect
little blending brush it is a lot
smaller as you can see then the Sigma
tapered blending but this is more for
like your crease and like blowing out
eye looks this is to get like a more
precise blend I like using it on the
outer view of my eye and then packing it
into my crease when I want a more
dramatic crease or when I want to pack
more color on versus this one this I
think that everyone should have this
brush I know it's pretty pricey but
honestly when it comes to makeup I think
that it's this brush is an essential
brush personally that's the way I feel
when I want a super super super super
precise crease color I use this one
right here this is just a tiny little
domed shadow brush from Coastal Scents
again I don't know the name of this
brush I came in my brush roll but it's
so tiny and so soft that it literally
packs on the color in the crease like
this is the perfect cut crease brush
like when I want to do a cut crease this
is the bad boy I use it is really
precise really really soft and it
actually blends out really nicely for
blending out the shadows on my lower
lash line I always use the Sigma pencil
e-40 brush honestly I think all pencil
brushes do the same thing but this is
the act this is the only pencil brush I
own and I use the crap out of it and
it's still going strong and I love it I
love that it's not too soft but it's not
stiff at all but don't don't get scared
it's soft and it blends eyes shadows out
like a dream I really love this brush
Sigma brushes as you know are amazing I
love them for a really soft application
like a shadow that goes just all over
your lid from lash line to brow bone I
always use
my Coastal Scents giant giant giant
fluffy brush I use this for my highlight
sometimes just a pack on one color all
over the lid it just gives a really soft
romantic look and I use this brush all
the time and I just had to mention it
because I really love it this again came
in my little Coastal Scents brush roll
okay so I have two favorite eyeliner
brushes that I use all the time the
first one is this elf small angled brush
it's just a tiny little angled brush
obviously I like it though because it's
really stiff it's not going to go
anywhere I like using this for eyeshadow
though whenever I want to like winged
out powder eyeshadow I use this all the
time or whenever I want to pack gel on
my waterline or something like that
I like using this brush it's nice some
on and stiff and it's three dollars at
Target my favorite brush to apply gel
eyeliner is this little brush right here
that has no name it just says flat
shader and it's from simply Simmons I
got this brush at michaels you can
actually find pretty good brushes and
michaels when it comes to like gel
eyeliner and stuff like that i love it
because it's super thin and super flat i
get the perfect flicked out uhm gel
eyeliner look with this it's incredible
like I'm obsessed with this and it only
cost me two dollars at michaels you
really can't beat that and they have a
bunch of different ones from the
thinnest thinnest little little tiny
brush to like really thick one site go
to michaels and check out these little
eyeliner brushes which they're not for
eyeliner but and then my last favorite
eye brush is the eye brush i use to fill
in my eyebrows and it is this brush
right here it is from royal and
langnickel I also got this at michaels
it is just a flat just like a flat brush
and this is the perfect eyebrow brush it
like carves it out perfectly and you get
really precise sharp lines i've been
using it to fit up my eyebrows every
single day since i bought it this is a
fairly new brush to me i got about two
or three months ago and that's all i've
been using and this is all i will ever
use I'm obsessed with this brush it's
amazing go buy it okay so that's the end
