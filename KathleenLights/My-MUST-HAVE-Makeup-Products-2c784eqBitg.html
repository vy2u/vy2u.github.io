my must-have makeup products of all time
um kind of like how to explain it the
products that if they run out will when
they run out I have to go out and
immediately buy it again because it's a
must-have like in my makeup collection I
just need these products so I wanted to
do it by category like primers which my
favorite primer of all time foundations
with my favorite foundation of all time
favorite bronzer of all time favorite
eyeshadows of all time blush of all time
you know stuff like that um
just products that have been my favorite
since I since I started getting into
makeup just you know really great
products in my opinion so yeah I'm just
going to go ahead and show you guys
okay so first I'm going to start with
face primers my favorite face primer is
the hard candy sheer envy primer and I
love this
I like silicone based primers more than
like cream primers um that's just me
this is a silicone based primer which is
good for people with large pores because
it just it fills them in and it just
gives you like a really smooth um
canvas for your foundation and yeah so I
know a lot of people love the benefit
Porefessional primer but if you hold
these side-by-side the ingredients in
the hard-candy primer are the same
ingredients that are in the professional
the professional does have more
ingredients than this one does so I
guess it is a little better probably
works a little better but the
professional literally has all the
ingredients that this one does oh this
is a good alternative if you don't want
you want to spend the money on that one
I really just sucked yeah i really
suggest checking out the sheer envy 1
because it's really good and it's my
babies okay foundations this one was a
no-brainer
my favorite foundation of all time is
the revlon colorstay
this is like really dark but this is my
son
Foundation well last summer it's getting
close to summer and I'm like still pale
as it goes anyway um I have the one
that's normal to dry skin for normal to
dry skin because I have dry skin and
what's amazing about this foundation is
that it doesn't cake me up which usually
full coverage foundations do that and
this one doesn't do that it's this is
like a miracle in a bottle I don't know
what I don't know what it is that's so
amazing about this it just glides on
smoothly literally like it glides on
smoothly it doesn't kick up at all I
already said that covers you know
blemishes well redness well it just it
covers law and it looks it looks
airbrushed you know if you apply it the
right way it looks airbrushed and it
looks natural but it covers everything
this is amazing okay
concealers now I'm not going to mention
an under-eye concealer because I still
haven't found my Holy Grail oh my god I
need that under-eye concealer for the
rest of my life kind of concealer I use
this one all the time if you watch my
videos you see me using this one like
you might get ready with me videos or my
tutorials I like how it kind of
brightens my under-eye area since it's a
few shades lighter than my skin but it
settles into my lines a little bit and
oh my god there's the cutest dog'
outside and after a while I can tell
it's like settled in my lines and I look
like a little old woman after a while
with this so it's not my favorite
they're things I like about the things I
don't like about it so I can't say that
it's a must-have so I won't lie to you
guys so pretend I didn't showed you that
but I'm saying I don't have it I could
under eye concealer to show you but
tables you want to cover than pimples I
got the product for you
the hard candy glamoflauge concealer I'm
sure you guys have seen this before
it says heavy duty concealer and they
are absolutely right this covers tattoos
I've covered my tattoo here with this
before and Danny's literally like what
what tattoo and I'm like oh my god you
can't see it right it covers it it's
amazing this tattoo is that true this
container will cover anything so
literally like I don't really break out
all that much I don't have like crazy
you know acne that forms but when I do
get acne it's like one this big and like
on my nose but I literally just dab a
little on my finger place it on my
pimple and my pimple disappears this
will cover anything and the little goes
a long way and this will last you
forever and I think it's six dollars so
it's pretty cute okay so for face powder
um I never really used to wear face
powder because my skin is so dry for the
50th time and any face powder I use to
make me really cakey like any face
powder I use but I finally found a
powder that works amazing for me and it
is the Mac mineralized skinfinish
natural in the color this is the color
medium it's just literally it's a
natural face powder and I could put
layers and layers and layers and layers
of this and I don't live cakey which is
so amazing for me so this is really good
if you have dry skin I suggest checking
this powder out if you're scared of
powders I'm sure this works for oily
skin - I mean I don't know but just it's
so natural and it just doesn't look
cakey at all it's beautiful I don't know
what I ever did without this I will
continue to purchase this over and over
again okay next I want to talk about
bronzers and I have two to show you
because one is like my absolute favorite
for contouring and then the other one
is my favorite like overall bronzer you
know what I mean you know and the one
that I love for contouring is the NYC
smooth skin Ron's a face powder in the
color sunny and it looks like this and I
know that this looks pretty orange when
I put it up to my skin but it's not
orange at all when I put it on my face I
like to contour with this and just up in
my temples and this is great for that I
love it $2 so cheap and it's a really
good really really good matte bronzer I
would say that it's better for people
who are like lighter and skin tone
because it is kind of light it is a
little bit light if if you're darker in
skin tone and you want to contour I
think it might be a little bit too light
but yeah so for my favorite um kind of
like an overall glow kind of bronzer I
love the Mac bronzing powder and refine
golden this is broken so let's see how
I'm going to do this
okay
my husband like all the video you just
heard him scream no okay um
okay this is what it looks like guys a
little bit you know but this is gonna
fall all over me so I'm going to close
it but I just kind of wanted to show you
what it looks like even though you can't
really see it right now but it's a deep
bronzer with like little tiny specks of
glitter not glitter but like little
shimmers in it and it's not shimmery in
the sense that you're gonna wear and
people are going to think you're one of
the cons or anything like that it just
gives you like a glow like when I wear
this I feel like I've been out in the
Sun for hours and then I just have like
that healthy kissed by the Sun kind of
bronzing going on you know what I mean I
love that bronzer that's probably my
third time buying that I love it okay
for blush I'm sorry I'm mentioning like
another Mac product but this is my
favorite blush a long time it is Melba
by Mac and it's the prettiest color I
love Matt um Matt blushes I'm a person
that like really really loves a matte
blush just to go crazy with like a
highlight you know because I feel like
if you wear shimmery blush you don't
really need a highlight and I like
highlight I like to highlight so I just
I love matte blushes and this is my
favorite one ever um if you know any
drugstore blushes that are that have
really nice matte ones let me know down
below because I want to extend my matte
blush collection and I want to not spend
so much money on it but anyway um this
blush is beautiful it's like a it's like
a peachy pink
let me swatch it so as you can see it's
like a peachy but corally pink I would
say not like peach it's really hard to
describe this color for some strange
reason but I mean you see it there so
this is what it looks like and I love it
I feel like it looks good on a lot of
different skin tones and it just it's
one of those blushes that you can wear
like just mascara and you put this on
and you'll look like completely done you
look like put together and so pretty
this looks really good with like a tan
in the summer and it's really really
pigmented so you could either go full-on
crazy with this blush with just like a
touch of color and it looks really great
okay for highlighting I'm kind of
cheating a little bit because I just
bought this this month actually and it
is the magic lumi like enthusing primer
but after about this I will I will
always repurchase this this thing is
amazing I'm not going to talk about it
too much because I want to talk about it
in my monthly favorites I don't know why
I just smelled that really weird but I
have Mac's
soft and gentle highlight I mean it's a
powder highlight so you can't even tell
you can't really have comparison but I
have this that everybody who said it was
the best thing that ever happened to
them I mean I don't love it I don't know
what it is I feel like it's very
glittery and I like more of a sheen than
glitter I don't know but the this is
supposed to be a primer but oh my god
it's just the most beautiful highlight
and even though I've only had it for
like a month
I will always always always refer just
that okay for eye primers it was either
this or the Urban Decay primer potion
but I had to go with this
this is Mac's painterly paint-pot it's
just a pinky tone like cream color base
and the reason why I like this so much
is because it high it covers my veins
really well and I have like crazy like
Frankenstein in veins on
and this just like masks them and it
doesn't make my eyeshadows crease and it
makes them last all day I love this and
I do love the Maybelline Color tattoos I
was gonna add that but they don't have a
cream color base like this I don't know
what they're waiting for to put like a
matte like not shimmery solid creamy
color like what are they waiting for for
that I'm just dying for that to happen
so that I could buy that I not have to
buy this anymore because the color
choices are just as good as this but
they don't have a color like this and I
love I love this okay now I want to talk
about a shadow I have three things to
show you and um the first one is a
palette and the other two are just two
separate eyeshadows and my must have a
shadow palette of all time is my Naked
palette you've seen it all before you've
seen this a million times
this is in my opinion better than naked
- I have naked - and I don't reach for
nearly as much as I reach for this one
it's it's just very me I'm very very I
like warmer colors that's just I like
how they compliment my eyes more it's
just you can do so many looks with this
it's just like light colors over here
you can get really sultry and smoky over
here it's just amazing travel-friendly
take it everywhere and you have
everything you're ever going to need
this color right here called smog is
actually one of my favorite eyeshadows
of all time it's just beautiful I just
think that this palette is definitely a
must-have and if I hit pan on every
single one I'm going to buy it again I
love this okay the only thing that that
palette lacks is a really good black and
I like my blacks to be met and my
absolute favorite must-have black
eyeshadow is wedding wilds panther it's
a dollar this little square is a dollar
and it is really really black it's very
very
cake and creamy and very black so this
is my favorite black eye shadow ever and
then I feel like it wouldn't be myself
if I didn't mention this one eye shadow
and it is a Mac eye shadow and it's
called amber lights I mentioned this in
my top 10 favorite Mac eye shadows but
it is the most beautiful eyeshadow I've
ever seen in the entire world if all my
eyeshadows broke right now and I had to
only have one for the rest of my life it
would be this it's just like a pretty
copper gold it's like oh my god this
looks beautiful with like a tan in the
summer I literally would just put my
scare on put this all over my eye and
I'd be good to go
it's just it's perfect it's it's perfect
it was probably my first shot no it's
like I think it was like my third eye
shadow I ever bought from Mac and it's
you okay so let's talk eyeliner um my
favorite eyeliner in the entire world is
the Maybelline master drama I use this
all the time literally all the time
it's one of those like you know these
kind of things that's the kind of
eyeliner it is and I love that I don't
have to sharpen it but that's not the
best part this is so black it's so this
beats so many high-end eyeliners like my
Mac ones don't compare my lorac ones
that I have have to lock ones that suck
they don't compare and this just goes on
so creamy and so I mean I'm just like I
didn't even push it hard it's just black
so black and it's really creamy so you
can smudge it out but then it stays in
place all day I literally don't know
what I would do if this like was ever
discontinued like I don't know what I
would do
okay for a liquid liner my favorite is
the Maybelline line stiletto I love this
because it's a felt tip and it has like
a it's not the finished like felt tip
applicator but you can do your liner
praisin with it though and what I love
about this is that it's really good if
you're really bad at liquid liner
because it's stiff and it's like really
easy to do it was one of my first like
liquid liners that I ever use and I
found that was really easy also it's
really really black and doesn't bleed at
all you and this is just code black that
is this looks great now because I've
literally tried to rub it off and it's
not coming off that's how good that
Maybelline drama eyeliner is but do you
see how black it is it's it's amazing
and it lasts a really long time like
I've had it for a while and it's still
going strong so that's good mascara time
oh this is my favorite ever it's the
Clinique lash doubling mascara gives me
insane amount of volume an insane amount
of length I have yet to find a mascara
that's as good as this and I mean I'm on
the hunt but this will always be my baby
I will always have this mascara in my
collection
boys okay and lastly I want to talk
about lipstick and this was so hard for
me to just choose one that I was like a
must-have because I feel like all my
lipsticks are must-haves on the lipstick
junkie but it is Mac's creme de nude and
this is what it looks like
this is a swatch of it right there it's
just the perfect nude isn't like ugly
that ignore that it's the perfect nude
and if I had to have just one lipstick
for the rest of my life it would be this
one it's just one of those lipsticks
that I need to have um it looks good
with so many different looks
it's the perfect nude in my opinion but
this one looks good on everybody
literally everybody perfect lipstick
okay guys that's it these are like my
must-have makeup products of all time I
hope this was helpful in some way thank
you so much for watching guys please
