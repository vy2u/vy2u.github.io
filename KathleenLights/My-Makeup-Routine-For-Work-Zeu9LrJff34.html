ridiculous it's getting bad hey guys so
I woke up a little bit earlier than
normal today and I'm about ready to go
to work and I'm just sitting here
messing with Cornelius's hair
anyway so I've decided to do kind of
like a chit chat getting ready with me
video today because I am getting ready
to go to work and I do the exact same
thing every single day like my makeup
routine doesn't change at all when I'm
getting ready to go to work just because
it's so simple and fast and honestly the
only thing that does change from day to
day is my eye makeup I'll change it
sometimes and do different eye shadow
looks or whatever but that's basically
the only thing that changes from day to
day it's my eye makeup because the
things I put on my face I put them on
every time I'm gonna go to work oh yeah
I am NOT filming this video in front of
my window like I would typically do
during the day because this guy is black
like this morning when Danny and I woke
up he was like oh my god it's so dark
outside like the sky is black tropical
storm Karen is in full effect guys full
effect anyway before I talk your ear off
today I'm going to be using the bare
minerals jewel in the Epiphany I spoke
about this in my favorites video it's
what I've been wearing on my eyes to
work almost every single day by the way
my shirt looks incredibly baggy like in
the video it's because I'm sitting down
and I like wrinkles up when I sit down
it's so annoying but I stand the entire
day at work so
okay so the first thing I always do is I
spray fix+ all over my face like I
drench my face and then I just kind of
rub it in with my fingers and the reason
why I do this is I feel like it really
calms my redness and it kind of wakes me
up in the morning I mean I still wash my
face in the morning and then I put on my
moisturizer or whatever but I feel like
this kind of helps my skin a lot when I
spray it in the morning like it wakes me
up and I feel like kind of like makes my
skin come to life if that makes any
sense to anybody maybe I'm delusional
but I love spraying this on my face in
the morning before I put on my makeup
okay so I never wear foundation to work
ever I just hate the feeling of having
foundation on while I my work drives me
crazy so I just used concealer instead
and I have been using this concealer for
a few months now I got in a mixie bag a
couple months ago it's the yeah B
concealer and this is in the color buff
as you can tell I've hit quite a lot of
pan I love this concealer it doesn't
make my face look cakey which I love
and it doesn't cling on to my dry
patches
so just put that on all my red areas
by the way I look like Scary Spice right
now with my hair like my hair is puffy
as heck this laptop is like bothering me
my hair is extremely puffy right now I'm
probably just going to end up throwing
it in a bun on my way to work because I
can't I can't look like a chia pet
so yeah now that I'm done putting on
concealer I'm gonna have some under-eye
concealer by the way I've been on the
hunt very very good creamy concealer
kind of like in a pot where I can just
dab on my redness and ran perfections
and stuff like that and then just head
out the door and I haven't found
anything that works well with my dry
skin so a few guys to know of a good
concealer that's you know good for dry
skin dry pimples and stuff please let me
know anyway so the under-eye container I
use on the day-to-day basis is my
maybelline instant age rewind because
it's not heavy and you know it does
cover up well enough without feeling so
thick so anyway I just kind of bring it
down like this to cover up not only my
dark circles but the redness on my
cheeks a little bit mmm they sound so
raspy in the mornings I'm sorry and then
I just blend it in with my fingers and
this honestly takes me a 15 minutes in
the morning probably taking him over and
out cuz I'm just sitting here talking
then I go in and just set everything
with a powder and surprise surprise
using my Maybelline no my mac mineralize
skinfinish natural and medium it's like
the best powder in the world especially
me I've dry skin
so I just pretty much gotten this over
my entire face
I'll pay my RESP eNOS
okay so then the last thing I do now
face is just add a little bit of bronzer
because after the concealer and the
powder kind of look a little pale so I
just like to add some color back to my
skin and I have been using my Mac
bronzing powder and refine golden it is
a little shimmery but I'm not try to
contour here or anything I just really
want to bronze up my face so I've been
using this
and I can never put on bronze on my face
without just completely destroying my
hair even though my hair is Wilin out
okay so that's all I did my face just
quick and natural you know now I'm just
really quickly going to fill in my
eyebrows and for that I use Mac's quark
eyeshadow I always use this and I use it
with a little Coastal Scents angled
brush I'm going to be doing this
off-camera just but I can do it as fast
as I can but I am going to be filming an
eyebrow routine how I groove them how I
fill them in and all that stuff and that
will be coming up very soon so stay
tuned for that if you're interested but
really quickly I am just going to fill
in my eyebrows and it will be right back
okay so I just finished filling them in
and they're looking a little bit ratchet
right now because kind of letting them
grow out so I can show you how I move
them in stuff so I'm kind of letting
them do their thing for a little while
before I film that video
that's why looking a little funky to me
so for my eyes I'm just going to be
taking Mac's painterly paint-pot and I'm
going to prime my eyes
okay really quickly before I get started
I just have to mention this because I
feel like someone might comment and be
like that's too much makeup to wear to
work but I don't think so
honestly I will work in any fancy type
of place where you have to look like
extremely business appropriate or
anything like that so honestly like my
supervisor wears fake lashes to work and
everything so I mean tweets their own
anyway I'm going to be taking max quark
it's what I use to fill in my eyebrows
and I'm taking it on any Sigma e-40 it's
just a big blending brush and I'm going
to be putting this in my crease
now I'm just taking my bareMinerals the
Epiphany duo and it just looks like this
and it is beautiful and I am taking my
ELF eyeshadow see brush does anybody
know what the C stands for in this brush
because I don't color eyeshadow color I
don't know and I'm just taking this
taupe color right here and this is going
to go all over my entire lid I know why
but I love this brush with this
eyeshadow like it packs it on like crazy
I don't know how to explain it
I just take that all the way up to my
crease
I'm seriously in love with this taupe
color it's just so beautiful
anyway now I just take my Mac 217 and I
take the brown in this little duo and
work that on the outer part of my eye
and into my crease a little
just a little bit not too much just to
kind of give some depth to the outer
part of my eye but I don't want it to be
like you know too much
then I just take my Maybelline master
drama eyeliner and I line my waterline
then with just a pencil brush like this
I go back into that core color and I
just put this on my lower lashes
and that's typically all I do with my
eyes I rarely ever put like a brow bone
highlight or a highlight right in here
just because I usually don't feel the
need to or I'm trying to leave as soon
as possible but yeah now I'm just going
to go in with my L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black mascara
and I don't know how I feel about this
mascara I like the volume it gives but
it kind of flakes off a little bit
and then I have to wait till I dries and
wipe it off and it's kind of irritating
but it it is good I also put some of
that on my lower lashes as well just a
little bit okay and that is everything I
do on my face honestly I feel like I can
wear this I look every single day and I
won't get bored there is just something
about that bareMinerals duel that I love
so much it's the perfect taupe and that
Brown just deepens it so nicely I just
love that combination so much so any
when it comes to my lips I either wear
chapstick or like something like this
this is what I want to think pink and
I'll just kind of dab that on my lips
just to give some color and have it
stain my lips a little bit and that'll
just expand my lips for the rest of the
day when I tap on lipstick like this and
then I do another little spritz of fix+
just cuz I love this thing so much you
guys know okay so that's it this is kind
of like my makeup routine for work it's
what I do pretty much every time I go to
work
and I know this might seem like a lot of
makeup for some people but honestly it's
just some concealer and some powder and
some bronzer just to warm up my face a
little bit the eye makeup like I said
changes a lot I've just been using that
duo for quite some time now
but sometimes I just put on mascara and
go to work it really the eye makeup
changes all the time so yeah anyway I
