tell I don't know what to do with my
setup I don't know I don't know what my
background should be or what it's gonna
look like I'm trying to find the perfect
angles to where the light hits perfectly
and all that stuff so until I do a lot
of these test runs where I'm filming in
different parts of this room I don't
know how my filming setup is gonna be I
don't think it's gonna be this one
but anyway so today's video is the start
of a new series I'm doing on my channel
I want to do this video twice a month or
once every two weeks and basically I
asked you guys on social media like on
Twitter and Instagram if you guys wanted
to see this series I'm gonna title it my
makeup stash and okay so like a couple
months ago three months ago I did a
makeup collection video on my channel it
was like 27 minutes long but you guys
really just got a glimpse of my makeup
collection I didn't really go through
each individual product and talk about
it and tell you guys if I loved it if I
just kind of liked it and stuff like
that because it is like a large
collection I just showed you guys an
overview of things so I thought it would
be a good idea to do like a my makeup
stash kind of video and today's video is
going to be dedicated to bronzers
they're all sitting over here and it
just goes it's all over my desk like all
of this and basically what these videos
are going to consist of is I'm going to
break my entire makeup collection into
part in two sections so today's video is
going to be bronzers I'm going to talk
about all of the bronzers I own and
we're just going to talk about them so
it's gonna be my bronzer collection a
lot of you guys thought it was a really
good idea I mean I get questions every
single day since I posted that like when
are you going to start this series like
it's been highly highly requested since
I mentioned it so the series is starting
today I will do blushes next in like two
weeks or so if you guys like the series
if you guys freaking hate it then I
won't do it I think the only one I won't
do is lip products I won't go through my
lip part
collection because there's so many that
the video would be like ridiculous this
video is probably going to be ridiculous
if you guys didn't know my weakness is
bronzers I freaking love bronzers like
and they all pretty much the same they
don't do the same thing there's contour
and all that stuff there's bronzing the
shimmer there's Matt but I'm obsessed
with bronzers and you will see right now
okay so I'm going to go ahead and get
started and I'm going to start in no
particular order I'm just gonna grab
prongs or show it and talk about it I'm
going to start off with my ultimate
favorite bronzer I use this not only to
like just bronze my face with the
contour as well this is the Sephora sole
video bronzing powder this was limited
edition insta Fora I really wish that
they would just bring this back I did a
whole video on this where I reviewed it
it's my favorite it smells like tropical
flowers it's that perfect undertone for
me I recommend this for like light to
light medium skin tones I think medium
skin tones can wear this as well it's my
favorite it literally cast a perfect
shadow but it's not a she
it's perfect and you get so much product
in here and it wasn't that expensive
since it's from the Sephora collection
I'm gonna try to go through these fast
because Who am I kiddin
my videos I put got to open this this is
the bare minerals the beach is waiting
bronzer I got this actually like three
months ago and I wanted it for the
summer because it has a shimmery bronzer
here a more like cool toned shimmery
bronzer like down the center this one's
like a little gold and this one is matte
but it has like a reddish undertone so
mixed all together this is a beautiful
like warm glowy bronzer so yeah I think
the packaging is beautiful it has a nice
mirror it came with a fan brush and a
lip gloss and it was a really cool set
at Sephora so I actually really like
this bronzer this is the L'Oreal True
Match um super blendable powder in the
shade c8 cocoa so this is technically a
face powder you know like a setting
powder or a face powder for deep burst
in tones but I use it as a contour shade
because it's a really really pretty
color and this blends beautifully if you
guys are looking for a really nice
contour powder from the drugstore
I recommend the True Match powder
because they blend like a dream since
they're meant to be like face powders I
am actually wearing this on my face
today I have another bronzer on top but
I'm wearing this on my face and I love
it by the way the foundation I'm wearing
is the cover FX custom cover drops and
I'm wearing it by itself
I didn't mix it with anything and I
don't care I have this Tarte Park of
princess little set it has the hazard
Marin has the Park Avenue princess
bronzer a blush and a highlight and
honestly have you ever have you guys
ever seen me use this like I never even
touched this product at all so I
actually think I'm going to pass this to
my sister this isn't a decluttering
video but now that I look at it I don't
really see myself using it only because
I don't know it's a great product I just
pick up other bronzers other highlights
and other blushes as well so I mean this
is a very famous bronzer but I think my
sister would really appreciate this
someone passed that on to her but this
is the NARS contouring what is it's
called
this doesn't have a name but it's the
contouring duo or contouring powder from
NARS I have mine in Paloma and this is
what it looks like it has like the
contour shade and then a light creamy
pinky whitish kind of color I really
like these kinds of pinky colors for
underneath my eyes because I feel like
they cancel out like the Blues
underneath my eyes and the darkness I
don't like like super yellow powders
underneath my eyes so I really like that
for that and I love this contour powder
because it has like a pink undertone so
it kind of looks like it blends in
really nicely with the blushes that I
put on top I really love this little duo
I think it's multifunctional I really
really like it so that's Paloma this is
the Milani
what Milani malonic this is the Milani
tantastic face and body baked bronzer
and fantastic in gold I've had this
forever it's amazing in the summer to
just dust all over your body or to warm
up the cheeks I use this in a full-face
drugstore tutorial it just has a
beautiful golden Sheen oh my god have I
not been watching I haven't even been
watching any of these products I'm a
freaking failure so it has this golden
Sheen I you can't tell there because it
is it's like a bronzer with a highlight
mixed in one this could definitely be a
highlight for a lot of people it's
actually a highlight even for me as fair
as I am but I kind of like to mix it
with my bronzer that's why I left it in
here because I mean it's called a baked
bronzer but this is both to me a bronzer
or a highlight I have all three of the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzers I
have the regular chocolate Soleil the
dark chocolate Soleil and the milk
chocolate Soleil which the milk
chocolate is my favorite out of all of
them I'll swatch them for you these are
one of my favorite bronzers in the
entire world for contouring for warming
up the skin
they are literally beautiful oh I like
them all for different reasons the milk
chocolate Soleil looks like this on the
inside and as you can see it's very
light it's actually this one right here
swatched at the very top and I like it
because it's really hard to find
bronzers for super fair-skinned and this
is perfect because you can contour with
it and it doesn't look muddy it doesn't
look ashy it's just it's all around like
a really beautiful blendable goodness
and then the chocolate Soleil is my
other favorite because it's a little bit
deeper so it's a more pigmented but it
has a nice undertone it's not too warm
not too cool it's the one right in the
middle as you can see it's a lot cooler
than this one so the milk chocolate I
mean the chocolate Soleil is perfect for
contouring and then the dark chocolate
Soleil I even like it as fair as I am
because it gives a little bit of a
peanut buttery look to my face I know
that's really weird but sometimes I like
that warmth on my face and this gives it
to me it's the one all the way at the
bottom this is great for darker skin
tones the
Nastasia contour kit I'm including it
even though I has highlighting products
in it because it I do have like contour
products I used to use this non-stop
when I first bought it this Java shade
is literally life I freaking love it
it's amazing it's that perfect undertone
but I don't use this anymore at all
since I use since I started using the
other contour kit I'm going to show you
but it is still really good and I still
keep it because it's nice for travel
this is the Physicians Formula bronze
booster bronzer and I freaking love this
this is for medium to dark skin tones
and I like it because it's very soft
again really really pretty for a fair
skin this is what it looks like swatched
love it it's blends really nicely and
it's a matte but it has like a little
bit of a sheen to it so it's the kind of
matte that gives you a glow I have the
two bronzers girl lactic makes I feel
like that was a weird Descendants to say
this one is in Casablanca it's for the
deeper skin tones it's very it was like
a warmer color these bronzers are
incredible in terms of blending they are
the most pigmented bronzers I have and
it's hard to tell but they blend
flawlessly this one is like the warm one
and then I have this one in Cabo this
one is in Cabo can you tell it's the
cooler one and this is what it looks
like swatched it's so pigmented yet it
blends like a dream and I love the
undertone in this one because it's not
ashy but it's not like warm either of
course the swatches all start to look
the same eventually because they are all
bronzers but you know I can't have
enough this is the Jane bronzer in the
shade inspire I got mine at Ulta but
supposedly I don't know if Jane is sold
at Ulta anymore it is a really nice
bronzer because of the formula the color
is nice too it's a little bit warm
I love the formula like when you put
your finger in this you're like
whoa whoa that was weird but it almost
feels like a cream it's like amazing I
love it I have both of the makeup
forever proscope ting do sculpting duo's
sculpting this one in the shade zero one
and this one in the shade zero two
we'll mention these again when I talk
about all the highlighters I own so I'm
not going to touch base on the
highlighters but I actually really
really like these bronzers a lot of
people don't people just buy it for the
highlighters alone I'm wearing this
bronzer um kind of like on top of my
blush and it's the warmth that's on my
face and I like warm bronzers they
remind me a lot of Mac give me Sun which
I don't own and I've always wanted to
but I don't feel like I need to they're
warm but they're nice these are the
these are the little rock tantalizer
baked bronzers oh my god Porter stop it
she's gonna knock down my legs oh my god
you look like a different race I'm
really dark it's not normal you need to
put on SPF yeah well I work hard and so
they were going to play well I mean some
stuff okay oh yeah I have two of the
little rock tantalizer bronzers that
look just like the Milani one dupe alert
I know they have one other one which was
the original when they came out with
these are their two new ones in golden
glow and Mac tan and I love Matt Chen
these are baked so they just like I feel
they feel airbrushed on the skin matte
tan is a little bit warm but just a
little bit you can see that you can
contour with this perfectly but it's a
like multipurpose bronzer and then this
one in golden glow is perfect for deeper
skin don't deeper skin tones for that
like golden glow on the cheeks on me it
just it looks like a warm shimmery
bronzer but if you have very dark skin I
think this would be beautiful so I have
the NYX
contour palette and funny story I got
this in my NYX swag bag when I went to
I met LA in January but I lost it like I
don't know where it went so I went out
and bought another one um and I hadn't
even tried it when I lost it so I bought
it because people are raving about it
and I haven't tried it yet I just bought
it like I just bought this at Ulta this
is the first bronzer I ever purchased in
my life it's not the same one I ever
purchased this is definitely a
repurchase I love it so much this is the
Mac bronzing powder in refined golden
this is a permanent product they have I
love it there's little glitters in this
but on the skin it's just beautiful
honestly it's one of my top five
favorite bronzers and I don't really use
it on camera I don't know why but I
always use it
I just never use it on camera I'm gonna
start using it on camera more but this
is what it looks like it's just a
beautiful bronzer that's matte with a
little with a little golden sheen mixed
through it I don't know I look so tan
when I put this on my face like tan I'm
like oh girl I was at the beach all day
but I wasn't it's Mac's
refined golden okay this next product I
love it because it has a highlighter in
it as well but we're talking about the
wrong search today the highlight is my
favorite highlight but we're talking
about the bronzer today I will discuss
this more when I talk about my
highlights but this is the Charlotte
Tilbury fan film star bronze &amp;amp; Glow I
feel like I cannot speak today but this
is what it looks like it has a sculpt
side any highlights side but I love this
bronzer because you can use it to
contour your cheekbones because of the
undertone it's not like orange at all
this is it right here as you can see
it's not orange so it's really nice to
contour with but it's also beautiful to
warm up the face or like to bronze up
your face because it has a little bit of
a sheen as both of the products are
wonderful but the bronzer I really love
I have both of the Sonia Kashuk cream
bronzers and I really really love them
you can get Sonia Kashuk at Target
exclusively I believe but they are
seriously wonderful both of them this is
rich bronze which is more brown and less
warm less orange and this one is warm
tan it's a little bit more orange this
one is darker you know I'm going to
swatch them for you but they're both
cream but they are cream to powder like
if you're really scared of cream
products don't be because these blend
beautifully and they give you like a
powdery finish when you're done blending
it out I don't know how to explain it
but they are good sometimes I'm just in
the mood to cream contour and this is
what I go for on the top is rich bronze
and on the bottom is a warm tan so you
can see I don't know if you can tell
warm tan is just a little bit more
orange well which which which blondes is
a little bit more Brown this is the Too
Faced cocoa contour kit my favorite
contour kit ever I'm not gonna go in too
much detail because I'm gonna be talking
about it in my favorites video but it is
the best contouring kit I have ever
found B so I'm really like this brush
but besides this really crappy
highlighting shade it's called pop of
light but it's literally pure glitter
and I don't like to highlight with
glitter I like to highlight with like a
sheen as you can see I'm wearing the
Makeup Forever duo in 0/1 by the way but
I love it love it love it love it it has
been in the description box of like all
my recent videos if you guys have
noticed when I write what makeup I'm
wearing this medium Coco shade if they
had this sold separately I would buy it
I love it I think it's amazing because
this one warms up the skin so you can
see right here this one's for contouring
and this one's for warming up the face
it's seriously my favorite thing in the
entire world and it smells like cocoa I
love this this is the NYC Sun and bronze
bronzing powder NYC is like a couple of
dollars I have mine in Montauk bronze
and I swear it's one of my favorite
drugstore bronzers and it's like 2 bucks
it has like different colored strips the
one in the middle has kind of like a red
undertone these two are um like nice
little brown shades and then these are
more like grey and then when you mix it
all together I feel like it's such a
pretty matte bronzer and it's not too
too pigmented so it's it's like beginner
friendly I love it it's you know you can
build it up and I really like this you
guys have seen me
and a bunch of like tutorials I love it
it's a few dollars montauk bronze this
next bronzer I really love but I never
use it on camera because it's so
expensive this is the Chanel sole a
tenday chanel it is a cream bronzer very
similar to warm tan from Sonia Kashuk
but I like this one better for formula
it's super like creamy and it blends a
little bit better than that one does
then the warm tan does let me show you
this is the color right here it just
makes me feel like Jennifer Lopez oh
when I wear it the other one is better
for oily skin the Sonia Kashuk one
because it's kind of like a cream to
powder this one I mean this one gets
powdery too it doesn't stay creamy but
it's it's a little bit more glowy I
freaking love this I love it but it's
ridiculous it's Chanel that is why I
never use it on camera like ever but I
love it but I never show you guys
because I feel so bad just like my
Chanel primer the Blanc de Chanel I love
it but I never use it on camera because
I feel bad using it so Ben Nye powder
Rouge contour number one Ben Nye has
like a contour number two but I love
contour number one this is what it looks
like
I used this religiously especially when
I'm traveling because this pops right
out I'm not dried out some of
chippendale but this pops right out and
I take it with me like an easy palette
this is the best contouring powder it's
like that perfect gray I mean it's a
gray brown and I only use a little bit
right in the hollows of my cheek bones
because sometimes something that's too
grey looks like a little bit too ashy on
me but this gets it just right I love
this I got this at camera-ready
cosmetics calm a bronzer that's super
raved about and I rarely ever use it it
is the benefits hoola and mine is like
not even touch I don't know why because
it's so pretty
like it's a great contouring bronzer but
for some reason I just find myself
picking up other look like a look how
pretty that is that's great for contour
I don't I don't know why I thought that
smell good but I don't know why I don't
use it more often because I mean people
rave about this like it is loud to my
coca-cola
you know I spoke about this recently
a video this is the bodyshop honey
bronzer if you guys have fair skin
I swear pick this up it's perfect
because it blends so nicely like a feels
nice and it blends like a dream this is
what it looks like I mean can you even
see it probably not because it's perfect
for like fair skin it's amazing amazing
this is another cream product that I
forgot to say this is the Maybelline fit
me shine free foundation but I have mine
in the shade toffee caramel I actually
use this to contour like cream contour
like this is the color right here and it
blends out really nicely and it's that
cream to powder finish which I actually
really really like because it doesn't
feel sticky on my face I love it and
it's a stick so I just go through
through the through the Lulu Lulu and
then I blend it out with a stippling
brush okay we're almost done I'm sorry
this videos so long I don't know if I'm
going to continue this series because
these videos are going to be way too
long of course I have NARS Laguna it is
top 5 favorite bronzers this is probably
the only bronzer I showed that I've hit
pan on like in all of these bronzers
that is saying a lot one of the best
bronzers in the world
everything about this bronzer is perfect
there's no other way I could describe it
because I'm hey Beckett
this is what it looks like right here
it's it's weird to explain it's the
perfect undertone to contour with yet
there's like a golden sheen in it it
doesn't make it Orange so it's not a
warm orange bronzer but you could
contour and bronze the skin it's
fantastic this is the enter pronoun
blowtorch bronzer I got this in a
boxycharm honestly I never touched this
but I do like it in the summer whenever
I want to hit my cheeks with a little
bit of like a terracotta warmth and I
like it like in my crease I know that's
super weird but I use it like I'm like
oh you know what I want my cheeks to
look a little bit more warm like an
intense warmth and I just dab a little
bit on a stippling brush and I plop this
on my cheek okay so my last two bronzers
are from
bomb and I have the betty loumanizer it
could be a highlight for really deep
skin tones like darker women but to me
it's just a super super super shimmery
golden bronzer I don't anything like
this it's like gold a golden bronze can
you even tell okay let me try more
they're super pigmented - beau - but
it's like super shimmery and super gotta
see I like to add this like to the backs
of my cheeks back here to give like a
really beautiful goal glow sometimes
what is wrong with me I can't talk
sometimes I use this instead of like
blush and highlight I'll just pop this
on my cheeks especially in the
summertime girl I'll love you and then I
have the bombs like I said Bahama Mama
bronzer and this I use it when I have a
chat like when I'm darker because this
is hella Brown I remember you could tell
is brown this is it right here as you
can see is I got gray Brown perfect for
contouring for deeper skin tones and I
like it for my skin tone as well I just
use a light hand it just has such a
pretty undertone that I love it okay so
that completes this video this was the
first episode in my makeup stash series
and we spoke about bronzers next up
would be blushes let me know if this is
a series you want me to continue I know
