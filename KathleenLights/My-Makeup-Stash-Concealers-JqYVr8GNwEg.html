another makeup stache video I noticed in
my last one I got a lot of requests to
do my concealer collection so that is
what I am doing today for those of you
who wanted a facial mists like setting
sprays like mists facial mists makeup
mist video that is going to be my next
makeup stash video I will walk you
through my entire like face mist
collection settings phrasing all that
but today we're going to be looking at
my concealer collection I've kind of
feel like concealers are a little bit
boring since I can't really show you
swatches or anything like that because
they're all like my kind of skin tone or
a little bit lighter and stuff but it
was requested so let's just get on into
it so the first concealer I'm going to
share with you guys I'm just showing you
because I haven't tried it yet but I
want your opinion on it these are the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealers I
have mine in light golden and fair this
is what they look like I have heard a
lot of buzz about the amazing concealer
but I want to know your thoughts on it
like tell me what you use it for if
you've used it and is it good what is it
so the first one I want to share with
you guys is probably my newest drugstore
concealer this is the Maybelline
superstay better skin concealer it says
it's a concealer and a corrector and
it's oil-free this is supposedly
supposed to help your skin over time
like if you use it everyday over time
your skin is supposed to look better I
don't exactly know if that's true I'm
not sure if I believe that or not but
I've actually been really really liking
this concealer it doesn't have super
full coverage which it might throw some
people off it threw me off a little bit
at first but I really like this on an
everyday basis I don't wear makeup
everyday but when I just want something
to throw on and cover a little bit I
will use the better skin concealer
because it's very lightweight and it's
not heavy under my eyes it isn't really
crease if I set it and it's just
comfortable to wear so I have really
really been liking this one okay so now
let's talk about the best concealer I
have ever used in my entire freaking
life this is the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer I have mine in fair neutral
light warm
light neutral I will say that this is
the biggest pain in the ass when trying
to find your color I had to buy three
because I just didn't know so now I mix
and match them depending if I'm
self-tanning or not a lot of the times I
will mix light neutral and light warm
when I'm tan and then when I'm not tan
at all I will use very neutral but fair
and intro is like almost white so I will
say that the color selection sucks it
sucks so bad Urban Decay needs to do
something about it because like the
lightest one is too light but then the
one right after that is like dark is how
I I don't really love the color
selection but I look past it because the
formula is amazing it's just a doe foot
wand applicator type of thing so it's
really really easy to apply unlike that
for a long way or where it's a pump that
squirts out way too much I love this
it's my favorite because it's very
lightweight underneath the eyes yet it's
full coverage it looks flawless it looks
like second skin with full coverage
which is so rare because usually if
something is full coverage it's a little
bit heavy not this
I cannot cannot cannot recommend this
enough next up is the NYX HD concealer
now I keep this because I keep trying to
love it it is full coverage and it does
look really nice when you apply it but
it can make my under eyes look a little
bit cakey I have dry skin maybe this is
better for oily skin but if I use too
much it will get cakey I have to use a
lightweight more liquidy concealer on
top of this in order for it to blend out
because it's hard to blend out for me
like I'll apply underneath my eyes and
even though it's brightening and it's
nice and it looks well this it's so hard
for me to blend I still use it I still
use it and I can make it work using it
in conjunction with another concealer
okay next step it's the ever-so-popular
NARS radiant creamy concealer I have
mine in two shades I have one in custard
that if I am super self tan I could use
this under my eyes but typically when
I'm not self tan this matches my face
and then I have this one in vanilla
which is the one I always use underneath
my eyes I love this concealer because to
me it's multifunctional for example I
think it's really nice underneath the
eyes it is heavy and it is a little bit
thick I will say that but when you blend
it out especially with a Beauty Blender
it blends out really easily in it and
it's it looks fresh on the skin so I do
really like this underneath my eyes it
can crease a little bit so I really have
to set it immediately but if I do that I
like it I like it because it looks nice
but I also love it on blemishes that's
where I use custard a lot on my
blemishes because it is it's full
coverage on me and it just covers up my
blemishes really really easily so I love
the fact that it's it's good on
blemishes and it's good underneath my
eyes as well oh okay so this is my
favorite drugstore concealer ever and it
is the Maybelline fit me concealer and I
have four because I love this concealer
so much I have two in 15 Fair which I
use this underneath my eyes it's more of
a pinky kind of color so I really like
it underneath my eyes and then I have
this one in the shade 10 which like I
said for the NARS one if I am super tan
I can use this under eyes and most of
the time I use this on my face and then
I have this one in the shade deep
because I use it to contour this is all
around like one of the best concealers I
have ever used in my entire life is
super creamy a lot of people say it's a
dupe for the NARS one and I can see
where they get that but I feel like this
one is a little bit lighter it's a
little bit more lightweight it's not as
full coverage but it does have really
good coverage and this one's a little
bit dewier it has like a luminous not
like I don't know I explained it when I
put it on my entire face and I put it
underneath my eyes and stuff it looks
fresh and radiant like it almost looks
dewy and it's also another molt
functional concealer because I do use
ten light on blemishes and it covers
them up really well I've also used this
as foundation like all over my face I
just I love this concealer and it blends
like a dream which is why I like a deep
shade to contour with honestly if you
haven't tried the maybelline fitme
concealer you need to there's no glue
okay so this concealer is the coverfx
cream concealer I have mine in G light I
use this on blemishes like if I'm having
a very very blemishing month if it's
that time of the month or I use a
product that really broke me out or
something I will typically use the cover
FX concealer because it has really good
coverage it's full coverage it's too
thick front under-eye concealer I would
not recommend this underneath the eyes
but it's a nice blemish concealer and I
like to put this on top of my blemishes
because cover FX is one of those
companies it actually has pretty good
ingredients okay so I loved these for a
long time and I still love these these
are great concealers these are the LA
girl Pro conceal HD high definition
concealers these are just a few dollars
and they're so good they are so
comparable to the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer 's they have full coverage
really good full coverage really easy to
blend I have mine in almond I like this
one to contour with and then I have
creamy beige and natural I use these
both underneath my eyes natural I use it
because it's a little bit more pink so
when I have really dark bad under-eye
circles I use natural and if not I'll
use creamy beige because natural is a
little bit peachy err so it counteracts
like the Blues in my dark circles but
it's a great concealer I just don't use
it as much because the packaging is such
a V arch its first world problems I know
but for me it's really hard to squeeze
the product out of it I don't know if
I'm like a weakling and everybody else
can squeeze it with no problem but like
I'm like forcing it stuff so the only
negative I have to say about this is the
packaging but the price is so on point
that I look past it and it's still a
great concealer quality-wise and I think
it would be pretty good for blemishes as
well but it doesn't crease really better
in her eyes which is why I like it under
the eyes too this is the it cosmetics CC
eye
color correcting full-coverage cream
plus anti-aging hydrating serum SPF 50
that's an awful I like this concealer
but I never use it on camera because I
only use this on days where I'm not
really wearing makeup and I'm like oh
you know what let me put just a little
bit of something underneath my eyes and
I'll typically go for this especially if
I'm out in the Sun because this has SPF
50 which is amazing it's very very
lightweight like it's light coverage
that's what I meant to say it just evens
out the skin tone under there it covers
something but not too much and I really
like the fact that it comes with one of
these applicators like it's very very
cooling under the eyes this metal tip
makes it really fun to put on because
it's very cooling and then in the
mornings like wakes up your under eyes
and I really I like it it's not my
favorite but I love it on a day where I
don't really want to wear makeup this is
technically a concealer same yeah I'll
mention it haven't ended this is the
Maybelline Dream Lumi touch highlighting
concealer so this is basically just a
concealer to highlight underneath the
eyes there's not much coverage to this
whatsoever but it's my favorite
highlighting concealer from the
drugstore I know Lori o has one that's
very similar to this it's called like I
don't know what it's called but it's
very similar to this where guys like it
but I like this one so much more this
one has a little bit more coverage and
it's a little bit prettier I don't know
I love this this is the thing that I
love mixing with the NYX HD concealer
because it just makes this one easier to
blend this is the ever-so-popular a Mac
Pro Longwear concealer I have mine in
nw20 even though it looks brown it looks
darker than my face it's not that dark I
get mine in NW I like pinkier concealers
underneath my eyes because if I use a
concealer that's too yellow I look I
don't like it underneath my eyes it
makes me look a little bit sick and to
me like peachy or pinky concealers kind
of counteract my dark circles better
this is one of the best concealers I
have ever used it does not crease under
my eyes it's freaking amazing but the
packaging drives me nuts
this I love pumps on products like I
love pumps on foundations I love it but
the pump on this is so hard to work with
because it's not a very smooth
like okay it's your under-eyes you don't
need a full crazy pump of this you don't
need a full-on pump because it's so
pigmented and it goes such a long way
that you need very little but you cannot
pump half a pump of this because it's
too hard this fence is so much more
product than you actually need and you
end up throwing away a lot of it like
you end up just taking off most of it
with a makeup wipe and you're wasting
product so in turn you're wasting money
you know and I hate that it's glass I've
heard so many stories that it falls on
the floor a lot of people end up
breaking theirs I haven't yet knock on
wood Mira I'm a clumsy mess so this is
the Maybelline master concealed by face
studio camouflaging concealer I have
mine in fair this one is really light
for me right now but like in the fall
time it was a little bit perfect I think
I bought it like during the fall or like
winter it's kind of new because not this
is a great concealer I love that it's in
a squeezy tube I use this one underneath
my eyes as well and I love it because it
is full coverage and it and when you're
applying it for the first time you're
like oh this is really thick I don't
like it
but it blends really nicely it sets
nicely I do have to set it immediately
so it doesn't crease because I'm not it
will crease but I just love the coverage
it's such a good coverage but it doesn't
feel super thick in Katy so it's really
nice this is the makeup forever full
cover waterproof concealer this is a
great concealer you guys saw me use this
in milano if you did you guys saw me use
this for the first time in my full face
makeup forever tutorial I bought this
because I didn't have a makeup forever
concealer and I wanted to use one
underneath my eyes and this I have mine
in the shade for which online it's
called flesh this is a great concealer
but I would probably recommend it more
for blemishes if you have really um like
really bad breakouts I think this would
be amazing because girl I'm voice it is
so full coverage it says extreme
camouflage cream huh this is full
coverage my god this will cover any
breakout on your face
hundred percent and it's waterproof I
think it's a phenomenal blemish
concealer not so much for the eyes it's
a little thick but for your face it's
good this is a tried-and-true way I've
gone through multiples of these this is
the maybelline instant age rewind eraser
dark circles treatment concealer this is
the concealer have underneath my eyes
right now I feel like if you haven't
tried this go to the drugstore and try
it every time I haven't used it for
months and then I use it again I'm like
why do I stop using you you're amazing I
freaking love this this does cover your
dark circles pretty well so it has
really good coverage just sound like
super full full coverage but it has
great coverage and the lightest formula
ever it's like such a light formula it's
really amazing to highlight with it's
really amazing to cover your dark
circles it's just a fantastic concealers
I have mine in fair they also have a
yellow one and a pink one it's just
really really good okay so these are the
it cosmetics bye bye under eyes I have
the regular one and I have the
waterproof one I have mine in light and
neutral medium Katie from like lustre
luxe on YouTube loves it so I feel like
I want to give it another shot because
she loves it she really covers her
under-eye circles like really well I
mean it's it's good it's really full
coverage it does a full coverage
anti-aging concealer and it cosmetics
has really good ingredients so I'm going
to give this another shot it's super
like tacky and thick but I'm going to
try to work with it so yeah and the last
thing I will be talking about in this
video are my Mac prepping primes these
technically aren't concealers but I'm
going to mention them like boost and
radiant rose the alight boost is a
yellow one and the radiant Rose is a
pink one I like the pink one more when
I'm very very fair like one of my
natural skin tone like my milky skin
tone in the fall time because the pink
looks a little bit better underneath my
eyes but when I have a tan when I got
that olive skin going on I like using
the yellow one I have this underneath my
eyes today I don't really use it in
videos but I use it a lot on a
day-to-day basis to just highlight my
face so I'll just like
the drone program it that's why having
between my foreheads today forehead in
between my eyebrows today down my nose
on my chin it's a great highlighting pen
okay so those were all the concealers I
own I know a little bit excessive I'm a
little bit excessive

holy grove concealer if it's not any of
the ones I own like if you're watching
