episode of my makeup stash series today
we are dealing with drugstore blushes I
asked you guys in my last makeup stash
series what you wanted to see either
foundation or blushes and honestly I
don't know which one one which one one
so many people said foundations and so
many people said blushes I'm almost
positive that blushes one a little bit
but I mean Foundation was right there I
really couldn't decide so in two weeks I
will be doing foundations when I sat
down to film this video I was like wow
for someone who really doesn't care for
blush that much I have way too many
decided to split it up into two so today
we will be dealing with drugstore
blushes and then after my makeup stash
Foundation video I will do high-end
blushes after that just because I
haven't showed you all my blushes we'd
be here for 45 minutes yes
drugstore blush I like to stick to more
natural blushes I really love warm
peachy colors and stuff like that I like
warm colors you know this so now not all
my blushes are like cool toned which I
know sucks because I know a lot of
people love them but let's just talk
about my drugstore blushes let me move
my under bottle I'm not going to go in
any particular order at all I have three
mineral blushes from LA Colors LA Colors
is like a dirt cheap it's really really
inexpensive they are the same brand as
la girl but even cheaper than that and I
haven't used these in a while but you
guys know I use well I don't know if you
guys know but when I first got these I
used them all the time especially this
one right here it's my favorite so let
me show them to you and I will link all
of these blushes down below I will like
linked I want to start linking things
more I think they help better one of you
guys mentioned it like recently like hey
you should like link stuff and I'm like
you're right I should link stuff so
that's I'm going to do so this one is in
the shade natural and I love it it's a
very very natural everyday blush when I
first got this I reached for it more
than any other blush in my collection
it's just a soft really pretty natural
color these bushes do need to be built
up a little bit these mineral
just before the price I don't mind
working a little bit harder to build up
the color and actually sometimes I
prefer that because sometimes I don't
want to dip my brush into a blush and
then like oh mama oh ma you know
sometimes I like oh I like the building
process so I can appreciate that so this
one is natural I like saying it like
that this one is another favorite of
mine and I recommend this for you if you
are very very fair this one is called
blushing it's a really pretty soft it's
very similar to natural but a little bit
softer a little bit more pinky neutral I
don't know if you can tell but it's
beautiful if you're very very fair
sometimes if you're very fair it's hard
to find a blush that doesn't look like
on you and I really love this one and
then the last one I own and love this
one is called sheer bliss it's a
beautiful pink and while the other two
are matte this one has a little bit of a
sheen to it it's not super noticeable
it's not crazy but it does look glowy on
the skin like almost glowy I don't know
it's like a satin finish but with the
shininess to it I don't know it's really
really gorgeous it's a little bit more
pigmented than those and it stands out
more okay let's talk Revlon I only have
one Revlon blush I had two but the other
one fell and shattered into a thousand
million pieces so I threw it away this
is the Revlon powder blush in this
in the shade naughty nude this is what
it looks like I love this I love this
looks this looks great with any makeup
look this pairs perfectly with any
makeup look even if you're just wearing
mascara or a super deep intense smoky
eye this one is a nice nude it's that's
exactly what it is it's a nude pink it's
beautiful it goes well it's like
everything I just said that but let's
talk about Milani the best blush is at
the drugstore in my humble opinion I
really don't think that any other blush
makes me feel the way that these feel
and they are the baked blushes by Milani
these are the best the best if you
haven't tried the Milani baked blush
--is why why I'm going to show you my
absolute favorite one I'm not going
this is probably my favorite drugstore
blush ever this is in the shade luminoso
if you watch youtube videos that you
would know that everybody loves it but
everybody loves it for a reason it's the
blush I'm wearing on my cheeks right now
I added very a little bit I wanted it to
be more bronzer my makeup look today but
I do have luminoso on my face it gives a
beautiful glow to the skin it's a peachy
blush very peachy and it looks good on a
lot of different skin tones especially
more like medium to fair it's one of
those blushes that I feel like I can
wear very very very very minimal make-up
barely any bronzer and then throw this
on my cheeks and I just look fresh and
awake and put together I love it and I
just love the sheen in it you almost
don't even have to put on highlight I
mean I did today I'm excessive I really
really love rose de Oro I love this one
this one is a little bit more bronzy ish
see this one is Luminoso and this one
kind of gives you that luminoso feel
just a few shades darker this one has
more gold to it it definitely has like
gold shimmers all throughout it but it
looks stunning on the face especially in
the summertime um this is pretty
pigmented so I just like to dust it
really lightly on my cheeks like in the
summer and it just sold out lovely and
then this one I have which is a cool
tone blush but it's surprisingly
beautiful this one is in the shade daily
Co so pink it's beautiful it's like a
cool tone almost has a purple undertone
but it looks so pretty when you're doing
like a cool tone look just to throw this
on your cheeks you can build this up
it's one of those blushes that doesn't
look crazy it looks crazy in the pan and
even though it is pigmented you could
blend it really well so even if you put
on your cheeks in your life oh that's
pink you could take your time and blend
it and it doesn't look splotchy or
uneven that's what I love about this
blush you could really blend it out and
make it look super natural this is
another blush that I haven't actually
talked about this on my channel because
I got it like two months ago one day
when I was at sadhana's alright with my
grandmother or no
now make sure we're was but this is a
Jordanna blush in the shade sandalwood
this is another great one for a very
very very pale or very I hate the word
pale fair girls a beautiful everyday
pink so so pretty and these blushes are
like two dollars I want to say and
they're very pigmented I could only
really wear this when I'm my natural
skin color not when I'm like tan because
it is a little bit of like a whitish
pink it's great like I said great for
fair-skinned blushes for being so
inexpensive they're actually pretty good
so let's talk about NYX because I have a
million NYX blushes I have these new
ones that NYX came up with recently not
like super recently but I got them at
the NYX event this one is probably my
favorite wait is it
yeah this one's my favorite one out of
the whole HD line these are called I'm
sorry didn't say that the NYX HD
delicious this one is in the shade soft
spoken
it's these are all looking very similar
aren't they on camera for some reason
it's not picking up how peachy is it's a
very peachy blush like that's that's
what it is it's peach like a straight-up
matte peach blush which I love I love
peach I love warm colors peach just
looks so pretty with like a deep bronze
e smoky I love me some beige this one is
gorgeous too this one's called Beach
babe and it looks like a bronzer in the
pan but it's not like when you go to
blend it out onto your skin it has a
beautiful golden Sheen like a golden
shimmer it's amazing
/ I think the name is perfect beach babe
because it's like a nice beachy look to
your face perfect for the summer because
the golden sheen is like intense and
beautiful really like this one actually
and then this one is for everyone who
just likes one of those nude blushes
that's not - peach not too pink not too
Brown it's just a perfect nude this one
is called nude tude
and then I have three of their like
original powder blushes these are just
like their regular powder ones I have
this one which I've used in a video last
summer and this one is called cinnamon
and this one is scary like like this
that is scariest straight-up
coral/orange
but I love it I really really love it I
mean you need like barely barely any
product to put it on your face because
it can get really scary really fast but
I think this is the kind of blush that
would work for so many different skin
tones I think that deep skin tones can
wear this and it'll look nice and
natural but for someone like with my
skin tone you really really have to use
a very light hand but when you do it
kind of looks like I'm not excited it
looks like naturally flushed cheeks like
you've been in the Sun it's so pretty
and then I have this one this one was my
favorite for so long if you are like an
OG subscriber I used to wear this
non-stop actually got this in an Ipsy
bag this is in the shade mob and it's a
really pretty natural modish pink really
pretty goes well with everything and
then this one is beautiful definitely
like one of my top 5 favorite drugstore
blushes this one's called terra cotta i
like to call it the jojoba it's a golden
shimmery peachy just a sheen it's a
golden sheen and it's beautiful this is
also a super amazingly gorgeous
eyeshadow by the way okay so two more
next blushes they were in recent hauls
these are their NYX baked blushes these
are illuminators and bronzers but I have
this one in the shade sugar mama
and then this one in the shade chiffon
sugar mama is like like it's a really
pretty blush topper because to me this
is more like a highlight like a peachy
highlight but this looks nice on top of
blushes and then this one is really
pretty like as a mob shimmery blush and
chiffon they're not my favorite formulas
from NYX but they are really pretty I
don't really love the packaging they're
a little bulky a blush that I found that
is really inexpensive that was also
featured in that whole
I posted my most recent one and I loved
it and I didn't think I would this is
the essence silky touch blush I want to
try more in this line this is in the
shade baby doc oh my gosh this blush is
beautiful
it looks like just a regular blush in
the pan but when you put it on your face
your face almost glows it does have a
sheen to it which I love it has a
beautiful Sheen like this makes your
cheeks glow but not like in a crazy
shimmery way there's no like shimmers or
glitter it's just a pink with a sheen
it's gorgeous these are like two dollars
if you haven't tried baby doll I highly
recommend cuz he's good okay so now I'm
going to talk about elf blushes blushes
I love elf blushes actually now I am NOT
a fan of the elf studio blushes the ones
that look like the NARS packaging not a
fan I've always found a lot of people
like them but I've always found them to
be too chalky and too powdery and they
just I don't like them but these press
mineral blushes are my favorite elf
blushes I love them these are also I
would say like top 5 blushes in my
drugstore blush collection I love them
if you haven't tried the pressed mineral
blushes from ELF
do so there are a few dollars they're
amazing so I have two here the other two
are really beautiful too but but they're
better for deeper skin tones I love this
one the most this one is in the shade
sweet retreat all these blushes are
looking really similar and it's making
me sweaty it's a really pretty soft pink
I used this in a recent like drugstore
get ready with me it is beautiful with
like a chocolaty eye makeup look it's
beautiful it's not too cool it's not too
warm it's a just perfect light pink
blush and it blends like a dream these
do not look talkie they do not like skip
on your face I don't know what it is but
this formula feels like butter they feel
like butter they are so so good and then
this one is beautiful too if you want
like a more peachy Coral um cheek this
one is called Cabo Cabana it's a coral
like a really light coral really
beautiful this one does have little
flecks of glitters in it but I mean they
don't really
show them which on your skin and it's
nothing to like worry about it's a
really nice blush then I have this elf
blush palette this one is actually in
the shade light they have another one
either in like medium or deep or
something I'm not sure but this is the
light blush palette if I could open it
this is what it looks like this is so
amazing to travel with and actually
don't be fooled this one right here
these pop out by the way please pop out
which is amazing because you can buy
both the light and the dark one and
customize it which is what I did I
customize it because this blush is
actually in the dark one it's in the
dark palette and I didn't like the blush
that was here so I just took that one
out and put this one in from the dark
palette like I just said so I love that
they're interchangeable because say you
have one that you Rin love you love the
whole palette but say you have one that
you really love and you hit pan on it I
mean you could just replace it I love it
it's only a few dollars and you get a
decent amount of looks this one's like a
perfect orange II like nude one this is
a more mom this one's hat it's a pink
but with like a reddish undertone and
this is a really pretty cool tone pink
this is great because it has a big
mirror and you could travel with this
and they actually blend really nicely
and they're pretty good so I really like
this Hellenic mint and then these two
blushes from ELF are new releases these
are from the beautifully bear collection
I was going to do a whole video on it
but I didn't because I didn't end up
liking the mascara um but if you want me
to review where is it if you want me to
review the elf foundation serum let me
know in the comments below and I will
review it for you
it came with this this brush is actually
in the beautifully beautifully bear
collection and it's fabulous if you
don't have this brush brush can I speak
today oh my god it's the elf blending
brush if you don't have it get it anyway
so these are the two blushes that came
in the collection and while I absolutely
love one I don't love the other so this
is the one that I don't like so much and
it's not because I don't like the color
this is called rose royalty it kind of
feels a little bit waxy and it just
doesn't feel the same way this one does
and you would think there would be the
same formula because you know but it's
not this one feels a little bit waxy err
and a little bit harder to apply a
little bit harder to blend so I
am NOT a fan of rose royalty but then
this one has a really creamy texture
this one is in the shade peach
perfection and it's beautiful it's a
creep by the way these are cream blushes
this one feels completely different
easier to apply it's easier to blend
it's a beautiful peach and if you're
into cream blushes I don't know if you
guys have noticed I don't have crema
blushes from the drugstore they're just
to me harder to come across at the
drugstore but this one is really pretty
blends easily and it's a nice flush of
like peach enos to the cheeks I like it
a lot okay so that was everything from
elf let's keep it moving okay so I have
four more products to share with you
this videos already like a million years
long can you imagine if I would have
added high-end blushes we've been here
all day this is the L'Oreal True Match
blush in the shade um baby blossom I
love this blush and I don't really use
it that much but it's a beautiful cool
toned baby pink sometimes sometimes I
really do I put on my makeup and I'm
like wow this would look really pretty
with a cool tone like light pink and I'd
go for this what's great about these
blushes or these powders because they
have a couple blushes in the range is
that they're so easy to blend they are
the you know True Match super blendable
powders so it makes sense oh I forgot to
mention this legend we were talking
about Milani
well I'll talk about it now so I got
this blush mainly for the packaging
because it's beautiful it's their powder
blush in the shade romantic rose it's
literally a rose and it's gorgeous I
don't love roses but it's gorgeous it's
a really pretty mom pink and it's
beautiful the formula is not as good as
these baked ones it's not but it's still
a really pretty color I mean you could
wear it it's a blush it's nice in these
last two products I have they're kind of
like blushes and highlighters in one but
I wanted to mention them because I use
them as blushes especially this one
these are the Maybelline master
highlights highlighting blushes this one
you've seen me back in the day I use
this all the time this one is in the
shade nude it's a really pretty like
cool tone bronzy pink blush on anybody
deeper than my skin tone this would
definitely 100
and to be a highlight like just a
straight-up pinky highlight but I like
to use this as like a blush topper
whenever I'm wearing like a matte blush
and I'm like no I need a little bit more
I grab this and I add it I look really
pretty pinky sheen to my face and then
this one is called coral it's so me look
at it it's so mean
so me it's a beautiful Orange II Coralie
blush it's gorgeous
this one is a little bit deeper like I
could definitely wear this is just a
blush alone it's not a highlight on me
it's too dark to be a highlight but it's
a beautiful glowy blush okay guys so
