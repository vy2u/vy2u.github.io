stash video in my makeup stash series
and today I'm going to be sharing with
you my entire eyes shadow palette
collection this video is going to be
seven hours long I just know it the way
that I broke this down I'm not going to
be talking about quads or any anything
like that I'm gonna be talking about
palettes to have over like seven
eyeshadows I consider that a palette I'm
not going to be sharing with you guys my
Z palette because I have a bunch of
single eyeshadows and those so they're
technically not palettes I mean they are
their Z palettes but they're just full
of like makeup geek and Mac and makeup
forever and all that stuff I'm gonna be
specifically talking about palettes sold
as a pelham I'm just gonna go ahead and
get started because I have so many and
honestly guys before I get the comments
like nobody needs that many palettes I
know nobody needs that many pallets I
think you're good with like a colorful
one and then a neutral one and you're
good to go that's those are the only
shadows you'll ever need but with what I
do I do YouTube for a living and I'm
always buying new palettes I get sent
new palettes things like that because
I'm constantly looking at new things and
trying out new things to share with you
guys to recommend to you guys because
trust me if I didn't have a YouTube
channel I wouldn't I would give half of
more than half of these away to friends
and family and just keep the bare
necessities okay in no particular order
I'm gonna talk about the naked palettes
first I have the Naked basics this is
the original one I don't have Naked
basics too because I do not like it
personally but I don't I haven't used
this ballot in a hot minute and I should
because it does have your nice basic
neutrals it has six eyeshadows it's
great for on-the-go
but I do have a couple of other neutral
matte shadows that I like more than this
one I might just go ahead and give this
one away to my sister who knows I like
it though I just don't use it as much
and then I have these three right here I
have the original Naked palette I have
the Naked 3 and I have the naked smoky I
used to have the Naked 2 palette but I
gave it away to a friend because I never
ever touched it it's my least favorite
Naked palette out of all four of them
this one being my top dog isn't it weird
the only letter that's faded is the K
weird this is my second favorite palette
of all time they feel like you cannot go
wrong with the original especially if
you like warm eyeshadows
it's very bronzy very chocolatey the
quality is amazing and I love it I also
really really enjoy the naked 3 I was so
happy when they came out with a rosy
tone palette they have really romantic
shades and I wear these colors like
during February like Valentine's Day or
if I want like a romantic look I really
love this palette hate the packaging I
like I like this packaging I don't
nobody does but I do and then I have the
naked smoky which is their newest one I
haven't really dope into this one quite
as much as I want to I have to play with
it a little bit more but I like it
because it has nice sultry smoky colors
this is the tart tart slit palette from
the brand tart obviously it's full of
matte eyeshadows only it has like a roll
of rosy colors a row of purple and then
a row of like cool tone colors right
here so it is very versatile I really
really like it I don't use as much as I
should but I love how they have cooler
toned eyeshadows because I'm the type of
person that goes for warmer eyeshadows
so it's nice to have something like this
that I could dig into I have two of the
elf prism eyeshadows these are amazing
eye shadows from the drugstore I mean
amazing palettes prism eyeshadow
palettes I have this one in the shade
smoked and I want to do a tutorial using
one of these colors because they're
stunning they're very very pigmented I
highly recommend these elf prism
eyeshadow palettes but my favorite one
is this one in the shade naked I've done
a tutorial using this this has the most
metallic most amazing frosty shimmery
not frosty more metallic but the best
chocolatey colors I've ever seen it's
crazy you would think they were like
makeup forever I chose they're that good
I have four of these mini Too Faced
palettes this is in the much older
packaging I'm not exactly sure if you
can still get this palette but I keep it
because when I bought it it was my
all-time favorite palette like
I was using this palette on the daily
this is what it looks like it's called
the Too Faced natural at night palette
I'm so glad they changed the packaging
because I don't like this cardboard but
it has the most amazing warm like Olive
V and chocolaty and bronzy smokey eyes
so I'm really into those colors as you
can tell but I keep it because this is
my favorite olive green eyeshadow in the
world and I wish they sold it separately
because I love it actually did a
tutorial like a year and a half ago
using the eyeshadow but I still enjoy
this palette from time to time
it's very smoky nighttime appropriate
and then I have these three right here
this one is not my favorite favorite but
it's still really good this is the Too
Faced sugar pop palette it's full of
really nice colors I keep it because I
love blackberry I love sugared violet
and this melted milk ball is really nice
too so whenever I want like pops of
color like this I could reach for this
so that is the sugar pop very good
quality I love Too Faced shadows they're
amazing and then I have this one this is
the natural eyes and this one is
gorgeous I highly recommend the natural
eyes palette along with this one this is
the natural matte palette I'm showing
you both of them because there are eyes
shadow repeats in this one they have
very similar eyes shadows this one is
just all matte while this one has a few
shimmer shades so I would go for this
one if you are into both matte and
shimmer this naturalize palette was my
obsession when I got it it's awesome I'm
sorry that I'm not watching these and
I'm not going through all of them but we
would be here for days date I tell you
days this is the Saucebox palette and
it's in collaboration with battle ash so
is there a battle ash palette I still
haven't used this I hauled this when I
went to fame expand I still have not
used it although this first row is like
screaming my name I don't know why I
haven't used it yet and this
amazing oh my gosh look at that curlier
well these soft Spock's eyeshadows are
very good quality but this palette cost
me an arm and a leg man and this was a
very expensive palette you do get really
gigantic eyeshadows so you probably
won't hit pan on this very very very
very long time so I mean I understand
this is the Sigma creme doctoral eight
if you guys have been watching my
channel since the beginning then you
have seen this before I'm talking like
the beginning I purchased this palette
because I didn't have any color like any
eyeshadows that look like this they're
very colorful but they're very pastel II
it was macaroon inspired so I loved this
they're actually really good quality um
they're very very good quality they're
just very soft shadows and the only
reason why I keep it is because it's a
nice limited edition palette and if this
was the first eyeshadow palette that I
reviewed on my channel like I bought it
for my channel I was telling Danny I'm
like I really want to buy that palette I
really really want to do a video on it
so he got it for me so it's like
sentimental but I like using this for
Easter or around that time I actually
used this purple one mixed with this
pink one on Mother's Day it looked
really nice Mother's Day of last year
not this Mother's Day that past the one
before that I have four little rock
palettes so I have the two lorac Pro
palette this is the original and this is
the second one I never use these on my
channel I you probably like a girl you
never use any of these things but I
don't know why the original is probably
my favorite one just because I mean
these are colors that I wear all the
time
this gold shade is so good they're very
buttery I highly recommend the pro
palettes they're just so smooth they're
easy to blend they're really really
really good quality and good for the
price and then I have the second one and
I just don't use this one I think I
might give this one to my sister I don't
know I really love the shade Rose Day
it's stunning
but I think I might pass this along this
isn't like a decoder video but I might
just give this to my sister
cuz I don't really use it that much I
much prefer the original actually when I
first got this I loved it I even thought
I loved it more than this one but then I
found myself going back to this one so
and then the other two lorac palettes
that I actually prefer over the pro
palette I think that everyone loves the
pro palettes everyone says that those
are the best palettes from lorac but I
disagree this is just my humble opinion
I like the unzipped palette more they
aren't as like breakable like you put
your brush into the lorac Pro palette
and because the eyeshadows are so soft
like you put your brush in and eyeshadow
goes everywhere like explodes and these
don't do that but they do have amazing
pigmentation so this is the original
unzipped and I use this a ton just not
on my video in my videos and I don't
know why but these are very rosy colors
but it's different from The Naked 3
palette because the Naked 3 palette has
like purpley rosy colors and this has
like bronze rosy colors so I prefer
these kinds of shades I'm not gonna lie
this color sucks
this one right here called undiscovered
it's just chunky and glittery and barely
has pigmentation and I feel the same way
about unreal but these two are the only
ones I don't like I love every other
eyeshadow but my all-time favorite
unzipped is the unzipped gold this is
what it looks like it's so amazing and I
know it just seems basic and bland but
look at this eyeshadow I mean this
eyeshadow alone is the reason why I
bought it this eyeshadow alone and it's
called Unleashed yep I bought it for one
eyeshadow this is another elf palette
and they came out with a ton of these
kinds of palettes that look like this
they're different from the prism
palettes they look just like this and
this is the only one I liked I didn't
like any of the other ones this one is
their matte one it's called mad format
and I highly recommend it even though I
didn't like the other ones this one is
so good it has really great pigmentation
you get a bunch of different matte
shades earth tones you have a really
good variety and it's the perfect like
companion palette or you can go into a
palette full of shimmer
like a shimmery look and if you need any
matte color anything you can jump into
this palette and use this this is a very
very new palette and I haven't used it
yet because I pretty much just got it
this is the Stardust palette by Too
Faced it was their collaboration with
Vegas nay and I love two-faced
eyeshadows so I know that these are good
this color right here called showgirl I
made this little corner right here you
know these reds and these warm Browns
amazing really good quality the Urban
Decay electric palette I actually
featured this in my favorite palettes of
2014 this was featured this is the best
color for eyeshadow palette in the world
I bought this fell in love with this
amazing these eyeshadows are amazing and
obviously this isn't the kind of palette
that you wear on a daily basis but it is
one of my top five favorite palettes
because the quality is amazing I've done
a few tutorials using this when I first
bought it it's just so freakin good
oh I almost broke that so two pilots
from anastacio and these are both
palettes that I highly recommend if you
can get your hands on them get them
because they like to come out with
pellets and then take them away from us
but these are the Anastasio palettes
this one is the artist palette and this
is the shadow Couture palette this one I
bought and this one was sent to me but I
love this palette you get a ton of
different colors and some neutrals and
this is only $30 that's what I really
love about Anastasio palettes even
though they're single eyeshadows are
kind of pricey when you buy her her
palette they're 30 bucks you get a brush
and you get well I shadows for 30 bucks
I think it's a great deal but this one
is my favorite this is the world
traveler palette shadow contour palette
whatever has like two names you get pops
of color here in there but it's a very
warm delicious palette for $30 and I
highly recommend the this palette a lot
this is the wet and wild comfort comfort
comfort zone palette it's my favorite
palette from Wet n Wild because to me it
has the most pigmented the most
high-quality the most amazing shadows in
the end
our world I love the greens in this
palette I did a tutorial using the
greens and these chocolatey colors are
nice the only thing that sucks is that
they're all shimmery shades but that's
when you can grab your elf mad format
that I can't find and you can use it in
companion like they work really well
together I love this palette this is my
all-time favorite palette if all of my
palettes disappeared except one this is
the one I would want to keep and it is
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette I
also featured this in my best palettes
of 2014 or but this to me is the best
palette in the world I take it with me
whenever I travel this is my traveling
buddy even though I have the old
packaging that's thicker the new
packaging is a lot slimmer which I want
but I already have this one so I love it
I love both highlight shades I love
every shade the only I don't like
is this one in the corner of this green
it comes off like super like barely
green I don't like it but all the other
ones amazing quality and it smells like
vanilla cocoa I love it best palette in
the world
I also have a ton of these palettes by
morphe and I quickly wanted to mention
these because even though I have so many
of these morphe pallets these three are
the best ones and I just wanted to share
them with you this is the 35 I highly
recommend each and every one of these
three I have like 10 but these three are
the best and worth your money I mean all
morphe palette are worth your money
because you get like a million
eyeshadows and it's really cheap but
these are so worth your money this one
is the 35 t palette full of beautiful
malls beautiful Browns really romantic
nice and rosy I love it few Purple's
here and there I love this one I have a
tutorial using this one and then this is
the 35o palette which this is the one
I'm wearing on my eyes today just like
two colors but I love this if you're a
warm girl if you're an orange girl this
will be your friend I love love love it
very good quality amazing look at this
look look just look just look
oh and then this is the 35 D palette I
also have a tutorial using this one I
used the blues really dark smoky colors
if you are into like really dark amazing
colors I highly recommend this one I
have a 10% off coupon code it's
kathleenlights and you save 10% 10% off
at morphe I have the Sonia Kashuk eye on
neutral matte palette I love this it's
my favorite matte palette from the
drugstore hands-down my favorite the
only color I don't like is this white
one because there's no pigmentation at
all but all the other ones very buttery
very pigmented I'm always using this you
guys see this a lot it's well loved this
is my Holy Grail matte eyeshadow palette
I have a bunch of palettes that have
strictly matte shadows this is my
favorite one this is the it cosmetics
naturally pretty palette this is what it
looks like I love it because it has a
ton of warm colors smoky colors I have a
tutorial using the purple ones I have a
tutorial using this color called mocha
it's my favorite eyeshadow in this
palette it's like an olive green grey
sunset and sunrise oranges they just
these are amazing the reason why I love
this palette this matte palette more
than any of my other ones is because
they're almost a satin finish not a flat
matte so they're not chalky they're not
patchy they're not powdery they're
almost creamy and that's really hard to
come across when they're matte shades if
you guys haven't tried the naturally
pretty profit the original you need to
you will never look at other matte
shadows the same again and then I have
this one that they just came out with
they just sent me this this is the it
cosmetics naturally pretty romantic
palette now I already know that I'm not
going to love this one as much as the
original but it's still stunning
nonetheless the same buttery quality
amazing they're on Matt this is just a
lot softer a little bit more pastels a
little bit like a like a light green and
purples and a little bit softer we're
almost done I just have three more to
share with you guys this is the Kat Von
D shade shade + light eye palette
another matte palette that I really
really like but it's not my all-time
favorite the pick
is so intense on this that you have to
be really really careful it can get
really heavy really quickly so it's not
a look that you can go into like a very
soft because it won't be very soft it's
gonna be bold and it's going to be
intense which I do like about this so I
guess the Cappadocia and light palette
and then I have the two pallets by the
balm the nude the nude tude and the nude
dude this is the original the first one
they came out with I was obsessed with
this when I first got it I used it all
the time I haven't used in a long time
and I think I'm going to give this away
to a friend of mine because I haven't
used it in so long and then I have the
nude dude which is their newer one and I
actually like more than the original
this actually has the guys on it this
one has the girls this one has the guys
I just like this color selection more
than this one so really really good
quality I love the balm and they're
always going on sale they do like flash
sales for 50% off all time okay guys so
that completes this makeup stash video I
hope it wasn't too long I tried to go
through each palette really really
quickly because I have so many leave me
requests down below what you want future
makeup stash videos to be about and I
will definitely write them down thank
you guys so much for watching please

will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
