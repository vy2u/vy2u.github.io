video in my makeup stash series today's
video is a serious hoarder
I'm a serious primer hoarder we were
talking about face primers and recently
for some crazy reason face primers have
taken over my life and I want to try
every single face primer out there
it's insane I've become obsessed and
honestly I don't even think you need
face primer I think that you can put on
a moisturizer and that will cling onto
your makeup and that will serve as a
primer and you're good to go but I do
recommend you putting on any base like
put on something put on moisturizer put
on something I mean you don't have to
but your makeup does cling onto those
things better and they sit better on the
skin when you have something underneath
whether that be a primer or even a
moisturizer and I have been primer
obsessed take this video with a grain of
salt I know this is ridiculous have
you're gonna it's ridiculous I think
you're good with just one primer if you
have a problem with your makeup lasting
all day I also do recommend a primer
because some are made to make your
makeup last so I'm gonna go ahead and
get started and unfortunately I don't
have a lot of drugstore primers I
haven't found amazing primers at the
drugstore I think that the drugs or
exceeds foundations and other face
products but I feel like they kind of
lack a little bit in the primer category
so I'm so sorry that 90% of these are
high-end I really am sorry really
quickly though before I get started I do
want to say that I have all of the make
up forevers step one equalizers I have
all of them but I have them displayed in
my cat's corner just know that they are
really amazing at priming your face
making your makeup lasts a long time my
favorite one is the hydrating one the
redness reducing one because it
literally reduces your redness and the
smoothing one those three I recommend I
could do without the rest of them but
they are really good okay so these are
the Laura Mercier foundation primers
these are one of my favorite primers
hands down I find that the Laura Mercier
ones really really make my makeup last
longer and just make my skin look nice
these don't fill in your pores
these aren't silicone base this one is
actually the radiance bronze and this
one is the radiance
this one in the summertime it has a
bronze color to it and this radiant one
is probably my favorite one out of all
of them that gives me like a radiant
glow I have a lot of glowy primers this
one is probably my favorite one it has
like a champagne color and just makes my
skin feel so nice it doesn't break me
out and I iced up myself
it really does prolong the wear of my
makeup this is the Too Faced hangover RX
it is their replenishing face primer
this has coconut water
electrolytes probiotics it's silicone
free you're gonna notice in this video
that I do not like those kind of really
silicone based primers the only one I
truly truly truly love what I love one
from the drugstore but the only one I
truly love is the makeup forever skin
equalizer and smoothing that's the only
one anyway I love this one because it
feels like a moisturizer it honestly
feels like I'm putting on moisturizer it
makes my skin feel really really soft
and it smells like coconuts it's
fantastic I love this primer this is the
pore minimizing primer I was talking
about that actually like this is the
maybelline baby skin instant pore eraser
I find that it does erase my pores but I
like this one because it doesn't dry out
my skin some poor minimizer's make my
skin feel really like texturing and
tacky this one doesn't do that it has a
nice slip to it so foundations go on
really nicely on top makes your skin
like a slippy which may turn people off
but I really like it because makeup lies
nicely on top of it this is the
hourglass number 28 primer serum I
refuse to buy the full size cuz it's
ridiculous how expensive it is this is
my dream when my skin is doing really
bad I have days where my skin is so dry
when my face is extra dry putting this
on my face is like my skin drinking a
glass of water it is in oily primer so
you want to stay far away from this if
you have normal to oily skin a little
goes a very long way like I said it's
like serum E so you have to be careful
but it makes my skin plump and so so so
hydrated this is the bare minerals prime
time BB primer cream I have mine in
light I love this I don't use it
much on camera but I think that this
makes like blurs my pores I don't know
if I'm crazy but I feel like this blurs
my pores makes my makeup last all day
and it gives color to my face because it
is the BB crimer crimer BB primer this
is also great because it has an SPF of
30 and not a lot of primers that have
SPF if you think about it so you could
even wear this completely on its own
this is the Marc Jacobs invisible
undercover perfecting coconut face
primer honestly I bought this because it
said it had coconut in it it was a
coconut face primer and I regret buying
this to be completely honest with you
because this is so much better and
cheaper so I mean not that this is bad
I'm still gonna use it because I lost my
receipt I'm still gonna use it I'm gonna
use it up I'm gonna put it on my face
but I mean it's hydrating it's
moisturizing it does it hydrates my face
but I wasn't wowed at all I feel like
the two-faced one is better this is the
NYX angel veil skin perfecting primer I
love this primer it oil free I find that
my makeup lasts a really long time when
I use this and it gives me like a very
smooth canvas this comes out white and
then when you blend it in the white it
doesn't have a white cast it goes away
but it feels like a moisturizer but like
a very like smoothing well I don't know
how to explain it it's amazing and it's
a drugstore primer and this is probably
the best drugstore primer I have come
across it's fantastic I highly recommend
it it makes my makeup last and that is
actually a dupe for this guy right here
so I so regret buying this because this
is a dupe and so much cheaper this is
the hourglass veil mineral primer this
is oil free it pretty much does the
exact same thing as the next one only
this one makes my makeup last a little
bit longer than the next one does if I'm
gonna be honest but if you have always
wanted to try this try the NYX one first
so you can save some money and if you
liked the next one go from there it's
great but it's so pricy I
I have two from Joey that I really
really love I have the anti-aging
moisture primer it has hyaluronic
antioxidant treatment with peptides
hypoallergenic paraben free silicone
free this is great for my sensitive skin
it doesn't irritate my skin and it's
moisturizing my face in a really nice
way so it makes me feel really nicely
hydrated I love this it's fragrance free
as well which I appreciate I love that
primer and I also really like this one
I'm only use it twice but this is the
anti blemish matte primer it has
salicylic acid acne treatment in it and
it says it's non-drying non irritation
and a pore refiner oil-free
hypoallergenic paraben free caravan
paraben free silicone free I usually
stay away from primers that claim to be
matte since my skin is dry but this one
doesn't dry out my skin sometimes I have
a foundation that's a little bit too
luminous if that's even possible
or sometimes I have a foundation that
doesn't last as long and gets oily
really fast so I will use this
underneath because it doesn't dry out my
skin and it does keep me matte for the
most part I really really love it this
is the l'oreal of magic lumi light
infusing primer i have purchased like a
million of these I love this for really
intense icy glow like it's white it's a
very very white primer and it looks
pearly but it just I love how it makes
my skin look it's like my face looks wet
so any foundation I put on top looks
nice and dewy I love it I don't find
that it prolongs my makeup but it makes
me nice and dewy and I like that which
this is also kind of a dupe for this
only I like this one because I find that
this one almost makes my skin better if
that's even possible this is the Mac
strobe cream it's pretty much the same
thing it's a pearly white kind of
consistency but this one hydrates my
skin a little bit better this one is a
little bit oilier this one's more like a
cream I don't know I'm not making any
sense but I really love the Mac strobe
cream for different reasons that I like
the Lummi even though they're so very
similar and then let's talk about
another product that I don't know
this is the Chanel LeBlanc de Chanel a
Chanel primer base Universal this is a
great primer I'm not gonna lie it makes
my skin look so hydrating my foundation
looks beautiful on top of it it's worth
how much I spent on it probably not even
though I do love it
I might not even recommend it because
it's such a splurge I bought this when I
hit five hundred thousand subscribers
and I was like oh my God my mother
doesn't let me go crazy and buy
something I've always wanted to buy and
I bought this but I use this off camera
because I even feel guilty using it on
camera but it's good but it's so pricey
but I have two more primers to share
with you this one I love so much I hold
it's so close to my heart I love it this
is the cover effects calming a primer I
use this primer all the time when I
break out when my face is really
irritated if I have a lot of texture
problems or my face flares up or
something I always use this and it just
it's a calming primer
I love cover effects they're great brand
they have a lot of good ingredients in
their products and I just find that this
one does really calm at my skin and then
the last primer I have to share with you
guys is a new one to me but I am in love
I was head over heels the first time I
used it it is the Becca backlight
priming filter and I knew that this was
gonna give me a glow because Becca knows
how to do a glow better than anybody
else but this prolongs my makeup my
makeup stays on longer so it's a
prolonging primer and a super dewy
luminous primer let me show you really
quickly on the back of my hand can you
see that I have a right here
like your face beam's in the light it is
a beautiful primer I'm so happy I bought
it and I actually like the way it smells
like a cream like a moisturizer I don't
know I really really love it it's so
glowy I'm like I love it okay guys so
that completes of this makeup stash
video those were all my primers I know
I'm excessive I have one face it's
ridiculous I need to go through those
and get rid of some to be honest with
you so thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
