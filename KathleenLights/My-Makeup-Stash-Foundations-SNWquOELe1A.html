channel called my makeup stash today we
are going to talking about all of my
foundations I'm going to literally show
you all the foundations I own and tell
you what I think about them
my next makeup stash will be on my
high-end blushes okay
my disclaimers I got it I got a give
disclaimers I have a lot of foundations
and because I have so many I'm actually
excluding tinted moisturizers and BB
creams CC creams even anything targeted
like that is not going to be included so
like it cosmetics CC creams and BB
creams I won't be talking about them in
this video I'm going to specifically
talk about foundations advertised and
labeled as a foundation so I'm going to
start out with my all-time favorite
foundation like ever ever the best
foundation I have ever used it used to
be the Make Up For Ever HD that still is
in second place but my makeup forever
face and body has taken the place of it
honestly I am someone who has more
drugstore foundations than high-end as
you will see the majority of my
foundations are drugstore but to me make
up forevers makes the best foundations
like the HD and this is amazing and if
you have oily skin the matte velvet plus
I hear is fantastic as well so yes this
is the makeup firmer face and body I
have mine in the shade 20 this is my
regular shade and 32 this is my
self-tanning shade you're gonna see that
if I really like a product I have more
than one because sometimes I'm tan and
sometimes I'm not I love the packaging I
don't like the fact that it's glass so I
never travel with this but I really love
that it has a pump this is a super super
watery very liquidy foundation this is
honestly the best foundation I have ever
used it makes my skin completely
flawless and it has light coverage so
you would think that it wouldn't make my
skin look flawless but it does when I
put this on it's like my pores
completely diminish my skin tone is
really
even and it is a water-based gel
foundation it doesn't have any
emulsifiers and it creates like the most
natural it looks like skin basically
like you will put this foundation on and
it will never ever ever look like you
are wearing foundation it's also
waterproof this is my most long rain
foundation ever last is last through a
freaking rain rainstorm it's amazing but
remember it is very sheer that's why
it's like for face and body because
it'll just even everything out the
coverage is light coverage but I swear
that you can pile on ten layers of this
to get a medium coverage and it will
never look cakey so I have not what
little no okay I have nothing negative
to say about this except it smells
terrible it's not that it smells
terrible but it's very strong but after
I apply the rest of my face makeup I
can't smell any more but that initial is
a strong ass scent and it's the best of
the best it doesn't break me out which
thank the Lord because I used to love
Mac face and body foundation but it
broke me out horribly which is crazy
because this is like water I don't get
it but yes so so I went on and on about
it but it's my favorite my other
favourite as I just recently mentioned
is the Make Up For Ever HD I actually
have two colours in the shade 140 it's
my perfect color and I love this
foundation and have a backup I'm very
very very sad to hear that they changed
the formula and a bunch of people were
saying that they changed it and it's now
better if you didn't know make up
forevers formulated these foundations
the HD foundation to look incredible in
HD so like with your HD camera in video
all that stuff this foundation is
supposed to look flawless with HD and it
does so now their new HD foundation is
supposed to be like compatible with with
like 4k that like extra extra extra HD
but I'm really nervous to try out that
formula because this one was already so
good I don't know why they changed it I
love this whenever I'm taking photos
this just looks great in pictures I
don't know what it is but it's great and
I love that it's plastic
has a pump this is the foundation I
always travel with so in the winter my
face is like so dry at least it was in
Mississippi I don't know how my skin's
gonna react to now that I'm back in
South Florida but I'm Mississippi my
skates with mice case my face would like
peel it was so dry and I ended up really
loving the Maybelline fit me foundation
I feel like no one likes this unless you
have very dry skin I have mine 120 which
is my normal shade and 220 is my tan
shade and this is hella dewy like hella
- but whenever my skin is like acting up
and just looks like a snake
this picks it right back up I love the
finish I just love that I look like
Jennifer Lopez when I wear this it's so
moisturizing I I just love the
Maybelline fit me line and then recently
not recently but they came out with the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless and
I picked it up to mix with the regular
fit me because sometimes this is just
too dewy for me so I find that this is
perfect actually I'm in love with the
matte and poreless I have discovered
that I like it even more than the
original fit me which is crazy I just
use like an illuminating primer and this
sits so well on the skin I really do
feel like it's poreless almost it
doesn't accentuate my pores it has like
that Demi matte finish it's not too
matte which I really appreciate and it
just looks beautiful it just looks
beautiful on the skin I really highly
recommend the men for this then I have
this guy which you have not seen in a
hot minute on my channel it is the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation I have mine
in 3.0 it's the foundation I'm wearing
today I had not used this because during
the winter it was just it was
accentuating my dry patches a bit but in
the summer I actually really like this I
had a love-hate relationship with this
in the beginning and I was like I don't
know if it works for my dry skin but
then when my skin is like extra hydrated
or it's feeling normal it looks
beautiful
so it's like sometimes I love it
sometimes I don't recently I have been
loving it because
I found that this lies beautifully on
top of my Laura Mercier foundation
primer in radians because this gives
like a beautiful golden glow to the face
and this sits so nicely on top of it so
I have been using it again it claims to
be weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup and I completely agree it kind of
is weightless I do not feel it on my
skin at all I will say that out of all
my foundations this one makes my skin
feel the nicest like when I put it on
and I touch my face even if I don't set
it it doesn't feel like I'm wearing
anything it sets so beautifully my
favorite favorite favorite favorite
favorite drugstore foundation ever that
we will be talking about right now
it is the Bourjois healthy mix serum I
purchased mine for the first time off of
Amazon and then two subscribers had sent
me other ones like backups because I
cannot get this in the States and I have
a hard time finding my color on Amazon I
freaking love this this is the best like
um affordable foundation ever ever it's
a serum let me tell you the colors I
have 52 I have 252 s this is my normal
shade and then I have one in 53 which is
like one of a little bit more tan I did
a whole review on this like that in the
dizzle this is a gel foundation that
supposedly lasts for 16 hours I don't
think it lasts that long but it sits so
nicely on my skin for the entire day I
don't get greasy
it doesn't cling onto my dry patches
this one because it's the healthy mix
serum is very luminous and like fresh
looking it's dewy like you look like
you're having a very good skin day when
you are wearing this like every time I
put this on I'm like wow I look so glowy
and healthy healthy mix I get it it has
vitamins in this it's vitamin rich
fruits goji berry pomegranate all that
stuff it does smell like strong fruits
and at first it threw me off but now I
love the scent of this foundation like
it's a it's a treat while I apply it to
my face it's also hyper allergenic it
should not break you out I have very
sensitive skin
this just works well with my skin and
then I do have the Bourjois healthy mix
foundation this one has a pump too by
the way there are two different um
foundations but they're very similar I
love that this one also has a pump I
like to wear the healthy mix more in the
summertime this one works really well in
the summer and in the winter but since
this one is a little bit more of that
semi matte finish I like to wear it in
the summer it gives a semi matte but
like a healthy glow as well it's crazy
it's so good
says it's also for 16 hours and it has
fruit therapy by the way the bourgeois
serum says it's anti fatigue the way I'm
highly highly impressed by the healthy
mix range from bourgeois and I highly
recommend them if you can get them in
your country they're so good
it's another drugstore foundation I have
and I loved it when I first purchased it
and I haven't used it in so long it's
they nurtured nurture Neutrogena Healthy
Skin liquid makeup it has an SPF of 20 I
haven't even told you guys the SPF and
these things
I don't think bourgeois has SPF made it
does The Naked skin the fit me has as
you have a teen and none of the Make Up
For Ever ones have SPF I hate when
foundation has SPF in it and I know that
SPF is really important for you but I
like to apply my own SPF underneath my
foundation that way if I want to wear
that same foundation at nighttime and
take pictures I don't have an SPF
flashback if your foundation has a high
SPF sometimes in photography you have
like a white cast on your face and I
hate that that's why I like applying my
own SPF and then just not have SPF on if
I'm going on at night this has SPF 20
and I like wearing this during the
daytime it does make your skin look
healthy like this is the healthy skin
liquid makeup it does make your skin
look healthy it's not too dewy it's not
too glowy
but it's not matte it's not sad it's
that perfect healthy look to your skin
those are my favorite types of
foundations the coverage I would say is
medium but very buildable and a lot of
people compare this to the NARS sheer
glow foundation everyone says it's a
dupe I loved the NARS sheer glow but I
had to return it because it broke me out
really badly in like white little bumps
over my face this doesn't break me out
so if you are into the NARS sheer glow
check out the healthy skin liquid makeup
I don't know if they're dupes because I
don't really remember but this is a good
one okay so another one that I don't
really use and it's because I'm not so
over-the-moon obsessed this is the Laura
Mercier silk cream foundation and I
think they reformulated this or they
discontinued it I'm not exactly sure I
have mine in bamboo beige this is like
when I'm fresh tan like when I just
apply my tan maybe that's why I haven't
used it so much it says it's a luminous
formula but I find it just a little bit
heavy on my face it is that moosie
consistency but for everyday wear it's
not my favorite this looks gorgeous um
if I'm like going on at nighttime and I
want like that flawless full coverage
because to me this gives me full
coverage this looks great for like night
time at makeup it's just a little bit
heavier than my lightweight foundations
which is why I don't grab for it as much
and let me know down below if you know
if this got discontinued or what they
did with this formula another similar
foundation that I have is the Rimmel
stay matte foundation I have mine in
true ivory this is like my winter shade
which is why I haven't used it in a
while when this first came out I did a
review on it and I loved it I remember
loving it and it's really similar to
this it has that same consistency it's
like a mousse II I actually got
complimented so many times on my skin
when I wore this foundation it's pretty
ridiculous like every time I worked
someone's like whoa what foundation are
you wearing your skin looks flawless and
it was this more drugstore I had I only
have like drugstore blushes rarely do I
buy a high-end blush have I said blush
this whole time this is the covergirl
outlast stay luminous this is a new one
to my collection I recently did a review
on it
so you can go check that out I have mine
in 842 and I don't think this has this
you have hmm
I love this foundation I didn't notice
the little shimmers in this until I was
looking at the bottle recently but the
shimmers the little like gold shimmers
don't show up on your face at all like
you don't have glitters on your face
like you do with the cosmetics a c+
illumination this crap is glittery I
love how this makes my skin look it's
very dewy very fresh and it's dewy but
it has really great coverage it's
buildable and you get that flawless
coverage with the dewy JLo effect I love
that it has a pump I really really have
been enjoying this foundation recently
and another one that I recently picked
up is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
because everyone has been talking about
this I have mine in 103 natural buff
this is like super matte on my skin I
have dry skin but I just wanted to try
it out because everybody loves it this
is so matte but if I use a very very
very illuminating primer this looks
really nice on the skin and it lasts
forever if you have oily skin and you
haven't tried this you need to try this
in your life if you have normal skin and
you haven't try it try it try it because
this will last you throughout your
entire work day and it's oil-free it's
good stuff this is the cover FX natural
finish oil-free foundation I find it to
be kind of similar just not as matte I
have mine in the shade G 30 I haven't
been using this as much as I did when I
first got it it's full coverage it looks
really nice on the skin your makeup
looks really pretty on top of it and
cover FX is actually one of those brands
that tries to put the best they can in
their ingredients like their ingredients
are actually really good for you they're
not like incredibly natural or anything
but if you like read up on cover FX
their ingredients are actually better
than your average foundation or anything
so this is a good one okay so my other
favorite drugstore foundation I said
that this was my favorite drugstore
foundation but this one is as well so
it's like a tie this is the Revlon
Colorstay foundation this is the first
foundation I ever ever purchased in my
life ever
I didn't start wearing foundation till I
was 18 years old and this is the first
one I
and I have mine for normal to dry skin I
hate the Revlon Colorstay foundation
that's targeted to oily skin because
it's way too heavy on my skin it looks
cakey it feels like a mask I hate it but
this one I actually really love I only
like to apply this with a Beauty Blender
because a Beauty Blender shears it out a
little bit and it gives me a more
natural finish this is hella full
coverage but it's great on those days
where you're like dude I just need full
coverage I need my makeup to last I need
that and that's when I go for this it
lasts forever ever ever ever ever I have
fresh base my tan shade and 150 buff
which is too light for me even when I'm
not tanning but I just mix a drop of
this okay we're almost done I have two
more to share with you guys this is the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi healthy luminous
makeup this has an SPF of 20 and I'm in
the shade w3 I love this I love that has
a pump I just I think this foundation is
great I used to have the L'Oreal True
Match the regular one and I really
really liked it too but I found that I
just always reached for this one more so
I just gave that one away this looks so
beautiful on the skin like very dewy
very luminous but it doesn't make you
look greasy at the end of the day I
recently purchased the giorgio armani
luminous silk foundation when i hit a
million subscribers i was like oh my god
I had a million subscribers I'm gonna go
treat myself to that Giorgio Armani
foundation that I've always wanted I
bought it I used it twice hated it and
returned it it made me look like a
greasy hot dog at the end of the day it
didn't lie it was beautiful the second I
applied it and it looked great in that
video where I was using it but by like 4
hours in I just looked greasy and it
looked like it was breaking apart it was
the weirdest saying my face also itched
when I wore it was the strangest thing
for $62 I was like oh no you better
change my life for 62 Lars so I returned
it I don't think it's worth the money
everybody told me to buy it everybody
loves it I know a lot of you guys are
looking at this like huh you didn't like
luminous silk and but I didn't work for
me
personally I don't think $62 girls that
is suspense
okay and I don't think it was worth it
but anyway I love The True Match Lumi it
gives me that luminous glow without
feeling like a hot dog
and then the last foundation I want to
share with you guys is my most recent
foundation this is the ex1 and visit
where liquid foundation I was sent like
all of them and let me tell you that the
color selection sucks for this it's one
invisible foundation because I have mine
and f-100 and it's my color and it's the
lightest color that they have and I know
that there are girls more fair than I am
so they need to like step it up with
their color selection but anyway this
foundation is amazing I'm so impressed
with this I have over-the-moon in love
with this foundation it only took one
try for me to be like wow wow this is so
good I went to the ex1 website because I
believe you could only get this online I
think if you go to the ax1 website it
also tells you places where you can
purchase it just go on their website but
they claim to be really great for olive
skin tones so this foundation works well
with a tan but it looks literally
invisible on your skin it's creamy and
it goes on your skin like so soft so
easy to blend and it just makes your
skin look flawless it has like medium
coverage and it just looks evened out
and beautiful it's not matte it's not
dewy it's just like perfect okay so
those were all the foundations I don't
want let me know if you want to see
primers or would face primers be kind of
like a stupid makeup stash video I don't
know
let me oh my next video my next makeup
stash video will be on high-end blushes
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you're enjoying this makeup series
and I hope it's kind of helpful I love
you guys please subscribe haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
