another makeup stache video I told you
guys in my last makeup sense video that
today or that my next one would be on
high-end blushes my last one was on
foundations but the one before that it
was on my drugstore blush collection so
if you're not into high-end blushes and
you haven't seen that one then check out
my drugstore blush question so let's go
ahead and get started because I have a
lot of high-end blushes I think I have
more high-end blushes than I do
drugstore I'm gonna start with my Mac
ones because I have the most it's a
mineralized skinfinish but this is in
the shade
cheeky bronze um I use it as a blush
though because this is too dark to be a
highlight but this is such a beautiful
rose gold blush for me and because it is
a mineralized skinfinish it's not super
opaque so it doesn't go on like a
full-on blush I like using it as a blush
topper or like on a regular day in the
summer when I don't want too much blush
I just like dust this on my cheeks which
you guys know I don't pack on the blush
ever like I don't pack it on okay ah
this one I got at Assisi oh you don't
know what a CCO is it stands for
cosmetic company Outlet they're usually
like a premium outlet malls the closest
one to me is the one in Orlando and they
have a discounted makeup there and all
of the makeup that there is usually
discontinued so I pick this up there and
I love this blush but I don't really use
it on camera because it is discontinued
it's called full of joy and I like it
because it's scary-looking but I
swatches so much lighter than what it
looks like it almost swatches like an
iridescent which I like I like how it
looks on the cheeks cuz it gives it like
a soft purple angelic glow this is
technically a blush so that's why I'm
including it in this video but this is
called harmony I use this as a
contouring powder or as a oh I have five
seconds to be at that place I don't have
time to bronze and put on blush I'm
gonna settle this one this is my third
Harmonie blush I have been using this
since I was 16 I didn't start wearing
makeup too like 18 years old but I
always wore mascara a lipstick and this
that's all I did
this is margin and it's probably one of
my favorite Mac blushes of all time this
is so pretty in the summertime honestly
like this is the kind of blush that you
could really pack on your face and it
doesn't look ugly like it doesn't look
too much it's a good one if you haven't
tried margin just go to max watch it on
the back your hand it doesn't swatch as
pretty as it applies but this one is
spring sheen this is one of my first
blushes ever this blush is in tant's
this is really intense like you can get
really heavy-handed with this real fast
but it's a nice summer blush as well I
really recommend it especially for this
time of year Spring Sheen reminds me a
lot of Mac no NARS orgasm but I don't
like orgasm I think I'm the only person
in the world who does not like narses
orgasm blush it's too sparkly like it's
there's something about it that I don't
like it feels almost chunky comment
below if you don't like Nora's orgasm
either this blush is called Melba and if
you have minute subscriber of my since I
started my channel I'm talking like ogee
videos og subscriber this was my
favorite blush in the history of life
like it was in my must have makeup
products of all time and I don't use it
as much but look at the color it's such
a nice color this is the perfect
everyday blush for some reason I don't
use it as much anymore because I love
matte blushes I used to be so into them
and now I'm kind of into the more glowy
blush this one is called cubic and I've
never tried never used this on my
channel because I just recently got it
and I wanted a blush that would look
great for looks like this or a cool tone
looks like like I'm very cool toned
today but like a very cool tone makeup
look I wanted the perfect blush to pair
with it so I wanted something that was
not too intense not too Brown not too
purple something like in the middle
cubic my Mac it's a good one this blush
is awesome I wore this on Mother's Day I
wore this like that Mother's Day weekend
I were like all week I had like an
obsession
with this this is called trace gold I
don't know if I said that already it's
pretty much a gold blush when it makes
your face Jennifer Lopez you put this on
and you're like oh look at that I'm Joe
develop is now it's amazing I love trace
gold I feel like it comes on like a Mac
video all on its own oh by the way I
forgot to mention my makeup geek blushes
in my drugstore blush video and I didn't
mention it because technically it's on a
drugstore blush but there are ten
dollars so they're cheaper than the
average blush but I'm not going to
include it in this video either I have
an entire video I have to actually
entire videos dedicated to makeup geek
and all my favorite things and I show
you guys the blushes I own all the
makeup geek blushes and I love them
they're one of my favorite blushes ever
but I keep them with my palettes I don't
keep them in my blush drawer so
sometimes I don't even remember that I
have them I need to bring them over here
to my blush drawer because I love them
they're great so yeah I won't be talking
about them in this video but know that I
own them all and that they are fantastic
all of them this blush is called new
romance and it's one of their
mineralized blushes I love the
mineralized blush line because they're
like baked products and they look just
really pretty on the skin they kind of
like second skin they don't look powdery
on the face it honestly is a highlight
more than anything but on my skin tone
it's a nice super intensely glowy peachy
blush okay and this one is probably my
other favorite blush ever it's another
mineralized blush and it's called the
warm sole which I'm sure you guys have
seen because it's a very popular blush
from Mac and for a good reason this
blush looks good with everything it even
looks good with like cool tone makeup
warm tummy this blush looks amazing it's
amazing if you don't own warm soul out
of all the Mac blushes I spoke about
warm soul get warm soul get it I have um
two blushes by the balm I have this one
in hot mama which honestly this one is
probably an even better dupe for NARS
orgasm without the chunkiness to it it's
such a pretty pinky Goldy peachy shade
and then I have this one that I spoken
about in a recent favorites video this
is called bomb desert
I honestly use this as a bronzer because
it
targeted as a bronzer / blush which is
why I'm talking about in this video
because I have it in my blush drawer but
I use it the same way I use Mac's
harmony the same exact way so I really
really really love this one too and I
think that on my skin this one even this
one lasts even longer than harmony I
have three of the Clinique cheek pop
blush pops this one is a new one that I
just recently picked up this is called
pansy pop honestly these have become
like one of my favorite formulations of
blushes ever I wanted to get panty pop
because I don't really use blushes like
this at least you guys know like do I
ever wear blushes like this no not
really but this looked like such a
pretty blush reminds me a lot of full of
joy actually but oh actually okay no
scratch that they're out they're not
similar at all these almost feel like a
gel consistency it's so crazy their
powder but they feel creamy almost and
they look fantastic on the skin this is
my favorite one this one is nude pop I
wore the she's out of this when I first
got it it's a really really good one I
even love the packaging there's just
like acrylic and pretty and then this
one is melon pop it's a nice peachy
color perfect for the summer time these
are the new two-faced love flush
long-lasting 16 long-lasting 16 hour
blushes they came out with six but I
only have four I gave one to my sister
and one to my friend Gaby those were
like a little too dark for me but I have
this one in love hangover it's a really
pretty everyday pink color this one is
called justify my love and it's a purple
color but it's not too intense on the
face which I really like it and then
these two are my favorites
I spoke about them in my favorites video
this one is called I will always love
you it's the one I've used the most
it's a peachy peachy beautiful beautiful
I love it and then this one is baby love
which is I think this would be a lot of
people's favorites because it's a nude
blush like a straight-up nude blush so
it pairs well with everything I have to
benefit boxed powders and honestly I
never use these and I'm so upset because
they're so good you know
I think throws me off as the packaging I
know people love the packaging on this
but does anybody else agree that it's
like a box like a bowl yep I'll like a
bulky box but I'm up I'm like big on
packaging which is really stupid the
product should matter most but anyway
I have benefits Dallas and this is a
really beautiful blush because it works
the same way as Mac harmony and the bomb
desert though and I really love those
kind of things that are bronzers but
then they double as blush because of
that mommy kind of undertone it's so
pretty and I rarely rarely rarely ever
wear it by the way if you're wondering
onto my lips because I already had
posted this tutorial but I was wearing a
different lip I will have a dumb below
because I changed my lip color but just
in case you were wondering and then I
have rocket or which is probably my
favorite one out of all of the benefit
box the blushes good till I've used it I
don't know if you could tell but I used
it a lot when I first got it it's a
beautiful rose gold like it's up here
rose gold but I only love wearing this
when I have like a tan like I do now it
looks stunning with a tan oh I forgot to
show this when I was talking about the
bomb this is the cindy lou manizer this
is technically like a highlight but on
me it's very much a blush even though it
doesn't I mean now with my tan it's
probably a highlight when I'm really
really fair this is a beautiful peachy
blush but now this would be a really
pretty highlight hmm
oh you guys saw my high-end products my
favorite high-end products of all time I
spoke about this product it's one of my
favorite makeup items ever and I don't
really use it on camera I mean I only
use this in the summertime it's one of
my favorite items I own the cindy lou
manizer I like it better than the mary
lou manizer but it is beautiful it's
like a peach glow but I have a lot of
peachy glowy things as I mentioned
earlier but this makes my skin glow like
no other I have four of the new Urban
Decay's what was that word Urban Decay
afterglow eight hour blushes I have two
that I purchased myself and then Urban
Decay actually sent me two of them but
these are the two that I purchased
myself this is the first one I got this
is in the shade fetish it's a really
pretty mouth color goes really well with
everything I like that it's not too too
too too too intense not too pigmented
those are my favorite kind of blushes
this has the prettiest packaging on a
blush I've ever seen I love it and then
I bought this one this is in decent
because I mean it looked like my kinda
blush a freaking peach are you surprised
cuz I'm not it's matte which usually a
lot of my peach bushes are like glowy so
I wanted like a matte peach blush and
it's pretty I like it and then every
decay sent me these two this one this
one is called obsessed it's a cool tone
purpley pink I don't typically go for
these colors but it's really pretty like
this would look really nice and then
they sent me this one which I'm so
afraid of like I don't know I didn't
want to give this away to my sister
because I want to try I want to see how
it looks on me this one is in the shade
of rapture and I feel like this would be
beautiful on dark skin tones this is
like a berry color and I don't know if
this would they even look good on me
what do you think too dark for me I
don't I have to NARS blushes this one is
in the shade luster this one is gorgeous
I feel like I've held up like ten
glasses that look just like this this is
like a peach with a lot of gold shimmer
in it but it's not like chunky orgasm II
sugar shimmer and then this bad boy I
take this with me every time
I go on vacation I took it with me to LA
when I was there this isn't a shade of
madly this is my favorite brush of all
time I have a crap ton of bushes this is
my favorite blush ever ever ever I've
spoken about this a million times you
probably know this is madly it's
described as a seashell pink and I guess
that vibe it reminds me of a goddess
walking on the beach with flowers in her
hair and like a big seashell necklace
talking about life's mysteries wearing
this blush if you don't have madly what
are you s watches ugly like when i
swatched it for the first time I was
like oh this is nothing but it applies
to face beautifully okay so I have girl
lactic blushes and I rare I never wear
these on camera but one of them actually
wear all the time okay so they're like
this they're little they're very small
blushes this is in the shade Naples this
is the one that I've worn a bunch of
times it's almost like a highlight but
it's not I mean it is definitely for a
lot of skin tones is a highlight I like
it cuz it gives my cheeks that extra
glow whenever like something is like too
matte on my face I like to pop this on
my cheeks as a soft soft pink
but it's pretty these are just a tiny
bit powdery but because they're very
very pigmented they don't look powdery
on the skin like when you apply it to
your face it doesn't look powdery but
when you likes watching them they're not
like buttery but they're very pigmented
so yeah this one is called Florence and
this one is like a matte uh peach pink
you can never go wrong with these they
look really nice paired with a lot of
different looks I like that they're
really little because they're easy to
travel with and then this one is in the
style Milani it's a really pretty cool
tone purple with a little bit of mauve
in it I have to Charlotte Tilbury
blushes and okay if you guys don't know
let me tell you a little a little secret
it's not really a secret but there are
some brands I know that you guys feel
the same way there are some brands out
there that were like everything that
that company comes out with you're like
that's mine I love it I will buy it
mine is two-faced like that's
I feel about two-faced they're my
favorite high-end brand but Charlotte
Tilbury makes me weak in the knees
I have tried why you sell products not
crazy about them dear whatever I'm not
crazy about them I'm not crazy about her
Armani like I'm not Charlotte Tilbury
makes me weak in the knees it's such a
pricey brand but to me that brand is
worth the money I love the packaging I
love the woman herself I follow her on
YouTube Charlotte Tilbury it's just
whatever anyway so I have to Charlotte
Tilbury blushes and they're super pricey
but I think they are worth the money
this one is called first love which I
love this one this is my favorite one
out of two this is what it looks like it
looks like a freaking nipple I mean it
looks like a tit it's weird but the idea
behind this is there they are swish and
pop blushers so you're supposed to like
swish it around and then pop it in the
center does that make sense you get your
brush in your like through and then
apply it to your cheeks like that but I
just I swish I don't pop I just like
swish around the whole thing I swish all
over this boob so this one is first love
I like it because it's very soft I like
very soft blush as if you can't tell and
it just goes well with everything I love
the packaging some people say it looks
like via and I love it it's vintage to
me I love it and then this one is called
ecstasy this one is gorgeous in the
summertime too it's like a coral it's a
really really beautiful coral blush I
have from Sephora they are they're micro
smooth blushes this one is in the shade
tea rose tickle it's a really pretty mom
that's all there is to it it's a nice
mouth but it has a nice Sheen to it
these micro smooth blushes are so pretty
and they're so underrated but this one
is a beautiful mauve that gives your
cheeks and nests glow and then this one
is called tangerine tease this is so
beautiful you have one side that's like
a more red orange and then this one is a
more peachy orange so mixed together
gives you a beautiful orange a luminous
delicious popsicle looking blush so
pretty in the spring and summer I only
have one Becca blush because okay well I
love
I absolutely love the Becca highlights
their blushes can get intense real quick
um I have wild honey and I do want song
myrrh song bird I just don't own it yet
but I have wild honey they big ones just
like their highlighters only smaller
look how beautiful that color is oh my
god you could this is one of my top five
favorite blushes ever but it's so
pigmented you need a very not this color
is pigmented the formula of these are
pigmented like you barely touched this
with a brush and it's insane which is a
good thing or a bad thing you just have
you need a very light hand but I mean
look at this color cuz you just like
melt in this color it's all pretty okay
and then the labs or blushes I have to
share with you guys are Tarte Amazonian
clay blushes if you haven't tried to
name the Tarte blushes they're amazing
they say they claim to be 12-hour
blushes and who knows I believe it
because they say on my face like no
other like these blushes lasts forever I
have this one in exposed it's their ma
be nude one it's a mauve it looks really
really beautiful in the winter time I
love this blush in the winter it's
literally the blush I wear the most I
have this one on my cheeks right now
this is called celebrated but as you can
see it has like a weird packaging
because this came out with their like
tartlets set um and I don't know they
need to make this permanent why would
they bring out a blush this beautiful
and then take it away from us I don't
understand it's such a pretty cool toned
like light rosy nude this looks really
similar to makeup geeks spellbound so if
you didn't get a chance to get this gets
Popa from makeup geek because they are
very similar this is a little bit
lighter and then I have this one which I
think this is pretty new because I did I
just recently got it and I hadn't seen
it before so I don't know if this is
limited edition but I know it's still
available this is in the shade energy if
you are familiar with Tarte you know
they have like the energy lip gloss the
energy like chubby stick it's supposed
to like change with your skin like you
put on the lip gloss and it gets pinky
or whatever this is what it looks like
oh my god okay no man they're different
there
okay yeah this one is a lot more pink
it's like a babydoll pink basically okay
guys so those were all my high end
blushes I have so many blushes um if you
have a favorite blush that I don't have
here a high end blush that you
absolutely love that I don't have let me
