in my makeup stash series the first
video I posted was my bronzer collection
and we went through my whole bronzer
collection and today it is highlighters
I asked you guys on Twitter if you
wanted to see blush first or if you
wanted to see highlighters first and
like 80% of you said you wanted to see
highlighters first I will link my
bronzer collection down below if you
have not seen it but if you don't know
I'm doing this series on my channel
where I show you guys like my entire
makeup collection but in little section
so today well very big sections
today it's highlighters and we will go
through all of my highlighters and i'm
swatching them and all that stuff and i
do not know if you guys are prepared for
what you are about to see cuz I love
highlighters oh by the way this makeup
look I just filmed it and it will be up
sometime next week ok so I'm not gonna
lie I have more high end highlighters
than I do drugstore I have a lot of
drugs to our blushes but for some reason
the drugstore relax like those amazing
highlighters well the drugstore
highlights I have are amazing you know
what I mean I feel like they to just
like start coming out with amazing
highlighters at CVS like so the first
little pile of highlighters I'm going to
be talking about our liquid highlighters
I don't have too many liquid ones so I'm
going to go through these first and in
no particular order let's begin this is
the body shop radiant highlighter it's a
liquidy highlighter that has a pinky
champagne more pinky silver actually
undertone it's actually really really
beautiful how I like to use this one is
more of like a primer I like to put this
on my entire face and then put my
foundation on top I purchased this one
at a body shop in California and I love
it I think the quality is really good
you could also use this as like a spot
highlighting like a like a you would
normally highlight but it is really nice
before my foundation I have
mixing with foundation but I like it as
like a really super intense primer this
is the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
in opal this is not the pressed one I
have the pressed one in opal as well but
this is the liquid one out of all of
their liquid skin perfectors I love opal
the most it's such a beautiful um I
don't even know how to describe it it's
like a champagne with a little bit of
gold with a little bit of pink um I
don't know the undertone is just like
kind of unique if you think about it it
works well with so many skin tones I'm
talking so many skin tones I love using
this mixed in with my foundation this
one I like to use it alone but this one
looks great as a primer it looks great
mixed with your foundation it looks
great by itself this one is definitely a
really really good one so this is my
favorite liquid highlight of all time
and I rarely use it on camera I don't
know why but this is the Josie Maran
Argan illuminizer they have a different
packaging now which the packaging they
have now is better than this I feel like
the pump is better so this comes with a
pump it's amazing it's a super super
intense gold highlight like real intense
and beautiful I highly recommend this
one because it's the most intense I feel
out of all the liquid ones I have but
it's nice I also have this one that I
purchased to myself this is the drawer
Cosmetics BB + illumination facial cream
now I had to get another one they
descend another one because the pump was
broken on my original one um but this
one is very very similar to the Josie
Maran
the Gerard cosmetics one is more of a
lotion this one's a little bit thicker
more creamy I like this one a lot better
not a lot better but I do like this one
better but this one is great to mix with
your foundation as well I'm not like a
huge fan of Gerard cosmetics my own
that's a good one it's a good it's a
good product it's a good product okay
and last in the liquid um I liked
category I have these three right here I
got this during the holiday they came in
like a
set these are Becca shimmering skin
perfecter zits basically this but during
Christmas they had like little ones I
have opal champagne gold which is like a
yellowy gold color and then I have pearl
which is like a whitish highlight I
really love this one actually doesn't
look like something I would like but
it's very nice I have three cream
highlighters which is weird because I
actually really like cream highlighters
and surprise I only have three of them
and two of them are Mac creme color
basis I have this one in the shade of
pearl which is the first one I ever
purchased and then this one in this
shade shell this is actually the
highlight I'm wearing on my cheekbones
right now she'll I have another I have
like a powder highlight on top but the
main glorious thing on my face is shell
these are amazing they last all day
probably one of the most long wearing
highlights in my collection are these
guys cuz they set on your face and then
they don't go anywhere
this one's more of a white gold and this
one is more pink just depending on on
your preference you can find a color
that you will love I also really like
hush but I don't own that one but I will
because it's beautiful and then I have
this one from girl lactic Beauty this is
a pearl base this is enough for your
eyes which I think's or the Mac ones but
I use this on my face and I love it this
is also a pinky highlight but um I don't
know if you can tell shell is more rosy
and this one is more of a really cool
tone like silvery pink beautiful
nonetheless I love this the formula is a
little bit tricky it isn't as creamy as
those but it's so beautiful I love them
okay so the rest of these highlights are
powder highlight so let's jam it I have
two elf baked highlighters and these are
my favorite I did have one called gem
blush gems but I gave that one away
because these two I liked the most this
one is in moonlight pearl and this one
is in pink diamonds obviously this one's
pea
and this one's more of a champagne gold
I love baked products in general but elf
makes really really nice baked
highlighters especially where drugstore
is concerned these are really really
good and I feel like they don't get
talked about and I don't know why
because they're amazing I love them
they're very pigmented and really smooth
on the face but my favorite baked
products from elf in terms of
highlighting is actually a blush but I
mean it's labeled a blush but it's 100%
not a blush it is their baked blush in
the shade pink tastic this is what it
looks like this is my favorite one out
of these three this one is definitely my
favorite the undertone it's so so pretty
and out of all of them this feels the
smoothest like it goes on the best and
the most pigmented that makes sense this
one is so good okay let's talk about
these make up forever pro sculpting duos
I touched base on the bronzers in my
bronzer collection video but now we're
going to talk about the exciting part of
these tool a knitted of these duos
and it's the highlight this is what they
look like this one is in the shade 0-1
and this one is in the shade zero to the
bronzers are pretty similar one it's
just a little bit deeper but the
highlights are completely different
this one is a pinky silver highlight and
this one is a beautiful gold they're
both equally pretty this one gets a lot
more hype zero to the gold one but this
one is just as nice this one I feel like
is even more intense like it's so
reflective on the skin if you have a
deeper skin tone I recommend this one if
you are fair I recommend this one they
could still both work but you know this
is the mary lou manizer by the balm it's
not metallic the way that these are
these give more of a metallic finish
this one is just like a super intense
glow if that makes sense the formula is
completely different this one feels
powdery
not like chalky but it feels like a
powder while the Make Up For Ever ones
almost feel like a gel like a silk it's
kind of strange but this one gives you
such a pretty glow to the top of the
cheeks and I don't use
as often as I should and I don't know
why because it's definitely a cult
favorite this is my favorite drugstore
highlight in the entire world and
definitely one of my top favorite
highlights ever drugstore or high-end
Physicians Formula shimmer strip in the
shade Miami strip this is what it looks
like I tend to keep my brush towards the
top because I'm a little bit more fair
so if I want the highlight to look
really intense I just keep it up here if
I want to add more of a bronze look to
my skin I'll dip my brush into the
bronzer shades I really like this
because it suits different skin tones
because of the different colored strips
you do have to work with it because it's
kind of like a thicker powder I don't
know how to explain it but you can't
really use like it's just a little
fluffy brush and dip it in lightly and
expect to get a lot of color payoff you
do have to go in with like a more dense
brush I like using one like this this is
the Real Techniques umm 300 brush and
like really popping my brush in there
and then applying it to my cheeks that
way and then it gives like an intense
Jennifer Lopez like Jenny from the block
like whoa whoa whoa well we're on
Physicians Formula might as well talk
about the other one I own this is
another shimmer strip but this one is in
the shade natural nude now this one the
formula is a hundred percent different
but it does give kind of like the same
effect when you dip your finger in these
it's so silky so buttery and so
pigmented that you really do need a
light hand with this one you can go in
with a fluffy brush and only dab it in
lightly and then apply it to your cheeks
and you still get a nice intense um
highlight I just find that this one
lasts longer on my cheeks then this one
does I don't know why but they're both
equally beautiful they're very similar
but they're just different in terms of
formula these are the Bobby Brown
highlights that I own Bobby Brown is
very very famous for their shimmer
bricks very very similar to these by
Physicians Formula I definitely would
call this a dupe but this formula is a
little bit so keyer
so I'm gonna talk about these three that
I own and then I'll talk about this one
these are their shimmer bricks obviously
I just said that and I have pink quartz
bronze and apricot now I got apricot
apricot apricot apricot and it's
beautiful it's my favorite one
but they don't make this one anymore I
got this one at a CCO when I was in
Orlando I don't know why I didn't make
this permanent because it's a beautiful
highlight nothing in my collection looks
like this believe it or not because I
have Goldy highlights pinky highlights
you know and this one has like an orange
undertone it's a gold with orange in it
which orange is my favorite makeup color
to wear so I really love this one sucks
that you can't get it try finding it at
a local CCO then this one in the shade
bronze is a really pretty bronzer for me
I do use these two more of a highlight
on the top of my cheeks but this is a
beautiful highlighting bronzer I'm
mentioning this in a highlighter video
and not my bronzer video because this is
a highlight for medium to deep skin
tones if you have very dark skin this
would be the most beautiful color on the
top of your cheekbones and then this one
oh and then this one definitely has to
be my favorite permanent one they still
sell this one is pink quartz and it's so
pretty it's like a pink but a silver and
a gold and a bronze all in one it's so
gorgeous on the skin you guys have no
idea this one is seriously beautiful
these are expensive but they pretty and
then this one was limited edition as
well but I do want to show you that I
have it this is bronze glow I like the
packaging on this one this was a limited
edition one that I could not get my
hands on and then like a couple of
months ago they brought it back for like
a day and I was on it and I ordered it
the texture of this one is so different
but the color is too light for the
formula is my favorite thing about it it
feels like butter when you put your
finger in this so I'm just mentioning it
just in case
they decide to just put it on the
website again bronze glow is beautiful
this is the elf
sun-kissed glow bronzer but it's a
highlight in the shade Sunkist I've
spoken about this in a recent favorites
video I love this it's such an intense
Gold and it's two dollars it's so pretty
it's like a gold highlight not like a
white gold champagne gold it's gold but
it it's a good gold I love it and it's
so affordable you really can't go wrong
with this I highly recommend you try it
out speaking of gold this is a new one
for me this is the laura geller baked
gelato illuminator in gilded honey I
heard Rosita Applebaum talked about this
Rosita everyone says this is a dupe for
a Mac whisper of guilt or Estee Lauder
heatwave I don't own those but if they
look like this then I know why everybody
was obsessed with them because this is
beautiful the formula is so silky very
similar to the formula in the makeup
forever dual wear it kind of it doesn't
feel like a powder it feels like
something else not like a cream but just
so silky that it doesn't feel like
you're putting your finger in a powder
and I love applying this with a brush
just like that Real Techniques one
because it makes it like go on super
intensely I love this and it's really
nice for traveling cuz it's so little I
think I don't like the packaging I mean
for what it costs you better have a
better package I want to talk about
really natural highlights now I have
three highlights that I use whenever I
want a glow but I don't want to look
like Jennifer Lopez which I mean doesn't
happen often but sometimes I just want
something really natural like for
example if I'm going for a really
minimal makeup look you know just very
little bit of makeup chances are I'm
gonna put on highlight anyway because
it's my favorite part of makeup but I
don't want like super intense when I
make when the rest of my makeup is so
like natural so I'm going to talk about
three my three natural ones this is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in
luminous light and this
what it looks like this is the highlight
I have on the top of my cheekbones right
now on top of shell so you could only
see it very little that glow is 100%
backshell I recommend this for a bride
for someone who's scared to highlight
the face this is the kind of powder that
gives you a glow from within like if you
have really really oily skin I think you
would really like this if you have oily
skin and you're scared to highlight the
face you don't want to look greasy I
highly recommend the hourglass ones this
one is the girl lactic face glow in the
shade natural and that's exactly what it
is it's natural but it's beautiful
this one is my favorite when I'm wearing
mascara eyebrows and concealer this is
my favorite because it gives like a
noticeable glow but it's so natural that
it looks like you're just shining
natural and then and then this one is
really similar I just actually got this
when I was in California last week this
is the Josie Maran Argan enlightenment
and luminizing veil
I got it mainly for the packaging
because look how cute this is and it
says shine the light you were born to
shine Josie I love this this does have
little glitters in it but when you apply
it to the skin those glitters don't
really show up that mutton and I like it
if you're going for a natural look this
is the NARS blush in the shade reckless
now this is not a blush this is a
highlight this is what it looks like and
I typically do not like highlighters
that NARS comes out with I'm not a fan
of albatross albatross I'm just not a
fan of NARS highlights like I just feel
like they never get a right and I almost
disliked this one like I was almost
there like Oh Mars disappoint me again
but I just watched it on my hand at the
store and I was like what is this
majestic creature this is unlike any
highlighter I have and when I first got
it I hated it I hated it like I liked
how its watched but when I applied it to
my skin I was like absolutely not this
has glitter it's like pure glitter in it
and it has it's pink with like blue
glitters almost I don't know it's the
weirdest thing but when you have like a
bubble I am makeup look and you put like
matte show underneath this
and then put this on top the intensity
you get on your face is like no other
and you can kind of see the sparkle but
I like that when I'm going out like I
use this one if I'm like going somewhere
at nighttime only and it's like a party
or something because your face glows
I got Sparkle Queen this is the Sonia
Kashuk chic luminosity bronzer /
highlighter duo I got this at Target
recently and I love it I love it because
if you have dark skin tones you can use
the gold and if you're super fair you
can use like the pink and they're both
so nice the formula of this is amazing
so silky so buttery smooth I highly
recommend this because it's affordable
and when you mix it all together you get
like a pinky bronze color
so essentially you get three highlights
in one product so you save like a ton of
money there you have three highlights
and it's so so nice this is a
tried-and-true an oldie but a goodie
this is Mac MSF mineralized skinfinish
in soft and gentle this is the first
highlight I ever ever ever purchased
like a classic and it's actually like a
beautiful classic like man I need to use
this highlight more often because this
is one of the prettiest highlights I
have it has a marbling through it so you
get kind of like a gold iridescent but
kind of like a champagne there's a
little bit of pink in there it's just so
so beautiful and it's baked so I love
the formula I love baked product so I
really really recommend this one it's my
favorite one I Mac this out of all the
highlights I own out of all of them when
I'm wearing this one someone tells me
what is on your cheeks this is the Laura
Mercier matte radiance it's not matte
matte radiance baked powder highlight in
0-1 it's not matte it looks like this I
got this at IMATS so I got it for 40%
off so I scored a really good deal on it
this is so intense this is so glowy in a
non shimmery way there's a lot of
highlighters out there that are shimmery
and kind of accentuate your pores
or just kind of look like they're just
sitting on top of your skin this one is
so intense but it kind of makes your
skin look smoother than it is if that
makes sense I don't know and the formula
is just one of a kind it's baked so I
love it but because it's just pure glow
it's like a pure sheen no shimmer just
like up intensity it's it's gorgeous
my mom every time I wear is when she's
like I love that highlight and every
time I wear it and last drugstore one I
have this is actually a dupe for the
mary lou manizer by the balm this is the
baked bronzer in the shade Tiki and I
haven't used this in so long and I need
to use it again it's very very similar
to a mary lou manizer and it's more
affordable and it's just a really pretty
light gold you can you can go wrong it's
it's it's affordable and it's actually a
beautiful formula okay and then last but
not leave that's but not leave these are
the Becca shimmering skin perfectors
pressed in moonstone and moonstone and
opal this is what they look like if you
watch youtube videos everybody ends a
mama talks about this I feel like this
opened the doors for so many people when
it comes to highlighting like I feel
like a lot of people got obsessed with
highlighting because of Becca um
everybody loves opal like everybody's
favorite is opal but my personal
favorite is moonstone I think moonstone
is a little bit prettier a little bit
more intense and I see it more on my
skin opal has a little bit more of a
champagne finish and this one's more of
like a white gold which I love these are
so intense and these feel unlike any
other powder like out of all the
highlights I have these feel the
creamiest the buttery as' and the
beautifulest so I really really love
these these are an investment they're
pricey but they're so nice and actually
while I was in California Danny not me
Danny bought me rose gold and Tobi's
Danny purchase these for me while I was
in comfort because he wanted me to have
the whole collection I didn't feel a
need for these before because obviously
I'm fair and this is not
hi Leon my jiggle this show is not no
highlight on my cheekbone but this is a
great blush topper because it gives a
beautiful rose gold Sheen to your face
and this is amazing in the summertime to
just dust really lightly on your bronzer
to give you like a bronzy glow so the
formula on this the formula B's the
formula is so good that I mean they're
so good so yeah that completes this
video I know there were so many but
highlights are my weakness
just like everything I hope you enjoyed
this video and today we are going to
take another vote in the comments
