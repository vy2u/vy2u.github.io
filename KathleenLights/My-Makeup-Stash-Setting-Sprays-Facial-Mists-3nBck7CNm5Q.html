makeup stash video in my makeup / series
and today we are dealing with facial
sprays setting sprays face mists dewy
mists it's hard to categorize what you
totally know what I mean so I quickly
want to say please don't feel like you
need all of these I have so many setting
sprays and face mist because some of
them are sent to me in some I have
purchased and I've just accumulated so
many and it's actually a step in my
makeup routine that I really really
enjoy doing so I like to branch out and
try different ones but please please
please don't feel like you need all of
these or half of these or even less than
half of these I honestly would just
recommend like two one to really prolong
your makeup and then one is a like
refresher or like a powder setter or a
dewy kind of thing I don't recommend
that's it
that's pretty much all you need even one
you only really need one but a lot of
the ones that I have here actually do
different things so they serve different
purposes what are you in there I my
candle isn't on okay so I'm gonna get
started with like the primers or like
the makeup Preppers or whatever this is
the Smashbox photo finish primer water I
know what you're thinking I thought you
didn't like that but actually style
house sent this to me as a gift
um so I have it so I might as well keep
it and actually put it to use maybe I
did try it like twice a while ago and I
just thought it was fancy water I didn't
really see much of a difference but so
many people love it so I might put it to
the test again it's silicone free
alcohol free and oil free so it's good
for sensitive skin because it doesn't
have any of those ingredients but I
don't exactly know what it is about this
that Prime's your face like so many
people say because it's alcohol free so
I'm going to give this a go it's sitting
in my drawer so I'm gonna try it out I
will say that it doesn't have a bad
scent and I actually like how it sprays
it sprays a fine mist you know it's you
know it's good it's got a good spray
next one that I really do like and I
really do think that it Prime's my face
is the skin Danai via the makeup primer
spray this is oil free paraben free and
I like this a lot this actually does
have alcohol in it which
is what I find really grabs onto my
makeup and primes it and keeps it in
place so for that exact reason I only
use this when I want my makeup to last
like three days in a row or when it's
like so hot outside that I know I'm
gonna be sweating my arse off and I just
need my makeup to stay in place that's
when I use this because I do have
sensitive skin so I don't like putting
this on my face every single day it
doesn't break me out but so it does have
alcohol in it so I don't want to use it
every single day but I still love this
Scandinavia makes the best setting
sprays and you know sprays like this so
I really like this one last up in the
primer or first makeup step category it
what this is the urban decay b6 vitamin
infused complexion prep spray there is
something in my eye and it is bothering
me so bad so if I'm like throughout this
whole video that's why it says it's
redness reducing pore minimizing and oil
absorbing this is also made by skin de
Naevia so that's actually really really
awesome skin many of you and Urban Decay
do a lot of things together when it
comes to sprays and I actually have not
tried this this was sent to me by Urban
Decay and I haven't tried it to be
honest everybody was talking about this
when this first came out like everyone
on YouTube was using it and loving it
and then it just died down and nobody
uses it anymore
so I don't know if this is any good I
really love the packaging I love that
this is like a hot lime green it's kind
of pretty so I'm excited to try this out
because no one talks about it anymore
okay so now let's talk about the makeup
extenders like setting sprays for your
face that are actually made to make your
makeup to make your makeup last all day
I'm going to talk about these two babies
right here these are both from Urban
Decay these are the makeup setting
sprays this one is the chill one and
this one is the all-nighter so you can
see which ones do you think I like more
this one it's all finger print II and
this one's like nice and new I talked
about this one first really quick they
pretty much do the exact same thing only
I recommend this one for dry
I'm not saying oily skin can't wear this
but this one not only sets your makeup
so that it can last all day but also
gives you like a dewy finish it's very
very cooling
you put it on your face like that chill
setting spray you know like chill like
cold I really love that about this it's
oil free paraben free and it has temper
control technology all of these skins in
a via products this is in collaboration
with Scandinavia but all of the
Scandinavia products have that
temperature control technology so your
makeup doesn't really melt melt
can I speak today I will say that I find
that this one laughs even longer than
this though I don't know if it's because
it has a little bit of a dewy finish and
it's cooling and it's more refreshing
but even though this makes my makeup
last a long time
this one makes it last just a little bit
longer so this is the all-nighter it
says on the bottom long-lasting while
this one just says cooling and hydrating
so this one's definitely made for a more
long wear type of thing I also have a
little one that I bought like at the
checkout counter at Sephora because
these are great great products
especially if you want your makeup to
last all day I really really love these
this is model in a bottle this one is
the purple one which is for sensitive
skin it says sensitive skin formula
makeup setting spray with a matte finish
ah this is hairspray for your face I'm
not even joking I barely have used
anything I got this at IMATS like summer
months ago because this stuff is no
freaking joke I don't find it breaks me
out um I have sensitive skin that's why
I got this one
um this does have a ha outlet yeah this
is a alcohol in it by the way it's like
the first ingredient the other ones that
have alcohol it's not the first
ingredient this one is like the first
ingredient but I will say I will say if
you are a model or if you need your
makeup to last like literally like legit
24 hours this sets your makeup like
nothing like nothing does but it's so
you feel like your face almost feels
tight it the feeling goes away but as
soon as you spray this on your face is
like it's and for someone with dry skin
I don't necessarily love that feeling
but holy crap this is perfect like New
Year's Eve Thanksgiving Christmas when I
want my makeup to last all night yeah
it's even a lot more long
then this one and this one is long
lasting so I imagine and then I have the
regular skin danava Scandinavia have
everything skin - navel this whole video
these Scandinavia make up finishing
sprays these are the same thing but this
one says Bridal I don't exactly know
what the difference is skin today we
actually sent these to me I don't I've
never used the bridal one I don't know
what the difference is
anyway um these are amazing I do find I
don't know if it's just me but I find
that this is actually better than the
all-nighter
then the urban decay one I don't know
what it is but the regular skin the Navy
a sighting spray is just on their own
not in collaboration with urban decay
make my makeup last longer it or it just
doesn't fade as fast as those and don't
get me wrong all of these all of these
make my makeup last a really long time
as opposed to not using it at all but
this one makes it last a very very long
time this combination is bulletproof the
primer and the finishing spray is the
one I take with me though when I'm
traveling I don't take any other one I
just take this one when I'm in
California or whatever and I need and I
put on my makeup and I need it to last
all freaking day throw an event
nighttime this is the one that I take
with me it's awesome okay so we are
almost done I just have three more to
share with you I am done talking about
setting sprays now I'm just talking
about specifically like facial mists I
want to give a big shout out to mac fix+
this is like my read at that i love mac
fix+ because i use it for many different
things not only to apply to my face but
I use it on eyes shadow is all the time
as you know this is not the kind of
setting spray that's going to make your
makeup last all day but it is a setting
spray you can use as a setting spray and
what I mean is sometimes you go a little
bit too overboard with your powder or
your makeup looks a little bit cakey
like it's just too powdery you spray
this all over your face and it just
becomes one with the powder and your
face doesn't look powdery anymore it
just sets your makeup down not to make
it last all day but it sets it like deep
into the skin does that make sense yes
so yeah this is like the old packaging
now they look similar to this like a
frosted bottle I'm halfway through this
one and I have
used up a bottle before but I bought the
the coconut one when it came out it came
out like a limited edition and I also
bought the lavender one because I love
fix+
so much so when I saw that they came out
with limited edition scents about
coconut and lavender I love the scent of
lavender and Coca then this one is so
pricey oh my god this is the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist this is actually
be miss I sprayed all over my face when
I was done with my makeup and to be
completely honest I don't love using it
that way my favorite way to use this is
as a primer is a moisturizer in a spray
bottle to be completely honest with you
it doesn't feel like a mist it doesn't
feel like water that just evaporates and
absorbs this feels like a moisturizer I
put I spray this all over my face
especially before I do my makeup and my
skin looks so dewy so luminous I spoken
about this about a million times so I'm
not going to go on and on about it it
comes with a hefty price tag I purchased
this myself but I love love love it and
I definitely would purchase it again I
think it's well worth the money because
it's also like a skincare product
to be honest I love this it's so I got
dry skin that will be your best friend I
don't know if you will like it if you
have oily skin okay so my last product
isn't good alternative to that Tasha one
this is the Josie Maran
Nirvana hydrating treatment mist this is
what it looks like I have used it
non-stop and it's like not going down
like I mean it was full so I guess I
have purchased this recently and I was
just on Sephora and I purchased it on a
whim
wow I love this so much this technically
is a skincare product though it's not
meant to be like a finishing spray a
setting spray or anything like that this
is meant like for skincare you're
supposed to use this product right after
you clean your face like in the morning
or at night time right after you wash
your face you spray this all over your
face and then you wait till it like sets
and then you go in with the rest of your
skin care routine moisturizer eye cream
whatever so it's kind of like a skincare
step it's supposed to add a lot of
hydration a lot of moisture and I
believe it really really does but I use
it for
make up as well I do use this throughout
the day randomly if my face is feeling
really dehydrated I'm just like and I
spray it an instant instant moisture
comes to my skin my skin looks nice
healthy dewy and I feel very moisturized
but I also love using this on top of my
makeup I even like using this over my
makeup more than this one this one is
more lightweight this one is a little
bit thicker a little bit more
moisturizing a little bit heavier this
one is a little bit more lightweight so
as you can probably tell I don't have
anything from the drugstore to share
with you guys which I really hate that
you guys know I like to incorporate
drugstore products but I haven't found
any from the drugstore that I really
love to be completely honest with you
the only one that I have tried is the
elf setting spray and I don't like it so
I this is where you guys come in I want
you guys to comment below if there's any
facial mists from the drugstore not that
I need any more but I do want to
research more drugstore face masks to
maybe include them in videos for you
guys to give you other alternatives and
options so leave me comment down below
if you know a drugstore face mist that
you actually really love then you've
tried and really really loved so leave
me that comment down below yeah that
completes this video these are all my
setting sprays and facial mints yeah
anyway my next makeup stash video will
be on my eye shadow palettes that video
is going to be a long one because I have
so many pallets so that will be my next
eye makeup sex video thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye
mmm it says its redness reducing

that what is in my I don't so I'm not
cutting the grass great I can't even see
this

your face that are actually made to make
