really gloomy day outside it's been
raining all day so this is probably a
little dark right now like the Sun isn't
peeking through my windows so I'm sorry
about that can't go to the weather but
today I'm going to be sharing with you
my skincare routine my morning and night
skincare routine now a couple of people
had asked me to do this when I posted my
sultry eyes like makeup tutorial and at
first I didn't think I was going to do
it because I have like the simplest
skincare routine in the world but I
thought I'd go ahead and share with you
anyway because all the products I use I
actually really enjoy and they do help
out my skin a lot so maybe I can help
anyone else okay so I'm just gonna stop
rambling now really quickly though I do
want to say that I have dry skin it gets
extremely dry in the winter but in the
summertime like you know this time of
year it's more normal to dry I don't use
anything fancy in my skincare routine
when it comes to tools like I don't have
a Clarisonic I wish I did but it's kind
of expensive until now my fingers have
been working just fine so yeah and
nothing fancy to my skincare routine at
all so just the morning okay so now I'm
officially done talking so I will get
into my skincare routine now okay so
there are a lot of things I do in the
morning before I even start my skincare
routine before touch my skin to get
ready for the day like flossing talking
on the phone brushing my teeth you know
that sort of thing using mouthwash I do
a couple of things before I actually
start prep
for the day so the first thing I use is
Cetaphil this is the cleanser I use
every single morning and I really love
this cleanser because it's good for
sensitive skin everyone can use this
they even say it's safe to use on babies
it's really really gentle and I love it
it's one of those milky cleansers so
it's not going to foam up which is what
I like since I have dry skin washes that
foam up really dry out my face so I
basically just sit there for about two
minutes rub it into my face and then
wash it off and then after that I just
follow up with some moisturizer I didn't
show the bottle but I used the Cetaphil
daily moisturizer so I love using the
cleanser and the moisturizer I just
think that Cetaphil is a really good
brand especially if you have sensitive
skin it's amazing so I just add a thin
layer of that to my face and then I'm
ready for the day and that is all I do
in the morning simple I know
so I use a couple of more things at
nighttime and usually I will wash my
face in the shower just because the heat
of the water kind of opened my pores and
it just like washing my face in the
shower but for the sake of this video I
did it after my shower so basically I
just pick up my hair in a little top
knot just so that I don't get made wash
in my face and this isn't a skincare
item but I do take off my eye makeup
before I wash my face just because I
feel like even if I do wash my face with
a wash that gets all my makeup off I
still have some residue around my eyes
so I use the Neutrogena oil-free makeup
remover to take that off then I go in
with my purity made simple one-step
facial cleanser this is my Holy Grail
face wash it's amazing I put some on my
hand and then I add like a very thick
layer to my entire face I love this wash
again it's also one of those milky
washes that doesn't really foam up it
looks like I'm putting water on my face
right now you can't really see it but it
is really good for sensitive skin I
think and it's amazing because it takes
off every single trace of makeup on your
face it deep cleans and it makes your
skin feel amazing
the fact that it takes up all your
makeup and it really does clean your
pores you know helps you get rid of some
of your blackheads I just think it's an
overall amazing cleanser and I think
everybody should try it it's fabulous so
I'll just take about two minutes and
really rub it into my skin and then I
wash it off
you
and this is me admiring how soft and
amazing my skin feels after the impurity
face wash ok now I go in with toner now
I've never used a toner before this so I
can't tell you it's amazing but it is
the formula 10 point 0.6 so totally
clean toner and it is targeted for
sensitive skin and it doesn't have
alcohol so it doesn't dry out your face
so I use it with a cotton round and I
just add some all over my face I will
say that I do like it though it doesn't
dry out my skin and makes my skin feel
nice doesn't break me out and I feel
like it gets the job done so that's good
and then after of course I go in with my
moisturizer why do I keep forgetting to
show you the moisturizer I don't know
but I use the exact same moisturizer or
use in the daytime I use the Cetaphil
daily moisturizer I just use a lot more
of it so I just put a bunch of dots of
that all over my face and I rub it in I
don't have a different moisturizer for
nighttime just because I love the
Cetaphil one so much
so that's basically it and I'll just
take some Vaseline and rub it on my lips
I put vaseline on every single night
before I go to sleep on my lips not that
this has really anything to do with
skincare just wanted to add that because
it's really good for your lips and you
should try it out if you haven't and yes
that's basically all I do very simple
again I know don't know what I'm doing
here I almost forgot
hello I have to grab it I also use the
st. Ives green tea scrub in my skincare
routine I use this all the time this is
definitely a permanent part of my skin
regime it's just since I don't exfoliate
my face every day I didn't add that I
look a little crazy right now
I know sorry but this is the best scrub
I've ever found especially if you have
sensitive skin because it's very very
gentle and it's not abrasive at all so
if you're scared of exfoliators because
you're sure to like scratch your face
pick this one up it's really good okay
guys so that was it that was my skincare
routine like I said there's nothing too
special about it but these products do
really work for my skin so if you have
dry skin or sensitive skin or you know
just normal skin I think you might like
these products I don't know I hope this
helped you in some sort of way or at
least I hope you enjoyed watching this
