exciting video I'm so excited I'm so
excited I'm gonna be talking about my
eyeshadow palette in collaboration with
morphe if you guys are shocked right now
like this is the first time I'm hearing
about this you guys don't follow me on
social media I already spoke about it on
snapchat Twitter and Instagram so morphe
is a brand that i've been using for a
really really long time i remember i did
like a whole review on the morphe brand
i purchased everything myself i did like
a whole morphe video a long time ago
when morphe wasn't as big as it is now
and then now being here like right now
talking to you guys about this it just
blows my freaking mind okay my thoughts
are all over the place let me just let
me just get started
so morphe asked me to collaborate with
them on an eyeshadow palette and they
asked me to do this like a year and a
half ago and I know it's been way over a
year and this was actually supposed to
release like months and months and
months ago but it was pushed for like a
ton of different reasons but it was but
it is finally here now and it's so crazy
to me and before I get into swatches and
talking about this I do want to mention
that this palette releases tomorrow if
you are watching this video on Monday
when I posted it launches tomorrow
October 25th Tuesday October 25th I
believe it will launch 10:00 a.m.
Pacific Standard Time I think I might
have to double check on that and put it
down below so this is what the box looks
like I know morphe is one of those
brands that doesn't do like crazy things
with packaging they have very basic
standard packaging but I was able to
play around with how I wanted the box to
look and of course there's lights on the
box because I'm corny like that and it
just says kathleenlights palette there's
a picture of me on the back and like a
little little message to you guys you
know it's a box okay so this is what the
actual palette looks like you guys know
that on their palettes it just usually
says morphine but this one says morphe X
kathleenlights
I think it's so cool it's their normal
read font but it's like a metallic you
read and I love the packaging on this
palette not because it's like my ballad
or anything I just love the packaging on
this this is their standard
um morphe palettes they come in like the
plastic packaging and you know they like
open like this where it clicks shut that
is their standard packaging this one is
actually different this one actually has
a cardboard packaging it's not their
plastic packaging and it is a magnetic
palette so it like closes magnetically I
love that about this I have been using
this palette to travel with for months
every time I go somewhere I take this
palette and it's just so travel friendly
I love that I actually just busted this
open about a week ago because my old
palette I had been using it for months
and it was like a sample palette it
didn't even have the top up anyway
so I am going to be inserting swatches
but I'm also going to be swatching them
on the back of my hand so you can see
the pigmentation so this palette is
actually going to retail for $14.99 on
the morphe website and I also have my
10% off coupon code with morphe it's
just kathleenlights if you want to use
it and save 10% on the palette when I
heard how much the palette was gonna be
I was floored I was so excited I was
like my subscribers are gonna love this
because it's such an affordable palette
and it's so great it's just a palette
that a ton of people can get whether you
can afford it or not some people don't
like splurging on makeup so I love the
fact that this is affordable and I'm so
happy I got to put together a palette
that was accessible to so many people
these are the colors that are in the
palette now I got a lot of questions
like oh my gosh there's so many warm
shade why do you have so many warm
shades that palette looks like so
similar to so many things on the market
and yes of course I guess you're totally
right but it wouldn't have been a
cathleen palette if I didn't throw in
warm colors in this palette like I never
wear cool toned eyeshadows like rarely
do I wear them unless I'm doing a
specific cool tone look I love warm
shades so of course this little square
right here is just full warm shades so a
lot of people are confused in this
palette there's a mixture of eyeshadows
that morphe already owns in single
shadows kind of like the Jaclyn hill
favorites palette Jaclyn put together
all of her favorite morphe eye shadows
all of her favorite like single morphe
eyeshadows and put them all in one
palette and that was the Jaclyn hill
favorites palette this one has a lot of
single shadows by morphe as well but
some of these are
also from morphe palettes not just
single eyeshadows which I'll get into
and six of these are customized they let
me design six specific shades that were
exclusive to this palette so okay let's
get it to the swatches I know you guys
are like oh my god shut up just watch
okay so the first eyes shadow right here
is actually called cream puff I believe
it's one of their single eyeshadows and
is probably my favorite inner corner
highlight that morphe makes it reminds
me so much of Mac nylon this is what I
have on the inner corners of my eyes
right now oh by the way yeah everything
on my eyes right now is the is this
palette so this is this
that's so much coffee today that I feel
like I'm really crazy and I feel like
I'm gonna annoy myself while I edit this
video but just so excited so yeah that
first one is cream puffs let me swatch
it on the back of my hand so as you can
see it's a really pretty light
shimmering highlighting color like I
said this is what I have on the inner
corners of my eyes it's so brightening I
also have this mixed with another shade
underneath my brow bone because by
itself underneath the brow bone it's a
little bit too shimmery like it's a
little bit too much so I mixed it with
the color that's next to it I have my
wife's here I'm ready this next color is
just kind of like a basic highlighting
shade a matte highlighting shade it's a
creamy matte bone color it's pretty much
the exact color of my skin so underneath
the brow bone I like to mix it with this
one which is what I did today
but if you're a little bit darker than
me to like very deep this would be a
stunning brow bone highlight because
it's matte and really brightening on
those of you with like medium to deep
skin tones but if you're like me you can
mix it with the first one or if you're
very very very fair this would be
perfect to set your primer on your eye
like if you prime your lids and you want
that perfect like bone color to just set
down the primer this is perfect I use
that all the time all the time for that
you're probably not going to be able to
see this swatch because it is like my
same skin tone
but oh no it's a little bit lighter but
you can see right there did you even see
me swatching that or did i swatch that
off-camera like wha so yeah
this next shade is actually my favorite
Morphy crease color that they make it's
one of their single shadows and it's
called deep skin I knew immediately when
they asked me to create a palette that I
wanted this eyeshadow I have the single
eyeshadow in one of my Z palettes and
I've actually used it in a few tutorials
it's what I have in my crease right now
I just packed it on in my crease and it
gives such a beautiful warmth to any
look you're doing I love that light
orange a warm crease shade which is why
I definitely needed it in this palette I
love it in the pan it looks like it has
like little specks of gold glitter but
it does not translate on the eyes at all
it looks pretty intense there on the
hand like it might not work for you if
you are very very fair in the crease but
this color is so buildable if you apply
a really light hand in your crease even
if you are extremely fair you'll get
that perfect like beautiful orange
transition shade this next one is
actually a custom shade I wanted the
perfect gold eyeshadow and I love this
gold it is amazing it's so so beautiful
I love it because it has that hint of
orange eNOS just a little bit it's like
a little bit of gold a little bit of
orange just a very warm golden shade but
it looks so beautiful on the entire lid
and then the last one on the top row is
also a custom shade it looks very
similar to some of the eyeshadows in
like the 35o palette but it's also a
little bit different it's a cranberry
with a little bit of purple a little bit
of red I love it it kind of has like
more of a satin finish it's not super
metallic like this gold one so if you're
not into super intense metallic gold
eyeshadows this is just a little bit of
a step down I mean it's still shimmery
and beautiful but it's not like whoa
shiny metallic if that makes sense I
love the finish of this eyeshadow okay
so moving on to the second row this
color right here is actually a very cool
tone Brown I knew I wanted a cool tone
Brown just to balance out the palette
and surprisingly this Brown looks
beautiful no matter what look you do a
cool tone look a warm tone look I
this brown every single time I grab this
pallet even when I'm doing just everyday
simple looks I'll grab a little bit of
this in my crease a little bit of this
in the outer corners and I'm done I'm
good to go I'm out the door
this is actually a morphe single
eyeshadow and I believe the name of it
is trouble I'm actually wearing this
eyeshadow in my crease a little bit and
on the outer corners as well I didn't
film a tutorial on this look but
definitely let me know if you want to
see a tutorial on this look so I have
this on the outer corners and in my
crease I have mostly the black shade
right at the outer corners but I did
layer it on top of this Brown and I
added some of that in the crease this
next color is so beautiful and every
time I look at it it reminds me of prom
like this is the kind of eye shadow I
would wear to prom but this is actually
an eyeshadow that morphe has in their 35
t palette one of my favorite morphe eye
shadow palettes I have a tutorial using
that palette love it this is such a
pretty like purpley topi silvery kind of
eyeshadow depending on what eye shadows
you use with it it can let go either way
if you use a lot of purple colors in
your crease this will lean very very
purple but if you use a lot of light
cool tones and Silver's it will kind of
look a little bit silver a little bit of
pinky toe penis in there to really
really love this color this is perfect
for just everyday throw it all over your
lid this next one is also a custom color
it's just like a basic bronze shade this
is the color I have all over my eyes
today this is like the main shadow on
the lid I do have a black base
underneath I put like a chubby black
eyeliner all over my lid and then I went
over it with this bronze shade because I
feel like this bronze color layered on
top of black looks so beautiful and
smoky so that's what I did today but I
wanted like my perfect bronze that
wasn't too warm or anything and this is
the color I came up with so so pretty I
mean it's definitely a warm bronze but
there's like a little bit of toe penis
in there I don't know I'm not am I crazy
I really love this shade as you guys
know so I'm going to say that for
everything this next one is another
custom color I wanted something that was
similar to this but much lighter because
I wanted to cranberry shades but one
deeper for like the outer corners and
then one that was perfect for the crease
so this is the one
i customized i love it it is like a
purple cranberry shade but if you are a
little bit deeper than me kind of like
medium to deep skin tones this would be
a perfect transition shade and yeah so
pretty you see it's not too dark like
this is totally transitional you know
and then the last one in this row is a
really beautiful deep cranberry shade it
is matte just like this one but it's a
little bit darker it's actually one of
their single eyeshadows and it's called
secretive one of my favorite single
eyeshadows from morphe I have one in my
Z palette and I use it all the time well
now I use this one all the time love it
I love this shade like I could bathe in
this shade I love it on the outer
corners of like any look okay so now we
got to the bottom row which is probably
the more fun row it has it has more of
the like out there more bold kind of
colors this first one right here is
another custom shade I wanted a really
deep almost dirty green like when you
look at it like oh yeah that's a green
but almost like a muddy green it's not
like whoa green eyeshadow this one is
like wall green eye shadow this one is
much more wearable but still has that
beautiful like emerald undertone so
stunning so perfect for fall beautiful
all over the lid on the outer corners on
the lower lash line it's just I love it
this next one is the last custom color
in this palette it is a really intense
vibrant green so many people were thrown
off by this shade they're like why would
you include that like nobody would wear
that and I disagree I think it's
beautiful I know I've said in the past
that I don't love green eyeshadow but I
don't love bean eyeshadow on me I think
green eyeshadow looks beautiful on
everybody with brown eyes or people with
blue eyes whatever I just feel like
green eyeshadow looks so weird against
my eye color but I love you now shadow
on everybody else it's one of my
favorite colors I loved it and I wanted
a super metallic Irish green I know it's
so strange but I don't know it's what my
heart wanted and I definitely got to
initiate it's so metallic and beautiful
look at the it's look at dates oh my
gosh oh my gosh
my god that is stunning that is so so
beautiful there's such a nice reflection
to this eyeshadow and actually my
favorite way to use this green eyeshadow
is in conjunction with this one these
two layered with each other let me see
let me swatch it for you like the dark
green and then this green on top like oh
my gosh I love it it gives it kind of
like a more deep emerald look so I'm so
happy I included this shade even though
it's a little bit out there people were
a little bit confused
it would also look beautiful on its own
on the lower lash line
kind of like a pop of color so as you
guys know the 35o palette is one of my
favorite palettes of all time I love the
3500 because it's full of like warm
colors and oranges these two eyeshadows
are actually in the 3500 I just couldn't
help myself
I love the 3500 so I'm not I don't know
their names cuz they're like in palettes
this color is so similar to Mac Brown
script if you're familiar with that
eyeshadow it's like a really beautiful
matte warm reddish brown this one is so
so similar and so smooth so special so
smooth so much coffee so this is what it
looks like I know a very typical warm
reddish brown but those kind of
eyeshadows are essential to me and then
this eyeshadow is another must-have for
me another favorite of mine when more if
you ask me to collab on a palette I knew
that I wanted this eyeshadow in the
palette and it's so similar to like my
favorite Bobby brown eyeshadow ever
which is called camel if you're familiar
with that I used to talk about that
eyeshadow all the time they're like
almost the exact same and camel is like
$20 for one eyeshadow it's like a baby
vomit but in the best way look at that
tell me that's not a stunning quark
camel kind of matte brown I love it so
much
beautiful beautiful beautiful
and then the last I shadow in this
palette is just their standard black
eyeshadow it's called Kohl I believe
it's one of their single eyeshadows I
wanted a matte black in this palette
because I feel like um matte black eye
shadows are essential for every day or
at least for me whenever I travel with a
palette I'm like
I wish there was a matte black in here I
always like to add just a little bit of
it to the outer corners or if especially
if I'm doing a really smoky look I feel
like a black is necessary for more
nighttime looks I really love adding a
black and I wanted to make this palette
like perfect to travel with so yeah
those were swatches of the palette I
know it's kind of like a simple palette
nothing too crazy about it but I mean
it's me I'm so simple I feel like this
palette is perfect it describes me
perfectly and I love it so much and I
hope you guys do too I've been reading
your comments on Instagram and you guys
seem really really excited so it makes
me so excited to see how happy you guys
are especially because it's 1499 I will
be posting tutorials using this palette
obviously just in case you guys do pick
it up if you want to follow along to
like certain tutorials on my channel and
we can like do our makeup together you
can grab it and then I'll grab it and
then I'll do it on my camera and then we
could like do it together it's like
we're doing our makeup together but a
lot of people were saying that they were
kind of a bum that there is no mirror
but I actually like that there's no
mirror especially with cardboard
packaging if it was plastic I would have
liked a mirror but I break my mirrors so
easily I really do but also the value of
the palette would have had to go up if
there was a mirror and I really wanted
to keep it affordable so that is why yes
oh this is limited edition I completely
forgot sales we're getting this for you
this is limited edition once it sells
out it sells out if it does even sell
out I don't know I have no idea how this
is gonna go my makeup geek palette is
also limited edition by the way my
highlighting palette would make a geek I
know that my lip collabs have kind of
lingered and they were limited editions
but they've kind of stayed around like
my color pop one and my ofer one but
this one is limited edition like it
really is yeah aside from that I do want
to mention that this is probably my last
collab for a while I'm working on some
personal things some personal projects
that I cannot discuss right now that
don't have anything to do with other
brands it's like personal things I'm
doing I know so many people were like my
gosh Kathleen you are a collab whore you
are collabing with everyone and I'm
sorry if that offends you but I love
collab
with people that I love and I love the
people like colour-pop I love the people
that Oprah I love Marlena and I love
morphine just to help create a simple
little palette it was just so fun to
help them come up with this palette so
it's so nice thank you morphe like I
really appreciate that I love them so
much and thank you guys for making this
possible because if it wasn't for you

possible it's so crazy how I started off

from Mississippi so I just wanted
