a quick simple little video I just
wanted to sit down and chat with you
guys about the new Aquarius additions we
made at colour-pop I know most of you
already know because I did give the lip
swatches on snapchat and I spoke all
about this on Twitter and Instagram but
I know there's a lot of you that don't
follow me on social media and that only
follow me here on YouTube so I wanted to
give you guys the chance CDs because I
haven't even spoken about them at all on
YouTube so basically if you don't
already know I extended my aquarius
range with colour-pop I had the Aquarius
lipstick for over a year now
when did I release these I think it was
last December I don't really remember
but this is what it looks like you guys
have seen how Querrey it's about a
million times already I would say out of
all the lippie stix I've created I think
Aquarius is my favorite and I feel like
I'm betraying Lumiere by saying that
because Lumiere is like the love of my
life but my favorite color to wear is
Aquarius I just I could put this on with
absolutely any makeup look I've gone
through more of aquarius's than I have
of Taurus and Lumiere I keep one in my
purse at all times one here in my room I
just love it and then when colour-pop
released their ultra glossy lips ever
since they released those I was like
well Aquarius would look so beautiful as
a lip gloss or at least a similar tone
to Aquarius like it would look so pretty
as a gloss and color pop seems to really
agree they don't have any gloss in their
collection that really looks like
Aquarius or that was that tone they have
fairy floss which is a nude and then
they have a couple of other shades that
would be considered nude but nothing
really like Aquarius so I got a call
from my friend Jordan at colour-pop and
she was like okay how would you like to
release Aquarius and lip gloss version
for your birthday which of you guys
don't know my birthday is January 27th
I'm an Aquarius penspinning and I was
like absolutely I would love that and
then they had the idea to actually
release a trio they wanted to do
Aquarius in an ultra glossy lip in an
ultra satin lip and in an ultra matte
lip I was so excited but then I was like
wouldn't it be weird to launch a satin
lip and a matte lip of the same color
like that would be kind of odd and I was
like no no each color like all three
colors will be a little bit different so
the satin lip doesn't look like
the matte lip and it doesn't look like
the lip gloss you know they're all just
slightly different so I thought that was
a freaking amazing idea and these are
the shades I came up with and I'm going
to show you all three of them watched on
my lips right now I do want to quickly
mention that these are currently
available if you want them I will link
the colour-pop website down below you
can buy them individually for six
dollars each or you can buy the trio for
15 dollars so if you buy the trio you do
save three dollars not much I know but
if you were planning on buying all three
of them anyway you can get them for 15
dollars instead of 18 so that's pretty
cool and if you do get it in the trail
it comes in like a really cute little
box it's like pink like a similar color
and it says aquarius on it is so cute
but anyway enough of that so I know I
spoke to you guys about not collabing
for a while and that is very true in
some sense I am taking a break from
collab in general but with colour-pop I
just never really know they were the
first companies ever believed in me
think I had like 200,000 subscribers
when I launched Lumiere and I have such
a strong relationship with them nothing
I don't with the other brands s collab
with but with them I have so many
products and I don't know it might
expand in the future but when it comes
to like other brands and venturing out
with other brands I've never tried
before like I am taking a break from
collabs
in that sense okay anyway with that
being said let's get started on the
colors I know there's only three but I'm
going to show you some lip swatches and
another talk to you guys about them so
the first one is the ultra glossy lip
this one is also named Aquarius the only
one that's not named Aquarius is the
ultra matte lip and that one is named
Aquarius - it's the one that's the most
different from Aquarius all the other
ones are very similar but that one is
just a little different so that one is
Aquarius - all the other ones they're
still called Aquarius so this one is
Aquarius and it's the old truck glossy
lips I'm actually wearing it on my lips
right now this is the only thing I got
on the lips low meat a low heat so when
I first started testing out the ultra
glossy lip in Aquarius I wanted a sheer
finish just because my favorite ultra
glossy lip they have is called fairy
floss and it's a sheer finish and all
the other ones that I love that are
sheer finishes I thought that this for
sure would be a sheer finish but the
more I played around with it the more I
felt like it was just lacking something
so I told them to send it to me in a
finish which is still the same amount of
gloss it's still the same amount of
shininess but the creme finishes have a
little bit more pigmentation so they're
more full coverage and you just see the
color a lot more so once I tried it out
in a crime vanish I was like okay this
is perfect so here it is and a crime
finish I think it's such a beautiful
color very similar to the lippie stix
but a little bit more rosy a little bit
deeper I would say not deeper but
slightly slightly more rosy I love it
because it's very pigmented that you can
wear it on its own like I am right now
or you can layer it on top of a lipstick
it looks really nice on top of like
really deep lip liners very pretty color
I didn't want anything that was too nude
so one is something a little bit more
wearable so this is the color right here
and I love it if you guys want to see
what the original courious looks on me
I'll insert a clip right now I wanted to
show you Aquarius also like the original
just in case you didn't know what it
looked like or just in case you wanted
to refer back to that color versus the
other ones on my lips oh and I also want
to make a point that they don't have
anything in the collection that looks
exactly like this I was like blowing up
Jordans phone I was like are you sure
you don't have anything like this I was
watching all my color pop stuff on my
hands obviously I don't own every single
matte lip or every single set in list
because I've given some away to my
friends and stuff so even though it
didn't really match anything I had here
or the gloss even I wanted to make sure
that there was nothing in their line
that match this so Jordan would send me
like swatches up and down her arms this
next to all of their glosses with the
satin next to all of their other statins
and the same with the maps so we double
checked and we triple check that nothing
really looks like this next up is the
ultra satin list and I have to say it's
my favorite I mean you guys probably saw
it coming up my favorite lip formula
colour-pop create is the satin lip
because it's like a liquid lipstick but
it has more of a satin finish so it's
just I don't know I can load the family
I love them and this is Aquarius ultra
satin lip I love it so much it's
actually very similar to the lippie stix
this is definitely as close as it gets
the only difference I would say
obviously besides the finish they're not
going to look exactly the same because
Aquarius lippy stick has a cream finish
and there's a little bit of a shine to
it versus this it has more of a satin
finish and there really isn't a shine at
all but besides that I would say the
Aquarius satin lip is a little bit more
peachy I love this new color so much and
I think it was Paris own eye
see with really dark intense smoky eyes
is so feminine and pretty satin lip is
my number one and last but not least is
the ocean matte lip this is Aquarius too
and this one is also similar to the
lippy stick don't get me wrong it's just
a little bit more cool toned and it is a
little bit darker I feel like this is a
color a lot of people would really
really love just the undertone on
everything I feel like this is something
a lot of people are going to like on the
colour-pop website Aquarius - it's
actually described as a male nude and I
totally agree with it I wouldn't
consider this a mall it's very much like
a light pinky nudes but there is some
Bobbi next to it I love it I think it's
like a cute little twist to Aquarius I
tweaked them a little bit and I hope you
guys really really like the colors and
level Korea so much for those of you
with deeper skin tones I know you might
not love Aquarius maybe you'd be more
interested in Lumiere or Taurus
those look really beautiful on deeper
skin tones along with Lumiere 2.0 and
November I love how those look on these
skin tones as well I just wanted to
create something that was like my
perfect nude and I hope that some of you
like it as well thank you guys so much
for the love and support when I have
tweeted that I wanted Aquarius and a
gloss you guys were like yeah I want
that too you know I you guys make me
feel so awesome thank you for inspiring
me and makes me want to create stuff and
have fun with stuff speaking of which
I'm wearing a new kale polish color on
my nails I have been getting a few
questions what kale polish is if you're
new to my channel I created my own nail
polish brand so weird saying that I'm a
brand owner so weird and it's just
strictly nail polish I have a nail
polish addiction and I love it I will
link my care polish website down below
where I write like my nail information
and this is my newest color it's coming
out very very soon I created this color
to celebrate me turning 25 so I wanted
something like glittery and fun it will
be limited edition of my other shades
are not limited edition some of them are
sold out they should be restocking very
soon but those are not limited edition
you can get them whenever this will be
limited edition though a lot of you guys
already know what it's named you guys
have caught on to my little hints that I
split out so you guys already know the
name of it another thing I wanted to
mention before I end this video is a lot
of you guys were asking me if I could
film a tutorial for the look I was
running my last video which is my
favorites video let me know in the
comments
I know you're ready let me know in that
video but if you really want to see its
true on that look I think I might film
that tomorrow I think it would be nice
for Valentine's Day I'll just change the
lip color or I'll show you like two lip
options so yeah what else I want to say
I wanted to take time in this video to
sit and talk to you guys and now I can't
think of what else I wanted to say I
guess my week so yeah thank you guys so
