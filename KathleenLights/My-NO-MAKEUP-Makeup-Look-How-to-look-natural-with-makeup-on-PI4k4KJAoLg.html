the makeup I usually wear whenever I
want to look as natural as possible
which sometimes doesn't really make
sense because if you wear makeup you're
not natural or you don't look natural
but there is a way where you can wear
makeup and still look as natural as
possible and still feel natural and not
feel like you have tons of makeup on so
that's what I did today I kind of show
you step-by-step what I do to achieve
the no makeup makeup look and I hope you
find it helpful and if you want to see
how I do it then keep watching okay
so as you can probably tell I'm not
wearing any makeup at all
um I'm not going to put any foundation
on because when I think of no makeup
makeup I usually think of something
that's not so heavy on my face you know
something that's really natural and
lightweight and I know with a lot of
people foundation can tend to feel a
little heavy and yeah so I'm not doing
that so we're really going to be
concentrating on is concealer and
finishing powder so as you can tell I
have like really bad under-eye circles
I have discoloration on my nose it gets
really really red right here
I have like these red spots in between
my eyebrows and I don't know if you can
tell on camera but I have like um dark
spots around my mouth and stuff I just
usually have a lot of discoloration so
whenever I have really big pimples
I usually go ahead and use the hard
candy glamoflauge glamoflage concealer
but since I'm not really dealing with
really bad breakouts right now I'm just
going to give everyone skip that because
that's a really really heavy full
coverage concealer I'm just gonna go
ahead and use my Maybelline fit me and
I'm just gonna dab that in the areas
where I feel like I need concealing so I
keep looking in the viewfinder so yeah
I'm just gonna dab that around here cuz
this is where it gets really really red
I'm just gonna put some on in the middle
of my forehead down my nose here because
I get
really red blotchy areas throughout the
day on my nose just around my mouth yeah
and I'm just going to blend that in
I love this concealer it blends like a
dream
really does
just gonna try to spread that out a
little bit here cuz I tend to get really
read like no matter what I do I touch my
face and I get really red just by
touching my face I have a really
sensitive face okay now for my heavy
under-eye circles I'm just using my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser and I'm just gonna put
some of that let me crank this up my
broke so it's really hard to twist just
going to add some of that under my eyes
and you always kind of want to use a
brighter consider for under your eyes
just so that it doesn't make you look
dull and it brightens that area out so
I'm just blending it with my fingers you
can use a brush but I feel like fingers
work a lot more when it comes to
blending under your eyes just use like
all my fingers okay so after I blend
that out I'm just going to put a little
bit of concealer on my eyelids usually
we're just go ahead and use an eyeshadow
primer but since I'm not really doing a
full-blown I look I'm just going to use
concealer because I do have a lot of
veins on my eyelids I don't know if you
can tell but they are baby so I'm just
going to add a tiny bit on my eyelids
just to kind of even out the skin on my
eyes a little bit and this also works as
a primer if you don't have one
now I'm going to take some of that and
I'm just going to add it on the very
outside here I have like the very first
stages of crow's feet or something I
feel like I already have like fine lines
and it's really dark right here on my
eyes drives me crazy so I'm just adding
a little bit of concealer just to cover
that up okay so once you've done that
you are going to set your concealer with
a powder now my advice is to go with a
powder that's really really natural not
heavy on your skin because you want to
look as natural as possible
um I'm using my Mac skin finish natural
my mineralized skinfinish natural this
in the color medium and this is just a
really lightweight really natural powder
and I'm just going to put that all over
my face this kind of also just you know
evens out your skin tone now no matter
if you're doing a full face crazy
dramatic look or if you're going for
something more natural like this you
should always fit in your eyebrows now
I'm not going to go too crazy and do
such hard chiseled lines because this is
a more natural look but I am going to
fill them in I'm going to brush through
them
I'm gonna use my little Anastasia
spoolie and I'm just going to brush them
now let me just say that the lady who
does my eyebrows is in Miami which is
where I grew up and where I lived but I
don't live there anymore so I mean she
does my eyebrows as often as I go down
to visit my family but I haven't been
down in a couple of months actually no I
was down there last month it's just my
eyebrows grow really fast okay sorry
about that my car my camera just told me
that it had no memory left it's like
carful code change that high anyway like
I was saying my eyebrows they're just
not at its full potential right now I
apologize
for that anyway I just take an angled
brush like this and I I always always
use the color book from The Naked
palette and I'm just gonna just fill my
eyebrows really lightly and naturally
I'm not trying to do anything too
dramatic with my eyebrows today
okay so as you can see it's just more
defined and filled in more as opposed to
having you know some splotchy baldie
there is in my eyebrow so now I'm just
going to fill in my other eyebrow
okay so once I filled in my eyebrows and
for some reason my eyebrows look a
little scary on camera like they look
really dark but they don't look like
that in your life anyway so I'm just
going to go ahead and put a little bit
of color in my eyes I'm only using one
eyeshadow and I'm going to go into the
naked color in the Naked palette and I'm
just going to go in with my Mac 217 and
I'm just going to pop this into the
crease and I'm also going to put it on
the rest of my lid
I usually use buk in my crease for
everything I use book for everything but
since I want it a little bit more
natural I'm using this naked color which
is a couple of shades lighter I'm just
going to take a pencil brush and I'm
gonna put that on my lower lash line as
well this is a sigma e30
so yeah I don't want to use a shimmery
highlight prettiest I talk just like all
of my stuff anyway just I'm not going to
use a shimmery highlight so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take my
Anastasia matte highlighter it's like
this little pen marker type thing that
came with my brow is this shirt yeah and
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to use this kind of brighten up my eyes
so I'm going to put this under my brow
bone and I'm going to blend that my
fingers
and I'm going to take that into my tear
duct
and I'm going to drag it down a little
bit this really just makes you look
healthy and bright and brightens up the
look a little bit since you know you
want it to look like you're not really
wearing makeup putting a shimmery
highlight or something on a lot of Sheen
it's just going to be a little bit too
much I'm also going to take that and I'm
going to line my waterline with it just
to make my eyes appear bigger and
brighter next I'm gonna use my mascara
and I'm just gonna I'm gonna use my
winter Wild mega volume mascara and I'm
just gonna apply my mascara
I didn't curl my lashes today because I
didn't want something so dramatic so
usually my curl holds throughout the day
and I'm just gonna put it on my bottom
lashes as well okay so after I've
applied my mascara I just like to add a
little bit of bronzer to my face I
already started and then I realized that
my camera wasn't recording so I'm just
going to use my NYC bronzer in sunny and
I'm not going to use blush at all trying
to keep this as natural as possible I
feel like I've said natural in this
video like 50 times already but that is
the point of this video um yeah so I'm
just gonna follow the contours of my
face without really contouring you know
without using like a contour brush like
this I'm just using a brush like this it
just kind of give me like a sheer a so
after I've added a little bit of bronzer
to my face just to kind of warm up my
face um I'm pretty much done all I'm
gonna be doing is adding some chapstick
I'm a huge lipstick lover but if you
want something really really natural and
you don't want to use lip gloss either
because you don't like the feel of lip
gloss you don't like to like your hair
to get stucked or whatever just um apply
a chapstick that has a bit of a sheen to
it or just some color or like a Revlon
lip butter or anything that's like
moisturizing and natural
that's not something so dramatic so I'm
using my little blistex that I
absolutely love it gets like a like a
sheen to the lips that's usually what I
go for whenever I wear I do something
that's really natural like this I just
add some chapstick I don't know if you
can tell but it does have like a little
bit of a glossy shimmer okay so that is
it this is my no makeup makeup look this
is what I go for whenever I want to look
decent but I don't want to look like I'm
really wearing a lot of makeup I hope
this was helpful for you and it kind of
shows you a way that you can wear makeup
but still look really natural at the
same time thanks for watching and please
