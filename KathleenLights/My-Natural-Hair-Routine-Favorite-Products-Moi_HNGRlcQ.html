my natural hair routine I'm gonna be
sharing some of my favorite haircare
products with you guys whenever I leave
my hair natural like it is today I have
a ton of haircare products that I really
really really like but these are the
ones that I've been using recently
especially whenever I leave my hair like
curly or wavy I actually used to have
really really curly hair when I was
younger it was like Shirley Temple curls
I had Carla curly hair but from so many
years of ironing my hair I lost a lot of
my curls I have been straightening my
hair since sixth grade
I used to hate how it was I just wanted
straight hair so from the age of like 11
and 12 to like I was 20 I had my hair
straight at all times
but now I leave my hair natural all the
time and I'm gonna be sharing with you
some of the products that I really love
I have a very simple haircare routine
when it comes to my natural hair and I
keep saying when it comes to my natural
hair because there are products that I
really really love that are not in this
video because I prefer them when I am
straightening my hair there are certain
things I like in my hair when it's
straight but weigh my hair down or just
don't look good when it's not straight
so the first thing I want to talk about
actually don't have with me right now
how do I lose an entire tub of coconut
oil I don't know but I did I have no
idea where my coconut oil is but I would
highly highly highly recommend you guys
doing a coconut oil mask before you wash
your hair if you have curly hair wavy
hair straight hair puffy or whatever I
noticed a huge difference in the texture
of my hair when I give it a good coconut
oil mask I don't do this every time I
wash my hair but I like to do it every
other time I'm not someone who washes my
hair on a daily basis I do shower on a
daily basis but I do wash my hair like
every 3 to 4 days that may seem gross
for a lot of people but I have very dry
hair and if I washed my hair every
single day it would just get extremely
dry and you would just strip it of its
natural oils so I like to hold off on
washing it so yes I definitely recommend
using coconut oil the way that I like to
use it I will take like a scoop like a
handful and I will put it in the
microwave for like 10 seconds nothing
too long coconut oil actually melts
really fast even in the palm of your
hands coconut oil will melt
and I will just run that from the roots
all the way to the ends of my hair I'll
leave that in my hair for about three
hours and then I will take a shower and
wash my hair and whenever I do a coconut
oil mask I make sure to wash my hair
twice because sometimes I will find that
the coconut oil will leave a little bit
of a residue if I only shampoo my hair
once so I make sure to shampoo twice and
then the coconut oil is completely gone
but I still have a nice thick healthy
feeling to my hair so then after that I
will just go ahead and wash my hair my
ultimate favorite shampoo whenever I
know I'm gonna leave my hair naturally
wavy or curly like this is the we dad I
believe does how you say that brand I'm
not positive hooey death hi dad
ultra nourishing cleansing oil replenish
natural oils without greasiness like I
said earlier I do have very dry hair my
hair is chemically treated so I need all
the moisture I can get and this shampoo
does that for me it cleanses my hair
without stripping my hair I will only
use this shampoo if I'm not
straightening my hair because when I am
gonna iron my hair there is a different
shampoo that I use because although this
doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy it
does leave it very moisturized so if I
straighten my hair after using this
shampoo it will get just a little bit
greasy at the roots quicker than when I
use a different shampoo but when I want
to leave my hair naturally curly and
wavy like this this shampoo is amazing
I'm trying really hard to eliminate
products that have silicone in them not
that silicone is necessarily bad for
your hair but it kind of just coats your
hair and it doesn't really nourish it I
feel like that ingredient is thrown in
products just to throw you off and make
your hair feel nice but not doing much
to repair it and this does have DeMatha
cone in it but I just love it so much
with this shampoo I make sure that I
really get down in there and I scratch
and scrub my fingers throughout my roots
so that I make sure it's cleaning my
hair like it's supposed to I love this
if you guys have a recommendation for a
really good hydrating shampoo that works
really well with curly hair but doesn't
have silicone in it leave it in the
comments down below and I will check it
out so after I shampoo my hair I will go
in with a conditioner I'm someone who
does not like actual conditioners
I guess because my hair is so dry and
the fact that I wait three to four days
before I wash my hair I always use a
hair mask as a conditioner my favorite
hair mask ever whether I leave
her natural aura straightness is the
living proof restore mask treatment for
dry or damaged hair I like a lot of hair
masks but what I like about this one is
that I I can tell a difference in my
hair I feel like it is restoring my hair
as it's conditioning it maybe that's
just in my mind but a lot of hair masks
will just feel like they're silky or
will just coat your hair this I feel
really really gets down and conditions'
my hair I love the feeling of my hair
after I use this and I have gone through
a couple of these I will always go back
to this I've been using it for a while
now I like to focus this hair mask
towards the end of my hair well I
actually do bring it up to like around
my ears I conditioned the majority of my
hair but I definitely 100% keep it away
from my roots and I'll do other things
in the shower while I'm letting the
conditioner sit in my hair so I'll wash
my face wash the rest of my body I'll
shave my legs shave other parts of my
body my fat toe I'll take like a full-on
shower and then I will rinse my hair I
find this makes an incredible difference
because if I just put on conditioner and
then I just immediately rinse it away I
wouldn't really see results I definitely
recommend letting it sit in your hair
for a couple of minutes before you wash
it out and then that's all I will do in
the shower I do want to mention really
quick cuz I forgot to say this a little
while ago when I leave my hair natural
brushing my hair gets my hair literally
this big brushing out your curls will
just like destroy them and I have very
frizzy hair so I rarely ever brush my
hair throughout the day I do every once
in a while and I explain that in a
second but what I like to do is I will
brush my hair completely right before I
hop into the shower so right before I'm
about to wash my hair I will take my wet
brush I'll detangle my hair it gets
about this big and then I will jump into
the shower and wash my hair because
adding water to your curls kind of like
reactivates them so brushing your hair
right before you're about to wash it is
the way to go that way you get all of
the tangles out and then you don't have
to brush it right when you get out of
the shower and then obviously since I'm
washing my hair like every three to four
days I have to brush it at some point
because my hair gets knotted so easily
like I fart and my hair gets super
tangled so I recommend something like
this this will be your best friend if
you have wavy or curly hair this is only
a dollar
nine I got this at the dollar store I
believe but it's just basically one of
those you know Bello Guerra things I
just fill mine up with water and this is
what I use whenever I want to like
detangle my hair so I'll just kind of
spray this all over my hair from root to
ends not too much I just want to get it
a little bit damp and then I'll go in
with like a comb and get out the tangles
without really disturbing the curls this
is not the comb I use and this is also
not the comb I recommend I recommend a
wide toothed comb but of course I can't
find mine anywhere I don't know what I'm
doing with my things but that is what I
recommend I don't know why I grab this
one just to show I don't know okay so
once I get out of the shower my routine
is very very simple I don't like to put
too many products into my hair because
it will weigh my hair down and I don't
love the feeling of hair products in my
hair thanks for example let me know if
you're the same or if I'm the only one I
love dry shampoo but I use dry shampoo
to soak up the oils in my hair oh maybe
I should show you my favorite but anyway
like I was saying I love using dry
shampoo but I go for the ones that
really soak up the oils since I don't
wash my hair everyday I'm just trying to
get the grease enos out of my hair I'm
not someone who loves dry shampoos for
the texture and the grit and the volume
that's not really my style because I
don't love that feeling I feel like
everyone loves texturizers but they
drive me crazy
and my favorite dry shampoo is actually
pretty pricey I'm totally going off
course I know I was getting out of the
shower but I kind of jumped a couple
days after and I'm talking about my
favorite dry shampoo hope you don't mind
this is probably the most I've ever
spent on a dry shampoo but it's the one
that I love the most I really love this
this is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana
Black dry shampoo I don't love the white
one because I don't love the scent of
the white one this dry shampoo doesn't
all for me which is why I feel like it's
worth the price the steep price tag but
I feel like it's worth it because it
makes my hair look so clean it really
does a great job of sucking up all the
oils the only thing I don't love is that
it does leave a white cast it sprays out
white which on somebody with my hair
color it really shows up but with a lot
of judging and shaking
get that white powder eNOS out of your
hair so I mean it's not too bad but I
would love it if they came out with like
a brunette one I doubt it but I would
like that so I feel like it does what
it's supposed to do it really sucks up
my hose and it smells amazing it smells
exactly like the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana black perfume and it stays in my
hair like I'll put this on and if I see
my mom or someone later on throughout
the day they will compliment how my hair
smells okay back to what I was saying
earlier so once I get out of the shower
my hair care routine after this is so
simple I don't like to tell will dry my
hair with just a regular towel I will go
in with this towel right here this is
from the brand diva curl I bought this
on the Sephora website because I had
really good reviews and I love this I
feel like this really dries my hair
really fast without making it too frizzy
sometimes I feel like regular towels
will make my hair extra frizzy this
doesn't do that so whenever I'm drying
my hair I will always dry it with this
gray diva curl towel I love it
so much definitely recommend you
checking this out if you have curly hair
I will always go in with this product
right after a good shampoo and
conditioning this is the brioche yo I
don't know if you say it Breo Ryoji o or
brioche oh this is their rose Arkell
milk reparative leave-in conditioning
spray for weak and damaged hair it says
repairs hydrates and strengthens has
rosehip Argan and coconut oils that's
why it's called rose Arkell I just shake
this up really good make sure everything
it's like combining in this bottle and
then I will kind of put a generous
amount of this all over my hair I don't
focus this product on the ends I put
this everywhere it doesn't leave a
residue it just really hydrates my hair
and makes it feel nice and soft I notice
a difference when I don't use this
product my bangs are like this part of
my hair right here it's so frizzy and
dry so I'll put a little bit of this
like right here and I feel like it
really does condition my hair so well
and then after that if my hair is
feeling super dry like super super dry I
will go in with the diva curl one
condition delight this is kind of a
newer product to me I've been using it
for about a month and a half now but I
just love how well it conditions the
ends of my hair I don't focus this on my
entire
like I do with the resort go milk I will
focus this on my ends only if my hair
feels like extra frizzy and dry I'll
even mix this in with my hair mask every
once in a while this is a hundred
percent sulfate paraben and silicon free
ok so then that's pretty much all I do I
know a lot of people will use a diffuser
with their blow-dryer to enhance their
curls but if I can't avoid heat I rather
do that I mean I hate style my hair so
much with all the straightening I do so
when I want to leave it natural I really
just like let it be natural and usually
I wash my hair like a couple of hours
before bed and then I'll go to sleep and
then the next morning this is what my
hair looks like and then I will just go
in with a couple of more products once
my hair is already dry the next day I
start off with this bad boy again just
to kind of make my hair a little bit
damp just a tad bit I will spray this
all over my hair and then I will go in
with one of these products I didn't know
which one to talk about today so I kind
of mixed them both for the demo but I
usually just used one or the other this
is the Rio Gio curl charisma rice amino
and avocado leave-in defining cream this
is a finishing cream for curly to wavy
hair and reduces frizz enhances shine
moisture and softness it has avocado oil
quinoa rice amino acids no parabens no
silicones or phthalates I love this I
have been using this for a while now and
it just does a really good job of making
my curls look fresh even two to three
days after I wash it so I really love
how this makes my curls look but then
sometimes I will go in with the pure
ology color stylist illuminating curl
this is a 24 hour shaping lotion for
color-treated hair this product is a
little bit thicker it's less milky it
has more of like a jelly consistency I
like this one simply for the fact that
it kind of makes my curls look a little
bit glossy err they recommend using this
on wet hair but I find that when I spray
it with water first and it's a little
bit damp it works just as well so yeah I
will typically go in with one of these
products I will say though this one goes
bad pretty quickly yes because it has
avocado in it or something it will start
to smell pretty rancid once it's going
back like you'll know it's going bad by
the scent and then that's pretty much it
that is my natural hair routine that
completes this video I hope you guys
found it helpful in some way
