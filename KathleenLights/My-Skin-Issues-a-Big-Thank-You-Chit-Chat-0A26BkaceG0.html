bit different I really just wanted to
sit down and talk to you guys just
chatting it's not a cat chats but I'm
here chatting I wanted to talk to you
guys about a couple of things I'm just
sitting in like my little hallway in my
video room there's like this tiny little
hallway that leads to my bathroom this
is my bathroom and then this is my
closet and I just decided to sit on the
floor and press record this video is
gonna be really random I'm really just
going to be sitting here and talking I
have such a mess in this part of my room
like the other side is what you guys see
like what I do catch that's I'm on the
couch or when I'm at my vanity or when I
film tutorials I like to face my windows
so I'm sitting in front of my computer
desk but I haven't done a room tour
because I have such a mess over here
like I have I don't know because you
know all my palettes just sitting here I
have these shelves and this one is about
to like fall look at this it's supposed
to be like this but I have way too much
weight on it really dumb decision to put
loading shelves when you have such heavy
makeup done decision but whatever I have
to see what I do there I know I don't
blog anymore I have a vlog channel and I
always link it below but I kind of feel
like the more I grow in subscribers I
mean this is for everyone obviously but
the more you grow in subscribers the
more people don't like you as weird as
that sounds and I'm always kind of
scared to put my personal life on the
internet and with a makeup channel
you're just really talking about makeup
I mean you guys get to see my personal
side when I do cat chats and stuff like
that but it's almost easier when it
comes to makeup then I realize you know
like I could vlog in a way where it's
not so personal you know like why
thought out and I'm doing things with
friends or anything like that like I can
vlog so I'm starting I think I want to
start vlogging again I'll see how that
goes I wanted to update you guys on my
skin here I've mentioned it in like a
hundred videos I know it's gonna be so
annoying just in case you don't know
kind of I've changed my diet I've just
been eating a lot healthier I don't eat
dairy anymore at all I don't eat fast
food or anything like that and then my
skin just started freaking out
ever since I make those decisions you
can't tell because my vlog camera has
like a soft focusing thing but I have
I mean you can see it I have breakouts
all over my chest and all over my
forehead and they're like traveling down
to the sides of my forehead now they're
even coming down here and I don't
understand what's happening a lot of
people are telling me that my skin is
going through a detox this has been
happening since like the first few days
in August and we already like halfway
through September and I was googling
that your skin can do a detox when you
start eating healthy but it's been a
while and I was reading that a detox
period usually lasts like three weeks
and it's not getting better it's kind of
getting a little bit worse I went to an
allergist to see if maybe I was allergic
to certain foods or nuts or seeds but
I'm not thankfully I'm not allergic to
any of those things I also went to my
doctor my primary care doctor and she
told me that it looks like a just a
detox she's like honestly I can't think
anything of it looks like a detox I'm
gonna get blood taken out in the next
few days because she wants to see my
blood work and then I went to see a
dermatologist and they prescribed me
kind of like a topical cream and I tried
it out in the other day for the first
time and then I tweeted immediately I
was like oh my gosh this cream that the
dermatologist gave me made my skin 20
times worse and I was about to throw
that cream in the garbage it made my
skin so bad like it made it flare up a
lot it got really really red right here
especially and I was so frustrated but a
lot of you guys on Twitter we're
actually tweeting me telling me to keep
using it because topical creams
typically will make your skin flare up
but we'll make it look worse before it
gets better it's kind of just like
bringing everything to the surface so I
took your advice I'm going to continue
to use it the doctor told me since my
skin is so dry that she didn't want me
using it every day so I used a different
moisturizer last night I'm going to take
your word for it that it gets worse
before it gets better so I just wanted
to show you guys pictures of my skin
it's just something I'm dealing with
right now it's kind of strange because I
never ever ever had acne or anything my
entire life so now I kind of understand
like how should it is to be insecure
about your skin especially like I love
wearing tank top like this I usually
wear like little jackets over them but I
live in tank tops they're so comfortable
and so basic or like him and you know my
chest pimples are so visible and I also
think another crappy part of always
having nice skin is people are not used
to seeing my skin like this so every
time I see someone who I haven't seen in
about a month and they see me and
they're like oh my god Kathleen what
happened to your face oh my god Kathleen
what's wrong with your chest Kathleen
you're breaking out all over your
forehead and it's so frustrating cuz
it's like I have a mirror I know I know
you don't have to remind me I know but I
mean I'm trying to fix the situation if
it is a detox I don't know how long it's
gonna last or what I don't want to go
back to eating unhealthy because I feel
so much better with my stomach my
stomach was really sensitive to Dairy
and took me 24 years to realize that but
I haven't gotten a stomach ache in a
long time and I was somebody who always
got a stomach ache after eating and I
didn't I didn't understand why hopefully
it gets better and if you're having like
skin issues or acne problems especially
if you're young if you're watching this
and you're young and you have acne like
in your teens it'll go away don't worry
about it it's just something we have to
deal with now but stick through it or
push through it another reason why I
want to actually the main reason I
wanted to sit down and talk to you guys
is because today is actually world
suicide prevention day not when you're
watching this cuz I don't think I'm not
I mean I'm not going to post this today
and I don't know if that's like a made
up thing kind of like national donut day
or national booger day they I mean
everybody makes those things up but I
think it's nice that we have a day where
we bring awareness to those who are
going through depression or have had
suicidal thoughts because depression is
such a serious thing and I kind of
wanted to make this video just in case
you are watching this if you're a
subscriber of mine and you're going
through a really shitty time in your
life there's nothing really I can do
because I'm not there with you hug you
or to tell you it's gonna be okay but
hopefully you can kind of get that
feeling through this video I know
sometimes life can feel really really
hard a lot of the times when you watch
these youtubers who have all these nice
things and they go on all these trips
and they look like they're having the
time of their lives and you're at home
depressed or sad and you just don't
understand why I know it sucks but you
know sometimes things are not always
what they appear to be there was a time
in my life
I was so so depressed I didn't even
recognize myself like I couldn't believe
I have I have been so depressed and
nobody knew about it no one in my life
really knew how depressed I was you just
never really known the war in someone's
mind the struggles in someone's mind no
matter what it may appear like on the
outside always keep that in mind and if
you are sad if something is happening in
your life that's making you sad I'm so
sorry and I wish there was something I
could do to fix it but all I can do is
tell you that I believe in you you can
get through this sometimes for me all I
needed to know was that somebody cared
and I just want to tell you I'm that
person for you I care and a lot of
people can be watching this and like
rolling their eyes like sure you care
what I do I care I've been in that
position I have never had suicidal
thoughts myself but I have woken up in
the past thinking like what is the point
like why am I even living what's the
point because everything is going wrong
but there is a point we're all here for
something we're all put on this earth
for a purpose whether you have faith or
not nothing in Our Lives is for no
reason so you're going through this hard
time in your life right now for
something maybe it's to teach you
something maybe it's to teach someone
else in your life something maybe the
situation that you're in right now is to
make you a stronger individual all I can
do is tell you is try to have as much
positivity as you can and it's really
really hard for me to say because
sometimes when things are going bad I
can be so negative in my mind and I can
just shut everybody out and be my own
worst enemy and I know how that feels
and I don't want you to be the same way
so please try I know it's so hard to be
positive in such a negative situation
but the only way I feel at least from
personal experience the only way to push
through something is to believe in
yourself and to be focused on getting
better you know tell yourself I'm going
through something really bad right now
but I can push through it time will heal
my wounds and I could push through it
I'm positive I'm strong I can do this
and even if you don't believe in
yourself the more you tell yourself you
will believe it so this video is also
for me to tell you guys thank you I know
I say thank you all the time but it's
usually in some other video where I talk
about
other things but I wanted to just sit
here until you guys thank you putting
myself on the internet for so many
people to see has affected me a little
bit in the past years I'm always worried
about what people are gonna say what
people are gonna think of me because so
many people are watching me today is not
even about that today is just a huge
thank you for watching and thank you for
commenting such nice things all the time
because you guys have really really
helped me even like with my skin stuff
like I'll tweet about it and a lot of
you guys are always giving me opinions
and advice on how to fix it or what I
can do or whenever I tweet that I feel
bad which by the way I have a cold right
now and I am I have to pre record and
I'm dreading it because I feel so bad
but I got to do it you guys are always
telling me like what kind of cold
medicines work best for you guys always
trying to help me fight through my cold
you guys are always worried about me
when I feel bad and thank you so much I
like it honestly warms my heart every
time I get a tweet that's so kind it
makes me realize like wow there are good
people out there in the world they
really really are and especially now the
world has gone to absolute because
that's how I feel sometimes it's nice to
know that not everybody is crappy
there are a lot of good people there are
more good people than there are bad
people you guys have no idea when I
first started my channel I was still
kind of saddened about certain events in
my life I made a whole video on it um it
was my anxiety video and how and why I
have anxiety what caused it or whatever
it's up on my channel but in 2011 it was
like the worst year of my life my
parents had gotten divorced when I was
18 and then a couple months after they
got divorced my dad got into a really
bad motorcycle accident he almost died
he ended up getting a traumatic brain
injury I went into detail I'm sorry if
this is repetitive but if you haven't
seen it I've gotten a traumatic brain
injury and it kind of affected him
forever after that thank God he is okay
and he's almost I would say he's back to
normal he's definitely not the same man
he was before the accident but he's on
this earth and I'm so grateful for it
but since his injury was more you know
it targeted the brain it wasn't physical
like he looked perfectly fine physically
but he wasn't in his brain his brain was
bleeding it was just a traumatic brain
injury his recovery was so hard for him
for me for my uncle for everybody that
experienced that and for such a long
time I
needed life he went through so many
things and he did so many things that he
would have never done it was just his
brain was so messed up and I didn't
understand put me in such a bad mood
I really wasn't happy with myself
especially since I had so much anger
towards my parents for the divorce it
affected me more than anything in my
life and I don't know if it's because I
spent 18 years with them by my side I
never knew what it was like to grow up
with divorced parents like everybody in
my life actually had divorced parents
and I feel like we were like the perfect
loving amazing family for 18 years and
then one day to the next it was just
like gone it was ripped from me I didn't
take it very well I did not take it well
don't do this day they got divorced six
years ago and I still don't get it like
I don't I don't understand why that
happened
make me I'll never understand I don't
want to cry because I'm okay with him
hell I'm fine it's been six years I'm an
adult
I understand relationships and but I was
so blindsided because they never fought
they've never argued so it was so
strange to me but it put me in the worst
depression of my life and then since
right after you know my dad accident
happened it was so much all at once and
I didn't know how to handle it so I
really I just want to let you know I
know what it's like to feel like the
world is against you or to feel like the
world is falling on top of you because
that's how I felt for a really long time
and the crazy thing is is that YouTube
watching YouTube really really helped me
I would feel like I was suffocating
throughout the day in and out of
hospitals with my father in and out of
trying to understand his you know his
brain injury trying to wrap my head
around the whole thing my ticket out of
my mind was YouTube and I would sit
there and I would watch making videos
and even if it was only for 15 minutes
my mind was somewhere else for those 15
minutes and I was so grateful for
YouTube and then when Danny pushed me to
start a YouTube channel it took my mind
off so many things you guys made me just
feel even better and the more comments I
got and how sweet you guys are with your
motivation and your encouraging words
you guys have made me stronger I just
want to say thank you for that and I
want
I want you guys to see my channel as an
outlet also may be watching the cat
chats makes you feel better or maybe
watching a makeup tutorial makes you
feel better and if that's the case then
I feel like a million dollars you know I
feel like I did something to affect
someone in a positive way and that makes
me feel better than anything ever could
Oh everybody helps each other in the
comments and it just it makes me feel so
good and sometimes when social media can
seem like such a dark place I'm glad
it's not always like that I'm gonna wrap
up this video here because I feel like
I'll just start rambling and then I
won't make any sense here soon maybe I
haven't been making sense in this video
but thank you for being the best friends
anybody could ever ask for and I love
you guys so much even though I don't
personally know each and every one of
you
I recognize comments I recognize names
and if you're watching and you're
commenting you know I feel your support
and I love you for it
I appreciate it always I know
everybody's afraid that the more people
grow on YouTube the more they will
change but sometimes change is good I
feel like I have changed since I started
my channel I'm more positive because of
you guys I will always appreciate the
love from my subscribers I will never
take that for granted whether or not
people believe that so I love you guys
so much and I hope this video helped you
even if it just helped you a little bit
