my top 5 favorite drugstore bronzers I
don't want to do like a top 5 drugstore
series like top 5 bronzers and
foundations and highlighters and stuff
like that let me know down below if you
would be interested in something like
that also if I sound weird I'm sick and
I know a bunch of you guys are gonna
comment like oh my god Kathleen you are
always sick it's not that I'm always
sick it's just that sometimes I will
lose my voice or will get really raspy
and I'm like oh god I'm sick I'm getting
sick and then the next day I'll wake up
and I'll be perfectly fine so I'm a
little bit dramatic in the videos I'm
like oh excuse my voice I'm sick but the
next day I'm usually perfectly fine but
I've been pretty sick for like 3 days
already so my nose is really clogged up
I have like the I have a cold
and I wasn't gonna film a video today
but it's Tuesday and I've been really
good about posting videos at least 3
times a week so a video has to go up
tomorrow so I'm sucking it up and I'm
sitting here and I'm gonna film okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and get started and I
am NOT going in any particular order I
will say though that the majority of
these bronzers are met
I just prefer matte bronzer for like an
everyday thing I really love shimmery
bronzers as well for like a very
luminous glow but for day-to-day I
prefer bronzers that are matte or at
least that have no glitter one of these
bronzers is shimmery though but I still
absolutely love it anyway let's get
started so the first bronzer I'm gonna
be talking about is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster this is in the
shade medium to dark this is what it
looks like it comes in this beautiful
packaging I love this packaging like
more than anything and this is what it
looks like on the inside like I said the
packaging is great because it comes with
a nice mirror right here and then it
flips and you had a brush that came
right here but I didn't use it I threw
it away it was like really hard but I
really really love this bronzer because
it does come off really natural but you
can build it up it is very very
buildable and even though it is matte it
doesn't have any sparkles or anything
like
it does have like a satin finish I feel
because it does kind of reflect light in
a pretty way I don't know how to
describe it you see when you swatch it
it kind of has a machine to it that
looks so so pretty in the spring and
summer and even in the winter I just
really really love this bronzer one of
my favorite bronzers ever high-end
drugstore and even though Physicians
Formula is like a pretty pricy drugstore
brands they're always on sale at CBS I
got mine for like 50% off when I went to
go buy it so it's definitely worth the
money but look up for coupons and the
packaging is just gorgeous it reminds me
of like those tanning bottles like the
Australian Gold is that was that the one
I don't know ever made me look like a
tanning lotion another favorite of mine
I have used in a ton of my videos and it
is the NYC Sun and bronze bronzing
powder in Montauk bronze this one comes
in a bunch of different shades but this
one is my favorite one it has like three
darker strips and then two light ones in
the middle and you just swirl them all
together and it gives you such a pretty
pretty color what I love about this one
is that it isn't orange I mean it is a
little bit warm but it's more on the red
side like a brown on the red side of
warm if that makes any sense it looks so
pretty on the skin especially in the
summertime because it does have a little
bit of a red to it which is what your
tans usually have like your natural tan
so this looks really pretty in this
summer and I know a lot of people love
the NYC sunny bronzer I mean it's good
but I definitely prefer the Montauk
bronze over this one and they're pretty
much the exact same price I think this
is like $2.99 if I'm not mistaken and
yeah I just really really love it my
friend Malin actually got like a
defective one it has like a film over it
and she wasn't getting any pigment off
of it which is so weird so I hope that
was just hers and it doesn't happen to
anybody else because it is a really
great bronzer I really really love Sonia
Kashuk of products and I think that her
cream bronzers are phenomenal they have
high-end quality in my opinion they're
super luxurious and the package
is so beautiful I just think the
packaging is super like classy nice and
gold I love it I have both of the shades
that she carries this one is warm tan
and this one is rich bronze one it's
just a little bit darker than the other
one this one in warm tan is a little bit
on the orange side I'm not gonna lie
there is a lot of warmth to it but it
doesn't really bother me because in the
spring and summer I mean I know I keep
talking about the spring and summer but
that's what we've got going on right now
it looks nice and it just matches with
nice glowy skin I love my warm shades
you know that but this is supposedly a
dupe for the Chanel 10/10 they Chanel
something like that you know what I'm
talking about you know I got this one is
supposedly different and I've seen
pictures and they are pretty freaking
similar so if you don't want to check
out fifty dollars for that Chanel
bronzer then definitely check out these
Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer in warm tan
and if you're a little bit darker in
skin tone than me I would definitely go
with rich bronze is a darker version of
that and there's a little bit less
orange to it this one is definitely more
brown in color than orange so if you
don't like orange bronzers definitely
check out rich bronze I really love the
formula of these bronzers they are
creams but they definitely give you like
a powder finish once you swirl it in
your hands and they do set nicely on the
face it doesn't stay sticky or creamy on
your face it really does set down to
like a powdery finish I know how to
explain it the formula is insane I love
them and it even comes with this little
thing in here but the next bronzer I
want to talk about actually comes in a
duel with a blush and it is the elf
contouring blush and bronzing powder
this is in the shade Saint Lucia it was
the original one that they came out with
I know they have like three or four
other ones that I also own but this one
is my favorite I'm not super super crazy
about the blush I mean I'll use it I
like it
but the bronzer is where it's at I love
this bronzer
especially when I'm super super tan
because it is a very very pigmented
bronzer as you can see there it's a
little scary
this is literally my favorite bronzer
when I'm dark and tan this one at my
Bahama Mama bronzer by the balm they're
the best they're really dark but don't
get scared you can't use this very very
lightly if you use a light hand and it
still gives you a beautiful color to
your face and even though there is
little specks of glitter in it this is
the bronzer I was talking about that has
some shimmer in it when you apply it to
your face it's kind of like the glitter
it's just fall right off because I
cannot tell that they're on my face at
all I don't look like a little fairy
when I have this on my face or anything
it's not sparkly it does come off pretty
matte in my opinion so definitely check
this out if you have a darker skin tone
I think you would really like it or even
if you don't have darker skin tone just
try it it's cool and they last longer
I'm going to be talking about today it's
actually the bronzer that I have on my
face right now and it is the Rimmel
natural bronzer in the shade Sun bronze
this bronzer is really really
inexpensive and it is matte it has the
same packaging as the NYC one that I
showed earlier so I mean the packaging
is kind of like cheapy but for two
dollars you can't beat that and I
actually really really love this bronzer
a lot because of the color even though
it is a little bit warm it has like an
orange you tend to it a little bit I
find that it is a little bit pink at the
same time I don't know if it's just me
but honestly reminds me of a giant Mac
soft brown eyeshadow you know the
eyeshadow soft Brown by Mac I feel like
this is a giant version of it super
weird I know but I love the color on
this and it does have a creamy finish to
it like it it's a powder but it feels
nice and smooth I feel like the formula
of this is really really good it's nice
and pigmented super affordable and out
of all the colors that they have Sun
bronze is definitely my favorite one so
yeah this is perfect for you if you're
on a budget or just looking for a good
bronzer because it is really good okay
