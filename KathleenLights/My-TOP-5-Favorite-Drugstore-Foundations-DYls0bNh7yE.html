my top 5 favorite drugstore foundations
I did a top 5 favorite drugstore
bronzers and I asked you guys in that
video if you wanted me to do like a
series you know like top 5 favorite
drugstore foundations and highlighters
and a bunch of other stuff and a lot of
you guys were like yes please make it a
series so that is what I'm doing today
it is the second video in the series and
it is about foundations now keep in mind
that everybody is different and
everybody has different skin types and
preferences and stuff like that so these
are my favorite foundations at the
drugstore and I haven't tried every
foundation at the drugstore I'm sure
there's a bunch more that I might like
more than these but out of all the ones
that I tried these are my favorite ok so
I'm going to go ahead and get started
none of these are in any order of which
I like more or anything like that but I
will say that the two that I'm going to
show you first are like my holy grail
writer dye favorite absolute favorite
foundations the other ones are still my
favorite but they're not as good as the
first two I'm going to show you so the
first foundation I want to share with
you is the Bourjois healthy mix serum
this is not the Bourjois healthy mix
foundation this is the serum it's still
foundation but it's amazing I'm obsessed
with this this is a gel formula and I
find that it works really well with my
skin by the way I'm sure you guys
already know I mention it all the time
but for the sake of this video I just
wanna mention I have dry sensitive skin
these summer I'm more normal to dry I
can get away with wearing like matte
foundations in the summer if I
moisturize really well but in the winter
it's mmm I'm glad very dry and like I
said my skin is very sensitive
I don't really break out into acne but
my skin gets really really irritated I
get a bunch of bumps everywhere and I
just have really sensitive skin so this
is a great foundation I got mine off of
Amazon or Ebay I don't really remember
it was about 13 dollars which is why I'm
including it in this video because that
is a drugstore price I'm not exactly
sure how much Bourjois goes for like in
europe and canada and all those places
because they don't sell bourgeois in the
States
unfortunately because I'm obsessed with
this it's so hard to find this I can't
find this color anywhere and I've looked
for it forever I'm in a shade 52 vanilla
even though this is too light for me
right now because I am darker going into
spring and summer so I can't wear this
right now which sucks but I'm hoping I
can find this color again online or a
darker color I don't know anyway it's
great for sensitive skin because it's
hypoallergenic it has like really good
ingredients in it it is vitamin enriched
and it just gives you such a really
pretty flawless dewy look this is a
light coverage foundation you can build
it up to get a medium coverage and it
won't look cakey you can put layers and
layers and layers of this stuff on your
face and it will not look cakey I have a
full review and demo of this foundation
I will link it down below and I'll give
you more information on that I did a
whole video so I want to go too much
into this but this is heavenly I love it
so my next favorite foundation I love
just as much maybe even a little bit
more just because it's been my holy
grail foundation from the drugstore for
so so long and it is the Revlon
Colorstay foundation I get the one for
normal to dry skin just because the
regular color state is like god-awful
on my face it like clings to every dry
patch ever so I really really love the
enormous dry skin formula it doesn't
take up on my face it just sits very
very well on my skin I have the color
250 fresh beige this is like my perfect
summer color like in the middle of
summer this is the foundation I use I
haven't bought one that matches me right
now or in the winter don't know why but
this foundation is the best it has never
broken me out or given me like a weird
allergic reaction which is great and it
is a full coverage this is the
foundation I like to wear whenever I
feel like my skin is not at its best
because it is full full coverage it
covers everything and it just looks so
good all you need is one layer because
of the coverage and you're good to go
and it doesn't feel like I'm wearing a
mask even though it's full coverage it's
not heavy on my skin is the kind of
foundation I have to use with my Beauty
Blender just
because I feel like with or with any
sponge I feel like it applies best with
a sponge I kind of don't like how it
applies with a brush I really love how
it looks with my Beauty Blender it's
like the perfect pairing and just
because it is the normal to dry skin
formula this isn't a dewy finish at
least I don't think so it gives me like
a nice satin finish to the skin but it
isn't drying so even if you have oily
skin I still recommend this one because
I feel like it's just really good I
don't know the United Nations I want to
talk about I love it because it's like a
day to day foundation for me I don't
wear foundation every day but it is the
Rimmel stay matte foundation I didn't
think I was going to like this because
it says stay matte and I have dry skin
but it works really well with my skin I
just have to use a primer with it
because I'm not a kind of like clings to
certain areas I use my Maybelline Baby
skin every time I use this just because
the baby skin kind of gives you like a
slick surface to apply this on top but
anyway I really love it it is a moosie
texture which I really really like
enough foundation it's like the whipped
butter II type of texture that makes any
sense and I just feel like it glides on
my face really nicely gives me a nice
even canvas this is a medium coverage
foundation you could push it to full I
have and it doesn't look cakey
none of these foundations look cakey on
me I have the color true ivory which was
a pretty good match for me a couple
months ago
but again too light for me now and like
I said I like this more for like a day
to day when I don't want to try too hard
with foundation because it is very very
lightweight it really doesn't feel like
you have much on the skin and it doesn't
leave a tacky finish to skin you don't
even like some foundations you put them
on and they kind of don't set they don't
dry I don't get that with this although
I will say that if you have oily skin I
don't think this will keep you mat
because even me who I have dry skin I
don't feel like it's a matte finish at
all I think it's a nice satin finish but
it's more natural I don't know I don't
think it's like a super
Matt finish I also have a review and
demo on this so I will link this one
down below as well okay so my next
favorite is the Revlon Colorstay whipped
foundation this stuff is so good I love
the regular color stay more but this one
comes close I mean it's really really
nice it has that whipped moosie texture
that I told you guys I really really
love I thought this was going to be a
drying formula just because I know so
many people with oily skin really liked
it but I decided to give it a try anyway
because I love the original color say so
much and this stuff is great I do
moisturize right before I put this on
because if not I feel like it does cling
on to maybe some of my dry patches but
even then when I apply this with my
Beauty Blender it kind of thins it out a
little bit and it gives such a nice
satin finish to the skin this is also
full coverage and the best part about
this foundation it says it's a 24-hour
foundation but I mean I've never worn it
for 24 hours but it lasts forever this
is the foundation I put on whenever I
know I'm going to be out or like
sweating or I'm going to be somewhere
for a really really really long time and
I know that I need my foundation to last
all day this is the foundation I go for
and I also find that it photographs well
at least for me it does I just love
everything about it it's long lasting
good coverage a nice satin finish it's
just it's just magic in a bottle the
only downside I will say is the
packaging besides the fact that it's a
giant tub it's glass and it's heavy and
I'm clumsy
but besides that um the screw kind of
broke on mine so it won't screw all the
way which sucks but what can you do okay
so the last foundation I'm going to be
talking about or foundations I should
say are the L'Oreal True Match --is this
is the True Match Lumi and this is the
original True Match I am combining this
as one favorite foundation just because
I feel like they are so similar the only
difference is the packaging and the
finish the L'Oreal True Match Lumi gives
you a nice
- Dewey finish it's a little bit more
moisturizing and the original true match
just gives you a nice set in very
natural finish it's not matte but it is
a very natural finish
I love these both just the same
depending on what look I'm going for
either go for the Lummi or the regular
actually I'm wearing the lumi on my face
right now this is the foundation that is
ideal for dry skin if you have dry skin
definitely go with this one it just
gives you a nice moisturising dewy look
but if you have more normal to oily skin
I would definitely go with the original
True Match they're both really good I
feel like this one doesn't cling on to
dry patches it's not drying at all it
just gives me a nice natural finish that
I feel still works with my dry skin so
these are just so so good I just had to
include both of them the only thing that
I feel like this one is better in is the
packaging this one has a pump which this
one does not this one needs to come out
with a pump already like what are they
waiting for this packaging is so much
better but anyway yeah thank you guys so
much for watching those were my top 5
favorite drugstore foundations like I
said none of these have ever broken me
out and they just seemed to work with my
skin type I haven't tried all the
foundations at the drugstore but these
are the ones that I've liked so far do

below letting me know your absolute
