numeral two this in my this is
technically six so video number three in
my drugstore series and it is my top
five favorite drugstore highlighters I
am especially excited to film this video
because I love highlighters there are my
favorite things to put on my face I just
love really really glowy skin like I've
said it a million times
my goal is to look like Jenny from the
block so she's always glowy and I just
want to be here and I don't know about
you guys but I feel like the only thing
the drugstore lacks is highlighters they
have really really good foundations even
eyeshadows and so many things that the
drugstore has that are comparable to
high-end but I feel like their
highlighters are just kind of lacking
they need to step up their game with
really good highlighters I have come
across the most chunky glitter iasts hot
messes of highlighters at the drugstore
but the ones I'm going to be sharing
with you today are not like that they
are the best ones I've found at the
drugstore by far so I'm going to be
sharing with you my favorite ones I have
actually an honorable mention so it's
like a top six so I'm not going to go in
any specific order but the first two
that I am going to be sharing with you
are my absolute favorite ones and if you
don't have these highlighters already
run girl run so I'm going to start off
with my favorite drugstore highlighter
of all the time nothing compares
absolutely nothing it's literally the
best highlighter ever and it is the
Physicians Formula shimmer strip in
Miami strip this is literally the most
beautiful highlight I have ever seen in
the history of my life in terms of the
drugstore but it is gorgeous
I mainly use these three strips right at
the bottom because these two at the top
are a little bit too dark for me and I
honestly cannot tell you how gorgeous
this highlight is it has a strip of pink
and then two light gold ones so when you
mix it all together it gives you like a
nice champagne
glowy golden II yet baiji highlight I
don't know it's so gorgeous and of
course the best part about this is that
you don't need to use just one strip you
could use the one at the bottom for a
more pink highlight this one for like a
more gold and I specifically love this
product because I think it works for all
skin tones if you're really really fair
you could use the one at the bottom and
if you are darker you can use the ones
at the top these work more as like a
bronzer for me but it works for all
different skin tones and honestly I have
come across very few highlighters at the
drugstore that are this pigmented it's
not sheer at all it's just beautiful and
so so glowy it gives such a beautiful
Sheen to your face I posted a picture of
this on my Instagram the other day and a
bunch of you guys said that my skin
looked nice and glowy and it was so
pretty and it was all thanks to this bad
boy I've also used these darker colors
at the top for a really nice bronzy eye
makeup and it works so good so good and
my other highlight in my top two even
though I loved that one
just a little bit more it is my hard
candy so baked bronzer intiki
they say this is a bronzer but obviously
it's not this is just your basic
straight up gold highlight but not in an
intense frosty way it's not like a
metallic gold it's a very soft warm
champagne kind of gold and it looks so
pretty on the skin what I love about
this bronzer is because it's baked it is
so finely milled that there are no
chunks no glitters no streakiness with
this product it's just really really
fine really fine powder this looks so
beautiful when you have a nice glowy tan
I just throw it on the top of my
cheekbones and it just makes me look all
goddess like and glowy it's beautiful if
you are very very very fair I don't know
if you will like it I mean it could work
but I don't I don't know but I still
think it would work for a lot of
different skin tones it is just so
beautiful and because it is a baked
product you can use it wet so if you
want that super metallic in your face
highlight just add a little bit of fix+
and
you will look like next one I want to
talk about is technically three of them
but I'm including it as one because it
is the same product and it is the elf
baked highlighters have pink diamonds
blush gems and moonlight pearl I think
these are the only ones elf carries they
have three of them and they're all
really really great my favorite one
personally is moonlight pearl this is
what it looks like it is a really nice
beige champagne color these are the
colors I tend to go for in my highlights
you're really pretty light champagne
colors that just look super glowy and
wet on the skin I don't know these
colors are the ones that I like to wear
the most like I said it's a beautiful
champagne color it looks so nice on the
skin and I really like the formula of
these because they aren't chunky at all
they do have a little bit of glitter in
them but it's not something I find
irritating on my skin it doesn't look
like weird little glitters are all over
my face so I'm really impressed with
these and they're only three dollars
super affordable I got mine on the elf
website but yeah moonlight pearl is
definitely my favorite one even though a
lot of people love blush gems if you are
into the more bronzy kind of highlight
definitely pick up blush gems it's like
the rosy kind of bronze color it has a
little bit of pink a little bit of
champagne a little bit of bronze got a
little bit of everything so this color
is also really really beautiful but I do
find that moonlight pearl is a little
bit more pigmented this one is just a
little bit more sheer but they're both
really good and if you're into really
really pink highlights and definitely go
with pink diamonds pick highlights are
the ones that I kind of stay away from
but this one is so pretty because it has
an iridescent to it just has this
beautiful glowy like iridescent on your
cheeks it looks like it could be two
different colors when you wear it this
pink diamond ones is actually really
really gorgeous so if you are into the
pink highlights I think you would really
really love this one because it's really
unique a next favorite I use it more as
a really really nice highlighting blush
but it is
definitely highlight for a lot of
different people and it is the
Maybelline master highlight highlighting
blush in the shade nude this is what it
looks like like I said this could be a
highlight for anybody darker than me but
for very fair skin this is definitely
going to be a blush for you but even
then it's a nice beautiful glowy blush
it is more on the pinky side but it does
have really pretty bronze strips going
through this pattern and it just gives
it a really nice bronzy pink color to
your cheeks so so beautiful this looks
amazing on top of matte blushes it looks
amazing on its own personally for me but
I think that if you are medium to dark
skin tones this would be such a
beautiful pinky bronze highlight again
the formula is amazing not streaky not
chunky not glittery just absolute
perfection and number five on my list
before my honorable mention is one that
will sue people who want a very very
subtle highlight and it is the
Physicians Formula mineral glow pearls
highlight in beige pearl and this is
what it looks like it is one of those
champagne beige colors that I told you I
absolutely love but it is a very toned
down muted kind of highlight it gives a
very subtle Sheen to your cheeks this is
the highlight I'm wearing right now only
I packed it on like a mother because I
wanted it to be a little bit more
pigmented so this is perfect for you if
you want something very subtle not
something that'll be like whoa girl
you've got a highlight on that this is
definitely the one for you because it
does give you a nice and glowy sheen but
it is very very natural which is why I
included it in this video this is for
those of you who just don't want too
much just one enough and then last but
not least my little honourable mention
it is a liquid illuminator from the
drugstore technically it is a primer I
use it as a primer but for those of you
who don't like to look super glowy all
over your face you could definitely use
this in specific areas on your face as a
highlight and it is the L'Oreal magic
lumi light infusing primer I love this I
used to use it as just a straight-up
liquid highlight I started using it all
over my face since I have really dry
skin and I just like all of it to look
glowy all of it but
this stuff is so so pretty it's like a
white pearly finish this is definitely
something that's gonna make you look
really really glowy I love liquid
highlights but the drugstore does not
have any like I haven't found any liquid
highlights at the drugstore do me a
favor if you guys know of any liquid or
cream highlights from the drugstore
please let me know down below because I
have been on the hunt for one when you
pump this out on your hand it is
straight up white and you're like well
what's what's going on here this is
white but when you blend this into your
skin it gives you like such a beautiful
glow to your face like if you're
naturally glowing from within like that
really pretty wet look oh my god this
stuff is amazing hey check this out if
you are looking for a liquid illuminator
from the drugstore because it is so good
so so good okay so those were my top
five favorite drugstore highlighters of
all time I absolutely love them they're
great quality as for the lasting power I
find that they last a pretty good time
on my skin personally all highlander's
lasts a long time on me I don't know
what it is but they just stay looking
glowy for a long time I don't know
actually for me depends on my foundation
if I have a really really good
foundation on my highlight will last all
day if I don't you will fade throughout
the day so honestly it's about the base
for me thank you guys so much for
