my top 5 actually it's 6 because I
couldn't pick his 5 favorite perfumes of
all time I did an entire perfume
collection on my channel like a year ago
but that video was so long because I
gave you the notes and I went through
each perfume I owned it was really
really long I have like 20 perfumes I
know that seems crazy like I said in
that video there are two types of people
in this world there are the people that
wear the same signature scent all the
time and then there are people like me
who collects perfume and has no shame in
that
I wear a different perfume all the time
sometimes I'll go like weeks with the
same perfume
sometimes I'll wear a different one
every single day I have certain perfumes
that I wear like on certain days of the
year I'm like a psychopath I'm addicted
to perfumes I just feel like perfumes
really tell a story and I have a
different perfume for a different mood
I'm in personally I'm addicted to them
and I collect them I know that's messed
up to say because perfumes do go bad
just like makeup does just like
everything does actually we all go back
but I do use all my perfumes all the
time and I wear perfume every single day
even if I'm just home that day I'm gonna
perfume on I love to smoke if you
already saw my perfume collection from
like a year more than a year ago it's
been more than a year then this might
seem repetitive because I did include
these in that video because these have
been Holy Grail for a while now and I
hope this video isn't too long I'm not
gonna go with any order except the first
one I'm gonna talk about the first
review I want to talk about is my
all-time favorite this is Gucci I can't
speak this like beautiful language I'll
do PO foo Gucci - you guys know that
some perfumes are like elda toilet or a
bit perfume I sound so dumb but this is
a perfume it's not a toilet this is my
favorite favorite favorite perfume of
all time to give you guys kind of like a
back story my sister actually gave this
perfume to me she gave me like a mini
version when I was in high school
because she didn't like it on her and
she gave it to me and I fell in love
ever since that day I don't hear anyone
talking about this perfume ever
ever I think the only other person I
hear talking about this is makeup by
Tiffany D which I get excited every time
she mentions this because I it's the
best
I feel like this perfume has a little
bit of everything it's mostly fruity
which I prefer a sweet scent this is
more like fruity for some reason any
perfume that has black currant in the
note I'm obsessed with like for example
the black currant body wash from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works is one of my favorite body
washes of all time this doesn't smell
anything like that body wash but I'm
just letting you know I'm a fan of black
currant I would consider this the kind
of fragrance that you can wear from day
to night like it's such a beautiful
daytime scent but it's also really
suitable for nighttime like I said
earlier I have a ton of perfumes and
what really like makes me repurchase a
perfume is if it lasts all day on me
like I don't want to retouch my perfume
I want to put it on during the day and
still smell good at nighttime like that
is what I want and the six that I'm
going to share with you guys today they
all do that for me they're the most
long-lasting perfumes I have out of all
of my perfumes this one is so crazy I
think this one lasts the most on me out
of all six I will spray this during the
day for example I wore this to
generation beauty and I wore this during
the day like I put it on before I left
like around 11:00 and I smelled it while
I was taking a shower like I've been
night like I was in the shower and I
still smelled good I took a shower and I
woke up the next day and my body still
smelled like this the next day after a
shower it's unreal
this is a really hard perfume to find I
thought it was being discontinued for
like years I think that it still is
going to be discontinued which breaks my
heart I can't find this size anywhere I
could only find the 1.7 fluid ounce on
Sephora this is the 3.4 I can't find the
big jug anywhere I can only find the
little one on Sephora but that's okay
I'll just continue to purchase the
little one
like I said this is Gucci - and it is my
all-time favorite perfume my next review
holds sentimental value for sure this is
the second bottle I own and this is
another Gucci perfume this is Gucci by
Gucci it's literally called Gucci by
Gucci not to be confused with Gucci
premier because this one is another
really hard perfume to find I had to
purchase mine on the Gucci website
because I
not find it anywhere which is starting
to worry me because I'm very emotionally
attached to this the new Gucci premier
is in this exact same bottle only it's
all gold but it's a completely different
scent this is another parfum this smells
very honey like but it is very fruity
it's another fruity scent but I think
that it has a stronger masculine scent
than Gucci too like there's a
masculinity or whatever you want to call
it - this perfume that just like makes
it so delicious I think this is perfect
for a businesswoman somebody who's a
kick-ass biatch
I can literally like I know when a
perfume has patchouli in it like I can
tell and I swear it's like the perfect
touch to perfumes I love perfumes to
have patchouli in them it just makes
them a little bit like stronger and just
a little bit I don't know like delicious
II I really love it if you guys didn't
know already this perfume was actually
given to me by Danny he had asked me
when we started dating what my favorite
perfume of all time was and I told him
Gucci - and he surprised me with this
thinking it was goatee - when I open the
box I was like oh we had just started
dating so I didn't want to say anything
I was like oh but then I sprayed it on
myself and I felt in love this next one
is a very very very popular one and it
is Flowerbomb by Viktor and Rolf I feel
like it's so popular for such a good
reason I know everybody likes it and
bah-bah-bah but it smells amazing my
most expensive perfume like why is this
perfume suspense
it is a normal egg but I honestly think
it's worth the money because this stays
on your skin for such a long time I'm
gonna repeat that all of these do and
surprisingly this is a very floral
perfume and if I'm gonna be honest the
floor perfumes are my least favorite to
meet it smells very powdery but in a
good way I don't really like powdery
sense like like a fruity floral powdery
scent with a hint of sexiness I don't
know it smells freaking fabulous
my next favorite has totally gone bad
and well it is pink sugar by aqua Lena
it looks like it's urine but it's not I
accidentally put this in storage when I
was
Holmes and I kept it in storage for like
three months and keeping it in storage
totally effed up this perfume you're not
supposed to keep your perfumes and
really hot temperatures you're supposed
to store all your perfumes in a cool dry
place that will prolong the life of the
perfumes if they are in a nice cool
environment so it turned the liquid like
urine yellow and it smells a little off
a little off so I totally have to throw
this one away it's actually the color
your pink sugar is supposed to look like
Oh can you'll say a boyfriend oh this is
my purse spray I'm obsessed with pink
sugar this is actually my most
inexpensive perfume this if you think
about it is not very pricey I believe
that this is the largest size they have
this is a 3.4 and this is $60 which I
mean that's not cheap by any means but
compared to like perfumes that are like
$100 it's actually a Nelda toilet but I
find that this lasts on my skin for
years it's so crazy usually L de Parfums
last longer than the toilets do cuz
they're a little bit stronger but this
one is strong out of all the perfumes I
own I get the most compliments when I
wear this one like every time I wear
this one someone's like what what what
what is that
and it's always from guys like guys love
this perfume dude everybody's body is
different and like our scents mix
differently with perfumes my mom always
tells me that sweet perfumes just mix
really well with my body chemistry every
time I wear a super sweet perfume I
always get asked what it is especially
this one like hands-down my most asked
what do you wear I don't know how true
these uh notes are I mean I definitely
smelled some of those notes but I'm just
getting these online to me what I smell
the most is cotton candy and a little
bit of caramel and vanilla mixed in
there I keep smelling this freaking
urine perfume let me grab this one okay
and then number five on my list is
Giorgio Armani see I feel like this one
is also pretty popular I did not like
this the first time I smelled it what
smelling it now I can't believe I didn't
like but I actually have a little funny
it's
funny but a little story to go along
with this I sprayed this on my body for
the first time in Sephora when I was
with Danny and then I went about my
business and the entire day Danny was
like oh my god
he smells so good he smells so good he
smells so good like he didn't shut up he
kept telling me how good I smelled and
he rarely ever does it does that you
really reduced that he only does that
with pink sugar he loves making sugar
but um this is an LD parfum by the way
he kept going on and on and I was like
well now I have to go buy it so I went
and I purchased it and I don't regret it
it's delicious
this to me screams sexy if I can think
of any perfume that I have that is sexy
it's this one I love wearing this like
on New Year's Eve just special events I
love wearing this because I don't know
it's just I feel like it's so
captivating I want to say I smell in the
vanilla and the patchouli and the woods
enos and the roof I don't know what I'm
saying Lesley if I'm going to be coming
out with you to me this smells like wine
like red or white wine mixed together
like wine it just smells like wah like a
vineyard and then my honorable mention
goes to my favoritest bottle of all-time
and it is my Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel
I think this bottle is so freakin
elegant it's so thin though like I can
tell like if I could squeeze this like I
bet you I'll break it if I squeeze it
hard not gonna do that because it
doesn't spends it but you know this is
an elder parfum and this one is I feel
like it's an acquired taste
not to me I think it's freaking fabulous
but I feel like it's an acquired taste
it's very very very very strong but this
one just like my Gucci too will last
through a hurricane what is it about
Chanel perfumes that lasts like decades
on the skin I don't know me this almost
has like a floral scent but online it's
described as a citrus this perfume is
definitely for the elegant woman I think
that it's something that a more mature
woman would wear I wouldn't necessarily
picture like a 16 year old wearing this
perfume don't get me wrong you wear what
you feel is right but I'm just
explaining like what I like what I think
of when I smell it so that completes
this video those were my top six
favorite perfumes of all time they last
so long on my
skin and if you happen to be watching
this and you like a lot of those
perfumes maybe we're similar and we like
similar sense so leave me a comment down

I'll check it out because chances are
