this through I'm sitting directly in
front of this sign no right now all
right now sir I have to sit like over
here what a bit weird if I did this
entire video like this hi I'm Kathleen
and welcome to ten youtubers you should
be watching hey guys so today's video is
going to be a little bit different it's
not gonna be a typical beauty video but
it is gonna be Beauty related and I know
I'm sitting in my cat chats corner right
now but it is not a cat chats video I'm
sorry I do want to make more cats videos
for you guys I know you guys request
them a lot and I'm trying to write down
more topics and do more things I'm
trying to get Jesse to do more cat chat
videos with me but you know jesse is so
don't worry cat chats videos they'll be
coming but I thought today I would do
something different this is a video I've
been wanting to do for a long time now
and I basically just want to go over a
few Beauty vloggers that I think are
really really underrated or I think
don't get talked about enough just
people I think need more recognition I'm
not really basing this list off of
subscribers because I think there's like
two of them that almost have like a
million subscribers I'm basing this on
like who I hear everyone talking about a
lot of the time we get caught up in the
same five Beauty vloggers and I'm not
saying that's a bad thing I'm not saying
they're bad Beauty vloggers but we
always see like the same people in the
beauty community and I kind of wanted to
shed some light on other Beauty
influencers as well just cuz you know
this town is big enough for all of us I
want to see more faces all over social
media and I just want to see more and
different people being talked about here
on YouTube at least in the beauty
community so I wrote down a list of
people who I honestly watch all the time
some of these I watched more than the
others but these are youtubers I always
go to I always watch their videos and I
just don't think they get talked about
enough that's that's basically what I'm
trying to get at with this long-ass
intro honestly I really just wanted to
do this video because this week has been
really crazy for me I'm gonna leave a
little timestamp here letting you know
when the video starts but I'm actually
gonna do that this time because I know I
forgot to do that in my last video but
I've been vocal about my stomach issues
in the past
I just suffered from really bad
stomachaches all the time I've got a
doctor I've done a few tests but now I
actually think I'm
go do an endoscopy because they can't
seem to find my answer and this past
week I've had bad stomach issues lots of
visits so toilet
things they don't want to get into for
obvious reasons which is the reason why
this week has been all over the place I
posted Monday's video like at midnight
so technically I posted it on Tuesday
and I've been getting a lot of comments
from you guys saying you're really
disappointed and I've just been posting
so late I'm so sorry I'm still posting
three times a week I'm just not posting
early in the morning recently because I
just haven't been feeling well so I'm
very very sorry I'm trying to get back
on schedule I know this video is in a
beauty video and it's kind of a chill
laid-back type of video so I hope you
guys don't mind but anyway let's go down
my list talk about a few people I really
love watching on YouTube that I think
need to be talked about more and I'll
tell you why I like watching it so the
first person I want to talk about I
actually want to talk about her because
she is one of the first people I
subscribed to on YouTube like I'm
talking about back in the day this is
like OG YouTube a lot of people don't
know this but I've been watching YouTube
since like 2008 like religiously I used
to watch it all the time in high school
and back in the day I used to watch
makeup geek makeup by Tiffany D Julie G
and there were a few more that I can't
think of right now but one of them for
sure was that girl Shay EXO I used to be
really obsessed with the show True Blood
back in the day it was one of my
favorite shows I was obsessed with Eric
Northman I think we all kind of were and
I remember finding her through like a
Trueblood makeup tutorial there was a
company that came out with True Blood
makeup I believe and she did like a
whole True Blood series this is so hold
I've been watching it for so long I just
always really really liked her makeup
tutorials I feel like I learned a lot of
my techniques through her or not like my
techniques but I learned how to do
eyeshadow because of that crochet and I
really think that she needs more
subscribers I feel like she works really
hard on her videos and she does awesome
color pop live swatches this girl is
crazy like she's literally out of her
mind whenever a color pop collection
comes out she swatches all of the
eyeshadows on her eyelids like all of
them and then she does life swatches on
her lips she puts her skin through the
ringer for her subscribers which i think
is so sweet and awesome so if you're a
color pop fan like I know a lot of
subscribers are you should subscribe to
that crochet and if you're into
tutorials you'll like all her videos as
well so I'm gonna link everybody down
below all the people I talked about
today I'm gonna link them down below but
definitely check out shade
she's an OG for me and I've been
watching her for so long I love her so I
know the title says ten but I'm actually
talking about twelve today because I
have two honorable mentions you know so
the next person I want to talk about I
feel like I talk about all the time
every time I talk about underrated
youtubers I feel like I always mention
her but I just learned so much from her
and I'm talking about Mariah Leonard if
you don't follow her are you totally
 she teaches me things in every
single video
I love how thorough she is she just
explains everything so well why she does
it why it works for her I feel like
she's always giving me well not me her
subscribers I mean I am her subscriber
so me I feel like she's giving me
different yet awesome content all the
time she always comes up with unique
ideas and topics and stuff like that for
her videos I always look forward to her
videos and her uploads just because I
know I'm gonna discover something new or
discover a new technique or a new trick
I really trust her opinion and I just I
really like her it could be the fact
that we're both aquarius's and we both
have Scorpio moons could be that it
could be it could be your beauty
knowledge as well okay so the next
person I want to talk about has a lot a
lot a lot of subscribers almost a
million subscribers that is crazy and I
know that's gonna piss off a lot of
people because I could be talking about
much smaller channels but like I said
earlier I feel like these people aren't
talked about enough anyway so I really
want to give a huge shout out to Sondra
deluxe
because I don't hear anyone talking
about her ever I don't know why she is
so freaking talented actually discovered
her through Amelia my best friend she
used to watch her all the time and she
really really got me into her and ever
since I discovered her I I like looking
at her she's one of those people that
like I just like watching her put on
makeup and I love watching her do her
makeup she's so gorgeous I know that may
seem a little vain that's not the only
reason I watch her but I just think
she's so naturally gorgeous she doesn't
go over the top or do too much and yet
she looks fabulous and I love this she
puts on like her base products with her
fingers is that weird
maybe okay so I want to give a huge
shout out to my friend Laura
mrs. Lowell in here on YouTube I know
I've spoken about her in the past but I
do not miss a video from my friend Laura
and she just reminds me so much of
old-school YouTube when there were no
drama channels when there was no like
heavy competition when there wasn't a
new release every five seconds you know
oh gee YouTube where it was just a bunch
of girls sitting in their rooms doing
empties videos favorites videos you know
videos that I do actually a lot of
people tell me all the time that I don't
conform to YouTube or that I don't keep
up with the new trendy YouTube I'm stuck
in my old beauty vlogger ways but that's
what I like I love that she still does
old school videos every Friday she does
favorites videos and I love favorites
videos and I just like her humble
personality and how welcoming put them
what the lady - me you me this friend
she's also Tori's tell my thing I'm not
gonna turn this into the zodiac thing
I'm sorry I always do somehow anyway I
always talk about Jaime all the time as
well but I couldn't do this type of
video and not mention Jaime Jaime Paige
Beauty I love her aesthetic if you go on
her Instagram I'm obsessed with her
Instagram she has like one of my I think
my favorite Instagram
I like how cool and trendy yet very
simple but glam she is I love her videos
I think they're also really informative
and she gives you good information and I
just trust her opinion so much like
whenever she tells me a product is good
usually that product is good and I also
love the way she edits her videos like
her style of editing is really really
calm and relaxing and peaceful to me I
just I really love it I suck at editing
my videos that's something that I've
always tried to do better but man I suck
at editing like so bad that little
effect that just happened that's as good
as it gets from me that's as far as it
goes but her lip swatch videos are
actually really cool like if you go on
her channel and you search up like her
doing lip swatches he makes my lip
swatches look like a kindergarten does
mine I just really like the effort the
time and the passion she puts into her
channel okay so this next person is also
pretty popular I actually do hear a lot
of people talk about emily noel but i
feel like she needs to be talked about
more she's another OG youtuber you saw
i've been watching her since before she
had her kid
like back in the day she's the youtuber
that got me into drugstore makeup which
I appreciate so much because a drugstore
is such a big part of my channel I love
drugstore makeup I'm constantly
reviewing it and she is the person I go
to when I really need a drugstore
opinion she really tests products out
before she gives her opinions I mean I
honestly trust her so much when it comes
to reviews she's awesome and she's also
a super dedicated youtuber because she'd
be filming these videos like at five
o'clock in the morning when there's like
no Sun out when her kids are sleeping
she takes the time to go sneak off and
film videos if that sounds dedication I
don't know what is cuz at five in the
morning and my arse is asleep in love it
so you're super mom Emily you're super
mom I need to give a shout-out to my
friend Josie that I like saying her name
like that we'll see if that Rosita Apple
boom
but now she's beauty by Rosita she's
another person I've been watching for a
long time and she's actually one of my
go-to channels because I feel like
Rosita and I think so similarly I don't
know if it's because she's a Scorpio and
I'm a Scorpio moon but when it comes to
makeup we always have the same opinion
on products it's crazy I mean not always
but most of the time we have the same
opinion on products so she's my go-to
person for a lot of things I love that
she's Hispanic and I know that really
doesn't matter to a lot of you but I
like the cheese is bad because I'm a
Latina so she's Latinas like you know
she knows her shiz when it comes to
makeup when it comes to like flash
photography
what foundations look good what
foundations last I always feel like I'm
discovering really really good stuff
when I watch her Channel
plus she's a perfume freak like I am I
feel like she is the only other youtuber
i watch that loves perfume as much as I
do
nobody talks about perfumes on their
Channel except me and we'll see that so
the next person I want to talk about is
someone who I think is getting so much
recognition and is getting finally what
she deserves and that is raw beauty
Christi I'm so happy for her she went on
a brand trip and realized that brands
are reaching out to other influencers
not just like the same ten that go on
these these brand trips I'm glad that
they're reaching out to different Beauty
vloggers and I'm so happy she got that
opportunity I started watching her
channel based on her talent alone and
I discovered that I really liked her
personality which is what kept me
watching her videos but she has awesome
tutorials like things that'll just blow
you away when you look at them things
aren't really hard to recreate at least
for me because I'm not not the best but
she just makes you want to play with
makeup I just love how artistic she is I
really get so inspired every time I
watch a video of hers and I just see her
doing big things like I just see her
going so far so I first discovered me
matang when the fancy Beauty Foundation
came out and she had a video that I
think went viral she was trying out the
darkest shade of the foundation and when
I discovered that video I went back on
her channel and I started watching like
all of her foundation videos she does
this thing where she tries out the
darkest shade in foundation ranges like
the darkest shade in the Fenty Beauty
one the darker shade in the new Marc
Jacobs shameless foundation like she
tries the darkest shade of foundations
which i thought was so cool and so
helpful for so many people because she
has a very deep skin tone I feel like
she kind of started something there and
it was just it was so interesting to me
I do not miss a foundation video from
Nima I love her voice I think she's so
pretty and just so soft-spoken I really
really like her videos I like the
quality of her videos if you haven't
checked out an email you totally should
so you definitely need to subscribe to
this next person if you are into
tutorials if you love watching people
put on makeup or do the whole tutorial
thing you need to follow easy neon I
think she is awesome she has so many
subscribers and yet I hear zero about
her and I love her talent because she's
very very talented she does great makeup
but everything looks so effortless like
she puts zero effort into her makeup and
it just looks flawless every time and I
love the way she edits her videos
everything is so relaxing her music is
awesome I just like watching her videos
they're very easy like her name I love
her accent I love I just love her face I
love her eyebrows I just love her looks
she does very natural looks and very
unique awesome looks as well so she's a
good one
alright so J kissa is another youtuber
that I watched religiously that I think
needs way more subscribers and she has I
mean she has a lot she is such a
the fresh air in the beauty community
she is just very different and unique
she never wears foundation which i think
is so nice because I know there's a ton
of people out there who don't like
foundation and who and who don't wear it
she's also extremely extremely talented
when it comes to her makeup her
eyeshadow looks always blow me away I
look at her makeup and I'm like dude how
did you you look so good she always
inspires me to want to play with color
just like Chrissy does they're just so
good with that JK says awesome when it
comes to that you feel like you need to
subscribe to her because I love her and
wonder where her sign is why do I get
the feeling she's a Scorpio wait wait
wait let me check midget I'm probably
gonna be wrong November 2nd bro party
did you see that I've gotten so good at
that anybody who tells me that they
don't let him in signs I'm talking to
you Chloe
Morello I might have gone on her Twitter
and seen that like subconsciously mmm
and I just told myself that because that
was just way too good that was just way
too good like how did I know that I look
good anyway so the last person I want to
talk about last but not least is Taylor
from the Taylor on YouTube I used to
think her channel was that Thalia so for
a long time I called her Thalia which
how embarrassing thank God I never said
that to her thank God I never called her
Thalia cuz that's not right
but I loved watching that Taylor I'm
obsessed with her channel she does a lot
of foundation videos and for some reason
I'm into foundation videos but she does
this thing called 15 days of foundation
where she tests out a different
foundation for 15 days in a row she does
this like every so often like every few
months and they're so interesting to me
I love those videos of her reviews even
though her and I have like totally
different skin types I mean now her skin
is getting a little bit more dry so I do
feel like I relate to her a little bit
more these days but even before when she
had really oily skin I just liked her
reviews I love her content and I love
that she's constantly putting out videos
and just constantly working on her
channel and always pumping out the juice
she's such a dedicated youtuber and I
love it and I love her personality I
just love how chill and relaxed she is
and she's not one of those people that
you're watching and you're like girl
calm down kind of like me you know like
I'm all over the place and I'm always
like
she's very calm and very cool she's like
she's cool hey guys those were 12 beauty
influencers that I think need to be
talked about more and I know that a lot
of those have a lot of subscribers like
I said this wasn't about subscriber
count' or views on videos I guess it's
just that whenever I would ask someone
what are the top 10 Beauty youtubers you
know it was always the same 10 and I
found that to be really really
interesting and I just thought I would
throw out some youtubers out there who I
think should be talked about more
and honestly I'm always on the hunt for
new youtubers and I know there's a bunch
of people out there who have very few
subscribers but deserve way more who
don't have nearly the subscriber count
that these people who I just mentioned
have I know there are so please don't be
upset what I want you to do is write it
in the comments below I want to know who
you think is completely underrated I
want to discover new Beauty vloggers
leave them in the comments below yet
