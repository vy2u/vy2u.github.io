my weekend morning routine specifically
on Sunday because that is the day I
recorded this and so in the mornings
everybody's asleep in the house
especially Cornelius he doesn't wake up
until we wake up so our mornings
basically consist of a lot of tossing
and turning a lot of Danny's hand in my
face because he can't sleep so well
neither can i apparently but yeah so
after laying and been half-asleep
half-awake for a couple of hours in the
morning I finally start to wake up
slowly
Danny wakes up really really early
throughout the week like 6:00 in the
morning so on the weekends he does like
to stay in as long as he can so when I'm
finally up I pretty much just sit in bed
and I mess with Danny for a while try to
get him to wake up and yeah my hair is
usually while it out in the mornings it
is out of cut to rope especially on
Sundays because that's the day I usually
iron my hair and I straighten it so
that's why it's looking a little frizzy
and curly so yeah I just mess with Danny
for a few minutes and then when I'm done
doing that it's time for me to get out
of bed
I just grabbed a hair tie and I pick my
hair up in a bun so that it is not in my
face
and then I just go on and start my day
and my little furry friend starts it
with me so I basically just go into my
bathroom and brush my teeth that's the
first thing I do in the morning it's the
first thing I hope everyone does in the
morning so I just take my toothbrush and
my toothpaste and I begin to brush my
teeth I don't wash my face in this
bathroom I do that in the guest bathroom
because I get better lighting in that
one since it does have a window and I
get natural light and this light is a
little bit too yellow for me so I do
like my host skincare regimen in the
guest bathroom I just brush my teeth in
ours
so after I brush my teeth I head over to
the kitchen to make myself a cup of
coffee because mama loves coffee and a
cat good enough
and usually Cornelius is just waiting
for me on the couch because you know you
can't live without me if it's rough it's
rough life
so I just make my way towards the
kitchen and I get my coffee cup and I
usually go for any coffee that is medium
roast or dark roast
I like intense coffee that's just my
choice so it isn't really matter what
brand I really like the donut brand
actually I think it's called donut shop
I just didn't have any today but yeah I
just fill my little coffee cup up I
actually do like the medium mug size not
the full mug just a medium mug and
that's usually enough for me and I don't
like to add sugar to my coffee I just
use my fat-free and sugar-free hazelnut
toasted hazelnut from international
delight I don't like to make my coffee
too sweet plus too much sugar is not
good for me like you usually get really
bad some aches from too much sugar so I
try to keep my coffee sugar free most of
the time actually like a hundred percent
of the time and I like my coffee room
temperature so I just let my coffee sit
there while I go on to my skincare
routine so in the mornings I just take
my cognac sponge this is from the brand
one love true organics but I use any
cognac sponge to wash my face it's my
favorite tool to wash my face it's
really gentle and it's amazing
then I take my fresh soy face cleanser
this is my favorite morning cleanser for
some reason I don't know if it's like
the texture or like the cucumber a scent
it just wakes my skin up like it leaves
my face feeling really really fresh and
the fact that it is so natural and
gentle it works for my sensitive skin I
don't know I just don't know what it is
about this but it is my favorite
favorite morning face wash and it
doesn't foam up too much so it doesn't
dry out my skin you guys know I have
really dry skin and this just works
wonders for my skin and just I love it
in the morning after that I just rinse
my face off with some water and then I
press a towel against my face to dry my
face up and then I move on to my serum I
like to use in my L'Oreal texture
Perfector serum I like this one it's
from the drugstore it's not super super
affordable but it's pretty affordable
compared to all the other serums you
know from like Sephora and stuff and it
does the job I like it so I just add one
thin pump to my fingers and then I
massage it on my face and then I like to
add a moisturizer on top with a little
bit of SPF since it is a daytime I use
my origins by the zing this has SPF 15
and it does have a sheer tint formula so
I like to squeeze a little bit out into
my fingers and then massage it in my
fingers first and then apply it to my
face because it is tinted and it gives
off like a nice warm color and it leaves
your face glowing it's just a really
really nice daytime moisturizer and I
love that it is tinted it's just not a
basic white moisturizer I love it
and then I go on to my hair and makeup I
just go to my desk and sip on my coffee
and then I usually turn on some music I
usually use Pandora and it really
depends on how I'm feeling I think what
music I like to listen to but most of
the time I put on my girl Billie Holiday
because she's my fate so um yeah I don't
know but usually on Sundays I like to
iron my hair that's why my Flatiron is
sitting there in the corner but I
usually like to iron my hair after I've
already had breakfast so I just take my
hair out of my bun and unleash the
untamed beast and I will be ironing my
hair later on that day after I have
breakfast so for now I just used some
Moroccan oil in my hair any type of oil
you guys know I'm obsessed with like
argan oil or any type of serum for my
hair today I am using Moroccan oil but I
switch it up all the time and then I
just put a headband on to take the hair
out of my face for some reason I cannot
eat breakfast the second I wake up
because I get a really bad stomach ache
I don't know what it is so I have to
wait about an hour before I eat
breakfast so anyway on a day-to-day
basis when I'm not filming or I'm just
gonna be home I don't put on makeup but
this day actually Danny and I went out
to Target and we did a couple of things
so I'm just putting on some minimal
makeup I am using my Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow Wiz in brunette and I am just
filling in my eyebrows very very lightly
nothing too crazy not the bold brow I
usually do then after I just take some
concealer here I'm using my Maybelline
fit me concealer in the shade 15 fair
and I am just focusing on covering my
dark circles I'm not here to highlight
or anything like that I'm just trying to
cover up the darkness underneath my eyes
and the redness around
nose and the birthmark in between my
forehead or my eyebrows I should say
then I'm just going to take my Real
Techniques expert face brush and I'm
just going to buff all of that in I'm
also going to blend some of this
concealer on top of my eyelids just to
cancel out any of the redness on my
eyelids and cover up the veins
then I'm just going to take my MSF
natural in the shade medium this is from
Mac and my ELF kabuki brush and I'm just
gonna lightly dust this all over my face
to give my face just a little bit of
coverage and to set the concealer I
almost didn't over stay there and to set
the concealer I had just put down I'm
just going to warm up my face a little
bit because the concealer tends to wash
me out so I'm just taking my NYC bronzer
in Montauk bronze and I'm literally
putting this everywhere as you can tell
I'm not being too precise with this I'm
just warming up my skin
then I'm just going to add some mascara
here I'm using my Maybelline colossal
volume Express Emily that's what it's
called and I just add a couple of coats
of this mascara
I don't know don't ask and I also coat
my bottom lashes as well
and then I just take my hair out of this
headband and wiggle my hair around a
little bit try to tame it a little bit
somewhat sort of okay and then I just
finish off with some chapstick so after
this I'll just go have some breakfast
with Danny and then I will come back in
the room and iron my hair and just go on
with my day but I hope you enjoyed this
video this is usually what I do in the
mornings on Sundays or Saturdays nothing
too crazy or glamorous just you know me
in my everyday life I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching bye
yeah
now this is my morning routine not our
morning routine wasn't a lot but it was
trying to steal the spotlight from me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
