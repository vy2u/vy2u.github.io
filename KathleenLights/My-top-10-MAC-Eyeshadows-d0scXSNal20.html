just want to point out something really
quick I know that I seem like a crazy
person
and the last couple of video in my last
in all my last videos because I look
like just like a creep sitting in a room
with absolutely no fine furniture but um
finally um I'm getting my vanity in a
couple of days my husband is building me
humanity he is a builder in the Navy so
he knows what he's doing
and um he's like he made me he's making
me vanity and I'm finally getting it in
a couple of days so I just wanted to
point that out just in case you're like
why is she what wait what is what I
wanted to show you guys the top 10 Mac
eyeshadows that I love the most out of
all the ones that I own I don't own a
whole bunch I don't have like stacks and
stacks of these things but out of the
ones that I do own the 10 that I love
the most
they're not in any special order I love
these all the same except for the first
one that I'm going to show you which is
my favorite eyeshadow of all time now
before I get started I do want to
apologize because I'm not going to be
showing them to you individually I mean
I'm going to be showing them to you in
this thing and for some reason they do
not want to come out they're like stuck
in here I don't know what I did they do
not come out okay so the first eyeshadow
I'm going to be showing you like I said
is my absolute favorite of all time and
it is this one right here it is max
amber lights and a lot of people like to
think that this is a gold eyeshadow I
personally don't see it so gold as I do
like a coppery Orange in the summer I
wore this non-stop you have no idea this
is the prettiest eyeshadow I've ever
seen okay so this is amber light it's so
beautiful my god I'm just going to be
taking half-baked from the Naked palette
to put next to it just because it's like
the closest gold eyeshadow I have to me
so that's half baked and you can see
half baked is a very true gold so amber
lights next a gold you can see that it's
pretty much not gold at all it's like a
it's pretty much like a burnt I don't
know how to explain it it's just
beautiful
those that I shadow are in no particular
order I love them all the same I just
kind of wanted to show amber lights
because it is my favorite and it's where
I got my youtube name and it sounds so
lame my youtube name is Kathleen light
it said I got it from the eye shadow and
I know that makes me really lame but
that's how much I love this eye shadow
my next favorite is rule and it is just
this one right here and I know it looks
really scary because it's orange there's
no other way to describe this eye shadow
it is Orange it's a matte color and this
is what it looks like close up right
here I love this color I know it can be
a little bit scary because it's so
bright and orange but um this will warm
up any look and you just dab your crease
brush into this color and lightly put
this into the crease it will warm up
anything and make anything look
beautiful and yeah this is what it looks
like swatched I think it's gorgeous
I will say that I tend to gravitate more
towards warmer colors just because I
feel like they complement my eyes more
the next one is a much more wearable
green than your average just bright
green eyeshadow it is this one right
here and it's called sumptuous olive and
this color is just so perfect because it
has a hint of gold I don't know if you
can tell but it definitely isn't
completely green so I think it's a lot
more wearable and it's just beautiful
and this is what it looks like swapped I
don't have any primer on my hands at all
this is just a flat true color swatch
and it doesn't look as nice swatched on
my hand but I promise you it looks
beautiful on the lid under primer it's
it just has like a Goldy hint it's a
really nice green the next one is a
purple and I love purple eyeshadows
because I feel like they complement
green eye and it is this color right
here it is called Trax
it's my favorite purple to wear and I
think I love it so much because it has
like gold glitter in it when you put it
all over your lid there's like a hint of
gold and it's amazing this is what it
looks watch as you can see it when I
move my hand
you can see that gold it's just it's
beautiful on the lid keep in mind that
these eyeshadows look a lot better
under primer I mean on top of primer
than they do just watch on my hand I'm
trying to go through this
I know quickly because I don't want to
sit here and talk about when I shot up
for like 50 years that's that's not fun
the next one is this one right here and
it is called the cranberry and my god I
can't say enough good things about this
color this is the perfect fall color and
I actually think it's just one of those
colors that you can wear year-round I
don't know that a lot of people may not
agree with me but I've worn this color
in the summer with like amber lights or
just like a light brown and it just it
oh my god is so beautiful I don't care
what time of year it is it is the most I
don't known this color is amazing the
next one is called nylon and it looks it
suits right here I will show a close-up
and it's just a second I first got this
eyeshadow because my best friend
um owns it and it looked amazing on her
she has dark skin though and it looked
amazing and look the gold it looked like
a very white kind of gold and looked
great so I was like oh my god I need to
pick me up that color it's good so I
bought it and it didn't look quite the
same as it did on her because I'm much
much wider than her and I was like oh I
mean obviously it wasn't going to look
the same but then I ended up falling in
love with it anyway because it's like
the prettiest inner tear-duct highlight
color I have it here in my uterus and I
have it under my brow bone and it's just
one of those colors that a little goes a
long way and it looks amazing I love
this as a highlight color and I know
that it's really dramatic um shroom
would be more ideal for just an everyday
highlight but when you want to get a
little dramatic this one is amazing okay
so this is what it looks like right
there and let me just swatch it on my
hand first so you can see it's just like
a metallic e white it's crazy
um the next one I'm going to show you I
have it in my little elf quad right here
and surprise surprise it's called all
that glitters and I know that
I talked about this but there's a reason
why everybody talks about this it's this
one right here it's like a rolls
Goldie pink champagne
oh my god if that I haven't made any
sense and this is what it looks like
swatched if you happen to want one of
those colors to just slap on the rest of
your lid uh um all that glitters is
definitely that color it looks a lot
darker on my hand right now that i
swatched it nice are we talking about I
really don't hear a lot of people
talking about it I mean maybe I'm wrong
but it's called mulch I love the word I
don't know why I love what it's called
mulch mulch it is this one right here
and it's just a bronzy brown but just
like a lot of my favorites it has like
gold reflex glitter in it I don't know
it's just your typical bronze eyeshadow
and I'm sure you can find a couple of
tips for this but I do I do really love
it the next one I'm going to be showing
you I don't personally love on my eyes
just because I do have green eyes and I
don't think that green like a true green
eyeshadow complements green eyes at all
and it is called humid and it's just
this one right here where it just
because it is a beautiful color just as
a compliment my green eyes as much as
like tracks does for example you know
and it is just a forest green very very
beautiful it's just your typical forest
green that's awesome and my last one is
probably my only cool toned eyeshadow
that I'm gonna show you and it is called
silver ring and the reason why I love
this so much as opposed to like any
other basic silver eyeshadow is because
there's a hint of blue in it I don't
know if you can tell I mean I don't know
if it's just me but it definitely has
like a blue to it it's just a pretty
silver I've ever worked with personally
I love this okay so that is it that what
those were my top 10 favorite Mac
eyeshadows that I owned like I said
there are a few that I want to own that
I think are just as good as those but I
don't own them yet um I will say there's
a bunch of my eyeshadows out
that are not worth buying because you
can get the same color at the drugstore
for example let me show you something
really fast okay so I bought carbon
because everybody was like oh my god
carbon it's the best matte black color
I've ever seen carbons amazing so I
bought it sure it's a decent color but
then I went to my little local Walgreens
and I bought this wet and wild single
eyeshadow in Panther and it is a matte
black eyeshadow let me show you
something really fast you guys ready for
this watch this this is max carbon and
this is when wild Panther this thing was
a dollar Carvin was fifteen bucks it is
crazy how much darker Panther is and
then I started looking around my other
matte black eyeshadow like black out
from The Naked 2 this that is a dark
black that is a nice really dark darker
than Panther even dark black panther's
really dark though Carbon sucks like I
can't even stress enough how bad carbon
is the pigmentation is not there at all
is so not worth it if you're looking for
a really good matte black eyeshadow I
suggest getting Pantha from what a wild
it is a dollar I know that this has
nothing to do with the video but I just
wanted to point out that there are some
Mac eye shadows that really aren't worth
it so yeah I hope you liked this video
and I hope you found it helpful and um
if there was any eye shadows that I
showed you that you were interested and
hopefully you know now you're convinced
to whether you want it or not so thank
you for watching this video and police
these please don't forget to subscribe
for more videos and thanks for watching
