video because it is a review on the
brand-new Urban Decay Naked 3 palette
and if you guys follow me on Instagram
you were probably laughing right now and
for those of you who don't I'll tell you
why
the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette launched
last night at Sephora at 9 o'clock at
night
yesterday was the 11th and Danny tried
to sneak away and say that he went to go
buy cigarettes and he actually went to
go get me the Naked 3 palette and he was
gotten away with it except the gas
station is down the street from our
house and he was gone for like half an
hour and I was like wait a second
so I completely busted him and when he
got home I was like I know you were at
Sephora and this was supposed to be a
Christmas gift but since I caught him
red-handed he decided to go ahead and
give it to me early so anyway I don't
want to ramble I want to go ahead and
get into the review I will be showing
you swatches in this video as well so
this is what the box looks like it just
says naked 3 on it and when you open it
it comes with deep palette and this
little guy right here which is for
samples of the different primer potions
they come in little pouches like this
they give you the original in sin and an
anti-aging primer and it does come with
decent amount of product but I'm a
little bit bummed about this because
when you bought the original Naked
palette it actually came with a mini
primer potion which even though this
does have a lot of product in it and you
get four you can't reseal them so they
will dry out really quickly I would
assume you would only get a couple of
uses out of this before it just gets too
sticky and dry so I would have preferred
it coming with like a tiny little primer
potion instead and the Naked 2 palette
came with like a tiny little lip gloss
so I think they could have done a little
better with it but anyway so the actual
packaging looks like this it is pretty
much identical to the Naked 2 palette in
terms of the fact that it comes in like
a tin like this and to be honest this
packaging doesn't bother me I know a lot
of people have had problems with their
Naked 2 palette breaking but so far I
haven't had
any problem with it I do prefer the
original Naked palette packaging it just
seems more sleek and sophisticated but
the packaging doesn't bother me it also
comes with a little double-sided um I
shadow brush which is extremely similar
to the Naked 2 palette only The Naked 2
palette has like a domed crease brush
this one just has like a fluffy eye
shadow brush these brushes aren't my
favorite they are really good for
concealer and packing on eyeshadow like
if you use eyeshadow with fix+ and stuff
this is really good to pack on some
eyeshadow but besides that I don't
really use these a whole bunch so onto
the actual colors these are the
beautiful colors that are inside this
palette it comes with a huge mirror by
the way there are 12 I shadow in this
palette and the palette does cost $52 by
the way the same price as the original
and the Naked 2 there are twelve
eyeshadows and they are very like pink
based they all have like a dusty rose
pinky Mavi plummy undertone to them so
if you're not into those kind of colors
I would stay far away from this palette
because pretty much every eyeshadow has
that undertone I'm going to go ahead and
show you these swatches of these
eyeshadows and then I'll talk a little
bit more about how I feel about the
palette the first one is called strange
and it is just a matte creamy white
color it is really similar to walk of
shame from Urban Decay but it's not as
pink it is definitely more pink than
yellow though but I like that they have
a really light matte color in this
palette because that is the problem I
had with the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette
the color foxy even though it was matte
and it was light it was just pretty much
the exact same color as my skin so it
didn't show up on my skintone at all but
this one definitely does I have this one
underneath my brow bone and and in the
tear duct the second one is dust and it
was the one that I was most disappointed
with in the entire palette it comes off
super chunky and chalky you pretty much
can get any pigmentation with this
eyeshadow it's just honest
like a light wash of glitter which isn't
my favorite the third one is burnout and
this is such a beautiful color it's
definitely one of my favorites it's just
like you like champagne color but with a
lot of pink it's like a pink champagne
and it goes on beautifully on the lids I
have that right on the inner half of my
lid and I and I just think it's so
beautiful the fourth one is called limit
and it is a light mauve shade it is
matte so this is perfect for the crease
it's going to be your transition shade
that's what I have in my crease right
now and it blends so beautifully the
matte shades in this palette are so nice
and not chalky I mean what can you
expect that Urban Decay but it is a
really nice Mavi pink this one here is
buzz and it is such a beautiful like
metallic pink that's the only way I can
describe it I shadow is just like a
metallic pink it looks beautiful all
over the lid it is gorgeous
then we have this one right here and
it's called trick and it is the only one
to me that like stands out out of the
entire palette because it's gold but
even though it is gold it does have a
pink undertone it actually is a really
unique eyeshadow I don't have any
eyeshadows that look like that it's
really pretty that is what I have right
on the center of my lids that pop of
gold I have on the center of my lids
it's that one trick then for my absolute
favorite eyeshadow in this entire
palette is this one right here and it's
called nooner it's also very similar to
limit where it's like a mauve color but
it's a lot darker that's actually what I
have like on the top of my crease right
here I used it to blend out the darker
colors and it just made it so like blown
out and smoky and I love that shade this
one is another one of my favorites it's
called liar and it's just a pinky taupe
that's pretty much what it is it's a
nice taupe color but with some pinky
purple light undertones this next one is
called Factory and it's like a mid-tone
brown with a hint of Plum enus to it it
is really nice then we have mugshot and
it is also a nice taupe color it's
really similar to liar only liar is a
lot more pink and mugshot is a little
bit
or gray then we have dark side and it's
pretty much your charcoal gunmetal color
it's what I have on the outer part of my
eyes just to deepen it up make it a
little bit more smoky then the last one
is black heart and it's just a matte
black eyeshadow but it has a ton of tiny
little reddish purpley pink II kind of
glitter all through it but i found that
when i swatched it some of the glitter
did fall out like the glitter kind of
went away but it does do a nice job of
deepening out the outer corner making it
really deep in sultry I actually really
like this color I think that if you were
to pack on pack it on your lid with like
some fix+ or something like that then
the glitter would really stand out but
if you just do it on its own a lot of
the glitter is going to like blend away
so those are the swatches of the Naked 3
palette I hope that the swatch has
helped you and show you more or less
what the colors look like because
sometimes in the pan you can't really
tell what they're gonna look like as far
what I think about this palette I do
think that it is absolutely beautiful I
think that anything that aramid ek comes
out with is beautiful I wasn't gonna buy
it because when I had seen swatches
online I was not feeling it at all I was
like oh my god too much pink I never
wear pink on my eyes I was just I was
just not I was not gonna get it I was
not into it at all but then I went Danny
went out and got it for me and I was
playing with it last night and I was
playing with it today it's what I have
all over my eyes right now I was like
wow it actually is really pretty and
since I don't have a lot of eyeshadows
with these kind of undertones I think
that I would probably get some use out
of this to me personally I think it is
really different from these two palettes
I think I don't think they're comparable
this one is very very bronzy and warm
and this one is a little bit cooler but
with all the pinks and the plums and the
moms in this palette I don't think you
can compare them do I think that this
would be good for everyday sure these
light colors could be used on a
day-to-day basis like limit and nooner I
think that would make perfect eyes
shadows for everyday and
yeah I think that this would work do I
think this is an absolute necessity no I
think if you have either one of these
pallets I don't think you need this one
if your preference is more cool tone I
think it would be good just having the
Naked 2 palette and if you're more into
warm tones I think you would be just
good having their original Naked palette
I don't think you absolutely need this
but if you're someone who is a fan of
these kind of undertones in your
eyeshadow then yes I think it's worth it
even if you do have these like I think
this would be the perfect palette for
blue eyes okay so that's it these were -
okay I said these were my thoughts on me
on the new Naked 3 palette stuff that I
got you girl
