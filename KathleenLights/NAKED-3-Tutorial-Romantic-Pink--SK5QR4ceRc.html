Valentine's Day tutorial I said that I
would be posting like two more this is
the second look I came up with and I'm
using the very obvious Naked 3 palette I
know there's tons of Valentine's Day
tutorials with this palette but a bunch
of you requested that I do a Valentine's
they look with the palette so that's
what I did and this is what I came up
with I only used one other eyeshadow
that wasn't in this palette but it's a
purple and you can find for anywhere I
actually really like this look because
it is really really simple it's a nice
light pink blush like pink lips and like
a pinky purple eye and I just think it's
nice and sweet and soft and romantic so
for those of you who like that soft and
romantic look this one is perfect for
you so let me know down below if you
like this tutorial and if you want to
see how to get this look then just keep
watching I'm going to start off by
priming my eyelids with Too Faced shadow
insurance then I'm going to take the
color limit in The Naked 3 palette and
this is gonna be my transition color I'm
taking it on a fluffy brush and I'm just
sloppily gonna put this all over my
crease and some of my eye as well then
I'm taking the color buzz in the palette
and I am going to apply this all over my
lid with a flat shader brush
the pigmentation on this eyeshadow isn't
the best as you can probably tell so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a little bit of a fix plus and
spray that on my brush and then dip it
back into the eyeshadow and apply it
like that then I'm going to take nooner
and on my 217 I am just going to quickly
blend the harsh edge of that eyeshadow
now I'm going to take my wet and wild
lust palette this is the other eyeshadow
I'm using for this tutorial but you can
use any matte purple this is a dupe for
Mac's
big one if you have the eyeshadow then
use that one but I'm just going to take
my Mac 217 and I'm going to start
applying this eyeshadow on the outer
view of my eye and then drag it up into
the crease
now I'm going to take limit which is the
first eyeshadow we use and do the exact
same thing I'm going to just blend this
into my crease so that everything blends
nicely and really quickly I'm just going
to tightline and line my waterline with
the Maybelline master drama eyeliner I'm
going to take this flat little angled
brush from ELF and I'm going to dip it
into Mac's
carbon and I'm going to start creating a
line I didn't want to use gel or liquid
liner because I didn't want it to be too
harsh I want it to be really really soft
next I'm taking black art from the
palette and I'm going to start stamping
this on the outer view of my eye and
then dragging it in so it fades nicely I
just want to add a little bit of
definition to the outer view of my eye
for my highlight I am taking strange and
I'm applying this underneath my brow
bone and in my inner tear duct
I'm going to go back into that buzz
color with some more fix+ and apply it
right in the center of my lid to give it
that metallic pop then I'm just gonna
add some mascara and I'm going to move
on to the rest of my face I already put
my foundation and concealer on just to
save some time but I'll list it down
below what I used also I forgot to
record it but I added some eyeshadow to
the lower lash line I added nooner from
the palette I just smudged that
underneath my lashes and then I added
some mascara so for my bronzer I am
using the NYC bronzer in Montauk bronze
and I wanted my face to be very very
simple which is why I didn't contour or
anything like that
I'm just bronzing up my face a little
bit for my blush I am using the L'Oreal
True Match blush in baby blossom it's a
light baby pink it's really pretty so
I'm taking that on my it cosmetics blush
brush and I am just applying a very very
subtle amount to my cheeks and then the
Sun one away but I'm using my Becca
highlight in moonstone to highlight my
cheekbones
I am using the Revlon pink pouty Super
Lustrous lipstick and then I am topping
it off with the buxom lipgloss in white
Russian
okay guys so that is the finished look I
hope you liked this tutorial thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
