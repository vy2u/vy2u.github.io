hey guys so today's video is a makeup
tutorial on the makeup I'm wearing right
now and it is using the brand new urban
decay and Naked 3 palette this is the
look that I was wearing in my Naked 3
review and swatches that I posted the
other day and a bunch of you guys said
you wanted to see a tutorial on the
makeup I was wearing in the video so you
ask and you shall receive by the way I
am going to be doing a few more
tutorials with this palette
I've got a bunch in the works they're
all cooking in my brain right now so
stay tuned for those videos coming soon
just because I feel like a lot of people
have been getting this palette recently
or you guys are getting it for Christmas
it's popular it's very popular right now
so I figured it'd be really cool to do
just a couple more tutorials with this
palette but this tutorial specifically
is a little special because I am doing
it with my friend Shireen she is
probably the first person I met on
YouTube and she was just so nice to me
right off the bat she gave me like a
little shout out in her video when I had
like 25 subscribers and I thought it was
the sweetest thing and we text all the
time she has become a really good friend
of mine we talk about makeup all the
time we're just like a bunch of girly
girls talking back and forth so we
decided it would be a good idea for both
of us to upload tutorials using this
palette she is doing a more daytime
appropriate look and this is more like a
sultry evening type of look I would I
would totally wear this during the day
but for people who don't like this much
eyeshadow during the day I think this
would be a beautiful date night look
because it's just it's really sultry and
romantic and I think that this would
look so beautiful on pretty much every
single eye color like literally this
will look amazing on brown eyes like
amazing so I'm going to go ahead and
link shereen's channel down below make
sure you go check her out and watch her
daytime look using this Naked palette
and if you want to see how I got this
makeup look just keep watching first
thing I'm doing is taking Mac painterly
paint-pot and I'm going to be using this
to prime my eyelids now I'm taking this
color right here it's called limit and
this is just going to be my transition
I'm just pretty much sloppily putting
this all over my crease
then I'm taking this color right here
it's called mugshot it's a really pretty
taupe --is-- kind of color and I am
putting this all over my lid with a flat
shader brush
then I'm just taking this color right
here it is called liar and I'm going to
layer that on top of that mugshot color
just because I wanted to give it more of
a mauve a type of shade instead of a
topi kind of shade if that makes any
sense now going in with nooner I'm just
going to start blending this into my
crease just to blend away those little
harsh lines this is like my favorite
eyeshadow of all time it's beautiful now
going in with this color right here
called darkside I'm just using this to
deepen out my outer V a little bit I
start on the outer V and then kind of
bring it in and then I'm adding some
into my crease as well like very precise
in the hollows of my crease I don't want
this to go too far past my crease
then I'm just going to line my waterline
and my tightline with Maybelline
eyeliner in Midnight Master now I'm
taking this color right here called
burnout it's a really nice soft
champagne II kind of pink and I'm just
going to brighten the inner corners of
my eyes with this eye shadow and also
take it on my inner tear-duct
just a little bit now taking the
lightest shade in the palette this is
going to be my brow bone highlight going
back into nooner I'm really going to be
putting this in my crease right now I
want it to be very far up and blown out
so that's what I'm doing right now I'm
just packing on that color a lot into my
crease I'm also taking that strange
shade and putting it in my inner
tear-duct as well now taking black heart
I'm just going to deepen out the outer V
just a little bit more I feel like it
really makes it a little bit more sultry
and smoky ish so I'm just packing that
on with a tiny little flat shader brush
just to deepen it a little bit
now I'm taking this color trick and I'm
using my finger to put this right in the
center of my eyelids just to give it
that little pop of gold I'm blending out
my lower lash line with that nooner
shade and then I'm going to take black
heart and add some of that color just to
make it a little bit more smoky then I'm
going to add some mascara and I am using
Jordana's best lash extreme and then
this will complete the eyes really
quickly though I'm just going to breeze
past my face just because I know some
people just wanted to see and eye
tutorial but some people like to see the
whole face application process so I'm
just priming my face with the hard candy
sheer envy primer and then I'm taking my
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation and
I'm applying that all over my face with
my Real Techniques what is it's called
complexion perfection sponge I think
that's the name
now I'm taking my Maybelline instant age
rewind dark circle eraser and I am just
cleaning up underneath the eyes and
covering some of those dark circles
I'm going to set that with my MSF
natural in medium now taking my little
hoola bronzer I'm just going to be
contouring with this I'm watching a
YouTube video as I am filming this
that's why I'm like looking to the side
youtuber at heart that's all I do watch
using videos that's my life and then I
got really hot look how red my ear is it
like freaked me out I was so hot anyway
I'm taking my favorite blush of all time
you guys know it is Mac's Melba and then
I'm just gonna be popping that on my
cheeks as my blush I think it
complements these eyes really really
well and I'm just going to highlight
with my Mac soft and gentle
and then I had to pick up my hair a
little bit because I was burning so hot
I'm taking my NYX soft matte lip cream
in the color Tokyo and I'm just gonna
dab that on my lips and then kind of
blend it out just to give it a soft pink
color but then I'm topping it off with
my NYX butter gloss and creme brulee and
that is the end of this tutorial thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
