a foundation routine I'm going to be
showing you how I get a really natural
face using the bare minerals original
foundation a bunch of you guys wanted to
see how I use this bad boy so that's
what I'm doing today I sound like a mad
Donna I feel like I've been losing my
voice since this morning it's like I
woke up and I sounded like Vin Diesel
but anyway let's try look past that
I love the bare minerals original
foundation especially on days where I
don't want so much coverage I want
something really natural and light and
this is perfect for that because this is
mineral makeup which is good for your
skin it doesn't clog your pores it
doesn't do anything bad which is awesome
for sensitive gals like myself and my
favorite part about this is that it is
not cakey a powder foundation that
doesn't kick up on me that's like that's
unheard of as I say in every video I
have really dry skin like really dry
skin and powder looks so bad on my skin
but this shows up beautifully on my skin
because it has kind of like a luminosity
to it which I can't explain um it's not
like completely flat it's not shimmering
by any means but there's just like a
glow factor to it I don't know how I
explained it and it just makes your skin
look really really healthy and radiant I
love this so I'm going to be showing you
how I apply it
my little foundation routine with this
guy so the first thing I do is I always
apply fix+ to my face before I go in
with this just because I feel like it
really hydrates my face I just spray a
crap ton of that stuff all over my face
and just kind of let it sink in I love
mac fix+
it's like hydrates my face really really
well and then I go in with some
concealer because this is such a light
coverage foundation it doesn't really
cover blemishes or anything like that so
I do like to take some concealer and
cover any of my like red patches or
pimples that I might have so I'm using
the yeah B concealer in the color buff
and I just basically add this wherever I
have a lot of redness around my nose
in between my forehead
in on random little blemishes
I have a crazy creepy vein right here on
my mouth that looks like a moustache
it's not a moustache
it's like this dark vein that goes down
to my neck can you guys see that see
bizarre I look like I know what why why
if I have such a large vein there I
don't know so then after that I just
take some under-eye concealer and this
is the Maybelline instant age rewind
dark circle eraser in the color fair and
I just pop some underneath my eyes
because I get really bad dark circles
and then I just blend that in
then typically I would go ahead and set
that with my Mac MSF natural but since I
am using a powder foundation I just go
ahead and set my whole face with the
bare minerals foundation the two
different brushes I like to use with
this foundation is the Sigma angled
kabuki and the Real Techniques buffing
brush these both work really well today
I'm going to be using the buffing brush
I just feel like it buffs the foundation
into my skin very nicely so basically I
just take the cap off and then sprinkle
some into the cap by the way my shade is
medium beige if I even mention that at
all I don't remember
I have bad memory then I just take my
brush and kind of dip it into the cap
and then take off the excess and then I
just start to apply it to my face
I first like to stipple this on I know
that that may seem weird but I feel like
it distributes a product better I don't
know but I just kind of dab it onto my
face first and now go and I'll buff
everything in
you
and it is pretty buildable because the
places where I have the most redness or
right here on my cheeks and when I do
like two or three layers of it it
doesn't look cakey at all which is what
I love
it doesn't make cakey you can do all the
layering you want and it'll still look
really good okay so this is what my face
looks like after I finish putting on the
foundation I just add a couple more
layers so the places where I get a
little bit more redness like in between
my forehead and right here on my cheeks
and it does a good job of layering I
feel I don't know if you can tell on
camera but there is like you probably
can't tell but in person my face looks
like it's glowing there's like a
luminosity or a glow like there's a lot
of radiance to this foundation I don't
know which I think is what makes this
foundation so beautiful and it kind of
stops it from looking cakey or too
powdery my face does not look powdery
whatsoever really quickly though I'm
going to go ahead and put on the rest of
my face makeup and I'll be right back
I'm back okay so basically I am obsessed
with this foundation I have been wearing
it every day to work I don't wear makeup
every day but whenever I go to work I
use this as opposed to like a full
coverage foundation I only added a
little bit of highlight to my cheekbones
um like literally a tiny bit just so you
can see like how luminous and glowing my
face looks um with this thing alone with
that being said I'm afraid that people
with oily skin might not like this
foundation I don't know I could be wrong
since it's a powder and not a liquid
maybe in my work for oily skin I don't
know I don't have a way a skin so I
can't tell you if you do have oily skin
and if you have tried this before let me
know down below what you think about it
but I do think this would work wonders
for normal to dry skin like I said the
coverage isn't amazing but it is really
good if you have a lot of breakouts just
use some concealer and then put this on
top and I think you'd be good to go for
those of you girls with oily skin though
there is
a bareMinerals matte powder foundation
it looks just like this only instead of
it saying original it says matte and
I've heard that that works for oily skin
so definitely check out the matte
version of this if you're looking into
mineral makeup you know you want
something that's better for your skin
but you don't want this version because
it's a little bit too like luminous or
whatever try the matte one by the way I
do recommend that you use a primer with
this just because sometimes if I don't
use a primer I didn't use a primer today
but whenever I don't use a primer I feel
like it sinks into my pores just a
little bit like not something that's
crazy noticeable you can't see it from a
distance at all or if I'm looking in the
mirror right now I can't really tell but
throughout the day I notice that it'll
sink into my pores just a little bit but
whenever I use a pore minimizing primer
that doesn't happen so just keep that in
mind if you do have like large pores or
anything like that okay guys so that's
