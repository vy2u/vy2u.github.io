ready for this video so I got something
in the mail that was super top secret
and I'm pretty sure that the product was
revealed yesterday on like social media
and stuff so you probably have already
heard but colour-pop has foundations
that's right that's right that's right
no filter foundation oh yeah baby oh
yeah look at this look at this I have
been waiting for this ever since they
launched there no filter concealers
everybody has been asking for this this
is a $12 foundation okay it is full
coverage long wearing natural matte
finish
42 shades so in today's video I'm going
to be walking you through this
foundation this is going to be a
foundation review it's not a first
impressions and it gets better color pop
also released two different no filter
powders so they have their setting
powder and their sheer pressed powder
the setting powder comes in this
packaging it's like a loose setting
powder you have translucent banana and
medium deep the banana is like that
typical like yellowy powder and then you
have six different pressed powders and
you can use these to set your face like
to set your foundation set your makeup
and then these are better for underneath
the eyes and I've been texting Jordan
all morning to figure out what the
prices of these powders because it's not
on this packaging at all and she hasn't
responded to my text oh wait there
bubbles bubbles no never mind
I'm sure she'll respond before I put
this video up so I will leave the price
of the loose powders right here and then
the price the pressed powders right here
they might be the same price I don't
know we'll see really quickly I do want
to say I know I'm very close to color
pop me and Jordan are very good friends
she works that color pop and I have a
lot of collabs with them we do a lot of
things together but that will never ever
sway how I feel about a product I think
because I'm so close to color pop and
they know how I am they know that I
would never fake the funk pretend to
like something I don't like and I think
that they really appreciate that they
appreciate my feedback I'm constantly
always giving them my feedback and I
think that they like that even if it's
bad feedback because I've given them bad
feedback plenty of times in the past
okay so like I said
is the codecop nofilter foundation it
comes in 42 shades and they sent me a
bunch of samples and then three
full-size foundations depending on what
they thought my color would be and I've
been trying this foundation out this is
actually the third time I'm gonna put it
on my face because I really wanted to
test out a couple of times before I gave
you my opinion first two times I wore
this foundation I actually wore the
shade light 50 but I do think it is a
little bit too fair for me so I am gonna
be mixing in light sixty five actually I
might just wear your lights yeah I'm
gonna wear just light sixty five so this
is what the foundation looks like it
comes in a glass bottle and it comes
with a pump which is awesome the bottle
is really really nice I love these stars
if you guys know me you know I'm a
squeezy two gal if I had to choose the
best foundation packaging I say it's a
squeezy tube because I could drop this
and it can break and the squeeze tube
cannot break so but overall I do love
this packaging mine didn't come with a
cap I'm assuming because it came in the
PR set I think that when you buy the
foundation it will most likely come with
a cap but the really cool thing about
this pump is that it does lock when you
twist it back it locks and you can't
click it anymore so you can travel with
this even without the top okay so I'm
gonna zoom you in and we could jump into
the review for the first time I use this
I used it with a primer I always use and
then I did half of my face with a brush
and half of my face with a Beauty
Blender and I absolutely hated hated the
way it looked with a brush it looked a
little bit too cakey like I don't expand
it looked like I had makeup sitting on
my skin and I did not like that at all
but when I went on to the other side and
I applied it with a sponge it applied so
beautifully I loved how it looked on my
skin because this foundation is a bit
more full coverage I would say it's like
a medium to full but you can totally
build this up and get a full coverage it
does look a little bit heavier on my
skin and I have very dry skin maybe if
you have oily skin you might like the
way this applies with a brush but for me
personally a Beauty Blender is the way
to go a damp sponge this one is actually
brand new from Beauty Blender I just
bought this on Sephora it's their new
sapphire color how cool it color I love
it it's so cute I didn't bleed in my
sink you know like the pink one bleeds
everywhere I don't want the pink one
anymore this one was good for a primer
I'm using my Smashbox photo finish
primer Iser I can't
wait for colour-pop to release ain't no
filter primer is that what they're gonna
do that's what I think they're gonna do
it'll be cool if they can do like two
different ones like like one for your
poor isn't one for like oily skin you
know and then make a no filter like
radiance one that would be cool okay so
I'm gonna shake up light 65 and then
pump it onto the back of my hand and
what I was gonna tell you about this
pump that I don't love it's a little bit
stiff so you can't really customize your
pump Oh what is it this one I can I was
using the shade light 50 yesterday and I
felt like every time I tried to watch
let me see if it does it yeah you see
did you say that every time I try to
squeeze down like it shoots it out and
it doesn't let me control the size of my
squirts I don't know maybe it's just
this one that's not happening with light
65 so I don't like to dot this all over
my face I like to work in sections so
put it on the back of my hand and then
go in little by little and if you feel
like you need to add more coverage you
can do that because you can add layers
and it looks fine
it is really really good coverage but
you can see my skin peeking through just
a little bit so I don't think it's too
full I would say it's less coverage than
the shuwei foundation it's less full
coverage than the Urban Decay all
nighter but it has more coverage than a
lot of foundations in my collection okay
so normally I would be totally okay with
that that's like as much coverage as I
need but I am just gonna apply a little
bit onto my cheeks just to build up the
coverage a bit here so you can see which
by the way I don't know the difference
between this and the concealer like
formula wise I will say that I've used
that concealer as foundation time and
time again even in the video where I'm
reviewing all the concealers I'm wearing
the concealer as foundation and I think
it looks great
and I would say this kind of gives me a
very similar finish but it's a little
bit more natural the wearing the
concealer as a foundation is a little
bit more matte but I feel like it gives
me the same type of live you know okay
so and I'm gonna zoom you guys in so you
can see how this foundation looks on my
skin I think it did about two pumps and
I don't know if you guys can tell but it
does look a little dewy on my skin and
this does claim to have a natural matte
finish but in my opinion at least with
the Beauty Blender it gives you more of
a natural satin finish this foundation
is tacky by the way it's not the type of
foundation that you're gonna play and
then it's just gonna dry down and you're
not gonna need to set it well I mean if
you have dry skin you're not gonna need
to set this unless you hate that tacky
feeling I really don't mind sometimes I
hate it sometimes I don't care it
depends how I wake up but just keep that
in mind like for example my forehead it
feels pretty good it doesn't feel tacky
but my cheeks do a bit and that's
probably because I added a second layer
to my cheeks oh my gosh another thing I
noticed okay so when I was wearing these
foundations in the past two days that's
why I'm doing this video today because I
am doing a wear test in today's video
I'm gonna show you what this foundation
looks like at the end of the night but
the last two days that I wore this by
the way I'm going in now with my color
pop no filter concealer this concealer
as you would imagine pairs so well with
this foundation it's like they were made
for each other I'm going on with a shade
light 20 and just blending the end is
blends right into this
nation it's like Oh sinks right in they
were made they were made for each other
oh no possible for the world look this
way forever if you know that song we're
best friends
I completely forgot what I was saying
before I started putting on concealer so
oh I remember the last two days that I
was wearing this foundation I was only
wearing them for like a couple of hours
and then I took my makeup off to try out
some other different stuff so I wasn't
wearing it throughout the entire day I
don't know how this foundation wears
throughout the day and it claims to be
long wearing but I don't really know cuz
I only wore I won't yesterday for about
three hours and then award the day
before if I went out to dinner and then
I took it off when I came back so I'm
really excited to see how it actually
wears throughout the day today because I
might look like a hot mess at the end of
the night no so now I'm just gonna go
ahead and jump into some no filter
powder I'm gonna be taking the loose
translucent setting powder today I used
this yesterday with the color pop
concealer and then I used it the day
before with a different concealer and I
really really liked it the banana shade
is too deep for my skin tone I tried to
set my under eyes with this yesterday
and it made my under eyes like mustard
yellow I'm just gonna take this tapered
highlighter brush it's from Julius place
and I'm gonna pick some up onto the
brush but then I'm going to tap it off
on the cap
this makes your under-eyes look so
smooth and airbrushed with as dry as my
skin is this does not make my undereyes
look dry at all as you can see that
really didn't mattify my undereyes but
it doesn't make it look too dry or
chalky which I really really like I was
noticing yesterday when I was wearing
this foundation they set it down and
everything I noticed that my smile lines
took a lot longer to peek through and I
didn't notice them to look so crazy
throughout the day usually no matter
what foundation I put on my face it
sinks right into the lines and look at
this look at this I've been wearing it
this whole time this whole video and
usually by now like you would see some
significant lines and look at this like
I see it creeping up I see a creeping up
but it's trying to resist it and I can
appreciate that okay so for the sake of
this video for the sake of reviewing the
no filter sheer pressed powder I am
gonna set half of my face with the
powder and then I'm not gonna set the
other side of my face because some
people set the foundation some people
don't
I'm gonna take the shade medium I
haven't used medium before I used light
previously and I felt like it was a
little too white for me I'm just gonna
take the shade medium on this giant
fluffy it cosmetics brush and I'm gonna
dust that off even though this powder
doesn't really have any pickup or
fallout I'm just gonna take a little bit
of that and just set my foundation down
on this side
I like that you can dig your brush into
the pan but you don't pick up too much
product and you don't apply too much
powder on your face I don't know I
really enjoyed it yesterday for setting
my foundation so I just zoomed you in so
you can see my face before I go in with
bronzer blush all that good stuff this
is the side with the powder I'm gonna
apply the rest of my face makeup but I
thought I would continue on the theme
and just do like a full face of color
pop pretty much so I'll be right back
okay so I just finished putting on the
rest of my makeup I felt like the
bronzer and everything just applied
smoother on this side of my face because
I set it with the sheer pressed powder
so far so good I will say the only thing
I don't like about this foundation that
I notice is around my nose it does look
a little bit dry I'm still very
surprised that my smile lines aren't
deeper I feel like by now the foundation
would have been suck into that line but
besides the area around my nose I say
that's the only area of complaint and
just maybe a little bit in between my
eyebrows those two are my trouble areas
though basically at this point this is
where I would apply my setting spray
like no matter what foundation I'm
wearing I always end it with setting
spray but for the sake of this video I'm
not gonna apply some today but if you
have dry skin setting this foundation
makes it look so beautiful like oh it
just it's the finishing touch but yeah
I'm really excited to have a new
affordable foundation I'm gonna come
back at the end of the night and we will
see how this wore throughout the day hey
guys so it is officially 1006 p.m. and
I've had my foundation on for about
eight hours now I was waiting for 10
p.m. because I actually really want to
take a shower I went to sleep really
late last night and then I woke up
really early today so I'm just like
extra sleepy but this is what my face
looks like after eight hours there are a
couple things I will say I like all of
my foundation has gone from right here
this foundation just phase from my chin
really easily I don't know why I think
the majority of the foundation around my
mouth has disappeared which is probably
why my smile lines look fabulous after
so many hours my smile lines would
usually look absolutely horrid if I
don't blend them in throughout the day
which I haven't all day today and they
look pretty freakin good I mean besides
the fact that a lot of the foundation
has rubbed off but I mean usually it
would look worse I look a little bit
dewy especially here around my nose and
then between my forehead here which I
never get oily there I wouldn't even say
it's oily because when I touch my face
I'm not oily at all I'm very dry but I
look a little radiant I'm afraid if you
have oily skin you might notice your oil
is really peak through at the end of the
day I
not knowing because I don't have a skin
I hate not telling you I don't know how
you would like it if you have a
different skin type than me but I really
like how this looks right now I mean it
looks pretty good after eight hours so
except for right here it definitely have
to play around with the face powder a
little bit more and use it with
different foundations and see how I feel
but the under eye powder I really really
really like the loose translucent one
it's so nice it makes your under eyes
look so smooth and it doesn't make it
look too heavy the foundation I do
really like so far I'm gonna continue to
use them and play around with it and of
course I know this hasn't launched yet
but I'm sure it will soon and I hope
this video at least helped you make a
decision whether or not you want it to
pick it up hey guys okay so ignore the
weird pause on my face but I just
quickly wanted to come on here and tell
you it's been like two days since I
filmed this video I am editing this
video on Thursday night and I just
wanted to tell you guys I've worn this
two times after filming this video and
if I can rate this like if I can if I
had to give it a grade I would give it a
b-minus I don't want to give it a C
because it's $12 it's cruelty free and
there's a bunch of shades I feel like it
has a lot of good things that was really
sink into my fine lines it lasts pretty
decent around the eye like on the rest
of my face but I'm not giving it an a
because it does fade around my mouth
pretty easily like it feeds off of my
chin so so fast and I don't know why
it's very strange like on the rest of my
face I love it but I don't love it
around the mouth I love that's just my
skin type or something maybe who knows I
just want to give you a quick little
update okay alright that completes video
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
