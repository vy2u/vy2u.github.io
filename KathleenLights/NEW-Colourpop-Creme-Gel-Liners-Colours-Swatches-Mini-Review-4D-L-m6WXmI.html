a quick impromptu last minute video you
guys know that I feel like I say this in
every single video so I'm really sorry
but I'm in the process of moving and I
have taken a little corner so that I can
film videos for you guys in the meantime
I'm only posting two videos a week this
month but if you've noticed I'm trying
to put like a current video on
Wednesdays so I'm trying to at least
film once a week current videos that
aren't pre-recorded so that is what we
were doing today today is a current
video it's not pre-recorded I had lights
on my wall if you guys saw that last
week but they kept falling off so I just
took them down I'm gonna put like a
frame here instead so today's video is
going to be a swatch video on these new
bad boys right here I will go into
details right now basically this kind of
shocked everyone but color pop came out
with um cream gel eyeliners like cream
pop gel eyeliners and matching eyeliner
pencils so each color has a matching
pencil so each gel liner has a matching
pencil like I said ten times they came
out with 24 of them so those were like
the more neutral shades and these are
the colorful ones 24 new pencil liners
and gel pot liners which was crazy I had
no idea that they were even coming out
with this and I wasn't gonna film this
video but it was so so highly requested
when I posted this picture yesterday but
I had to film it this video is going to
be a swatch video so I'm going to show
you all the swatches first and then at
the end of this video I will give you
kind of like a review on what I think
about them actually it's more like a
first impression because today was the
first time that I used one of them I
have the gel liner on the top you know
where gel liner usually goes and then I
have the pencil in like in a different
color in my waterline right here but
really quickly I do want to say that I
have no idea when these were
least I do want to say that they release
soon I emailed colour-pop asking them
like hey when do these release but I
haven't gotten an answer yet so come
back to this video in like a week and
check the description box I will have
information updated in the description
box like pertaining when they will go on
sale like when they will start selling
these I also don't know the price of
this I know I'm not prepared but it was
so requested to do this video so I
wanted to get it up I have no idea how
much they are going to cost but
definitely I'm sure they will be
inexpensive because everything from
colour-pop is so cheap so again come
back in a week and I will have the price
updated down below okay so I'm going to
start off with the swatches the big
swatch is the pot and the skinny little
swatch is the pencil there were two
swatches for some reason that got
deleted so there is I'm missing like two
clips of footage of different liners so
I apologize but that first one was exit
and it was a white and punch is a really
vibrant yellow while this one is called
puppy and it's a beautiful orange this
one is called boots and it's a hot pink
and this is crybaby this one is actually
really unique it's like a lavender
purple I really love it this one is
called piggy bank and you do have to do
a few layers with this one but it is
still very pigmented this one might be
one of my favorites it's bee sting and
ten
this one is such a pretty periwinkle and
it is called cramps I love it this is a
beautiful mint green and the shade Zulu
this is like the perfect Saint Patty's
Day cream in the shade maybe and this
one right here is called work out when
my favorites a really deep forest green
this one is similar but it's a teal
instead of a green like a deep teal this
is ztl a more of like a purpley based
blue really pretty this one is perfect
for fall it's called no shame it's like
a purple with a little bit of red and
this one invest Oh is a really pretty
deep burgundy shade this one is stomper
anting light brown
and this one is overboard
such an amazing metallic sheen Showtime
is one of my favorite ones out of the
metallic ones it's like a copper little
penny this one is dirty talk it's a
really intense gold and then this one is
an intense silver in the shape kicker
the one the other swatch that got
deleted was another metallic shade like
a nice a bronze this one is timber in
this really dark dark gray and then the
classic dark matte black in swerve so as
you saw they're all very very very
pigmented the pigmentation is on point
with these but just to give you an
overall mini review on the product let
me show you the one I have on my eyelid
right now is this one right here and
it's called
work out if you saw it in the swatches
this one is the like black blackened for
screen it's a four screen but it's very
very dark which I really like because it
looks black but it's not like you can
definitely tell next to a black eyeliner
that it is a forest like a dark green
and I have the workout eyeliner pencil
liner like on my tight line on the top
so I combined these two and then on my
waterline I wanted a like pop of more of
a bright green so I used the pencil
liner in maybe on my waterline so that
is everything I have on my eyes I do
have a little bit of a powder eyeshadow
in the crease and a little bit
underneath this eyeliner but this is
basically just the combination I have on
my eyes and mascara now I do think these
are very good especially for the price
even though I don't know the price I
know they're going to be very affordable
but I do have a little bit of a
complaint with them you guys know I'm
very very honest and even though
I work with color pop and I love color
pop to death I got I got to tell you my
opinion now this is only my opinion on
the green one because I only have used
one of them so this is just the first
impressions my opinion can totally
change in two weeks or Sookie Joe I want
to talk about the gel pots first they
are really good very pigmented at least
this one is very good very pigmented but
it is a little bit dry that's the only
thing I will say about it I don't know
if it's just this color but it is a
little bit dry on my eyelids now with
that being said I have extremely dry
skin I have extremely dry eyelids I have
to moisturize my eyelids I didn't today
I didn't put on moisturizer this morning
because I'm weird but I have extremely
dry eyelids like you know how some
people have really oily eyelids and
things crease on them that rarely
happens to me because my skin is so dry
so for me these are a little bit dry if
you have really oily eyelids you might
not even notice that at all
but on someone with dry eyelids like I
found it just a little bit dry it did
kind of tug a little bit but that is
such a minor complaint honestly I do
think they're worth it anyway because
they are so pigmented and maybe the fact
that they are a little bit dry means
that they'll last longer I'm gonna
update you in the description box how it
lasted throughout the day because I'm
going to wear this makeup for the entire
day and I did my makeup around 3 hours
ago and I mean it's still going strong
but it's only been three hours now I
don't know how all of them work but this
one in work out that is the only little
complaint I have but it's very pigmented
and I do really like it I love the color
selection I think you should give these
a try these shimmery ones like the ones
with like a more metallic finish are so
so creamy and I have a feeling like oh
my god it's just like butter when I put
it on my skin now with that being said
I'm going to talk about the pencil
liners these are freaking amazing
amazing
amazing I'm obsessed I do like these
more than the gels this is the one that
I have on my waterline and I've had it
on my waterline for three hours and it
hasn't gone anywhere it's still very
pigmented it it's now I'm not somebody
that has super run a runner reef that's
not a word I'm not someone who has
really runny eyes like very watery eyes
I usually don't have a problem with that
but sometimes eyeliner just doesn't stay
on my waterline not that it gets watery
and like smudges but it just disappears
or it doesn't paint on the waterline
does that make sense like sometimes I'm
putting on eyeliner and I feel like
nothing is transferring on to my
waterline I don't have that problem with
these they're so pigmented and they go
so amazing on the waterline and my
favorite part is that they are
retractable you can see they're
retractable I love that because I don't
need to bother with a sharpener and at
the end of the day retractable eyeliners
aren't as harsh as wooden ones sometimes
you'd be poking your eye with a wooden
eyeliner you know what I mean like it's
happened to me before where I like poked
my eye in it
I just hate wooden eyeliners I love that
it's retractable
very creamy very easy to use so
pigmented so blendable so fantastic I'm
obsessed with the freakin these so
overall I am very very very happy with
it
the only gripe I had was that the gel
pots are just a hair dry but again I've
only used one of them so I feel like I'm
jumping to conclusions but that was just
my initial first impression I think you
definitely should check these out of
course they don't come in these
packaging like in this packaging when
you buy them I mean I don't know if
they're gonna sell them like this but
this is like they're PR packaging um
Kylie pop is really stepping it up and I
think that you're just getting bigger
and bigger and better and better
so yeah that completes this video I know
was a kind of like short and simple and
so you know I'm not in my house and I'm
not in my video room and most of my
makeup is packed away I'm very limited
to the videos that I can film I did take
out a lot of like makeup recently so
that
can try to film tutorials while I'm here
so yeah that completes this video I hope
you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
