be all about the new color pop press
eyeshadows I have them all right here in
my NARS palette because I didn't have
anywhere to put them in because they
come as singles in the little pan so I
ordered an extra large Z palette off of
Amazon and I'm waiting for that to come
in the mail but for now they're in this
palette but ever since these launched a
couple of days ago I've gotten so many
requests to sit down and talk to you
guys about them what I think about them
review them and give you guys swatches
as well so if you guys didn't know color
pop is kind of originally known for
their super shock shadows they're also
single eyeshadows but they look like
this and they're a completely different
these have like a moosie wet texture
they're incredibly pigmented and just
like out-of-this-world insane very
unique but they actually release press
eyeshadows that you could just pop into
a Z palette they have that powder
formula that most eyeshadows have even
though I love a lot of they're super
shock shadows in the matte finish I feel
like they only work well with certain
brushes like they have to be synthetic
and some people might say it's a little
bit harder to work with but these masks
work with any brush they're a little bit
easier to use so these are the colors
right here these are the shadows we just
recently launched I'm sure they're going
to be launching like hundreds more as
the months start rolling on because
color pop is known for just spitting out
collections like this but I actually
really love the colors I think they're
so beautiful I'm actually going to go
through each eye shadow with you I'm
going to try to run through them really
quickly I'm going to tell you my sauce
and then I am going to swatch them right
here for you on my hand so you can see
how they apply like with my finger but I
do have close-up swatches just so you
can get a better look so before I get
into the swatches I just want to quickly
give you kind of like a mini review
there is actually one color in here that
I don't really like and it's this one
called piece of cake which I was
actually really excited for but I'll get
into why I don't really love it when we
get to that shade but besides that
actually love all of these I think
they're amazing they blend really well
they do have some fallout they remind me
a lot of the anasazi eyeshadows in the
sense that when you put your brush in
you do get some powder kick up but it is
because they are just so softly you get
a little bit of kick up I don't really
mind that but if you're someone who just
hate pick up on the brush you might not
like these but I did do my entire face
today before I did my eye makeup and I
didn't
notice any fallout on my face it was
just the eyeshadows itself to head a
little bit fall out when I put my brush
hands but all you need to do to avoid
that is just tap off the brush and then
go in and you're fine you won't have
much fallout these are only five dollars
each very similar to makeup geek so very
very affordable and they are similar to
make a peak in the sense that they blend
really well they're very pigmented I
really really like these I just I love
color pop you guys know one of my
favorite brands they just do makeup so
well at such an affordable price which I
mean the only connect we're really so
let's get into Z colors so the first one
is called Firefly and I'm going to
quickly apologize for the way I'm going
to describe these shades I feel like
there's people on the internet that are
like using it's a commuter dusty roads
with a little bit of nation in Si bit of
that like people can describe shades so
perfectly I'm just going to tell you
what I see this is like a light creamy
neutral shade perfect to highlight the
brow bone perfect if you are very very
fair to set your eye primer down a
really great chain I feel like it's a
necessity and in I have a collection
because it pairs really well with cool
tone looks and with warm tone looks so
this one is very creamy when you put
your finger in it it's like creamy so
pigmented and you can't even see that
because it's almost my skin color can
you see it a little bit the next one is
very similar only it has more of a warm
undertone this one is called hear me out
I'm actually wearing this underneath my
brow bone to highlight today and I feel
like it just lifts the brow so much it's
very pigmented then we just watch it
right here see this one is a little bit
brighter you can kind of see this one a
little bit more against my skin tone
again really creamy like when I put my
finger in this it feels so buttery so so
buttery this next one is also a matte
shade but it has a really strong yellow
undertone
this one's called locked and loaded also
really great for underneath the brow
bone if you have maybe a deeper skin
tone or if you're very very very fair
like porcelain this could probably be a
nice yellowish transition shade so it's
that one right there I just want to
point something out you will notice if
you like to watch them too hard or if
you dig into that a little bit too hard
they look a little chunky when you
swatch them but it's because they are so
soft like I said and they do have that
kick up so don't let that
turn you off it's not going to apply
chunky or weird and patchy on the eye
and very creamy a lot of the times some
maps can be chalky
these are not chalky this next one is a
really pretty shimmery pink it's very
light perfect for the inner corners or
your brow bone if you're into a shimmery
12 on purpose for all over the lid these
are the kind of shades that you can just
use anywhere this is really pretty light
for a halo eye right in the center this
one is called liar liar' let me swatch
it for you it has a really pretty
reflection to it this next one is called
let me explain I love this eyeshadow I'm
actually wearing it as a highlight on my
face today because I looked at it and I
was like you would be a gorgeous
highlight because they have a slight
golden undertone but it's more champagne
and I love colors like this on my face
this is also the color I have in my
inner corners right now so intensely
pigmented but it gives you a beautiful
Sheen see what I mean he's so beautiful
socially selective so pretty the shimmer
shade you feel soft just like the matte
one they don't have that like wet foil
feeling that a lot of shimmery
eyeshadows do for example the shimmery
shades from Make Up For Ever almost feel
wet when you touch them or like makeup
geek foiled eyeshadows they don't have
the feeling of a foiled eyeshadow they
feel more powdery more like a regular
eyeshadow but still really good payoff
this next I thought I was calls you know
the drill it's a really pretty champagne
shade but it has kind of like a bronzy
undertone this one and let me explain is
much lighter this one is a little bronze
e'er I have this eyeshadow on my lid
today it's the only shimmer shadow on my
lid and I love it give a nice little
shimmery pop going to swatch it for you
you know the drill uh-huh right there
really beautiful bronzy color so so
pretty for everyday this next one is my
new favorite transition shade it reminds
me so much of Mac soft brown it's the
perfect transition shade for me it's
called wake up call and wearing this in
my crease today and it gives you the
most pretty pinky Brown well pinky tan I
don't know a little bit of pink in there
it's such a beautiful matte shade really
really creamy love this shaded so so
magical look at that magical I love it
so much this one is another
beautiful matte transition shade is
called bel-air it's a little bit less
pinky than wake up cause you can see
it's a little bit more Brown perfect for
any eye color you're going to throw on
your lids like this works with cool tone
books and warm tone looks it's like the
perfect transition shade you can zoom in
there such a beautiful color I love it
okay next up is another favorite of mine
you need this color it's so beautiful
it's called
note to self I'm also wearing this in my
crease I have a bunch going on in my
crease right now but I love this it
reminds me a lot of Mac's saddle and
when I used to wear matte shadows all
the time saddle was like my baby I wore
it all the time with Amber life it was
the perfect little combination and this
one reminds me so much a saddle look at
that that is beautiful it has like the
perfect warm terracotta undertone but
it's still a brown this one is another
beautiful eye shadow it's called save it
for later if you're into very warm gold
eye shadows this one will be your best
friend it does remind me a lot of Mac
amber life now that I'm thinking about
it but less orange a little bit less
orange starting all over the lid
actually wore this one all over my lid
yesterday when I was just playing around
with these eyeshadows I love a gold that
pulls more orange II it's like my thing
okay so this next eyes shadow might be
my favorite out of all of them well no I
have a bunch of favorite okay but this
one is beautiful this one is called
paper tiger it's the perfect mustardy
yellow brown I got a lot of questions
about how this one compared to the
mustardy shade in my morphe palette and
they're very very different see this is
the mustard a right there and this one
is way more yellow and a little bit
lighter both very beautiful I love this
shade it is stunning in the crease I
have it in my crease right now a really
great way to use eyeshadow is if you're
completely done with your eye look but
you want some warmth and you want
something extra in your look just get a
big fluffy brush and just a little bit
of this in your crease it's kind of like
what I did today and it just gives a
little bit of like yellowy warm eNOS to
the crease and I love it so this is the
color right there
such a pretty transition shade even if
you are very fair colors like this can
be a little scary this one is awesome
this one is called top notch this one
reminds me a lot of Mac's
rig cycle
brick sidewalk no what is that Mac eye
shadow it's not Mac red brick there's
another one I can't even think of the
name of the macro shuttle something with
a brick
I almost positive anyway it reminds me a
lot of makeup geeks Coco bear as well
it's that really pretty brown with that
red undertone Brown script Wow nothing
about a break okay
Mack Brown scripts it reminds me a lot
of that one really beautiful look at
that so pigmented stunning I'm sure you
have a bunch of colors in your
collection that already look like this
but it's another staple this one is
another favorite of mine I think it's so
unique I know I have to have colors in
my collection that looks like this but
it's so beautiful and I love how its
kind of duochrome this one is called
come and get it it's a really pretty
pinky purple but it does have that gold
shift to it stunning I've seen a bunch
of eyeshadows that look like this but
it's so it it's so beautiful look at
that I love it so much when it catches
the light the gold really comes out but
then it looks pink oh my gosh I love it
okay so this one is called popular
demand and it's really similar to the
top notch you can see this is top notch
right here top notch is a little bit
more Brown and this one has a little bit
more of like a purple undertone which I
feel like I don't have many eyeshadows
in my collection that look like this
this one is also very kidding me I'm
going to say that about all of them
because they're all lit agree this would
be so beautiful in the outer corners
just to give a little bit of depth to
the look I love colors like this it's
very rich
this one is called stay golden and I
love how it's not a gold eyeshadow and
it's called stay golden colors well
always those that they'll name like a
red lipstick periwinkle like they do
that all the time I think it's so funny
anyway stay golden is a really really
beautiful
pinky ready purple shade I have this
color on the outer corners of my lids
today that purple you red shade is this
and I fell in love with it today is the
first time I used it and I loved it this
one for some reason doesn't feel as
creamy as the other matte ones do still
very pigmented though but it doesn't
feel as like creamy as the other ones do
I don't know what it is thought it was
going to be a little bit patchy when I
started blending out but it's not it
goes on really smoothly and really
really pigmented you can see oh I love
this i shadow
definitely another one of my favorites
like if it had to pick the top 5 this
one would totally be in my top 5 I love
it
gives me honest hacia Modern Renaissance
vibes yeah I love this shade this next
one is called making moves and I also
have this on my eyes today somewhere
deep down in there
this one actually mixes really well with
this I gets a really pretty combination
to put on the eyes this one also doesn't
feel as creamy as a lot of them but it's
still extremely pigmented I mean look at
that it's such a pretty coral red color
very nice for the summertime or the
spring I think this color is gorgeous
this next one is so beautiful another
favorite of mine I keep saying that in
part this one is called wait for it it's
a beautiful pinky peach I'm obsessed
with this one this in your crease is
like beautiful it gives like such a nice
twist to the look mouth color I would
typically wear in my crease but it looks
so nice in the crease and just to give a
little something I don't know I really
really like this one now we're stepping
into the more cooler tone category this
eyeshadow is called made to last and I
would highly recommend this one if you
are a cool toned eyeshadow where if you
love the Grays the blacks the Purple's
the smoky taupe so if you're into those
kind of shades you would really like
this because this is the perfect crease
shade for a purple look or for a gray
look it's so nice because it's not too
ashy it has almost like a slight purple
undertone it is beautiful it's like a
beautiful dusty mauve with a little bit
of great I love this color it looks so
nice against Purple's definitely a
transition shade staple okay so this
next one is called take the lead and
it's like a straight up Cement grey I
never wear grey eyeshadow is that weird
I feel like I'm never going to touch in
a shade but it's still a really good
eyeshadow feel very smooth very very
pigmented I just I never wear great not
a color I ever reach for like ever
no maybe I would I don't know I feel
like people just aren't really that
passionate about the color gray I feel
like I've never heard anybody be like
yes my favorite color is gray I've never
heard that I've heard a block I've heard
white even but never great okay so next
up is an eyeshadow that I didn't think I
was going to love as much as I do this
one is called cloud nine and I'm wearing
this like I'll me very outer corners
just a little bit of this because I
thought it needed a little bit more
smokiness to it this is a really
beautiful deep dark matte brown with a
purple undertone it's not like a brown
but it looks so beautiful on the eyes
think I was going to love it so much
it's like a really amazing alternative
to black look at that it's so rich and
so dark but it doesn't look too brown or
too purple or too black or whatever it's
like I love it I love it
this one is like the only lonely little
purple inventor collection like an
actual purple this one is called silver
lining and again not silver
oh cool about you're so cute I never
wear a purple eyeshadow like ever I mean
occasionally but it's never a color I go
to this one is really pretty but I have
to say it's not my favorite purple this
one is a little bit patchy when I swatch
it it doesn't give me as much color
payoff as I thought it would like can
you tell they're from the swatch I
thought it would be a little bit more
rich and it isn't so this one is
definitely like well for me I don't know
I do have to try this on my I haven't
put it on my eyes yet so I want to sing
here and tell you like oh no this one is
garbage because I haven't tried it on
the eyes but just watching it on my
hands like not my favorite I don't think
it's anything special this meklin is
awesome this is a really cool like slate
grey it almost looks like really
metallic in the pan it's called
goody-two-shoes this one feels like
extra metallic when you put your finger
in it I don't know what that means but
this one is very very pigmented it's
like a dark grey with an intense silver
sheen to it
I hardly wear eyeshadows like this but I
love them when I do wear them I think
they're so cool or like really cool
toned smokey eyes like this all over the
lid would be stunning actually did a
gunmetal look using the melt cosmetics
stack in gunmetal and they have a really
similar color to this it's a little bit
more like glittery but this one is very
very similar that one definitely has
like actual sparkle in it
which I feel like none of the other
shimmer shades have like sparkle they're
just like a sheen anyway so we have
three more left this one is a really
beautiful appeal it's called back feet
for some reason even though I don't wear
heels that much they're like my favorite
eyeshadows to look at and my favorite
eyeshadows to swatch there's something
about blue tle colors that I mean just
make me look at that
that is beautiful I never wear colors
like this but how freaking beautiful is
that I think this one was really nice a
smudged on the lower lash line I love it
and it does
a beautiful Sheen to it okay so this
next one is probably my least favorite
out of the entire collection and it's
called piece of cake and I'm really sad
about that because when I saw everyone
receiving their packages I was like oh
my gosh that's going to be my favorite
shade like I love how these two look
together like there's something about
these two shades I love the combination
but I don't know I feel like it could
have been more pigmented it was a little
bit less pigmented than I thought it was
going to be Ashleigh tried using this on
my eyes today I took a pencil brush and
I really tried to smudge it on my lower
lashline and I feel like none of the
blue is really showing up like at all I
just kind of looked muddy and a little
gray and I don't know why I let me show
you when it's watching and it is a
swatch so bad like okay look like it's
not so bad but do you see what I mean I
don't know I don't know if you can tell
maybe I'm just being mean to the shine
shadow I'm sorry it's just I expected a
little bit more and when I tried to
apply to my eyes I didn't like the look
it was giving me I don't really like
this eyeshadow I'm sorry but there's
something missing I don't know okay so
when I tried that blue eyeshadow on my
lower lashline I was like this isn't
working it looks a little great it looks
weird so then I pulled out this one it's
called lost-and-found and this one I
actually really like I have some of this
smudged underneath my lower lash line
today but you can't really tell because
I put on darker colors on top of it but
I guess because this one is a little bit
lighter
it just looks brighter and I don't know
I like this one a little bit more than
piece of cake
it's a really really beautiful baby blue
shade again another color it typically
wear but look how pigmented that is that
one is really pigmented really really
beautiful if I'm ever in the mood to
rock some baby blues I will definitely
go to this one okay guys so those are
all of their single shadows but they did
release to pallet and this is what they
look like
I took the sleeve off thinking that the
names were on this but the names are not
on this the names are only going sleep
this one is called high maintenance and
this retails for $18 don't mind my
writing I wrote down the names of the
eyeshadows because you know I throw away
the sleeve by mistake so like I said
this is their high maintenance quad but
you're technically saving $2 since each
shadow is five bucks so you get a little
bit of a deal on that you have the shade
Just In Time which is a really pretty
gold color blessed champagne II more
golden that one is really pretty this
one in highest rung is phenomenal I love
this eyeshadow it's like a really
beautiful roll of gold with a little bit
darker than a typical rose gold I don't
know it is stunning all over the lid
then you have the shade right here it's
called get out when I first saw it it
reminded me a lot of the shade stay
golden but stay golden is much brighter
it's a little bit more reddish II purple
and this one is a little bit more like
brown so really beautiful shade and then
the last one is called a Pew alert it's
another dark purple but it has like a
brown undertone it's like a brownie
purple really really stunning these four
colors paired so beautifully the only
thing I will say I have a little bit of
a con with these products here I just I
don't love this packaging all that much
I think it is a little bit bulky I mean
you get four eyeshadows but it's in like
this box I don't know I prefer something
a little bit more sleek don't have your
on the packaging is really cute like I
love the stars I love the whole concept
but I just prefer something that's a
little bit more compact nothing anybody
cares it's just my personal opinion but
I do love the fact that you could just
pop these right out and throw them in a
Z palette so you don't really need this
packaging and I still think it's worth
getting it even if you don't keep the
packaging because it's 18 dollars and
you save $2 on getting these four
eyeshadows anyway this one is really
nice and then this one is low-key I
believe that's the name of this quad you
get four really beautiful warm orange
eyeshadow this one is called take it
slow it's another light shimmery shade
but this one is much more like champagne
ease than the gold and the
high-maintenance quad I'm actually going
to swatch it next to the golden bhai
mean yeah they're like a thousand
percent different and then I'm going to
swatch two eyeshadows from their singles
okay so I just watched for eyeshadows
for you to see the difference this first
one is called let me explain and then
this one right next to it that looks
very similar is actually the champagne
shade in the low-key palette can tell on
camera but let me explain is lighter
this one and take it slow has a little
bit more of like a pinky undertone I'm
not so sure you can tell and then right
here these are totally differences the
golden one just in time from behind
maintenance quad and then this one is
that bronze
shade called you know the drill I just
wanted to compare these colors together
because they're all like light shimmery
shades just in case you guys are
wondering anyway like I was saying that
one was take it slow and then they have
this one it's a really pretty leg muted
orange but kind of like a true orange
but not so in-your-face that one is
called I owe you this one in running
late is a really pretty yellow almost
like a peachy dirty yellow really really
stunning completely different from paper
tiger as you can see paper tiger is much
more like mustardy that one is running
late and then you have like this really
pretty deep red color nothing like any
of their single eyeshadows it's a very
beautiful unique color so yeah these are
both really awesome so again that
completes this video let me know what
