you
you
yes
you
hey guys so today's video is an obvious
one but colour-pop came out with a brand
new lip product and I knew that I had to
do this video for you guys it was
already very requested on my Instagram
they have released ultra satin lips
which if you're familiar with color pop
they have something very similar in this
exact packaging and they are called
their ultra matte lips which are
essentially liquid lipsticks and I'm
gonna say that I think that these are
even I think these would be considered
liquid lipsticks as well they are just a
completely different formula I'm going
to talk to you guys about the formula
this is by the way the review portion of
this video i swatched all the shades on
my lips at least all the shades that
they currently have you guys know color
pop throws out colors like every week
the shades that they currently have I
swatch them all as you saw right now so
these are not out yet they will be
available February 18th which is this
upcoming Thursday depending on when you
are watching this video but so I've been
playing with this formula for weeks now
colour-pop sent me kind of like a sample
of their upcoming satin lip and they
just wanted to get my thoughts on it and
I have been like so excited to tell you
guys about this for so long I am
completely in love with this product
this is probably one of my favorite
products colour-pop has I'm so
completely obsessed with this formula
just the just the whole product I love
everything about it so let me get into
detail so as the name suggests these are
their ultra satin lips and these are
really similar to liquid lipsticks in
the sense that they are literally a
liquid lipstick and the way that I can
describe this is if they're ultra matte
lip and a creamy lipstick had a baby
this would come out so think of their
regular lip e6 like a creamy version
like the cream finishes think of their
cream finishes and
they're ultra matte lips and combined
and you get this I don't I don't know
how to explain it I think it's magical
they do have a satin finish as the name
suggests so you're not getting a full
matte color and I feel like the longer
that it's on your mouth the matter it
gets like the more dried down the more
matte it gets but it never gets fully
matte and it never gets uncomfortable
I'm wearing this color right now this is
panda and as you can see there's a
little bit of shine to this lip product
but it's not like glossy you know it's
not glossy
these feel like nothing on my lips
another great thing about this product
is you can really press your lips
together throughout the entire day like
you can rub your lips together it
doesn't feel like you don't get any
tugging it doesn't feel dry a goggle
from Kat Von D is one of my favorite
liquid lipsticks of all time I think
it's freaking fabulous but if I do this
it transfers and like the bottom will
come on to the top if that do you get me
like does happen to you I don't know how
to me this is just always comfortable
all day and I got a lot of questions
like okay but what's the difference
between this and like a satin regular
lipstick not much but I do find that
these are extremely long wearing but
with that being said even though they
are long wearing they are not transfer
proof they will transfer to anything you
put your mouth on for example I'm
drinking this product right here as you
can see I'm about to take a step out
it's clean and the product transferred
onto this but it doesn't take the
product off with it so that makes sense
I don't know they are long wearing but
they do they transfer they smear if I go
like this with my mouth or like with my
hand it'll smear I've been wearing this
one for about 20 minutes now and you're
gonna see it comes off but color is
still going strong on my mouth so I will
say that this is definitely for those of
you who cannot deal with liquid
lipsticks that you're like no I can't
deal with the drying I can't I just
can't deal with it these ultra satin
lips are for you they aren't as long
wearing as their ultra mattes but they
still last a long time on my lips meet
personally their ultra mattes don't
transfer at all they're like a true
liquid matte lipstick they don't
transfer they last from the time you put
it on
to the time you go to sleep like these
are not as intense but they're they're
different they're just a satin finish I
really love this this is like my
favorite color product maybe I'm just
the only one that feels this strongly
about them maybe not everybody feels the
same way but I think that they have an
A+ winner with this they're so
affordable I'm pretty sure they're going
to be six dollars just like their ultra
matte lips I don't see why they would
change the price so six dollars for an
incredible product it's a steal so yeah
that completes the review of this video
really quickly I want to tell you guys
this is like a surprise Saturday video I
know really weird but anyway I'm not
changing of my background like for
example I'm still going to be filming in
front of my vanity I'm actually sitting
at my vanity right now facing my mirror
this is not going to be my permanent
background this is just one of the
backgrounds I have I will mostly just
use these for like lip swatch videos or
if I'm too lazy to set up my lights to
be completely honest with you this was a
spur of the moment video which is why I
quickly sat in front of my mirror and
filmed it so don't worry if you don't
like this background it's not like my
background you know so yes that can wait
this video um yep thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
