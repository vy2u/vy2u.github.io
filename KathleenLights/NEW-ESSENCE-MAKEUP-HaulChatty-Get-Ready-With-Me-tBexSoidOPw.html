a full face of first impressions but we
are actually going to be trying out a
bunch of essence makeup I'm actually
really really excited to film this video
because I just recently placed an order
on ulties website and I realized they
had a ton of new essence makeup things I
had never seen on also before I don't
know if they just like expanded things
on the Ulta website I just got really
excited I bought so many essence things
and I'm gonna be putting them on my face
and trying them out and giving you my
first impressions in today's video I am
so excited to do this because I love
essence that's one of my favorite
drugstore brands essence Catrice elf
what in wild those are like my favorite
brands of the drugstore because they're
the most affordable out of all of them I
feel and they're like really really good
alright so I'm just gonna go ahead and
get started I'm going to show you
everything I bought this is kind of like
a haul first impression to try to get
ready with me you know you know so I'm
not gonna do anything crazy on my Ives
just because the eyeshadows I purchased
from essence throw very natural-looking
eyeshadows so I'm just warning you guys
you're not gonna see anything like
intricate and crazy on my lids today but
I'm gonna start with primer this is the
fresh and fit awake primer it says it
has a healthy glow and a pore minimizing
effect it has vitamin complex and
cranberry water that sounds so amazing
doesn't it I'm gonna do my face makeup
first just because like I said I'm not
doing anything crazy on the eyes so I'm
very excited to rub some cranberry water
on my face
mmm this feels so nice oh I might have
applied too much there that's fine how
Betty did ice kinis okay so right off
the bat I don't love the scent it smells
so P it's not like soapy almost I'm not
crazy about the scent but it's not like
but it's not too bad but my skin feels
really really hydrated and it looks so
nice and dewy I'm gonna be trying out a
brand new foundation today so obviously
I can't really put this primer to the
test but I'm gonna be trying this out
with some of my other foundations like
in the upcoming weeks okay so for a
foundation I'm gonna take the essence
fresh and fit awake makeup
it says healthy glow it also has vitamin
complex and cranberry water and
picked up the darkest shade on Ulta they
have four shades for and this one is the
darkest I picked up 40 fresh Sun beige
and this looks like the undertone is
completely off for me but this is where
we're gonna go with they didn't really
have my shade at all like I said there's
only four shades and it's so sucky when
you're really excited to for our product
our really excited for a foundation and
then when you go and click all the
shades they don't have your shade
honestly with the whole Tarte thing like
what happened with the Tarte shaped amp
foundation that's been happening with
brands for a really long time I'm gonna
start applying my foundation while I
tell you how I feel but really quickly I
want to show you they also have a beauty
sponge that I think I'm gonna hate
because I don't like this shape I'm
gonna go away it really quick ooh look
how big it got got like massive anyway
like I was saying foundation shades have
been an issue with brands for a super
long long time but especially in the
drugstore but I feel like the reason the
Tarte thing blew up so much is because
first of all the Tarte shaped AIF
concealer is like America's no I can't
like Iran yours America's number one
concealer everybody loves that everybody
uses that so when they announced they
were coming out with a foundation the
internet went crazy and then when they
came out with 87 fair shades in like
three deep shades of course of course
people are gonna be upset naturally it
just doesn't make any sense whatsoever
but what I'm getting at is I feel like
this really is a lesson to other brands
I feel like what happened with Tarte is
definitely a lesson because other brands
saw the backlash they saw how people
felt and I hope that starts a change in
other brands obviously I wish it
wouldn't have happened this way but
hopefully it makes a difference and it
shows brands that you know what you need
to include a whole lot of shades so you
can target your entire audience like
essence having four shades is completely
ridiculous but brands really need to
realize your shade range is extremely
important okay so I like this sponge I
thought I was gonna hate it but you know
what it's applying my foundation really
nicely I would say the coverage of this
is like medium coverage but man I really
like how this makes my skin look I was
going in with very low expectations but
it looks very healthy and glowy and
awake you know even though I like the
sponge I don't think this would work for
underneath the eyes but I am gonna try
using it for a concealer today maybe
like on this side I'll squeeze it anyway
I don't have a new concealer so I'm just
gonna pop on my Catrice liquid
camouflage concealer in light beige can
you guys believe I'm almost completely
caught up to Supernatural I'm on episode
10 of season 13 I had to buy the
episodes on iTunes because I saw the
season finale of 12 and I was like wow I
couldn't wait for it to get back on
Netflix I couldn't so I had to get the
episodes on iTunes and you know what I
don't know how I feel about season 13
yet so I don't have a new essence powder
but I do have a new elf powder I haven't
used just yet I purchased this the other
day this is the beauty shield
antioxidant armored setting powder it
supposedly has antioxidants in it so
cute it says pour powder here well I'll
just dip right into this it's fine thank
so I'm gonna take my little Real
Techniques smokey blue brush I don't
know if it make my face brushes blue
something
it looks nice it looks nice it doesn't
look cakey underneath the eyes or
anything
made my skin look really really smooth
for bronzer I have the essence luminous
matte that's right
luminous matte bronzing powder this one
is the one for lighter skin I think they
have another one this is the shade
sunshine and this is very very light and
I first want to read the name I was like
a luminous Matlin why do they give such
dumb names but when I blend it on my
skin I kind of know what they mean the
word is satin that's what they were
looking for there the word is satin it
has like a nice Sheen to it but it's not
shimmery but it is like it's very light
so I am gonna go in with another bronzer
first gonna take my classic rheya
bronzer from thrive cosmetics and on my
little Sephora Pro Mini flawless powder
brush I'm just gonna Brown some of the
skin I would love to know what you guys
think about the whole Logan Paul
situation I know it's like old news
everyone's already been talking about it
but I don't know if it's because I'm not
like in middle school or another like
I'm not a teenager anymore that those
Paul Brothers I don't get it
like there are some other popular
youtubers I don't watch but I get it you
know like I get why they're popular
they're just not my thing
I don't I don't get the Paul brothers I
feel like they just scream a lot they
kind of give me a headache a little bit
I now I'm gonna take the luminous matte
bronzer and put some on my cheeks
hopefully it gives me a nice luminous
matte look I feel like that name would
confuse someone who doesn't really know
much about makeup like if I'm just
walking into Ulta and I'm looking around
and I want a matte bronzer I'm gonna
look at this and be like luminous man so
is it luminous or is it Matt you know
feel like it's a confusing name that's
all
okay so I'm not sure if that showed up
much on my skin I mean I do see a little
bit of a luminous mist to the bronzer so
yeah yeah it's very subtle I'm gonna
play around with it a little bit more
alright so for blush I have a little bit
of a system going on here essence has
these pallets that are empty they're
very similar to those Make Up For Ever
palettes where you buy the eyeshadows
and then you buy the palette and you
could put them in this is the my
must-haves palette and they have this
one and then they have an eighth pan one
which I accidentally bought the four pan
one I was trying to buy the eighth pan
because I bought eight pans of shadows
and blushes so they have these single
pans they look like this they look
bigger online but they're pretty small
and they have blushes I think they have
like a highlight and then they have
eyeshadows and then you can buy these
little palette and then pop them in
they're all the same size and I'm so
bummed I got the wrong palette but I am
gonna pop in all the blushes in here so
it's gonna be like my little blush
palette I got the shade rosy glow and
then you can just pop it right back out
it's so easy I wonder if the formula is
good because listen the essence set in
touch blushes are like the best formula
of these are so amazing so I wonder if
the quality on these blushes are gonna
be as good as these I don't think so
based on my swatches but I'm still gonna
give it a shot so I got that one then I
got coral dream strawberry smoothie this
one has a little bit of glitter in it I
didn't notice that when I bought it
online and then I got the bronzing
powder and this one's called hello
sunshine I'm just popping this into my
blush palette so boom this is my little
little essence blush palette and then I
have these four single shadows that come
in these little pans too I need to buy
another one of those palettes but for
blush I think I'm gonna be mixing
actually I'm gonna go in with the coral
one
I like it I really do there is like I
don't know if it's the bronzer but I
feel like this has a very soft Sheen to
it I don't know it might be the bronzer
though but I really like how that looks
all right so I also picked up this
highlighter palette that I wanted to
share with you guys this is the essence
made to Sparkle highlighting and
transforming prismatic palette and it's
one of those like holographic unicorny
type of highlighting palette which at
this point I'm pretty much over like
where I am right now I'm kind of over
this type of highlight but these looked
so pretty I thought they would be great
as eyeshadows and look at this one look
at this that is incredible
that is a beaut my god and then you know
what this one is beautiful as well this
is a classic like white gold highlight
and oh my gosh it is so pretty and I
would totally want to highlight with
this right now
like I want to I want to put this on my
face but I want to try this out and I
feel like this might be a little bit too
dark for me but I'm gonna give it a go
anyway this is the essence metal chrome
blush I'm gonna use the BH Cosmetics
it's my ray-ray brush it's a little bit
more subtle than I thought it was gonna
be but it's still very pretty on my skin
tone it is a little bit too dark like it
kind of looks a little muddy on my skin
but if you have a deeper skin tone than
me you might really really love this
okay so I'm gonna take a little bit of
this gold color and I'm gonna use my Mac
240s brush we're just gonna pop
okay so to melt all of that into my skin
I'm gonna be trying out the keep it
perfect makeup fixing spray let's see
how this mist goes hmm oh no that's
aggressive damn I gotta put my hand all
the way out here look goes back
I found it I was sitting on my
windowsill like on my window and I
looked everywhere for weeks I really
really loved how my skin looks right now
when I uh played this on top I feel like
it just melted everything right into my
skin and now my skin looks so so do we
in healthy and radiant but now I'm just
gonna do a little bit of something to
the eyes like I said I don't want this
video to be too long and I don't want to
do anything crazy on my eyes I'm just
hanging out at home so let's do a little
something oh by the way I'm gonna let
you guys know in my info box down below
how they swore throughout the how this
war throughout the day because I'm most
likely I'm gonna be wearing this all day
so I will leave you a little note in the
description box so like I said I got
four of their new my must-haves I shadow
z' and then I got three of their new
themed metals eyeshadow which by the way
these swatch incredibly beautiful but
anyway I'm literally just gonna put a
little something in my crease but a bit
but herbal I'm gonna take the shade miss
foxy Roxy and this is what I'm gonna put
pretty much everywhere I'm also gonna
put some of this shade on my lower lash
line except that these aren't magnetic
because I could just pop this in a Z
palette but starting okay so I'm gonna
take this shade go Goldy and I'm gonna
use this as my inner corner highlight
and my brow bone highlight on my Coastal
Scents brush I have had this brush since
the day I started to make channel
actually since before I started my
channel I placed a Coastal Scents order
and this is the only one I've kept
throughout the years I've kind of given
them away to like friends and family and
I just look at it and it gives me like
happy memories alright so this one is a
little bit dusty like when you swatch it
on your hand you'll notice it's a little
dusty not as smooth as the one I just
used but it still gives you a really
pretty machine so I'm gonna take a
little bit of this one called brownie
licious I'm just gonna add a little bit
of this
I like this eyeshadow it's very
pigmented very smooth not chalky or
anything and sometimes matte eyeshadows
from the drugstore can be a little rough
but this one is very smooth oh all
righty that it's time to test out some
mascara I actually bought two of them
not knowing which one I would like more
so I'm gonna do one on this side and one
on this side and we'll see which one's
better ooh actually before I go in whose
mascara I'm gonna take this the metals
eyeshadow I'm gonna take the shade
ballerina and glam I feel like my inner
corners aren't as bright as I want them
to be so I'm gonna take ballerina
Guerette and glam not Graham and I'm
gonna see if this makes a difference
Wow look at that shiny I freakin love
these I want to see if they have more
shades these little ones are awesome
okay so I'm gonna take the volume
stylist eighteen-hour lash extension
mascara with lengthening fibers and I'm
gonna put it on this eye this other one
is the instant volume boost mascara
okay so now that I've applied two coats
of each I think I like this mascara more
I can totally see those lengthening
fibers I feel like I made my lashes way
longer just gives me a little bit more
umph oh so I'm gonna apply some of this
I'm actually gonna leave my bottom
lashes without any mascara for some
reason I'm like failing that right now
okay we're pretty much done with the
entire face all that's left is my lip I
got a few lip products from peasants I
got four of their long lasting lip
liners I don't think these are new and
then I got two lipsticks that seemed
really unique and cool this is the ultra
last instinct color lipsticks and I got
ungrateful like ungrateful huh and then
I got this one this one's called Santa
Santa side clever clever but then I also
got two of their Matt Matt Matt
long-lasting lip glosses see they're
doing it again matte lip gloss
you're gonna confuse people essence I
got the shade simply be an icon and
beauty approved and then lastly for lips
I got these really cool unique lip
colors these are the metal shock lip
pinks and I got a blue and a green one
belladonna and poison ivy um what do I
do I really want to use this color on my
lips today so I'm gonna go in with my
lip liner I think I'm gonna use plum
cake yes
I'm gonna put on plum cake
these feel really really creamy okay so
I'm gonna go over it with sand aside I
don't know why I put on a purple lip
liner to go over it with this color but
I did I just I knew you guys were
expecting me to go in with this one
right fooled you
oh it's a little bit more sheer than I
thought it was gonna be hmm I don't know
I feel about that you know I went in or
the purple lip liner thinking I was just
gonna cover it but I didn't these are a
little bit sheer maybe I should have
swatched them first because this color
is really pretty it's just a purple
that's throwing you off um we're gonna
go in with this I'm gonna take the matte
matte matte gloss in the che simply be
an icon and I'm gonna pop this on my
lips whoo the smells like maple syrup
pancakes like no no like sugar cookies
and pancakes yes sugar cookies and
pancakes exactly
Wow this color is really really pretty
okay so I'm assuming this doesn't dry
down since it is a matte gloss I mean
you never know as the hours pass it
might start to get matte and a little
bit drier since is a long wearing
formula or it claims to be but of course
I will update you in the description box
