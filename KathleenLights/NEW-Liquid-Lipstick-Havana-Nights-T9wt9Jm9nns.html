a quick one because I have to be
somewhere in 35 minutes I wanted to
quickly make this video to talk about my
newest little friend if you guys follow
me on Instagram only on Instagram I
don't think I've even posted about it on
Twitter but if you guys follow me on
Instagram you have already seen my sneak
peek a little preview of this guy right
here this happened very very fast but
this is my newest collaboration with
Oprah cosmetics this is the new liquid
lipstick that I have created with them
for some reason it looks really really
dark on camera I look like a vampire I'm
wearing it right now
smells good really do like I said I'm
wearing it right now and it happened so
fast I didn't really have time to wear
it in videos and kind of like be really
sneaky about it I really wanted it to
just be a surprise like hey this is new
surprise mm that's what happened so I
just quickly wanted to make this video
for you guys just to tell you guys thank
you so much you guys always know that I
make videos talking about new products
if I'm collaborating with them I make a
whole video dedicated to it so today's
video is dedicated to this one this is I
forgot to tell you guys the name so this
in the shade Havana nights and I wanted
a name that kind of was similar to Miami
fever but still represented me in a way
and Havana is in Cuba and I'm Cuban so I
thought the name was perfectly fitting
and it's a really dark vampy Brown red
if that's how I can describe it you can
always follow me on Instagram and see me
wearing this I will be posting videos
with this lip color very very soon I'm
gonna do it get ready with me and I'm
gonna post other tutorials using this
lip product as the main focus so you
guys can see other ways to wear this
because a lot of people might not think
this is very wearable but with the
holiday season I think it's extremely
wearable like right now all I have on I
have tinted moisturizer on my face and
besides mascara and my eyebrows all I
have on is bronzer that's all I did
I didn't even put a shadow on my eyes I
just put on mascara a little bit of
bronzer and through
and I feel like I have a full face of
makeup me personally I really love bold
lip colors because you don't have to do
much with the rest of your makeup you
can go crazy and do like a really
dramatic look but you don't have to
which is what I like and I'm trying to
be a little bit more quiet and calm
since there are people in this home
right now
besides speaking of that I will be
posting an update video very soon like
another update video because I thought I
would be moved into my new house by now
but I'm not so I will be updating you
guys in a video about what's been going
on which is why I haven't been able to
post as much as I usually do I'm back to
posting twice a week until I move into
my new place because I thought I would
be done by now but I'm not about to
happier things so yes if you feel like I
have sprung this on you all of a sudden
I know I have it was like a surprise
release it is now available to purchase
right now I will have the link below if
you guys are interested in this lip
color but isn't being able to purchase
and I do have my 40% off discount
discount code which is crazy it's not
gonna last forever I've had that code
for a while but they did extend it for
this liquid lipstick but it's not going
to be around for a while it is a limited
coat and this is limited edition Miami
fever sold out like in a few days or
like a week or so and they did bring it
back one more time so you guys can
purchase it so they're both available
right now Havana nights and Miami fever
limited edition and the code is for a
limited time so take rounds of the code
because you save a big chunk of money
say 40% which is huge so I really really
love this and I thought the name was
fitting because it's like a dark night
even though nights or not red but I
wanted something that I felt was bold
enough for every single person like this
is extremely bold for someone with very
very fair skin but it is also a bold lip
color for someone who has very dark skin
so that's what I was going for and I
really hope you guys enjoy this again I
just want to say thank you thank you
thank you so much I have gotten so much
love and support over the past month
because you guys
now I've been like tweeting about it
I've been so stressed out with my move
and everything that's been going on and
you guys are so incredibly understanding
and always so nice to me on Twitter and
on Instagram and telling me not to
stress myself and to take my time I
really really appreciate that because
you guys see all the effort I put into
my channel I post three times a week
religiously and the fact that I can't do
that recently is driving me crazy ah I
know where earrings oh no oh man I gotta
put some on now I love that you guys see
how much I care about you guys so I feel
like you guys give me love in return
it's a very loving community and I just
love you guys thank you thank you thank
you so much because I say it every time
but without you guys things like this
would not be possible and I really
really hope you enjoy this lip color I
know it may not be for everyone for
those of you who are into nude lips this
is like a ballpark away from that but I
thought I wanted something that would be
really fun and festive for the holidays
so I hope you guys enjoy it I will have
all the links down below more
information down there a huge paragraph
telling you how much I love you all that
information will be in the description I
really had to make this video quick this
is the only time I had to film this
video since you know things have been
happening recently so much chaos okay
