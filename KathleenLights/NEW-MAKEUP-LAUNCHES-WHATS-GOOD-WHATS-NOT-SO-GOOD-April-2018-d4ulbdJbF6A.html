another one of my hits and misses kind
of videos where I talk about all new
products like newly released makeup that
I have been testing out and I'm here to
give you my opinion on them I feel like
I've tested out these products quite a
few times there's only one product that
I've only tested out twice and it's
what's on my eyes right now but besides
that I feel like I've given everything a
fair shot I did film like little clips
of me applying some of these things cuz
I know you guys wanted to see like the
application process on some of these
products so that is what I did not for
everything though cuz I got one face
also yes
I'm getting sick did you see that coming
I just recently got back from Canada and
from New York and I'm actually leaving
again in a couple days but I guess the
weather change and all of that it was
really cold in Canada I was the first
time had ever seen snow it was on the
ground and it was really hard but it was
the first time I had ever seen and I was
so excited I felt like I was in home
alone like the movie I don't know it was
amazing but I guess the weather change
is making me a little nasally a little
stuffy but anyway I took some of these
products with me when I was traveling
and it's all just really random just new
releases okay I have a lot of stuff so
I'm just gonna go so I have been testing
out a lot of eyeshadow palettes recently
first pallet I want to talk about is the
kickin w palette this is in
collaboration with Mario I don't get
k'kaw PR I think I did in the beginning
like when she first launched the brand
but I don't anymore and I really wanted
to test this eyeshadow palette out for
you guys so I purchased it and I have
been using it the formula is really good
everything is buttery and smooth and I
actually do like the color selection if
you're a neutrals girl you will really
like this you have so many amazing
neutral shades there's only one pop of
color this blue shade is all the rage
these days everybody's wearing it all
over their eyes and I love it I love
blue eyeshadow so I just find myself
enjoying this palette while I used it
but with that being said I think I have
other eyeshadow palettes in my
collection I get more uses out of its
$45 for ten shades so it's not terrible
at all actually when you break it down
it's not that bad but I don't know if
this is worth it to like immediately run
out and purchase it right away I think
you can definitely find these shades and
some other palettes you might have at
home if you don't have that many
palettes and you've been interested in
the I say go for it because it blends
well the formula is really nice
everything is nice and pigmented and I
also really like this packaging it's
just so sleek and just simple I love
simple sleek packaging so it's pretty
good I do like it I'm just not blown
away by it is all I'm saying
you know I'm saying this palette however
I mean it's a completely different type
of palette but it's amazing if you're
into colors if you're just completely
over the whole neutral trend like every
palette is so neutral I'm done I'm over
it it's the BH Cosmetics weekend
festival 20 color eyeshadow palette and
at first when I got this in PR I was
like oh you know this looks really cool
but I didn't think the colors were gonna
be as vibrant as they were I've used
this about four times and every time I
did a look with it I loved how it looked
I mean I did dabble in two other
palettes when I was using this but it's
such a nice companion palette like if
you do have a neutral palette and you
want a palette that's gonna give you a
lot of pops of color this is perfect
because it's affordable and it's so
pigmented and just so good I even spoke
about a BH Cosmetics palette
last time I made this kind of video I'm
like really impressed with BH Cosmetics
recently I don't know I didn't look the
other day where I used
candy and Trixie like on my lid this
really beautiful peachy shade like all
over my lid and it looked so nice let me
know if you want me to do like a full
peachy look cuz I have like the look in
mine I did it the other day and it
looked really pretty but I don't know if
it's just like too basic and like too
boring but it was such a pretty like
dewy spring look anyway if you've been
looking into this palette I say go for
it it's only 18 dollars that's a seal I
don't know if it's limited edition or
not I it kind of looks like it would be
but play good okay another major hit
this is the palette I was talking about
it's on my eyes right now I've only used
this twice but I know color pop so well
I know how their formulas work and I
knew I was gonna love this as much as I
do this is so freaking good this is
color pops newest collaboration they did
a palette with makeup Shayla I love the
packaging I it's so cool it's called the
perception palette and I love that you
get like an extra row of eyeshadows and
palate you also get a mirror which is
nice but the color selection is what I
love the most about this palette I think
Shayla did such a good job of bringing
you something that was wearable but also
colorful at the same time the shades I
mainly used our culture revenge played
out shade and ie
and it kind of created this really
pretty grungy dirty olive green smokey
eye you can get so many different looks
with this though you have some Purple's
some blues golds grays like you have a
lot of options in this palette which I
really really love and I also really
loved in her entire collection she came
out with three Lux lipsticks and two
loose powder highlighters these are a
little bit too deep for my skin tone but
you can also use these as like loose
eyeshadows as well you wet them a little
bit and they apply to lids like really
intensely and beautifully I think it
releases either this Friday coming up or
once or Wednesday when I post this I'm
not sure oh I forgot to mention these
okay this also was part of like the
whole festival collection with BH
Cosmetics whoops I'm like we're winding
here they came out with a palette some
brushes and they even came out with
these little highlights and I wanted to
talk about these really quick okay so
the brushes these feel amazing first of
all they're hot pink which is gorgeous
but the handles are soft touch so they
have like that rubberized feeling and I
love that like Norris packaging I live
for that I wash them before filming this
video because I wanted to see how they
would wash and they they wash perfectly
fine I didn't have any hair fall out or
anything like that but they are just a
little bit like stiff for me the actual
brushes like this one I don't really
like I tried to contour with this I
tried to apply blush with this I don't
really love this brush the only ones
that I really really liked it I think
are totally worth it is this one for
sure the number 1 brush this applies
bronzer so nicely and I also really like
these brushes as well
this is the only one that I was like and
I didn't really like that brush the
number-8 not my favorite but these three
I do like number 5 number 7 and number
10 I do find these to be so useful this
is such a skinny tiny little eyeliner
brush perfect for gel liner really great
eye brushes and just that a couple of
these we're like a little stiff and not
my favorite as for these eye lights my
first one
tried them out I thought they were gonna
be really similar to the Stila
magnificent metal kind of liquid shadows
or the supernovae shadows from
colour-pop but they are a little bit
different they're a little bit watery er
they're not as powerful I'm not I'm
trying to think of the word you know how
sometimes the colour-pop ones if you
layer them too much or if you apply too
much it can get a little bit hard I mean
they pack a punch but it can be a little
bit drying and stiff these are actually
not drying whatsoever they're very
comfortable on the eyelid if you don't
like supernova shadows you might really
like these the only thing is you have to
build these up because they're a little
bit softer you do have to apply like two
to three layers to get super full pink
like amazingness but it's it's doable
once you learn how to work with them a
little bit they are really gorgeous and
these three are my absolute favorites
yellow is called fresh the reddish
copper yellow is called galpão and this
blue purple is chill pill and they are
stunning you guys know I was always a
fan of the it cosmetics bye bye pores
pressed powder but then I discovered my
Kat Von D airbrush press bath I don't
know the name of it but it's an amazing
pressed powder that totally replaced my
bye-bye pores one I like it way more got
rid of my a cosmetics one but they
recently came out with a bye my pores
bronzer and I got really excited when I
saw this because I thought okay that
might be a great idea because you don't
really see pore diffusing bronzers on
the market I actually really really like
this bronzer I think it applies it so
smoothly and like flawlessly I guess
because it has that blurring technology
it really just applies like butter on
the skin and I like that has a little
bit of a sheen to it you guys know I
love my shiny type of bronzers but it's
not shimmery it just has kind of like a
natural glow to it this is one that I
really like I hate the whole packaging
on the pores things because you know
there's always like a little brush in
here that I never use but formula wise
this is really good I did contour my
face with something else and I'm gonna
show you in a second but I used mainly
this bronzer all over my face and I feel
like it gives the skin such a nice
forms like tan look perfect for
vacations this is the perfect summertime
bronzer and I like that it has that
blurring mist to it okay so I'm gonna go
a different direction here let's see
let's talk about lip gloss shimmery lip
gloss it's all the rage everybody's got
some glitter in they gloss it's just the
way it is oh I forgot to tell you
Shayla also came out with the lip gloss
it's just that I was sitting in my
shimmery lip gloss category that I
didn't notice but she has a lip gloss
part of the collection and this is such
a stunning lip gloss it's called a
neat-freak which makes a lot of sense
because she's a Virgo and virgos are
neat freaks fun little fact but it's
such a pretty gloss looks beautiful over
any type of nude any type of color
really and I feel like we've been seeing
that a lot with brands her lactic
actually just released these new lip
pearls I'm wearing this shade on top of
the Shayla lipstick in quickie this
one's called diamonds and the formula on
these it's so thin I don't know how to
explain it they don't feel very glossy
like obviously there's a gloss to them
like there's a glossiness to it but it's
a very thin gloss and the shimmers in
this are so thin I have three layers on
my lips right now and I feel the
greediness just a little bit but it's so
subtle that it doesn't bother me at all
I really can only tell if I try to look
for the grit you know these are not long
wearing by any means you will have to
reapply throughout the day it's
something you're gonna have to throw in
your purse and go but I love the
shimmery effect it gives your lips just
gives that juicy vibe to the lips
alright so I have two similar palettes
to talk about they're both face palettes
this is the calli contour shape bronze &amp;amp;
Glow palette from Smashbox and this is
the Urban Decay sin afterglow palette
this is a highlighter and blush palette
so this one from Urban Decay comes with
a mirror it's really nice packaging it
kind of like feels a little boxy but
it's not bulky so I'm okay with it it
has a mirror and then you have kind of
like a bronzer a few blushes and then
you get like two highlights here at the
bottom I really like this palette the
only thing is I always found myself
reaching for this one over this one I
think my favorite thing in this palette
are the highlighters they're very very
beautiful but I'm not crazy about the
blushes like they didn't really
long on my skin I don't know there was
something about the formula that just
didn't blow me away when it came to the
blushes and this one is also too deep
for me so I was really only using the
highlights I could totally see this
working for someone but for my
preference and just like for me I don't
see myself reaching for this palette
just to use the sin highlighter or a
spot light highlighter do you know what
I mean it's just not my favorite but is
a formula good yes if you see yourself
using these shades yes it's totally
worth it because you get so many
products in one so this is like a I
don't know product for me but the callee
contour has been something I have been
using non-stop I love the packaging on
this I think the packaging is a little
bit nicer than the Urban Decay one I
mean it just depends what you're into
but I like this type of packaging and I
like this mirror more mirrors are both
great on both palettes but for some
reason I just like this mirror more I
don't know if it's because it doesn't
have like the little box edges I'm
strange I also like that this goes back
all the way and you can grab your
palette and apply it to your face like
that actually I've never tried putting
this back on okay okay
literally use every single shade except
for this one this highlight shade is
just a little bit too deep for me but I
used it the other day as an eyeshadow
and I loved it I did like a one eye
shadow look and I loved it so I find
myself using every single shade I used
this one underneath the eyes I don't set
my concealer with it but I like to
brighten up my under eyes with this
color and when it comes to contouring I
do think this is a little bit too ashy
for me to contour and then this is just
a little too warm so I mix them both
together and I love the contour gives me
it is pretty intense you have to use a
light hand with this palette I also love
this blush but I love this blush it goes
with so many different looks it is
gorgeous and I also really love this
highlight when I first looked at that
highlight I was like I don't think I'm
gonna like this I have a feeling this is
gonna be dusty and like powdery and not
very highlight II at all but once you
apply it to the skin it does highlight
your face but in a very natural way
which I'm totally into I like that
natural highlighted look I love this
pre-canned palette I don't know what it
is about it I just love it so much okay
something I don't love it's not for me
it's not it might be for you but it's
not for me these are the 3d brow tones
from Bennett
they came out with so many different
shades they have copper rich purple deep
teal magenta deep blue they have so many
and I've tried out magenta and deep blue
and I just find them like I just don't
think it does enough I honestly feel
like you have to go apply like ten
layers of this to your eyebrows to even
get a magenta tone it's too subtle in my
opinion even this deep blue that you're
like wow it's so nice and deep blue it
just doesn't show up that blue on your
brows and to me it's just a little bit
pointless maybe it just didn't work for
my brows meeting eyebrows were just like
too dark but those 3d brows homes not my
thing
something that was my thing though was
this I freaking love this and I like the
mini one more because you guys know I do
not like benefit box blush packaging I
think these box blushes are so bulky
they just take up a lot of room but
benefit just recently released this gold
rush blush and they came out with a mini
as well so they sent me the big one in
PR with the mini and I ended up giving
away the big one to my friend and I kept
the mini one but I love it and you know
what I don't think the mini is too small
to look perfect perfect it perfectly
fits in there and I love this color when
you first get it there is a gold
overspray I don't know why companies do
that personally it's not my thing but it
was kind of like this gold shimmer that
was just laying on top and I grabbed my
brush and got rid of all that gold and
then I used it and it is beautiful this
is a beautiful freaking blush because it
is a peachy nude but there's like a
salmon undertone to it there is a little
bit of like a golden mist to it I
totally understand the name even without
that shimmer on top there's like a
golden salmon peach eNOS to it that is
so stunning I have to say out of all the
benefit boxed blushes I've tried and
I've tried all of them I'm gonna say
that Gold Rush is my favorite blush
they've released and the scent is
amazing it's the best scent they've ever
done on a blush all over their blushes
smell a certain way this is the best one
okay so we are almost done we have just
a few products I know this video was so
long forgive me but la girl released a
few luminous products too
that I'm all about and one that I'm
gonna pull my hair out because I despise
the packaging so much but I'll get into
it in a second so la girl came out with
this luminous glow skin illuminator and
I've been testing these out quite a bit
I've been using the gold one way more
than this one this is moonlight and this
is afterglow out of the - I like
afterglow a lot more there's another
shade but it was too deep for me so I
gave it to Amelia this is a very pretty
liquid illuminator if you want to mix it
with your foundations without being too
moisturizing I find that this one isn't
very hydrating like once you apply it to
the skin it kind of like sinks into the
skin and you don't really don't feel it
anymore and at first that threw me off
but I found that I love mixing it with
foundation like I have it today on my
face mixed in with my Born This Way
I don't know if it's because this is
like water and Dometic own just feel
like it mixes really well with your
foundation while still giving you that
Sheen and glow and it's not too shimmery
or too like it's not too much I don't
know I really like this there's so many
brands at the drugstore that are
creating these types of products and I
feel like if you have oily skin out of
all of them this one might be your
favorite because I didn't find that it
added too much tackiness or too much
glow to my foundation I did try it on
its own and I don't like it on its own
like on the top of the cheekbones like
I'm not feeling this product on its own
but mixed in I really like it this is
however they came out with the luminous
glow illuminating powders and I actually
I don't know if they came out with a
different shade I think this is the only
one that was sent to me so I don't know
this is in the shade 24 karat or 24k and
this is the biggest packaging fail I've
ever seen on a product like it watch
ready look this do you see that it's
closed and it is going everywhere
everywhere I don't know why I just did
that because I got literally gold all
over my phone I have gold all over my
coffee my shirt like it's closed right
why is it spilling when it's closed you
know honestly I can't even try I can't
even try to enjoy that product because
oh my gosh the bugs are gonna bark
postman just got here every time I've
tried to apply that to my face I get
that gold shimmer powder all over the
place all over my face all over my body
my clothes and is it just a packaging
fail for me because I honestly can't
imagine a brand coming up with this
packaging testing it out and being like
this is good we're good we're just gonna
go and prove it it's not messy at all it
doesn't get anywhere at all you know so
maybe it's just mine because this is the
messiest loose powder I've ever dealt
with like in terms of any type of loose
powder the messiest I have wiped my
table with a wipe too many times too
many times the milk makeup cush mascara
this just recently came out first of all
the packaging is really awesome it feels
like titanium like I don't know it feels
very very heavy packaging on point I
know people were freaking out about this
mascara but this krish mascara doesn't
have like marijuana in it it actually
has CBD oil which if you haven't done
your research on CBD oil it's actually
amazing for anxiety it does not get you
high by the way and CBD oil is actually
great not only for anxiety but like for
your skin supposedly they're like using
it a lot in makeup these days it's like
supposedly really great for your skin
and all that anyway there's CBD oil and
mascara which is supposed to be like
really good and conditioning for your
lashes and I didn't notice every time I
use this mascara I notice immediately
that it was just a softer mascara that I
was used to you know how certain
mascaras you apply them and your
eyelashes are literally crunchy like
they're hard that is not the case with
this mascara it leaves your lashes very
conditioned but it still gives them a
nice amount of length I wouldn't call
this a volumizing mascara I would say
it's more of like a separating
lengthening mascara personally for me I
like something a little bit more
volumizing something that's gonna look
like really black and thick that is what
I go for in a mascara but I still think
this would be a great mascara for like
day to day it is a high-end mascara so
I'm a little bit more critical on
high-end mess
because of the price I'm like I don't
know I don't know if it's worth it it
totally depends on you okay so I didn't
want to mention these I just recently
purchased them and I haven't really
heard anybody talk about them but they
are new I just got a Hmong Ulta a couple
weeks ago and it is the Neutrogena
essential cheek palette and essential
eye palette and I'm not a huge
Neutrogena fan for some reason
Neutrogena and Almain when it comes to
makeup those two brands I'm like but the
reason I purchased this is because it
was like a collaboration with Kerry
Washington and I little Kerry Washington
if you watch scandal Olivia Pope she's a
bad be feel bad be but I was a little
bit let down there isn't much pigment to
these products I don't know this is the
the cheek palette and the bronzer was
nice at the highlight was just really
chunky powdery didn't really highlight
anything and then this Bush was
obviously for my skin tone just a little
bit too intense but I found that the
formulas were so lackluster like the
pigmentation wasn't there for me I do
not like this a shadow palette feels
like it would be nice for mature eyes if
you're someone who is a little bit older
and you want a very neutral palette
because for some reason I feel like
these don't really accentuate texture
it's just they look very very similar
you're very limited to look that you're
gonna create I don't know I was just
like super let down by both of these
pilots I was like no it's Regina
