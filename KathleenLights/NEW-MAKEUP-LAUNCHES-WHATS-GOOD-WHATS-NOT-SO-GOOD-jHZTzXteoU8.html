something I haven't really done on my
channel before I mean I guess I've done
similar videos in the past but this is
something I kind of want to start doing
on my channel so basically I have been
testing out a lot of makeup I mean I'm
always constantly testing new makeup and
recently I had to put a bunch of makeup
in a box and I've been testing them out
for like the past two weeks I have like
a big table in front of me and I have a
bunch of makeup just laid out on top of
it and I'm just gonna give you my
opinion on all of these products I'm
gonna give you my little mini review
right here because I've used all of
these products enough to know like how I
feel about them officially and I thought
it would be so cool to do these every
once in a while because the makeup that
I include in my favorites videos every
month are just a small portion of makeup
that I'm trying out those are just the
best of the best the ones that stick
with me and the ones that I use the most
often throughout the month but I thought
it would be cool to just give you little
reviews on things I'm trying out new
makeup new launches new releases just
new stuff you know and my opinions on it
so that is what we are doing in today's
video let me know if you like this kind
of video leave me a comment down below
if you want me to do more of these and I
will I don't have a lot of drugstore
makeup in today's video I don't know why
I hadn't been testing out that many
drugstore products these past two weeks
I just have like literally a couple so
hopefully the next time I do this kind
of video if you're into it I'll have
more drugstore makeup but anyway I'm
gonna start off like how I would do my
makeup primer foundation concealers
powders and so on and so on and I've
been testing out two primary type of
products recently and they're both very
similar actually but the first one is
the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood flawless
filter actually bought this one and then
this one was sent to me by Charlotte
Tilbury so I have shade 2 &amp;amp; 3 it's
technically advertised as a complexion
booster this claims to have the
versatility of a primer
whatever that means the megawatt glow of
a highlighter and the perfecting
properties of a filter but it's just
supposed to illuminate the skin and give
you a soft focus effect kind of make
your pores and your lines appear
smoother because your face like just
looks more illuminated and it says you
can wear this alone or under
nation I personally don't know if I
would wear it alone
I love the packaging on this it's so
luxurious and beautiful it comes in a
glass bottle and it also has a doe foot
applicator which makes it so easy to
apply instantly gives me a super super
radiant effect I honestly would only
recommend this if you really want that
glow because this is gonna shine through
your foundation and it's just gonna give
you a super illuminated look but I think
it is rather pretty put on my regular
primer and then I will just take this
draw a couple of lines here a couple
lines here someone might forward and on
my chin just where I want a little bit
of glow just trying to do and I think it
does the job and another product that is
very similar and I'm actually enjoying a
little bit more than the Charlotte
Tilbury one this is the Vita Liberata
Beauty blur skin tone optimizer it says
it's an HD primer and skin finish I just
recently purchased this off of the Ulta
website I'm not sure if this is just an
Ulta exclusive but I cannot find this on
Sephora so this is kind of a similar
product to the Charlotte Tilbury stuff
they just don't have as many shades
there's only three shades of this guy
but I have the shade latte light this
claims to be kind of like a skin filter
as well you put it on underneath your
foundation and it's just gonna smooth up
the skin while creating a very luminous
beautiful glow and I kind of like this a
little bit more than this because I feel
like it's kind of evening out my skin
tone maybe I'm crazy but I do feel like
this does that for me and honestly I
have been loving this especially for a
minimal makeup date I'll just apply a
little bit of this on my skin maybe go
in with concealer it's supposed to have
like blurring technology and organic
extracts that are really gonna hydrate
the skin I do find that this is a little
more hydrating than this this is just a
little bit more luminous alright does
that make any sense I'm loving both
products but I am loving this just a
little bit more and I think this is
gonna be a staple for me in the summer
okay so I've been testing out a lot of
different foundations recently not just
these three that I'm gonna mention but
these three are a little bit newer to my
collection and I've been using these the
most in the past two weeks one of them
is kind of like
tinted moisturizer and two of them are
foundations I actually have a drugstore
foundation but the first one I'm going
to talk about is the cover effects power
play foundation this is the foundation
I'm wearing on my skin right now and I
like it first of all I love this
packaging I love that I'm seeing more
foundations come in a squeezy tube I
freakin love this packaging I love that
it's plastic you can take this anywhere
with you and you'll be good and this is
a very good foundation especially if you
have normal to oily skin for me with
really dry skin I find that I have to
use something luminous underneath in
order to make it work for me but I'm
wearing it today with this guy
underneath actually and I think it looks
great if I hydrate and I moisturize my
skin really well this does look nice on
my skin this claims to be a full
coverage foundation but in my opinion it
is more of a medium coverage although
once I apply two layers I can build up
to full and it does not look cakey it
lasts all day on the skin at least on my
skin and it doesn't feel heavy
I didn't look cakey even though it kind
of has a matte finish it doesn't look
cakey or thick or just too heavy on the
skin
and this comes in 40 shades which is
amazing but we'll continue to use this
more often just because I don't really
have anything negative to say about it I
have really been enjoying this one this
next foundation though I have been
loving if you have dry skin pay
attention this is the new flower beauty
light illusion luminous makeup nude skin
feel all-day wear a broad-spectrum SPF
18 I have really really been enjoying
this foundation if you have dry skin I
think you will really like this it gives
you about medium coverage that just
looks so healthy and beautiful on the
skin and it just looks like skin you
look so natural and radiant and dewy the
only thing is it does feel a little bit
tacky once you apply it you have to set
this foundation down because I'm not
able to slip and slide everywhere
unlike the cover FX one I feel like you
don't really need to set this even
though I did today cuz the powder I'm
gonna talk about is that good I really
loved it and it surprised me because it
lasted all day on my skin and I liked it
way way more than a flower beauty's
other foundation it's like the face
foundation no I like this one way more
and I think it's like it
Joseph to Ulta I know that flower beauty
used to be like a Walmart only brand but
now I think she is in Ulta and now has
like exclusive products to Ulta and this
is one of them I know that there's a
light illusion concealer and for some
reason I forgot to buy that because I
did purchase this myself the big issue
here is that they need to expand their
shades 100% so I've also been testing
out you makeup for ever ultra HD
Perfector blurring skin tint with SPF 25
the ultra HD stick is one of my favorite
foundation six of all time and they
really really like this a lot this is a
really nice tinted moisturizer if you're
looking for an everyday complexion
product that you're just gonna throw on
it's gonna look like skin but it is
gonna even out the skin and look nice
like it has decent coverage it wasn't
too greasy it was kind of like a
foundation texture but the lightweight
feel of a tinted moisturizer and it has
SPF so I've been liking this a lot okay
so I only have one concealer to talk
about in today's video this is the laura
mercier flawless fusion ultra long wear
concealer
they recently sent me all of their
concealers in like a PR package and I've
been testing out so much and this is the
one product that I'm like how do I feel
I still don't know I would say this has
about medium coverage I do think my
Tarte shaped tape has more coverage than
this it's nice it does wear a really
long time I did notice that it is very
long wearing like it claims but I do
think it creases a bit creases more than
my chart shape tape but says it's a
creaseless concealer but I do think it
creases and I don't know for the price I
don't think it's necessarily like the
greatest I know on sapore it has amazing
reviews and if you want to try it out I
definitely recommend you check it out
because it is good it's just not amazing
and it did not blow me away
I have other concealers in my collection
I like more than this but that's just
not so Sam okay now let's talk about
powders I have to face powders to talk
about both from the same brand this is
the Becca under-eye brightening setting
powder and this is the Becca hydro mist
set and refresh powder this is
whatever I don't really like this I know
that laura mercier has like an under eye
brightening powder that's very similar
to this
these white powders that have a little
bit of shimmer to them are not my
favourites to set my under eye even
though I like a brightening effect and I
like like a luminous look to me these
like with powders kind of make my under
eyes look a little grey I don't know if
I'm crazy but they just kind of give me
a weird cast underneath my eyes and I
don't like them at all for that so I've
been using it a lot and I gotta say I
don't like this powder at all actually
those are just not my thing
this hydro mist set and refresh powder
is so unique I've never seen anything
like this in my life this is a
translucent setting powder that's gonna
set your makeup and it's gonna make it
last all day because it does I set my
foundation with this all the time and it
lasts a long time but this product has
50% water and glycerin in it can you
believe that 50% of this powder is water
I don't know how they freaking do it
but but they do it and I know that they
do it because every time I set my face
with this my it's an experience guys you
guys need run to Sephora tell them to
give you a sample of this because it's
just so weird it feels wet on the skin
like you are setting your makeup and it
feels like you're applying wet powder on
the skin it is literally a wet powder
like it feels like you're wetting your
face when you're setting your face isn't
that crazy it's not only a freaking cool
product because I just love the feeling
but it makes my skin look really nice as
well
not for my under eyes though I don't
really like to set my under eyes with
this because I feel like it makes my
under eyes look a little strange but for
the rest of my makeup I have found the
one okay so I have two bronzers to share
with you guys one of them is more of
like a contour powder this is the take
home the bronze anti orange bronzer from
the balm it came out with a few new
shades I personally have the one called
Oscar cuz it's the one that suits my
skin toned the best I have been using
this to contour my face recently and I
really really like it I feel like this
contour stays on my skin all day it's a
super long wearing powder and it is
definitely anti Orange all of their new
take home the bronze bronzers are
answering
orange and I think their purpose was to
create like contour bronzers and I think
they did a super good job I love this
formula and I love this packaging so
sleek and tiny and the bomb is so good
they have great formulas and then these
bronzers are very different these are
new morphe bronzers which I got so
excited when I saw these in the mail
because first of all I'm obsessed with
the new morphe logo the new like morphe
branding I'm completely into it their
whole like blend the rules thing I'm
super into it so they came out with bran
tours which are bronzers and contours in
one these are the two shades
I kept the others I gave them away to my
friends because there were a bunch of
shades that didn't fit my skintone but
one that fits my skintone the best is
celebutant which is like celebrity and
debutante as I combine like bronze or
super cute and this is the one that I've
been using the most as you can see they
have their contour and one on one side
and then their bronzer on the other my
favorite way to apply these are just
mixed all together in my opinion I find
that this contour is a little bit too
deep for my skintone I would love it if
they came out with a shade lighter than
this that wasn't as light as their
lightest shade because their lightest
shade is like for a snow-white skin like
very very very fair and I feel like they
need something in between this one and
that one but I've been using this one a
lot and I just love the golden bronze
look it gives my skin I've been focusing
my brush a little bit more on this side
and it just gives me a beautiful golden
glow it's the bronzer I'm wearing on my
cheeks right now I have a little bit of
Oscar right here like on the hollows of
the cheeks but then the rest of my face
is covered in Celebi taunt wrong tour
and I really really like it NARS came
out with new highlights and these are
the three that I've been using the most
fort-de-france albatross and Capri and
when I first saw albatross I'm like oh
my god did they reformulate it are they
only gonna have these highlights
available from now on because I despise
the original albatross it is so glittery
so when I saw this I was like oh my gosh
are these the new highlights because
this formula is unlike their other
highlights it's so so different once you
apply it with the right brush you get
the most beautiful application in the
world my favorite one is Fort de France
because it's like a sham
Payne pink but it does have like a
little bit of a golden undertone it is
beautiful when you apply it with a small
dense brush you do get such a nice
application you just have to build it up
if you want a very subtle glow just one
layer will do the trick but if you want
something very illuminating you will
have to build it up these have zero
glitter zero shimmer it's just a sheen I
really really love these pixie actually
recently teamed up with a few Beauty
vloggers and collabs on a bunch of
products and I was gonna say the eye
shadow palette and the lip gloves like
for later but I'm just gonna do it all
now since it's all pixie they teamed up
with dude secondi and they came out with
two palettes one of them I think was
like a blush palette or a lip huh oh my
gosh I don't remember because I gave
that one to my mom but this is the one
that I kept this is the sweet glow
palette and it's full of highlight
shades I would say this is a highlight
slash eyeshadow palette because it's
full of just straight-up highlights but
you can totally use these as eyeshadows
I used this one as an eyeshadow the
other day all over my lid and it was
stunning amazing I actually mixed these
two but this one here and this one I mix
them together to pop it right on the top
of my cheekbone right here so like that
intense glow that's right here that's
this guy this has an incredible formula
I mean all of these are so ultra
metallic I can't even express to you how
incredible they are you do not need to
wet them they're that good on their own
and they look insane
pixie also teamed up with Whaley oh my
god I don't know what to say her last
name home oh it's like getting a weird
cursive and I can't really tell what
those letters are this is the let's talk
eyes eye shadow palette and it's such a
nice I shot a pilot if you want
something that's perfect for everyday I
have a mixture of literally three
different palettes on my eyes today but
I have this as my brow bone highlight
and then I have these like thrown in my
crease as well they blend so well so
easily so smooth really really good
little palette and then I've also been
loving this pixie gloss this is in
collaboration with Chloe Morello I love
her she's so beautiful this is the lip
icing in the shade cake this smells so
good it smells like a creamsicle one of
those orange like creamsicle pops to
have the cream
inside but they you know talking abouts
like a creamsicle and it's just full of
little golden and pink flecks like all
throughout this gloss it looks so pretty
top on pinky colors or like nude colors
now let's talk about some eyeshadow
palettes that I've recently been using
and what I think about them a palette
that shocked me to my very core I love
this I highly recommend this this is the
BH Cosmetics glam reflection gilded
palette they came off a few different
ones like a pink one or something but
this is the one that I have and it is
very very nice very nice it's full of
all of those warm delicious sunset
colors it reminds me a lot of the
Natasha's anona sunset palette it's very
similar it's not as good but then again
it's nowhere near as expensive so I'm so
impressed with this palette this is a
$10 eyeshadow palette and you get a
fantastic mirror and you get so many
eyeshadows and you get a full look out
of this because you have this really
deep chocolate color that just ties
everything together and these mats are
incredible
I would say the mats are way better than
the shimmery colors you are gonna have
to use fix+ with a couple of these
shimmers but it's not that big of a deal
I mean I wit I shadow all the time
high-end drugstore it it's okay I love
this palette I highly recommend it one
that I was like not super impressed with
believe it or not this is the new Urban
Decay backtalk palette I also have a
mixture of this on my eyes today I have
a little bit of this a little bit of
this and a little bit of another palette
that I'm gonna show you after this um
this palette is okay personally for me
there are a couple things I don't like
about it I don't love the packaging you
know that it was made this way to be
convenient
so like save up space because you have
your blushes and highlights on this side
you have this mirror and then on
side you have your eyeshadow palette so
it's super convenient yes but this comes
off and you cannot close this palette
unless this mirror is in it so do not
lose this mirror so that kind of like
throws me off of it and the formula on a
few of these eyeshadows aren't my
favorite like Hardy felt it's great as a
I shadow but I don't love it on the face
I love these blushes but I don't think
we have enough mats on the eyeshadow
section I do love the shade called
attitude I think it's the star in this
in this palette I just don't think this
palette is special enough in my opinion
it's cool but for me it's not convenient
and it's not as good as I thought it was
gonna be okay and then the last I shadow
palette I have to talk about is a very
very very very pricey one and that is
the Pat McGrath mothership subversive
levy and Rose our shadow palette rarely
do I come across a Pat McGrath product
that actually sucks like our products
are incredible
they just have incredibly high price
tags this palette is $55 and I just
purchased this off of Sephora just a
couple weeks ago and the reason I wanted
to talk about it in today's video
besides the fact that it's new is that I
am way more impressed with this
packaging that I have been in the past
with Pat McGrath the packaging that the
actual products came in was never as
cool as the box that came in you know
and when I got this in the mail I was
like oh okay this is the box I'm going
to open it and I'm gonna see a smaller
palette inside but the box is actually
the palette the eyeshadows are like
stuck in here so like this is the whole
box and I think that this is awesome
because you get a full blown mirror in
here and you get your eyeshadows like
right here in the box so I do think the
packaging is very unique and very cool
in this one which is why I really like
it I also went with the pink palette
because I thought it was a little bit
more unique for me I'm wearing this
color all over my lid today and then I
have this pink one on my lower lashline
smudged homograph eyeshadows remind me a
lot of Natasha Danone eyeshadows they're
so buttery and creamy but what that
being said they are really really pricey
I've been getting so many questions
about the new Natasha the north tropic
palette and then
like mini sunset palettes and I actually
have not received those pallets yet I'm
not sure if I'm gonna get them for PR I
I'm not sure but if I do get them I will
let you know how I feel about them it's
just I've heard a lot of mixed reviews
about the tropic palette and I'm getting
very very worried because if Natasha's
are gonna change your eyeshadow formula
I am going to I don't know what I'm
gonna do but I'm gonna be very very
upset so I'm gonna see if I get that in
the mail and then maybe I'll play around
with it and let you guys know next up I
want to talk about these new glossy a
lid stars I have two shades I have herb
and moon and at first I was so excited
for these I have really been into like
liquid eyeshadows and I thought that
these were gonna blow me away and they
just didn't when I first watched them on
my hands I was like yes
these are winners because after about
three minutes they did not budge but on
the lids they really crease on me and I
was just really disappointed by moon
specifically like every time I put it on
I was like I don't really like it
there's nothing here and didn't do much
for me and this one was okay it's just I
feel like there are better liquid
eyeshadows out there and honestly I know
that glossier has like incredible
packaging and their marketing is just
amazing and like you just want to buy
all their products but for me these are
pass dose of colors recently sent me all
of their new set the tone cream matte
eye colors I give two of them to Amelia
and I've been trying these out well I
mean I've only tried out Shady and which
was the other one is like a brown only
tried on Shady and Rodeo but I've got to
say I think these are gonna be major
winners when I first blended these out
on my hand I was like oh man these are
way too creamy they're just gonna smear
everywhere I don't like it but when I
actually used it on my eyes they are
creamy but when they set they do not
budge which is amazing because they're
creamy enough to really blend out you
can work with it a little bit it's not
drying it's not like chalky they have
such a buttery formula I really really
have been liking those a lot and then we
have our lips category which I only have
one product my lips category and that is
the new hi-fi sign lip glosses from
urban decay this reminds me of old
school packaging I'm not crazier that
they used to packaging like this in back
in the day which I'm all about I love
the 90s vibes this gives me this is in
the shade of fuel and this one is
favorite out of all of them I love this
new color because it has a little bit of
a shimmer to it these are very very
pigmented and very shiny they go on very
glossy I like them a lot they do have
like a mint chocolatey taste to it and
it does feel very tingling and cooling
on the lips which is what I really like
about it okay so those were all the
products I feel like I've been sitting
here talking for two hours I kind of
haven't been that I already know this
video is a million years long
oops you don't see happy guys don't mind
