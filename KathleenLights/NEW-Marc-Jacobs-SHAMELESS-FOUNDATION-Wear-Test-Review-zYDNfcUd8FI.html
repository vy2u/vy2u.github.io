a first impressions anywhere test I'm
gonna be reviewing the brand new Marc
Jacobs shameless foundation this
foundation just recently launched they
have 29 shades
total and it retails for $46 I know it
looks small I mean it is small but I
know it looks smaller than like a
regular foundation but it does have one
fluid ounce which is pretty standard for
foundations and today we're gonna be
putting it to the test I'm gonna wear it
throughout the day and I'll come back at
the end of the night and let you know
how I feel about it and if you saw my
most recent random rambles video I have
been so excited to try out this
foundation I hope I love it though it
has so many amazing claims and I just
love this packaging I love squeezy tubes
they're my favorite I know some people
say it like cheapens the foundation but
I love it because I break everything so
having something in a little squeezy
tube I just prefer it over a pump you
can actually control what you're
squeezing out you know what I mean like
I love it
so basically this is supposed to be a
24-hour foundation it's supposed to look
great all day I'm not gonna test it for
24 hours maybe like 7 and supposedly
this has like undetectable SPF defense
of SPF 25 in it and it's oil free it's
weightless and it's supposed to have
buildable medium coverage that blends
seamlessly so all those things sound so
amazing I just hope it doesn't emphasize
my dry skin bleeds so I'm gonna pick my
hair up and zoom you guys in where's my
scrunchie okay so I just watched a few
of them on the back of my hand and this
one seems to be the color that's gonna
match me best this is light y2 70
and I'm gonna go in with primer of
course I'm just gonna use my most used
primer it's my tried-and-true just that
I can give this foundation a fair shot
this is the Beca first light priming
filter or backlight backlight priming
first light first light priming filter
all right so I'm gonna find this two
separate ways like I usually do with my
foundation reviews I'm gonna use my
cosmetics love is the foundation brush
on this side of my face
and then the fenty beauty sponge on this
side of my face I'm gonna squeeze some
of this on the back of my hand no dog
hair see like such control I love but
this squeeze it tube I hear this has
like some eye color I don't know my tan
is like fading at the moment so I'm like
not tan but I'm not as fair as usual so
no say
okay I don't want to get too ahead of
myself let me finish applying all of it
before I say I don't like it let me see
let me see okay so this is one layer of
the foundation on this side of my face
you can see the coverage compared to
this side it is about medium coverage is
this is not full coverage by any means
but I usually don't mind that I actually
like like coverage foundations I like
medium coverage I like full cover I like
it all it just depends how it sits on my
skin and what mood I'm in that day like
depending on what coverage I want this
is weird because it's lightweight it
doesn't feel like anything it doesn't
have that much coverage yet I see it
sitting on my face like look let me show
you it kind of looks a little bit patchy
and it's like sitting on top of the skin
right here excuse my super crusty lips
Invisalign makes my mouth really dry but
do you see what I'm talking about I know
I'm gonna do another layer just to see
oh my gosh it's kind of lifting here on
my mouth like trying to add more
coverage lift it up the first layer of
foundation and then kind of made it
cakey looking oh my gosh
please tell me you guys can see that it
looks so patchy right here all right I'm
gonna try going in with a sponge on this
side hopefully that works better okay so
it does seem to be blending in better on
this side of my face
oh my gosh yes it looks way way way way
better with a sponge
all right that's been sitting on my skin
for a few seconds now I'm gonna do
another layer yes I yeah yes I much
prefer the side with the sponge like
it's crazy the difference okay so this
is the side with a damped sponge and
this is with the brush and I love this
brush I apply so many foundations with
this brush but oh my gosh look how weird
it looks yet this side doesn't look like
that
I'm gonna see if adding a little bit
more kind of fixes this situation here
you shouldn't see oh okay actually yeah
it's fixing it a little bit barely but
you know it's doing something basically
I think you should totally apply this
with a Beauty Blender I don't know if
you have oily skin but if you have dry
skin and you want to try out this
foundation you definitely need a damp
sponge okay this little section right
here is very me crazy but yet this side
looks so nice and it has a very natural
finish alright so I do like this side I
do not like this side at all at all at
all I will never apply this with a brush
again and hopefully it wears nicely I
might like this at the end of the day
well I might like this side at the end
the day who knows so really quickly I'm
gonna go and finish up the rest of my
makeup and then I will be right back
okay so I'm back after like a hundred
hours when I turned off my camera to
finish up the rest of my makeup I looked
at my phone and it was 256 and it is now
currently 512 so I've been gone for over
two hours now I just got carried away I
was doing my makeup and then I was
playing this porter and I was just doing
other things taking my time and now I'm
back first of all my lips are so dry I
totally regret putting on this wedding
wild cat suit liquid lipstick because my
lips are already super super crusty I'm
just gonna pop on some moonchild because
I can't handle it so I know it's only
been two hours but I feel like I already
feel some type of way I don't love it I
really don't love it it just doesn't sit
that nicely on my skin and I was
realizing when I was applying the rest
of my makeup my bronzer was looking a
little bit patchy even my blush looked a
little bit patchy and I noticed what I
want to go highlight my face my texture
was emphasized a little bit more than
usual and I know highlights emphasize
your texture but I've used my color pop
highlight palette a hundred times and I
never really noticed that I don't really
beast the foundation I don't know if the
foundation is just like so matte and dry
that the highlight looks weird on it I
had to grab my other mirror so I could
look real up-close yeah you see even my
nose looks ke but I will say a major pro
is I
this foundation on for like over two
hours like I said and my smile lines
aren't that bad usually foundation sinks
in they're really really good but I feel
like it's not so bad I'm really
impressed with that cuz usually they
look crazy after about an hour I think
my biggest pet peeve in a foundation is
when it sinks into my smile lines and I
gotta say like 90% of my foundations do
that 99% of my foundations do that but
the fact that this one doesn't kind of
makes me happy I don't know like I said
it's only been about two hours so I will
update you guys at the end of the day
and let you know like my complete final
thoughts but so far it's an hello my
people so at the end of the night is
currently 11 p.m. I wanted to make it to
midnight but my buddy cannot I just
cannot I'm so sleepy so I've been
wearing this foundation let me see I
finished my makeup like around 3 o'clock
so it's like around 8 hours that's
actually a pretty good wear test but I
think so let's see let's see looking at
my skin up close I don't absolutely hate
it I honestly think I have to play
around with it a little bit more I think
if I try using this in a few different
ways I might get it to work for me also
my nose you can just see the foundation
sitting on my nose but when it comes to
my face honestly the only issue I see is
this side it's almost $50 and it just
does not look that good on my skin I do
want to mix it with other foundations I
do want to play around with it a little
bit more maybe it'll perform better on
the outside of my face and I'll use a
different foundation like in my t-zone
in my really dry areas because I have
had this foundation on for like eight
hours now and everything is still on my
face like my highlight is there my
bronzer my blush everything is still
100% on my face so I definitely think it
is long wearing I just I'm not crazy
about the formula so right now I am
rating this guy like a c-minus this side
of my face is a d-minus but anyway
that's what this video I think that's
all I wanted to say let me know in the
comments below if you plan on trying
this foundation also let me know if you
have oily skin and you've tried it do
you like it or let me know if you have
dry skin and you've tried it do you like
it just let me know if you've tried it
like I would love to know your thoughts
I really really really wanted to love it
so I'm good
try my best to make it work but that's
expensive and I don't think it's worth
it really leave me all your thoughts
down below that completes this video
guys thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
I know it looks small but it acted well
thank God it's plastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
