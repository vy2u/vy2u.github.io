hey guys so today's video I don't know
why I'm out of breath I've been out of
breath all day I don't know what okay so
today's video is a lip swatch video and
a review on the new Milani Milani did I
say that weird Milani amore matte lip
creams aka liquid lipsticks everyone and
their mama is coming out with liquid
lipsticks I know I agree it's like oh oh
everyday someone's coming out with
liquid lipsticks but I'm particularly
excited for these because they are from
the drugstore and to my knowledge these
are one of the very few liquid lipsticks
at the drugstore I know that NYX
actually just came out with like actual
liquid lipsticks not their soft matte
lip creams they came out with like real
liquid lipsticks and I think that this
is the other the only other brand that
has liquid lipsticks out I mean if you
consider color pop but color pop is not
sold at drugstores so I was really
really excited about these I went out
and purchased two four of them they're
right here there was a few more colors
that I really wasn't too interested in
but then there was one that I wanted so
bad it was like a dark dark brown but of
course the one that I wanted was sold
out of course but I'm going back for
that baby I'm going back for that baby
okay so quickly I just want to say I'm
so glad that I only picked up four
because this was a mission to film after
the first swatch the foundation around
my mouth came off because I was
scrubbing to get this off so the lip
swatches are were kind of weird I know
that they probably look weird
and I want to address something a lot of
people are always telling me like why or
the comments on my videos like why
doesn't she
line her full lip like up at the top and
I will tell you why because I always
have like a white rim here and that's
because I only fill my lips to where my
lip color is because every time that I
go over like the lip line here like you
guys want me to do I look like Miranda
sings like I kind of did it for the last
lip swatch I don't know if you can tell
in the lip swatches but I kind of over
lined my natural lip and I feel like I
look like Miranda sings like I look like
a clown like I don't know that's why I
always feel weird over lining my lips
because I feel like I look like an idiot
so I only put lip color to wear my
natural lip color ends anyway that has
nothing to do with this video these were
so hard to take off the only thing that
took them off were these tarts fresh
eyes maracuja waterproof eye makeup
remover wipes which I hate for my eye
makeup they suck they leave my eyes
super oily but they are amazing as
liquid lipsticks remover who would have
thunk it anyway so let me get on with
the review because I've been rambling a
bit a lot I love them I'm gonna flat out
say that I love them I do think that
some people might not might not like
them though let me tell you the pros and
cons let's start off with the pros they
are so long wearing I wore this one
yesterday this one yes the dark like
mocha color this one in beloved I wore
yesterday and he was on my lips the
entire freakin day and it did not budge
that's why they're a little bit hard to
remove but with those wives say or with
oil they come off really fast but it
does not but they have such a delicious
Bakery scent if you're not into sweet
scents you might not like this but I
mean you don't smell it anymore once
it's on your lips but I love the scent
so many liquid lipsticks kind of smell
chemically Milani hit the nail on the
head it's a super delicious smell also I
love the packaging I don't find that it
leaks it locks into place I really love
the color selection this is really the
only nude but these colors are so
gorgeous there's not one color that I
picked up that i think is ugly I think
they're all really pretty at least
favorite is the
dude but I will go into the why in a bit
another great thing is the price these
are under seven dollars I got mine at
Walgreens I've only seen these at
Walgreens I went to CVS to check if they
were there but they weren't so then I
went to the Walgreens by my house and
they were there so yeah like I was
saying the price is right I'm gonna talk
about cons really quickly okay so the
formula of this I actually really like
the formula they are very very similar
the closest formulation to these are the
Lime Crime Velveteen I cannot feel it on
my lips there is no tackiness whatsoever
let me do a kiss proof kiss says nada
these are literally liquid lipsticks
they aren't that moosie formula so if
you are someone who likes that moosie
texture more I wouldn't necessarily go
with these I will say that around like
the aro mark when they start to fade
away they start to almost crumble a
little bit but that's after wearing them
for a long time I don't find it crumbles
on me before that I don't find that they
dry out my lips though I mean like I've
said before I'm someone who could wear
cement on my lips and it doesn't bother
me but I like that they're liquidy and
that I can't that I kept feel them at
all there's no tackiness but it's not
super drying I like that a lot I do
though I do recommend using these with a
lip liner because I found it a little
bit hard to get really perfect around my
lips as he probably saw in the lip
swatches it was a little bit hard to get
like really precise so I personally
would go in with a lip liner and they
put these on top and I feel like they
would last forever and they would look
awesome I haven't tried that but it will
the one that I highly highly highly
highly recommend out of all of them is
this one this one is in the shade lust
for some odd reason this one feels
almost moosie like this one has a more
hydrating formula than these I don't
know why I don't ask me I don't know but
this one lust is my favorite by far the
most beautiful I love it so much the one
that I don't really like um that I would
have returned if anything was a door
simply because this one got really
crusty on the inside of my lips really
similar
I'm associate Speer Hollywood pure
Hollywood does that to me this is
actually a very similar color similar
color to that but I get that white
crusty line and inside of my lips that I
get sometimes and yeah I don't like that
and this one kind of um stayed a little
bit tacky and it was liquidy or like
this one was very very very thin
compared to the other ones this one for
some reason was liquidy or I don't know
this one's not my favorite it uh no I
hear but these I cannot complain I'm
sure there are a couple things they're
not great about them but I mean they are
under seven dollars and they hire a
local Walgreens that's beautiful I'm
gonna go get that dark brown color I
don't remember the name but I'm gonna go
get it
so yeah that's really I have to say
about them I hope you guys enjoyed this
