a simple quick kind of video well click
no we are going to be discussing the Wet
n Wild mega glow highlighting powders
they came out with four new shades and
those are the ones we will be talking
about today well I'm going to discuss
all six colors because they do have six
in total but they just launched four new
shades and I stopped that it needed a
video I thought that these products just
needed its own video because I'm just so
excited about these but I just want to
talk about them today so that's what
we're doing I'm going to be watching
them on my arm for you guys I'm going to
show you the colors we're going to talk
about them the formula so if you guys
didn't already know wet and wild had
originally released two shades in their
mega glow highlighting powder range and
I think it was sometime last year I
don't exactly remember when these came
out but they release precious petals
which is this really pretty like peachy
gold and then they also release crown of
my canopy which is more of like a copper
shade this is a beautiful highlighting
powder for deeper skin tones and I
remember everyone went crazy over these
they were nowhere to be found I was
getting tweets upon tweets of people
looking for them like in all different
types of Walgreens they were a hot topic
there for a while and I guess when a
while noticed that so they released four
more colors the only thing I will say is
that I don't love the four colors they
just came out with I do like two of them
a lot but these other two are more
colorful and obviously I'm just one
person it doesn't really matter what I
think
I know colorful highlights like this are
very in right now everyone is wearing
these like unicorn highlights but for me
they're not my favorite but I mean it is
nice that they released colorful you
know a colorful selection these
highlights are extremely affordable they
retail for $4.99 and you can get the new
ones that just came out on the Wet n
Wild website or on Ulta calm I believe I
don't know if right now it's only online
I'm not exactly sure these highlights
were sent to me but this video is not
sponsored they didn't ask me to make
this video I'm just giving you like my
truth aquamarine highlights and I felt
like it needed a video I don't know
okay so let's discuss each color at a
time because I do feel like a couple of
these have a different formula I don't
know if I'm crazy
but I feel that way so let's talk about
it I'm not going to go on about these
because I've already mentioned these in
the past they have been out for a long
time and this video is mainly about the
new colors that came out but I love the
formula on both of these I like to eat
highlights a lot these two are very soft
powders and they're very reflective they
almost feel creamy when you put your
hand in them I will say precious petals
is a little creamier than crowd of my
canopy this one for some reason is
definitely powdery err and you can see
that when your likes watching them or
like feeling them but when you apply it
to the skin it does look really nice
it's way too dark for me so I don't
really use it but I have a friend who
uses this all the time and love this
color but precious petals look so nice
when I have a tan it's still too dark
for me when I have my natural skin color
but when I have a tan this looks so
pretty on the cheeks very reflective
like you would never think that this is
$4.99
I love precious petals all right now for
the new shades I am so excited about
these I love wet and wild so much it's
one of my favorite drugstore brands and
I love how inexpensive they are so when
they come out with it cool stuff like
this I get really excited like I said
they did release four shades and these
are the four colors right here the only
thing I will say is I wish they would
have released a highlight for a very
very fair-skinned like extremely
fair-skinned because even though this
one in blossom glow is very light it
does have kind of like a pink undertone
and I'm not sure how much that's going
to show on the cheek when I apply it I
don't know if this is light enough for
extremely fair-skinned so anyway let's
go into watching these colors I'm
actually going to be applying these two
colors on my face so you can see me
swatching them like live on the skin and
then these two I'll just swatch on my
arm because I only have two cheekbones
we're going over this before I do that
let's just go into arm swatches of all
six colors roll clip
okay so the first one I'm going to be
trying out on my face is blossom glow
this one is that really pretty light
pinky ivory shade this one really
impressed me when i swatched it for the
first time because it didn't feel
powdery like some of these do is felt
very creamy and very reflective like
very much Halleck I'm going to take my
favorite highlighting brush this is the
wave oh 134 this doesn't have kick up
when you put your brush in like not a
lot of powder soy sauce
this one is really intense really
reflective you can kind of see it when I
look straight like you can kind of see
the pinky ashy undertone which is why I
think they should come out with a light
color that's a little bit more champagne
and I feel like that would be a little
bit more wearable but if you're into
these pinky highlights which I totally
am that is like glowy it's not very
natural I will say that if you're
looking for a natural highlights this is
not the one but if you're into a heavy
glow then this is definitely the one for
you
okay and on this side we are going to be
trying out this really pretty gold shade
you can see the difference between this
one and precious petals this one is like
a gold my candle and this one is called
golden flower crown this one does have
some kick up when you put your brush in
and this one is one of those that felt a
little bit powdery when I was watching
it
I do like the gold I think it is really
pretty I thought it wasn't going to be
really highlighting because it did have
a softer more powdery consistency but I
mean even though it's not as reflective
as this like this one is very metallic
you still see it I still think it's very
high lighting you can see it sitting on
my skin though it does look a little bit
powdery on the skin and honestly with
just a little bit of setting spray that
fixes the problem actually let's do that
I'm going to apply some setting spray
I'm going to take me more food prep and
set makeup setting spray drench my face
in it obviously okay so that really
helped I love applying setting spray on
top of my highlight because it just
makes it look so much more natural and
it even made this side look a lot
prettier like in person it looks even
more natural but it's still kept it's
reflectiveness this one because it had
more of a powdery formula adding the
setting spray kind of dulled it a little
bit it toned it down just a tad but I'm
going to apply it a little more but it
did take away the powdery look which is
really nice and just applying a little
bit more on top will probably just make
it pop right there
now it's like whoa glowy oh my gosh I
really like this one I like it a lot
more now that I apply setting spray and
just apply it a little bit more on top
looks a little bit more natural and it
doesn't look like it's like sitting on
the skin like it was before so yes I
like both of these you could totally
make it look really intense or really
natural depending on how you apply it
and what you do those to get a thumbs-up
for me you have to work with them just a
little bit but there are five dollars
and I think it's so worth it it doesn't
break the bank and you still get like a
beautiful JLo glow I don't know why a
couple of these have a different texture
than others but you know otherwise it at
all okay and then the last two shades
look like this you already saw these
swatched but I did want to mention them
really quickly and tell you my thoughts
this one in botanic dream has a really
great formula the same kind of feeling
as precious petals and blossom glow it
almost feels wet and it's very very
metallic and then this one I don't
really like at all actually I have to be
honest this one is called royal calyx
and it is a really pretty purple color
but it does have a bit of glitter in it
has kind of like a chunky knit to it so
it doesn't really
watch as creamy and as smooth as all
these other highlights do I don't know I
just feels a little thick and chunky I
know it sounds weird if you're into
Purple's like this though if you like
that purpley highlight on the skin you
might really like this definitely check
it out anyway if you're into these
colors but the rest I adore these
especially for the price you cannot go
wrong with these actually you know what
what is what is I tried to dust away the
highlight I already have let's see let's
try to take this off oh yeah it kind of
just came off this one is on a little
bit stronger because we did apply it on
top of the setting spray so I kind of
made like a sandwich so it's a little
bit more long wearing when you do that
okay so I'm going to take volcanic dream
this is obviously going to be too dark
for me but oh that's beautiful
oh my Gooch obviously a colorful
highlight but it's so look I really I
really like this one okay now let's try
this one even though I already told you
guys it's not my favorite well
actually apply to the skin it's not so
bad it's not so bad I see the glitter
though I see the glitter it now oh I I
wanna just like see it they're just like
laying on my skin and then you see the
little glitters just by the way I just
filmed this little clip portion right
after I finished filming this video
because I was like with man I could just
apply it on top of my skin on top of the
other highlights why not just to try it
out by the way look of dark that looks
on me see like it looks pretty like in
the life but then you look at anyway so
now I'm gonna go back in time in the
Brecon time now to the Kathleen who
didn't know if she was about to film
this part right now so yeah that was my
review on these highlights I hope this
video helps you out in some way maybe
you were interested in these new shades
and you wanted to see swatches and a
review of some sort I hope this video
helped you internal but that completes
this video thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
