tutorial on this look I'm wearing right
now I wanted to do a New Year's Eve
makeup tutorial something that I would
wear for New Year's Eve if I was going
to like an epic party or something but
I'm not I'm staying home on New Year's
Eve but if I wasn't this is the look I
would be doing it do a New Year's Eve
look every single year I think I've been
doing them since I started my channel
and I always try to make them just a
little bit more glam than my normal
tutorials so we've got liner we've got
lashes and we even have glitter on the
eyes I think I always incorporate
glitter in my New Year's Eve looks it's
like a must you know so I made another
attempt at a cut crease and even though
this is a very bold look I used very
natural neutral colors so it's extremely
wearable and I really hope you guys
enjoy it oh by the way so I forgot what
company but a company sent me one of
these little board thingies a few months
ago and I was like oh my gosh that's
perfect to write like little messages on
it and to like hang it up on my wall so
I mean it's just sitting there for now
but I am gonna hang it up on my wall
once I get rid of these frames I'm gonna
be switching some around I'm not taking
all of them off but anyway I thought it
would be cool to like hang that up and
then like write little things on it like
right now it says Happy New Year cuz I
didn't know what else to put it but yeah
I just wanted to mention that for some
strange strange reason but anyway if you
guys want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching ok so I've
already primed my eyelids with my Tarte
shape tape concealer and I've already
set them and now I'm gonna go into my
dream Street palette and I'm gonna use
the shade Moony to highlight underneath
my brow bone and then I'm gonna take one
more shade in this palette which is this
one and I'm gonna use this as my crease
color these are the only two shadows I'm
using from dream Street the other
shadows are single shadows but I'm just
using this color to buff into my crease
I'm pretty much putting this everywhere
it's gonna be my main crease shade my
transition shade and then I'm gonna go
in to this single eyeshadow right here
it's from Anastacio it's called fawn and
on a more precise crease brush this one
has a point to it I'm gonna be doing the
exact same thing but I'm not
this color up to far I'm really focusing
this right in the crease and then I
wanted a brown that was a bit cooler not
as warm as the other shades so this is a
morphe single eyeshadow this is number
63 and I'm gonna be doing the exact same
thing with the same brush just focusing
this right in the crease
I'm gonna take shooting star from my
dream Street palette and I'm just gonna
use that to kind of buff out the edges
and blend out any harsh lines that I
created with the other shades
now I'm just going back into that morphe
eyeshadow and just doing the exact same
thing adding a little bit more of this
shade to my crease okay so now is when I
do well now is when I attempt my cut
crease I'm trying to get better at it
I'm really not the best eye
sometimes my eyes are uneven that kind
of happened to me today but I'm really
trying to perfect it but basically I you
just add concealer on your lid you kind
of see what I'm doing there but you just
map out and you shape out the cut crease
with concealer it's actually very easy
it's just hard for me to get both of the
eyes to look exactly the same so I'm
just adding the concealer I'm using the
Tarte shape tape concealer to create
this cut crease and now I'm going to
take Mooney again this is the shade I
used under my brow bone and I'm just
gonna pop that on my entire lid
everywhere I put down the concealer I'm
gonna apply Mooney on top so since it's
New Year's Eve I did want the lid to
Sparkle a little bit so I took the
Natasha de Nona crystal chrome top coat
thing and this is in the shade nude and
I just applied it right on top of Mooney
and it created such a pretty like nude
shimmer I love this thing but I did want
to add just a little bit more sparkle so
I took the Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter eyeliner in the shade pyro
and I'm just applying that right on top
now I'm gonna add a winged liner to this
look I think every cut crease needs a
winged liner this is the M cosmetics
illustrative eyeliner in the brush tip
in black and then I just took em
cosmetics like regular eyeliner in black
and eye tight lined with that and then I
popped on some falsies these are from
the brand kiss and then I am moving on
to the face before finishing the eyes
you guys know the drill for primer I'm
taking my Becca first light priming
filter and I'm actually using staples in
this video like my favorite most loved
long-wearing products that I know are
gonna last me through New Year's Eve I
decided to use those products in this
video of course because this is
literally the look I would do for New
Year's Eve so the foundation I'm wearing
is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick
in one 1/8 I love it
it's amazing in photos and I wear it all
the time it's perfect for a night out
for concealer I'm using the Urban Decay
all nighter concealer trying to switch
it up from the usual shape tape I love
this concealer as well so full coverage
and it does last all frickin night it's
amazing
/ powder I'm going to take my glossy a
router and I'm going to use this to set
my under eye concealer and everywhere
else I put down the concealer
and then I'm gonna go ahead and finish
up the eyes I usually do a very intense
smoky lower lashline but I thought you
know what I'm just gonna pop on some
eyeliner and some mascara I'm gonna
switch it up so this is the what is this
the Thrive cosmetics liquid lash
extension mascara it's amazing and then
that completes the eyes to contour the
skin I took the makeup geek sunkissed
fair-skinned bronzer on my little Lisa
Frank contour brush and I use this to
chisel out the cheeks
to add a more bronzy glow i'm taking one
of my favorite bronzers of all time this
is the Too Faced sweethearts bronzer and
I'm just applying that right on top of
the makeup geek one just meshing those
two bronzers together to add a little
bit more of a glow for blush I have to
go in with a Tarte blush of course these
lasts all night this one is called
seduce and I'm just popping that on my
cheeks with my little tart blush brush I
love this blush I love all of the
Amazonian clay blushes they are amazing
and then for highlight I'm going in with
something that's really gonna stand out
and that of course is the girl lactic
luminous face veil in the shade
see-through this is the perfect
highlight for the night for a night on
the town because it's really intense and
it just looks stunning at night and in
parties under lights it's amazing so I
definitely had to go with this one
and then for my lips I wanted something
that was gonna match my crease so I went
in with the colour-pop ultra satin lip
in the shade point-0
and then I topped it off with my newest
gloss this is the moonchild lip gloss
also from colour-pop and I'm just
popping that right on top to make it a
little bit less Brown and more nude and
I really loved how it turned out
I hope you guys enjoyed this look that
