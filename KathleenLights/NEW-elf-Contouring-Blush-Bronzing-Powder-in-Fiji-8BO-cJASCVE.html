a review and demo on two products that
recently came out on eyes lips face comm
also known as elf they just recently
came out with a new contouring blush and
bronzing powder and a new blending brush
from their studio line so I will be
talking about both of these products in
this video today I was only going to do
a video on this but I decided to just
throw this in there just in case anybody
was wondering about this brush elf was
nice enough to send me these two
products probably because I spend so
much money on their website anyway that
they decided to send this to me and I
actually wasn't asked to make a video or
anything they just wanted to send them
to me for me to try out but I really
wanted to make the video because I think
they are great products you guys know I
am a big fan of elf I do these random
giant elf halls on my channel every time
elf is 50% off and this is no exception
so this is what the packaging looks like
when you buy it online I'm not exactly
sure when this will be going to Target
or any places that sells elf I just know
for right now they are available on eyes
lips face comm if you guys have been
watching my videos for a while you know
that I am a big fan of their other
contouring blush and bronzing powders
I'm pretty sure I have all of them and I
have purchased them with my own money I
just think it's really convenient to
have a bronzer and a blush and one
little compact but what makes this new
one special is that it is both a matte
bronzer and a matte blush so I'm pretty
sure all the other ones either have like
shimmer in it or has some sort of satin
finish this one is completely matte and
I was really excited when I saw this and
when I got it for the first time when I
started watching them I'm so so happy
with this I think it's a great product
they kind of changed the packaging on
the outside of these this is what the
original one looks like and this is what
the new one looks like pretty much just
wrote elf a little bit bigger on the
front but everything else is the same
when you open it it comes with a mirror
just like they all do and when I first
saw this I wasn't gonna lie I was like
whoa that blush is so dark but it
actually does blend out really really
nicely it is the blush I am wearing on
my cheeks right now and you could
definitely build this up to get a really
really intense color or you could just
shoot it out and give yourself like a
nice flush of color I really love this
bronzer because it's not
to warm it's not like a super orange
color so you can definitely still
contour with this I used it today to
contour and I love the formula of this
bronzer I'm not explain it but when I
first watched it on my hand I was like
whoa that is super super super creamy
it's not chalky whatsoever like I wish
you guys can just go and feel up on this
bronzer because it is not chalky it's
not super powdery it's just like that
perfect formula and I just really really
liked it so what I did to contour is I
took my ELF complexion brush and I
dipped it into the bronzing powder and I
just started to carve out my cheekbones
with this you can get a more precise
contour if you use a smaller brush but I
don't like super super carved out
cheekbones I just like a little bit of a
contour sometimes so that's why I use
this brush so I just ran this across my
cheekbones I also brought it up into my
forehead underneath my neck and around
my nose area just so that everything can
match and I really did like the color it
is a little bit warm but not something
that makes me look like a noble looper
or anything like that I think it would
look really good in a lot of different
skin tones if you're very very fair use
a very light hand with this but I think
it would be perfect from like light to
medium skin tones I just think it would
match a lot of different skin tones as
for the blush I took my it cosmetics
blush brush dabbed it in and then
lightly applied it to my cheeks and then
just blended it out I'm not someone who
likes a crazy blush color on the cheeks
so I just kept working it into my cheeks
until it kind of faded nicely actually
really liked this blush though I was
surprised that I liked it so much
because I think it's going to be so
perfect for a fall because it has that
mob undertone it's not just like a basic
pink blush it definitely has that
purpley mauve look to it I think this
would look so beautiful on darker skin
tones like absolutely beautiful and
again if you do have a lighter skin then
go with a very very light hand with the
blush as well I was just really
pleasantly surprised with this little
duo I love all of them but this is a
great add to my collection because it is
matte and I think it's going to be
perfect for fall because of the deeper
shades in this this is again in the
shade Fiji and it is available right now
as lip space calm
okay so really quickly I want to talk
about their blending brush that just
came out I put it right back into the
packaging so you can see what it looks
like it's in the same packaging all
their brushes are but when I first took
this out of the slip I was like oh engi
immediately reminded me of the Mac 217
the second I saw it this is the Mac 217
and this is the elf blending brush as
you can see it kind of has a very
similar shape but when you turn on its
side the Mac one is definitely fluffier
than the elf one but it has a very
similar shape I don't know if you can
tell it's similar when I saw I knew it
was kind of like their version of a Mac
217 which made me so excited and even
though I don't think it's as good I
still think that the Mac's at 217 blows
any other out of the water it's similar
and I think that if you're on a budget
it will work it's a three dollar brush
and it is really really soft I used it
today on my eye look I dipped it into
like a medium tone brown and I started
applying it on the outer V of my eye
what I did was I started to pack it on
the outer V and then I started to bring
it into the crease and when I brought it
into the crease I kind of turned the
brush on its side and then I just
continued to do that just pack it on the
outer V and then blended it out in my
crease by turning it on its side the
only thing I wish is that it was a
little bit fluffier because it's not as
fluffy and because it's just a little
bit flatter it is a little bit more
difficult to blend out colors in your
crease but if it was just a little bit
fluffier I think it would be like crazy
crazy amazing it's just that perfect
brush to deepen out the outer corners of
the eye and I think anybody can use this
brush and benefit from it okay guys so
that was my review on two products that
elf recently came out with I love doing
reviews on more affordable brands like
elf which is why I made this video so I
hope it helped somebody in some way and
