a reveal slash demo lip swatches kind of
thing on the new elf liquid matte
lipsticks and their new plumping lip
glosses as well ask you guys if you want
to see a review and lip swatches on
these products and as some of you guys
said yes so I thought I would just mash
them into one video because they only
released five rich well heads and five
liquid lipsticks so it's not too bad
elf never really releases like a huge
range of products it's always like a few
shades so I don't know if they're going
to expand in the future but for today's
video I'm actually doing this a little
bit different usually when I do lip
swatches I have already tried the
product at least for a day so I give you
guys kind of like a mini review but in
today's video it's more of a first
impressions think I tried out one of the
liquid lipsticks but I honestly don't
even remember I haven't filmed a video
in like two weeks
by the way I'm back quick update before
we get into the video for those of you
who care I know some of you don't but I
was in LA for a full week it was the
longest week of my life there was so
much going on so much my nails look so
crazy by the way I know I got my nails
done and they had little stars like
stuck to my nails and most of them have
fallen off so they're looking really
crusty but it was a crazy long week I'm
so busy these days but I find it hard to
even have some alone time with myself
like I never have a long time with
myself anymore it's insane but I'm so
grateful to be this busy it truly is a
blessing so I'm sorry if this summer
there have been a lactam videos crazy
summer and I have just been working on a
ton of new projects that I can't wait to
share with you guys in the future but
yeah thank you guys for allowing me to
be busy and for just being awesome now
let's jump into this first impression
like I was saying earlier before I
completely interrupted myself I'm going
to do this video a little bit
differently usually I swatch everything
like in one scene a little background
music going on and you see me swatching
all the lip products but today I'm going
to be trying them on one by one here on
camera I'm going to put it on I'm going
to tell you my size I'm going to tell
you how they feel and I'm just going to
give you my review that way since there
are only five liquid lipsticks and five
lip glosses I feel like we won't sit
here forever if there was a lot of
lippies I wouldn't do this but 10 is not
so bad which we can get to 10 all right
so I guess
off with the lip plumping glosses okay
so I zoomed doing a bit and I picked up
my hair because it was driving me nuts
so these are else new lip plumping
glosses they are five dollars each and
I'm in love with their new packaging
this is five dollars but I could totally
see this being priced a little bit
higher I just feel it's plastic but it
feels like a huge step up for elf it
doesn't feel cheap at all I really
really love this packaging and these are
supposed to help plumps the lips with
the nourishing hydration the
invigorating high shine formula provides
a soothing a sensation while it
volumizes
and these have vitamin E and coconut oil
in them which is supposed to help with
dehydration I did try one of these out
like a week and a half ago but I don't
really remember which one but I remember
that it didn't really laugh it was only
on my lips for a few hours but I have
tried lip glosses in the past but just
like disappear in like 30 minutes
this one has a little bit more grip to
it it's a little stickier so I feel like
it sticks around for a little bit longer
but it's not extremely long wearing I
mean what lip gloss is unless it's like
those Mac like lip glasses that last an
eternity because it's literally like the
stickiest lip gloss ever stick here they
are the longer they last so it depends
on what you like I'm going to start off
with the lightest lip gloss and this one
is called champagne glam I love this
color it's such a pretty gloss it has
like a soft Sheen to it it's kind of
like a clear lip gloss it's not really
clear but the base of it is kind of
clear and it has just a ton of little
like tiny reflective golden peach
shimmers but it's not a gritty feeling I
thought it was going to be a little
gritty this one is more of a sheen it
doesn't really have any chunky glitter
to it but I really like this color a lot
and I could already feel it kind of
tingling and I don't really remember it
tingling when I first tried it I feel
like this is perfect to throw on top of
the nude lipsticks I think it is a
little too clear to wear on its own at
least for me because my lips are pretty
pigmented growing up I actually used to
hate that my lips looked a little bit
more red because I was only allowed to
wear a clear lip gloss when I was little
and I hated that my lips looked like
they had like a clear red tint on them
almost so I would love this but on
of a lipstick I do feel a little bit of
a burning sensation like it's very very
slight it's nothing that's too crazy but
I definitely feel it
I definitely feel it if you're extremely
sensitive to lip plumpers you might not
like this but I hate lip plumpers I
don't like them like the Too Faced lip
injections feel like death on the lips
way too aggressive for me but this one
tote I could totally handle this now is
it actually plumping I don't know okay
next up is peach Bellini this one looks
like it's going to be my favorite just
because I love milky really light
glosses like this I know some of them
can wash you out and look a little too
milky but leave that's not the case with
this one and I kit I feel like these are
just pigmented enough like some glosses
that look like this you can apply them
to your lips and it's like nothing is
coming out some are too sheer but if you
like this pigmentation is just right I'm
liking it I'm not huge on lip gloss it's
not my absolute favorite but recently
has been getting more and more into it
and I'm starting to create like a really
strong Loeb affair with lip glosses I
really like this one I like that it
doesn't wash you out too much but it's
just right I like it okay now we have
pink Cosmo I have a feeling this one is
just going to be a little too pink for
me you can kind of see compared to peach
Bellini these are the kind of colors I
prefer over this this one's too like
bubble bony but I mean I might not think
that when I put it on oh I didn't notice
a little shimmer before peach Bellini is
like a complete cream and pink Cosmo has
little tiny shimmers in it which I
actually really like feel like it makes
your lips look a little bit more plump
and a little bit more like juicy and
glossy I will say they'll do not apply
too much of these lip glosses because
they are very thick not like sticky
thick but it has a thick consistency so
you can get like glossy glue penis right
up in your mouth so don't eyes too much
alright so now we have sparkling rose
this one is deeper it's not as new as
the other ones have been
I love it it is a pink gloss but it have
a little bit of moss to it which I feel
makes it more wearable for me personally
I really like this one this one is
perfect to wear it just completely on
its own one you could just throw this in
your purse and it's like the perfect
everyday lipgloss and if it plump your
lips it's like a bonus I think it's nice
that they came out with something like
glasses I mean say whatever I can do to
make my lips look bigger and juicier
without getting lip injections but
there's anything wrong with lip
injections I just personally don't ever
want them so you know if we can fake the
funk I'll go fix this one okay and now
the next one is milk a twist and this is
a very beautiful brownish lip gloss I
love lip colors like this blue this one
is very very pretty I love warm lip
colors and for me it's kind of like a
your lips but better lip gloss I mean it
would be a nice everyday like fall lip
gloss this one is also a complete cream
and it doesn't have any shimmer or
glitter just like sparkling rose doesn't
have a nation rat in it either okay now
let's move on to liquid lipsticks now
forgive me the application of these
might not be the best because I want to
breeze through these I know I can talk a
lot and I don't want anybody to be like
Oh Ryan Ryan channel already so the
first one right here is T rose which
they have a lipstick called T rose like
one of their pencil lipsticks and I
remember it was such a popular shade
back in the day for me it always just
made me look a little dead maybe it's
not exactly the same we shall see the
applicator is different on the liquid
lipsticks versus the lip gloss the lip
gloss has like one of those standard doe
foot applicator just one is a little bit
longer than I'm used to which I do like
for the liquid lipsticks though it has
one of those doe foot applicator that
has like a a hole in the middle kind of
looks like an arrow and yeah I don't
mind these either I'm not super picky
with my applicators
okay so I'm just going to let that sit
for a bit I'm going to see if it dries
down completely I know I already tried
one of these but honestly I don't
remember I have like a little pimple
that's forming on the bottom of my lip
that's lovely
okay now remember I remember I did try
this out and it reminded me of the
colour-pop ultra matte lips these are
even more matte than the colour-pop
liquid lipsticks I don't know if you can
tell but it's kind of dried down to
where you can see every single crack on
my lip
you can probably avoid this by using a
lip balm underneath I'm actually going
to try that with the next liquid
lipstick they feel really comfortable
don't get me wrong they feel extremely
comfortable honestly it feels like I'm
not wearing anything on my lips like it
doesn't feel like anything at all and
look completely transfer to the dry down
to like a powder finish but they just
don't look the prettiest like my lips
look a little wrinkly and old and a way
to take off your liquid lipsticks all
you have to do is apply more liquid
lipstick on top get it all up on your
lips and then take it off immediately
and that takes your like a lipstick
right off my friend is telling me
something that drink so that's fit me
next up we have the color blushing a
rose I feel like I'm going to love this
shade
oh crap
forgot to put on the lip balm the next
one for the next so actually really do
like this applicator I find these liquid
lipsticks extremely easy to apply this
color is a little darker than I thought
it was going to be and these seem like a
pebble liquid lipsticks that get darker
as they dry anyway usually these more
liquidy matte liquid lipsticks tend to
be like that I don't hate the color
though I thought I was going to like it
more than I do but I don't hate the
color but again it is that very matte
finish and you can totally see the lines
in my lips that's a deal-breaker for a
lot of people but if I really love the
color I'll deal with it I have to put a
lip balm for the next one let me take it
out I'll forget the next one is praline
I have a feeling this one it's going to
be my favorite it's just a little warmer
more brownish I'm going to apply some of
the urban decay lip love it has shea
butter coconut oil all that good stuff
I'm going to use this as like a base I'm
not going to write too much oh this
isn't a very thick lip balm though and
you feel like usually work better with
like a sick lip balm something a little
more waxing but let's try it anyway okay
it was definitely really slippy with
that lip balm on no it's like getting on
my teeth I don't think that's the right
lip balm for this but I'm going to wait
for this to dry and see if it makes a
difference okay it's taking a little bit
longer to dry obviously but it is
feeling a little bit more nourishing and
hydrating I think if you want to try
these out but you're really scared of it
being way too dry on you try maybe
aquaphor I think that would be perfect I
has a lip balm underneath it's super
inexpensive you can get it like at
Walgreens and I feel like that would be
a really good base to stimple but I'm
Gracie it's not like a pimple it's like
a little bump that's going to turn into
a pimple it's like I know your
intentions it does transfer those when
you apply lip balm underneath but I did
kiss twice and the color is still there
on my lips it just took some off right
here on the corner but it's not bad and
you can still see the lines on my lips
not but I do think adding a lip balm
helps but you can still see it next up
we have a berry sorbet which is a
stunning berry color it's different than
wine tour wine tour is their deepest
shade berry sorbet you can see has a lot
more pinks to it kinda strange that they
only came out with like two deeper
colors and they're both so similar who
am I to judge okay so I got really
sloppy and lazy with this application
but I am so impressed with this color I
like it so much more than I thought I
was going to like it it's so pigmented
for some reason I thought I was going to
be a little patchy because a lot of the
times these deeper berry colors can tend
to be streaky especially at the
drugstore but oh my gosh this is full
opaque color look at this no patchiness
whatsoever I love this shade so please
be obviously the formula is the same but
I really recommend this one it's so nice
and then last but not least we have wine
tour
okay another application disaster okay
so I really like this one as well this
one is better this one is a little bit
more even this one I can kind of see a
little bit of patchiness but honestly
that happens with like $22 liquid
lipsticks so but okay guys I guess
that's it I'm actually going to wear
this one for the rest of the day and I
will update you on longevity in the
description box yeah I guess I really
don't have to give you a recap since we
discussed all of these colors on the
spot but yeah I'm totally impressed with
these lip glosses
so listen lipsticks through okay they're
not my favorite and I think as I play
around with them a little bit more maybe
I'll figure out how to wear them the
guys that completes this video these
were lip swatches and these were my
thoughts on the new elf lip glosses and
with the lipsticks let me comment down
below let me know what you think of
these have you tried them review them
down below every one is different and I
would love to know your opinion
hey guys that completes this video thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye he's
on my list we need liquid lipstick
remover when you can literally just put
on your liquid lipstick again and as I
go so I guess that's wasting product
isn't it like this you apply it to your
lips and it's layer boy okay so now we
are going into okay so now we your your</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
