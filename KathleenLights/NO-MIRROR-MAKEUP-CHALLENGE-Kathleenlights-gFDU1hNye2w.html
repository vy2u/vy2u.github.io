requested one today we're doing the no
mirror makeup challenge that's why I
have no makeup on my face I'm here with
my friend Melissa you could hear hey hey
my friend Melissa she is gonna be here
because my camera stops recording all
the time so I need someone to look at my
viewfinder but obviously I can't look at
it because I'm not supposed to see my
face so I turned it over feel like I'm
out of breath I'm having wine this is
actually a cup that my friend Melissa
got me for Christmas has a K on it so I
don't have a mirror in front of me at
all I put my mirror in my bathroom
I covered my mirror here with a blanket
turned over my viewfinder well this is
my witness yeah so I'm just gonna do a
makeup like I normally would I'm really
nervous because every video I've seen if
people do this it looks amazing
nikkietutorials look did you see
mickey's yeah she looked exactly like if
she had a mirror in front of her manis
came out really good too I can add to my
makeup without a mirror I don't think I
should have combined alcohol with no
mirror makeup challenge okay so I'm
gonna start off with this this is a
point perk from Sephora Bobby Brown
vitamin-enriched face base 100-point
perk this is actually like 70 books
something crazy I know I know
I already but I already cashed in like
five of these so I got them coming in -
wait oh now here it's really good a lot
of people like this okay so I'm gonna go
in with another primer just because I
really want to test it out even though
can't really see it in the mirror but
this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory Hocus focus
instant visual flaw softening
illuminator so it's like a very
illuminating primer house like pink
reflex in it pink and gold let's just
throw that on my face too
I don't know where to look so I'm just
going to look at you Melissa I'm going
to do my eyebrows because I always do my
eyebrows before my makeup so I'm going
to go in with the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow definer in soft brown sleep
you know brush them oh my god this is
the worst idea I've ever had oh my god I
really this is impossible
how is calling this a nice soup all
right don't make faces I'm sucking don't
make pieces
spray-tan like just reach under come up
with a mirror
that's as good as it's gonna get
I always do like a feathery brow it's
like my new thing that I've been doing
so I must do it this is the Loreal brow
stylist plumper I like to go like this
and then I go I lift them up I have a
tutorial on my channel actually probably
better than this that I'm showing you
right now yeah so I always lift them up
and then I don't like them to look too
crazy because they're long so I just
like brush them down a little bit yeah
that's pretty much as good as it's gonna
get all right I'm gonna do my face
makeup first and then my eyes I'm gonna
be using at the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer my
shade finally came in to Sephora I am in
the shade linen and I'm going to use the
new Beauty Blender this is the beauty
blusher this is a dry Beauty Blender and
this is a wet Beauty blusher so it's
pretty much like the size of a dry
Beauty Blender but I actually really
like it because it gets underneath my
eyes I know it's super gimmicky have you
seen this it's a blush I know it's like
really gimmicky and stuff but I feel
like it gets I mean it take a little bit
longer for me to do my foundation I'm
not gonna lie but uh like it gets
underneath my eyes perfectly okay so I'm
just gonna dot this on my face this is
why I chose this foundation I feel like
it's easier I'm going to just paint it
make sense
yeah right hello all right
poly just asked for this part I'll be
bouncing here for a while tell me sorry
okay see ya a little bit takes a little
longer but I I don't know what parts of
heaven blended okay yeah I got a spot
there I'm gonna go in with concealer I'm
going to use the Maybelline fit me in
the shade 15 fair all right I'm just
gonna draw like that
I'm just going to draw this on my face
I'm going to highlight here and I'm
actually really really trying guys I
know that some people might look at this
video we like while she's doing that on
purpose I'm not this is actually me
drying I guess I'm on my leak this
videos gonna be seven hours I can
already feel it blending that out and
look how easily it just gets right under
my I really like it I'm bringing this
onto my lid to prime my eyelid
okay so I'm done with that now I'm going
to powder my face I'm gonna use my it
cosmetics my by pores powder this powder
is amazing I feel like you would love
this powder good well I guess you don't
watch my videos cuz I haven't stopped
talking about it
you
setting my under eye concealer with this
and I'm also gonna set the rest of my
face with this pretty much might as well
I'm ready here okay so now I'm going to
bronze my skin actually in today's video
I'm going to be using products that are
pretty new these are the new two-faced
products that are coming out for spring
so I'm going to bronze my face with the
Too Faced sweetheart bronzer in the
shade sweet tea all of this stuff comes
out March 17th I know that it's not out
yet but the Too Faced sweet peach
palette comes out March 17th and this
bronzer and this new blush that I'm
gonna be using today comes out March
17th so I'm going to dip into this bad
boy right here I love this bronzer I
tried it yesterday for the first time
this is a zoeva 90 brush not going to
contour she's gonna bronze today
you
okay so I just finished bronzy on my
skin don't remember how pigmented this
bronzer was and I put it on yesterday so
I'm a little scared now I'm going to add
some blush I'm going to use the new Too
Faced sweethearts blush in sparkling
Bellini she's so pretty and I was scared
when I first got it like that's going to
be way too dark for me but it actually
comes off a little bit lighter so I'm
going to use my little Sigma f15 brush
and I'm just going to dust that on tap
it off girl
this is no expression mother this is
looking at me with no expression I'm
telling a little backstory of Melissa so
