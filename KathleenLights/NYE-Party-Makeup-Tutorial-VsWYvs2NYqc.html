tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it is very dramatic for me but it
should be it is a New Year's Eve makeup
tutorial and whenever I think of New
Year's Eve I think a really dramatic
makeup it is mainly using the Gwen
Stefani palette by urban decay I use
mainly these shadows but I did use this
bad boy here this is probably the star
of the show this is the color pop
eyeshadow in the shade telepathy it's
the color I have all over my eyelids
this of course is the eyeshadow I
created with the wear the night is quad
which this quad is available to purchase
right now this is my newest collab with
color pop and I will link this down
below I will link where you can purchase
this little quad down below so I know
that some people might not like this
because it is like a very harsh kind of
eyelid it's not too blended but I really
like that for New Year's Eve I think
it's different and it's fun so yes I
hope you guys enjoy and if you want to
see how to get this makeup look then
just keep watching ok so I've already
applied my eyeshadow primer and I've
applied some tape to the sides of my
eyes to create a sharper look I'm going
into the Gwen Stefani palette but with
urban decay and I'm taking the shade
Anaheim and I'm using this as my
transition shade I'm applying this into
my crease so that all of the other
eyeshadows can blend a lot easier going
into this street called zone it's a
little bit warmer and deeper than
Anaheim I'm going to take the exact same
brush this is a Sephora Pro crease brush
probably my favorite to crease brush of
all time
and I'm applying this really really
close to the tape and then dragging it
into the crease that is the main
technique I will be doing throughout
this whole video I'm gonna take the red
shade in the palette it's like a really
dark red it's my favorite shade in this
palette and I'm taking as a wave a brush
that looks pretty much identical to the
Mac 217 and I'm going to start applying
this eyeshadow directly like on the tape
and then dragging it in the same way I
did with the crease brush and then I'm
going to take a black out and apply this
again really really really close to the
tape and then dragging in I want like a
gradient effect from the tape to the
inner corners
now I'm going to take the colour-pop
super shock shadow in telepathy and I'm
going to start taking it on my finger
I'm applying this pretty much everywhere
there isn't the black eye shadow and
then I went in with a synthetic brush to
be a little bit more precise and I went
in with the same zoeva brush and I'm
starting to blend these colors together
I did want like a cool harsh line which
it is what ended up happening but I
wanted to make sure that it didn't look
too harsh that everything was just a
little bit more blended I went into the
shade blondie or blonde I'm not exactly
sure and I use this to highlight my brow
bone then I went into this really really
pretty gold it has a little bit of green
to it so it pairs perfectly with
telepathy and I use that to apply to my
inner corners and then I am priming my
face with the Becca backlight primer I
love it
then I took my Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless foundation can I speak
today my foundation fit me matte and
poreless and I'm applying that to my
entire face I really really really love
this foundation and I'm using a Sephora
Pro airbrush to blend that in and then I
got this concealer on Amazon when I was
like shopping for some UK makeup and
this is the Rimmel wake me up concealer
so I'm just applying this underneath my
eyes and other places I would highlight
this is the first time I used it and I
actually really really like it I think
it's very similar to the Maybelline
better skin and the Maybelline fit me oh
yeah I was watching a really emotional
episode of the flash so I was like
crying and really really trying not to
mess up my makeup but anyway I just
blended that in like you've seen me do a
million times and to set that I am using
my NYC translucent setting powder I just
got this to test it out and I really
liked it it didn't look cakey underneath
my eyes which I usually have that
problem okay so back to the eyes before
I finish my face I'm going to take zone
again but I'm taking it on a pencil
brush and I'm applying this all the way
on my lower lash line from outer corner
to inner corner and I'm taking my Holy
Grail black eye liner and I'm applying
this to my waterline and this is the NYX
gel black eyeliner and I'm applying this
to my tight line as well but not all the
way in
so I'm taking black out and I'm only
gonna apply this shadow on the outer
corners of my eye I want the inner
corners to be nice and bright and like
greeny gold I'm going back into that
gold and I'm applying this in my inner
corners again just to intensify them a
little bit and then I'm applying it a
little bit on my lower lash line then
I'm going back into telepathy and I'm
applying this on the inner part of my
lower lash line just so that it can
match with the top part of my lid so I'm
going in with some falsies and these are
the velour silk lashes that they made
with Sephora they're not mink they are
silk and um they're pretty good I like
them so I'm going to contour my face
using the morphe and the contour palette
and I'm going to contour my face with
the shade I pointed at so I'm just
contouring like I usually do warming up
the skin you know
and now I want to brighten up my
undereyes so I'm taking this really
light shade in the palette and on my
Real Techniques setting brush I'm just
applying this underneath my eyes to
really brighten up the look and I'm not
really into this whole baking trend I
don't I don't really do it at all but I
think for New Year's Eve for like a
special occasion it it does look really
nice so I'm just doing that underneath
my contour to make my contour a little
bit more visible and then I'm just
brushing it away a couple minutes later
and it really does help make your
contour look nice and sharp
so for a blush I'm taking my favorite
blush of all-time it just goes with
everything this is NARS madly blush it's
my all-time favorite and I'm just
applying this onto my cheeks and then
I'm going in with highlights this is the
NYX illuminator in the shade ritualistic
and I like it but it takes a lot of
building up it's kind of like a stiffer
formula so it's not really intense it's
not bad it's just um I really have to
build up for the color to show and I'm
going to go in with this too for a
collection lipliner in the shade nudist
but it was a little bit too purple for
me so I wanted something a little bit
peachy er so I took the Kat Von D liquid
lipstick in Noble and I applied it on
top and then that completes this look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
