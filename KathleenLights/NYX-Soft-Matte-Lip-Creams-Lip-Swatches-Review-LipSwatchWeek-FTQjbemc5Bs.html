you
to the blue
hey guys welcome back to lips watch week
that annoy me just as much as it annoyed
you I have a special guest Porter in a
Christmas sweater oh he is so cold
because um when the puppet is so so so
sweet because it's freezing outside so I
put on this Christmas sweater on him
anyway these lip swatches were featuring
the NYX soft matte lip creams and I
wanted to include these in lip swatch
week because a while ago I asked you
guys like hey do you guys know any
drugstore dupes for like liquid
lipsticks and a lot of you guys told me
to check these out and I already had
like five in my collection and then I
just bought like a few more just so that
I can include in lip swatch week that
sounds sad but I wanted to give you guys
some swatches of a lot of them and I
purchased them online and when I got
them in the mail I was like wow a lot of
these look really similar and they do a
lot are very similar but I love neutral
shades that is one thing I'm going to
say with the NYX soft matte lip creams
they hit it on the nail with neutral
colors a lot of the liquid lipsticks are
like you know matte lip colors like that
don't have neutral shades they're
usually very bold and maybe one or two
like nudes or neutral colors these soft
matte lip creams they have a ton of
neutral shades which I love so much so
that seriously it's like an a-plus-plus
from me but I will say that I don't
think they are dupes for liquid
lipsticks I don't think they are liquid
lipsticks I am like a lipstick liquid a
lipstick connoisseur I guess and I love
them Lime Crime girl lactic Stila I love
them and these are more like just a
creamy matte lipstick in my opinion like
they go on kind of like a lip gloss
because it's in like that kind of
applicator but even though they do dry
down super matte eye they're more creamy
to me they don't have like that liquidy
feel to them if that makes sense so I
don't think they're that similar also
they don't last as long as like
I'm crime velvetine or sila all day
liquid lipsticks they don't last that
long I do have to take it with me on the
go and then reapply throughout the day
but it doesn't fade ugly like it fades
really nicely and I mean you can get a
good decent amount of wear time but you
are gonna have to reapply probably more
so than like a Stila all day liquid lips
I know that this week features a lot of
liquid lipsticks like tomorrow is the i
will be swatching the Too Faced melted
lipsticks but that's what's my thing
right now and if you guys want lip
swatch week again I already mentioned
this but if you guys want lip swatch
week again maybe in like two months
I won't feature liquid lipsticks it'll
be like different lip products so yeah
besides that I really love these the one
thing I will say though that I don't
love that I have to apply this like in
three layers I have to put it on wait
for it to dry put on another layer wafer
to dry and then put on the another layer
to get that full opacity because there
you know it's a little bit panchi
sometimes Morocco and Prague Prague
Prague I'm messing up
those aren't patchy at all but the other
ones I feel like I do have to like to
get that OH color but besides that these
are super inexpensive and probably one
of the best matte lipsticks at the
drugstore matte you know at the
drugstore I love them they're really
good and very cheap just those little
things that I don't love but I could
totally look past them because they like
7ls so yeah that completes this video
today I hope you guys enjoyed it
tomorrow will be the last day and lip
swatch week it's bittersweet don't
forget to tell me on Twitter how you
think lip swatch week is going with the
