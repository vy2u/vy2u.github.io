wearing right now it is using the Urban
Decay Naked 2 palette and I really
wanted to film this kind of tutorial
because I usually wear like Browns and
gold's as opposed to blacks and Silver's
so I kind of wanted to branch out and do
something different and I rarely use my
Naked 2 palette since it's a little bit
more cool toned so I wanted to bring
this puppy out and do something for the
cool-toned lovers out there and I'm
actually really liking how it turned out
I don't know I just I really really love
it so if you want to see how I got this
look then just keep on watching okay so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to prime my eyelids with Mac's
painterly paint-pot
for that really sharp cat I look like
the really sharp edges I'm going to take
some tape and put it on the back of my
hand a few times just so that it doesn't
pull at the skin around my eyes
now I'm going in with Urban Decay's
naked 2 palette and I'm going to be
taking the color tees and with the Sigma
e-40 I am going to work that into my
crease I'm just going to be using this
as a transition color so all the other
colors blend nicely
next I'm going in with the color pistol
which is this color right here and I'm
taking it on a Mac 239 brush and I'm
going to pack this color on my entire
lid
okay so because I want this color to
really stand out I'm going to take mac's
fix+ and spray that on my brush and
adding fix+ to any eyeshadow really
intensifies the color a lot so I'm just
going to pack this on my lid again
so you can really see what a difference
the fix+ makes on the eyeshadow now I'm
going in with the color black out and
I'm just going to work this on the outer
part of my eye and a little bit in the
crease this part takes a lot of time
it's just really going back and forth
with that same color and just working it
in lightly because black out is a very
very pigmented black eyeshadow so going
back and forth and adding that shadow
little by little kind of helps you blend
it out a lot more as opposed to just
dipping your brush into the eyeshadow
and putting it on your eye you're going
to have like a big black spot because
it's so pigmented so just take your time
with it and go back and forth and just
work it into the crease and into the
outer corners as well
okay now I'm going to take this brush
right here it's from Coastal Scents it's
just an eyeshadow brush but it's really
soft so I like using it for this and I'm
just going to be dipping it back into
that same black out color and really
packing on the color on the outer
corners and blending it towards the
center of my eye so this part is just
really a lot a lot of blending you just
want to take the color and mostly focus
it on the outer part of your eye like
where the tape meets the eye shadow and
just blend it towards the center
like I said it's just a lot of blending
just pack the color out on the outer
corner and start blending it in this
part is completely up to you if you want
it really really intense black on the
outer corners or if you don't want it so
intense so whatever is comfortable for
you
you
now I'm taking the color foxy and I'm
adding this as my highlight under my
brow bone
this color foxy is pretty much the color
of my skin so I'm going to be taking a
little bit of booty call it's like very
shimmery so I'm only taking a little bit
of it and adding it to like the high
point underneath my eyebrow like
underneath the arch
now I'm taking my favorite eyeliner it
is the Maybelline master drama eyeliner
and i'm going to tightline with this and
also be adding this to my waterline okay
now for the liquid liner I'm using my
Maybelline Line stiletto and just adding
some liquid liner
okay I really want the liquid liner to
be as mad as possible and the line
stiletto can kind of leave it a little
bit glossy so I'm going to take black
out and just kind of set the liquid
liner with the black eyeshadow and it
makes it look very matte which is what I
want
now I'm just taking off the tape and you
have this perfectly straight sharp cat I
kind of look I love it and I'm just
taking my little makeup remover and kind
of like cleaning around any fallout yada
yada yada you know you know
okay and here I'm just doing the face
makeup I didn't really go into detail
with this I always do so I wanted to
keep it short for this video but of
course I will be listing all the things
I used on my face on in the description
box but I'm just using some foundation
and concealer and all that stuff I just
really wanted to put my foundation on
before I finished my eyes because I am
not done with my eye makeup
if you're wondering see back to the eyes
okay I added some more eyeliner by the
way because I felt like it had kind of
faded okay so anyway I am taking the
brush that came with the Naked 2 palette
and I'm taking the color verb which is a
very light shimmery silver and I'm going
to pack this on the inner part of my eye
so I want my eye to go from like a light
silver to a dark silver to black so
that's why I'm packing it on the inner
part of my eye and I'm also putting this
in my tear duct area as my highlight
okay so now I'm taking a pencil brush
and I'm dipping it into that same Verve
color and I'm going to put this all over
my lower lash line I personally think it
looks nice it kind of brightens up the
lower lash line even though I have like
really intense black eyeliner I don't
know I just think it kind of brightens
up the look a little bit and I
personally think it looks nice but I
mean if you want to go darker on the
lower lash line you totally can and it
would still look really really nice it
is up to you so now I'm just going to
take my Clinique lash doubling mascara
and add mascara to my top and bottom
lashes
and voila these are the finished eyes
okay so I already did the rest of my
face makeup just to save some time I
don't want this video to be too long but
I contoured with my ELF contouring blush
and bronzing powder thing just concert
with the bronzer and for my blush I used
the NYX blush and mauve I have been
loving this you guys know that if you
saw my favorites video it's just like my
favorite blush at the moment and I
highlighted with an eyeshadow in my
Stila in the light palette i highlighted
with kitten it's just like that
highlight I have going on here I have
been loving to highlight my cheeks with
this kit in eye shadow it's beautiful
umm yeah I love it anyway I still need
to put on some lipstick I'm first gonna
take Viva Glam Gaga from Mac mine is all
busted and gross so I'm gonna take it on
a little lip brush like this
I'm putting it on very very lightly I
don't want it to be like bubblegum pink
just like a light wash of a baby pink
color and then on top of that I am
taking my NYX butter gloss and creme
brulee I have been obsessed with this
it's beautiful so that's what I'm going
to layer on top
okay guys so that is the finished look I
really hope you liked this tutorial and
I hope you try it out on yourself thank
you so much for watching guys please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye I
don't want to put on too much I don't
want it to be like crazy
