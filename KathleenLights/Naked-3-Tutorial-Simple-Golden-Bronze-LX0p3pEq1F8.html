on the makeup I'm wearing it is another
naked 3 tutorial am i doing to any of
these maybe but in my defense this was
requested this is the look I am wearing
in my previous video the February
favorites video and a bunch of you guys
said you wanted to see a tutorial on it
so here I am what I like so much about
this look is that it's literally so easy
there's no wing no eyeliner nothing too
dramatic it is a nice simple bronzy look
and I love that because the Naked 3
palette is full of nice rosy pinky color
so you wouldn't think of doing a look so
warm and chocolatey and bronzy but you
can now obviously there are some rosy
undertones and mists look like you could
definitely see the pinks kind of popping
through but that's because you know it's
a pink palette but if you've been
wanting to do a nice bronzy look with
the Naked 3 I hope you enjoyed this one
so if you want to see how to get this
look just keep watching okay so to prime
my eyes I am using the Urban Decay
primer potion then I'm going to be
taking the Milani shadow eyes in the
shade golden bronze and I'm going to use
this as a base for the eyeshadows I'm
using and then I'm just going to blend
that out with my finger keeping it below
my crease
so I'm going to take my naked 3 palette
and I'm going to go into the shade
nooner and I'm going to use this in my
crease with a Mac 217 just to blend out
that base we just put down
I'm going to build the color slowly and
take it a little bit far past my crease
then I'm going to go into the color
trick and I'm going to use my mac fix+
just intensify this eyeshadow a little
bit more and then I'm going to apply
this all over my lid right up to the
crease the next color I'm using is this
one called Factory and I'm using this
one because it does have a lot of Brown
to it so it's really going to compliment
that gold color and I'm just going to
take this on my 217 and slightly blend
it into my crease while putting it on my
outer V as well I'm also going to be
taking a smaller flat shader brush this
one's from Coastal Scents and I'm just
going to be packing that same color onto
my outer V and then bringing it into my
crease and I'm using this brush to just
get a little bit more precise than the
217 going back into my 217 with no
additional product and just going to
blend everything into my crease now with
a tiny little brush I'm going to take
the color Blackheart and I'm just going
to add this really close to my lashes
but on the outer V of my eye so right in
the middle I'm just going to drag it all
the way to the end and this is going to
make like an imaginary eyeliner look but
it's not going to be as harsh then I'm
just going to highlight with the color
strange and I'm going to use that under
my brow bone and in my tear duct as well
for my mascara I am using the Jordana
best lash Xtreme I'm going to go onto
the rest of my face before I finish up
underneath my eyes so I'm going to prime
my face with the L'Oreal miracle blur
and I'm only going to add this to places
where I think I need it I'm not going to
put this all over my face since it is
pretty thick
the foundation I'm using is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation in 250
medium beige and I'm going to use my
Real Techniques sponge to apply it this
is a pretty thick foundation so I like
using a sponge to apply it since it
thins it out and gives it a little bit
more of a dewy finish
then I'm going to take my Maybelline
instant age rewind dark circle eraser
and I'm going to highlight my face and
cover my dark circles
then I'm going to take my Real
Techniques contour brush to blend all
that out
to set that area underneath my eyes I'm
using the fit me powder in 1/35 creamy
natural
underneath my eyes I'm going to take a
tiny little brush and I'm going to dip
it into the color factory and I'm just
going to run this underneath my lashes I
didn't use eyeliner or anything like
that you can go ahead and do that if you
want it to be a little bit more dramatic
but I liked the way it looked without
eyeliner then I'm going to take my
little Clinique bottom lash mascara and
I'm going to apply this to my bottom
lashes now I'm just going to bronze up
my face a little bit and I'm going to
use the NYC Sun and bronze in the shade
Montauk bronze with my Real Techniques
blush brush and I'm just going to pretty
much throw this all over my face
for my blush I am using the Tarte
Amazonian clay blush in the color
exposed with my it cosmetics blush brush
now I'm just gonna highlight a little
bit and I'm going to use the hard candy
bronzer and Tiki and I'm just gonna
highlight my cheekbones down the bridge
of my nose and a little bit above my lip
for lipstick I'm using this extremely
white lipstick from Maybelline called
bare at all no it's called bare all I'm
pretty sure yeah and it is way too white
for me so I just like to dab a little
bit on my lips to make them more nude to
top it off I'm going to use the buxom
lipgloss in white Russian and then that
completes this makeup tutorial thank you

will see you in my next one bye
