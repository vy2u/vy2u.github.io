a comparison video we are going to be
watching both of these pallets
side-by-side and we are going to discuss
them we're going to chat about them
we're going to have a swatch party is
going to be fun which is going to sit
back relax and talk about the crazy
similarities between these two pallets
and whether I think this is a dupe for
this or not so this is the natasha's
anona
sunset palette when this first came out
and I saw the colors that were in this
palette I almost fainted I knew I needed
it right away and I know a ton of
companies are coming out with pallets
like this like in this color family but
I found this one to be so unique because
it had that pop of red and that pop of
yellow and those other terracotta shades
I thought this was gorgeous and then
color pop released this little guy right
here this is the yes please palette even
though it says cute F on the front it's
called the yes place palette and when
you open it it looks really really
really similar to the sunset palette you
can see when I hold them up side by side
obviously this palette has more
eyeshadows but they look really really
familiar and not only did I notice that
but so many of you guys noticed that as
well I was getting messages tweets
comments from you guys telling me to do
an entire video about this to watch the
colors side by side to see if they are
similar to see if they are dupes and
just to give you my review in my opinion
so that is what we are doing today so
who the Natasha's annona palette retails
for one hundred and twenty nine dollars
while the color pop yes police palette
retails for sixteen buckaroos that is
over $100 of a price difference the
phonemic Gracie and obviously these both
have completely different packaging so
the price will vary of course between
these two palettes but you know let's
just dive in let's talk about this guy
because I feel like this is so highly
raved about I'm not sure when this will
come back in stock if it even is going
to come back in stock because this is a
limited-edition palette so I don't know
if it's sold out and then the fit you
know it's gone forever
this one was sold out I think up until
today I'm pretty sure the day that I'm
posting this video like if you're
watching this when I post this I'm
pretty sure this comes back and stuck
today which is awesome because if you do
think it's worth it to buy this and you
really really been wanting this this is
sold out and this is currently back in
stock well I don't know if when you're
watching this if it already sold out
again but if you have been interested in
this anyway pause this video and go buy
it because back in stock this is the
packaging of the sunset palette I know a
lot of people hate the natascha than on
a packaging but I kind of like it
especially for this one I like the gold
I feel like it is sturdy and it does
feel a little bit pricier it doesn't
feel luxury but it is I mean I like it
the only thing I don't like is stupid
little flap on the inside so when you
open it it does come with a mirror that
is a major plus in my opinion because
you can look in the mirror and do your
makeup the color palette does not have a
mirror just don't like the cola flap
thing I mean I know it's there to
protect the eyeshadows and you also have
the names of the shadows on this little
thing but I feel like this cheapens the
product a little bit I see this and I
don't think 129 dollars you know it's
fine besides that I do like this
packaging so you get 15 I shadow in the
Natasha's and on a pallet while in the
color Cup 1 you only get 12 so you get
three more eyeshadows in this guy which
is good considering it is more money
honestly I've said this before in the
past but Natasha do Donna has some of
the best eyeshadows I've ever used in my
life if not the best eyeshadows I've
ever used in my life they're super
pricey but I think they're worth it some
of them have a lot of Fallout I don't
love her glittery shades all that much
unless I use a glitter glue or fix+
using them on their own like what's just
a primer doesn't do it for me her max
they're so creamy her maps are amazing
her statins are even creamier I love I
love her formula and when you break it
down and do the math each of these
eyeshadows cost like about eight dollars
which technically isn't that bad for a
single eyeshadow especially a Natasha
Venona one but I can totally understand
someone not wanting to spend a hundred
and thirty dollars on an eyeshadow
palette that's crazy but maybe you look
at this and you're like man I really
love those colors I just don't want to
spend that money and let me introduce
you please please honestly this is a
different palette in terms of formula
packaging everything but it's such a
huge price difference that if you are on
a budget or you just don't like spending
a lot of money
make up I say go for this if you've been
wanting this straight off the bat I say
go for it because you can definitely get
really similar looks with both of them
I have mainly this palette on this eye
and main leave this palette on this eye
I did use both pallets on both eyes I'm
not going to lie because some of these
are not exact color dupes so I have to
go back and dip into both palettes to
kind of get them to look exactly the
same and I really really like it so this
one is much smaller obviously it comes
in this cardboard packaging and even
though it is cardboard I think it feels
really nice like I like it almost feels
like soft touch and velvety here on the
inside I love the cover I love what it
says
I like how you get the names of the
eyeshadows on the back of the palette I
don't like that there is no mirror but
again it's $16 for the price I actually
love this packaging it's very travel
friendly you just throw this in your
purse it's magnetic I love it especially
for color pop like this is such a big
step for color pop considering they just
started off with those super shock
shadows so the packaging gets an a-plus
for me and when you break down the price
of this it's pretty awesome because you
get 12 I shadow then it's $16 which i
think is really nice now I will say you
do get more products in this which is
also why it's more expensive like on the
back it says 2.5 grams / 0.08 ounces and
then this one is 0.85 grams / 0.03
ounces this has more eyeshadows
obviously but besides that you do get
more product in each individual
eyeshadow with this guy for example this
is the size of a regular single shadow
but from colour-pop and you can see
compared to the eyeshadows in the
palette they are slightly smaller which
is why it is a little bit cheaper but I
don't think it's that much of a
difference and I totally think it's
worth it anyway because the price is
right
how often do you go through a single
shadow anyway alright so obviously all
those things I just mentioned make a
huge difference when it comes to the
price of the product but let's talk
about what you guys are actually here
for I'm going to go through all the
eyeshadows in the Natasha Venona palette
that are in the color pop palette as
well because all of these eyeshadows
except for two of them are in this
palette they're not exactly the same but
they're very very similar shades so
to begin all right so I'm just going to
go down the road and I'll show you
swatches on my arm I did put on
eyeshadow primer on my arm when I did
swatches and I know that people do brush
swatches and finger swatches now I know
that's the new thing but since I'm just
showing you color comparisons I'm just
doing finger swatches so the first color
right here is called atmosphere and it
is a really really gorgeous
pinky shimmery brown the closest color
in the color pop palette is the last one
in the first row they look very very
similar the only difference is the color
pop one is a little bit more red toned
versus the natasha's oh no no one which
is a little bit more pinky have a little
bit more of a brown undertone they both
have amazing pigmentation and they're
both easy to work with so even though
they aren't exactly the same I think
they are similar enough the next color
in the palette is called sinai' and it
is a really beautiful warm brown and it
is very similar to the shade called
Louie in the color pop palette they're
not exact dupes though the Natasha's oh
no no one is a little less red and just
a little bit deeper but they are very
similar in this case I do really really
prefer that Natasha's Inanna ones
because the formula of this like satin
color is so beautiful it's not a full-on
matte versus the color pop I feel like
that one is a little bit more matte this
one has a little bit more of a
creaminess to it which helps it blend a
little bit better the next shade is
called icicles this one is not in the
color pop palette so we're just going to
skip it
this one is called Mandarin and it is a
stunning oranjee yellow gold it is
absolutely gorgeous I love this color
so much one of my favorites and this one
looks really similar to chauffeur in the
color pop palette the only difference is
the color pop one is a little deeper
then etosha the not own one is slightly
more shimmery and more golden but they
are very similar this next one is called
bronze which it's one of my favorite
colors in this palette and it is not a
color that's in the color pop one so
let's move right along this one is
called volcano and it's a really pretty
deep matte Brown and it is the closest
one to the shade french-kiss in the
color pop palette now these are pretty
different
especially swatch side-by-side the color
pop one is definitely a little bit more
red tone but surprisingly I like
colour-pop one better I don't know if
it's the undertone or the way that it
was blending but when I was applying the
colour-pop shade to my left eye I just
liked how it looked better than the
natasha's anona one so I ended up going
over the right eye with the color pop
color anyway I just thought the
undertone was prettier so this next one
also isn't there it is a gorgeous color
but it also isn't there this orange one
is called horizon and I love this color
on my lower lashline it is so nice in
the summertime and this one looks very
very similar to the orange and the color
pop one called
big cocktails then a top of the no.1 is
a little bit more muted the color pop
one is a bit deeper a little brighter
and actually comes off a little bit more
pigmented on first watch then a toss
with another one you do have to build it
up a little bit more but that's what I
love about this shade it's very
buildable and blendable and it's so
creamy so I definitely like the
nataschab - no no one more but they're
both very very similar and I think
totally dupes for one another
this next shade is called Sundays it's a
really pretty glittery gold but it does
have a lot of Fallout so you do have to
be careful with this shade and it does
look really similar to the gold in the
color pop palette called butter cake but
the color pop one isn't as pigmented as
a natasha's that on a one it's just a
little bit chunkier I mean it's natasha
Sedona
she has amazingly foiled metallic shades
so this one is definitely better than
the color pop one but in terms of color
you definitely can build up the color
pop one add a little bit of six plus and
you can get a similar look we're going
to skip this color because it's not in
the color pop palette this pale pink is
called granita I'm actually wearing this
like in the inner corners of my eyes
today it's one of those soft wash of
colors that will help you like blend
other looks I don't know I really like
this shade and it looks similar to the
color pop champ they're not total dupes
the color pop one is peachy er than the
other one but on the eyes they do look
really really similar and they're both
really creamy and easy to use I really
love both of those shades okay so this
shade Morgana Morgana this is like a
star of the palette for me it is such a
beautiful fiery orange II golden ray I
don't know it's gorgeous I love the
shade and color pop Louie is as close as
you're going to get to this these are
pretty off the natasha's the no one
definitely has more of that orange e
fiery golden undertone versus Louie
Louie is a little bit more red but it
does have that golden shift which makes
them very similar on the eyes they don't
look that similar you can totally see a
difference but I mean they are pretty
close they are pretty close then the
posture one is just so oiled and out of
this world but again for the price it's
just colorful is just too good I don't
know they're both awesome next up we
have this delicious red tangent feel
like I'm not pronouncing any of these
names right this one has such a buttery
blendable formula it's incredible I love
it and it looks pretty similar to the
shade spoiled in the color pop palette
the color pop is a little bit more
reddish orange versus the Natasha's
another one that's a little bit more
reddish pink you can't really see the
difference until you start blending them
out on the eyes but the undertone is
just slightly different but I still
think you can get a similar look with
both of the shades this shade is one of
my favorites in this palette and I'm so
sad to see that it's not a dupe in the
color pop one I mean this one is good
enough don't get me wrong like this dark
brown that's good enough for me but this
one is just like super dark I love it
but it's not in the palette so let's
move on to the very last shade which is
this bright canary yellow this one is
called soul and it is very similar to
the yellow in the color pop one this one
is called mischief and they're both so
good I actually love both of these
yellows equally which I thought I was
going to like the Natasha to normal one
more but I love the color pop one a lot
I'm wearing the color pop yellow in my
left crease and me Natasha yellow in my
right crease and they both performed
exactly the same the color pop one is
slightly more yellow like it's a little
bit louder
but both so good and so incredibly
similar like I can barely tell the
difference alright so we went through
every single color in the Natasha's
Venona palette and pretty much all of
these colors are in this palette except
two of them and I'm going to show you
swatches of the two shades that are in
this palette they're not in this one and
these five shades that are in this one
and not in this one okay so on the left
side we have B five shades in the
Tasha Sedona palette that the color pop
palette is lacking I love all of these
shades except the white one they're
gorgeous but on the right side we have
the two color pop shades that aren't in
the Natasha de Nona palette and I find
those two to be colors that I wear every
time I pick up the color pop palette so
for me those who are essentials and I'm
glad they're in that palette okay so
obviously you get more eyeshadows in
this palette so you get more of a
variety it gives you two extra all over
the lid shimmer shades that are
absolutely gorgeous by the way like
these two colors that are not in the
color club one are exceptional it's like
totally amazing and then you get
different matte Browns that are not in
the color club one which are also very
very useful but this white shimmery
shade I find no use for I use it today
and my inner corners just just like you
know put a little something in there but
I love that they added a crease shade
that isn't in the natascha of the nono
one and they add a matte highlighting
shade that isn't in the Natasha's I
don't know one either because when I
look at this palette the only color that
I can really just throw in my crease
that's going to work is this orange one
or this yellow one and neither of them
are very wearable to begin with this one
on the other hand they added note to
self to this palette which makes it a
little bit more wearable and I love
putting this one in my crease it's what
I did today and I just love that this
palette has that and I also love that it
has this matte highlighting shade
because I use that today to highlight
underneath my brow bone and this palette
doesn't have that for me either this one
has more shades that can come up with
more looks but I just feel like this one
is a little bit more wearable and more
practical I mean well this one is
wearable too because you do have those
bronze colors and those Browns I don't
know I love them both if you have been
wanting this but it's out of your budget
I say pick this up because it is really
really good I actually see myself using
this one a lot more than the cost of the
nono one I'm not even kidding I'm not
just saying that cuz I absolutely love
coat off because I have nothing to gain
from this video regardless this is not
sponsored this is just my opinion I
think they're both really great this one
is better in terms of quality and one's
ability and creaminess but it is pricier
so you get what you pay for in this case
this one it's currently out of stock and
I think for the meantime you know what
you should just pick this one up instead
because it is
good yeah guys I hope you enjoyed this
video I hope my opinion helps you make a
decision I thought it was fun just sit
down compare colors and talk about these
pallets let me know what your thoughts
are on both of these pallets in the
comments below
but that completes this video guys thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
what do you mean they are different in
terms of four forms and it looks really
really similar to color colorful blonde
and lossy and salute because I have
played with because I have because I've
already because I've already horror I
