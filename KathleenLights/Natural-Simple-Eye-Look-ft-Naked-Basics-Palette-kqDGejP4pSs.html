and fast I makeup tutorial for you guys
and it's using my Urban Decay Naked
basics palette my amazing palette I love
this thing and you can do so many looks
for this and the last time I use this in
my video it was a really dark and
dramatic black smokey eye so I decided
to show you my favorite simple you know
makeup when I use this thing that makes
sense
my favorite everyday simple makeup using
this palette there you go
that makes more sense this is one of the
makeup looks that I go for when I don't
know what I'm going to wear yet and I
know that it'll still look good with
whatever I wear it's quick simple and
easy and I think that everyone would
like this look on themselves so yeah I
hope you enjoy it and I'm just going to
go ahead and get into it okay so to
prime my eyes I'm using Mac's painterly
paint-pot this is my favorite thing to
prime my eyes with because it takes away
the veins like it covers them up really
well and I have I don't know if you
could you could see that there but I
have really noticeable veins on my
eyelids and this just covers them up I
have to put some underneath my eyes as
well so the eyeshadows that I'm using in
this look come from The Naked basics
palette which is just filled with
amazing neutrals I love this palette so
much so with a you know skinny stiff
dome pencil II brush like this I am
taking the color Naked 2 right here and
I am just working this into my crease
and I'm being very precise like I only
want it in my crease
and I'm going to take that same color
and that same brush and just run it
underneath my eye I'm not being careful
with this at all
it's just going to kind of act as a base
for the other eye shadow that I'm going
to add there later so once you have done
that you're just going to take your
blending brush this is a Mac 217 and
you're going to go into the color faint
which is like the chocolatey Oh dark
brown in this palette and you're just
going to be working this into the outer
V and into the crease you don't want to
take this too far in because we are
going to be putting a color on the lid
later on
now with a clean e-40 brush I am just
going to kind of buff everything and
make it look smooth
I'm also going to be taking that same
paint color and just running it under my
lashes but I'm not going to take it all
the way in
now with just like a flat shader brush
like this I'm going to be taking walk of
shame
and that's going to be my lid color and
I do it after I've done like the outer V
and the crease work and a lot of stuff
because I feel like with these shadows
since walk of shame is such a light
neutral color if you do it first and
then add um faint and add all those
other colors on the outer V and into the
crease you kind of lose walk of shame
you kind of lose that little lid color
you understand where I'm coming from so
I'm just going to take that and put it
on my lid
I'm going to take Boxee and just put it
on the center of my lid
okay so this next step is optional you
could just add your mascara here and
you're good to go you don't have to do
anything else and it'll look fine but I
don't know I just don't feel like myself
unless I have some sort of eyeliner in
my waterline and stuff like that so I'm
gonna take my Maybelline master drama
high liner it's my favorite eyeliner
which I'm sure you can tell if you watch
my videos and I'm just going to water
just going to line my waterline and
tightline as well
like I said before this step is optional
I'm just going to take it a little bit
further to make it a daytime smoky eye
but it will also look appropriate for a
nighttime just in case if you're going
to go out at night you know your eye
makeup will look good in the day and in
the night so I'm going to take the color
crave in this Naked basics palette and
on a brush like this I am just going to
be creating a line really really really
close to my waterline I don't want it to
show up too much because I don't want
this to be like a crazy dramatic you
know look or anything so you just want
to get as close to your lashes as
possible
and the fact that this is in a gel liner
or a liquid liner will make it a lot
more natural I'm also going to take some
of that right around here again as close
to your lashes as possible
and now with my Mac 217 I'm just going
to lightly dab it into this crave color
literally just once and then tap off the
excess and lightly put this into the
outer V just to darken out darken the
outer color
and I render the same on the other side
I'm taking that highlight color called
Venus and I'm just going to highlight
underneath ivory alone and right here
and now I'm just going to add my mascara
I'm using Clinique slash doubling
mascara and by the way I don't know if I
mentioned this before I haven't been
curling my lashes because I feel like my
eyelash curler has been ripping them off
so I've been trying to give my eyelashes
a break which is why I haven't been
using an eyelash curler
I'm not going to do two coats of this
mascara I'm just going to do one I
usually only do one with this mascara I
feel like one's enough for everyday
that's it I hope you like this look this
is the look I love going for whenever I
use my Naked basics palette it's perfect
for everyday and it is quick and easy
and it's a lot quicker when you do it on
your own
because I was trying to explain it so it
took a little bit longer but it is
really fast I do it in five minutes so I
hope you enjoyed this video thanks so

more videos I greatly appreciate it and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
