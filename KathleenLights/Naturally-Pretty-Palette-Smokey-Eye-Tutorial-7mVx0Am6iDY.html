sat down to film this video and I did
one eye and there was Sun there was a
lot of Sun and then I started filming
and there was no Sun there's like a
tornado happening in Florida or
something because the Thunder and the
lightning and the rain is so intense
that I couldn't film the lighting is
absolutely horrid and I know there's
going to be a lot of people commenting
saying where are your lights you were
talking about light and yes I know I
have been talking about lights I've been
saying that I'm gonna get lights but
something happened
long story has to do with my room and
it's a long sort of why I cannot put
lights in this room especially the
lights that I want they don't fit I
don't know how to explain it my room is
tiny here and they just don't fit so I'm
not gonna be able have lights till I'm
back home which would be next month so
in a month in a month I'll be on my
lighting game I'm just so stressed out
because so many things are going wrong
with videos lately I updated iMovie and
I have no idea how to use the new iMovie
and I already suck at editing to begin
with it is just a hot mess so I got
Final Cut Pro and I'm trying to learn
how to use that my friend is teaching me
how to use it and it's just that is the
reason why there has been a lack in
videos this week like all of this week
and it is because the rain doesn't stop
and I am trying to learn a new editing
software so please bear with me please
so honestly it has never been this dark
in this room ever when I'm filming
usually when it's this dark I'm like
forget it I'm not filming today but I
have missed so many videos this week
that I thought maybe a dark one or a
shadowy one was better than none
maybe not maybe you guys are like no
this is way too dark I'm not even
watching this I don't know I'm a little
stressed out anyway sorry for the long
intro I wanted to just update you on a
couple of things
but today's
is using the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette I wanted to do something
that was like really smoky and suitable
for like a night out on the town and you
could obviously make this a little bit
more dramatic and add false lashes I
didn't I never do but I really really
love this look because it is using the
more darker shades in the palette I use
the purple and the navy blue so it's
kind of like a wearable way to wear navy
blue and purple I feel because those
colors seem to be a little bit less
wearable and since this palette is full
of everyday natural colors I decided to
bump it up a little bit and make it more
nighttime appropriate I thought it
looked pretty good if you want to see
how to get this Night Out smokey eye
using this palette then just keep
watching so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to be taking my Mac
painterly paint-pot and I'm going to be
using this to prime my eyelids and cover
up all those veins I'm taking this light
color right here called soft light and
I'm just going to be applying this into
my crease and just basically using this
as my transition shade just buffing it
all over my crease
then I'm going to take the purple in the
palette called violet and on a flat
shader brush I am just going to apply
this all over my lid all the way up to
the crease I'm then going to be taking a
Mac 217 and just blending out those
harsh edges and bringing that color up
into my crease a little bit next I'm
going to take this Urban Decay eye liner
in the color binge and I'm going to
apply this to my waterline and my tight
line as well next I'm going to this navy
blue shade called midnight and on my Mac
217 I'm going to start building this
color up slowly packing it on to the
outer view of my eye and then dragging
it into the crease I'm going to be doing
this over and over again until I get the
desired shade that I want it's just a
lot of building up and blending so just
take your time with this
then I'm just going to take an angled
brush and dip it right into that
midnight color and kind of use this as
an eyeliner really close to my lash line
just to give it a little bit more
dimension and make it look a little bit
more smoky and deep since I'm not going
to be using liquid liner that is what
I'm doing I'm going to take the black in
this palette and I'm just going to pack
this on the outer view of my eye really
focusing it on the outer V just to
deepen it up a little bit and make it
more smoky I'm just going to pack that
on and then start dragging it towards
the center of my eye just to blend out
the little harsh line
next I'm going to dip my falafel brush
into the color violet and I'm just going
to start blending out all the harsh
lines and really just blowing everything
out and kind of diffusing the colors I
really want the purple to stand out in
the crease so I'm just packing this on
doing windshield wiper motions and just
blowing out the look I'm going to move
on to the rest of my face before I
finish up my eyes and I am just going to
prime my face using the maybelline baby
skin instant pore eraser and the
foundation I'm using is my L'Oreal True
Match in the shade and three natural
buff and I am just using a makeup geek
brush to apply it
you
for my concealer I'm going to be using
my Maybelline fit me concealer in the
shade 15 fair and I'm just going to draw
a little triangles underneath my eyes to
cover up my dark circles and to
highlight as well and for more
highlighting I'm just going to run that
down the bridge of my nose in between my
eyebrows a little bit on my forehead on
my Cupid's bow and on my chin as well to
blend that out and just using my Real
Techniques contour brush
you
to set my under eye concealer I'm using
the Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35
creamy natural and I'm also going to be
setting all the other places were added
my concealer really quickly to finish up
my eyes I'm going to take this matte
white shade in the palette and I'm going
to use this to highlight underneath my
brow bone and then I'm going to be
taking the transforming pearl shade and
I'm just going to be adding some of that
right on top just to give it a little
bit more shimmer because this is a very
matte look and then I'm going to add
some in my inner tear-duct as well I'm
going to take that midnight color and on
a pencil brush I'm just going to buff
this underneath my lower lash line just
to smoke it out the mascara I'm using
here is the Jordana best lash extreme
and I'm going to be applying it to my
top and bottom lashes
for bronzer i'm using my NARS Laguna on
a sigma stippling brush and I'm just
going to apply this all over my face
contouring but only a little bit really
just focusing on bronzing up my
complexion
for blush I'm using my L'Oreal True
Match in the shade baby blossom it's a
very cool toned pink and it's really
light I love this blush and I'm just
going to be applying it with my a
cosmetics blush brush and I'm just
dabbing it very lightly on my cheeks I'm
using my Mac soft and gentle as my
highlight for lipstick I'm using my bite
Beauty lipstick in the shade light key
and it is just a very light
Mulvey ish pink and then that completes
this makeup look I'm sorry that I've
been off my game
but I will be back and better than ever
very soon thank you so much for watching
