tutorial this is the look I was wearing
in my olya unboxing and a bunch of you
guys said you wanted a tutorial on it I
did use the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette to achieve this look but
honestly I only used two eyeshadows in
the entire palette this look is mainly
focused around really thick eyeliner and
really big voluminous fake lashes so
basically anybody can achieve this look
as long as you have eyeliner and fake
lashes you're good to go as long as you
use two colors that are similar to the
ones that I used in this tutorial
really this tutorial was kind of an epic
fail this eyeliner came out super wonky
and it was just so frustrating and I
wasn't going to take off all my makeup
so just put it back on so I mean it
looks a little wonky
forgive me but yeah I really want to get
back into filming makeup tutorials more
often I used to do them all the time but
I'm going to get back into filming a lot
more for you guys so leave a comment
down below if there's a palette I have
that you want to see a tutorial on or
anything like that and I will film those
for you if you want to see how to get
this really thick eyeliner thick lashes
look what is this I don't know just keep
watching
so I'm gonna do things a little bit
different in this video I'm starting off
with my face I usually start off with my
eyes but I am taking the bombs tinted
moisturizer called bomb shelter and I'm
going to be using my makeup geek
Foundation stippling brush to apply it
this tinted moisturizer is a little bit
weird when I first apply it you don't
really see much color coming off but as
I buff it into my skin it oxidizes which
is okay for me because it oxidizes
immediately and it matches my neck and
the rest of my body so it's all good and
I'm speeding through this clip because
it's
would take way too long for you to sit
there and see the whole process I put
two layers on my face just to get more
coverage and it's scented moisturizer so
it doesn't get cakey at all I love this
tinted moisturizer I love the finish
it's my fave next I'm going to take my
booboo cover-up concealer and I'm going
to be applying this underneath my eyes
in a triangle shape just to highlight
and cover up my dark circles of course
you
you
I'm using this elf foundation brush just
to blend everything out
now I'm taking my Too Faced eyeshadow
interns and I'm going to prime my
eyelids
and then because I have a lot of veins
on my eyes I'm just gonna take that same
booboo cover-up concealer and add this
to my whole eyelid just so it's a nice
even canvas and there are no veins
poking through or anything like that
next I'm taking my Mac emphasize powder
and with my Real Techniques contour
brush I'm just going to set the
concealer
and I'm also going to bring this onto my
eyelids because this powder has really
pretty good essence to it I don't know
how to explain it it just looks really
really nice and glowy so I like to bring
it on my eyelids as well especially for
this look I just think it looks nice now
I'm taking my it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette and I'm going to take
this shade right here called
transforming pearl and I'm going to use
this to highlight underneath my brow
bone next I'm taking this shade called
mocha and I am going to take my Mac 217
and start adding this to the outer V of
my eye and then slowly bring it into the
crease I just go back and forth with
this eye shadow adding a little by
little
I'm also creating like a triangle with
the same eye shadow just flicking my
brush outwards like that so it looks
like a nice little sharp triangle shape
on the outer reef if you know what I'm
saying
so yeah I just go back and forth with
the eye shadow and build it up a little
by little now I'm going to take this
transforming pearl shade again and I'm
going to add some to the inner parts of
my eye just to make it look nice and
glowy and then this is going to be my
inner corner highlight as well now I'm
going to line my tight line and my
waterline with Maybelline master drama
eyeliner in Midnight Master and then I'm
going to be adding some falsies with
this look these are from House of lashes
and they are in the style called true
romance and I cannot put on false lashes
on camera to save my life it takes
forever so I just did that off-camera
and now I'm taking my Maybelline line
stiletto liquid liner and I'm just
adding a really really thick eyeliner on
top I'm going to go back into that
palette and take the shade mocha and I'm
just going to deepen out my crease with
this and my outer V just a little bit
more
and I'm going to take that same
eyeshadow and run it underneath my
lashes just to smoke it out a little bit
and then I'm going to add mascara moving
on to the rest of my face
I am taking my Bahama Mama bronzer by
the balm and I'm going to be using a
sigma highlighting brush just to contour
my face
and now I'm taking my pixie bronzer and
subtly Sun touched I use this as a blush
because it is a little bit pink and I'm
going to add this to my cheeks then I'm
going to finish off this look with
lipstick this is bite viewing lipstick
in the shade musk and I'm going to apply
this to my lips
and then I'm going to add my NYX butter
gloss in fortune cookie right on top
this is a very very pale nude but I like
to add it to darker lipsticks just to
make them a little bit lighter and that
is the finished look I hope you guys
