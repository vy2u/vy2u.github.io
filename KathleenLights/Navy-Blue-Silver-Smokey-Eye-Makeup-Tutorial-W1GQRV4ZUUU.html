a make a tutorial on these Luke right
here it's very dramatic for me at least
I just wanted to go in like a different
direction from my recent videos I've
done kind of more natural simple
tutorials which I love doing because I
feel like those are easier to recreate
but I wanted to do something like more
smokey more like nighttime appropriate I
would definitely wear this on the night
out on the town and I didn't want to do
anything warm I wanted to do a little
bit more cool tones I wanted to use more
cool tones I actually use the Anastacio
artist palette because I've only used it
once in a tutorial and I wanted to use
it again and the like pop of silver is
this bad boy right here this is the
makeup geek foiled eyeshadow in
high-wire so I really like how this
turned out it's like a blueish silver
smokey eye and I hope you guys enjoy it
if you want to see how to get these look
then just keep on watching okay so my
eyelids are already primed now I'm just
gonna jump into this palette I'm going
to take the shape buttery and I'm going
to apply this all over my lid all the
way up to the brow bone with the morphe
14 brush just you know to create like a
base for all the shadows to blend well
because I used Mac painterly Paint Pot
and that can stay a little bit tacky if
I don't set it then I'm going to take
some scotch tape and put that on the
side of my eye to create like a sort of
cat eye shape and then I'm going to go
into dusty rose and I'm using the morphe
23 brush this is like my new Holy Grail
like fluffy crease brush it's so good I
love it anyway so I'm just applying
dusty rose into the crease from the tape
all the way to the inside of my eye you
know what I mean yeah then I'm going to
take blue velvet this is the star of the
show
and this color you just have to build it
up this part like it's a little bit
tedious but you just have to stick with
it and work with it i'm using the morphe
e17 it's the perfect brush for this
because it's like a small crease brush
but it's perfect it fits right into my
crease perfectly anyway so I'm applying
that on the outer part of my eye where
the tape is and then I'm dragging it all
the way in Mike
as you can see what I'm doing of course
and then I'm going to start applying
some eyeshadow in the very inner corners
of my eye so basically I'm putting the
blue everywhere except the center of the
lid because we're going to be applying
that silver color there so we want the
blue to like hug the silver if that
makes sense
I mean I always say if that makes sense
you guys know it makes sense right yeah
so yes I'm just working back and forth
with that color and then I'm going to go
in to make a geek foiled eyeshadow in
the shade highwire it's like a very
intense silver but it has kind of like
an icy blue hinge to it so I like how it
pairs with the navy blue I'm applying
that on the center of my eyelid with a
Mac 2 7 nope with a Mac 239 brush and
yes then I'm going to go back in to blue
velvet and I'm just going to do the
exact same thing just to intensify the
blue and so that the highwire shade can
blend with the blue
then I'm going to rub off any excess
eyeshadow on that brush and then I'm
going to start blending out the harsh
edges I didn't want to add more blue
because it would get a little bit muddy
so just clean off the brush and started
to smoke out the harsh lines then back
into dusty rose with that same brush I'm
going to start blending out the crease I
really like how it looks like the navy
blue and it kind of fades into like a
dusty mauve I think it looks really
pretty so I am just applying this right
to where the navy blue eyeshadow ends so
it looks like a nice gradient effect and
there are no harsh lines that way either
going right back into buttery I'm going
to use this as my brow bone highlight
I'm also applying that in my inner
corners even though I go back with a
different eye shadow later but anyway
yeah taking the NYX gel liner in black
I'm just applying this to my tight line
I don't like to pull at my eye that's
why I start making these crazy eye
movements because I don't like talking
at my eyelid then I'm going to apply
some liquid liner this is the NYC liquid
liner and I'm just applying a regular
little wing I'm using the tape kind of
like a guide line to where I want the
wing to end and then after that I'm
going to move on to my face before I
finish my eyes to prime my face I'm
using the NYX angel veil primer this is
a little bit of a mattifying primer but
I find that it doesn't dry out my skin
then I'm going in with my morphe sticks
brush and like my new favorite
foundation this is the ex1 invisi wear
foundation I'm an f-100 and I'm just
going to apply this on my entire face
this is like a very natural foundation
it's like a medium coverage but it just
looks like second skin it's beautiful it
blends so nicely I just I love this
foundation and this brush has been
heavenly I love it it's out of stock
which totally sucks but I'm hoping that
they will bring it back and stock very
soon because it's a good one
use a good one then I'm going to take
this Maybelline master conceal concealer
in the shade fair I believe and you've
seen me do this about a million times
I'm just blending that out with my Holy
Grail concealer blender brush this is a
Sedona lace 217 I love this to blend out
my under-eye concealer it's just so soft
and like the perfect size okay so I just
skip through that really quickly but I'm
taking the NYX contour kit and I'm gonna
take the yellow and like the pinky shade
and I'm going to mix them together and
I'm going to set my under eye concealer
with this this is a deli M tools like
highlighter brush
and then I'm going to go ahead and
finish off my eyes before I complete my
face I'm going to go right back into
blue velvet and I'm going to use a
makeup eeeek pencil brush and I'm going
to apply this underneath my lower lashes
I had already plied applied a black
eyeliner but I forgot to film that but I
just applied black eyeliner to my
waterline and now I'm just smoking out
that blue shadow and I'm dragging it all
the way across I'm then going to take
the black eyeshadow in the palette
called kohl and with that same pencil
brush I'm going to smudge that on yeah
and then I put the palette in the camera
and yeah there you go Kathleen I'm just
smudging this on the outer V of my eye
just to deepen that part up a bit and
then to further blend everything so it's
not like a harsh stark line underneath
I'm taking dusty rose and I'm just
blending all those colors together to
smoke it out I'm applying some mascara
and then I applied my ardell demi
wispies on my lashes and then that
completes the eye look so to finish off
my face I'm going to go right back into
the NYX contour kit I'm using this elf
blending brush it is amazing to contour
with it's amazing so I'm just contouring
my face with that cooler tone shade in
the NYX contour kit and I just love this
brush if you guys haven't checked it out
check it out with from ELF it's really
really inexpensive and it's just so soft
and amazing I love it so yes I'm just
contouring my face like I'd normally do
then I'm going to go in with this color
right here it's just a little bit warmer
than the other one not too warm not
orange or anything and I'm just going to
go over that contour again
then I picked up my hair because it was
driving me crazy
anyway I'm taking this yellow banana
shade and I'm applying it right under my
contour with that Delian tools brush
just to intensify the contour it's just
going to sharpen it a little bit and
since this look is a little bit dramatic
I want my contour to stand out a lot
more than I normally would now I'm going
to do something that I've been loving
recently this is the girl lactic face
glow in the shade natural and I'm taking
this on a giant zoeva brush and I'm
applying this everywhere this is a
highlight for the face but it's like the
most natural highlight that it just
gives my face a glow I put this herbal
where I love it it's glowy and it makes
your skin look nice and radiant without
looking greasy or shiny it's fabulous
I'm going to go in with this to face
blush and the shade of baby love it's
their new long-lasting 16 hour blushes
and I'm taking this brush that looks
like it's for me cool tools but it's not
I got it at t.j.maxx I don't even know
the brand but it's a big fluffy brush
very similar to equal tools and I'm
applying this on my cheeks I really like
this color because the natural color
that goes with any makeup look I'm going
right back into the girl lactic face
glow in natural and I'm applying this as
my highlight I would have normally gone
with a more intense highlight but it was
the highlight that was right in front of
me so I used it on my cheekbones as well
I just packed on a little bit more than
I did on my face of course then I took a
pencil brush from Sigma and I applied
this to my inner corners just to
intensify the inner corner a bit a bit
of it and then for lips I am using this
essence lipstick in the shade also matte
and then I thought it was just a little
bit too matte I wanted something a
little gloss here so I took the Revlon
lipstick in pink kognito to give it a
little bit more shine and then that
completes this makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoyed it please subscribe if
you have it already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
