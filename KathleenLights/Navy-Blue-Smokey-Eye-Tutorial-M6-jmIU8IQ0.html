camera is dying um I did this maybe blue
smokey eye for you guys using a navy
blue that's in a lorac palette I have
that came in like this Holiday
Collection like two years ago and it
came in like a jewelry box type thing
was really glittery and I have a night
palette and a date palette and I don't
know about you but I'm not the biggest
fan of these eyeshadows I don't know if
it's all the rock eyeshadows but it's
super powdery and I feel like the
pigmentation is not there for half of
these eyeshadows so for this look I had
to use a a really bright teal eyeshadow
base I mean I used the NYX jumbo eye
pencil in peacock because if I were to
use a navy blue by itself like with a
primer potion or like painterly
paint-pot or something it would look
black it would not look navy blue like
this at all
so if you have a navy blue at home that
you're like oh my god there's no pigment
in this at all try to use a like a pop
of color under like a bright teal or a
bright blue even so hope you like this
and if you want to see how I got this
look then keep watching okay before I
start I just have to tell you one thing
this look does not look nice till the
very end it's one of those looks that
you just got to pull through and finish
it and clean it up and then it looks put
together and it looks nice it looks like
a hot mess before it looks hot just want
to put that out there because halfway
through this thing you're going to be
like girl what are you showing me okay
so the first thing you want to do is
prime your eyelid and I'm just
using Urban Decay's primer potion taking
that all the way up and I'm putting it
under my eyes well now I'm taking NYX
jumbo eye pencil in peacock and I'm
putting that all over my lid
and don't take it past the crease and
and now I'm just going to blend it out a
little bit now I'm taking a Mac 239 and
I'm going into that navy blue color from
the lorac Knight palette this eyeshadow
has a lot of Fallout so the trick to
that is just to really packed your lid
instead of sweeping your um brush across
you need to really pack it so that the
pigmentation is there and so that you
don't have fallout all over your face so
I'm just going to start packing that on
with padding motions
okay so once you've done that you're
just going to brush your brush off as
well as you can and then flip it like
this and just kind of pull on the
eyeshadow it's just kind of get rid of
the harsh line a little we're just
trying to pull the eyeshadow up because
we didn't take it past the crease but
we're just gonna stretch the eyeshadow a
little bit if that makes any sense
okay now after I've done that I'm taking
my naked palette and I'm going to be
using naked a buck to really blend this
look out the key so this look is a lot a
lot a lot of blending so I'm taking
naked first and I'm going to be putting
that not directly into the crease but
right on top of it and I'm just going to
go back and forth with this color
this is just gonna really start the
transition process if you know what I
mean
I'm also taking some eye color and
blending the harsh sorry like flipping
off the harsh lines right there
okay so after that I'm going to take
buck and I'm going to put this directly
into the crease like into the socket and
like wiggle it around until it's really
really blended out
I'm not going to bring this color all
the way in because I don't want that
buck colored to like show up a lot there
so I'm just working this into my crease
staying away from the inner part of my
eye and this part is just really up to
you if you don't want to blend out that
much then you stop here if you want it
really really blended then you continue
with this color until you find that it's
blended to your liking
this is what's gonna keep your look from
being too harsh or looking like got
punched in the eye
okay so that's blended pretty well now
so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to take a pencil brush like this
this is the Sigma e30 and I'm taking
buck and not precisely at all I'm just
going to run this right here under my
bottom lashes this is just going to be
like kind of like the base for the other
colors that we're putting there so it
doesn't look too harsh
next I'm going to be taking this cutter
right here it's called dark horse and on
an angled brush like this I'm just going
to run that really close to my waterline
after I do that I'm going back into that
navy blue and with the same brush I'm
going to get it really close to my
lashline but I'm not going to swipe my
brush across like I've been doing with
the other colors I'm going to Pat it in
I'm going back in to buck and then I am
just gonna kind of blend that out
okay to kind of deepen the look up a
little bit I still want the navy blue to
be the center focus of the eye which is
just kind of make it a little bit darker
on the outer corner I'm taking Dark
Horse and creep and I'm taking that same
239 brush and I'm just going to pack
that on to my outer be really lightly
and not too much at all but just to give
it a little bit of dimension
okay now time to actually clean the look
up a little bit and this is where it
starts to look nice okay I'm going to
take my makeup remover wipe and wrap it
around my finger and I'm going to kind
of swipe my face first let's get rid of
any fallout and then I'm going to kind
of clean up the bottom and then I'm
going to swipe it up so that it gets a
kind of like cat Angle effect if you
know what I mean
and then you just clean that up
okay for my highlight because there's so
much shimmer and every eye shadow I use
is really shimmery I'm gonna take a
matte cream color eye shadow and I'm
gonna use that as my highlight here I'm
just using the vanity palette for my
mouth and I'm taking this matte like
creamy color
I'm also going to be taking that same
color and I'm going to be adding that to
my tear duct
now I'm taking Maybelline master drama
eyeliner and I'm gonna line my waterline
and on the top as well
now if Fox lashes would probably be
ideal for this look but I'm not really
into false lashes I don't wear them
often at all so I'm just going to pack
on my Clinique laughs uh bling mascara
and I'll be right back okay so I've
already applied my foundation I used
L'Oreal True Match really this is in n
three natural book and whenever I do
this look I never wear blush I know for
some reason I feel like it's too much
you know that seems ridiculous but
that's just the way that I feel my
absolute favorite thing to contour with
is max harmony blush it's it's my
favorite I feel like it's perfect and
how I contour is just from the tops of
my ears
to where my pupil is so just I stopped
right at my people so I take a contour
brush like this this is the fo5 and I
just start from the very tops right here
and feel like where the hollows of my
face are that make sense like where face
dense I'm not good at explaining that
but and I just lightly start sweeping it
back I start with a light hand so that I
don't put too much and then it's like go
crazy so just start with a light hand
you can do a little kissy face that
works
so after I do that I just take my NYC
sunny bronzer and hey Sigma f50 and I
just kind of blend everything out and
bring it up a little bit
bring that up to my temples another zone
it's awful crude on my chin
and then under my eyes I have crazy dark
circles under my eyes so what I do is I
take my Anastasia matte highlighter it's
just like a pink crayon and I put that
under my eyes like this and then I run
that out with my fingers
and then on top of that I use my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser in fair and I kind of put
that everywhere I bring that down kind
of like the typical triangle concealer
thing that's what I do here and I blend
that out with my fingers
you can go ahead and set that I never do
because my skin is so crazy dry I feel
like every time I set foundation or
concealer it just gets pickets it gets
bad so for my lips I am just going to
line my lips with Max and sink and top
it off with pretty please
okay so that's the finished look I hope
you liked it please subscribe for more

video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
