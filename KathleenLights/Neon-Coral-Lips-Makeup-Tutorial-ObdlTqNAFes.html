tutorial on this look right here
actually okay so a while ago I posted
this picture on Instagram and I did my
random favorites like um was it a month
ago or two months ago already and I was
wearing this exact makeup it was that
same day and I got so many requests to
do the look I was wearing in that video
and in this picture and for some reason
I just forgot about it and never did it
but then as the days kept going on I
noticed that every single day it was
still being requested like I kept
getting questions like what are you
gonna do that tutorial using the zoeva
cocoa blend palette I get questions
every single day so I'm so sorry that
this video is going up so late I should
have done this like a month ago but it
is a tutorial using the zoeva cocoa
blend palette if I'm going to be
completely honest with you I didn't want
to post this I'm totally serious I
wasn't going to because I mean this
looks so similar to looks I have I have
already done even my anastacio one that
I did recently looks a little bit like
this but I don't ever want you guys to
feel like I'm not listening to you and
I'm not putting out videos that are
being requested this is sort of us for
you guys who wanted to see it I mean it
is a little different because I normally
would pair it with a nude but I love
this lip with this look it's the same
lip I was wearing in that video the eyes
are a little bit different because I
don't exactly remember how I did it to
be completely honest with you I don't
really remember so I just you know
winged it and it's kind of it's a very
very very very simple makeup look it's a
little bit messy like it's just like
shimmer everywhere it's not very precise
and very neat which I really like it it
gives it like a boho vibe and very
summery I really hope you guys enjoy
this makeup look and if you want to see
how to get it well just give up okay so
my eyes are already primed and I am just
going to jump into these zoeva Coco
blend palette I'm taking the color pure
ganache and I am putting this all over
my eye it's a very intense gold
beautiful color
I love it so that's going to go in my
inner corners as well just all over the
place then I'm going to take this really
pretty camel color it's called
substitute for love and this is a crease
brush by the brand Luxy I got it in an
Ipsy bag and I am just blending that
into my crease very messily this look is
not precise so even if you don't know
how to blend much this is the look for
you just throw it in there then I'm
going to dip my brush into warm notes
it's a stunning cranberry shade and I'm
just putting that lightly on top of the
gold just so that it can make more of a
rose gold Orange II kind of look like
the to mix together are really pretty
then I'm going to take the color called
freshly toasted very similar to Mac's
Brown script you know like in that
family and I am putting that on the
outer part and in my crease as well then
I'm going to dip my brush into bitter
start and I'm just going to apply that
to my brow bone then I'm going to take
more of a regular eyeshadow brush this
is from Coastal Scents and I am packing
beans are white on the outer portion of
my eye and into my crease yes the eye
shadow is called beans are white I know
I don't get it
then I'm just going to take sweeter end
and apply that right on top of the gold
in my inner corner and then I'm just
going to quickly move on to the rest of
my face I'm actually just going to go
ahead and do my entire face makeup
really quick so I primed my face with
the NYX
angel veil primer and then I'm going to
go in with the covergirl outlast stay
luminous foundation I'm pretty sure I'm
in the shade 842 I love this foundation
it's a great one from the drugstore
because it's very luminous perfect for
my dry skin so this next product was a
recommendation on one of you guys on my
concealer video this is the L'Oreal True
Match concealer so I put that underneath
my eyes and then I topped it off with
the Mac prep and prime light boost yes
in light boost this is the yellow one
and then I'm going to take the Mac
highlighter and I'm just going to
highlight the rest of my face with it I
really like that True Match concealer so
thank you so much to the beautiful
subscriber who recommended it to me
it's really really blendable I like it a
lot thank you so you know the drill just
gonna blend that in with my Sedona lace
217 brush and just blend that in that
through much concealer so threw me off
the first time I used it because it's
not a doe foot applicator it's like a
little tiny brush just that I let you
know oh I was actually looking to the
side right there because Cornelius and
Porter were having a full-on staring
competition they were both like stiff as
stones staring at each other it was so
funny oh my gosh dogs are so funny
anyway so yes blend that out you guys
know I'm just London nothing fancy I'm
gonna go and move on to cream products
before I set my under eye concealer this
is a cream highlight buy you a in the
shade tra and I'm applying that with
like a regular standard foundation brush
by Real Techniques onto my cheekbones
just to give some more glow to my face
and then I'm going to continue on with
the cream products before I set my
concealer so I'm going to take the
bourgeois bronzing primer essentially
just like a cream bronzer and then I'm
going to take this angled kabuki style
brush by Real Techniques and I'm just
packing this onto my face like on my
cheeks to warm up my face it is a warmer
bronzer so I'm not contouring or
anything so now I'm going to set my
under eye concealer and first I'm just
going to dab my like my finger
underneath my eye to get rid of any
creasing and then I'm going to go ahead
and set that with the Mac mineralize
skinfinish in medium I'm also going to
set anywhere else I put that Mac prep
and prime pencil thingy down so now I'm
actually going to bronze my skin this is
a real techniques multitask brush and
this is the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer just adding a little bit on my
cheeks and around my forehead and now
I'm going to take this product this is
stunning beautiful baked bronzer by
Milani I'm not sure what the name is but
I'll leave it down below this just gives
a beautiful beautiful beautiful peachy
glow to the cheeks I'm obsessed with it
it's beautiful from the drugstore I
already said beautiful but it's amazing
anyway
now I'm just going to set everything
using the tatcha do we skin mist not set
everything I just want to make the look
more luminous and glowy so that's why I
applied that so to finish on my eyes I'm
going to take pure ganache and I'm only
going to apply this right on the center
of my eyelid just to bring some light to
the lid now I'm just going to line my
waterline and my lashline with the NYX
treasure Li eyeliner and let that run I
know I'm sorry anyway and that was the
brown eyeliner by NYX then on a pencil
brush I just applied substitute for love
on the lower lash line to smoke it out
and then I took beans or white and I
applied that on the outer corners just
to make it a little bit more smoky and
then with my pinky I dipped my finger in
pure ganache and applied it right on the
center part of the lower lash line to
finish off my eyes I just applied a few
coats of the L'Oreal telescopic mascara
on the top and bottom lashes
so the finishing touch what really pulls
this look together is this lip color
this is the liquid lipstick by Stella in
Venezia don't know how to say it but it
will be down below so that completes
this look I really hope you guys enjoyed
it thank you so much for watching I love
