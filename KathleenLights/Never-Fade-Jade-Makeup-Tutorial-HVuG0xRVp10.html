a makeup tutorial on the eye makeup I'm
wearing right now
I wore this look in my foundation
routine and a couple of people commented
saying that they wanted to see a
tutorial on it so of course like always
you ask and you shall receive so before
you start talking up a storm I'm just
gonna go ahead and get into the tutorial
okay so I have no makeup on at the
moment I only have my eyebrows filled in
and I don't have any makeup on my face
because I always do my eye makeup first
especially dealing with like loose
pigments that can tend to have some
fallout so I'm gonna start out with the
Urban Decay primer potion this is just
the original one and that is gonna be my
primer and I'm gonna make sure to take
it all the way up to my brow bone okay
so next I'm gonna add a base so that the
pigment has something to stick onto and
for that I am using the NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk is just a white base
and then I'm just gonna blend it out
okay so now I'm gonna take any fluffy
blending brush and I'm gonna be taking
this eyeshadow right here it is called
saddle it is a very very warm brown and
I'm just going to be putting this into
my crease this is going to be the
transition color
and my camera died so when I went to go
Target I went ahead and did this I so
I'm just gonna finish the tutorial off
with this I okay so after I lay down the
transition color I'm going to go ahead
and take the pigment I'm using and I'm
using the color tattoo pure pigment in
never fade Jade and I'm just gonna pour
some onto the cap and then I'm going to
take my Mac 239 brush and just pack that
color onto my lid
I'm not going to take it past the crease
I'm really focusing it on the lid and
that's it
okay so once I've done that I'm going to
be taking this cover right here called
soba and it's just a cooler Brown than
the radish when we put down and I'm
taking it on a mac 217 and I'm just
gonna be using this color to blend out
any harsh lines
I'm also going to be packing this color
on the outer part of my lid as well
okay so next I'm gonna be taking this
color right here call it gorgeous gold
it's just some yellow it's like some
reflex of like green it's a really cool
color and I'm taking it on this little
flat shader brush from Coastal Scents
and I'm just gonna be adding this to the
outer part of my eye and a little bit on
the crease and this just kind of gives
some dimension to the look because it
has like that green in it and it really
stands out when you layer it on top of
this pigment
okay and next I'm going back into that
never fade Jade color and pack some more
on the lid just in case we lost some
from all the blending just focusing in
on the center of my lid
okay back with my 217 and back into this
saddle color I'm just gonna take that
and add some more right here for my
highlight you can take any color you
want but I'm just gonna use shrew by Mac
and I'm gonna use this as the highlight
underneath my brow bone
and in my tear duct
okay so really quickly I'm just gonna
add this Maybelline master drama
eyeliner in Midnight master to my
waterline and my tight line okay and now
I'm just gonna add my winged liner for
that I'm using my Maybelline eye studio
gel liner in blackest black and this is
the best gel eyeliner in the world and
I'm just using it on the brush it came
with it's actually a very good brush to
use and I can't feel myself doing
eyeliner to save my life so let's see if
I can basically I'm just gonna do a
pretty thin line on the top
and then the way I do my wing line it's
pretty simple I just take the brush and
squeeze it and that's weird but I make
it very very thin and then I dip it into
the gel liner and make a line just like
that
and then I connected
okay so for my lower lashline I'm just
gonna take the color saddle on a pencil
brush and just run that underneath my
lower lashes
then I'm going to take soba and do the
exact same thing
okay so now I'm going to add my mascara
and for that I'm using the Maybelline
colossal volume express mascara and then
I'm gonna do the rest of my face and I
will be right back okay so that's it I
did the rest of my face makeup off
camera because I always do it in all my
videos and I don't know if that gets
boring to watch or what and I just want
to save some time but if you want to
know what's on the rest of my face I
will have all the products down below
