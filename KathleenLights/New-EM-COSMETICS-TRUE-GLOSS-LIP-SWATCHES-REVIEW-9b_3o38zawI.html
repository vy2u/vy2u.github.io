a review and lip swatches on the brand
new M cosmetics lip glosses you guys
have no idea how excited I have been for
this launch ever since I saw things get
posted on the em cosmetics Instagram I
have been on top of this I've been so
freaking excited so I just recently got
the PR box in the mail this is what it
looks like with a Lim Cosmetics logo I
am so giddy for M cosmetics every single
time I love everything about the brand
and then look at this PR box this is
such an 80s picture like this is so cool
I could just picture somebody looking at
this photo like a kid looking at this
photo and being like oh my god is this a
real 80 spot or is this like a
millennial 80s photo you know cuz now
everything is like back in style from
back in the day doesn't this group kind
of look like cardi B like with short
hair no I think okay anyway M Cosmetics
has released new glosses they are called
the true gloss and they are volumizing
lip glosses they retail for seventeen
dollars and these are incredible these
are incredible they're exactly what I
thought they were gonna be it is a gel
based formula that supposedly has like
certain ingredients that are supposed to
volumize your lips but it's not
something that's gonna sting or burn
it's not like an actual lip plumper this
is extremely extremely mild you really
have to pay attention to feel it you do
feel it if you are very sensitive to lip
plumpers I still think you might like
this because the tingle is very mild but
there's just something about having that
minimal ingredient in there or something
that really just smoothes out the lips
and you kind of notice your lips look a
little bit more plump it's subtle but
it's something that you can tell these
glasses are not sticky at all they're
not gloppy they're not goopy they're not
uncomfortable they are extremely
extremely comfortable and they're very
pigmented as well it's not one of those
glosses that are gonna be glossy if
you're into a glossy kind of gloss that
it's mainly just like high high shine
very thick and kind of sticky and tacky
and those kind of have like a very sheer
color it's mostly gloss if you're into
those these might not be for you these
are a little bit more gel based like I
said and they're not sticky whatsoever
but they do have quite a bit of shine to
them like your lips do look shiny
I'm wearing this one on my lips right
now it's called truffle haze and like I
said it's not glossy glossy but there is
some shine to it I only did one layer
like I dipped on my wand in took it out
and applied it to my lips I didn't read
it and do two layers because when you do
that it does get a little bit more
glossy and it does look a little shinier
if you do two layers but one layer is
totally enough you get your entire lips
full color it's just not as shiny I
really like the formula on these a lot
you know what it kind of reminds me of
it reminds me of a much better version
of the two-faced peach oil lip glosses I
think that's what they're called I don't
know if you guys have tried those but
I've spoken about the formula a lot in
the past where it feels like a gel and
when you press your lips together it's
still hard to explain him but it doesn't
feel like a lacquer gloss it kind of
feels like a moisturizing balm formulas
very unique I don't have many glosses
that feel like this I highly recommend
it I wore the shade caramel glaze for
the majority of the day yesterday and I
did have to reapply throughout the day I
mean it's Friedan lip gloss it's not a
liquid lipstick so if you're looking for
a very long-lasting lip gloss I wouldn't
say this is it you will have to reapply
this if you want a lip gloss that's very
long-lasting I would recommend something
a lot more tacky sticky and glossy those
tend to last longer but these are just a
little bit more comfortable
I don't mind reapplying east no big deal
I like how it wears throughout the day
it doesn't get a weird at least this one
didn't get a weird but whole thing
around my lips and I'm telling you I
just really enjoyed how comfortable this
was on my lips I've said the word
comfortable like a hundred times in this
video I know but I just I really like
these glosses I've been testing them out
for about three days now and I gotta say
they're wooden from me I feel like em
cosmetics doesn't know wrong everything
they come out with I love eyeliner
amazing like with lipstick amazing
amazing I hope they come out with more
nudes I know they just launched but I
just love nude lip glosses so I would
love it if they created more nudes and
like more browns but anyway they have
twelve shades so far and these are
available they launched June 11th so you
can get these on the em cosmetics
website but anyway if you want to see
lip swatches on these twelve shades then
just keep watching because I'm gonna do
that for you right now
okay guys so those were the lip swatches
on all 12 shades love the color
selection love the formula I don't feel
like these get patchy or weird even the
darker colors I feel like they do apply
really nicely anyway I just really enjoy
these by the way yes I have my fake nose
ring on I just have to mention it every
time I do a video because I don't know
if they're new subscribers out there no
I didn't get a real nose ring I'm not
gonna get a real nose ring I just like
to rock a fake one sometimes also I have
to really large pimples here and turn
them into beauty marks so that's what's
on my face today but anyway guys I hope
