and simple video but I just wanted to
quickly come on here and tell you guys
what's been going on if you follow me on
any of my social media sites you would
already know and if you saw my latest
vlog you would already know as well but
for those of you have been subscribed to
my channel for a while now you guys know
that Danny was on deployment for six
months and when he left on deployment I
went back home to Miami to spend time
with my family for those six months but
Danny just recently like a week ago got
back from deployment and it's great it
was a very long six months if you
haven't seen the vlog I will link it
down below it was it's basically Danny's
homecoming we've logged everything and I
will link it down below if you haven't
seen it but I've been back home with
Danny for about a week and a half now so
the last six videos that were on my
channel were pre-recorded when I was in
Miami I wanted to pre-record videos
because I knew I was gonna have internet
for a while so I don't want like gaps in
between you know I just want to like not
put out videos for like a whole two
weeks because I know you guys would be
very upset about that so I pre-recorded
enough videos but I'm back and this is
new footage new material so nothing is
pre-recorded anymore um things are
different this is my new setup I still
have to tweak certain things around so I
don't know what I'm doing yet it's like
6 o'clock in the afternoon well it's
like pretty late almost 7 o'clock and I
still have sunlight I have a huge window
in front of me which you guys know in
Miami I struggled with natural light
because I had a teeny tiny window in my
room so it was it was tough but I have a
huge window and I'm still like working
on everything and this
some stuff and if you guys have been a
subscriber to my channel for a long time
will recognize this bad boy right here
this was my original desk when I first
started my youtube videos but since
anyone on deployment I had to put her in
storage for six months but now he's back
and she's back and it's exciting because
I loved this desk and I missed it so
much as well start up again on Monday
recent videos new videos nothing
pre-recorded I will be posting the lorac
2 palette review and swatches this week
coming up I know a lot of you guys have
asked me to do it so that will be up
this week new stuff is coming your way
and I have a lot of good ideas for new
videos and yeah I'm just happy I'm
excited that Danny got here safely I was
like a hot mess by the way I wasn't
going to film a video today at all like
in a t-shirt and having a brush my hair
today at all and by the way I am looking
at the viewfinder like this entire video
because I want to see how the setup
looks in my viewfinder I'm not like
checking myself out for those of you who
love to comment that and seeing if I
like it or not or what's going on there
so yeah I will be looking at the camera
a lot more from now on ok I promise no
more looking at the viewfinder guys give
me a break ok I just have to make sure
I'm in focus and I just I got to see
what I'm working with here alright so
