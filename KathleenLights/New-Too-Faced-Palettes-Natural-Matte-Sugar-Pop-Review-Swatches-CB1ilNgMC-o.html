a quick because you know I'm not quite
fitting on to new palates that two-face
will be releasing the Too Faced natural
matte and the sugar pop palette this is
what they look like they have a ton of
these little palettes that they come out
with all the time I think I'm losing my
voice by the way I'm like oh I like Vin
Diesel really quickly just one mentioned
I'm sorry that I haven't had a video up
at all this summer my camera Danny and I
have been painting and painting and
painting and that's all we've been doing
in this house there's still so much to
be done and we're not done so that is
what I'm doing the majority of my day
that is why there hasn't been a video up
and it's been killing me I'm so sorry
but I'm just so busy with like housework
but Madore got painted it used to be
yellow if you remember that and actually
the closet doors are in the process of
being painted so that's why it's like my
closet has no door yeah that is why
there hasn't been a video once we're
settled and we're good I will go back to
posting three times a week I know a lot
of you guys have asked me if I'm like
not doing that schedule anymore but I am
I will be posting Mondays Wednesdays
Fridays as soon as everything goes back
to normal
which hopefully will be in the near
future my lights come on Tuesday so
that's a good thing they get here
Tuesday and I'm very excited so yeah
anyway back to what the video is about
so I'm not exactly sure when the release
of these pallets are but I think that
Ulta will be getting them early and I'm
pretty sure these will release like
spring 2015 very soon pretty sure and I
wasn't going to post this video but I
thought maybe a swatch video would be
helpful for any of you guys who are
interested in this palette I haven't
done like a palette review on my channel
in a long time so these were sent to me
by Too Faced and know this video isn't
sponsored they didn't ask me to make
this way
yo I just decided to film it I actually
I'm obsessed with to face if you watch
my channel you guys know it's my
favorite like brand at Sephora like my
favorite and I have purchased every
single two-faced item that I own myself
um but they just recently found out who
I was like two months ago which is
really exciting for me since it's my
favorite but I just want as much of that
yes they were sent to me but you know
it's not sports or soul okay so I'm
going to start off with my favorite one
of course and it is the Too Faced
natural matte palette you guys have seen
these before they have the same
packaging they always come out with
these little palettes this retails for
$36 like all of their palettes that look
like this
I love their new revamped packaging it's
my favorite I think it's really cute and
sleek they used to have packaging like
this this is my natural eye palette
which is probably my favorite Too Faced
palette like this will be sighs a
chocolate bar I mean come on and it was
just really bulky and not attractive
like this packaging not cute nope I love
their new packaging it's really nice oh
my god my voice is gaming me so the
natural matte palette is honestly in my
opinion like the sister to the natural
natural eyes palette they pretty much
have the same print except this one is
brown and there are a lot of eyeshadows
in this palette that are already in the
natural eyes palette but this is 100%
matte completely matte oh and it has a
mirror which I like and I honestly think
this palette is wonderful 100% wonderful
it was on my eyes right now on the top
portion of my eyes my lower lash line is
using the sugar pop there are so many
companies that are coming out with my
eyeshadows like in pellet form and this
is one of my favorite ones hands down
because of the undertones in this
palette they're not all warm or they're
not all cool there's a mixture of
undertone
this palette which I really love it's
kind of split up into sections just like
all of their other ones are de classic
and fashion and the de section like the
de row if you can see it's a very cool
toned row they have heaven which isn't
really cool tone but it's not like a
warm peach or anything
this one works as a really nice matte
highlight for underneath the Bravo and
it's what I'm using today
cashmere bunny is a really pretty cool
tone Brown it's really nice in the
crease or to smoke out your lower
lashline and sex Barroso is kind of like
Kashmir bunny just ten times darker a
cool tone deep brown which I feel like
everybody needs in their makeup
collection to just deepen out their
looks
I love sex bar so I use it all the time
it's actually one of the eyeshadows that
is in the natural eyes and I love it the
next row is the classic row and you have
lace Teddy strapless and risque and lace
teddy is a really pretty light light
pink this is the perfect eye shadow to
apply on your entire lid and then put
something else in the crease it's
something that's just going to give you
a nice wash of like a light matte color
strapless is beautiful definitely one of
my favorite eyeshadows in this palette
it's a pinky Brown definitely a
beautiful rosy Brown this second rung
here is definitely like the rosy shades
the Browns with the pinky undertones to
them so strapless definitely has that
rosiness to it which I really really
love and then risque is a beautiful deep
brown but it's completely different from
sex Pro so not only is it a little bit
lighter than sex Pro so but it has like
a purpley rosy again rosy undertone to
it and then the last row is the fashion
row and this is my favorite row because
it has the warm colors the first one is
nudie and it is a perfect basic crease
color like you cannot go wrong with this
especially if you have fair skin because
it's a very light light light brown then
honey butter which is the color I have
all over my lid
I have new T in my crease but then I
have honey butter everywhere I put it
everywhere
it's a beautiful like peanut butter
brown seriously it's like peanut butter
it's beautiful I have it all over mended
and then chocolate cookie is another
really really warm orange II kind of
brown it's so pretty I have this on the
outer views of my eye today so I have it
like can you see it's like on the outer
portion and then dust it into my crease
I'm definitely like losing my voice I'm
getting sick I am so that is the look I
have today but I also do have sex presto
a little bit on the outer corner just to
give some deepness to it every single
color in this palette is completely
different and at first glance you kind
of think oh nudie and cashmere bunny
look pretty similar but they're not
nudie is a lot more warm like when you
first swatch new to you're like oh
that's not very warm because it doesn't
look very warm in the pan but next to
cashmere bunny you see it's a lot warmer
so this one right here is cashmere bunny
and this one is new D as you can see it
pulls more peach so I love that about
this palette that you get all different
undertones you get like your rosy Browns
your cool tone Browns and your warm
Browns
so this is basically the perfect
companion palette in my opinion you can
grab any palette that has a bunch of
shimmers and a bunch of different colors
a bunch of different undertones and you
will find a transition shade a smoky
color anything in this palette because
of the diversity the only thing that I
feel like this palette is missing is in
black just a pure matte black eyeshadow
that is the only thing I wish this
palette had and if I had that it would
be literally the perfect matte palette
in the entire world
maybe if risque would have been black I
think or I don't know this expresso is
the darkest color and if you do pack
this on you do get really deepness to it
so I mean I could look past their not
having black so I quickly wanted to show
you this in comparison to the natural
eyes palette because a lot of you guys
asked me well I have the natural eyes do
I need the natural matte because there
are shades that double in this palette
so the natural eyes is both matte and
shimmery for matte shades and five
shimmer
shades and the format shades that are in
this palette are in the natural matte
palette even the entire first row it has
heaven cashmere bunny and six preso just
like this one there first rows are both
identical and then they have new tea in
common they both have new tea here in
the corners but then all the other
eyeshadows are different in this palette
the rest are shimmery so do I think that
you need this even though you have this
maybe for a makeup lover like me I think
so because I think they are different
they do different things the other
shimmery eyeshadows in this palette make
it worth it to buy this and then the
nice rosy mattes and the warm matte to
me make it worth it to buy this also so
that is my take on this palette in terms
of pigmentation I did show you guys
swatches while I was talking about this
I keep in mind that those watches were
without a primer so I didn't put an
eyeshadow base or a primer on the back
of my hand to swatch them they go on the
eyes so much better than they swatch on
the hand I mean I'm wearing it on my
eyes and I've been wearing this palette
every single day since I go every day
that I've worn makeup since I got this
and it has held up amazingly well but
they go on super buttery super smooth
and they are really really easy to blend
out I'm talking like very easy these
matte eyeshadows are not chalky they're
not powdery they don't have that weird
kick up when you put your brush in that
some eyeshadows have that's like the
eyeshadow goes everywhere and it makes a
mess they don't have that but they're
still soft and blendable so I definitely
give this a big thumbs up I'm gonna give
it a B+ I would give it an 8 if it had a
black but I'm gonna get a B+ okay now
let's talk about the sugar pop palette
now this one is definitely for the
colorful lover it has a bunch of
different colors but they did throw in
some neutrals in there which I
appreciate because you don't want like a
whole colorful you die you know you want
to throw some neutral colors in there or
don't whatever you do you girl I don't
love this one as much
the natural matte because I'm a neutral
girl but it is still a really pretty
palette the packaging on this one is
really pretty though it has a bunch of
macaroons on them it's seriously the
packaging is so beautiful so the first
row here is called sweet and spicy and
you have a peachy kind of shade it's
really similar to Urban Decay's foxy
where it's like a light like yellowy
base color also really really nice to
highlight the problem I've used it
before for that and it works wonders
then you have macaroon which is a really
pretty like peachy orange it's not too
too intense it's like a really pretty
orange coral and this one is not my
favorite I thought it was going to be
like my favorite out of all of them
because I love oranges but I don't know
if it's because it has like little
shimmers in them it's it doesn't blend
as well as all the other ones and it's
not as pigmented as all the other ones
I'm sure if I use like a really nice I
shadow base then it will work I still
have to play with this one a lot more so
let me not you know jump the gun but it
doesn't pack a punch like I would want
it to this next one is called malted
milk ball and it is my favorite in the
palette probably because it's a really
pretty bronze shade but this really
catches the light on your eyeballs it
has like a sheen to it like a golden
sheen the next row is sugar plums and
you get this really gorgeous eyeshadow
called strawberry ice and it's like a
lilac but in certain lights it looks
almost pink as well I don't know it's
really strange but it's really really
beautiful sugared violet is another
favorite of mine it's a beautiful
intense navy blue but it has a lot of
purple to it I think I think it has like
a purple undertone I could be wrong but
it is gorgeous aqua berry is one that
does not swatch good at all like you
swatch on the back of your hand and
you're like what is this it's not very
pigmented and it doesn't swatch that
well but when I couldn't run my eyes I
was really really impressed because it I
don't know why it works really well on
the eye
have this smoked out on the outer V on
the bottom like right here on my lower
lashline and as soon as I put it to my
eye I could tell that it was like a
purple I could tell that it was a brown
that had a lot of purple to it and I
didn't think I was going to because it
didn't swatch so I was like this is just
gonna look like a basic Brown but no I
see the purple big-time and I actually
really really love this eyeshadow then
you have the candy coated roe and it has
peach fuzz which I don't like this color
that much to me it's pretty much just
like rock candy with a bunch of little
sparklers all sparkers sparkles all
throughout it but then when you apply it
to your skin you don't really see the
sparkles so to me there's like two rock
candies in here I don't know then there
is bubblegum it's a really pretty
pigmented pink very very pigmented it
goes on the eyes better than it does on
the hand for some weird reason and then
my other super favorite in this palette
and it is blue raspberry this is what I
have on my lower lashline today but it
mixed it in with some Brown I just
wanted the brown to look a little bit
like greeny kind of and I love it this
one is so pigmented and it goes on the
lid so beautifully it's it's definitely
the color that I didn't think I was
going to like and it's one of the ones
that I like the most so alright I do
think this palette is a hit if you like
color mixed in with some neutrals the
only eye shadow I don't like as peach
fuzz and I have to play around with
macaroon more but the rest are definite
hits for me especially blue raspberry
blackberry and malted milk ball oh and I
really love sugared violet as well these
colorful eyeshadows look really nice
with a base for example i swatched
sugared violet on top of different bases
to show you i swatched it by itself and
then the swatch in the middle is sugared
violet on top of a white base and then
they last swatch is that blue eyeshadow
on top of a black base so the black base
just made it a lot more like smokey and
metallic and darker and then the white
base just made it a lot more vibrant so
definitely keep that in mind when you're
working with colorful eyeshadows if you
want them to pop a lot more and then
just
use like a white bass or something like
that so those were my thoughts on the
new Too Faced palettes that are coming
out I really like both of them but I
definitely like this one a lot more
because I love mattes and I love
neutrals but you know it's all about
preference girls and guys so yeah that
completes this video I hope it wasn't
pointless and some of you guys were
actually interested in this I actually
got a comment in my last video that said
that my videos are looking not
repetitive but that my videos are kind
of just becoming the same thing that I
film like the same thing all the time
which I can totally understand um I'm
gonna try to switch things up more
especially when I get settled things
things will get crazy here okay we will
Phil I will film good videos but I just
I can't right now I haven't filmed this
tutorial in a while on my channel
because those take a long time to edit
and those take a long time to film and
honestly I just need videos like this
where I can film really quick and then
continue painting and doing that kind of
stuff so I definitely apologize for that
and things will go back to normal soon
leave me requests down below for any
video you want to see in the future and
I will definitely film the one that gets
like the most likes or you know just
give me your feedback what videos do you
want to see from me in the near future
so yeah thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye
