this makeup right here and this had to
be a voiceover unfortunately because
when I film this I was still trying to
get over my cold but it's a really
intense look and it's perfect for a New
Year's Eve so the first thing I'm going
to do is take my Urban Decay primer
potion and I'm going to be putting this
all over my lids as my primer then I'm
taking some tape putting it on the back
of my hand a few times and then putting
that on the side of my eye to create a
cat eye effect and then taking my NYX
jumbo eye pencil in black bean I'm going
to put this on my lid and then blend it
out with a brush and I'm not going to be
taking this past the crease I'm going to
take Mac's quark eyeshadow and I'm going
to be using this to blend this color
into my crease this look takes a lot a
lot of blending a lot of dedication and
blending it's just you got to really
blend these colors into the crease this
is what's going to make it look nice and
smoky and blown out I'm going to take
this color right here it's all from Mac
and it's called brown down and then with
a more precise blending brush I'm going
to be putting this like directly into
the socket of my crease and then
blending it up to get it again like
blown out and more smoky I'm going to go
back and forth between blending brushes
and make sure that it's nice and blended
now I'm taking the showstopper of this
tutorial and it is this pigment called
utopia it is by makeup geek and it is
amazing so I'm going to spray fix+ on my
brush then dip it into the cap and then
start patting this on my lid the fix+
really makes a difference with this
eyeshadow it just makes it look for old
and metallic and so intense and I'm
obsessed with it so I want to get it
really precise right up to my crease and
I'm not going to take it past there this
is going to be like a glittery mess if I
do then I'm taking that Brown down color
again and I'm going to start blending
some more like I said it's just a lot of
crease blending this is just the tricky
part of the whole tutorial is just
really getting those crease colors and
blends it out so just go back and forth
and I really take my time with this
now I'm taking max to shroom as my brow
bone highlight and my inner corner
highlight as well then I'm taking my
Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
Midnight master and I am tight lining
with this and also putting this all over
my waterline for my eyeliner I'm using
the NYC liquid eyeliner and I'm doing a
very thin line because I really want the
glitter and the pigment to really stand
out so I'm just doing it very thin then
I'm taking Mac's carbon on a very very
small shader brush and I am putting this
in my crease very precisely this is kind
of like a soft cut crease because it's
not it's not a full-blown cut crease
it's not as dramatic as a cook crease
but kind of like the same concept where
I'm just really putting it into the
crease very precisely so I just go back
and forth and I blend that out that's
why I'm fast-forwarding this because if
not this video would be like 45 minutes
long it's just a lot of blending like I
have said 50 times already I'm just
taking off the tape and then cleaning
around my eye
I'm going to take brown down and smudge
that underneath my lower lashline and
then kind of I'm out of the frame I know
I'm terrible but I'm just softening up
the edge of that cat eye because I don't
want it too sharp and then I'm taking
cork by Mac and I'm doing the exact same
thing now I'm just going on my mascara
I'm using my Wynn and Wild mega volume
and my Jordana best lash extreme and I'm
just packing on this mascara you totally
could use false lashes I think that
false lashes would look beautiful for
this look but you know me guys I'm not
really a false eyelash wearer but you go
ahead and go on with your bad self if
you do I have primed my face with my
L'Oreal True Match Lumi primer and then
I'm taking my Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation and putting this all over my
face this is perfect for New Year's Eve
because it photographs beautifully
I'm taking my mac pro longwear concealer
and I'm using this to cover my dark
circles and to brighten underneath my
eyes this is also a perfect concealer
for New Year's because it lasts all day
and it does increase and it doesn't cake
and it's perfect for that then I'm
taking my Mac MSF natural - just set
that concealer
I'm thinking my benefit hoola bronzer
and I'm using this to contour my face
and to bronze up my face a little bit
I'm not going to do like a super
dramatic like a contour but I do want to
chisel out my cheekbones a little bit
for this look now I'm taking the NYX
blush in the color mauve single took off
pretty sure and I'm just adding this
really lightly on my cheeks there's so
much going on in my eyes that I don't
want too much going on on my face then
I'm taking my Mac mineralize skinfinish
insulting gentle as my highlight I'm
taking my angel lipstick and then I'm
going to top it off with NYX butter
gloss in creme brulee as per usual I
love this gloss and that completes the
look thank you so much for watching guys
please subscribe you have no right and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
