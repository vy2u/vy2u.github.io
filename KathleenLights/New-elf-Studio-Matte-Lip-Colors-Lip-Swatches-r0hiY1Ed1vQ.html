quick little swatches video not so much
a review no yes I guess you would call
this a review but recently elf came out
with three new studio matte lip colors
three additions to their collection they
had six colors in total and now they
have nine because they did add these
three amazing shades so today's video
I'm just going to be swatching them on
my lips for you and giving you like my
mini review they came out with these and
new beautiful colors for fall because
honestly all the other colors and this
little collection are very muted kind of
nudie type of colors except they're red
that red one obviously is Anna nude but
the rest of them are kind of nude shades
so I'm really excited that they came out
with three bolder colors health did send
me these three colors to try out I
actually wasn't expecting this um the
UPS man knocked on my door and I was
like I'm not expecting a package and
then when I opened the door I was like
oh my god I wasn't expecting this they
just send it to me to try out but I
wanted to do a video just in case you
guys wanted some lip swatches on the new
health studio matte lip colors actually
wasn't too too familiar with these I
only have one other color that I bought
myself and it is coral and I love this
color it is amazing but this is the only
one I own I've actually been interested
in getting some more and after trying
these I definitely want some more I
don't know if they reformulated it or
they change the formula or made these
extra creamy but these do not feel matte
or like super drying on the lips they do
have kind of a matte finish but I would
definitely say that there's some
creaminess to it because this one to me
dries completely matte on my lips the
coral one but these have like a creamy
texture to them and when you look at
them they're not like completely 100%
matte they're not glossy or shimmery or
anything like that but they're a very
creamy matte which actually really like
they're not drying on the lips and
they're really really really comfortable
to wear you guys know elf is a really
inexpensive brand and these retail for
$3 each super super cheap really quickly
I'm going to run by the colors
this one right here is called fuchsia
and what I really like about this is
that it is the perfect pink for fall
sometimes wearing bright pink lips is
something people would normally only
wear in the summertime but because it is
kind of like a berry type of pink like
it's a hot pink but a deep hot pink I
don't know how to explain it this would
be perfect for the fall if you are
looking for a nice pink dark lip to wear
in the fall time
this one is perfect I'm really glad that
they added this to their collection this
next one is called wine and it
definitely reminds me of the color of
wine because it is a little bit red but
it has a little bit of that berry
undertone in it as well it's like not
full-blown red I love it it's very very
pretty for the fall time it's like deep
and beautiful I really love this color
as well and I think a lot of people
would really like it and then the last
one is called cranberry it's the one I'm
wearing on my lips right now and it is
my favorite this is a really pretty red
color but there's a little bit of like a
brick Ness to it like a brick undertone
I don't know how to explain it but it
looks really really pretty on the lips I
absolutely love it these are not like
crazy crazy opaque like with one swipe
it's like whoa whoa color you do have to
build it up a little bit but I don't
find a problem with that another thing
they're really really easy to apply
because they come with a little pointed
tip so it was super easy for me to just
line my lips with it I didn't need to
use a lip liner I'm not wearing a lip
liner now I still always recommend using
a lip liner with darker colors that's
just me and obviously eventually this is
not going to have a pointy tip anymore
it will get round the more you use it
but the back piece right here is a
sharpener so that was my quick tiny
little review and lip swatches on their
new matte lip colors from their studio
line I think they're a great addition to
your already existing matte lip color
collection and if you have never tried
these out then I definitely recommend
them they're great so yeah that is it
thank you guys so much for watching
