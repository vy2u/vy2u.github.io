my Betsy Sherman box in saline the noise
the noise I think I'm putting this video
up on time last month it was like
October 30th and I was putting up my
boxycharm video but this month I'm
pretty sure I'm right on schedule
alright let's open this okay so this is
what the box looks the BOK the box this
one it looks like the theme is yeah
the theme is beauty party like a tea I
did see online that they were having
like an Alice in Wonderland theme they
had like really cool videos on Instagram
and then they also have this card in the
box it says 25% off your purchase on
Elle Elle the ex nail lacquer this is
the purely say prevent Blue Lotus
foreign one I adore serum does it's an
intensive hydration it firms it
brightens it decreases puffiness and is
for all skin types
I have heard of this brand before they
make like an amazing SPF like a
moisturizer and I'm pretty sure it's
like a very high-end brand so this is
what it looks like it's for your eye
eyes it's an eye serum and that told you
guys that's expensive it does I knew it
was high-end this is full-size and this
retails for $65 okay it says apply day
and night after cleansing works against
wrinkles dark circles and puffiness next
thing is this babe this is a blush from
the brand studio makeup it is their
blush in wildflower
this is will oh my god it's such a
beautiful color studio makeup soft blend
blush this a full-size blush and this
retails for seventeen dollars I'm
actually gonna put this on my face right
now I want to see how it looks
that's pigmented I mean I already had
blush on but I really really like this
color a lot it's very very smooth it has
like a really nice buttery texture it's
a matte I really I really like this a
lot
okay so moving on the next thing is this
guy right here
am I gonna love this brand this is luck
see this is a concealer brush I'm going
to assume let me write luck see rose
gold concealer I brush this is full size
and this is $12 I don't like these
brushes for concealer but I love these
for eyeshadow I know that that's weird
but color pop color pipe color pop
eyeshadows work really well with these
little concealer brushes like you get
more pigmentation so I like using this
for those kinds of things for pigments
for color pop eyeshadows I love these
kinds of brushes but not for concealer
so I'm still gonna use this I think I
already have this brush because I love
this brand Luxy brushes are amazing they
have really good brushes so yes that is
the other thing in the books okay two
more sings easy books this is from a
brand cool way we have gotten cool
weight in boxes before I think this is
the cool way leave-in treatment this is
a full-size product and it's 1995 that's
pretty expensive for something so little
spray generously on to dry or damp hair
and blow dryer style as desired what did
we get in the box that was from Kuwait I
know that I had given it to my cousin
but what was it I don't remember what
we've got him from cool way before but
anyway this is a leave-in treatment I
love leave-in conditioners I will be
giving this a shot I just purchased like
to leave in conditioners so I won't be
opening this yet but that's good hold
even conditioner I love hair stuff okay
and then the last the last thing in Z
books why am I talking about that this
is the last thing and this is from manic
adore I've heard of this brand I think
I've tried a couple things that I really
really like them this is their lip
locked priming gloss stain the latest
innovation in lip stains smooth
application keeps lips hydrated with
pigment that lasts four hours this is a
full-size product and this retails for
$24
oh that's pretty it kind of looks like
I'm wearing Lumiere bicolor Papa the
flippy thing I created with color prop
but I'm wearing just the lip pencil I'm
not wearing the lippy stick but this
kind of looks similar I'm gonna put it
on top but like a minute I can't see I'm
just using the view this is such a
beautiful color it goes really well
really well with Lumiere lippie pencil
it feels really moisturizing and
hydrating ooh
hopefully it lasts all day I mean it is
a lip stain so I'm gonna assume it will
and it goes really well with the blush
they like pair really nicely together I
really love these two things these two
things are definitely my favorite things
in the box
so yes that is everything I got in the
box I really loved this lip color that
is everything now let's add up the value
so the overall value of the box was over
a hundred and thirty five dollars I
highly highly recommend but see shame
it's actually boxycharm oh wait color
box a sure I'm here on my channel
I love boxycharm I think it's an amazing
deal like you get so much for your money
I think it's great so I really loved the
blush and the lipstick this month this
month those are definitely my favorite
things let me know what you liked in the
Box like did you enjoyed this month was
this month and for you let me know leave
