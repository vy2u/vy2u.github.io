my foxy Sherman batts I'm doing it again
I'm doing it again it is midnight and
this video has to go up in nine hours
the month has literally flown by I had
no idea today was November 17th like the
month is almost over and I hadn't posted
my box of Sheeran video yet and I got
the box a few days ago and I was like
that's it I have to get this video up by
Friday and Here I am on Thursday night
but you know what I'm gonna do
everything in my power to edit it as
soon as I'm done filming it and it's
going up at 9 a.m. if you are not
watching this at 9 a.m. I have failed
you besides the fact that I am extremely
sleepy we're gonna jump into this box I
have been such a mess this week I
promise to be more on my game next week
it's just one of those weeks you know
you guys you guys have those weeks
sometimes or you're like what's my name
where am i standing so the fact that I
have half my makeup done huh I almost
dropped this I have half my makeup on so
obviously that means I'm gonna try out
these products as I go so this is what
the box looks like this month
the theme is groovy town so the first
thing in the Box is this little guy or
big guy this is pure marula facial oil
from the brand Marilla and marula oil is
actually one of my favorite oils I would
say it's at the top of my list next to
jojoba and Argan I really really love
marilla oil it comes in this really
really beautiful bottle I'm gonna give
this one to my mom because I have like a
million marula oils
I know Rosita Applebaum was just
recently talking about this specific oil
and she was talking about how she loves
it for hydration and how she uses it
right before bed and I agree I love me
some Merlot this is a full-sized product
of course and this retails for $58 yes
that's expensive it is that's spent but
that's also really good the next thing
in the Box is this guy this is a makeup
geek blush I haven't opened like the
actual I don't even know what color this
is heartthrob oh my gosh I bought these
color I already have these cool can we
talk about how excited I am that they
included a full-size makeup geek blush
in their box this month I mean these
retail for $10 so they're not like
extremely expensive but their makeup
geek and they're so good very
high-quality I'm gonna go look for my
heartthrob so I could apply it to my
cheeks so you can see it because I think
I'm gonna give this blush to my friend
Melissa
in the other room right now painting her
nails so this is my personal makeup geek
heartthrob blush I love it only of
course you get the depotted version not
the actual compact but you can just
throw the pan and a Z palette and there
you go so I'm going to take a little bit
on this stippling brush is the morphe
m-46 2 and pop some of that on my cheeks
it's a really really pretty peachy
natural-looking pink but it's not too
pink so the next thing in the box is
actually a brush this looks like a
pencil brush
I haven't actually opened it let me see
what brand is this oh this is from the
brand crown brushes it's a really I was
gonna say pretty yeah this is a very
pretty pencil brush it's a really nice
pencil brush like I can just tell it
even has a little dip right here so you
could hold it even though this feels
really awkward this is the crown brush
c-51 3 pro detail crease brush oh it's a
crease brush so maybe that's a pencil
brush but whatever I guess it would be
good for a cup crease which reminds me
side note completely complete side note
nothing to do with this video I get
asked all the time to do like cut
creases and my tutorials but I gotta be
honest I've never even tried to do one
but I have like this fold right here
that when I open my eyes I feel like it
would be impossible to have a cook
crease I don't know it's like really
weird anyway I'm gonna use this now with
the eye shadow palette that's in this
box cuz you know I already picked oh
this is a full size brush I'm all over
the place and this is $12.99 so the next
thing in the Box is this guy and this is
what I was most excited for I knew this
was gonna be in the box cuz you know I
opened it prior to this video but this
is the studio makeup on the go palette
and a couple months ago I want to say it
like two months ago boxycharm featured a
studio makeup palette and it was so good
it was more like a warm toned bronzy
eyeshadow palette this one is a more
smoky cooler version it's called the
cool down palette look at these colors
how pretty I don't typically go for
shades like this but when I saw it I was
like oh my gosh that is a beautiful
palette there other palette was really
good so I expect this to be good oh nice
look a day that's beautiful Oh
oh yeah those are the last three shades
right they're not the best watches this
palette retails for a forty-nine
ninety-five by the way so that is
amazing that we are getting it in the
box I'm going to take a little fluffy
crease brush with this middle matte
shade right there but in my crease I'm
going to use that same shade but with
the crown brush pencil brush I'm gonna
run that underneath my lower lashes this
brush is so so soft
I'm gonna take this color right here on
a smaller crease brush and I'm gonna
focus that on the outer corners color
does have a sheen to it but I don't
think it looks bad I think it looks
really pretty it's not like a glittery
eye shadow so it doesn't look bad in the
crease mm-hm
where I stopped from dontoh Tenten
Tennant is that I Dream of Jeannie don't
doesn't how do I not know where that's
from oh my god this guy's drive me crazy
same eyeshadow and I'm going to focus it
this time on the outer corners of my
lower lashline now I'm going to take the
matte purple shade and I'm gonna do the
same thing only I'm not going to really
drag this color in the crease I just
want to add a little bit of purple right
on the outer corners I love how these
eye shadows are blending I can't get
over how soft they are and how well they
blend I mean the shades that I've used
so far don't quote me on the entire
palette adding a little bit of purple
under here we're pretty much copying the
lid now I'm going to take this light
pinky shimmery shade and I'm going to
apply this on the inner half of my
eyelid was the Marin your way the entire
time I'm sorry and then I'm going to use
this shade right here as my inner corner
highlight and then this shade as my brow
bone highlight hopefully it's not too
pink she's too pure to be pink and then
I'm just going to take my finger and I'm
going to dip it into this glittery shade
right here and I'm just gonna apply some
right on top give it a little bit of a
glittery
and then lastly I'm going to take this
charcoal grate and I'm going to run this
on my lower lash line towards the outer
corners it's gonna make it look a little
bit more smoky okay so really quickly
I'm gonna apply some mascara some face
highlight and I'll be right back so I'm
really impressed with this palette I
think you get a lot of really pretty
colors they were all really pigmented
really easy to work with there's only
one color I didn't use it was this one I
used all the colors oh my gosh it was
such a fast simple look but I think it
came out really pretty and natural and
I'm not really a cool tone eyeshadow
lover but I love this palette definitely
my favorite thing in the box and then
the last thing we have to try is this
guy right here and this is from
bellapierre cosmetics and it is the kiss
proof lip cream and this is in the shade
antique pink I hate these things it
claims to be a full coverage high-impact
liquid lipstick that lasts for hours
without the need to retouch and it's
supposed to dry to a completely matte
finish this is definitely an on-trend
color like I feel like people would
really really like this shade oh my gosh
this smells so good it smells like
strawberries oh I love it
my lips are so dry right now so this is
what the shade looks like it definitely
dries much darker than it looks in the
tube at least on me this kind of looked
like a rosy nude but on my lips it's
reminding me a lot of Stila patina mixed
with Kat Von D's Lolita I think the
color is so beautiful I'm not exactly
sure how I feel about the formula of
this liquid lipstick though as I'm
pressing my lips together I mean it's
still not completely dry yet so maybe I
have to give it a minute but it's kind
of sticking together it doesn't transfer
that's always a plus the more dries the
less sticky it's getting nice I like
this is a full-size liquid lipstick and
this retails for $20 so I did the math
and the overall value of this month's
box was a hundred and fifty dollars
which is madness
like there has to be something wrong
here that's crazy so I am extremely
impressed with this month's box I think
it was awesome boxycharm now ships to
Canada if you didn't know uh yeah
I think that's all I had to say leave me
a comment down below if you liked the
box this month if you hated it oh yeah
