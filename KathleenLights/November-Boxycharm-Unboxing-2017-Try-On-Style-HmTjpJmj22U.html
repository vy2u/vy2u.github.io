mob X's Sherman Backson I am filming
this video at 11:42 p.m. and I have to
get this video up tomorrow
preferably tomorrow morning obviously I
don't know how that's going to happen
but let's see if it does chances are I
will go up tomorrow afternoon ish late
afternoon most likely anyway how are you
guys I feel like I haven't spoken to you
in forever because my last couple videos
have been pre-recorded because I went to
Vegas just got back and I'm ready to
make some videos I'm like so inspired in
my mind I have so many tutorials I want
to film anyway without further ado let's
get into the box you sherm so what the
box looks like this month
the theme is sweater weather I love
sweater weather and the first thing
we're gonna be looking at in today's box
is these things this is the can see
beauty all natural collagen and fused
lip mask it's an innovative jelly mask
for your lips that hydrate moisturize
and plump your pout
with natural ingredients I'm very
excited I'm all about this I actually
have very dry lips at the moment I'm
used to all of this humidity here in
Miami so whenever I go to non humid
places my lips turn into like little
crusty things a pack of 3 is $15 so I'm
gonna trade this on right now excuse my
hair by the way mom I have to wash it it
just says applied to clean lips for a 15
to 20 minute 15-20 minutes
you see 1146 I have to edit this video
all right we're just gonna do 15 minutes
it's all natural no parabens no sulfates
no artificial dyes or fragrance wait oh
man the things stayed in here okay hold
on I have collagen juice all over my
legs okay I'm just gonna
this is clearly for somebody with big
lips
am i putting it on the wrong way is it
this way alright my foundation is
completely off around my mouth
you just tap all that right in um I
gotta say I don't really notice a
difference in my lips I did feel a
tingling sensation towards the end there
Vic towards the ten minute mark I felt
like a little something on my lips so
I'm sure if you use this a couple times
a week or something you might see a
difference after you use this a few
times but $5 a little mask like I don't
know if it's worth I don't know if it's
worth it you know I am still gonna use
these other two lip masks sometime this
week but honestly this product was just
like an for me and plus it was like very
slippy it did not stay on my lips like I
kind of had to lean my head back a
little bit because it was kind of like
slipping off so the 15 minutes aren't
like the most fun all right and the next
thing we have is this bad boy this is
from the brand let see they make brushes
I really love this brand their brushes
are really good and this is their quad I
travel set I'm assuming this is a
collaboration with boxycharm because it
says a bugsy charm on the packaging and
this little set retails for $32 this is
what they look like you get kind of like
a flat liner brush a regular all-over
shadow brush you get this slanted brush
which is really nice for the outer
corners and getting right in the crease
there and then you get like a little
brush like this it kind of resembles
like a Mac 217 blending brush so these
are really really good and I am about to
use those brushes right now because
there's an eyeshadow palette in the box
this month so this is so cute look at
the packaging on this this is an
eyeshadow palette from the brand Winky
luxe it is their kitten palette it's
their kid in palette it has a
little pets on the cover and it comes
with nine eyes shadows this palette
retails for $25 so not too bad I've
never tried I shout outs from Winky Lux
before but they feel very very creamy
let's zoom in and try some of these out
on the eyes okay I'm gonna take this 213
brush I'm gonna take this eye shadow and
I'm gonna use this as a brow bone
highlight so because there isn't like a
big fluffy brush I'm gonna use one of my
own this is a morphe r37 and i'm gonna
pop this color in my crease by the way
if you hear the TV on I'm sorry my door
is closed but the TV is on super loud in
the living room right now I'm gonna take
the 227 pop on this color right here
okay I'm gonna go back into that first
shade we used I'm just gonna blend out
the harsh lines here okay so now with my
finger I'm gonna take this shade right
here it's been calling my name it looks
so pretty it's like look at that how did
that ease oh my good
I'm gonna go back into this 227 brush
with that same eyeshadow I was using
before and I'm just gonna blend
everything together all right now I'm
gonna take the 207 brush I'm gonna pop
on this purple shade right here I'm
gonna focus this like on the outer
corners towards my lash line
all right so I'm pretty much done with
the lid the only thing I don't like is
to fall out but you know what like
everything has fall out that's why I
always do my eyes before my face makeup
I'm gonna go in with the 213 brush on
that crease sure you used that peanut
butter trade taking the 227 brush and
this is a blending brush that's kind of
a fluffy brush so I'm only gonna take
this really lightly okay that got really
smoky now I'm gonna go into the 221
brush I'm gonna go into this purple all
right so I clean the dark eyeshadow off
of this angled brush and I'm gonna
highlight my inner corners with this
shade right here
I really like this brush for
highlighting my inner corners it's like
really intense this eye shadow is super
intense okay so now I'm gonna pop on
some mascara and I will be right back
all right so the next thing in the Box
is this this is from a brand called
Lakha yeah I'm gonna go with Lakha this
is the lacquer and Co cloud lips this
retails for seventeen dollars and it
says it's an airy matte lipstick that
provides full coverage but feels as
light as a cloud so oh I know those
that'll be a very dark color like this
okay so this is a very very pretty color
and it's just a little bit patchy but I
think with a really good lip liner
underneath this would look beautiful
because regardless I think this lipstick
needs a lip liner underneath because it
is a little bit harder to apply and once
you do that I feel like this color is
gonna be gorgeous I'm curious to know
what you guys think of it if you got
this in the box but let's just move
right along to the last thing in the box
not in peace and I was really excited to
see that we got this in the box this is
the cover FX illuminating setting spray
I have it anything feel like I have a
love-hate relationship with the setting
spray I think it's amazing because of
the mist literally the best mist ever
seriously you guys will see when you
spray this but there is glitter in this
you guys have to be careful if I'm
shaking it up so much because if you
don't do that you will have glitter all
over your face okay that is so fine
and the shimmer in this is what makes it
illuminating but when you're really
really shaken up like really really
shake it up it does look really
beautiful and illuminating and you don't
get those thick chunks of glitter but
yeah that is extremely exciting this is
a full-size product of course and this
retails for 31 dollars but yeah guys
that was everything I got in this
month's bathroom let me add it all up
let me grab my calculator alright so the
overall value of this month's box is a
hundred and twenty dollars a hundred
dollars more than what you pay for the
box basically basically yeah guys I
really enjoyed the box this month I was
pleasantly surprised by that eyeshadow
palette I love those brushes the only
thing I was like camera was the lint
mask like it was a good buck see sure
month let me know what you guys think in
the comments below though I'd love to
know your thoughts that completes this
video thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video
bye
I'm gonna go in with the two three I'm
gonna go into the third I'm gonna go in
with I'm gonna go ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
