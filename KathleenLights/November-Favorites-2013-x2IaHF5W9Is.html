November favorites and I do these videos
every month even if I don't have a lot
of stuff to show you I try to tell you
guys the things that I have been really
loving recently and if you hear somebody
screaming bloody murder that's Danny on
the Xbox by the way excuse my hair oh
this is a big bum what's this oh that's
my that's my bum good ok by the way
excuse my hair I was literally about to
jump in the shower and wash my hair and
get it all pretty and I realized that I
needed to film my monthly favorites
video so I literally just threw it up in
a bun and Here I am tell me the video
this month I didn't really do a ton of
shopping so it's not a lot of new stuff
but they're just things that I have been
reaching for the most like things that I
have been using non-stop and I cheated a
little bit a couple of these things I
got like a week and a half ago so that's
not really a November favorite but I
mean I started loving them in November
so that counts so my first favourites
are two haircare products and the first
one is the it's a 10 miracle leave-in
product this deserves all the hype it
gets it's amazing at first I thought
that it was just like a spray that I was
gonna spray a little bit like um like
watery in a way because the the fact
that it had like a little pump threw me
off but it is a very thick and
moisturizing cream which I think it's
awesome that it's in a spray bottle and
it's a cream but anyway it's supposed to
do ten things for your hair repairs dry
damaged hair hello and shine detangles
controls frizz steals and projects hair
color prevents violence stops hair
breakage creates silkiness enhances
natural body and it is also a thermal
protectant which is awesome because you
just hit yourself you just spray this
all over your hair and it's also your
heat protectant but this has made a
difference in my hair since I've been
using it I feel like my hair isn't as
damaged still pretty damaged but it
isn't as damaged as it was when I first
got my hair lighter so this has been
working wonder for me
is a little spensive but I think it's
worth every penny
the next haircare favorite is this bio
silk silk therapy now the story behind
this um I was talking to my supervisor
and I was telling her that I needed
something to make my hair really soft
and silky and for it to look like not so
dull and she was something that she uses
this all the time and she said it was
amazing and left her hair so shiny and
manageable and pretty and it really did
so she gave this to me because I was
super skeptical about it at first but it
is awesome it says that silk therapy is
a weightless leave-in silk replenishing
and reconstructing treatment to repair
smooth and protect all hair types I
can't stress enough how good this is
like this makes such a difference
instantly like I will put it on my hair
and my hair will look so shiny and so
soft I understand why a tote soak
therapy your hair feels like you're
touching silk it is it's insane I was
literally blown away I think I used to
use this years ago I know I used to use
the bio soap gel in high school and in
middle school and it was my favorite gel
of all time and yeah I really like
biosilk the things that I've used from
them have worked really good so this is
also another bio soap favorite I don't
exactly know all the places you can buy
biosilk but my supervisor gets her as I
have Marshalls or TJ Maxx one of those
because she says it's like 50 times
cheaper then if you get it like at a
salon or something so check your
Marshalls or TJ Maxx because they have
it for a lot cheaper there my next
favorite is a mascara that I have been
reaching for so much this month and it
is my l'oreal voluminous carbon black I
have been using my Jordana best lash
extreme a lot too but I've been using
this one the most in November and this
mascara is very hit-or-miss
with a lot of people because a lot of
people said that it's smudged on them
like crazy so immediately I only used it
on my top lashes I never use this on my
bottom lashes because if mascara does
smudge on me it's gonna smudge on my
lower lash line so I've been using this
on my top lashes only and I haven't
any smudging it is a very thick in
volumizing formula if you are not into
thick voluminous lashes you are not
going to like this it's it's thick it's
one of those mascaras that have the
fiber bristle wands as opposed to the
plastic ones which these are the ones
that I do prefer I think that they are
more volumizing than the plastic ones
and I like value so yeah I have been
really liking that mascara okay so
recently they opened up a Sephora
literally down the street from my house
and before that the closest support to
me was in another state so I never went
to Sephora so as soon as I found out
that they had opened this before there I
went nuts so honestly Sephora has become
like my new home
these past like three weeks like that's
I'm there all the time even if I don't
buy anything I'm just there touching
stuff so my next two favorites are both
things that I bought at Sephora and
they're both josie maran products and if
you watch my videos you know exactly
what i'm about to talk about and it is
the Josie Maran Argan and lou manizer
this is hands-down the best
highlight I've ever purchased in my
entire life it is the highlight I am
wearing right now on my face and down
the bridge of my nose not my cheekbones
and I'm just obsessed with it I love it
it is pretty much like a gold highlight
it is very gold if you're not into gold
highlights or champagne kind of
highlights this isn't for you it's
gorgeous and I honestly haven't used any
of my other highlights since I've
purchased this the only downside about
this product is that it pumps out way
too much product like even if you
concentrate and you try your best and
you're just squeezing it slowly like it
just like shoots out product and you're
like and staying on the Josie Maran
train this is the thing I was talking
about earlier when I said that um I had
bought this like a week ago so
technically I'm cheating but I've used
it every single day since I bought it
and it is the Josie Maran
100% pure argan oil this is an organic
moisturizing oil and oh my god you guys
know how dry my skin is okay I have
really dry skin why it didn't occur to
me before to buy this I don't know I
have been putting this on every single
night before I go to bed and in the
morning
I wake up my skin feels it feels like
brand-new skin extremely hydrated it's
incredible what a difference this is
made on the dryness of my skin my skin
feels sold like moisturize then happy
and it's weird because I haven't felt
like that in a long time okay so my next
favorite sour lip products of course I
wouldn't be Kathleen if I don't mention
lip products now would I
one of them is from the drugstore and I
have talked about this multiple times
but it is the covergirl LipPerfection
jumbo gloss balm in ballet twists I'm
mentioning this because it's literally
what I have been putting on my lips
almost every single day this month this
is what I had on my lips in a few videos
it was what I had on my lips and my
go-to
smokey eye that I posted last week or
something like that I have just been
using this non-stop it's just one of
those things that you just throw in your
purse and you put it on throughout the
day because it's so easy since it's in a
crayon you really can't mess up with
this like you don't need a mirror at all
and I can see why a couple of people
wouldn't like this because it does have
like some sort of a gold sheen just like
a very subtle gold Sheen when you put it
on your lips but I actually like it
because it makes my lips look pretty
glossy and it looks beautiful over nude
lipsticks it's so easy and it's just a
throw in your purse kind of thing and
everybody needs one of those throw in
your first kind of things right okay so
the next lip products are what I have on
my lips right now and I instagrammed a
picture of it a couple days ago and I
have just been obsessed with this
combination they're both from Mac and it
is a lipstick and a lip pencil the lip
pencil is in the color magenta and the
lipstick is in flat out fabulous this
came out with like the retro matte
collection which by the way is permanent
it's not limited edition this puppy is
not going anywhere when I went to go buy
this lipstick the lady said that the day
before they had got in 20 and they were
down to three or four something crazy
like that but honestly this lipstick is
so beautiful I love the finishes of
these retro matte lipsticks they're I
mean I love matte lipsticks like that is
my thing I love matte lips and this one
just looks so beautiful
what makes it extra beautiful to me is
this lip liner though this is like the
dynamic do
I love this lip pencil because it has
like a metallic purple finish you
probably can't tell in the little swatch
but it come it comes off like kind of
like a dual chrome on your lips it's
like super vibrant purple ink that's how
vibrant it is that it looks like it's
like two different kinds of purples I
don't know it's like so beautiful I
would wear this on my lips just on its
own because it's that perfect I love it
and then just let us take a pairing on
tapas like the finishing touches this
lipstick isn't like the exact same color
as the lip pencil this is a lot more
pink and this is a lot more purple I
don't know if you can tell in the
swatches but this is definitely more
pink so the little combination just
gives it the perfect pinky purple look
and I am pretty sure I'm gonna wear this
like all the time like okay so I've been
loving my bare minerals original powder
foundation I was really skeptical at
first because powder does not mix well
with dry skin I rarely use powder but I
heard that this gave you like the most
beautiful luminous glow and it wasn't
cakey and not powdery at all which it
isn't it's actually what's on my face
right now I just have like concealer in
certain areas and then I just buffed
this on my entire face and it looks
beautiful this isn't for someone who
wants coverage because it is a very
sheer very light coverage but it does
seem to blur your imperfections really
nicely I love the look it gives to my
skin when I use this and it is mineral
makeup which is so good for your skin I
am in the shade medium beige I don't
know if I mentioned that already but
that's my shade and I know that some
people wanted me to do like a video or
review on this if you still want to see
like how I applied this and stuff so
leave a comment down below and I will
deliver to you okay and my very last
favorite are my necklaces you guys know
how obsessed I am with my monogram
necklace to like an obnoxious degree I
wear it everyday
I hardly wear any of my jewelry like
sometimes a whirling earrings and stuff
like that but like my monogram necklace
is my life and recently I just got these
two necklaces I don't know why I'm
wearing both of them
the same time hmm but I am because I was
I was I just I love them so much so I I
just wanted to wear them both whatever
don't judge me
this one is just a beautiful little
wishbone necklace that I think it's just
so dainty and cute and this one is a dog
bone that actually has Cornelius's name
engraved in it
courteous is my dog by the way if any of
you guys were wondering and I really
just wanted to mention them because they
are from my pieces boutique which is the
boutique my sister owns my sister and
her best friend they they are my pieces
boutique and I just really wanted to
mention that because it would be awesome
if you guys can follow them on Instagram
they don't ship internationally at least
not yet because it's kind of like a new
thing that they've been doing so I don't
know if maybe in the future they will
ship internationally but as for right
now it's just the United States which is
really unfortunate I know a lot of you
guys that watch my videos are not all in
the United States but you know they just
started out so hopefully in the future
they can do that but yeah it would be so
nice if you just supported my sister and
followed the my pieces boutique on
Instagram I will put it here on the
screen tell you exactly how it's spelled
then you can just follow them on
Instagram that would just be lovely that
would make my day also follow me on
Instagram
if you don't already I will write that
right here too via all necklaces are
sterling silver they are not going to
get black they're not gonna make your
neck green and these gold ones are
dipped in real gold they're gold-plated
this is this is a real gold wash so it
is really amazing quality they also sell
clothes on my pieces boutique too by the
way that is where I got my monogrammed
necklace I get a lot of questions about
my Mohammed Graham necklace and it's
from my piece and boutique so go check
them out
