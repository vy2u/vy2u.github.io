my November favorites um I just want to
say a couple of things before I get into
the things I've been loving this month
one is all three of the beasts are in
this room today all three dogs are here
right now so if you're here like some
ruckus it's them it's Sunday football so
Danny's in the living room they are
crazy
Sammy's in the living room watching
football so they're in here with me
because he's like this and they could be
killing each other and he wouldn't
notice another thing is I feel like crap
like I really really feel like crap
there wasn't a video up on Friday and
that's just because and I were super
busy with like Thanksgiving new things
so I got all caught up and didn't
realize I didn't have a video for Friday
so I'm really sorry about that give a
tell you a quick little story I am
obsessed with hot cheetos it's like my
favorite bag of chips besides sour cream
and cheddar it's like I can eat hot
cheetos every day of my life and I kind
of have been for a while I have been
like binging on Hot Cheetos
for like two weeks like really scary
stuff and then at 2:00 in the morning
last night I felt like a huge burn in
the pit of my stomach
and TMI coming your way I threw up
nothing but hot red fire so I did throw
up last night and it was just pure hot
cheetos that's really disgusting but I
cannot look at a bag of hot cheetos
anymore had some in my cabinet and
almost barked again I just wanted to
tell you guys that because if I seem a
little bit like in this video it's
because I don't feel good and I wasn't
gonna film because I hate to film when I
feel bad but I need a video to go up
tomorrow because I can't miss a video on
Friday and Monday you guys would kill me
but since I feel like crap my hair is
just I had to put on a beanie or like a
little Scully thing which by the way
that's another favorite this month I've
been loving beanies I used to hate how
they looked on me but I kind of liked
them
now so I had to throw on a beanie
because there's a rat's nest in the back
of my head that you guys don't want to
see okay so now that I'm done with a
five-minute intro let's get on to the
things I've been 11 the first thing I
really have to mention is this because
I've been using it every single day
since I got it this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills tinted brow gel I have
mine in the shade brunette and I
freaking love this product I love it so
much more than I thought I would because
when I got it it's like glittery not
glittery but there's like a definite
sheen to it and I was like one but I
have been really really loving this
especially on days where I don't want to
put on a ton of makeup
I'll just throw on a little bit of
mascara under-eye concealer and then pop
this on my brows and I'm done and
sometimes when I don't want to wear
makeup at all I'll just throw this on my
brows and I feel like it's okay to walk
out of the house because I know it's
really strange but I feel like this is
gonna sound so weird but I feel like
when I don't fit in my eyebrows my
forehead looks even bigger than it
already is I know that seems kind of
strange but I always have to have
something on my brows and thank Jesus
above for this little product because it
kind of fills in the sparse areas since
it is tinted but then it sets your
eyebrows in place all day I do like it
on top of like an eyebrow product like
this but I prefer it like completely by
itself it's like a lifesaver I have
discovered probably like a Holy Grail
item seriously this month and it is from
the drugstore this is the Sonia Kashuk
eye on neutral matte palette this is
hands-down the bet it's really dirty we
this is the best matte palette I own
except for my it cosmetics matte palette
that I love the original but this is
such a great palette and you get 12 i
shadow for $20 $20 seems a little bit
steep for drugstore but it is Sonia
Kashuk it's really really good quality
these are the best most creamiest most
pigmented amazing matte eyeshadows in
the entire world like I can't I can't I
can
stress it enough I was actually blown
away like I was putting it on my face of
the first time when I was like like it
almost feels like a cream when you put
your finger in there it's amazing and it
has the best colors it has a black kind
of like a gray a purple all different
tones of brown warm Browns cool tone
Browns and then it has really light brow
bone shades it's definitely a staple for
any makeup lover in my opinion I highly
recommend it I got mine at Target that's
where they sell Sonia Kashuk but oh my
god it's the greatest $20 I've ever
spent in makeup seriously my next
favorite is what's on my lips and I have
been using this a lot this month and I
love it it is the girl lactic Beauty
matte lip paint the brand is girl lactic
it's their matte lip paint in the shade
demure she has like four or five I think
lip paints and this is the only one I
own it was it is the one that I think is
the prettiest out of all of them but I'm
sure they're all really gorgeous I love
the formula as well I love lip paints
like this where you kiss and like
nothing comes off that kiss but like
talk eat it doesn't come off it's one of
those things when you put it on it's
like a liquid first but then it goes
completely matte like super matte it
lasts forever on my lips and I love like
matte deep lipsticks I don't know I love
it highly recommend it this is a
high-end brand but you can besides girl
lactic calm you could also find these at
like really fancy Rite Aid's
okay now I'm gonna talk about more
eyeshadow so this month I've really been
loving to play around with different
eyeshadows I haven't been filming so
many tutorials and I don't know why I'm
definitely gonna be filming more
tutorials I've been like uninspired I've
been like in a rut lately with like
tutorials and stuff but I have been
playing like off-camera with a lot of
different eyeshadows so yeah I have
never tried these L'Oreal infallible
eyeshadows before because I thought they
were kind of expensive for drugstore
prices they're like eight dollars for
one eyeshadow which i think is a little
bit pricey but these are like pressed
pigments these are like literally like
pots of pigments like press pigments
they're amazing they're really really
good I only have two and I
we really have been loving bronze taupe
I have amber rush as well which is crazy
gorgeous but have been using bronze
taupe the most and I don't hear a lot of
people talk about this color but it is
so pretty it has a little stopper that
you want to keep in your eyeshadow but
this is what it looks like it's a bronze
color but it's a taupe bronze the name
is perfect it's a cool tone bronze which
is really nice this is actually like the
exact same color as the Maybelline Color
tattoo in bad to the bronze in like
powder version that's a cream this is
the powder when you layer those two with
each other this will last forever
like it won't come off your eyes these
infallible eyeshadows are so pigmented
and lasts like months it's crazy you can
even use this without a primer that's
how pigmented and like intense it is
it's really really top quality another
product that I've really been loving
that's affordable these are the color
pop super shock shadows and I have been
really really liking these too this one
is called on the rocks I've been loving
this one for a while now a little bit
more than no just November it's such a
pretty like brown copper color with
little specks of gold all throughout it
this looks so pretty all over the lid
with just like a brown in the crease and
mascara I don't know I really really
love this I think it's so fun it's
really nice for this time of year
because of the glitter in it I think
it's very festive and then this one is
new to their like Holiday Collection
this one is called partridge and it is
literally Mac's club eyeshadow you ever
seen max club it's like brown but in the
light it looks green this one reminds me
so much of it because it has that
duochrome
mist to it this next product is a blush
that I think everyone should own this is
NARS madly and NARS is a very expensive
brand but I think I have one other blush
besides this but this is quickly one of
my top 5 favorite blushes of all time
like including every brand madly
seriously became Holy Grail status after
I purchased it this is the blush I'm
wearing on my cheeks right now
I didn't go too crazy with it because I
didn't want to go too crazy with my
makeup today but it is the most
beautiful color I have ever seen on a
blush it's the kind of blush that looks
good on your face for every single day
but it also is like romantic and
feminine this is the blush I wore on
manniversary we went out to dinner and I
wear it on my anniversary and it just
gives such a nice romantic look it's
beautiful it's described as a seashell
pink on the sephora website and I mean I
guess when you swatch it you're like um
okay but when you put it on your cheeks
it's like a whole nother level I highly
recommend you check out madly if you
haven't okay more eyeshadow but I
promise it's the last I shadow product
day we'll be talking about these are elf
Prizm eyeshadow palettes I spoke about
this briefly in my ELF haul and I talked
about how much I love them but I have
been using the naked one non-stop like
these two perfect combination I don't
need any other eyeshadows they're
amazing because this doesn't have any
matte shades they're just straight-up
metallic amazing gorgeous goodness
everything is has a beautiful Sheen
they're very intense but they are so
beautiful and you would never think that
quality like this would come from ELF I
love um their baked eyeshadows and they
have certain eyeshadows that are really
good but these are like out of this
world so good I also have in the shade
sunset which is also really beautiful I
actually did a look using this purple
one the other day but the video was just
a little bit dark like the Sun was like
gone I mean it was just a little bit
dark towards the end so I didn't know if
I should post it or not if you guys
still want me to post it even though the
lighting is a little bit off let me know
it's a full-face drugstore tutorial and
I actually used these two palettes let
me know if you still want me to post
that and you would deal with the like
you know the lighting being off but I
highly recommend these I believe these
are ten dollars each which is a little
bit expensive for ELF but I so worth it
I would pay 20 dollars each because the
quality is that good my next favorite is
a primer this is the LA girls Pro primer
HD high definition
shadow primer this is what it looks like
it's just basically like a pen and it's
like a cream color pen thing very very
similar to the Milani shadow eyes that I
constantly use Porter Porter please
please don't eat that but they're a
little bit different this one is a
little bit creamier this one I feel like
can dry out my eyelids just a tiny bit
because I have super dry eyelids so this
one is a little bit creamier works a
little bit better with my skin type and
it is a warmer color this one reminds me
of Mac's painterly paint-pot and this
one reminds me of Mac's soft ochre but I
really like it because it keeps my
eyeshadows in place all day these dogs
okay so last Beauty favorite before I go
on to the random favorites I never do
random favorites but I want to mention a
couple things I'm I love this this is
the Tarte gifted mascara I got this like
for a 500-point perk thing it came with
a bunch of other Tarte stuff but this
mascara is really good when I first
tried it I was like no but once I let it
dry a little bit
I loved it it reminds me a lot of my
Clinique lash doubling mascara if you've
been watching my videos since the
beginning you know that this is my holy
grail mascara love it to death I
purchased many many many tubes of this
my favorite hand down and it reminds me
a lot of this it gives really good
volume and a really good length at the
same time without clumpiness so good I
used I do about two to three layers with
this just going to like that extra
ba-ba-boom I have a mixture of these two
on my eyelashes right now good stuff
okay so I want to mention these really
quick I never mentioned fashion things
but I really want to mention these these
are burgandy peep toe booties from
winter maybe I should just show you one
this is from the online store called
Windsor I had never shopped at that
store before but actually I saw Kendra
Atkins I don't know if you guys watch
your channel vlogs with Kendra she
posted like a Friday favorite type of
video and talked about these and I
bought it that same day like a X out of
her video
and then I purchased them because she
was holding them and I needed them so
badly they're so pretty they're actually
really really inexpensive they're like
28 or 29 dollars and they're really good
quality I've only worn them once so it's
not a monthly favorite but I did want to
mention it just in case you guys liked
it because I did still see it on the
website today I will link it down below
these exact shoes to see if maybe you
would like them that's the only reason
why I wanted to mention them because I
know I will get ton of use out of them
I've only won them once but they run
true to size and they're just really
really pretty I am loving this color
recently can you tell okay so my next
favorite I keep in here because I
haven't bought frames for it yet but
these are two pictures from the website
glam print I will link the website down
below so you can get these if you want
these because I have been wanting
something like this for so long for my
beauty room let me open this I have to
buy frames for them I don't want like
really pretty white frames and I haven't
bought them yet but this is what they
look like I got this one which is so
beautiful this is a bunch of makeup
brushes and I think it would look so
pretty on my wall and then I have this
one this is a the perfume Coco Chanel
which I don't own but I thought the
bottle looked really pretty and I
thought that these would look so nice on
the wall I have a bunch of different
pictures and you could also customize
like you could order to customize your
own picture like they have they have the
templates on the website I will link the
website down below because I've been
trying to find things that look just
like this on Etsy and I can never find
ones like gold or silver which is kind
of like my theme like gold and silver so
yeah just wanted to mention these okay
guys and my last favorite is super
random ah but I want to mention it comes
in this it came in this box right here
I'm sure I'm so excited I just really
wanted to show you guys this is the
YouTube silver play button that you get
when when you hit a hundred thousand
subscribers and I just recently got it I
know a lot of people complain that they
get theirs late I got mine pretty late
it's so cool that you two
kind of honors people who hit 100k and
then you get like a really big plaque
with a gold play button once you hit a
million subscribers which is crazy I
don't know if I will ever hit a million
but I just feel so accomplished and even
if I do hit a million which is a stretch
honestly but even if I do I think I
would appreciate this one so much more
because like I worked really hard to get
to 100,000 subscribers so I don't know I
thought it was just so beautiful I'm
gonna hang it up on the wall I just
wanted to share this with you guys and
tell you guys thank you because you guys
