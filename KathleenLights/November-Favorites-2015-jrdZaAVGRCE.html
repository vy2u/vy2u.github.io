my monthly favorites these are products
I have been loving in the month of
November I'm sorry that this video is
going up so late I always always always
religiously either post the last day of
the month or the first day of the
following month and look at the date I'm
way way late about you guys do know my
situation right now I don't want to get
into it because I have an update video
coming but anyway let's get onto the
products I've been loving so I have two
eyeshadow palettes that I really really
want to share with you guys because I
love them both so much I'm gonna start
with the more pricier one and this is
from a brand called Natasha de Nonna she
is a makeup artist that created her own
makeup line and I purchased this palette
myself I did get sent a few things from
them but I heard amazing things about
their eyeshadows that I decided to place
an order for it these hands down hands
down are the best i shadow z' i have
ever used in my entire life I like them
more than the makeup forever eyeshadows
and those were like right up here for me
these are just a smidge above that I
think I paid like $50 for this palette
and you only get 5 eyeshadows and it's
not the best packaging ever this doesn't
look very very luxury or high-end even
though it has a very high price point
but I think that when it comes to this
it's quality / packaging the eyeshadows
are so good that I look past like the
plastic packaging and I do think it's
worth the money I paid for it and I
don't regret it at all
and I wanted to get this one because I
don't have any eyeshadows that look like
this he has a ton of beautiful shades
but because they were so pricey I wanted
to get one that I didn't have any dupes
of I chose this really pretty silvery
green palette and this just says palette
number 9 she does have like um huge
palettes that are like $200 something
crazy like that but I think you should
definitely check these out if you're
willing to invest the $50 because
they're the best have these two on my
eyelids right now like mixed together
on my eyes this is what I have in my
inner corner this is like the most
intense beautiful shimmery inner corner
highlight and there's just no fallout
they feel almost creamy to the touch but
they are powder it's like the craziest
thing I don't know that the best
eyeshadows in the entire world
personally I think I haven't really
tried any of her matte shadows because
these are all shimmery so I'm not
exactly sure about those but I am highly
impressed with Natasha they don't
eyeshadows okay so now for a much much
much affordable price I have really been
loving the BH Cosmetics Carli bybel
palette you get 14 eyes shadows or if
you want to look at it you get ten eyes
shadows and four highlights but you can
use them all as eyeshadows and you could
even use these shimmery ones as
highlights you know the world is your
oyster I love this palette I think it
has such a pretty mix of colors because
you have your really warm or bronzey
shades which I like and then you have
your more like Mavi purple shades over
here like cranberry I haven't had it for
too long but I have been dabbling into
this highlight right here it's such a
pretty shimmery pink I love it and then
I have used a couple of the warmer
eyeshadows a few times and I just really
liked it and I believe this palette is
under $13 and it's just really really
good quality congratulations Carly
because it is really good I'm going to
talk about nail polish favorites I want
to give a huge shout out to the H &amp;amp; M
nail polishes these are so good guys
they're so incredibly good I've already
accumulated like six or seven of these
they're amazing I love the brush on
these nail polishes because they're a
nice like chubby brush they get my
entire nail in just one swipe I hate
tiny tiny tiny little skinny brushes I
like them fat and juicy
besides the brush the formula is
actually really nice I haven't found one
that I don't like so far these two are
some of my favorites this one is called
witching hour it's such a dark dark like
for screen
perfect for this time of year and then
honestly this is like the epitome of the
perfect mauve nail polish this one is
called sepia it's beautiful it's not too
purple mauve it's a nice blush color
that's what it is it's a beautiful blush
color these are so creamy I do use two
coats but some of these you can get away
with just using one coat they're that
good there that'll pick through that
creamy around $5 I really love them I
also want to give a shout out to this
guy right here this is the Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure nail polish in
the shade yummy am I like that name it's
the nail polish I am wearing right now
it's much darker on the nails and then
it comes off in the bottle but I still
like it anyway it is literally like such
a pretty camel color looking at it on
the nails it looks identical to a max
eyeshadow in uninterrupted it looks like
Bobby Brown camel or makeup geek desert
sands like that kind of nail polish it's
so so pretty and out of all the nail
polishes I have in my entire collection
OPI Essie Deborah Lippmann out of all of
them the salon manicure line from Sally
Hansen is my favorite it's the one that
lasts on my nails the longest out of any
brand I've ever used
they're amazing I love them okay so last
nail product it's not a nail polish but
it is something that has completely
transformed my nails and it is this
little guy right here it's from the
brand nail teks and it is their formula
two plus this was a recommend nation
based on you guys I talked about how I
had really really pili nails and how my
nail polish just chipped the next day
because my nails were so peeling on the
bottom and I was using nail tech for a
long time it's like the nail tech
formula 2 I think it's also called that
and it was working really well but a lot
of you guys were telling me try the nail
teks version nail tech is like a dupe
for it to try the original because it's
a lot better and it is it is a lot
better it's a lot smaller and more
expensive but it really has transformed
my nails my nails are not peeling at all
anymore like 100% non peeling I love
this I use this as a base coat and then
I go in with my nail polish and then a
topcoat this is amazing
so my next favorite is the blush I'm
wearing and when I did my dupes video
this again was another recommendation
from you guys you guys you feed into my
makeup addiction when I did my dupes
video I talked about how much I loved
the Milani baked blush is but I had
never tried this one and a lot of you
guys told me to pick it up and this is
in the shade berry amore this is what it
looks like it is stunning I never wanted
to get it because for some reason I
thought it would look too dark on me but
I actually really like it it's the blush
I'm wearing right now on my face I heard
that this is kind of like a dupe for
Mac's warm sole I personally don't think
it's that similar I think warm soul is a
little bit peachy err like a little bit
more warm this one is a little bit more
pinky berry but it still has like that
warm soul feeling so I told I totally
understand it's beautiful this goes with
almost anything I almost love it as much
as I love luminoso and I love Luminoso
it's my favorite but this one is so
beautiful like it doesn't have any
chunks of glitter even though they it
looks like it does it doesn't come off
on the cheeks it's so pretty and it goes
with so many things it's a great great
blush and thank you to all of you who
recommended it ok so my next favorite I
have to talk about because I feel like
everybody needs to own this brush this
is the Sigma soft angled contour brush
it is the f23 when I first saw Sigma
release this I knew that I wanted it so
bad because it reminded me a lot of a
Chanel brush I have been wanting forever
but I haven't purchased because like
Chanel is like expensive very and it's
so similar to this I think it is a
little bit bigger but it has like the
same shape it's like this angled
beautiful beautiful brush I was so
excited to get this in the mail this has
made contouring so fun for me I don't
know because of its angle I contour my
cheekbones perfectly but it's not a
harsh chiseled intense contour sometimes
I'm into that look but sometimes I want
it to look more natural most of the
times and this brush does it for me it
just gives you such a nice blended soft
contour it's amazing I highly recommend
this brush it's so good ok moving on to
my next favorite I want to talk about
face products really quick
and I love this so much this is the
pixie glow mist you can find pixie at
Target this has a propolis I don't know
if I'm reading that correctly propolis
and argan oil it says it is nourishing
and hydrating what instantly drew me to
this is the fact that it has argan oil
in it and the fact that it's like an
actual oil I mean obviously because it
has argan oil in it but it looks
incredibly oily in the little bottle and
of course for someone with really oily
skin you're like whoa get that away from
me but with me I was all about it love
this I haven't used too much I've been
using it for like the past two weeks
it's so good if you have extremely dry
skin I highly recommend this personally
this is the closest thing that comes to
the tachi luminous dewy skin mist that's
like $52 this is much cheaper than that
and it doesn't quite moisturize my face
the way that the tacho undoes the
torture one is better but this one is a
great alternative I have this underneath
all of my makeup today I used it as a
base to have my skin look nice and glowy
and I have a lot of highlight on but the
glow factor within also comes from this
I don't think you would like this if you
have oily skin maybe you would I don't
know but it's really really glowy it
says all of our face mist for a glowing
luminous and smooth complexion enriched
with 13 natural oils plus propolis aloe
vera and fruit extract extracts I love
it and I highly recommend so every time
I go to film a video I just pop on my
makeup ever face and body foundation
because it's the one I have in my like
makeup bag at the moment but I cannot
deny the fact that when I'm not using
that one I am using this one this is
also from Make Up For Ever and it is
their Ultra HD invisible cover stick
foundation when I saw makeup ever
releases I was like oh that is a
foundation I am staying far away from
because stick foundations personally
just do not work for me because of my
my skin every stick foundation I've ever
used looks incredibly cakey on me no
matter what
it just looks thick and heavy and then I
don't know something inside of me told
me to buy this so I did and it's amazing
it does not look cakey on my skin it's
the foundation I'm wearing right now and
it's the first thick foundation that I
can say leaves a nice natural almost on
the verge of like dewy finish personally
for me because my skin is so dry it's
not dewy on me it's more of like a
natural satin finish but it's beautiful
I would say that this is like a flat
medium foundation a lot of people say
it's like full coverage I think it's
like a nice medium coverage which I like
and it's just it's so so good it's so
easy you just take this thing off and
just like swipe it on your face and
blend it in it's amazing you don't have
to blend right away which is what I like
I take the time and I put it on my
entire face I get my flat top kabuki and
then I buff it in some stick foundations
you have to work with immediately
because it dries so fast not this it's
so easy to work with I'm going to go
ahead and stay on the face subject and I
have to I have to give this a mention I
haven't been using this for a full month
yet but I have been using it non-stop
since my video this is the Nivea men
sensitive post shave balm I know it's
really weird because this is a men's
product but I use this as a primer for
my face before I apply my makeup and
nikkietutorials gave me that idea just
like just like she gave that idea to
like a million other youtubers she's
awesome but this is awesome too I was
truly shocked at how well this made my
makeup last throughout the day I did a
whole video on it I will link it down
below where I applied it to one side of
my face and then I went about my day and
the side where I applied this just
looked so much smoother my bronzer was
on at the end of the day and it was not
like splotchy it was intact while the
other side where I had to make up
forevers primer was splotchy so this was
like five dollars I bought this at
Publix for like five bucks it is so good
I would recommend getting the sensitive
one because
the normal one has like that super
strong man scent
this one is a very faint scent and it
hasn't broken me out or clogged my pores
it is truly a fabulous primer for five
dollars it's insane
okay so I have a lot of lip products to
share with you guys so I'm going to save
that to the end of the video I have one
more thing to share with you before I
get into the lips this fellow does
everything and more this is the Becca
Jacqueline Hill champagne glow palette I
purchased this myself for some reason I
want to throw that out there because
Becca did send this to me but they sent
it to my the wrong address they sent it
to my previous home and they were gonna
send it to me again but I couldn't I
couldn't wait I just bought it this is
what it looks like I love the packaging
it has a huge mirror I use ass mirror a
lot to do my makeup like what I'm
sitting on the floor of this house since
I don't have a room and it's a great
mirror it's really big I love that they
included that but basically what's in
this palette is champagne pop which is
the highlight Jacqueline Hill created
created created and then you have
blushed copper over here which is
something that they came out with that
was limited edition I don't know if it's
still available I don't think so but
blush copper and then they have this bad
boy over here which is their newest
highlight that will be permanent they
are coming out with a full-size of this
and it will be permanent and it is in
the shade pearl and I specifically want
to talk about pearl is so beautiful I
know a lot of people don't like white
highlights but I think unfair skin it's
in it's insanely gorgeous I'm wearing
pearl right now it is that is the only
highlight I have on my face pearl I love
mixing these two together champagne pop
and pearl look so nice mixed and then
this is a great blush like a nice blush
topper or a really really pretty
eyeshadow I use all three of these
colors and I think the whole palette is
worth it oh my gosh is this available am
i talking about this and this sold out I
am Not sure I hope it's not sold out and
if it is I'm sorry I have seven the
product to share with you guys and only
three of them are liquid lipsticks I
know you thought also we're gonna be
liquid lips
didn't you but no just three first one I
want to talk about is from colour-pop
and it is their lippy stick in the shade
ruffle this is such a beautiful warm
brown I feel like I don't have anything
that looks like this it's stunning and
the crazy part is that it looks so much
prettier on like I love it
swatched but I love it on I had gotten
this in the mail and I thought that they
were all beautiful till I saw a shade
from that girl Shea she likes watched
all of them on her lips and ruffle
looked insane on her it looks so
beautiful that it inspired me to like
pull it out and I have been using it
non-stop since I saw her where it's
speaking of a Browns I have been using
brown lip liner with pretty much
everything I even talked about Mac
chestnut in my last month's favorite I'm
still unlike the brown lip liner kick I
put it under like everything but I have
discovered this guy right here because
I've been using Mac lip liners in brown
recently and I wanted like a cheaper
alternative and I bought this and I
loved it this is the NYX slide on glide
on stay on and definitely a turn-on
waterproof extreme color lip liner how
does a longest name a lip liner has ever
had and this is in the shade urban cafe
it's a beautiful dark brown really
similar to Mac chestnut or a bittersweet
one of those shades it looks so pretty
underneath so many lipsticks so I wanted
to give this little brown guy a
shout-out because if you've been wanting
brown lip liner but don't want to spend
a lot on a lip liner this one from NYX
is awesome okay so moving back to color
pop this is crazy because I mean I've
owned this for a really really long time
but I have been using it non-stop
recently this is the Lumiere lip pencil
you guys know Lumiere is my favorite
color pop lipstick because I created it
and I love Lumiere but I love the lip
liner
so much like I love the lipstick and the
lip liner both both but I think I like
the lip liner just a little bit more I
just love how it looks it looks
incredibly matte on the lips I have been
wearing this and this alone for a while
I was wearing this in my boxycharm
unboxing video this month just this by
itself I love it not only is it great to
pair under like a bunch of Mavi nude
shades it's so pretty on its own so I
have been using my Lumiere lip pencil a
lot
I love it and and the perfect
combination the perfect
Lumiere lip pencil topper is this guy
right here I got this in my boxy charm
this month and it's amazing it's made me
really really want to play around with
lip gloss more because I'm all about
that matte lip obviously you guys know
I'm so into liquid lipsticks I don't
care what anybody says I love them but
after receiving this in the mail I'm
like into glossy lips this is the Amana
khadar lip stain and shade lucky this is
pretty much like the Lumiere lip pencil
in like a super super super glossy
formula it's so amazing and the fact
that it is a lip stain it stays on my
lips for a really long time it doesn't
dry matte it stays really shiny and
really glossy it's not a liquid lipstick
so it doesn't last the entire day but it
lasts a good amount of time and it just
makes your lips so juicy Thank You
boxycharm for putting this in my box
this month because it is good okay then
the last three things I want to share
with you are liquid lipsticks the first
one I have to talk about this is the
Stila stay all day liquid lipstick in
the shade by sea I want to say the ACI
I'm probably stupid for not being able
to pronounce a four-letter word but I'm
gonna go with bossy came in there like
eternally yours liquid lipstick kit or
the other one I'm not exactly sure I had
to buy mine on the Sela website because
I couldn't find it on Sephora anymore
but I hope I hope and pray that they
make this color permanent because it's
one of my favorite liquid lipsticks in
the entire world I have about a million
of them and instantly this is like top
five for me I don't know it's beautiful
there might be like a million shades
that look just like this but I feel like
when I put it on it looks unique to me I
was wearing this in my huge Sephora haul
so you can go ahead and see it it was
like my vib sale ha I'm wearing this and
this alone and I freaking love it the
next one I want to talk about is this
guy right here this is the dose of
colors liquid lipstick in the shade beer
with me I purchased this instantly when
I saw it they released this dose of
colors is my favorite liquid lipstick
ever oh top three top three definitely
one of the
as formulas in the entire world so every
time they come out with a new collection
or they release a new liquid lipstick I
buy it like I buy it I love it it's
amazing and this one is such a pretty
everyday nude but with a little bit of
pink like it's not too pink I don't know
how to explain it but it's beautiful
it's stunning I love it love it love it
and then the last thing I want to talk
about is this guy right here I haven't
had this for that long but it is so
beautiful this is the colour-pop ultra
matte lip in the shade of stingray this
is the collaboration they did with it's
my ray-ray she's so pretty just wanna
throw out that she's so pretty and this
is so pretty I wanted to give a shout
out to this because not only is it
really good but it is an exact almost an
exact dupe maybe a little bit different
then the jeffree star liquid lipstick in
the shade and drogyny that is like sold
out everywhere you can get a similar
color for like six dollars instead
stingray and it's so beautiful it's
listen I don't know what they did but I
feel like color pop definitely changed
their formula to like their newer liquid
lipsticks because I wasn't a big fan of
them when I first got them I liked them
and I would use them but some of them
would get too dry I had an issue with
some of them not all of them but I did
have an issue with some of them the
newest ones that I've been recently
getting haven't given me that problem
like for example I'm wearing platform on
my lips right now it's like one of their
new liquid lipsticks and I've been
wearing this for a while and it's
amazing what they don't they just they
don't transfer at all they're like ultra
matte it's crazy and I feel like their
formula has gotten better so stingray is
definitely a new favorite it's really
beautiful so that completes this video I
hope you guys enjoyed please leave me a
comment oh look para a pot it came to
say hello but potable why doesn't my
powder my pot oh oh with my baby please
