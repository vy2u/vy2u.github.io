my November favorites these are products
I have been loving in the month of
November and I have to be honest I feel
like I've been saying this every month
but I don't have that many products to
share with you guys today I don't know
what's up with me I'm dealing with a lot
of stuff in my personal life past few
months have just been filled with so
much anxiety and so much stress that has
nothing to do with YouTube or have
anything to do with work it's a lot of
personal things so a lot of the times I
haven't even been wearing makeup it's
been like a bumpy month and I feel like
it's been that way for a few months now
and I don't know hopefully things get
better but when I have been wearing
makeup these are the products I have
been using I'm gonna try to make it a
point to use a lot more makeup in the
month of December and really test out
more products I really feel like I need
a change in my life in the sense of like
my channel I want to do more things I
also want to incorporate more fashion
videos on my channel really want to
focus on my channel in 2017 that is a
huge goal of mine
I feel like recently I've been letting
my personal life get in the way of my
youtube life and that cannot happen I
don't know things have just been really
weird for me but I'm gonna bust out of
my funk and we're gonna talk about my
favorite products of November happy
thoughts good stuff so the first thing I
want to talk about is actually a mascara
that I have been using non-stop and at
first I didn't like this on my top
lashes but now it's like all I've been
wearing this is the trish mcevoy a high
volume mascara in jet black I purchased
this on Amazon it was a recommendation
from makeup by Tiffany D here on YouTube
I believe this is like one of her
favorite mascaras and I really wanted to
try it because she said it was a tubing
mascara which if you don't know what
that is basically tubing mascaras
they're really cool they cool your
lashes kind of like with a gel
consistency but I wouldn't say gel I
don't know how to explain it but when
you go to wash it off they come off in
like little tubes they look like tiny
little spider legs that are just coming
off of your lashes and it makes it so
much easier to remove because you don't
have all that running black mascara you
don't have a black eye it's not smudgy
it doesn't go everywhere it's the best
when you want to take it off it just
comes off so easily and I'm someone who
hates to remove mascara I don't know is
that a thing I really really really
dislike taking my mascara off at the end
of the day but with this mascara it's so
easy to just come off in
little tubes there's no mess involved
and I actually think it's one of the
best no no it's the best tubing mascara
I have ever tried a lot of them are
really good but they leave your lashes
very natural-looking I like a lot of
volume to my lashes and most to many
mascaras just give me just not enough
feel like this gives me enough I'm
wearing it on my top lashes today and on
my bottom lashes this is amazing for
your lower lash line because it is the
tiniest little wand look how skinny that
is which makes it so easy to coat your
bottom lashes and I had tried it on my
top lashes in like a recent video and I
didn't really like how it looked but if
you really build it up it can get really
really volumizing and I really like the
look it gives my lashes I have other
mascaras I love more than this but when
it comes to a tubing mascara this is
hands-down the best I've ever tried and
I've tried a few brands it is a little
bit pricey but I do think it's
definitely worth the money especially on
days where I'm like oh I don't want to
put on that much makeup I'll put on a
little bit of this and then I'm good
because it's just so easy to remove so I
love you trish mcevoy how about mascara
in Joe Black okay so my next product is
a foundation which I'm sure you totally
saw coming ever since I tried this I
have been using it non-stop this is the
la girl pro coverage high definition
long wear illuminating foundation I am
in the shade fair this is the foundation
I'm wearing on my face today I love this
foundation so much the more I wear it
the more I love it I believe it's only
ten dollars extremely affordable I love
the finish of this it gives your face a
beautiful dewy look but it's not too
dewy it doesn't look greasy on the skin
but you do want to make sure that you
set this foundation down it is tacky to
the touch it will get everywhere will
slip and slide everywhere if you don't
set it but I find that when you set it
it still leaves your face looking
beautiful and natural
there is nothing I dislike about this
literally nothing I wish it did lasts a
little bit longer on my skin it says
it's long wearing and it is I mean I get
a good like 7 hours out of this but I
wish it just lasted a little bit longer
but honestly for the price I cannot
complain it's so good concealer blends
really nicely on top
I just really truly love this I love
that it's a pump I mean it's so good you
can get la girl
on the la girl website or I think you
can also get this brand at certain
dollar stores don't hold me on that I
would highly recommend this if you have
normal to dry skin I think you would
really really like it at least I think
you would I truly love it and I also
used this one I've only used this one or
two times but I really liked it as well
this is the white foundation this is
awesome to mix in with any of your dark
foundations any of your more summer
shades we're now going into winter and I
think that this is such a cool little
thing to have because you could just mix
it with your summer foundation and make
it your winter foundation and you only
have to spend ten dollars you don't have
to go and buy a brand new foundation and
because I like the formula so much it's
like the same formula I love it it works
really well blended in with other
foundations I don't think it really
changes the consistency of the other
foundations Manic Panic has a white
foundation that I've spoken about in the
past that I really like I think I might
even like this one a little bit more I
have to play around with it more I've
only used it a couple times but I really
really do like the white one as well I
just I am obsessed I've definitely been
loving this it's like my top love this
month okay so now we're going kind of
like on the other side of the spectrum
in terms of price my next favorite is a
blush that is seriously ridiculously
overpriced especially for what it looks
like
well this is a blush from the brand
Sarat not exactly sure if that's how you
say this this is the strangest little
blush it comes in like this little
flimsy packaging I mean look at this
tiny thing it's like like this packaging
is plastic and it just like comes out
you would think this is like a pan that
you would throw in a Z palette but it's
not like this is the packaging it's
really weird I'm not a big fan of this
packaging and the fact that it like
slides out and it's just kind of weird
it's like what is this like what is this
packaging this is a $32 blush I bought
this at Sephora and when I got in the
mail I was like what in tarnation is
this but the second I put it on my face
I was like wow I love this I love this
color so much it's the blush I'm wearing
on my cheeks you guys know I like a very
muted tone down blush this one is in the
shade sheller
this is such a pretty everyday color in
the pan
really doesn't look like anything
special but it almost has kind of like a
satin finish and on the cheeks it kind
of gives your face a hair of a glow a
satin look it doesn't look like a matte
flat chalky blush there's like life to
this blush I don't know it's very very
beautiful like every time I put on
makeup this is the blush I go for ever
since I bought it
I've been using it so much this month
it's like falling out of this tube
packaging I hates brick I looked at as
the packaging because the color is so
beautiful and I really like the finish
I'm sure there's a bunch of colors on
the market that looked just like this
but there's something special about it I
don't even know how to explain it online
it's described as a sunkissed nude and I
totally agree if you look sunkissed but
nude I hate that I love it but I do I
love this blush I definitely see it as
like my go-to for a really really long
time they would just like you know not
have it look like this that'd be
fabulous speaking of beautiful I have
rediscovered something that I haven't
used in so long if you've been following
my channel for a while you're like oh my
gosh she still have that but I do this
is the Physicians Formula natural nude
highlighter I cut mine this had like a
back piece but I cut it because it
didn't fit into my slots and the only
way it would fit into the little slot
was if I cut it so I did so now it's
like broken but I mean you could see the
mirror it's you know that back piece was
doing nothing anyway these highlights
have a really weird name because
Physicians Formula also has a shimmer
strip that doesn't look anything like
this but on the website this is
described as a shimmer strip as well is
there a shimmer strip custom all-in-one
nude palette for face and eyes in the
shade natural nude if you want an
incredible beaming amazing like
out-of-this-world highlight for under
$15 this is your guy right here I
believe it's like $13.99 pretty pricey
for drugstore but this is one of the
best highlights at the drugstore hands
down this is the highlight I'm wearing
on my face right now and I love that you
get so many little squares you can get
like a super white intense highlight
something a little bit more pink or
something a little bit more golden you
have all of that in one I love this I
pulled this back out
like use in a video I think in a
tutorial and I was like why don't I use
this anymore
it has quickly become one of my favorite
products ever I think I even like it
more now than I did before even if
you're not someone who really likes
drugstore makeup you need to try this
the quality is out of this world like if
you would have covered this and labeled
this as a Becca highlight I would have
thought it was a BEC highlight get your
hands on this I think it's really really
amazing and I think it would work for
every skin tone because you go from like
this white shade to like a beautiful
deep bronze so good I cannot I cut top i
could talk here for hours about this
it's awesome my next favorite is really
weird like really really weird this is a
little like spatula thing from ELF i was
actually just on the website to see what
this is called and i had no idea
elf makes a brush cleaning glove what it
has 5 stars and it's only 10 bucks oh my
gosh i'm gonna buy that after i filmed
this video anyway i can't find this on
the freaking website i just can't go
through all these pages right now we're
gonna call it the little elf spatula it
has this like blue silicone spatula at
one end and then like this little weird
little brush don't exactly know what
this is about but I love this little
thing so as you know face masks usually
most of the time always come in like a
little jar and it's not extremely
sanitary to just constantly dip your
fingers in there even if you wash your
hands before hand which I totally
recommend but even if you wash your
hands
it doesn't it you know it's your fingers
I don't know I just I don't like doing
it well this is the perfect little tool
for that I just scooped up some face
masks and then I apply it to my skin and
this little silicone thing applies your
face mask really easily really evenly
you get like a perfect thin layer on
your entire face and you don't have to
dirty your fingers in the process which
i think is a fabulous thing I have been
loving this for months but I thought it
was something I should mention because I
don't know some of us don't like to put
our fingers in face masks but we also
don't want to use other things like I
used to use a regular like foundation
brush to apply my face masks but this
works a little bit better it's really
affordable really good if you are a face
mask applier like some people don't
really do that but
you're someone who really indulges in a
good face mask once or twice a week I
highly recommend you pick this up
because it's just it's just a breeze
this little thing I love it okay so I
have three lip products that I have been
wearing non-stop the first one is
definitely the thing I have on my mouth
this is the ofra long lasting liquid
lipstick in the shade too skinny when I
first got this color in the mail I was
like oh pretty a nice Mavi purple
I thought I wasn't gonna be anything
special I've seen this color a hundred
times before but for some reason when I
applied it I felt completely in love
with this color it is one of my feet oh
I had a liquid lipstick on my tooth this
whole time it's definitely one of my
favorite over liquid lipsticks ever
aside from the sword and - if you know
what I mean I love this color
so much it's kind of like a mauve and a
berry color got together and had a love
child and it was Tuscany I loved it so
much and I think it's one of those
colors that would look beautiful and
literally everyone like literally I
can't think of somebody this wouldn't
look good on even with a look today all
I did was put on a little bit of
eyeshadow and I throw on some mascara
and I put this lip on and I feel I feel
good
I love this color if you're into purples
and you're into mobs I'm I am I love
Purple's I love I sped everywhere
I love Purple's I love moths but I'm
someone who prefers like oranges and
rusty red tones like very warm colors
but this this is making me change my
mind I love this shade so so much so
I've been wearing that a lot and I
wanted to give a quick shout-out to
colourpop's Libby stick in the shade
chateau this is one of their matte ex
formulas which is like a completely
different formula from their regular
matte lippie stix their matte lippie
stix like Lumiere their matte but
they're not like matte they have a
little bit of moisture to them these are
matte like they're there as matte as a
lipstick could possibly get when you're
wearing one of these matte ex formulas
they look like liquid lipsticks on the
lips they dry so matte and before this
formula I thought that you could only
get that look with a liquid lipstick but
no color pop proved that you can get
that look with a lipstick I love this
color I used it in a recent makeup
tutorial so beautiful for the holidays
it's a red but it's like a blackened red
it's like a very it's like a black
cherry yeah it's like a blah
cherry very very deep very vampy but
it's eye-catching it is stunning it's a
little bit hard to apply for me because
it's so dark like so dark you have to
work with it a little bit but once you
do it looks fabulous and then the last
lip product I want to talk about is
something that I have thrown in my purse
and there are like three lipsticks that
live in my purse at all times three lip
products it's the buxom lip gloss and
white Russian the Tarte lipstick in Park
Avenue princess funny because I've never
really mentioned that on my channel but
it's one of my favorite lipsticks of all
time it literally lives in my purse
which is probably why I haven't
mentioned it or use it on my channel but
tarts Park Avenue princess lipstick and
my colour-pop lippie stick and Aquarius
those three shades they don't leave my
purse they got a new roommate a couple
of weeks ago and it is the essence
lipstick in the shade cool nude I
mentioned this in my favorite affordable
fall lipstick video and when I used it
in that video I was like oh my gosh why
don't I bust this out again and use it
more often and that's exactly what I did
I have been using it so much just on
days where all I do is fill in my
eyebrows put on mascara and put on a
lipstick I don't even bother with
concealer it's just it's been a crazy
month guys it's been it's been real
intense this color is just so beautiful
it's a nude but it's a very cool tone
nude it has a little bit of Mothe to it
but it's light enough to wear it's
amazing for everyday it goes with
everything it's not too dark it's like
the perfect shade of a cool tone nude I
don't know it's really really amazing I
got this at Ulta and it was like a few
dollars essence is such an affordable
brand you need to get your hands on it
if you're into these tones you need this
lipstick like you really do okay two
more products to share with you and then
this video is over funny how I said that
I didn't have a lot of products at
talking well but I've been here for a
while already my next favorite is
something that I didn't think I was
gonna like as much as I do this is the
glam glow dream duo
over night transforming treatment I
recently bought this after hearing so
many people rave about it I think I saw
a video where Mannie was talking about
it and I was like okay fine I'm gonna
buy that because in the past I haven't
been extremely impressed with glam glow
the only masks I truly deeply love is
the black one it's like the tingle
exfoliating one which apparently is like
everybody's least favorite but that
is my favorite Danny also really likes
the white one but there's so many dupes
for the white one that I don't I don't
find that one worth it whatever point is
I haven't been like oh my gosh over the
moon impress with glam glow but this I
actually really really like now I've
only used this five times but I mean the
five times that I've used it I have been
really really impressed with the results
so it says it's an overnight
transforming treatment basically it has
two different masks or overnight
treatments you have step one and then
you have step two you're supposed to put
this one on first this like creamy white
color and you let that sink in and let
it dry for about 30 seconds and then you
go over it with the grey one and then
you go to sleep and you're supposed to
wake up with like very hydrated
beautiful skin it's supposed to help
with your texture and with your dryness
and recently because of all of the
treatments I've been doing to my face
trying to get rid of like the bumps on
my skin it has really really really
dried out my skin like even more than
before if I thought I had dry skin
before ah laude and this has helped it
so much every time I use it I wake up in
the morning and my face almost looks
like plumper it looks way more hydrated
way more smooth and I mean it's it's
what I can ask for because momma has
been needing some help in the hydration
category but it is $60 so if I can you
know maybe try something else it's not
as expensive that'd be great
but besides that I love this the price a
little steep but it just makes my skin
look so glowy and luminous the very next
day okay so my last favorite is actually
this I love this this is the Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson's baby soothing vapour bath
comforts fussy babies so as some of you
know I suffer from like really bad
migraines and actually one of you guys
commented either on Instagram or Twitter
one of you told me to pick this up
because it really helped you with your
migraines so I picked this up and I fell
in love with this I love baths after
I've already showered there's something
about sitting in your own you know bath
water that's a little bit weird but what
I like to do is I'll take a shower and
I'll wash my entire body and then I'll
just sit in a bath once I'm already
clean and it really just helps me relax
like it really helps me relax it smells
like vicks vapor rub you know one of
those scents it kind of like takes over
the whole bath and you're like you feel
like you're in a spa especially when I
feel sick like when I feel like I'm
getting a cold and my nose is a little
stuffy I'll take a bath with this and it
like clears out my congestion
you know we're baby sometimes and we get
fussy and this is very comforting it's
just amazing thank you so much to the
subscriber who recommended this for my
headaches because it really has been
helping calm me down if I have a lot of
anxiety but having like a very stressful
day I'll just take a bath with this and
the scent really does like chill me out
the vapor in it just like makes me
breathe better maybe that's in my head
but I feel like the scent make helps me
breathe so yeah that can leave this
video these were products I've really
really been loving in the month of
November in a Rakhi month um in terms of
like my anxiety it's kind of coming back
pretty strong like how it was a few
years ago and this month was just not a
super make up II month for me I am
