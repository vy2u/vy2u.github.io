in FC Bagon Bagon I got a bunch of
questions from you guys asking me if I
entered my subscription with Ipsy and I
have not sometimes I just don't get
around to posting the videos because I
always get it either the second to last
week of the month or the last week in
the one and then by the time I try to
get around to filming and it's ready the
next month which is why this video is
going up so late in November I'm so
sorry
but I thought I was worth it to do it
anyway so that's what I did - by the way
do you like my shirt yeah myself and no
show if you don't know how power line is
I don't know if we're gonna be friends
anyway this is what the Ipsy bag looks
like this month but it cute made a cute
and it comes a little card all you MC
November 2017 okay so you guys know I
always open these up first just so I can
see what I can or cannot put on my face
and I'm not wearing any makeup today
look I have my eyebrows on but I'm not
wearing any makeup today because there's
actually two skin care products in the
bag this month you have this scrubbing
cream from the brand Co ditch Paris it's
like an exfoliator and then they also
have this Clarksville technicals deep
moisture mask I really don't want to
overdo it with the skincare so I'm only
gonna be doing one of these today I
think I'm gonna try out the mask gliadin
earlier to clean face and neck leave on
for 15 to 20 minutes and then rinse it
says as a moisturizer apply sparingly to
clean skin but anyway I did wash my face
before I put on my eyebrows so my face
is nice and clean and I'm just gonna
apply a generous layer to my face this
does feel like a moisturizer though not
like a face mask
Thank You mirror I mean it's a deep
moisture mask it's not like a clay mud
mask or anything so I don't know why I
expected it to not be moisturizing but
ignore me my skin
can really use some moisture so I'm
actually really excited for this it does
smell like sunscreen now it not
sunscreen it smells like not sunscreen
oh my gosh this smells exactly like a
pons cream I used to use back in the day
that brand pons but that moisturizer
ended up really irritating my skin so
it's like taking me back to that by the
way as always I will have the list of
products I got in the bag along with the
price of the full-size item just so you
know how much these items cost okay so
I'm gonna leave that on my face for 20
minutes and then I will rinse it off and
then have a period back alright it's
been 20 minutes and I just rinsed my
face and I did notice while I was
wearing it it was starting to dry it got
a little bit tight and didn't get like a
clay mask or anything but I did notice
my skin feeling a little bit tighter
like the mask was drying down and my
face looks hydrated and it does feel
hydrated I wouldn't say it feels like
super soft or anything but it does feel
hydrated but for me masks are just
things I have to use way more than once
to see if I like it or not I'm rarely
ever blown away by a first impression on
a face mask unless it's like masks that
are supposed to get rid of all the
toxins in your pores and things like
that those all kind of know right away
if I like them but these hydrating masks
I have to use them more than once to see
if I really like it or not so I will put
that to the test later on but before I
go back into my Ipsy bag I'm just gonna
quickly put on like my foundation and
concealer and all that good stuff
alright I'm back and I am an idiot I had
one more thing in my bag that I was
supposed to try on before I put on the
rest of my face makeup and I didn't
notice until right now like right before
I pressed record this is the Mac prep
and prime natural radiance base this is
a primer and this one is in radiant
yellow they have like radiant pink and I
think and this is the yellow one
AHA man I can't I forgot to put this on
actually I've never tried this before I
know that these are very popular these
natural radiant spaces I haven't tried
this one in radiant yellow this feels
super moisturizing on the back of my
hand though like wow like extremely
moisturizing this might be a really good
primer for me I'm still gonna test out
this sample on a later day
then we have two more things and I have
to say that when I saw this I nearly
pissed my pants this is a Lisa Frank
product do you guys remember Lisa Frank
when I was a little girl I had so many
Lisa Frank folders remember this little
cheetah and they had like the Dolphins
one in the little panda bears I used to
love Lisa Frank and I didn't even know
that they had Lisa Frank makeup that is
crazy I don't know if this is like the
only thing or if Lisa Frank has more
makeup and if Lisa Frank has more makeup
I'm gonna find more Lisa Frank makeup
this is all we know this is a collab
there's no paper with a description so I
have to guess these things but it says
Lisa Frank x glamour dolls so it's like
a collaboration with glamour dolls and
this is their bitten and bronzed matte
bronzer this is what it looks like this
is so cute I love this little box I wish
this packaging would have looked like
this but that's just me being 12 this
actually looks like a really good color
I'm gonna take this NARS brush that I
don't know the name of and I'm gonna use
that to contour the cheeks I mainly get
them like contour and bronze
because I feel like this might be a
little bit too warm to contour but let's
see
well I actually really like this bronzer
it blends really nicely it's very smooth
I didn't even set my foundation I'm
wearing the a cosmetics CC cream and I
didn't even set it and it's not skipping
or anything this is a good sized bronzer
it's pretty big I mean it's not huge but
it's larger than a regular little sample
that's for sure this one is a winner I
think it's so pretty
it makes me look so tan and face I mean
bronze my neck cuz you know Wow good job
glamour dolls this is so pretty I really
like this color a lot it's so warm and
bronzy but not orange II like it's nice
and tan looking I really like this I'm
gonna keep this on my vanity I feel like
I'm gonna use this all the time and then
the last thing in the bag is actually
really exciting as well it is a mini
little Tarte Amazonian clay blush these
blushes are incredible they're amazing
one of my favorite high-end blushes ever
and this is in the shade feisty I don't
even think I have this I don't know
what this shade looks like whew that is
a beautiful color just beautifu I'm
gonna take my makeup over stippling
brush you know apply this to the cheeks
you know what I love these blushes a
size I know this isn't a full-sized book
but I love these little ones they're so
easy to travel with you just throw this
in your bag it will take you forever to
go through an Amazonian clay blush I
feel like they're really hard to go
through but some that bush I'm doing my
sheets
pretty pretty I don't know why I make
such a weird face when I'm applying
products that's a stop doing that
okay that is too much
Smosh is super pigmented I feel like a
little does go a really long way so you
will not go through this blush very
quickly which is a great thing but that
blush is so pretty so warm and I think
that's the kind of blush that would look
awesome in the summer but also in the
fall
okay guys but that's everything I got in
this bag I'm actually really excited
about this bag just for this Lisa Frank
thing like this is all I needed this is
a great bronzer I don't know how long it
lasts on the skin but I really like the
formula I love how it blends it really
great I love these Tarte blushes like
these two things make the bag so good
this month so definite let me know if
you like your FC bag this month and what
you thought about it did you love is did
you hate it I would love to know your
thoughts yeah that this bag was pretty
good and yeah guys that completes this
video I hope you guys enjoyed see you
