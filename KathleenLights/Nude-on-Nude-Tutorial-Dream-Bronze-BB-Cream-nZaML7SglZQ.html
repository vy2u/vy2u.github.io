on this look right here it's like the
most simplest look ever mainly wanted to
do this video because I used the
Maybelline Dream bronze BB cream this
product is like pretty new and I decided
to take inspiration from it so I did
like a very tanned skin bronzy makeup
actually pretty tan I have like a fresh
tan on I don't know if my lights are
showing that I mainly wanted to focus
this tutorial on the face like a very
bronze glowy face so the eyes are very
very simple very basic I'm actually
going to talk about this a little bit
more at the end of the video so if you
want a review on this product just stay
tuned - after the tutorial and if you
want to see how to get these look then
just keep watching okay so I'm a fool
and I didn't show you guys what I'm
mixing or what I'm using but I mix the
Maybelline Dream pure BB cream in with
the Maybelline Dream bronze BB cream
like I showed you earlier I mix those
two together because the bronze one on
its own is a little bit too bronzed so I
wanted to mix in one with like more of a
flesh tone or one closer to my face and
then I realized in this clip that I
didn't put on primer but that's okay
this kind of works as a primer and a BB
cream all-in-one look at that glow girl
look at that glow this is some intense
bronze leanness I like it so yeah here I
am showing you the two things that I
mixed
I'm thinking the NYX HD concealer in the
shade beige and I'm applying this
underneath my eyes to kind of highlight
and cover up my dark circles as well I'm
playing it to my eyes as well to kind of
use it as a primer or an eyeshadow base
I'm highlighting other parts of my face
to kind of like I always do
then I'm going to take this of Dream
Lumi concealer and I'm going to apply
that all over the areas that I applied
that concealer because that concealer is
kind of thick so applying this on top
not only helps highlight but it kind of
makes it easier to blend out that nyx
concealer and of course blending that
with my favorite concealer blending
brush this is the Sedona lace 217
now I'm going to take the Maybelline fit
me powder in 1/35 creamy natural I
cannot find 135 anywhere I hope they
didn't discontinued it because it's my
favorite setting powder front of the
eyes from the drugstore and if they
discontinued it I'll be very sad see yes
I'm just using that then I'm going to
take this bourgeois bronzing primer it's
amazing look at it it's beautiful it's
very similar to this chanel so late and
a chanel whatever that's called it's
very similar it's just like a moosie
consistency and it's a nice warm bronzy
color so I'm using my Real Techniques
sculpting brush to just bronze up my
face I'm not trying to like do any harsh
contouring since this is a warmer
bronzer I'm just giving myself more of a
tan you know more warming miss yeah this
is a Stila blush what is this called
what is this called what is this cold
this is the aqua glow watercolor blush
and this is in the shade shimmering
Lotus I like to apply it on the back of
my hand first because it can be a little
tips and then apply it to my cheeks this
is basically like a liquid blush it's
not even a cream it's like a pure
liquidy blush it's kind of awesome I
really like it it's really pretty if you
get used to like you have to get used to
blending it out since it's so weird
because it's like a liquid out of them
this is the Milani bronzer in the shade
glow I use this more kind of like a warm
blush because it's a bronzer but it has
a little bit of pink to it and it's very
shimmery it's actually really really
pretty especially in the summer time I'm
going to move on to my eyes I want to
keep it very very simple so I'm using
the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade
it's a nice like vanilla shade I'm using
this to highlight underneath my brow
bone using a morphe brush not sure what
that one's called I think it's the e 14
maybe
I'm also applying that in beach like in
my tear duct area as well then I'm going
to take the shade Cornelius by the way
these both of these eye shadows are from
my collab with color pop the where the
light is quad flam I'm taking Cornelius
and I'm applying this to my entire lid
I'm dragging that underneath my lower
lash line as well this is a very very
natural color but like I said I wanted
to keep it very very simple I'm going to
take a fluffy brush dip it right back
into Cornelius and then apply this to my
crease to kind of diffuse the look and
just bring it up higher
I'm gonna take this Milani Bella
eyeshadow in the shade Bella chiffon so
just stunning like white gold and I'm
applying this in my inner tear-duct
since everything else is so Matt I want
a very bright inner corner then I'm
gonna take this a wizzy Scott oh the Kat
Von D ink liner I believe this is in the
same actually I have it here let me
check this is in the shade Hemingway so
I'm applying this really really close to
my lashline as if I was going to wing it
out but I actually don't wing it out I
just create a line and I like it because
it's brown it's not as harsh and then
I'm going to apply two coats of my
L'Oreal telescopic mascara and I also
applied that to my bottom lashes for my
lips I'm keeping it very very simple I'm
just using the Anastasia lip gloss in
the shade undress and that's all I'm
doing for my lips so yeah now if you
want to see a really review on the BB
cream just keep watching so if you're
watching this part of the video then you
want my little review on this product I
didn't want to do a whole separate
review on this since umm I have that
covergirl foundation review up and I
don't want like to review so much I like
this product this is the second time I
use it the first time I used it
completely by itself and it wasn't my
favorite because it's dark I have the
one for light to medium skin tones
um and it's like a medium I wouldn't say
it's for light to medium if you are
super fair I recommend using this as a
bronzer like as a cream bronzer or you
can use this mixed in which is how I
like to use it and if you are really
really dark skinned I think they might
have deeper ones so the way that I like
to use this is mixed with foundations
when I'm tan because it is a bronzer
kind of I like to mix it in like today I
mix it in with my dream pure BB cream to
get like a more lightweight coverage and
it works really really well this way I
don't like the original BB cream by
Maybelline but I like this one
salicylic acid and it's good okay this
would be awesome if you want super
Jennifer Lopez skin I was gonna say
Louis superitendent for Lopez skin but
you have a very very matte foundation so
mixing in a little bit of this it's just
going to make it really dewy and bronzy
I kind of really love that about this I
like it to mix by itself no you could
also use this like on top of your
foundation just to kind of like bronze
up the skin like a liquid bronzer so I
really like this idea I actually kind of
love it I think it's really good I've
only used it twice but I'm playing
around with it and I really like how
it's been working for me so I highly
recommend it only if you have normal to
dry skin oily skin stay away from this
unless you're using it in certain areas
as well sir so yeah that is my quick
little mini review I hope you guys
enjoyed this look thank you guys so much

haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
