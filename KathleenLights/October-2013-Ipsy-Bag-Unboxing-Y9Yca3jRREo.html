literally just walked through the door
right now it is now 439 can't see that
but it is now 435 and I got my empty bag
in the mail today and you guys know that
I always do my Ipsy unboxings where I
opened them for the first time on camera
and I just want to say that I'm so sorry
that I haven't posted a video this week
I am usually very constant with my
videos I try to put up three videos a
week and last week and this week I have
been completely swamped at work
I literally just came back from work and
I wasn't even gonna film this because as
you can see from the shadows that are
forming in this video it's really dark
outside it's almost five o'clock and I
like to film during the day on my days
off so I do want to apologize for that
because I know that I promised you guys
a lot of new videos and tutorials and
stuff which are still in the works just
bear with me tomorrow is my day off if
I'm filming tomorrow so hopefully I'll
get back in the swing of things of
uploading three times a week I promise
I'm gonna try my best but anyway let's
move on to the actual video okay so this
month
if seabag looks like this it's just a
white bag that says love of beauty is
taste the creation of beauty is art and
it's written like really pretty cursive
that's my cursor so really pretty
handwriting and it took you back this
month
it also came with this card and you know
how I feel about those cards so the
first thing in the bag is actually in
this vatican's it didn't fit in this bag
and it is the Coastal Scents medium
shadow brush is obviously both sides of
brush it's not like a little travel-size
or anything and I own a couple of the
Coastal Scents brushes and I really like
them they're really affordable and this
is just your basic soft just your basic
shadow brush it's soft it's nice and
soft um if you buy this on the website
it is $2.49 like I said very cheap but
not bad quality at all so I mean I guess
everyone can get some use out of this
the nice thing in the bike is something
that I'm pretty sure everybody got this
month and it is a so nail polish they've
sent us all your nail polish before and
I love it
and this one is oh this one is called
nev nev nev e i don't know any v and it
is just this bluish purple e kind of
color this isn't my favorite type of
finish in a nail polish it's a little
bit shiny I usually like just solid
creamy kind of colors but I definitely
think this would be good for fall and it
is really good quality zoya has amazing
nail polishes and these are $8 so you
get full size Zoe nail polish which is
awesome
the next thing in the bag is called
nourish organic food for healthy skin
deeply nourishing coconut and Argan body
lotion ooh and of coconut Christmas
oh my god
this smells amazing
oh my god this smells so good
and the smell of this this smells so
amazing it's definitely really really
really really really sweet you're not
someone who likes their hand creams or
lotions to smell really sweet this
probably isn't the product for you but I
am just like smells so good
this is obviously like a travel sized
version but the full version of this
costs $10 and you can find this brand at
Target so that's good it does feel
really good on your hands though because
I am someone who hates lotion I hate
hand cream like any type of moisturizer
I hate applying it because I hate the
feeling of moisturizer on my hands so
every time I apply like a moisturizer I
have to wash my hands after I know it's
weird but I hate the texture of cream
but this actually absorbs right into
your skin and my hands feel extremely
soft right now so I definitely am going
to look into this brand at Target cos
it's so good I love this the next thing
is this style sexy hair spray clay
texturizing spray clay spray into hair
for texture and hold to finish desired
style oh it smells really fresh it's
most really good
I love usually how like the sexy hair
stuff smells anyway this size is eight
dollars the full size of this is 1895
but you can buy this like at Ulta for
about eight dollars which is pretty good
because the bag is $10 so this is pretty
much almost the price of the bag so this
is good if you like like texturizing
sprays and stuff and then the last thing
in the bag is this Bella Terra of
mineral cosmetics it is a mineral
shimmer in
emotion it's a purple color oh it's a
really pretty purple color actually I'm
glad that they sent like a very wearable
shade I feel like a lot of people like
wearing purple on their eyes and purple
complements so many different eye colors
so this seems like a really good product
and from the looks of it this is a
full-sized product and these retail for
$14.99 which is awesome because that's
pretty expensive for one little shimmer
powder eye shadow thing okay so that's
it that is everything I got in my Ipsy
bag this month actually really like the
bag this month um I think that I would
get use out of absolutely everything
that I got the lotion is kind of giving
me a little bit of a headache not gonna
lie it is strong it is wrong but yeah I
pretty much loved everything that I got
the overall price for the bag is over
$40 which is awesome considering you pay
ten thank you so much for watching guys
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
you know the deal folks I don't ever
film an Ipsy bag unboxing without that
at least trying something on and excuse
my under eye circles I was at work all
day and I look like a complete hot mess
my makeup has like melted already okay
so I'm gonna try the mineral eye shadow
I got absolutely everywhere when I
opened it this brush is really soft
I like this brush
I like this eyeshadow it's really
wearable I mean of course I have it on
top of like a topi color but it's not
too intense or too bright I think a lot
of people would look at with this I
should I want they approve eye proof I'm
going to swatch this soya
nail polish on my fingers maybe you guys
would be on my nan my fingers on my
nails maybe you guys would be interested
in seeing what this color looks like
since I haven't done my nails yet so
it's of course my network struggle wow
this paints really opaque in just one
one coat just to show you okay this is
like the sloppiest watch in the world
but I just wanted to show you the color
on my actual nails this is the color I
got it's a very like metallicky blue but
I think you know I usually don't like
these metallic kind of colors but I
think it would look really pretty in the
fall with like a nice outfit I think
would complement and outfit pretty
nicely so many people on the Ipsy
website I was looking at right now hated
the smell of this it's so crazy to me
they really didn't like the smell of
this they really didn't I actually
really do I love how it smells I do
think it's a little bit strong though so
use it wisely because it can give you a
headache I think I'm done now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
