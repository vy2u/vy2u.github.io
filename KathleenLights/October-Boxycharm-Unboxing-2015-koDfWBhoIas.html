my back shame and Batson excuse me for
putting this video up like on the last
day of October oh my gosh I haven't
painted my nails so I usually put this
video up like um I get this pretty early
I get like mid October or like mid month
and I usually have this video up around
the 15th around there but I have been I
don't know if you can tell in my voice
but I've been really sick for like a
week and I've had this box but I just
could not film if you guys follow me on
Twitter um I was telling you guys how
I've just been like with a cold and
stuff and I didn't want to sit down and
like dark like meats and have boogers
fallin on my face so I'm feeling a
little bit better today so I decided to
try and film this and get it up for you
I'm really sorry how late it is um I
just want to talk about this really
quick this thing on my face if you guys
follow me on snapchat you already know I
will have my snapchat name down below so
basically I was at my mom's house
because she is making my yzma costume
and I've been going over there so she
can like help me make my costume and
she's very crafty so I had like my neck
P I'm gonna be yzma following I'm the
Emperor's New Groove and I had my neck
piece on and she went to glue something
while it was still on my like neck and
she missed and hit my face she like
touched my face with the hot glue gun
and I was like wow and that is why I
have a burn on my face it's not a pimple
or a mole it's a burn mark okay so let's
get into why you are actually here let's
open the books I have refrained
restrained myself from watching any
boxycharm unboxing so I don't want to
know okay so this is what the box looks
like this month this is really cool I
really like this says phases of the Moon
so they have oh everything is like a
black in here you can't see it it's cool
okay so the first thing I see is this
because it's the only thing with white
lettering on it and this is from a brand
called Lord and berry I'm going to
assume my nose is so stuffy it says line
and shade eyeliner and shadow pencil oh
it's in the shade dark black okay
would say regular just eyeliner is a
full-size product in this retails for
$18 I want to see how black this is I'm
not typically a fan of wooden eyeliners
but I just want to test out the
intensity oh holy crap oh okay okay I'm
not just saying that
honestly this is so creamy this is such
a creamy eyeliner and it's really really
intense I expected something a little
bit drier I'm not gonna lie but it is
pretty freakin creamy actually about to
go have lunch with someone so I don't
want to just like start smudging black
eyeliner on my face usually I would try
this out for you guys but oh this would
be really good for this is definitely
not smudge proof but this would be
really good for like a smoky eye most of
my blacks are like smudge proof which is
good but oh this blends out really
nicely I'm excited I like this I didn't
think I was but I mean I haven't tried
on my face but this would be cool as a
base for a smokey eye or anything you
want to like smudge and make deeper
that's awesome by the way you guys can't
see my shirt but it says Monica and
Chandler and Joey and Phoebe and Ross
and Rachel and I love it I got it on
Etsy
all I did was like search friends TV
show t-shirts and this popped up and I
bought it so I know no one cares but
whatever so the next thing in the box
let's just grab this oh this is very
large this is a Paul metal derma
rejuvenating antioxidant mask I'm pretty
sure we've got in the brand Paul metal
derma inner box before and this is a
soft clay mask that gently purifies the
skin and cleanses pores by observing
observing absorbing impurities it's
advanced antioxidant defend against free
radicals to reserve daily damage while
it's cooling effect reflects and sue
this refreshes and subas I'm sick and I
can't read anything Oh looks like
oatmeal I can't smell it because my nose
stuffy so why did I even try I love me
some face masks so I'm really excited to
try this one out leave me a comment down
below if you got this in your box and if
you tried it how you liked it because
obviously I don't know if it's good or
not this is of course a full-sized
product it's a big old face mask and
this retails for $64 ok that's expensive
that's that's very expensive
for a face mask it's like almost as much
as a glam glow mask and you pay $21 for
this box this is a monthly subscription
box that only cost $21 and you get
little presents like this that are worth
sixty it's crazy
next thing in the box I'm excited for I
love getting nail polish in my monthly
subscription service recently I don't
know I mean I'm not wearing any right
now but recently I have become addicted
to nail polish I don't know what it is
i buy nail polish i buy like one a day
for like the past week like I've become
obsessed I'm because this is from a
brand called cult cult Cosmetics nail
polish this is a full-size nail polish
of course and it retails for $12 and
I've never heard of this brand but it's
a really amazing dark gray I love this
for the fall in winter time I love dark
nail okay so next thing in the buff huh
next thing in the Box is this guy right
here I love how everything is been like
black packaging I love the theme this
month awesome this is the Punk
volumizer mascara from a brand called
dos Dolce dowse I don't know whatever
it's a volumizing mascara it's full size
and this retails for $24 that's pretty
pre pricey for a mascara it says the
Punk volumizer mascara
XXL brush oh it's a very large brush I'm
going to assume it features both long
and short bristles that work to separate
lengthen and add extreme volume let's
see this brush I'm scared
oh my gosh holy crap that is big so I'm
gonna give this a shot and I will get
back to you guys I'm sorry that I'm not
demoing them in this video you guys know
my situation I'm not even home and I'm
sick and there's a lot going on but I
will start demoing these products next
month I will get back to it next month
you bet your arse I will okay and then
there's one more product and it is this
guy right here this is from a brand
called bellapierre and we have bought in
this this brand in the box before so I
am familiar with this brand and it is a
cheek and lip stain this is full size
and it is $19.99 it's oil free chicken
lip chicken lip Belfry cheek and lip
stain to add a subtle flush to any look
so oh my god I love the color it's like
a really pretty peachy peachy color oh
that's so pretty
I really like it I'm gonna try to put it
over what I have going on right now
they're similar this is a little lighter
I really like this color this would even
be awesome as a cream blush like in the
summertime I don't do cream blush all
that much in the winter in the fall but
I really it's creamy I thought it was
gonna be a little bit drying but it's a
really nice creamy not like waxy I like
the consistency well that was everything
I got in my box this month I am most
excited for the face mask and the nail
polish and I'm actually super impressed
with the smudge enos and the coolness of
that eyeliner I got let me do the math
so the overall value of the box this
month was 137 dollars
honestly you cannot go wrong with
boxycharm I know it's a little bit
pricier than like your typical like $10
monthly subscription but you don't get
samples in the box that's what sets
boxycharm apart I think a lot of
companies will give you like deluxe
samples which I like do not get me wrong
I love getting like deluxe samples in
the mail but these guys provide
full-size products so if
like it I mean you have the full-size
which is awesome and you do get your
money's worth out of every single box
because it's always valued at way more
than $21 so I will have their website
down below I really like this month
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
