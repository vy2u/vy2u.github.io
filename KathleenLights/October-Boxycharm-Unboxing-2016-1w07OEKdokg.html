my best sherman Beth so last time I
filmed my boxycharm video I asked you
guys if you preferred the style I did
where I already opened the box I did a
peek inside to see what I got but I
didn't physically like open anything so
I'm not sure about colors and stuff I
just know what I have does that make
sense of it and I asked you guys if you
liked the fact that I was like trying
them on as I opened the box instead of
just inserting clips of me actually
applying the product and the bolts are
in you guys really liked it this way and
I actually like it this way too I think
it gives a little bit of a twist to the
video and I can give you guys my initial
like first impressions right off the bat
so yes let's open it okay so the theme
for this month is boxy bizarre it's kind
of like circus themed you know and the
first thing in the Box is a brush this
is from the brand Luxy and it is their
eye blender brush pack oh it's more than
one brush I opened the box like I know
it's inside but I didn't open up each
individual thing yet so I didn't know
this was a brush pack I hadn't even read
it oh cool it's like a oh it's one more
in here this is so cute it comes with
three individual eye brushes you get to
crease brushes one is a little bit
longer one is a little bit more dense
okay the three crease brush I didn't
notice that so you get three blending
brushes they're kind of like the fluffy
crease brush --is
this is perfect for those of you with
small eyes and then these two are
similar one is just a little bit more
dense and one is a little bit longer a
little bit fluffier I love Luxy brushes
I use them all the time they are really
really good quality I'm so glad they
were in the box and this little brush
pack is $36 by the way if you see
foundation on my shirt it's because I
got foundation on my shirt I made the
mistake of putting on my foundation
before I put on this shirt and this hole
here is like kind of small and I knew as
soon as I tried to put it over I was
like oh no
and the right thing would have been to
change my shirt but I didn't okay so the
next thing in the box I am so excited
about because if you watch my hair care
videos I'm obsessed with this brand and
I don't own this and I'm so happy this
is in the box this is the brioche EO
Rose Arco blow-dry perfection and heat
protectant cream no sulfates no
silicones no parabens I use the rose
Darko milk every single time I wash my
hair it's in my hair right now I swear
by it I love their deep conditioner I
just love this brand and I've never
tried their he protecting before I used
one from the brand alterna but I am so
excited to use this because broooo has
never let me down so far I don't even
know if I'm saying that right
breo's yo real Jew this is a full-sized
product and it retails for $24 I'm so
excited
ty we haven't tried anything on but this
we will try on next up is this this is
from the brand temptu I'm sure you guys
have heard of this brand before they're
one of those people that have the
airbrush foundation link with a little
pen you just put it on like that I think
you know airbrush you know and this is
like their airbrush bronzer but I
believe you can use this without the
little machine it says Tim to shimmer
bronzer this is a full-sized product and
this is $29.50 to have a few drops of
the product with clean fingers or a
synthetic bronzer brush and apply where
the Sun naturally hits the face so this
is basically a liquid bronzer if you
have that little airbrush machine that
would work but you could totally use
this without a machine the same way you
would use any liquid bronzer you guys
know I love the cover effects liquid
bronzer and I use that with a Beauty
Blender so I'm gonna use this with a
Beauty Blender let me go get one you see
in the bathroom why didn't you guys tell
me my hair is frizzy whoa whoa I'm gonna
put it on the back of my hand I think I
kind of like this color I like the
undertone well let's see it on my face
I really really like this color I think
that the undertone is so pretty it
doesn't look too orange at all and I
think it looks really really natural at
least in person it looks so natural okay
so I actually do really like this I
think it gave my face like an overall
nice healthy glow there's a little bit
of shimmer in here I mean shimmer
bronzer that's what it's called but it
doesn't look glittery or chunky on the
face which I totally appreciate and this
will last you like a million years so
the next thing in the box is in this
little bag I haven't even opened it but
I know it's fun yeah Three's Company
trail eyeshadow palette this is from the
brand IB or iby Beauty EB Ivy ivy why oh
that was hard so oh so nice my kind of
colors oh yeah so it's a really cute I
relate the packaging a really cute I
shadow tree oh it's full size and it
retails for $19 the 205 brush that we
got in the box I'm gonna dip it into
this really pretty color oh wait let me
swatch them first like I want to swatch
that okay they feel nice to feel nice
wow that gold is really pretty even this
matte color is beautiful so these are
the colors right there are those not
100%
Kathleen colors I really like them and
they're super pigmented so like I said
I'm going to take that crease color
they're very powdery though like as soon
as I put my brush in here it's a powder
hose everywhere
come and knock on my door leave away for
you where the kisses are hers and hers
miss Three's Company to come and dance
on the floor take a step that is new
clearly not a singer so I know I
definitely need to get my Sally Hansen
on and take off my peach fuzz it's about
that time so I have a little story for
you while I put on these eyeshadows now
that I look at the name of this it's
called Three's Company I used to watch
Three's Company every night before bed
every night I was obsessed with Three's
Company when I was younger and I
remember that John Ritter died in 2003
he actually died on September 11th 2003
and when I found out John Ritter diet I
cried so much and I was only 11 but I
was devastated even though that show is
like ridiculously old I was obsessed
with it and I watched it every night I
actually got to meet um kaley cuoco like
a year and a half ago at a color pop
party she was there and when I met her
the first thing I told her was how much
I loved John Ritter because she played
John Ritter's daughter in the show 8
simple rules I'm sure people go up to
her to talk about the Big Bang Theory
not 8 simple rules so I don't know I had
a love for Three's Company when I was 11
what can I say I'm just applying some of
this goals and I'm going to take another
one of those crease brushes and dip it
back into that matte shade and just buff
everything out not trying to do no fancy
look or anything but you're gonna take
this same little crease color and with
this same brush Yolo I'm sorry no one
says that anymore I apologize I'm gonna
run that I'm
lower lashline I'm going to take this
highlighting shade and I'm going to use
that to highlight my inner corners these
eye shadows would probably work best if
they are applied wet I'm going to
quickly apply some mascara and some
highlight to my face and I'll be right
back okay and then the very last thing
in the Box is this
this is the japonesque Pro performance
lip lacquer this is a full-sized product
and this is $20 it says it's a
long-lasting lip lacquer with intense
color shine and hydration so I don't
know what color this is in the shade
seven but I haven't opened it yet
hopefully it goes well with our gold
let's see is red which I love red and
gold so yay it has one of those brush
applicators those brush lip gloss
applicators I don't really like
applicators like this but let's try it
out anyway whoa that is pigment it
okay so the color is stunning I love
Reds like this but I'm not crazy about
the formula it's so pigmented and so
shiny but it kind of slips and slides a
little bit I imagine with a lip liner
underneath this would be a lot better
because I kind of struggled to get
perfectly around my mouth it's really
easy to mess up with this since it's not
like a matte liquid lipstick but I know
how everybody is on that whole liquid
lipstick matte trend I know a lot of you
guys like glossy hydrated lips so this
is definitely for you but for me
personally it's not my favorite I feel
like this would get on my teeth by the
end of the night so yeah okay guys so
that was everything I got in this
month's maxi sheer I added everything up
in the overall value of the box this
month is a hundred and twenty eight
dollars which is awesome I say it every
month but it is it's awesome boxycharm
is now shipping to Canada so if you are
Canadian or if you live in Canada
boxycharm can now get to you I will
leave the box trim website down below

crazy about was the lip let me know if
you like the box this month or if you
hated it what products did you love or
products didn't you love let me know in
