my bucks his Shuman bucks and I'm gonna
try to make this video as quick as
possible one because there isn't a lot
of products in this box to actually have
to apply to my face which kind of sucks
I know cuz I love trying out like the
full box on my face but also my camera's
dye the red a battery is blinking and I
need to get a backup battery can you
guys believe can you really believe I
make youtube videos like this is what I
do and I don't have a backup battery
like once my battery dies I have to sit
there wait for it to charge then put it
back game and keep going and literally
like every youtuber I know has like four
backup batteries you guys know I still
film with my like what is this that
little thing that flips out I don't have
a monitor like everybody else does I use
my mutilator I don't know anything about
technology or like the new stuff
monitors the new camera the equipment I
don't know anything about that so I
continue to do YouTube like I was in
2011 please excuse my hair I'm actually
waiting for my mom to come over she's
gonna do me the favor she always doesn't
me the favor she dyes my hair she's
gonna dye my hair for me and I need to
wash it and it's Gracie and it's just
like but putting my hair in a bun was
giving me such a headache yesterday but
I just need to leave it like this and I
know it looks crazy and bumpy and my mom
would cringe at the sight of this side
no sorry I know this intro is like so
long by the way it's so bright in here
I'm not sure if you can tell but the Sun
is killing right now I don't know what
it is but the Sun is like blazing
through my windows
okay enough to know if you guys know
like shut up already this is what the
box looks like this month I was looking
for this little card it's right here
the theme for this month is spellbound
but - anyway first thing in the Box is
this blue big blue team this is the dr.
Brandt pore dermabrasion pore perfecting
exfoliator I'm actually really excited
to get this because I have the black one
they have like a microdermabrasion scrub
dr. Brandt that's really really good I
keep it in my shower and I use it from
time to time whenever I want to really
exfoliate cuz that one is a bit intense
but I wonder if this is the one that
everybody raves about or if it's the
black one but I know I've heard really
good things about this one as well let
me see how this feels on my hand cuz
obviously I'm not gonna use it right now
I want to see if this one is as like oh
yeah this one actually feels really
similar to the microdermabrasion one
because the exfoliator czar tiny tiny
tiny I don't know what the difference
between this one or the black one is but
I like that the little beads are so so
tiny on this dr. Brennan is a pretty
pricey brand how much is this this is a
full-size product and this retails for
$58 does suspensive hopefully that
refines my pores okay next thing into
books is this this is from a brand
called NC la Los Angeles and I guess I
teamed up with boxycharm to create this
nailed it
kit or something I don't know let's see
oh you get a few different things in you
this is pretty cool you get your little
scissor your little nail tools your nail
clipper the little file I like this I
feel like these things are the kind of
things you don't know you need until you
have it and you're like oh my gosh we're
gonna use all of these the only thing I
don't know what I would use like what is
this I should know right I think this is
really cute really compact travel
friendly and just something that you can
throw in your purse and use like on your
nails if you need it I'm into that I'm
into that
okay and then the rest of these products
are try honorable the next thing in the
books is this and I have to say I was so
shocked when I saw this I mean boxycharm
has really good stuff in their boxes all
the time but this is a Becca shimmering
skin perfecter and this is in Prosecco
pop this is the other highlight
Jacqueline created I know she came out
with champagne pop and then she came out
with Prosecco pop I thought this was
limited edition but I don't know if they
made it permanent or not but it's really
cool that we're getting it in the box
because I don't even have this in
full-size like folks I have it like in a
face palette and love Becca highlights
they're really great they're not the
cheapest no no I didn't even tell you
what that was this little nail kit
retails for $18 and the shimmering skin
Perfector in Prosecco pop retails for
$38 let me grab my little highlight
brush okay so I'm just gonna take this
little highlight brush this is from the
brand Seurat this is like an arm and a
leg it's like the most expensive little
brush in the world but I got it on sale
at Sephora or something like that I
don't remember I'm gonna take Prosecco
pop I'm a little worried this is too
golden yellow tone for my skin tone I
think this would be perfect for like
medium skin tones I don't remember how
this looks on me
hmmm that is actually really really
pretty I didn't I hadn't remembered how
this looked on me but you know what I do
have a little bit of a tan these days am
i good and legged down I really like I
like that it's really really golden
because it is a strong gold highlight
but it's not very yellow sometimes gold
highlights can just look way too yellow
on my skin um and this one this one's
not too bad
Oh sigh hitting my nose well I think
this is the most exciting thing in the
box but let's move on alright so the
next thing in the Box is this lip liner
this is from a brand called
haunted blue you don't don't want a blue
and this is their lip liner pencil this
is a full-size lip liner and this
retails for $5 so it's a very affordable
lip liner and I got mine in the shade
brown sugar so let's try that on I
usually don't like wooden lip liners but
let's see
I'm just gonna fill this in a little bit
just like on the outer corners not too
much because there is another lip
product in the box and I'm gonna apply
that on top and I don't want the lip
liner to mess with that color too much
okay it is a little bit drying like I
said I don't love wooden lip liners they
tend to tug on the lip and can be a
little drying and I do sense that from
this product so this one is like a but
to complete this look I'm going in with
the last guy this is the Tarte hardest
lip paint and this is in the shade Home
Slice and I don't remember if these are
like the matte ones or if these are like
the creamy ones I think this might be
their matte one anyway I'm just gonna
apply that right on top since this is
very very liquidy it's kind of blending
in with the lip liner so it's creating
kind of like a darker color I'm setting
like a hundred times but they have like
this moosie formula that's very similar
like in this similar packaging and I
don't like that I don't really like
those that much but this formula feels
amazing I'm just gonna add a little bit
more to bring it more true to color
I love this color I know it has that lip
liner underneath but I love this color
so much I'm like blown away right now I
don't remember ever using this formula
and this is a full-size lip product and
this retails for $20 the Box cost $21 so
that's just crazy that was everything I
got in this month's buxi cherm the
overall value of the box this month was
139 dollars yeah guys I really love the
box this month's the only thing I was
like ant about was this lip liner oh
gosh is there this lip liner is like a
little too dragon for me not my favorite
but I really enjoyed everything else
