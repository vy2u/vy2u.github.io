this room today it's only for 25 and yet
it feels like it's six does anybody else
hate the time change now because I
really do I prefer it when it gets dark
for later does anybody else feel that
way
comment down below and love to know
anyway today's video is going to be my
October favorites and yes I am like a
week late maybe more I don't know I'm
sorry I'm usually always on point with
my favorite videos I always do it like
either the last day of the month or the
first day of the next month I'm usually
on point but I have been so incredibly
busy working like crazy so I figured I
should just sit down and film this
already before it's like November 25th
and then it would be pointless okay so
I'm gonna start off with my absolute
favorite thing of the entire month and
it is probably my absolute favorite
thing in the entire world and it is the
it cosmetics bye bye redness
neutralizing correcting cream I'm not
going to go in too much detail because I
did a whole video on this I'll link it
down below it is my first impressions
review slash demo on this product I
spend the entire video calling it a
foundation but technically it isn't it's
just a correcting cream but the
packaging does say that you could use it
alone or under makeup I use it alone
because it works amazingly as a
foundation I can seriously talk about
this for hours and hours and hours this
is honestly the best thing I've
discovered in a really long time it
comes in one shade which can be kind of
tricky I don't see how one color can fit
every single skin tone in the world
pretty impossible but it fits my skin
pretty well I love this because it could
be so full coverage yet look like you're
wearing absolutely nothing it feels like
you're not wearing anything it's
actually the foundation I have on right
now and I am just obsessed
every time I'm applying it I'm like wow
this stuff is so good and that's what
I'm thinking the entire time I'm putting
on my face I'm like my god you're
awesome you are perfect I love this it
is a little expensive
it's $32 but I think it's worth every
single penny it's one of those
foundations that cost a lot for every
reason it's I cannot say enough good
things I can my next favorite is
something I got in an Ipsy bag don't
remember which if C value it was but it
is the it's so big
volumizing mascara this is just a little
sample and I love this mascara if you
guys have been watching my videos for a
pretty long time you know that to me
nothing compares to the Clinique lash
doubling mascara it is my Holy Grail
mascara and this comes pretty close I'm
not gonna lie it comes pretty close it's
one of those fiber bristle ones which
are my favorite I'm not really into the
plastic ones it's really volumizing like
it claims to be and it's also lengthens
really well because a lot of volumizing
mascaras are volumizing but then they
stay like short and chunky and I hate
that this gives length as well which is
awesome
the only sucky part is that it's pretty
pricey I think it's like twenty dollars
and I think you should only get it
online I don't know if a store has this
brand or what but that's the only sucky
part okay so I've mentioned my next
favorite in a favorites video before but
now I use it for a completely different
reason and that is the Real Techniques
contour brush and this used to be like
my all-time favorite contour brush but I
don't use it for that anymore it's still
an amazing contour brush it really is
but this is like the perfect concealer
brush I don't know how I was putting on
my under-eye concealer before I met this
guy I don't know it just blends it out
so nicely I just add some concealer
underneath my eyes take the brush and
blend it and like in a second it's
blended it seamlessly and perfect and
then I even use this brush to set it
with some powder it's beautiful okay so
the next products are lip products and I
have been loving them they are the NYX
soft matte lip cream
and these things are so good I have this
one in Addis Ababa
or Addis Ababa I don't I don't know how
to pronounce this and this one is in
Tokyo this is like a very nice baby
pastel II pink it's beautiful and this
one is like a nice fuchsia berry color
these are really really nice on their
own they're very pigmented very smooth
and they aren't drying at all which is
awesome I love matte colors they're my
favorite to wear on my lips but I've
actually been using these on top of
lipsticks and I love how they look not
so much Tokyo but this one looks so
beautiful on top of red lipstick it kind
of turns any red lipstick matte and it
gives it like a nice hint of berry I
don't know how to explain it I love
using this on top of red lipsticks I
actually wore a combination like that in
my fall lipsticks video I wore this on
top of a really deep red lip liner and
it just looked beautiful okay so the
next product is a little shocking not
shocking because it's really good but I
have been using my philosophy purity
cleanser since I bought it
that is my holy grail cleanser to me
I don't think anything will ever compare
but I have been using this face wash oh
I said that weird face wash face wash
and it is the Olay Total Effects 7 in
one blemish control cleanser this claims
to do seven things clear your acne deep
cleansing fine line appearance reduction
poor appearance refinement gentle
purification healthy radiant skin
softness and I feel like it does all
those things I don't use this cleanser
every single day because it has
salicylic acid in it which is good for
breakouts which is why I use it
sparingly whenever I feel like my skin
needs a pick-me-up I will wash my face
with this for a few days and I feel like
it does help my skin and it does clear
up my skin and it feels so incredibly
soft it's awesome because it doesn't dry
out your skin and it is a cream kind of
cleanser which is awesome for people
with dry skin like me my next favorite
is something I got
a little sample pack at Sephora and it
is the benefit high beam I had no idea I
would love this as much as I do I am not
really into pinky silver highlights I
like more baiji gold very warm
highlights for my face so I honestly
thought that I would I don't know I
didn't know how I would feel about this
but I really like this my favorite way
to use this is actually as a brow bone
highlight I think that it gives such a
nice radiant glow underneath your
eyebrows it's what I have right now
can you tell can you see it I do also
have a tiny amount on my cheek bones as
you can see and I just feel like it
gives a healthy glow to your skin and I
love that it's kind of like a sheen and
it does not have any glitters in it
because I hate highlights that are very
chunky and glittery so this is my next
two favorites are a little ironic since
they are nail polishes and I'm not
wearing any nail polish right now they
chipped earlier today so I just took off
all my nail polish and I haven't painted
them yet but anyway the first one I'm
going to be talking about is this color
right here and it's a nice deep red and
it's called Ruby and this is the Orly
brand I know that they have Orly at Ulta
do they have some at Target I want to
say they have or the at Target I
couldn't be completely wrong I don't
know but this is probably my favorite
favorite favorite fall color of all time
every time I wear this nail polish
people are like what's on your nails
what's on your nails it's the most
beautiful deep red and I've actually
worn this in a few videos and a bunch of
people are asking you it's on my what
was on my nails I noticed this the next
one is making its way to like my top
favorite nail polishes of all time and
it is the wet n Wild mega last nail
polish in the color sugar coat this is
the most beautiful sheer pink color I
don't know how to explain it I really
think of brides unlike the kind of nail
polish a bride would wear on her wedding
day
would be something like this this would
make like the perfect base for a French
manicure it it makes your nails look so
fancy
I don't know it's so pretty and the best
part is it's like two dollars at
Walgreens and they last a really long
time on my nails I love the brush on
these nail polishes and this one
definitely it's like a fat brush like
the fat kind of brushes I love them they
coat my nails in like one swoop they're
awesome and this is definitely my
favorite color that they have it's such
a nice classy color okay I'm moving on
to my very last favorite of the month
because soon there is not gonna be any
light and you won't be able to see me at
all I'm gonna be getting on some studio
lights in hopefully soon sometime soon
maybe because I can't deal with natural
light it's just too unpredictable so
hopefully I have some like professional
type of lights and I do this because
they probably won't be perfect anyway I
have really been loving the L'Oreal
total repair 5 multi restorative dry oil
I love everything total repair 5 makes
it's like my favorite drugstore line
they have the total repair 5 damage
erasing balm that's amazing for your
hair it makes my hair so soft and I love
how that smells and if you have that
this smells oh this smells exactly like
it this says instant repair and shine
nourishes conditions lightweight dry oil
for all hair types and yes I agree this
is for all hair types even the oiliest
hair would love this because it just
gives you a nice shine to your hair
without weighing it down without being
greasy you just it's not even an oil
it's like a spray look you didn't see
that did you but it is it comes out like
a spray it looks kind of greasy but it's
not as soon as you put it in your hands
it like it does feel like a dry oil and
I just work it on my hair my hair just
looks so shiny whenever I put this on
and it makes my hair smell fantastic and
it's so cheap definitely check this out
if you want to give your hair some shine
ok so I also have eight people favorite
this month and I don't do these every
month I don't do these very often but I
just wanted to give a little
shoutout to my friend Siri she is just
like the sweetest person I've ever met

nicest person I've ever met in my entire
life

met here on YouTube and she is so sweet

subscribe she has the coolest accent and

Norway pretty sure and it's just she
does night she does a lot of halls and
she uh I don't know I just really like
her I'm like I love watching her videos
