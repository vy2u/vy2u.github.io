my October favorites these are products
I have been loving in the month of
October for some reason I feel like my
lighting is extra weird in this video
like I couldn't get it right today I
don't know
excuse that I'm looking at the products
that I have to share with you guys and
it's kind of funny because you haven't
seen me use any of these products in
recent videos like in tutorials or
anything because all my tutorials are
pre-recorded like have been pre-recorded
this month since you guys know I'm in
the process of moving I say it in every
video but these are products that I have
been obsessed with off-camera and I've
been using them almost everyday a lot of
these products and I have really really
been loving them in October like I love
them I want to mention this palette
first because I didn't think I was gonna
like it as much as I do
not that I wasn't gonna like it I didn't
think I was gonna use it as much as I do
and this is the Becca
Rose it go ombre rouge eye palette this
is what it looks like on the inside they
came out with a palette similar to this
like a year ago maybe and it was like
cool toned Browns really nice I don't
own that one but I own this one and I
love it it's so basic and simple that's
why I didn't think I was gonna get much
use out of it but I have been using it
every single day it's what's on my eyes
today I love the combination of these
three eyeshadows they just go so well
together there's something about the
combination of these three that I love
and I could pretty much use these colors
with any warm look that I'm doing if I'm
gonna do a more cool toned look of
course I don't go for this but often
does that happen I love this palette
really pigmented they blend really
nicely and I have just been using this
every time I'm wearing eye shadow in
October this is what I've been using I
have to have to talk about these I have
to these are the color pop cream gel
liners these are the pencil ones they
came out with a ton and i swatched all
of them I will link that video down
below so color pop came out with cream
gel pots and then cream gel pencils
they're like eyeliners and although the
pots are good the pencils
I'm about to make a very bold statement
right now and these are probably one of
the best eyeliners I have ever used in
my entire life
these I just have two in my hand they
came up with a bunch of colors I'm
actually wearing this one right here
this one is called show me and it's a
really pretty bronze I have this all
over my waterline on the top I like put
it everywhere like on the rim of my eye
this one's called show me and then I
have been obsessed with this one it's
called work out and it's a dark dark
dark forest the emerald green like
really dark almost looks black but you
can kind of tell it's green I love it it
just gives a different twist instead of
using black these stay on my waterline
I'm telling you I don't know what is in
this but they do not budge they don't
lose pigmentation they don't fade
throughout the day they stay on my
waterline and they stay intact the
entire day they don't get crusty they
don't break up they're amazing I like
these more than the pots and they are $5
I believe it's so affordable and the
quality is unreal so good if you haven't
checked out the color pop pencils that
they just came out with do it they're
available now and they're $5 okay so
this next product I bought in the
beginning of the month and I cannot put
it down I can't this is the new Tarte
bling it on Amazonian clay blush palette
first off do you see that gorgeous like
shimmer I'm in love with the packaging
and it's a blush palette tar has come
out with palettes like this every year
this is like the third one they released
the first year I missed out on it and
had really pretty packaging as well and
then last year it had like really tacky
god-awful packaging I really didn't like
last year's packaging and I didn't
really love the blushes in last year's
palette not only is the packaging on
point but the blushes are amazing I feel
like they finally came out with one that
works really well for fair skin or for
people who are afraid of blush because
last year's they were all so intense on
my skin these on the other hand are
fantastic I have been using this one
almost everyday this one in the middle
it's called prim it's a really pretty
like
but oh how I can describe it like a warm
Newt I love it and I've been using
beaming like crazy whenever I want like
a soft pink cheek if you have been
interested in this palette and you're
kind of debating whether you should get
it I say go for it
I don't regret it and um Sephora's vib
sale is coming up very soon I think it's
next week and I would highly recommend
this actually been really loving another
blush palette but I cannot find it
anywhere I think it's in storage with
some of my other makeup it's the elf
blush palette in light it's amazing I've
been using the peachy color in that
palette like crazy I used it in a recent
video he's fantastic and it's so
inexpensive I think it's like six
dollars I love that palette from ELF is
good this is the Clinique just browsing
brush on styling mousse my friend from
the beauty buzz hub Sarah she was
telling me she texts me and she's like
you really need to try out this product
because it's really good so that's
exactly what I did this is basically
just brow gel but in a mousse II texture
that it makes it so lightweight I don't
know how to explain it you know some
brow gels you put them on and they
almost take off the product underneath
because they are so wet and they kind of
leave your eyebrows looking wet it's
kind of weird
this doesn't do that because of the
Moosey consistency and I have mine in
the shade light brown it stays in place
all day this is a great brow mascara if
you want some thickness some fullness
and some color I really really like it
I've never been more excited to talk
about a highlight in my life let me tell
you is are the new Oprah highlighters
these were in collaboration with
the dupe fat girls and you don't know
who the dupe that girls are they are an
Instagram page
it's called dupe that on Instagram go
follow them post all the time and they
post dupes of like really popular
products I met them once and they're so
sweet so I love I love that Instagram
page even before I knew who they were I
was all up on that dupe that page so
they both collaborated with Oprah
cosmetics and they came out with their
highlights okay so this is the one I'm
wearing right now and funny enough this
one is my favorite one I like this one
more than this one they're still amazing
but this one's my favorite one but
anyway this is the one I'm wearing and
it's called you do you like Dewey DW you
do you I love the name and it is a
beautiful peachy pink I don't know if
you can tell but when you turn your pan
in certain angles it looks pink but it
has a beautiful golden peach Sheen it's
very intense
I love it and this one is my favorite
this one's called you glow girl and it's
a really pretty silvery cool tone pink
this makes you look like you are the ice
queen like you are the ice queen and
you're gonna freeze everyone and cast a
spell on the town and look glamorous as
you are turning your ex-boyfriend into
an ice sculpture that's why I feel like
when I wear this a freaking ice goddess
not only that these last on my skin like
no other highlight I own I don't know
what it is when you put your finger in
this product it feels almost creamy like
it has like a creamy buttery texture and
it just sticks on to my skin and it
lasts all day they're very very very
high quality love I don't know what's
happening with my lighting right now but
let's pretend it's not happening but I
have a 40% off discount code and you can
get anything off over a website for 40%
off you save 40% the code is Kathleen 40
I will have it written below
so another highlighting product that
I've been using since it came out
religiously is this little trio from the
balm and it is called the manizer
sisters if you are familiar with the
balm one of their like best selling
products is like the mary lou manizer
there lou manizer 's they're really good
this palette comes with a mini version
of the main
illuminizer the cinnamon eyes your end
the betty loumanizer this is what it
looks like on the inside I reach for
this little palette so much more than I
do for their full-size products to have
all of these three full-size the cindy
lou manizer is like one of my favorite
blush toppers of all time and i have
been using this non-stop I actually have
this as an eye shadow like in the inner
corners I use this one as an eye shadow
all the time all the time and then I
usually use this as blush and then this
is my go to highlight recently I just
have been using the Oprah ones but this
little palette is I think exclusive to
Kohl's and it's so worth it the bomb
gets a lot of complaints even though all
of my friends tell me that when they buy
the full size it breaks really easily I
don't know if it's just fragile but this
thing I've like thrown it all around
it's been in a box it's going strong and
I love this I think it's a really really
good buy how often do you go through an
entire highlight often this is a brush
that I have been obsessed with because
this is white it's really weird to hold
I don't know so I have been obsessed
with this brush I bought this at Target
it came in a set of four so by the way
if you don't know this is the Target
brand brush it's the up and up brushes
really amazing quality really really
soft the up and up brushes from Target
are fantastic if you want to buy really
good brushes but you want to save some
money target up and up great quality but
I love this one it came in a set of four
and I love it because it is the exact
same shape as the new Anastacio um
highlighting brush a lot of people have
been using that one recently I have it
as well and that one's okay it's not
terrible but this is pretty much the
exact same shape and it's better it's
more affordable and I love it I love it
this is what I used to highlight my
cheekbones today there's something about
the shape of this brush the way that it
picks a product that it really lays down
highlight beautifully it is worth
getting the entire set because I love
all the brushes except one and I think
the set is like it's definitely less
than $20 and you get four brushes so I
really really love this another brush
that I have been crazy about is this one
from the brand
lexy they are so cute they're all pink I
like these Lexi brushes they are really
really good high quality brushes and I
have been loving this one this is the
5:16 duo fiber powder this is perfect
for really dark intense blushes for
example the Becca blushes are beautiful
but they are so pigmented that you need
to be so careful with them well this is
like the perfect brush for that and it's
not your typical duo fiber brush where
it's like big and it's kind of like for
your whole face like a powder brush this
one is slightly tapered and it has like
a more skinny shape so I just dip this
into my blush and apply it on my cheeks
and it applies the blush really really
softly I love it and then the last brush
I want to show you what is two brushes I
really want to talk about these are two
little brushes and they are from the
brand LA Colors now my friend Melissa
got me these because she was telling me
she's like oh my gosh I bought a set of
two brushes at the Dollar Tree was it
the family dollar or the Dollar Tree I'm
not sure I don't remember Reno but she
bought this in a little set so I came
with these two brushes she got them at
the dollar tree or the Family Dollar and
they were two dollars this little set
was two bucks and she told me that she's
tried other la colors brushes and they
suck but this little set was amazing and
I was like really I've never tried it
and then she bought me a little set and
it's fantastic it's fantastic this
crease brush is so good because it comes
and like tapers at the top it kind of
comes to a point so it's so perfect to
get precise blending in your crease and
this is just an all-over shader brush
perfect for highlighting perfect for the
lid and there were a dollar each pretty
much it was a set of for two bucks go to
your local Family Dollar because these
little brushes right here they're hidden
gems my friend hidden gems okay so I
have like all my contour palettes in
storage the only one I have out with me
at all times is the Too Faced cocoa
contour kit because it's my favorite but
I recently got this and I have been
using it non-stop this is by the brand
pixie you can find this brand in the
ugh store section at Target like the
makeup and online - of course at the
pixi website but this is their natural
contour powder shape and shadow powder
and I really really like it I love it so
much I love it this is what I use to
contour my face
today I have bronzer on top of it like
to warm up the skin that I'm going to
talk about here a minute but it's what I
use to contour this gives you like
chiseled cheekbones you can go overboard
really quickly but I like the way that
it blends and it's the perfect undertone
I feel because it's not gray it's not
like literally gray where you look dirty
and ashy but it's perfect for contouring
because it's not warm it's a really
really good contouring product very
finely milled and blends really nicely
ok so now I'm going to talk about
something that very expensive
does suspense with my friends this is
the hourglass ambient lighting bronzer
in the shade luminous bronze light when
this came out I was like I'm not buying
that I don't care what any way says
about it I'm not buying it so good it's
very very pricey it's a pricey bronzer
but it's unique and it's different I
know I don't have anything in my
collection that makes me feel the way
that this does because it's an actual
bronzer like it bronzes the skin you
look like a bronze goddess
it's the bronzer I'm wearing on my face
right now it's that warm it's if you are
familiar with the hourglass ambient
lighting powders that is pretty much
what this is it has luminous light the
lighter parts of this bronzer is the
powder luminous light and then the
darker parts is the actual bronzer so
it's like a combination of like a
highlighting face powder and a bronzer
so it gives you a beautiful glow like a
sunkissed glow
they have two shades this is the lighter
one of course I have like more fair skin
but it's amazing and I'm mentioning this
because like I said earlier the vib sale
is coming up next week and if this has
been on your lists get it I want to put
it on for the first time I was like I
look like Jennifer Lopez
my mind not a real life girl can dream I
want to talk about lip products this has
been the month for me where I'm just
like wearing different lip colors every
day usually I wear like the same thing
every day
but this month I've been switching it up
and I've been wearing different things a
fordable lip option that I have really
been loving I've only worn this like
twice but I really want to mention it
because it's really good this is the Wet
n Wild mega last lipstick I was at
Walgreens like two weeks ago and I was
looking at their new display and they
had these lipsticks there and I was like
that's that's different that's new
because the packaging is different I
don't know if it's just for this
specific collection but they came out
with different packaging but I hope that
all of their lipsticks from now on come
in this packaging it looks exactly the
same but it's rubberized it has that
NARS packaging feel here on the bottom
instead of just basic shiny black
plastic I like this one more it feels
feels more like feels better I like it
so this is the shade night cap night cap
it's a beautiful vampy ready Brown
gorgeous if you are on a budget or if
you just like to if you're just like
these lipsticks because even if you're
not on the budget I'm sorry if you like
high-end makeup still these lipsticks
the megalast lipsticks are one of the
best at the drugstore and one of the
cheapest so this color is beautiful just
with a little bit of mascara a little
bit of bronzer you throw this on and you
are all up in the fall spirit my friend
I love this lipstick so one thing I have
been loving doing recently is combining
a Miami fever with a brown lip liner any
deep Brown lip liner or any like warm
brown any type of brown lip liner Miami
fever looks so good mixed with that if
you guys don't know this was sold out I
know it's limited edition it was sold
out forever but Oprah decided to bring
it back one more time just in case any
of you guys missed it Oh Miami fever
it's the liquid lipstick I made in
collaboration with Oprah is currently
still available to purchase right now
it's still limited edition and it won't
be around forever so I will link it down
below you can use my coupon code and get
40% off on it it's a beautiful beautiful
shade but I've been mixed
with brown this is a lip liner by Mac
and it is called chestnut it's a really
it's almost black it's a dark dark brown
and that is the combination I am wearing
right now this thing like I said is
almost black and then I applied mammy
fever right on top mixed my or not mixed
my lips together but I rubbed my lips
together and then they just combined so
nicely
these Oprah liquid lipsticks are really
great to mix and I just love the
combination of Miami favorite with a
deep deep deep lipstick mix which is the
lip combo I'm wearing right now I really
have been loving that and then the last
two products I want to talk about are
these two right here this is the another
liquid lipstick I'm sorry it's like PES
lean can you move on from that trend
maybe not ever
I don't know does the girl lactic liquid
lipstick in the shade below this has
been my everyday shade someone calls me
like hey come over or Danny's like hey
we got to go do something or I'm like I
gotta go somewhere I throw a mascara and
I'm usually wearing this lip color
because it's the perfect everyday shade
but it's like beautiful I really really
love it's a great formula too and I
wanted to mention this because I know
that this next product everybody talks
about Mac sore lip liner that it's
amazing I have it and I love it it's a
beautiful beautiful color the wooden lip
liners from Mac are not my absolute
favorite like chestnut is a wooden lip
liner but it's very creamy and it's
really good but I love the pro long wear
lip pencils even more than their regular
pencils these Pro Longwear ones I swear
will last through a hurricane my friends
these are so pigmented so buttery they
don't skip on the lips these pro long
wear lip pencils and they last forever
so the reason why I was talking about
sore is because they recently released
um is this I think this is a new release
actually I could be lying maybe I just
recently discovered it this could be
very old so I'm sorry but I recently
purchased this and this is like the
exact same color as soar but in a pro
longwear formula which is amazing for me
because I love it so much more this is
in control and I have a friend of mine
that works at Mac and she tells me all
the time that when they are out of sore
like if someone goes to the store and
they're like I want to buy swords lip
lip pencil and if they are sold out they
always recommend in control because it's
pretty much the exact same color and I
love it so much more so I have been
wearing this a lot underneath bashful or
by itself I really really love this lip
liner is good to my products to share
with you and then this video is complete
this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory smoothie oat
sugar and Shea breakfast scrub this has
become my favorite body scrub of all
time I do love the tea tree the tree nut
I'm sorry not tasty the tree hut brand
they make amazing scrubs but this one
this is the best morning exfoliation of
your life it's a great exfoliator before
self-tanning I haven't self tan in like
a month and a half
I'm not self tanning these days but this
is what it looks like what I love so
much honestly is the scent I feel like
I'm at an ice cream parlor when I smell
it
bananas almond and honey extracts so
just just imagine those scents on your
body it's delicious I really love it I
love the scrubbies they don't like
disappear as soon as you put them on
your body it really does exfoliate I
really really love this sugar scrub it's
amazing and then the last product I've
talked about is a pricey one this is
more of a pampering product it's a
luxurious product a vib sale is coming
up soon just saying this is strictly for
those of you who love the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana black perfume or the
Nirvana white perfume because they have
this in a white version this is the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black dry
shampoo now this is expensive okay I
love this perfume I have it in a
rollerball and it lives in my purse and
I'm always putting on Nirvana black if I
ever forget to wear perfume that's the
one that I keep in my purse they came
out with a dry shampoo and I was like oh
my gosh what else are they gonna invent
these days but I had a friend who was
like you need to try that dry shampoo
because not only is it a good Drive
but it smells exactly like the perfume
so I bought it even though it was pricey
it blew my socks off okay this is a
great dry shampoo the only thing I don't
like about it is that it does leave like
a white cast I have to run my fingers
through my hair like intensely to take
out that gray looking root but once I do
my hair looks freshly washed it like
really sucks up the oils like hardcore
so except the oils on my scalp and holy
crap guys this is the perfume
this smells identical to the perfume and
it lasts in my hair okay I put this on
my hair I put this on my hair like I
used it yesterday in the morning and my
hair still smells like Nirvana black
it's insane my mom had even asked me
like what perfume are you wearing your
hair smells amazing and it was this this
lingers in your hair your hair smells
fantastic it's pretty much in my opinion
to me this is a hair perfume that has
dry shampoo properties in it because it
is literally a perfume for your hair if
you love the scent you are going to love
this but yeah so that completes this
video I hope you guys enjoyed these are
the products that I've really been
loving in the month of October leave me
