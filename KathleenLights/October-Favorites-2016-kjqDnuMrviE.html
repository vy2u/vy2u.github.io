my October favorites these are products
I was loving in the month of October
some are old favorites and some are
newer things to me I don't have like a
ton of stuff it was kind of a more
mellow chill month for me so I didn't
really dabble into that many new
releases this month even though there
were few it didn't really get a chance
to play with that many of them but
nonetheless these products I love I
adore them and I want to share them with
you today and honestly I can't believe
it's October I was just filming my
October favorites video and it's been a
year like what Christmas is like
tomorrow it's so quick but anyway I'm
going to go ahead and get started and
the first product the first favorite I
want to talk about if you can take a
wild guess
it is the morphe and kathleenlights
palette I know this just released what I
have been using it for months and months
and months now is just when I'm finally
able to talk about it because it's out I
will link the palette down below yeah
it's me um I had to pause this video
because I had no idea that my palette
was gonna sell out before my favorites
video went up I don't think that's ever
happened with a collab of mine like sell
out that fast I am so so sorry
I cannot link it down below because it
was limited edition but I am doing my
best to convince more not convince
morphe but I'm doing my best to try to
get morphe to bring it back one more
time so I'm hoping the palette will be
in stock in the near future I'm still
working on it
but I'm gonna I'm gonna achieve that for
you guys I'm gonna do it but okay I love
you guys I'm so sorry this is like sold
out but I love you I love you love you
love you bye bye thanks just in case you
guys haven't checked it out but I love
it so much I've been using a non-stop
this is the perfect palette for every
day or for a night out I have a smokey
eye tutorial using this palette as well
there will be more tutorials coming soon
I've been using it non non non stop I do
have of course as you know a 10% off
coupon code for more feets just
kathleenlights you put it in at checkout
and you save 10% it's not a huge disc
considering this palette is only $14.99
but it's a little bit of something and
yes I've just I've been loving it so
much but you guys know this you guys ok
so I have been using two primers the
majority of the month off-camera I don't
even think I've used these on camera at
all but I love these so much and both
for completely different reasons the
first one is the it cosmetics bye bye
pores primer I didn't think I was going
to like this as much as I do because I
don't typically love those silicone pore
minimizing primer 's I go for something
a bit more hydrating but as you guys
know I've mentioned this in past videos
I'm having some skin issues at the
moment I've noticed that a lot of you
guys like oh my god your skin is getting
so much better and it has it's gotten so
much better but it's actually returning
it's coming back the past two days I've
noticed the bumps starting to rise again
all over my forehead and I thought I had
cured it but I guess not I still don't
know what's causing it but they're
coming back I don't know what to do I'm
still trying to figure it out but this
primer has really done a great job of
just evening out the texture of my skin
and I have a lot of texture issues right
now it doesn't feel super silicone II it
almost feels moisturizing and silky but
then it has kind of like a smooth
silicone powdery finish I'm not sure how
to describe the texture of this but it's
like a hybrid between a thin moisturizer
and a silicone pore minimizing texture
if that makes sense
you don't need a lot of this I find that
if I use too much it kind of looks like
a white cast on my face that goes away
once you put foundation on top but I
just like to apply this to the areas
where I need a lot of like help when it
comes to texture and pores I just apply
some right here some right here on my
forehead and then on my chin and it just
smoothes out the surface and foundation
looks so nice on top of it even for fine
lines I noticed that just just makes it
like porcelain and smooth and perfect
it's awesome for that it says oil-free
poreless skin perfecting serum primer
and I love it it has a pump I just I
love this
I think it's exclusive to Sephora not
exactly sure but I'm but I think it is
the other primer I want to talk about is
actually from the brand and money
leave money yes this is their perfect 10
primer serum I got this off of the
target website I'm obsessed with this I
am obsessed with this I heard a youtuber
talking about this I can't remember who
it was
but I remember her raving about it and
it sounded so amazing that I went out
and purchased it and I loved it it's
called the perfect 10 primer serum
because it supposedly has 10 organic
extracts to help like moisturize smooth
the skin prime the skin all that I love
it because it's so sticky and not sticky
in like a tacky weird uncomfortable way
it has the texture of a moisturizer
slash serum but then when you blend it
out on your face it starts to get a
little bit sticky and I love that
because I find that the foundation
really sticks to it and it keeps my
makeup on all day but it also helps
hydrate the skin especially me that I
have very dry skin this is so hydrating
and still moisturizing but not greasy or
slippy it like stays in place I don't
know how to explain it it's an awesome
primer so nourishing and so smoothing
but I feel like it's really really
priming my skin the kind of primers I
typically wear are just to give me a bit
of hydration but this I feel gives me a
bit of hydration and makes my makeup
stay on longer it has very natural
ingredients and you could look for it on
the target website I don't think they
sell it in store or maybe not yet I'm
not sure but I purchased it on target so
as you know I have been loving the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation because it
was the only foundation in my collection
that was able to cover up all the crap
that was going on in my face and around
my forehead but once my skin started to
get a little bit better I kind of
stopped using that on a daily basis and
this is what I've been using most days
this is the it cosmetics by by a
foundation and the only
I'm showing you this one is because in
the shade light and I don't have the
shade in the CC cream I have the shade
fair in the CC cream which is a little
bit too light for me but this is pretty
much the exact same thing as this yet
this is way more expensive like it's
they charge you like 20 dollars more for
this when it's the same freakin product
I don't understand that I have a whole
video reviewing this but just pretend
I'm talking about the cosmetics your
skin but better CC cream because it's
more affordable than this but anyway the
bye-bye foundation is what I've been
using non-stop I love it because I'm
someone who really hates wearing
foundation all the time I never put on
foundation on a day-to-day basis I
always go bare skin but when I go places
I like to cover up some imperfections
and this has been really good to me
because it's really really really great
coverage but feels like a moisturizer on
the skin like I don't feel it on my face
at all but the coverage is awesome it
also has SPF 50 which is perfect when
you go outside it's protecting your skin
from the Sun there really isn't anything
bad to say about this except the price
it is pricey but I also really love the
CC cream I just think that these are
amazing because you get all the benefits
of a BB cream or a CC cream or whatever
yet you get amazing coverage which not
that many BB creams can offer that so
I've been using this Bible foundation
like a mofo I love it so much and the
brush I have been loving to use it with
is this one right here this is from the
elf beautifully precise line they came
out with a ton of new brushes and I love
so many of them some are not my favorite
but I love so many and this one is one
of my favorites I love this for so many
different things I actually have two of
them because I use them for different
things what I mostly use it for is
foundation as you can see I have
foundation on it this little pairing
right here this little combo is amazing
this applies foundation flawlessly I
guess because of the way it's shaped it
has like this angle right here and it
just brushes the product on your face so
nicely and you could just like pounce it
in it's awesome I love it for that it's
also really great to contour with
because it has that perfect angle you
can get a really chiseled look you could
even set your powder with this it's such
a great brush I love the way it's shaped
so many different uses for this so
affordable and it actually my
I mean a lot of this guy right here this
is the Marc Jacobs the face number 2
brush it has a very very similar angle
to it the Marc Jacobs one is a little
bit more slanted and this one is a lot
fluffier so they're not exactly the same
but I get the same feel and pretty much
the same application with both brushes
and I love this Marc Jacobs brush so I'm
so glad I have a dupe or an alternative
definitely check it out on the elf
website they're really good I want to
give another huge shout out to the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer I know
I talk about this all the time
I have just realized that this is my
favorite bronzer of all time and I know
that I talked about NARS Laguna and my
girl lactic cobble those are definitely
in my top 5 but this has just taken the
place of my favorite bronzer it's the
one I go to instantly I don't really
like this when I have self-tanner on
because it is very light and I have the
darker shade out of the two they have
light bronzer and then bronzer this one
is bronzer I wish they would come out
with an even darker one but this bronzer
is literally perfect when I don't have a
tan on like when I have my natural skin
color it's perfect for my skin tone it's
not too cool but it's not warm either at
all oh my gosh I love it the bronzer I'm
wearing on my face today it just has the
perfect undertone and I grabbed this
more than I grabbed any other bronzer in
my collection and at first I was very
very into the scent but now I guess
because it smells like so tropically and
pineappley and I'm feeling very fall
these days the scent is like driving me
crazy I'm kind of worried that the scent
in this product might irritate my skin
maybe it's just what I'm telling myself
but leave me a comment down below if you
use the butter bronzer and it if it has
irritated your skin I would love to know
nothing mine is doing that but I would
just love to know so anyway I love this
bronzer and it has definitely become my
Holy Grail bronzer it is hands down the
best bronzer at the drugstore in my
opinion and probably my favorite bronzer
of all time like ever so I have two
highlights I want to mention I have been
using them both on and on the entire
month but I have definitely been using
this one the most has like my
fingerprints all over it
this is the jus a powder highlight in
the shade citrine
not with three highlights and this is
the one that I love the most I find this
one the most flattering for my skin tone
I love this highlight it's the highlight
I'm wearing on my face right now it's so
beautiful it's a very light gold so
perfect for very fair-skinned but it
looks so wet on the skin and I know
that's like weird to describe but it
does it looks like your cheeks are wet
at first I was thrown off by this
formula because I don't have any
highlight in my collection with this
formula you would have to touch it for
yourself it's the strangest formula but
I feel like that's what makes it look so
what looking on the skin this apply is
better with a synthetic type of brush so
this is the Real Techniques setting
brush
it has synthetic hairs so definitely
keep that in mind if you have been
interested in this you a highlights I
also really love the packaging even
though it gets dirty so easily I love
how it looks on the face and I've also
really really been liking the new wet n
Wild mega glow highlighting gold bar
when I saw this I was so excited it's a
very similar color to the jewel one but
this one is a little bit deeper it's not
as light this one is definitely more
golden like a more true gold color
really beautiful not as wet looking as
as UA one it's not as smooth but it
still looks gorgeous on the cheeks what
in wild has been killing it when it
comes to highlights their precious
petals highlight is one of my favorite
highlights at the drugstore if not my
favorite highlight at the drugstore they
really get it right when it comes to
highlights at least powder highlights
and this one is no exception
I love this one if you're in Walgreens
or wherever they sell wet and wild
definitely look for this because it is
amazing and so affordable okay so I'm
gonna wrap this video up with some lip
products I want to give a shout out to
the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick in the shade in know Allison I
love ashen though that's my favorite
this is Allison I know Allison just
seems like a typical color that every
brand has like when I look at this I'm
like I know I can find a dupe of this in
my collection somewhere but I just I
love this color
I have been wearing it a lot I wore it
in a recent video I've been wearing it
off camera it's just that no brainer
color for me that matches with any
outfit it's such a neutral shade but it
looks stunning no matter what you do
with your face a little bit of mascara
this lip and you are all ready and good
to go
and it matches just like with everything
or any color like this if you feel like
you have something similar in your
collection bring it out for the fall
because it's a staple and I love I just
love this color so much in the formula
of Anastacio liquid lipsticks have
gotten better I feel because I was not a
fan of them in the beginning but I
really really like Allison a lip liner I
have been loving is from the brand
Palladio you can get this at Ulta this
is a lip liner in the shade coffee it's
a really really really rich brown lip
liner and on me it looks very very dark
but it pairs so well with so many
lipsticks I love pairing it with Miami
fever about a 9.0 even with lighter
colors like if you really want to vamp
up your lip put on the coffee lip liner
underneath and it will just take it to
the next level it will make it much
darker more Brown and just perfect for
fall definitely one of my favorite lip
liners right now and I think it's very
very affordable not sure how much I pay
for this but I love it it's also a
waterproof it stays in place all day
it's one of those retractable lip liners
which you know are the best
I hate sharpening lip liners so there
have been days this month where all I've
done is filled in my eyebrows put
mascara on my top lashes and put on a
lip color and then that's all I do and
I've gone to Publix or when I've gone to
out do random things that's what I've
done recently and the lip color I always
throw on is this this is the NARS Velvet
lip glide in the shade stripped this is
my favorite one out of all of them the
darker colors are really nice but I
prefer a very very matte lip when it
comes to darker shades the lighter
colors in this are awesome I also really
love play pen that one is a really
pretty everyday pink shade but stripped
is awesome
it's the perfect light pinky nude
seriously it's the perfect light pinky
nude I love the undertone in this has
the pigmentation of a lipstick it has
kind of a shine like a mild gloss I have
just been throwing this color in my
purse and reapplying throughout the day
and then my last favorite is an ultra
matte lip from colour-pop this is in the
shade lovebug I'm actually wearing this
right now mixed with the ultra satin lip
in point zero
I mix play
zero with literally everything something
about it just works so well with every
color so I mix those two today to apply
it to my mouth but on its own it's such
a beautiful red orange more red than
orange I would say but it has like that
burnt terracotta undertone it's one of
their newer colors and I am obsessed
with it lovebug is so beautiful
especially for the Fall definitely pick
it up if you haven't already if you are
into the ultra matte lip I know that
some people aren't crazy about the
formula I myself prefer the satin lips
but I don't mind the ultra matte lip
either and this color is so beautiful
that I'll wear it no matter what so I
really really have been loving this and
yeah that completes this video guys I
know it wasn't super interesting or
super exciting but those are the
products I have been using a lot in
October leave me a comment down below if
there's a product you have been loving
in October maybe I'll check it out if I
haven't already let me know what is your
favorite bin this month like your
ultimate makeup favorite lega below but
yeah I feel so like the movie the crafts
have you seen that movie it actually
scares the crap out of me I don't love
that movie even though I've seen it like
a million times but I feel very the
craft with this choker and this dress
feel very 90s right now but anyway yeah
I guess that completes this video thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye my
skin started to get a little bit better
