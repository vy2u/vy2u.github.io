my October favorites I can't believe
that I really can't believe that for me
this is the month that has flown by like
the fastest when I was looking at my
list of products I've been loving
because throughout the entire month
whenever I noticed that I'm really using
something a lot and I'm really loving it
I always write it down on notepad and
when I looked at my notepad for this
month I was like oh my god I have like
so little products because I just feel
like the month was just taken from me no
way October is already gone I don't know
how that happened I'm shocked I feel
like I'm gonna blank him it's gonna be
Christmas I'm just gonna go ahead and
get started because even though I don't
have a ton of things to share I talk a
lot
alright so my first favorite I just have
to give a quick shout out to mommy man
that really quick to both the Polish and
my grandma I have been so blown away by
the love and support you've given mami
wata this month it is a limited-edition
shade and we have sold out but we
decided to bring it back one more time
because it did sell out so fast in the
month of October and I wanted to take as
much opportunity to donate to be CRF as
I could so you can still pick this up
and all of the profit goes to be CRF so
if you want to donate to a good cause I
will have the kale polish website linked
down below it's not the nail polish I'm
wearing on my nails right now I'm
actually wearing got a middle right now
because I was going somewhere important
and caramello is like my good luck nail
polish so I wanted to put it on for the
event so that's how I'm wearing got a
middle but anyway good stuff this is a
major favorite this month along with the
fall collection which is also currently
available so definitely check out kayo
polish if you haven't but I just had to
quickly mention that because the love
I've gotten from you guys on mommy my
thought has just been so amazing I
cannot thank you enough for helping us
do what we're doing so just thank you
it's it's been great so I love you guys
it's amazing moving onto some makeup
favorites I have been so into colourful
eyeliners but not like blues and greens
and bright colors I've been into more
burnt fall colors like this but you know
they're still colorful these are the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils
this one is in alkaline and this one is
torch and I don't know
guys I've ever trained the Urban Decay
eye pencils but they're so nice they're
very very creamy they glide on the
waterline they have a ton of different
colors I don't think they're as
long-lasting as I wish they were but
they're really really great and the
color payoff is awesome and I have been
really into these eyeliners I'm actually
wearing alkaline on my waterline right
now this one in torch can be a little
bit unwearable because it does have like
that strong reddish brick undertone so I
can totally see people hating it and
maybe thinking you have like sick eyes
but I love like red eyeliner orange
eyeliner I love that look in the
waterline especially with green eyes or
blue eyes or like hazel eyes it just
makes your eyes pop so I wanted to give
a quick shout out to these eyeliners
because I have been rocking alkaline
mostly like non-stop ever since the fall
hit I have been using this eyeliner so
much but oddly enough I haven't used it
in any of my videos I was actually at a
meeting the other day and I had it on in
my meeting but anyway I really have been
loving these colors and I just wanted to
mention them a foundation I have gone
back to and I have really fallen in love
I don't know what it is but I'm hooked
on this again this is the Maybelline
matte and poreless foundation I love
this it's the foundation I'm wearing
right now I don't know why I kind of
stopped wearing it there for a while I
mean I try out so many foundations on a
daily basis that sometimes I don't wear
the same foundation like too often but I
have been wearing this one a lot past
couple weeks I haven't been trying out
those you a foundation a lot but when
I'm not wearing that one I've been
wearing this one this month pretty much
I like this so much more than the
original fit me which is so funny
because the original fit me is perfect
for dry skin but it is beautiful it is
matte and poreless but in the most
beautiful way it has a great finish it
doesn't look drying on the skin at all
it's the most natural matte ever it just
honestly looks like your own skin
it doesn't look cakey or gross in
between my brows around my nose like
matte foundations usually do just look
so weightless yet so flawless because
your pores are really blurred with this
it does such a good job of covering your
pores and just smoothing out the skin
it's really great I love this foundation
I've been using it non-stop and I
actually picked up this pump from Mac I
this in a recent video and a ton of you
guys were like where'd you get that bump
and I completely forgot to mention it in
that video but Mack sells these generic
black pumps that you can put on a ton of
different foundations this doesn't fit
perfectly on this though I have to like
forcefully squeeze it and it still
doesn't close all the way so it's not
super secure I do get nervous about
traveling with this pump but I hate when
bottled foundations don't have a pump so
I had to get one on there and now I
absolutely love it it is perfect and I
just had to mention it again because it
is such a great foundation I'm back to
loving it and I have a new sponge to
talk about in today's favorites I feel
like every month that passes I talk
about a different sponge I feel like
these days no one really needs a beauty
blender I still have a ton of beauty
blenders and I love them I still
purchase them but the drugstore has
stepped it up so much when it comes to
sponges that you really don't need to
buy a $20 sponge anymore this one is
from la girl and it is amazing I still
love the flower one I still love the
Ecotools one they're both really great
but there's something unique about this
one I don't know if it's the flat shape
I mean I don't think so because they're
Real Techniques one has a very similar
shape to this and to me they're
different so I don't know but this
sponge gives me full coverage I don't
know how but whenever I use a damp
sponge I always just automatically
assume it's gonna share out my
foundation a little bit because it is
damp and it will suck up a lot of the
product and I'm totally fine with that
by the way I actually like that but this
sponge just gives me maximum coverage I
feel like it doesn't really soak up a
lot of the foundation I don't know if
it's the material or what but I mean
it's very squishy very soft this one's
totally dirty I just used it before I
filmed this video but it does expand
really nicely I just love the coverage
it gives me and I don't know if I'm
making that up in my head but I promise
you this gives me more coverage than my
Beauty Blender there's something special
about this sponge I have been using it
non-stop since I got it I want to give a
shout out to this product I've spoken
about it a few times on my chat a lot of
times on my channel but I have been
using it a lot recently
I feel like October was the month of
rediscovering products for me usually I
love all the new stuff but I've just
been going back to some favorites this
is the Wet n Wild photo focused pressed
powder compact and this one is in light
ivory no warm light this is pretty much
the Mac mineralize skinfinish natural
powder I wore the Mac one the other day
for the first time in what feels like
years and as soon as I was applying it I
was like oh my gosh this is my wet and
wild powder like there's no difference
between my wet and wild powder and this
Mac one they are so similar that both
very very creamy when you put your
fingers in them and very very silky it
just glides on the skin it's perfect for
those of you with dry skin because it
doesn't emphasize any texture it doesn't
make your skin look powdery like if
you've just set your face it almost just
melts right into the skin I've been
using this almost every day to set my
foundation and every time I use it I
love the finish it gives my face yes I
really love this powder I've gone back
to it I never stopped using it but I've
been using it a lot more recently and it
is so affordable and just so good so
good let's talk about some lip products
I have been love being I want to talk
about this Marc Jacobs lip gloss this is
their enamored high shine lip gloss and
this is a new color this one's called
skin deep like I said it's one of their
newest colors and this is such a
stunning lip gloss if you like cool
toned mommy type of colors you will love
this lip gloss because it is a cool
toned mommy color but it's still a nude
so it's like such a delicious color I
love it it goes so perfectly on top of
any lip liner it just makes your lips
look so juicy this formula is excellent
I know it's Marc Jacobs so it is a
little bit pricier but I feel like these
are one of the lip glosses that are
worth the money like the other day I
tried out a Tom Ford lip gloss and I was
like it's like a regular lip gloss I
don't know but this to me is worth the
money I feel the difference in the
formula it's very glossy but it's not
too sticky but it lasts a really long
time on the lips I just love them and
this new color and skin deep I feel like
is perfect for so many different skin
tones so many different makeup looks
it's not too cool but it's just it's
I highly highly recommend checking this
one out and then I have also been
absolutely crazy about this lip color
this is from M cosmetics and this is
their infinite lip cloud in vintage rose
I wore this in a recent video I believe
I haven't been wearing it a lot I love
the infinite lip clouds it's one of my
favorite lip formulas ever they're very
hydrating and they're very moosie so
they're not gonna be like a traditional
super matte liquid lipstick but they
last forever and they don't dry out the
lips they transfer a bit but I don't
really mind that whenever I'm wearing
colors like this or like lighter colors
if I want a super dark vampy lip I will
use a more matte liquid lipstick but I
love these I'm actually wearing this
right now mixed in with a darker matte
liquid lipstick I'm wearing colored rain
truffle rain mixed in with vintage rose
it's actually like the perfect combo in
terms of formula because this one is
very hydrating and this one is a little
bit drying so together it makes like a
really great budge proof matte lip
anyway
this on its own is gorgeous oh my gosh
you guys really need to try out this
formula I think you would really like it
especially the nude ones beautiful but
this color is brand-new and I love it
not only am I just a fan of this formula
and this packaging and just everything
about em cosmetics I'm also a huge fan
of Michelle Phan so I'm just so excited
to see where her brand goes definitely I
got em cosmetics I do not think you'll
be disappointed if their eyeliners are
really great as well okay so let's talk
about a product that I'm like half in
love with and half not in love with I
have such a strong love-hate
relationship with this product he's so
weird so this is the colour-pop brow
boss gel I have been using it since it
came out gathering my thoughts I have so
many opinions on this I love it
but I hate it okay I don't hate it I
actually do love it it's in my favorites
they're just a few cons so this is a
brow gel that's very voluminous it's
gonna give you literally feathery brows
if that's what you want it's gonna give
you extreme feathery brows I'm wearing
this under my brows today and it really
does just lift them and makes them
thicker like they look and feel thicker
when you apply this brow gel
well why why
you would they make the base color of
this product white it's like a white
cream can you see that it has a white
creamy consistency in it so when you
paint on your brows unless you're blonde
which I don't have blonde brows but
unless you have blonde brows you will
see the white cream on your brows and
it's not a big deal it really isn't
because all you have to do is this and
boom the white creamy stuff that's on so
weird white creaminess just goes away I
have to do is tap it in so I don't mind
that I just wish that they would come
out with something exactly like this but
like clear I don't know if it has to be
this color in order to get that really
thick volumizing formula that could be
the case I mean I don't know but I just
wanted to warn you in case you're like
what the heck why is nice why is these
white once you tap it in I love this I
think it's a great brow gel for the
price so I have been really really into
this alright so my next product is a
highlighting palette like I said it's
been the month of rediscovering ow my
finger I've gone back to old loves this
month and this is the flower Beauty
shimmer and strobe highlighting palette
I have every fallen in love with this I
cannot stop using it this gold color is
my life I'm wearing this gold as a
highlight today but right on the top of
my cheekbone like okay the majority of
my cheek is this gold color but right
here boom and boom like right at the
very top I have this like champagne
creamy shade right here I rarely use the
pink in the middle I will say it's not a
color I use that often even though it's
gorgeous but it does have kind of like a
stronger pink undertone but these two
colors I cannot stop using it I mean it
gives you such a freaking highlighted
glow it's very very very intense but
it's not thick it's not a thick powder
at all it gets so so thin and it gives
you such a beautiful Sheen to the skin I
cannot get enough of this it's so pretty
and you have three perfect undertones
right here for you I'm running into this
palette it's very affordable flower
beauty just came out with a ton of stuff
you guys have no idea I went on their
website because one of you guys tweeted
me the other day like hey what do you
think about the new setting spray or
something of that and I was like one
excuse me new setting spray what are you
talking about I went on the flower
Beauty website and I
was blown away by how many products she
released I spent I am I bought
everything I pretty much bought
everything if you want to see a full
face first impressions getting ready
kind of video on flower makeup on all
new flower makeup let me know in the
comments below I'll totally do that for
you guys but I have been loving this bad
boy and and let me introduce you to the
greatest highlighting brush from the
drugstore of all time I just recently
got this I've only had this for about a
week now so I'm totally cheating but I
did want to mention this because since I
discovered it I don't want to use any
other highlighting brush this is from
Ecotools this is their controlled
setting brush looks like this it doesn't
look like anything special but oh my
Gooch home again it is so great for
highlighting like I can't even explain
it picks up so much product though if
you want a very intense application of
highlight this is the guy for you if you
want something that's very very natural
I mean you can still use this and then
really tap off your brush and lightly
apply this but it's just the perfect
shape the perfect fluffiness the perfect
density it applies highlighter like a
freaking dream and it's such an
affordable brush you guys need to check
this out it's really great for
highlighting and what you know for
everything I just I love this freaking
brush so I've been using this little
combo right here
and it's a good one and then before I
get into my last favorite I do want to
mention these necklaces really quick I
got a lot of questions about Mike a
necklace when I posted a picture the
other day but as you guys know my sister
owns her own jewelry line it's called Co
she has really cute custom pieces all
dainty beautiful stuff they're dipped in
real gold at really good quality she
just recently launched these large
letter necklaces and I have been loving
it I love these they are so pretty and I
love layering it with this necklace
right here this one is called the pearl
of your dreams necklace it's like a
little choker and it looks so cute
layered with like longer necklaces like
this so I love layering them both
together I will link her website down
below if you want to check out the
jewelry really really nice stuff loving
everything and I get so many compliments
from people when I go out in the street
I'm not out there that often when I am I
get so many compliments on my necklaces
when I wear them especially in this k1
it's like a big hit out there definitely
check out CEO if you have not and then
the lettuce planets I want to talk about
it's my favorite okay so I have been
using it the majority of October because
I have been testing it out all month
I've been really giving this a super
fair shot and I really really like it
it's just not my favorite I still want
to talk about it because I have worn it
all month and that is a perfume I have a
perfume favorite this month this is the
new Chanel perfume that just recently
came out and it's called Gabrielle and
at first I didn't like this at all
I'm crazy and I buy perfumes online
without smelling them because if the
description sounds like something I
would like sometimes I give it a shot
and nine times out of ten it always
works out for me but this one when I got
it in the mail I saw the notes I was
like oh my gosh I love jasmine I'm
probably gonna love that and I didn't I
really didn't when I smell this in the
bottle I don't like it at all it smells
very mature to me almost too mature to
me it's a citrus for sure but it's kind
of both it's a little bit of a floral e
citrus and I was like oh my gosh I'm
gonna hate this but when I applied it to
my body and I let it dry I really
started to love this initially when you
first spray on your body it's it smells
intense it like like a little old and
you kind of feel like you're drowning a
little bit you're like oh this is this
is not gonna be good but if you give it
like a good 20 minutes and you let it
set into your skin and mix with your
body chemistry it starts to smell really
really nice and it lasts forever on the
skin I'm wearing it today and I've been
wearing it for a few hours and I love it
now I feel like when I first put it on I
was like good it smells so yummy it
reminds me so much of Chanel's chants
perfume the one that's like in the round
bottle it smells very similar to chance
I typically don't love Chanel perfumes
the only ones I like our chance and Coco
Mademoiselle I've been wearing this
throughout the entire month of October I
love this freakin bottle it is so
elegant and beautiful do I think it's
overpriced I mean totally but that's
what you get for buying a Chanel perfume
they last forever on the skin so it's
tiny and pricey like des expensive month
of this bottle I love it I'm obsessed
with perfume just collecting them
looking at bottles it's like a weird
freaky obsession so yeah guys that
completes this video these were products
I was loving in the month of October

your favorite product was in October and
