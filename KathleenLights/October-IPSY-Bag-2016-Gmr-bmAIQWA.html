my Ipsy bag and bag today is one of
those days where I didn't feel like
putting makeup on or doing my hair
putting on like you know real clothes so
I'm still in my like PJs and my hair is
so knotted so I just throw it up in a
bun just to get this video going but I
feel like bumming it out today you guys
know you have those days so I'm going to
give the same intro I've been giving in
my in all of my unboxings or whatever
subscription service videos I already
picked inside of this and this is what
the bag looks like it is the cutest
little Halloween bag I haven't opened up
each individual thing in the bag but I
did take a peek inside already just what
I can see if I would be trying anything
on because I like to apply the products
as I go to give you guys kind of like a
first impression so the first thing in
the bag is actually a nail polish I have
nail polish on so I'm not going to paint
my nails but I saw the color from this
little square and I loved it I love
these types of colors this is from the
brand coqui professional if she is a
little bit different than boxycharm in
the sense that there's not a card in the
bag that tells you every single product
like what it's called and how to use it
in the price if she doesn't do that
because everybody gets something
completely different so they can't
necessarily do that
but anyway this is from cooky
professional and it's a nail polish and
I love oh my god this is your cute cab
oh I love that that is so cute oh my god
and it has the brush exactly how I like
it it kind of has like a thicker brush
these types of colors are my favorite
for the springtime I have a serious nail
polish addiction I love getting nail
polish in my subscription boxes like I
love it how pretty is that how pretty is
that I started watching Gilmore Girls
well I mean I'm on season 1 episode 1
I'm watching the pilot I'm like halfway
through the pilot but I had to pause it
to film this video and I used to watch
Gilmore Girls all the time when I was
younger it was like my sister's favorite
show so I would come home from school
she would be watching it and I would
watch it but I would see it kind of like
in bits and pieces then I heard it was
like coming back to Netflix so I want to
give it a go and I wanted like binge
watch it so that's what I'm doing right
now now that you asked me but
you know if you're wondering like I
wonder what she'll Kathleen's
binge-watching
that's the one I'm alerting right now
all right okay so oh oh the next thing
is this this is from the brand the balm
which is one of my favorite brands I
love their packaging they're so cute and
this is the cabana boy shadow slash
blush do I have this in a full-size I
don't think so this is some time he like
a little I'm pretty sure the full-size
is a blush like that's what people
normally use it for so that is what I'm
gonna use it for today it's a really
pretty mouth tone and I'm going to take
my morphe m-46 to brush and I'm just
gonna like really dip my brush in here
once I coat the whole brush I'm just
gonna tap that off cuz that looks great
pigment it crazy good where's that from
crazy okay does that uh Cinnamon Toast
Crunch commercial I'm not where mmm oh
it's so pretty
no what I notice about the balm blushes
even the ones that are not supposed to
be long wearing are very long wearing
like I think the balm blushes are really
awesome
so that is cabana boy I think this is
really cute at first when I saw it I was
like wow that's like really ridiculously
tiny but to travel with this would be
perfect you just really got to get your
brush all up in there and it's a little
enough where it's like perfect for
eyeshadow okay so next up we have this
right here and this is from the brand
NYX it's their NYX vivid brights liquid
eyeliner and this is in the shade
gunmetal actually I've never tried these
NYX vivid bright things before geez
it's gonna shake it up Selene scratch
the crap out of me right here if you
like clawed in my face out of love but
she did and now it's like puffy under my
eye
so thanks Selene
so this is a really really pretty color
I just feel like in certain spots isn't
as pigmented or opaque as I would like
it to be you kind of have to pass the
wand a few times but it's not ugly I
actually really really like this color
I like the sparkle in it too I think
it's really really pretty okay and then
the next thing is this right here and
this is the Indy Beauty butter cream
antioxidant lip scrub so I'm so excited
to try this out it has like really
simple ingredients organic sugar shea
butter sweet almond oil coddle oil so
cool I gotta take off my lipstick I'm
actually wearing the NARS Velvet lip
glide and stripped I'm obsessed with
this it is so so good
I just dropped something I'm a mess
today I can't smell anything
oh it's very it's very hard I can't
scoop anything out so oh y'all good Oh
her whoa oh that's very oily it got in
my mouth doesn't taste bad though not
bad at all
okay so it does do a good job of
exfoliating your lips my lips feel nice
and smooth and exfoliated it's just kind
of very very oily like kind of throw me
off a bit and has a lot of sugar in it
which I like that for my lip exfoliator
but it was like saturated an oil kind of
threw me off got a little messy a little
messy but not bad it's not bad okay and
then finally the last thing is this way
yeah this is from the brand Noah I know
I've seen this brand before I think
we've got it in previous if see rags and
it is their natural lipstick sample it
says natural ingredients no sulfates
parabens or ballensat Valley
oh I'm having a flashback I know that
I've tried a lipstick from this brand
and it was this size I know I have I'm
not crazy so this is in the color
current news I'm going to pop this on oh
pretty color smells like an average
lipstick I guess
it was very smooth to apply very creamy
but it doesn't feel like greasy or
slippy slide II these colors are great
for fall so really excited alright so I
really left the bag this month I have to
say that my favorite thing even though I
haven't even painted my nails is this I
love this bottle I love this color I
hope it lasts a long time on the nails
does in the shade of heavenly by the way
