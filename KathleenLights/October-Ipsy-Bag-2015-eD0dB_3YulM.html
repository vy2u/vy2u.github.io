unbagging my Ipsy bag I have been really
sick for like the Pat over a week and
I'm getting these videos up so late
because of that I just haven't had the
strength to film had really bad cold I
even think I had like a flu or something
I mean I had a fever it was just not
cute it's not two kids I didn't like it
I did not have fun so that's why these
videos are going up so late so I tried
to cram them both and like fill them
both I'm actually about to go out to
lunch so I thought I would go ahead and
fill my empty bag while I was at it just
films my boxycharm one so let's get into
it let me sit my Cuban coffee first I am
really loving this highlight okay side
story I went to I went to Macy's
yesterday well when you're watching this
is not gonna be yesterday but whatever I
went to Macy's because the new Mac night
midnight something in the night
collection came out and they were
selling this highlight called oh darling
and they said that it was really close
to their whisper of guilt my dogs so I
bought it and I really like it it's
beautiful Mac oh darling highlight that
has nothing to do with this video this
is like the theme I'm guessing alter ego
alter ego okay this is what the bag
looks like I really like the back I like
the two-tone the gold and the black and
let's open it okay so this is the the
first thing this was like sitting on the
top this is from a brand called nourish
organic I will have prices of everything
like all the full-size like what the
full size would cost you in the
description box below like I always do
there's the nourish organic pure
hydrating argan face serum apricot and
rose hip for normal to dry skin this is
100% natural Moroccan argan oil apricot
kernel oil rose hip oil this feels
awesome
oh my gosh I might get really excited
right now that feels really amazing on
my hand
um this probably would work really well
with my skin type so I'm excited for
this gonna place that right there as I
sip my coffee it's already cold but
whatever next thing in the bag is this
guy right here and we had you know let
me hold it over here so you can see it a
little bit turned off by this packaging
it looks like a shampoo bottle like a
mini shampoo bottle that you would get
to travel with it says BWC Beauty
Without Cruelty um premium botanical
lotion fragrance free hand and body
treatment man that I can't stop smelling
things cuz I can't smell it as my nose
is so stuffy but this is really
hydrating for a lotion but I think I'm
gonna give this to my mom because I have
like 75 tan and body lotions really
impressed with the size of this one oh
my god I'm so excited
this is amazing I can't believe if she
put this in oh my god I'm so excited
this is a liquid lipstick I have been
saying that monthly subscription
services should put like a liquid
lipstick in their bag or box or whatever
because it's so popular right now and
this is the cutest little mini liquid
lipstick and from an amazing brand this
is the bombs meet Matt Hughes long
lasting liquid lipstick in the shade
committed which happens to be my
favorite chain out of all of them oh my
gosh this is so cute it's so little but
oh my there's so much product in here
though like I know I've never gone
through a liquid lipstick yet these like
lipsticks from the balm are amazing they
smell like mint chocolate chip they feel
really comfortable they don't dry out my
lips they're awesome so you go--if see
this is a mate this the back was worth
it just for this even though I have the
full-size two more things in here oh
okay so this is a I brush from royal and
langnickel it's a medium eye shader I
like royal and langnickel a lot my Holy
Grail eyebrow brush is from royal and
langnickel
and this is pink and qo and this has
like rubber I feel like I'm getting way
too excited this has like a rubber like
a NARS packaging type of feel right here

it's pink I'm gonna use this all the
time what I'm gonna use this all the
time you watch enough you can never have
too many makeup brushes right mmm

this oh this is okay this is the it
cosmetics hello lashes mascara and it's
like a deluxe version of it
