Oh
you
you
you
you
hey guys so today's video is obviously a
lip swatch video on the Oprah long
lasting liquid lipsticks now I feel kind
of bad because in the beginning of every
single video that is sponsored I tell
you guys that it's sponsored because you
guys know I'm always honest with you
guys but I always start my lip swatches
just right with the swatches you know
but today's video is sponsored by Oprah
but have you guys have been watching any
of my recent videos my opinion should
not be swayed by that fact in any way at
all I mentioned these liquid lipsticks
in my monthly favorites video I was
loving them all month last month before
Ofra even approached me to make this
video it also was highly highly
requested so I hope you guys enjoy it I
did swatch the majority of them I think
I was missing about two or three and
those colors are like blues and greens
and not very wearable shades i swatched
all of their wearable shades I did speak
about these in my favorites video but I
do want to tell you guys just a little
bit about them I love them that is no
surprise to anyone I'm wearing Atlantic
City on my mouth on my lips right now
and I have been wearing these non-stop I
wore ultimate red in my recent catch
hats video and I wore Angeles or Angeles
in my cat hats before that I wore Rio in
my favorites video and I have done
makeup tutorials using Sao Paulo and
Pasadena I'm crazy about these if you
guys probably haven't already noticed
these are one of the best liquid
lipsticks on the market I'm not joking
the formula is a little bit different
than the ones that I really love I
usually love oh my fingers are already I
usually love really liquidy liquid
lipsticks because I've always found that
moot that moosie texture doesn't really
last a long time on me but this is a
moosie ish formula but it's more creamy
than like a fluffy mousse it has like a
mousse
extra with a little bit of creaminess to
it so they last forever on my lips I'm
not joking when I filmed my cat Chet's
video where I was wearing ultimate red I
had just eaten a giant cheeseburger I'm
not proud of that but I had just eaten a
very greasy cheeseburger
and my lipstick was still intact and I
did not reapply awesome they smell like
frosting or like cake batter I like the
scent and they do what they claim to do
they're very long-lasting very
comfortable to wear because of the
Moosey creamy texture they don't dry out
your lips at all they're very very
comfortable they're not drying it's not
the kind of lipstick that applies really
wet because those tend to be a little
bit more drying and those tend to
crumble off throughout the day like a
very liquidy formula will tend to like
crumble off in sections throughout the
day but these don't these kind of just
last all day and if they do start to
wear off its kind of towards the center
when you start eating like a regular
liquid lipstick the only thing that I
would say is like huh is the price tag
they are 1950 or 920 dollars they are
$20 but they are well worth every penny
and I have an amazing coupon code for
you guys seriously amazing if you use
the coupon code Kathleen for tea I will
have it I will have it written in the
description box if you use that code you
get 40% off what is it I've never had a
coupon code where my subscribers save
that much money so it's a little bit
exciting yes you save 40% off which in
turn makes these around twelve dollars
which is amazing it is really really
amazing because I honestly think they're
worth the $20 so getting them for twelve
is a lot cheaper than a regular liquid
lipstick so I hope you take advantage of
the coupon code the coupon code will
only be around for a little while so
take advantage while you can
Oprah actually has been around for a
long time I we I have always got an
Oprah in my boxycharm and I always
thought they were good but these are so
amazing a lot of makeup artists actually
use Oprah they sell a lot of like makeup
artistry kind of makeup and all of their
products are made in the USA and they
actually include skin care
and in their makeup products too so
that's always that's always nice so yeah
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching
please please please check out these
liquid lipsticks and use the coupon code
so you can save 40% off on their entire
site then you guys so much watching
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
