currently on my mom's house and her dog
is screaming bloody murder because
that's what Darcy does so if you hear
Darcy that's Darcy so I'm giving you
guys another update video because I said
I would in a previous video
Queenie I'm filming a video weenie and
thick now so that is what I'm doing
right now
thank you thank you
well so as you guys know if you guys saw
my eye you know what I'm gonna link my
last update video below just in case you
didn't see it because if you didn't see
it I don't know if this one is gonna
make sense but I am in the process of
moving which you guys already know so we
left our previous home October first we
came and we waist started to live with
Danny's dad October 1st and we thought
that our home was gonna be moving ready
by November 10th around there we thought
that we would be in our house and a
Viper tents and then everything was
going to be good to go but as a lot of
you guys know because a lot of you guys
have been telling me things don't go the
way that you think they're gonna go when
you are in the process of moving the
issue there a lot of you guys have told
me like why did you build there why are
you moving into a house it's currently
being built and that is a really really
really long story it's not something
that I wanted to do it's just it was
convenient at the time and it's just a
really long story it's hard to explain
but we also wanted to move really really
really close to his dad Danny's had had
a heart attack last year and he wanted
to be as close to it that as possible so
we found this house and it was like it's
literally like two blocks away from his
house he wanted to be able to go and see
him every day and help him out and do
that kind of thing so it was just
convenient I'm I know that buying
pre-construction is not worth it it's
not but it's just what happened and I
don't want to dwell on it
I just want to move on and they told us
we would be able to move in November
10th and that didn't happen so we
recently were there and we're not gonna
be able to move in to new years which is
killing me because I wanted to be there
by at least Christmas like the Christmas
December I wanted to spend December in
my house because I love the holidays and
I wanted you know whatever
what so for the rest of December I will
be still filming in this
the location that you see me filming at
but I'm really sorry please stay with me
for the rest of the month I am
unfortunately because of my situation
because I can't film as much as I want
to because this is in my house and
there's tons of people here 27 million
dogs there's a lot going on
I cannot film at my luxury like I have
to film when I can so for that reason
I'm only gonna be posting twice a week
from now on
until I'm in my house I know that I said
that last time but I was able to still
post pre-recorded videos but from now on
it's looking like twice a week which I
hate I love posting Mondays Wednesdays
and Fridays I love doing the three times
a week thing but until I'm settled I
can't and I know you guys all understand
I know I get tons of love from you guys
on a daily basis on Twitter I can't tell
you what's wrong I honestly can't tell
you how much your support has helped me
with my stress and my anxiety because it
has been a roller coaster ride of
emotions and just your positivity has
made me positive you know the fact that
you guys are always uplifting I'm like
okay you know they're right I shouldn't
stress so much they're absolutely right
so that is a situation it's just a small
update I wanted to let you guys know
that I'm still in the process of moving
and this is why I haven't moved into my
house yet so I just wanted to let you
guys know please bear with me for the
rest of the month and hopefully I will
get back to my regularly scheduled
programming in January from like January
on and I'll be bringing you guys some
delicious videos then also a lot of you
guys noticed in my previous videos about
my arena because it asked me if I got a
new ring and I told you guys on Twitter
and snapchat I believe I'm not exactly
sure then he surprised me with a new
ring for our five-year anniversary kind
of like a milestone so yeah that was for
any of you guys who were asking me in a
previous video if I got a new ring so
yeah that's the situation and I am super
stressed but you guys have been helping
me a lot
thank you for your positivity hey oh
alright
so that is the situation that is with
going on I love you guys and I will see
you at my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
