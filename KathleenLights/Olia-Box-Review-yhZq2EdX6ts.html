impressions on a new monthly
subscription box I have been recently
introduced to and it is the olya box
which is a jewelry based monthly
subscription box you guys know I always
do my FC bag unboxings which is mostly
skincare and makeup and stuff like that
but this one is just straight-up jewelry
and basically it's really similar to
Ipsy in the sense then you go on the
olya box comm website and you take like
a personalized quiz and that kind of
determines what your style is and
depending on the things you choose those
are the kind of accessories you're gonna
be getting in your box so they are
personally selected accessories based on
your individual taste so that is really
cool
they have three different options on the
website they have like a limited edition
box and then they have a $25 monthly
subscription M a $35 monthly
subscription I have both the $25 and the
$35 box to share with you guys and I'm
just gonna give you my personal opinion
and what I think of the jewelry so
jewelry comes in these little
eco-friendly bags this is the $25 one
and this is Z $35 one and I actually
really love these bags are just really
great for traveling and to store your
jewelry in and they're eco-friendly
which is great has a really cute little
symbol on here which is the olya box a
little symbol and I love it they're cute
so when they $25 bag you receive two to
three jewelry pieces ranging from
necklaces bracelets earrings rings all
that good stuff so I'm gonna go ahead
and show you what's in the $25 bag so
the first piece in the bag is this
really pretty little dainty necklace
with a little bar at the end of it and
it has this really pretty like textured
effect on the actual bar on one time and
then it's plain on the other I was
wearing this in one of my recent videos
and I think it's just a really nice
simple necklace to pair with any top and
it goes with pretty much anything I
think these little dainty simple
necklaces are very in style which is
great about the olya box is that all the
pieces that they send you are on trend
pieces so you're not gonna get something
that was like super in ten years ago and
not in anymore so that's also a really
great thing and I love that it's just
not thrown in the bag it comes with this
cute little protector type of thing so
that's nice the next thing in the bag
are these little
round earrings that look like little
waffles personally I don't know where
they're really cute they have the gold
in the middle and kind of like the
chrome chrome what a collector all like
the chrome gunmetal silver are on the
outside which I think two-tone jewelry
is really cute and then it has tiny
little diamonds right in the center
these actually feel pretty heavy and
like like if they're pretty expensive I
don't know they seem very very good
quality and then the last thing in the
bag is a little ring and it comes in
this little bag right here which is nice
that it comes like in a little
protective bag and it is one of those
knuckle rings that is very in style
right now and I absolutely love it
actually really like that it isn't just
a plain ring it has a little dip right
there where it kind of looks like a
little chevron print and if you did want
to say plain gold ring you could just
turn it and then you have your little
plain gold ring
I love knuckle rings I'm gonna get so
much use out of this ring I think it's
just a great little drawer piece to have
in your collection because you could
literally wear this with anything so
that was the twenty five dollar bag
which I really really liked now I'm
gonna be showing you what's in the it's
thirty five dollar bag so the first
thing in the bag are these bracelets
they come all linked together but they
are just four little separate white
chevron print bracelets I actually
really really love this I just have a
very small wrist where things typically
just fall off
I can never buy bracelets like this
because they never fit me which sucks
but these are really really cute and I
think it would be perfect for like the
spring and summer I love white and gold
together I love it the next thing in the
bag is more of a statement necklace and
it is this nice gold and pink necklace
the chain is nice and thick and it feels
it feels like it's very good quality and
then it has these little triangular pink
triangles how good am I at this grabbing
jewelry how good but what's really cool
about this necklace is that you can
unhook it right here and you could put
it wherever you want so you can have it
right here and then wear it like that or
you could wear it close together like
this I mean the
hands on your style and how you would
like to wear it so I mean it's kind of
cool that you can adjust it and wear it
however you would like so I really
really love this necklace and then the
last thing in the bag are the matching
earrings that go with this necklace
personally I don't like to pair my
necklaces with my earrings like so
matchy matchy like this but I would
definitely wear these by themselves
because they are they're nice and
they're cute and they're pink and
they're big I like them so that was
everything in the $35 bag now I'm gonna
give you my thoughts on these bags so
overall I think they're pretty good bags
if I were gonna go with one of these I
would personally go with the $25 bag not
that the $35 one isn't good it is I
loved everything in the bag but
personally I think you get more bang for
your buck with the 25 dollar one
especially if you are on a budget and
you don't want to spend 35 I think that
the 25 dollar one is just as good and
it's fun to get customizable pieces to
your house every month especially if
you're someone like me who rather go
makeup shopping then like clothes or
jewelry shopping so it's nice to get
trendy pieces just delivered to your
front door so you're always in style
also you do get free shipping it is just
25 or 35 dollars flat you don't have to
pay shipping or anything like that and
there is a money-back guarantee which is
always great this little card also came
in the box and it just gives you some
tips on how to take care of your jewelry
and how you can make it last longer so
that's always good okay so I will link
to the website down below just in case
you want to check it out if you're
someone who's over all the makeup
subscription boxes and you want
something a little different like
jewelry if you're into jewelry and stuff
like that so I will link that down below
also I will be listing a coupon code
below which could give you a $5 rebate
on your first box unfortunately that
offer is for us residents only if you
live outside of the state you do have to
pay for shipping which completely sucks
I wish that that wasn't the case maybe
they'll change it in the future I'm not
sure so that's a big bummer because I
love my overseas subscribers all you
guys all over the world especially Paris
I really love Paris I want to go so bad
but that's a whole another issue what am
I even talking about okay back on topic
