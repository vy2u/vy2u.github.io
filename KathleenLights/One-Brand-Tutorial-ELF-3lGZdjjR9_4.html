and
hey guys so today's video is going to be
a makeup tutorial and it is a one brand
makeup tutorial I've seen a bunch of
these kind of videos on YouTube recently
and I thought I should do one
I've actually been requested a lot to
use some of my ELF baked eyeshadows in a
tutorial so I thought let me just take
it an extra step and use all elf
products so this is a one brand tutorial
using elf you can find elf at eyes lips
face comm or at Target they're a super
affordable brand everything is like
under six dollars mostly everything is
under six dollars all the stuff that I'm
using is the studio line it is my
favorite line from elf so everything is
around three bucks
and the only thing unfortunately that
isn't elf in this video is my mascara
because I don't own an elf mascara or my
under eye concealer I've tried some
concealer from elf and I'm not gonna lie
they're not my favorite so I didn't want
to use anything that I didn't like in
this video everything that I used in
this video all the elf products I use
actually really do like except the eye
liner I'm actually not a fan of this eye
liner which I'll explain in the video
umm but yeah I'm a fan of everything
else that I use I don't have an elf
mascara I've actually never tried off
mascaras before so I'm sorry that two
things are not elf but every single
thing besides those things are else this
isn't a super fall makeup this is a
little bit more like spring in your
summary like with this nude lip but I
really like the eye makeup I think is
like romantic and sultry I think it's
really pretty and I hope you guys like
it
so if you want to see this one Brad
tutorial using all elf products then
just keep watching okay so this tutorial
is going to start off a little bit
different I am going to actually do my
eyebrows using the elf eyebrow kit in
light this is actually pretty dark as
you can see like it gives me a bold bold
bold brow so I'm taking the wax on this
brush this is my Holy Grail eyebrow
brush I got this at Michael's for
two dollars and I'm just gonna run the
wax through my hair just tracing out my
natural hairs or my natural brow shape
then I'm going to go ahead and take the
powder in this duo and I'm just going to
go ahead and do the same thing and just
outline it and covering the wax with the
powder and make it a couple couples
moving on to primer I'm going to prime
my lids using the elf eyelid primer
obviously the elf primer this is just
the essential one in the shade sheer
they have like a couple different colors
this is just the colorless one once you
blend it in the color goes away I
actually like this primer it's pretty
good then I'm going to take this
contouring blush and bronzing powder
this is in Fiji their new matte duo and
I'm going to take the bronzer in the duo
and on a fluffy brush I'm just going to
buff this into my crease this is just
going to act as my transition shade
that's the best thing about makeup there
are no rules you can use blush as
eyeshadow bronzers eye shadow it doesn't
really matter so I'm just going to go
back and forth and build this color up
into my crease
so the eyeshadows I'm going to be using
in this tutorial are the elf baked
eyeshadows there are my favorite eye
shadows from ELF because they're just so
beautiful they look really nice when you
wet them but some of them look nice dry
as well I'm going to use this one called
toasted and I'm going to spray with fix+
if you don't have fix+ don't worry use
eye drops or the elf lock and seal that
works too and I'm just going to pack
this onto my eyelid I'm going to go back
and forth into that eye shadow just to
build up the color I'm using the elf
eyeshadow C brush to apply it this color
actually doesn't take a lot of building
it builds up pretty quickly but I just
wanted it to be super super intense next
I'm going to take this elf crease brush
and I'm just going to blend this into my
crease just to blend away any of the
harsh lines I'm going to take this one
right here this is called chocolate
dreams it's one of my favorites is
really deep beautiful chocolatey color
and this is one of the ones that you
don't need too wet to get a lot of
pigment from some of them definitely
need water baked eyeshadows are meant to
be wet anyway some of them definitely
need to be wet but this one isn't one of
them I just decided to add this to add a
little bit of sultriness in the eye look
I was just gonna leave toasted by itself
but I wanted a little bit of depth and
dimension on the outer V of my eye and
then I'm dragging it into my crease to
blend everything
next I'm moving on to the highlight for
my brow bone and my inner corner I'm
using the elf baked highlighter in
moonlight pearls this is a really
beautiful golden white amazing highlight
I really love these they're really good
I'm going to move on to the rest of my
face before I finish my eyes and I'm
actually going to be blending these two
things together this is the acne
fighting foundation and the BB cream the
acne fighting foundation is a little bit
like to Matt for me a little bit drying
especially during this time of year and
the BB cream is a little bit a lot
greasy but it's very very hydrating so I
feel like combining them it gives the
perfect finish they are not my exact
color but I can make it work
this is just a Coastal Scents brush I
don't know what the name of it is cuz it
doesn't have a name on it
Oh God mopping my forehead is somebody
actually pointed that out in a comment
they said that my forehead boy hit no my
forehead was annoying anyway so I'm
sorry I don't have an elf concealer I
just personally haven't found any that I
like I do not like the elf concealers at
all that's just my opinion
so I'm just using this Maybelline Dream
Lumi one because it's the first one I
saw it was literally right in front of
me so I just popped it on it's not the
best recovery dark circles but whatever
I am blending this in with my ELF
flawless concealer brush I love this
brush not to set underneath my eyes I am
going to take this under eye setting
powder it's one of those HD powders I
wasn't a fan of this when I first got it
but it actually does set your under eyes
pretty nicely I have never been a fan of
any sort of HD powder no matter what
brand because it does give kind of a
white flash back in photography but for
underneath the eyes I think it does work
and it does look really nice
this has glitter in it but it doesn't
come off on your face I'm going to
finish up my eyes I'm using this
eyeliner in copper and I'm just going to
run this on my lash line with a little
angled brush from Coastal Scents I'm
going to put this in my waterline and my
lash line as well this is a really nice
chocolatey color and I'm also tight
lining as well this next product is the
one that just wasn't my favorite it's a
little bit too goopy for me I know a lot
of people love it this is only a dollar
so I mean it's definitely worth it it's
only a book it works but it's just kind
of hard to work with in my opinion I
have other eyeliners that I feel work
better and are easier to use but anyway
I'm going to go ahead and do a wing and
then add some mascara to my top lashes
after I've done that I'm going to take
this baked eyeshadow in the shade dark
it's a little bit lighter than the
with dreams and I'm on a pencil brush
I'm just going to smudge that underneath
my lashes then I'm going to take that
matte bronzer again and smoke the under
eye just a little bit more this is just
going to help blend that baked eyeshadow
and just make it look nice and smoky now
I'm going to bronze my face I am using
this baked bronzer in Los Cabos can you
tell that the baked products from ELF
are my favorite I love their baked
products they are really good and this
bronzer is so pretty and I'm using this
on my ELF complexion brush I'm using
this to kind of contour but bronze up my
face as well I sit here and I brought my
face for like an hour I spent a lot of
time bronzing my face I also bronze my
forehead but for some reason and I don't
know if I deleted the clip by accident
or what but I didn't show it so yeah I'm
just adding some bronze
to my face to my nose to my neck to my
forehead all that good stuff I'm
actually going to be mixing two blushes
these are the mineral blushes in cabo
cabana and sweet retreat I just like how
these two look together one is a little
bit more pinky and one a little bit more
coral and I don't know I like how these
both look together
I actually really really really really
love these brushes like on another level
they are so good
moving on to highlight I am using that
same highlight I use underneath my brow
bone
this is moonlight pearls and I'm just
popping this has hops on my cheek bones
onto my nose and I'm making this stuff
and then finishing off this look I am
going to take some lipstick this is the
moisturizing lipstick and this is in the
shade party in the buff it's a very
summery springy kind of nude because it
is a peachy nude so it's not very season
appropriate for this time of year but I
still really think that the color is
nice but yeah that completes this look I
really hope you guys like this one brand
