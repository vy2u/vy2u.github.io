tutorial on this look right here
my last one brand tutorial was a full
face elf makeup look and I got pretty
positive feedback so I want to do these
more often so today I am using all
makeup forever
products my next one brand tutorial will
be drugstore so I want to do like one
drugstore one high-end and then
alternate them back and forth so today
it's high-end since my last one was
drugstore and if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep on watching
I'm going to start by priming my face
with the step 1 equalizer this is the
hydrating one this one is probably my
favorite one just because I do have dry
skin and I love how it sits underneath
my makeup then I'm going to take my holy
grail foundation not just because it's
makeup forever it's literally my
favorite foundation you guys know this
if you saw my foundation video this is
the face and body foundation it's
waterproof it lasts such a long time
it's a very sheer coverage but I find
that it does even out my skin tone and
because the coverage is kind of sheer I
do have to build it up and work with it
so that's why I am fast-forwarding this
part because if not we would be here for
like a good two minutes but I'm just
applying that with a flat top Sedona
lace brush and now I'm making this face
because when I wanted to film this video
I realized it didn't have a concealer by
Makeup Forever so I ran to the store and
I purchased one on Sephora this is the
waterproof full coverage concealer I
have mine in the shade number 4
honestly this stuff is amazing but I
think it would be better for blemishes
because for underneath the eyes even
though it has great coverage it's a
little tacky and it's a little thick so
it does crease I mean it worked
perfectly fine for me and elastic for
the rest of the day but you do have to
set it immediately because if not it
will crease because of the thickness but
hey I can't complain I'm liking it so
because I don't have a makeup forever
setting powder I
just get a little creative here and I am
using a artists eyeshadow in the shade M
500 which is like a vanilla creamy matte
shade so it's set my concealer perfectly
by the way I also put that concealer on
my eyelid to act as a primer so I
decided to go ahead and do the rest of
my face first I never do that but that's
what I'm doing and I'm going to use this
Pro bronzed fusion bronzer I believe
that's what it's called and I'm pretty
sure this one is in the shade 20 M it's
my favorite one because it has the
coolest undertone the other ones are a
lot more warm the other ones are amazing
too but this one is perfect for
contouring so I am contouring my face
using a morphe brush from their elite
collection you do have to build these
bronzers up but they apply perfectly
it's not powdery at all it's one of the
best bronzer formulations I have ever
seen and then I decided I wanted a
little bit more contour Ness like that
brush with a little bit too fat so I
picked up with the makeup geek chiseled
face brush it's one of her new brushes
and it gives you that very chiseled
contour look I'm feeling it I like this
brush so far so for blush I am using
this creamy matte brush cream brush Wow
no cream blush it's a vibrant but oh my
gosh I cannot speak today it's a vibrant
pink but I like it with this makeup look
and it's not too intense I'm applying it
with a real techniques stippling brush I
believe this is in the shade 210 or 220
but I will have everything down below
today I'm just applying a very soft
layer I don't want too much you know now
taking the pro sculpting duo in zero one
first I'm taking a stippling brush and
applying it into the bronzer just to
warm up my face a little bit because I
did want to add just a little bit of
warmth you know since the bronzer was a
little bit more on the cool side then
I'm dipping my Sephora fan brush into
the highlight shade which is the stoner
of this little duo it's a nice frosty
pinky pearly shade and I really love it
so that is my highlight and then I'm
just going to ahead and jump into the
eyes so I'm using all of the makeup over
artist eyeshadows today and the first
eyeshadow I'm using is m5 for 8 and
using this on a more feed crease brush
to just apply into my crease you know
the drill my transition shade and now my
favorite it's probably I'm not going to
lie my favorite makeup forever eye
shadow ever it's such a pretty like
eggplant purple and this one is M nine
to eight and I'm applying this with an
elf brush on my entire eye and I am
working in sections like I'm applying it
little by little because I want that
full on color so I'm just packing it on
and taking my time then on a smaller
crease brush with like no additional
product I'm just blending out any harsh
lines that like the purple created then
I'm going to take one of my other
favorites from the artist eye shadow
line and I believe it's called a pinky
Brown on Sephora but it's a really
pretty pinky Brown yes the numbering is
m500 or m600 yes m600 and I'm using this
in my crease with a Mac 217 just to blow
it out and then I'm going right back
into the purple and just intensifying it
because once you start blending other
colors in the crease the lid shade kind
of disappears a little bit so as you can
see I'm going back and forth with those
two colors just to intensify everything
and then I'm taking that same vanilla
shade I use to set my concealer and I'm
using that as a brow bone highlight and
then I'm taking something a little bit
shimmery err because everything is so
mad I wanted the brow bone just to have
a little bit of shimmer and I used I for
one for for that now in a pencil brush
I'm applying this to my lower lash line
and then I remembered oh I wanted to put
eyeliner and I forgot to do that so this
is a make up forevers eyeliner in brown
and I'm just applying that on my
waterline and then I'm going right back
to doing what I was doing earlier so
this is like a morphe pencil brush and I
just applied that purple all across my
lower lash line then taking a bigger
pencil brush and dipping it into pinky
Brown and just smokin that out so for
liner I am using this graphic liner I
actually bought this with the
chin gray or like fifty shades of gray
collection I bought like during
Christmas and now is when I'm getting
around to using it it is so black so I
just applied my typical like small
little wing and then I'm going to load
on the mascara this is the smokey lash
mascara no smoky extravagant mascara and
then I am using that same shade I used
under my brow bone the eye for one for
just to intensify my inner corners so we
are almost done but now to do the lips
I'm taking this lip liner in the shade
1c and I am lining my lips and then
filling in my lips as well and then I
wanted something a little bit more on
the cool side like I wanted a cool toned
lip so I'm using this aqua Rouge it's a
liquid lipstick basically and this one
is in the shade number one it's like a
super gray cool toned liquid lipstick so
I only dotted some in the center and
then blended it out with my finger
just to make it a cool toned lip but not
like super gray so that completes this
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
