ready with me kind of video for the look
I'm wearing right now and I say kind of
video because I wasn't really sitting
there and chatting and talking about my
day it's kind of like a tutorial but I
don't know I I tried my best to make it
as chit-chatting as possible but this is
probably like a fail of what a chit chat
video consists of but anyway it's on
this look that I'm wearing right now and
I personally am obsessed with it I could
totally understand if this is completely
out of a lot of people's comfort zone
it's basically just orange eyelids and
it's very very warm and I know that that
can be a little scary to some people
orange straight-up orange eyelids I know
I just really love warm colors that's
just like what I'm about I will totally
rock a bronze smokey eye over a silver
one any day so yeah if you want to see
how I got this look then just keep
watching okay so I'm doing things a
little bit differently today usually I
always do my eye makeup first just
because I hate having foundation on and
then you do your eye makeup and you get
some fall out and kiss on your
foundation and it really really annoys
me so I always do my eye makeup first
but since I'm not going too crazy on my
eyes today I'm gonna do my foundation
first so I'm going to start by priming
my face I'm using the chafing relief
powdered oh by Monistat which every time
I use is someone's like but why are you
using that as primer but it is a very
nice primer especially that you can see
that especially if you like those
silicone type primers this is like pure
lip
so it's really really nice to minimize
your pores it works really well I like
this stuff
okay so the foundation I'm going to be
using today is my Revlon Colorstay and
so so ugly but I love this foundation I
get the one for a normal to dry skin
because I have dry skin
this is 250 fresh beige this here on me
this is my ultimate favorite foundation
ever my pre-match lumi comes in in
second place with this one
I do love a little more I just don't use
it as much because I like a more dewy
glow in the summer and I really love
using this foundation with the Beauty
Blender I feel like it gives you more of
a dewy finish so that's why I like it
I know some people I like girl $20 on a
sponge that's a bit that's a bit much
but honestly um this puts on my color
safe foundation like nothing else
because a lot of people don't like B
Colorstay foundation because it's so
thick not thick but it's so um yeah I
would say thick and sometimes it can
come off looking really unnatural but
with the Beauty Blender I honestly don't
look like I have makeup on I mean I can
tell that I have foundation on obviously
because I'm the one who put on my
foundation but it gives me a natural
look to my skin okay so once I have my
foundation on I'm going to go ahead with
concealer and I'm using the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer it's honestly the
best under-eye concealer in the world in
my opinion it does increase it doesn't
settle into fine lines it's like heaven
in a bottle so the only thing that sucks
about this concealer is that you don't
need a full pump and sometimes it's hard
to get half a pump out of this thing
by the way I know that my hair is like
what does it want to look nice does I
want to look ugly I don't know so I'm
just going to take the concealer and put
it underneath my eyes and then blend it
out
and I love to have my under-eye
concealer like two shades lighter than
my skin tone just because it really
brightens up that underline it makes you
look awake and I love it looks a little
scary right now but hello
so I also like to take whatever is left
on the sponge onto my chin and right
here in between my eyebrows and on my
forehead a little bit just like right
here not like on my whole forehead the
fact that the Beautyblender is wet kind
of helps you blend out those like
concealers or those foundations that
seem like really hard to blend I you
know you might say like colors day or
like the crawling or concealer since
they're a little bit thicker it's kind
of hard to blend like with a brush but
the beauty blender makes that easy
as always I'm going to set my under eye
concealer with my MSF natural in medium
this is um my favorite face powder it's
my only face powder it's the only one I
found that doesn't take up on me on my
dry skin so I grate my brush is totally
dirty so you know what I'm just going to
use the Sigma e-40 and I'm going to set
my concealer with that
I'm only gonna be setting the places
where I put the concealer I don't like
to set my whole face with powder I
rarely ever do that I'll do that
sometimes but I don't like how my
foundation looks sometimes when I set it
with a powder um I really like the dewy
finish and I feel like it lasts a pretty
long time on my skin even with that
powder okay so I'm going to bronze and
you know do all that good stuff after I
do my eye makeup I just wanted to put
like my foundation I'm a concealer on
first so really quickly I'm gonna fill
in my brows with with my Mac's cork it's
what it's what I always use to fit in my
brows if I'm not using like my Anastasia
brow Wiz but just going to go ahead and
do like the natural route like always I
just don't like really bold eyebrows in
the summer I just I just don't so okay
so for my eyes I'm doing a very very
orange eye so first I'm taking my Urban
Decay primer potion
and then I'm also going to be adding a
base I'm using the NYX eyeshadow base in
skin tone and I'm using this over like
my pain early Paint Pot that I would
normally use because it's like yellow
based and painterly paint-pot is more
pinky so I want this to have more of a
yellow type of base if that makes sense
okay so I'm going to start off with a
transition color and like in my crease
and I have been using this brown color
in my wet n wild vanity panic palette
like crazy I think I use this as my
transition color every single time I've
been doing my makeup recently it's the
perfect color for me and I like it
because it's like a peanut buttery shade
but it comes off really really warm and
I love that almost like a hint of orange
I don't know if you can tell not really
orange but just very very warm
the orange eyeshadow I'm using is max
rule it's like a very burnt orange it's
my favorite orange eyeshadow ever so
first I'm just going to take a 239 brush
to really pack on the color and then I'm
going to kind of like blow it out with
another brush
okay so now I'm taking my Mac 217 and
I'm just going to blend that out
I'm going to be going back and forth
with this eyeshadow just to really blow
it out so this takes a while I just kind
of go back and forth with that eyeshadow
and make it as blended and smoky as
possible
now I'm just taking my NYC bronzer and
sunny this is a very very warm I shadow
it's not like eyeshadow bronzer it's not
like a orange bronzer but and it's very
warm and I'm just going to use that same
217 brush and put this in my crease
I'm going to take an angled brush dip it
into that orange eyeshadow and run it
extremely close to my lash line
I want to do a really blown out lower
lashline a little bit dramatic so I'm
going to take the pencil brush and dip
it into my bronzer again
and just put that all over the place
oh don't stab your eye though actually
going to take my 217 and dip it back
into the rule you can't see that so
they're back into rule and put that
underneath my eyes crazy I know
you go back in with that pencil brush
but again with sunny
okay so because my eyes are extremely
max I'm going to go in with a very
shimmery highlight like you know very
intense I'm going to use Mac's nylon
right here and use it underneath my brow
bone
okay so for my inner highlight right
here I want something a little bit less
in your face and for that I'm going to
use shroom right here
okay so I'm pretty much done with Irish
shadow and I'm just going to take my see
less much sick in damsel it's just like
a dark brown and I am going to put this
or you would normally put like winged
liner
sorry my husband was screaming like a
maniac on his xbox while I was doing
that so probably didn't put that part in
but basically I just drew a pretty thick
line on my upper lash line I didn't wing
it out or anything
and I tight lined with it as well I'm
going to be using this cello ivory lace
highlighter in my waterline okay and now
I'm just gonna add my Jordana bus lash
extreme mascara and I will be right back
okay so my eyes are completely done now
and I'm gonna move on to bronzer I'm not
going to contour or anything I'm not
even gonna add blush I'm just going to
be continuing the same warm theme here
and I'm going to take the same bronzer I
used on my eyes and I'm just going to be
putting this on my face and I'm using my
Coastal Scents brush it's like I don't
know what it's called as a honey I love
this brush so much I literally use it
for everything
I guess I'm kind of contouring a little
bit but it's I'm using it kind of like a
bronzer and blush kind of just putting
it on my cheeks
okay so now I'm going to highlight and I
want it to be very very gold so you know
just to keep in terms of the theme I've
got going on here I'm going to actually
use an eye shadow in my stealer in the
light palette and I am taking this color
here called bubbly it's just like a very
light gold color and I'm going to use
that as my highlight
okay so I am done with the face and now
for my lips I am using two lip products
I'm going to be using Revlon's smoked
peach as my lipstick but I'm only going
to be dabbing it on very lightly because
for some reason this lipstick can look
really neat on Orange on me don't know
why but she's going to be dabbing it on
lightly okay and then to top that off
I'm going to use the NYX butter gloss in
creme Brule
this smells so good
okay guys so that's it this is the
finished look I hope you liked this
