my part to to my luxury makeup hits and
misses video I posted part one already
and if you are watching this video that
means that you guys wanted to see a part
two I will link part one down below in
case you didn't see part one basically I
bought a ton of makeup in the past like
six months from luxury brands some of
this I bought way before that and I'm
going to be going over pros and cons of
each product Celine's hair basically
giving you a review on each product if
it's worth the money or if it's not
because all of these products are really
really pricey I already gave a
disclaimer in part one but just in case
if you don't like luxury makeup if
you're someone who is not interested in
super super super ridiculously
ridiculously pricy makeup and this video
is not for you I have a ton other
affordable videos on my channel but for
those of you who are super into luxury
makeup and you guys requested this this
is for you I'm going to be extremely
honest I'm always honest but I'm going
to be very very very brutally honest
with the reviews because some of these
are just not worth the price in my
opinion while others are but some of
them are not so today we're going to be
talking about YSL Charlotte Tilbury Dior
Chanel and Georgia Ramani
I completely forgot to include Marc
Jacobs and Kevin Taquan I have a couple
of products from those brands too so if
you want to see a part 3 in the future
maybe in like a few months let me know
okay so I start off with Charlotte
Tilbury which is probably my favorite
luxury brand I'm gonna start off on a
high note because I love this product
this is the Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder this is in the shade medium
there's only one thing I don't like
about this product and it's the fact
that there's three shades I wish she
came out with a bunch of different skin
tones like there is not a color for deep
skin like really deep skin I wish you
would expand the line because this
powder is amazing I raved about this
powder in the past I don't use it as a
powder foundation I kind of use it on
top of my foundation if you have dry
skin this is beautiful
it doesn't emphasize the dryness I love
it and I highly recommend it whether you
have oily skin dry skin normal skin
mature skin young skin oskins this stuff
is um diggity okay so next up is a
product that's like
and these are the eyes to memorize cream
shadows I have the shade Cleopatra in
the shade Jean these are stunning okay
they're very very beautiful they're just
cream eyeshadows you know she has a ton
of different colors and they're stunning
the only thing is that I find that there
are a lot of dupes out there on the
market there's a lot of brands that have
the same kind of product for a more
affordable price and they are also the
same you know quality these are $32 and
I don't know I think you can find
something pretty similar at Sephora that
isn't as pricey as these even though
they are pretty they're just like I
don't know you know I'm saying even you
get me okay so back to loving a product
out of all of my makeup this is one of
my favorite makeup products out of
everything I own and this is the
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow this I love the
packaging first of all I love Charlotte
Tilbury packaging I know a lot of people
told I think it's beautiful a lot of
people say it's kind of like old ladyish
but I think it's like vintage that's I
don't see it as old lady I think it's
like vintage and classy and mature and I
looked this comes with a mirror and then
it comes with a bronzer and a highlight
the sculpt and the glow this is perfect
I love the undertone in the bronzer it
really does carve out my cheeks really
nicely it gives me a nice contour but
it's very smooth very buttery so easy to
blend love it and then I love this
highlight I actually tried it out on
camera for the very first time a while
back and it definitely gives me that
Jennifer Lopez glow it gives me like a
beaming but lit-from-within kind of
highlight it's not glittery at all
there's no shimmer in this it's just a
true sheen and I highly think it's worth
the high price tag I really do a
highlight that I don't so much think
it's worth the high price tag just
because of the packaging this is the
skin gliding highlighter in the shade
bar of gold I love the idea of this
because it's literally a bar of gold how
cute is that and the product inside is
awesome very very intense but so nice I
really really love the actual product
which app really that's what counts
but it's cardboard like the packaging
it's a little bit cheap especially for
it being Charlotte Tilbury and it's a
very very small highlight so it's up to
you to decide if you think this is worth
it or not I love
the color but some people really had a
problem with the packaging and I totally
I understand why okay so my next
Charlotte Tilbury product I have a lot
of CT I got a lot of CT products these
are her cheek to cheek blushers I'm
obsessed with these I'm wearing this one
on my face right now I hadn't owned this
one and then I heard my friend Laura
from mrs. Lowell in I heard her talk
about this the other day and how it was
her favorite out of all the trials
Hillary blushes and I was like I thought
on that one so I bought it on Nordstrom
and I'm so glad I did this is probably
my favorite one I'm so glad I bought it
this is in the shade love blue gives
your cheeks a pink shiny golden glow
it's so stunning I love this and then I
have this one called first love and then
I have two more I think ecstasy and love
is a drug or something I'm not sure they
totally look like nipples I know they
look like a boob which is so strange but
they're so pretty the idea of these
blushes is that you take your brush and
you like swish and pop in the middle and
then you apply like that I honestly just
like these blushes are so nice they last
forever on my skin and I love the
formula they're very very smooth and
buttery
unlike the Tom Ford blush that I have
that's very powdery this one is just so
smooth to the touch and they last a long
time on my skin personally love these
blushes you cannot go wrong with them
they're so good this next product is
kind of an end for me this is the magic
foundation I used to have the other
foundation from Charlotte Tilbury but I
gave it away to one of my friends
because it was her perfect color and she
left it so I just let her have it but
this is the magic foundation it's her
newer foundation I feel like it's okay
there's nothing I love about it but
there's nothing I really hate about it
either and for that reason I don't
really reach for it that often because I
have a ton of foundations I like more it
doesn't do anything special for my skin
kind of settles a little bit here yeah
it's a it's an a you know and then the
last Charlotte Tilbury product I have to
talk about are her lipsticks I love her
lipsticks so much this is in the shade
nude Kate but I have a ton of her
lipsticks are actually all sitting right
here I get questions all the time like
what are those lipsticks the front row
is Charlotte Tilbury I'm going to have
some sitting on the corner and then the
back too
those are two-faced you can't go wrong
with these lipsticks they smell really
really nice they're very very creamy
they last on the lips and they just feel
really good I really like them and
they're not as pricy as other luxury
lipsticks good stuff
okay so now let's talk about George your
money this first one is going to be no
surprise to you because I've kind of
commented on it a few times on my
channel this is the Georgia Armani
luminous silk foundation thankfully they
sell a smaller bottle like this on the
Sephora website now which is why I
purchased it I've purchased this in the
past and didn't really like it and then
I repurchased it again it's like what I
keep this because I think it looks
beautifully right off the bat like when
I put this on I'm like wow my skin looks
beautiful I love how it looks but like
I've said before this makes me look like
a greasy hot dog after like three hours
and I have dry skin I don't get it so
for that reason I don't think it's worth
the money because I like my foundation
to look pretty throughout the day and
this one just does and it gets it breaks
down way too quickly now unlike the
luminous silk foundation liquid the
luminous silk compact foundation is
amazing I feel like I'm about to hit pan
on this not really but I've used this so
much I think this is phenomenal this is
the powder foundation I have on top of
my koujun doe aqua foundation this looks
flawless on the skin I like it just a
hair more than the Charlotte Tilbury
powder it has a little bit more coverage
and it's a little bit I don't know I
like it a little bit more I can pack
this on like a mofo like I could pack it
on and it never looks cakey and for
somebody with dry skin that's amazing
for a powder oh baby
the single one I bet this is worth the
money in my opinion I think it's so good
so this next Armani product is like I
actually don't I don't really love it
actually this is the Sun fabric sheer
bronzer this is what it looks like I
really love the color of this which is
why I'm leaning towards like and but I
don't really like the formula it's a
little bit powdery it's not as smooth as
the bronzers I spoke about in part one I
have a ton of bronzers I like way more
than this my Too Faced milk chocolate
Soleil or the chocolate Soleil is better
my electic Cobo is better than this I
almost want to return it because
I have a hundred bronzers and there's
only so many bronzers you need in your
life and I don't think this is anything
special whatsoever next up is the
maistro' liquid summer this is so good I
do prefer my cover FX custom enhancer
drops in the shade Sunkist if that one
has a little bit more of a neutral
undertone this one is amazing if you
like a very warm bronzy look to the skin
it almost has like a hair of Sheen like
it gives you a subtle glow to the skin
this is in the shade 100 and I actually
really love this I think that it is
worth the money because it makes you
look so glowy but natural at the same
time since it's a liquid product but it
blends really well with a Beauty Blender
I don't know there's nothing bad to say
about it really I like it way more than
the benefit do the hula which is like a
liquid bronzer I like it way more than
that one as well
so this does get a big thumbs up from me
personally I think it's awesome okay
let's talk about lip products really
quick this is the Rouge ecstasy lipstick
in the shade three oh three I love red
packaging red is my favorite color so
anything was like red packaging I think
it's so nice this is what the lipstick
looks like it's just a nice peachy color
I don't like this that much I find that
it's a sheer formula it's nice but it
doesn't last long on the lips the scent
I'm not too crazy about it I prefer my
NARS audacious lipsticks way more than
this and they last way longer like I
don't think there's anything special
about this formula personally or this
color maybe you just got a whatever
color that made me not love it but I
just I would recommend other lipsticks
is all I'm saying okay so I have a few
YSL products to talk about first up is
the volume effect faux sills mascara I
love this mascara I think it's so good I
do prefer my Kiko one which is 14 bucks
versus this I think this is like 30 but
I'm not gonna fake the funk I think this
is beautiful it makes my lashes look so
voluminous but they don't make them
crunchy like they make them really soft
and wispy I like the formula a lot of
this I will continue to use it
I don't know if I'll repurchase it maybe
because I think it's nice it doesn't
flake on me at all either which is
really nice because I used it on my
bottom lashes too and I didn't have any
flaky problems let's talk about a
product I despise I don't just like I
despise and that is the Rouge pur
Couture lipsticks and I mean
all this these lipsticks in general not
just this color this color is actually
so pretty this is number 10 uh I hate I
very much hate the scent of these
lipsticks I don't get why so many luxury
brands put this floral scent in their
products I'm like trying to smell it it
really bothers me and it lingers on my
mouth through the entire day so I cannot
wear these lipsticks I have two colors
and I just I don't wear them I lost my
receipt character I don't I don't like
them and it ends up giving me a headache
I'm very sensitive to floral scents in
my lipsticks don't know why but I am and
therefore I don't like this don't think
it's worth the money these lipsticks
though I actually really like these are
the Rouge voluptÃ© shines these have a
very very fruity scent to them I
actually really really like the scent of
these and their sheer but they give such
a beautiful shine to the lips I really
liked the veloute shines the packaging
is so beautiful too like that just looks
so nice sitting on a vanity even if you
only have one just sitting there just
looking at you all pretty this next one
is a little bit newer to me I just
recently purchased this on Sephora and I
was surprised at how much I loved it
this is the to shake la lumiÃ¨re divine
highlighting finishing powder and this
doesn't have a name does it I just think
there's one color this when you look at
it it almost looks like a face powder
for very fair skin it doesn't have a
shine to it or anything and even when
you swatch it on your hand it looks like
nothing like when I first got this in
the mail and I swatch it I'm like oh
what the heck is this but when you take
a brush and when you put it on your face
it looks so pretty in the most natural
way I would say 90% of the highlights on
the market will emphasize the skin or
the texture underneath because it's
literally highlighting your skin this
one doesn't do that this one reminds me
so much of my Laura Mercier baked powder
highlight and zero one only this one is
even more natural but it's still so
beautiful I actually wore this the other
day without any makeup on I just wanted
to look a little bit dewy but like I was
actually naturally dewy
you know like my skin was naturally like
that and this did that for me it really
really did it didn't look like I was
wearing highlight at all but in certain
angles in certain light it looked really
nice and it had that subtle shine
obviously if you
you are like medium to deep skin tones
this won't work for you but if you are
light to like porcelain I think this is
nice okay I'm trying to speed through
this video because I feel like I've been
here for a million years next brand to
talk about is Chanel I personally think
Chanel hits it out of the park with
their perfumes I have the Coco
Mademoiselle and it will last days on me
it lasts even after I shower I will
smell it after I get out of the shower
and Chanel perfumes lasts forever on the
skin my sister wears chants by Chanel
and I'll be with her all day and I'll
still smell chance on her at the end of
the day perfumes they do it right makeup
I'm not super impressed with like this I
bought when I hit 500,000 subscribers
this and this it was like a treat to
myself this is the LeBlanc de Chanel
multi-use illuminating base it's their
primer and it's okay I prefer my Too
Faced primer I prefer actually I prefer
a lot of the primers I have over this
one I never use this it's just sitting
on my shelf as decoration honestly as
like a reminder of me hitting 500,000 I
used to like it when I first bought it
obviously I was just excited to use it
all the time but I just realized it
wasn't doing much for my skin it made my
skin a little bit glowy a little bit
more luminous but I have a ton of other
ones that are cheaper that do the same
thing so and then the sole a tenday
Chanel this is a cream bronzer I've used
this maybe like 15 times and I've had it
for like two years I don't use it that
often because I have other bronzers in
my collection I prefer this does look
really beautiful on the skin really
natural the packaging is so pretty I
actually really like this packaging it's
just so fancy and whenever I think of
using a cream or liquid bronzer I go for
my cover FX one but I know a ton of
people who use and abuse this and love
this to death the last Chanel product I
have is the labeling de Chanel this is a
mascara this is a mascara I'm wearing
right now I freaking love this mascara
this gives you so much volume like wow I
opened up my eyes and makes my eyes look
so voluminous and big I love it I like
this one more than the why is someone I
think it gives you a lot of volume I
think it's so I think it's really good
okay in the last brand I have to talk
about today is Dior I have quite a few
products from Dior actually
first up is this bad boy right here I've
spoken about this before on my channel
this is the door skin ear flash spray
foundation this stuff is fantastic I'm
afraid that this breaks me out I've used
it a hundred times but for some reason
when I wore this my makeup geek
photoshoot when I took off my makeup
that night I had like four huge pimples
on my forehead and I don't know why
because I have used this a million times
before that and I never had a breakout
so I'm kind of weary to use it
especially since I'm having some skin
issues these days I don't want to use
this but this stuff looks literally
airbrushed like you look flawless like
I've worn this any time I needed to do a
photo shoot I framed this picture of me
Mandy and Patrick and I'm wearing this
foundation in this picture this is the
foundation of Waring's if you want to
look like a porcelain doll in photos the
Dior air flash on nation is amazing I
spray it on AB you blend draw on my hand
and then I'll go in like that and you
literally look flawless there's no other
way to describe it I think it's amazing
and totally worth the money I know it's
super pricey but this like about a dr
product i think is so crappy i don't
like this at all
this is the eyeshadow palette in the
shade taupe design this comes with like
a cream eyeshadow and then for powder
eyeshadows the pigmentation is not that
great on these eyeshadows at all this
one right here is just pure glitter the
hairs I even like the Tom Ford quad that
I spoke about in part one more than this
there are wet and wild I shadow from the
drugstore that have more pigmentation
than this and this is like a $60 little
thing like what not worth the money at
all at least not taupe design like this
specific one zero pigmentation why are
you so expensive for no reason
like what no a product I do love this is
the Dior show brow styler brow pencil I
really like this is what's in my brows
today I bought this because it was a
twist of brow pen so kind of like all of
them are but it doesn't have a cap and I
like that because a lot of the times
with brow products that have two caps I
always put the cap on the wrong side and
then I end up squishing the pencil part
but I really like that the packaging is
like this I love the spoolie I love how
long it lasts on my brows I like that
it's not too
waxey it's just like the perfect
pigmentation and I think it's really
really really good it lasts like forever
my brows good stuff okay so my next
product is a highlight by Dior and this
one is the nude era Luminizer in 0:01
very similar to the Burberry highlight I
spoke about in part one like the golden
shade only this one is a little bit pink
e'er it's like a gold with a pink
reflect almost this is the highlight I'm
wearing on top of the Tom Ford highlight
but I'm just going to add a little bit
more so you can see this is beautiful
and this is limited edition so I'm so
sorry that I'm talking about this but I
missed out on it when it first released
and then they released it on sephora's
website or was it Nordstrom I don't
remember and I don't know if it's still
available but if you can see it I would
snatch it up because I actually do think
that this is worth it I think it's so
pretty look let me add a little bit more
I don't typically love these kinds of
formulas that have like the hard powder
cut that it's like not powdery but this
one is so glowy and beautiful and the
fact that it has kind of like a pink
undertone but it's still a little bit
golden makes it really unique in my
opinion and I really really like this
this next product I'm not too crazy
about this is their Dior Addict lip
Maximizer it's kind of like a limp lip
plumping gloss I think it's okay I have
a ton of other glosses I prefer like I
said in my other video the buxom full-on
lip creams way better than this and I
just don't find this to be anything
special it's just like a pinky clear lip
gloss and you can find that in a ton of
different brands so that's not like
worth it in my opinion it's like
whatever this product is the Glo
Maximizer Lite boosting primer I got
this cuz my friend Laura raised about
this and I really really like this it's
a shimmery golden primer so at first it
might be a little scary because when
you're applying this to your face it
could look shimmery but once you blend
it all out you just look golden and
glowy it's so nice sometimes the formula
can get a little bit too thick like
right here it'll get stuck in the pump
so you have to pump it out like two or
three times to get the gunky stuff out
which I don't like about it because
you're wasting product that way and this
is expensive so
the only downside to this product but in
terms of formula I really love how it
looks underneath my foundations and it
does give a nice glow to the foundation
I put on top so really like this stuff
okay so then the last your products I
have to talk about and the last product
I have talked about in general is the
rosy glow healthy glow Awakening blush
in 0:01 petal this is one of those
blushes you guys know I feel about those
kinds of blushes that when you open it
has this little thing right here I don't
like it when companies put a little
brush in the blush compact I know it
doesn't bother a lot of people but for
some reason it really irritates me but
this color is actually really unique to
my collection
so I really like it I don't really have
a blush that looks like this and at
first when I bought this I think I
bought this because of SC button or it
might have been emily noel 83 I am Not
sure this blush looks scary in the pan
but when you lend it out on the back of
your hand or on your face obviously on
your cheeks it gives you just like a
soft pinky fresh youthful glow to your
skin perfect for the springtime of
spring and summer it like makes you look
awake the formula of this also is really
incredible it almost feels like a pore
minimizing face powder you know like
those poor powders feel like this feels
like that feels so smooth and it looks
so smooth and just beautiful on the
cheek so I look past the packaging
because I really actually like this
blush okay guys so that completes video
this was part 2 of my luxury makeup hits
