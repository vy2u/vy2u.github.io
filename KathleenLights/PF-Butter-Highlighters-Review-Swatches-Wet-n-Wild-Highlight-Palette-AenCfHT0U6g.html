be a quick simple video I've gotten so
many requests to share my thoughts on
the new Physicians Formula butter
highlighters ever since they came out I
mean I've got in so many messages I've
gotten tweets everything comments so
many people want to know what I think
about these and that is what today's
video is gonna be about I'm gonna share
my thoughts on these new highlights I'm
gonna tell you all about them my
favorite ways to apply them yadda yadda
yadda and then at the end of this video
I'm gonna show you swatches on the new
wedding Wild mega glow highlighting
palette I just got this in the mail last
night and Wow but we will go over that
after today's video is mainly about
these butter highlights so as you guys
know Physicians Formula first started
out with the butter bronzer I love this
bronzer so much I feel like this is the
best bronzer they've ever created I'm
wearing this bronzer on my face today
ever since I came out I have just been a
huge fan of this it smells like a
tropical vacation like sunscreen and
coconuts and it just smells so summery
it's the perfect undertone it's so
smooth it flies beautifully it's great
and I feel like people went nuts over
that bronzer and they kind of have
created more products to the butter line
they also came out with a butter blushes
I'm not sure if they have more than
these but I have four of them and even
though this packaging is super bulky I'm
not huge on the physician's formula
always has packaging like this and then
they have like a little brush that I
really don't ever use but besides the
packaging these products are so good the
butter blushes are amazing as well they
did not disappoint me I'm actually
wearing this one on my face right now
it's called vintage rogue and I love it
it's matte but it's not a flat matte it
has such a pretty finish all of these
bushes apply really beautifully they
don't feel chalky at all like such good
formula love the butter blushes as well
so when they came out with these butter
highlighters I almost peed in my pants I
was so so excited these were sent to me
by the way and these are the more more
butter highlighters and I'm not sure if
you guys know but all of their butter
products are made with more more butter
I don't know if I'm even saying that
we're right movemove
but er I hope so even the bronze are
like everything has more and more more
butter in it and if you didn't know more
more butter how many times have I said
that word in this video already it has
like fatty acids and vitamin A and it's
supposed to be really good for hydrating
and it even has like antibacterial
properties and it's just supposedly
really really good to hydrate the skin
it's good for sensitive skin it's
organic it's just a really really great
ingredient and I think that's what makes
the highlighters so creamy because it
kind of did throw me off at first but
these highlights are not the same
texture as the butter blushes or the
bronzer it is very much a cream product
when you touch it with your hand it's
very very creamy almost like I don't
know how to explain it it's almost like
wet it's just a very strange texture but
it's definitely a cream product and then
when you start to blend it on the skin
that's when it kind of has more of a
powdery finish but it doesn't remain
like sticky or wet or tacky or anything
like that it does dry down it's a very
strange formula and at first I didn't
know if I liked it but the more I played
around with it the more I'm starting to
know how to use it learn how to use it
and I really do like these I have four
shades and I am gonna swatch two of them
on my cheeks just so you can see how
they apply to the skin and the only one
I could really really 100% get away with
is the lightest shade in Perl it's
perfect for very first skin this one and
the gold one the only thing with the
gold one is the gold one has a little
bit of like a bronze undertone that is
just a hair too deep for my skin tone
but I still use it I can still get away
with it you just can kind of see it a
little bit and then these other two are
a little bit too deep for me this one in
pink and this one in rose gold the rose
gold one is so incredibly beautiful if
you have medium to deep skin tones this
is the one this is the one for you it is
stunning I love it okay so I zoomed you
in just so I can show you the products
better I did want to mention something
really quick I did get these sent to me
in the mail I already said that but this
one in pink was like leaking and I just
want to point this out just in case it
happens to any of your highlights if you
order these if you buy this this is the
only
it happened too but it kind of melted
this I don't know if you can tell here
on the corners but it kind of melted it
got all mushy on one side of the
highlight and it stayed super liquidy
here and then it just kind of like
started seeping through the packaging
let me see if I show you of it put my
finger around this do you see that
that's just like pure oil it is
extremely oily here on the outside of
this product which leads me to believe
that is like the more butter melting or
something I'm not sure whenever I close
this my hands get a little bit oily it's
so weird but it only happens to this one
in pink so I don't know what's up with
that but just keep that in mind in case
you are looking into these but anyway I
have two ways to apply this highlight I
don't like using a Beauty Blender I've
tried using a damp sponge a dry sponge I
just don't like how that works and I
thought that was gonna be my preferred
method because I love applying cream
highlights cream bronzers and all of
that with a sponge but for these since
the consistency is a little bit
different I either like using my finger
or a brush and it has to be a synthetic
very very stiff dense brush this one is
from colour-pop I'm not sure what it's
called
I so wish these brush has had a number
on them at least like comical about how
you gonna make brushes and not give me a
number or something I named something on
it but anyway I like using this brush
because it's very small very dense and
it's synthetic so it will pick up the
products better but I will say the best
way to apply this is with your fingers I
know a lot of people hate applying
things with their fingers but I just
find it works the best for me I'm gonna
apply the champagne shade on this side
of my face you can see it this is what
it looks like I'm showing you arm
swatches as well but this is what it
looks like and you know what I'm
actually gonna do this side with my
brush and then this side with my finger
and then I will go over the gold with
the pearl since the gold is just a
little bit a little bit too deep for me
so I like mixing the two colors wait let
me take a sip of my coffee first okay so
I'm gonna take champagne on my little
color pop but now I'm just gonna
stippling
that is so beautiful I love using this
brush I've tried a few other brushes and
they just didn't work for me but I love
this one because it's nice and dense as
long as you find a synthetic brush that
is very dense that is the key they have
this butter and they are so borderline
and oily the best thing about that is
that they're not glittery it's just a
straight-up sheen on the skin
they're very reflective and highlighting
and you don't get anything chunky or
weird like oh my gosh I love love that
high way I'm gonna apply this to this
side of my face you have to be careful
you can get carried away and apply it
too much with your finger I feel like
that's exactly what I just did and I
don't know if you can tell maybe I'm
just being dramatic but do you see what
I mean is just that it's a little bit
too deep for me you can kind of see it a
little bit there but I feel like I could
totally make that work right I just love
that color so now I just want to apply
it a little bit of the pearl shade on
top and I'm going to do the same exact
thing on this time I'm gonna use the
brush I feel like my perfect color would
be literally a combination of these two
like mixed in with one another I think
that's how I'm gonna start using these
literally mixing both of them because
it's a cream it'll probably look really
cool just for poops and giggles I'm
gonna apply the Rolle's gold shade to my
lid and then maybe like the pink one in
my inner corners why not I'm gonna I'm
gonna just use my finger for this
that is actually very very pretty okay
I'm gonna take a little bit of pink
which I have to be honest is the shade I
like the least just because a bright
pink highlight is not my favorite I like
highlights with a pink undertone but
like pink
like this not my favorite I'm gonna take
a little tiny synthetic brush this one
is from dose of colors and I'm gonna
apply oh I picked up way too much this
one is like extra extra creamy I don't
know what it is this color is very very
pretty very reflective it's just very
pink so I would only recommend this to
those of you with like a deeper skin
tone so if I have really been enjoying
these butter highlights I love
discovering new goodies from the
drugstore
even though Physicians Formula has
always been a little bit pricier than
other brands and their stuff can be very
hit or miss their color selection is
garbage all the time like feel like they
really need to improve in other
categories but some other products
recently especially the butter products
have really been impressing me and I'm
not sure if these are available forever
I don't know if they're limited edition
I don't really have any information on
that but they retail for 10 dollars and
95 cents and besides the pink one I
really really really love these I
usually don't like cream products that
much I just feel like they're an extra
step they're a little bit of a hassle
but these are pretty easy to use and
before in this video I just I got this
in the mail and I got so excited that I
just wanted to throw it in this video
since I'm already talking about
drugstore highlights this is the new wet
n Wild mega glow highlighting palette
how amazing is this so I had no idea
this was even happening I had no idea
this was coming out it says it's a
collection of our fan favorite mega glow
highlighting powders in for new vegan
limited edition shades infused with
shimmering pearl pigments these
highlight powders give a glistening glow
yeah yada yada you know they're just you
know you know how highlighters work and
this is so exciting
gives me a Nastasia glow kit vibes
obviously it's a little bit more cheaply
made it's a little bit lighter the
inside has like this black plastic
insert
nothing and you can definitely tell it's
a bit cheaper but I mean it is it costs
a lot less than a glow kit now I
actually have no idea how much this cost
because this was sent to me with
absolutely no information last night I
don't know when this is releasing I
don't know how much this cost I don't
know I just know that I got it I know
it's coming out and I wanted you guys to
be the first to see it it's amazing how
a brand like wet and wild who has such
affordable products I mean it's one of
the most affordable brands at the
drugstore for them to come out with like
a cute little pellet like this I mean I
think it's I think it's a big step in
their brand I'm not crazy about the
color selection in this not gonna lie I
know they were probably making it to be
like colorful and fun you know it has
kind of like a greeny gold it reminds me
of that mermaid one that they recently
just released actually I think this one
might be even more green than that
mermaid one anyway they have four new
shades in this palette you get diamond
Lily sweet peony blushing Azalea and
wild cosmos and the only ones I really
really like are the top two it's just at
the bottom two personally for me our
colors I wouldn't normally wear and both
of the ones on the bottom have like a
significant amount of glitter in them
like you could look at it and see the
chunky glitter while the two on the top
are a little bit more of a sheen
especially this shade sweet peony it's
my favorite in this palette I think this
whole palette is worth it just for sweet
peony it's so so pretty you know I'm
just gonna douse myself in this
highlight I'm he's a different brush
this color is magnificent I already have
so much highlight on so it's not gonna
make like a difference but
obviously obviously nobody would ever
wear their highlight like this I look
freakin ridiculous hold on okay but I
mean this is proof that this color is
super intense and beautiful anyway I
think highlights are really becoming
more of a trend at the drugstore I think
they're really stepping up their game
when I first started my youtube channel
there were very little highlights at the
drugstore but now I feel like you can
get a lot of options do I love this
palette no because I don't wear
highlights like this but if they
released a palette with like more
wearable highlight shades oh my gosh
wait a while if you're watching you for
listening
make a palette just like this but with
like more golden champagne peachy like
neutral shades as well I don't I don't
know something a little bit more
wearable but anyway this is a step in
the right direction I love this I got so
excited when I saw this I had to share
it with you guys I have no idea when
it's gonna come out I will keep you guys
updated anyway guys that completes this
video I just wanted to share with you my
thoughts on this new wet and wild
palette but mainly I wanted to give you
my review and demo of the new Physicians
Formula butter highlighters and I just
love drugstore makeup it gets me very
excited even more excited than high-end
makeup I love high-end makeup for
packaging alone like it just gets me
like high-end makeup
packaging is so beautiful but man
quality wise the drugstore has been
stepping it up and I I'm very impressed
I love the drugstore but you know this
asparagus that completes this video I
hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much

haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye

tickling my eye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
