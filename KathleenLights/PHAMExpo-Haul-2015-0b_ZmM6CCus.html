my fame expo hall
I cannot take myself seriously because
how tan I am I can't say what so
seriously I don't think you guys have
ever seen me this tan I have like a lot
of bronzer on but holy crap and also I
have come to the conclusion that those
lights behind me just do one work
anymore don't buy your lights at forever
21 okay let's try to look past the fact
that I am way too tan actually I have
self-tanner on loving tan ultra dark and
it never makes me this dark but I was
already naturally tan by the Sun before
I applied this off tanner so I was like
double the tan I lived a little scared
I'm scaring myself okay anyway
this past weekend last weekend was Fame
Expo and I got a bunch of stuff I was so
busy Saturday and Sunday because I was
with boxycharm like I went I flew out to
LA with boxycharm so I was doing like my
meetup I didn't even get a chance to
really see any of my other friends or do
anything like that because I was like
doing like the meet appease stuff but I
just quickly wanted to tell you guys
thank you so much for every single
person who came up to me at Fame Expo I
was kind of blown away last time I was
at IMATS a lot of you guys came over to
me but I was like shocked at how many
people came up to me like shocked and I
was so sad to see you guys like are my
ears like white and my face tan I was so
sad to see people like waiting in line
oh my god I hate that like there was a
line and I know that that's how like
made up to work but there was a line for
you guys and it just drives me crazy the
fact that there was even a line I hate
people waiting just to meet me it like
creeps me out like you shouldn't have to
wait to meet me like just if you can all
like group hug that'd be great so I'm so
sorry that you guys had to like wait I
hate that but thank you to everyone who
hugged me a lot so like you guys were
all really sweet really nice you guys

came up to me and certain things and I
just want to say that I have the best

one of you thank you to those of you who

thank you thank you thank you thank you
thank you your positivity makes me a
better person to make person makes me a
better person it makes me more positive
in life and I love you so I just wanted
to say that so thank you so I can't stop
looking at my tan because I look it
doesn't look normal
let's jump into everything I got because
I bought so many teens okay so the first
thing I was so excited to see I didn't
even know sauce box was gonna be at Fame
and as soon as I saw socks socks socks
box I ran up to their booth and I
immediately looked for the battle ash
palette and they had it so when is the
first thing about you don't know a
battle ash is like a group of girls here
on YouTube it on Instagram mostly
Samantha is I love Samantha so much so I
went ahead and bought the palette just
to support them and this is what the
palette looks like it's so pretty
and it comes with humongous freakin
eyeshadows I think these are the exact
same size as the makeup forever artist
eyeshadows they're huge there's a lot of
product the palette were like $60 $64 I
think which is expensive for eight eyes
shadows but you do get a lot of products
and I wanted to support the battle ash
teen because they're amazing and like I
said I like to support other youtubers
but I think the quality is on point I'm
actually wearing this on my eyes with
some other stuff that I will show but
yes I am very happy that I got my hands
on the palette because I didn't order it
online because there was like a huge
like online crazy thing like it got sold
out and stuff so so happy to see that it
was at Fame alrighty then I got some
morphe brushes these are actually gifted
to me by Linda
I met Linda I love Linda so freakin much
I love the morphe people they're amazing
so I got more of their branches so thank
you Linda because I mean I clearly
didn't have enough brushes already so I
went to this boost that was selling like
B'nai and makeup forever and like other
stuff and I noticed that Kevin Kwan was
there and Fame X was very very similar
to IMATS where like everything is
discounted so I really take advantage up
at these places because I get a discount
and I love sales especially on makeup so
when I saw that Kevin upon was there and
it was discount and I was like
absolutely 100% I got the celestial
powder in the shade starlight
candlelight was there and I feel like
candlelight is a lot more popular but I
find fine that this one is prettier like
I have things that look just like
candlelight you know so this is what
starlight looks like it's a very pinky
peachy highlight and these are normally
like 50 bucks almost and it was on sale
for like $26 at Fame so took advantage
of it and it's very little for the price
but it's a beautiful beautiful highlight
um Lady Moss was there lady misil lady
boss Beauty was there and I love Coco
lashes they're so similar to house of
lashes and house of lashes are my
favorite lashes so they're pretty much
they're like dupes Koko lashes are dupes
for house of lashes and they're like
half the price so I got some of those I
got three of the Koko okay these are all
coca lashes but I got three of these and
goddess this isn't a style goddess
they're like ridiculous
they're so big and like intense I would
only wear this I'm like a crazy dramatic
night out and I got three in the style
Mila which these are more I don't know
if you can tell these are more natural
yeah they're just like honestly like
basic natural looking lashes like
they're not there they don't have much
wisp to them or or depth but there
just nice like basic everyday lashes I
mean I would never wear them every day
but you know and then I got three of my
favorite style and I got Misha
these are my favorite ones these are
super wispy and kind of like individual
looking a little bit like doll they look
like doll lashes I love misha's so I got
three of those then they had these
eyelashes sitting right next to the Koko
lashes and I had never heard of this
brand before these are called posh
lashes they look identical to red cherry
which I love red cherry because they're
like a couple of dollars and they're
really good so they had these and they
were 10 for $13 so I got 10 of the exact
like the same exact ones 10 lashes in
the style
WSP which is wispy they're all whispies
but they're beautiful like when I saw
these instantly I was like those are the
prettiest wispy eyelashes I've ever seen
like I like him better than our dough
and everything they just look perfect um
I walked over to violet Voss because the
owner of my lip boss is like so freaking
sweet and she gave me I actually didn't
buy these she gave me a few of her
little pigments but I think these are
glitters I don't think these are
pigments
yeah they don't look like I suppose they
look like little glitters so she gave me
a bunch of these amazing glittery things
from violent boss and she gave me like a
lot more than these but I shared with my
sister I gave half of them to my sister
so yes amazing and then she also gave me
this this is the violets secret weapon
loose pigment and glitter adhesive I'm
excited to see how good this is okay so
then I went to oh by the way also I
forgot to show this um at Lady Moss I
bought the Koko lashes brush on lash
adhesive because this looks really
similar to the House of lashes one it's
even latex-free
which house of lashes is latex-free and
this is a brush on just the same way the
House of lashes one is so I'm really
sided because house of lashes adhesive
is my favorite lash glue ever so if this
is a dupe for it yeah
all right now my favorite thing about
like I'm at and fame Expo is that name
ease is there and name ease is 40% off
40% of odds amazing room so high when la
crisi I went straight straight to the
Laura Mercier section at Namie's because
I freaking love Laura Mercier but that's
a sensitive and for 40% off like I go I
go his Sam ham so I got the foundation
primer from Laura Mercier and I got it
in radiance bronze because I have the
radiance one which I have recently been
using under like all of my foundations
this radiance one it's so glowy and
beautiful and then I was like oh I want
the radiance bronze one for the summer
time so I picked it up and it's very
good I really like it it's that bronzy
color and you might think like oh that
looks really similar to the bronze me
the cream but this is actually like more
opaque this actually goes on like a BB
cream and this is bronze but it kind of
sheers out so it only gives you like a
slight warmth to the skin which I really
like to use it kind of like on its own
because that BB bronzer is too dark to
use on its own but this is sheer so like
I blend it out of my face and it gives
me glow and a sheer wash of bronze so I
used it underneath my face today and the
wrong the darkness has nothing to do
with this but I really like it so far
and then I got this if you guys saw my
foundation stash video you knew that
his openness more I have this bad boy
this is the regular laura mercier silk
cream foundation they recently
discontinued this and reformulated it
and now they have one specifically for
dry skin and one specifically for oily
skin so they have a moisturizing one and
an oil-free one and of course I am dry
so I wanted to try it out because I
don't love this one I picked up the silk
cream moisturizing photo edition
punished and now the packaging looks
like this and I have mine in sand beige
they don't like the colors don't
correspond I self-tan the day right
before Fame X well like I'm still dark
so when the girl matched me I'm such an
idiot like I should have said like okay
I'm like two shades lighter than this
normally but she color matched me to my
like fresh tan which is sand beige which
is the color on my face so I mean
clearly it matches as you can see but I
have to have a fresh Air's pan in order
to wear this but I loved it I loved it
so much more than this this one is light
weight it's not as thick it's not as
moosie it's a little bit more
lightweight it blends better my skin
looks a little bit glowy it can breathe
it's like moisturizing I love this
foundation I am definitely going to go
to Sephora soon and picking up a lighter
color because I can only wear this like
one my tan is fresh okay more stuff and
Namie's I went to the dose of colors
booth with the intentions of picking up
another liquid lipstick but for some
reason none of them called out to me I
have so many liquid lips of Normandy so
I was looking at their baked
highlighters and there was one that was
like more pinky like another one that
was more for my skin tone but I decided
to go for the dark one this one is in
the shade Sunkist this is perfect for
very dark skin tones like medium tan to
dark skin tones if you are a woman of
color a beautiful chocolate goddess this
will
look amazing on you like amazing this is
what it looks like it's called sunkissed
arteries of it and this is the highlight
I'm wearing on my face but I am using it
as a blush now my normal skin color I
could never wear this on my face because
this is way too dark but it is a nice
like oranjee Goldy blush topper so
that's what is that's what's on my face
that's I used it as a blush but also as
a highlight that's the glow like all the
glow on my cheeks is this and then I
also used because it has a more
white-ish gold and then it has an orange
Eagle can you tell like this is orange
and this is like a white gold
it's a marble pattern so you have to
like mix it all together but then you
could also kind of use it in little
sections so I dabbed my eyeshadow brush
in like the copper orange shade and
that's what's on my eyelid as eyeshadow
and I don't have anything in my
collection like this I'm actually right
after I film this video I'm going to
clean out my makeup donate to donate
some stuff and then things that I
wouldn't donate cuz they're gross I'm
gonna throw the Moy I'm literally going
to clean out my stuff so I can breathe
again while I buy more makeup okay more
name ease I got some more stuff I mimis
I don't even think this is out yet well
he says with the girl at the counter
told me I looked at this and I was like
I don't need it but the more I looked at
it I was like maybe I do yes I'm crazy
but she was like oh we're selling out
fast and that's not available to the
public yet so you can buy it here early
before everybody else can and I was like
okay I'll buy it so this is the lorac
pro matte palette why I like it is
because it's really really little and um
it's really little and it's cute and
it's so sleek it comes with eight
eyeshadows um but they're nice i shadow
they're all matte has a white one one
like the color of my skin when I'm not
tan and then it has a pinkish crease
color and then a neutral more cool toned
Brown crease color and then have a
burgundy reddish
beautiful color and then two Browns one
is more warm one is more cool tone and
then a matte black so I think it's very
versatile and I have like these two
colors in my crease and I have that's it
oh this is my brow bone highlight this
white I really like it I don't love the
lorac formula in there eyeshadows
because there's a lot of kick up but
they're very pigmented so I like it I
got three because it was 40% off because
I know this is gonna sound excessive but
I bought three of the Beauty Blender
solid cleanser I go through these like
water I have tried every dupe out there
like the dr. Bronner's or something the
soap and I don't love it it dries up my
uh it dries up my brushes
I love the solid cleanser I use it so
much I got three because it was on sale
two more things I got at Mimi's I got
this from girl lactic even though I'm
friends with the owner gleet and she
sends me things I like to buy things
from the people I like so I bought this
star shadow and the reason why I bought
this is cuz when I saw it my sister and
I were like that would be a really
beautiful face highlight and I was like
absolutely and it's such a big eye
shadow that it even looks like it could
be like a mini highlight well this is
what it looks like it's so pretty it's
like a pinky champagne not as pink as
the Kevin Kwan one but this formula is
so buttery and it's such an intense
sheen that there's no glitter no
chalkiness it doesn't accentuate your
skin underneath it's such a pretty color
and it's the perfect size to travel with
as Anna you know highlight an eyeshadow
on a brow bone and inner corner
highlight a face product I like it
and then the last thing I got at Namie's
I was so excited to see this so of
course you know my obsession with Jaclyn
hill and everything she recommends I buy
it everything she was wearing this
foundation in her snaps recently and I
think she's mentioned it on her channel
this is the Elsi foundation with green
tea extract white tea extract and
vitamin E it says to shake well before
use use fingertips but I'm not gonna do
it
um Jacqueline did say that this is a
very like matte
combination but you know I like my
radiance primers and everything so I'm
sure I can make it work the packaging is
so pretty look at this bottle it is so
pretty I haven't used it yet so I don't
even know if I'm gonna like it I don't
know if it's gonna work with my skin and
again I'm stupid and she matched me to
my self tanning shade actually I think
this is a little bit lighter so maybe
it'll work for me it almost has like a
serum II feel I feel like it's gonna be
mad I don't know I'm really excited to
try it out I hope it's good but I was
excited to see this on namings I didn't
know that they even sold this any me so
it was 40% off so I decided to take the
blunt and try it out so I got two
foundations because you know I'm more of
a drugstore foundation girl but I wanted
to like branch out okay so that's
everything I got at Namie's I went to
the anastacio booth and I picked up I
bought two more bra whizzes in dark
brown because their brow products or 20%
off I think so I got backups of my
favorite brow is and then I went to
cinema secrets and I got there quick
drying rinse free makeup brush cleaner
this is a spot cleaner it's not like an
actual like brush cleaner like this this
is just a like spot cleaner brushes
honestly I love it because it smells
like vanilla like like MAC lipsticks it
smells delicious and then I got this to
pour it in it's just like at in the open
you pour a brush cleaner in and then you
dip your brush into it and then go like
this on a towel and then clean it and
then BOOM okay so then I went to this
little counter that had like a little
section of jouer cosmetics and I got
this it was our mayor I got this it was
in a like a little trio set and this is
their cream highlighters um and my
sister and I got the last ones we were
so excited we were like oh my god we
almost miss them they're so beautiful
they come in a set of three because they
connect let me show you what they look
like this was in the show
camellia camellia yeah this one is in
the shade tiara or tra and this one is
in Champagne I thought was really cool
like to travel because there are three
different color highlighters okay so
individually they look like this they're
like little squares as a schooi on them
and make a neck like this look look look
ah let me try that again
so they connect like this and then they
are three highlights I've already
swatched them but they look like this so
it's a really beautiful gold like
straight gold highlight a super intense
pearly finish like a pearly white wept
kind of highlight looking and then a
beautiful pinky peach so this is perfect
to travel with because you have three
different highlights their cream
highlighters so they stay on the skin
for a really long time and then the last
stop was melt cosmetics I was so excited
to find out the melt was there because I
could only get melt online and I have
the melt dark matter stack which looks
like this and I love it these are our
shadows the coolest packaging ever it's
pretty pricey it's like 48 dollars for
four eyeshadows but they're huge I
shadow and they're really cool indie
brand and I like I don't know I like
them I like these people
they're awesome so I bought that and I
wanted to buy the lovesick stack but I
didn't think I was gonna get much much
use out of it those are definitely my
kind of colors but since they were there
and I'm pretty sure they were on sale
I'm not exactly sure because I was kind
of dizzy looking at all the melt stuff I
don't know if they were on sale I think
they were yes so I went ahead and got
the lovesick stack so pretty the only
one I don't think I would get much
yourself of it is this one because this
is like pure red the other one in the
dark matter stack is like a burgundy
this is like red but these three colors
are so beautiful they are so pigmented
umm and then I got three lipsticks I had
never tried to melt lipsticks before but
I hear they're super matte and super
amazing so I got this one in the shade
laced and it's the lips like I'm wearing
right now it's the one that I really
want
and I was scared it was gonna be sold
out but they weren't this is what it
looks like I love the packaging matte
black and sleek it's very similar to max
stone now that I like of it look at it
are these the exact same color cuz I
have stone and that would have been away
some money but it's super matte but not
drying on my lips I don't feel it dry at
all and then I got this one in bang bang
which is the one I really really wanted
as well because it's my kind of color
just wait till I show you you're gonna
be like oh yeah that's your kind of
color it's like a it's orange it's like
a pure orange and I've always wanted a
super matte vibrant orange just like my
Kat Von D a go-go liquid lipstick but I
wanted a lipstick not a liquid lipstick
that bang bang and then I got this one
which I'm nervous I'm not going to love
it because super nude colors when
they're matte aren't very flattering on
my lips but it was just sitting there so
pretty like a bump here this is in the
shade nude and I like how they spelled
it n oo D what it looks like so it's
really pretty I love that they're matte
and I love matte lips and that is it oh
that is everything I got it Fame it's a
lot of stuff but I snagged a good deals
everything looks like on sale I love you
