quick mini review demo sort of
application type of video on the brand
new Physicians Formula butter collection
palette this bad boy right here I'm
gonna tell you all about this I'm also
gonna give you guys a little bit of an
update why I've been missing if you
don't follow me on Twitter or Instagram
so I'm gonna leave a little time stamp
right here right in here letting you
know what the actual review starts
because I do want to talk to you guys a
little bit before I get started because
I miss you haven't seen you in so long
I actually have been gone for like eight
days I went to Las Vegas we went there
to celebrate Danny's birthday and it's
just there's been a lot going on I've
been traveling mainly for work but we
did want to go to one of our favorite
places in the world to celebrate Danny's
birthday so that's what we did to kind
of disconnect from work stuff for a
while and I did a lot of pre recording I
just didn't do enough I knew there was
gonna be a video missing like sometime
last week but I also couldn't post a
video of this in Monday because I had a
video pre recording I didn't had an
edited it yet so I had to wait till I
got back home so I'll be posting that
video later this week and I'm so sorry I
know things have been rocky but like I
said in the beginning of April I told
you guys April and May we're gonna be
really really intense I was going to
probably miss a couple uploads I feel
like it's a pretty good in April but I'm
traveling even more in May and I leave
again in about a week for her work and
stuff so it's just been a lot it's been
a lot and you guys know how I feel about
traveling in airplanes and all that and
leaving my house period things are a lot
more calm for me in June so bear with me
guys bear with me I'm also losing my
voice again I was screaming a lot though
and that this is all because of how much
I was screaming so yeah I just wanted to
let you know why things have been a
little bit weird on my channel and yeah
just hang tight for the rest of maine's
it's gonna be a bumpy ride over here so
and I almost wasn't gonna post a video
tomorrow tomorrow's Wednesday well when
this video goes up it's Wednesday
because I literally got back from Vegas
today and landed a few hours ago but I
was like you know what I can film this
video it's very quick it's very simple
and at least I have something going up
for you guys and it's been so requested
for me to review this
for me to talk about it because I love
the physician's formula butter bomb but
butter bronzer so much it's hands-down
my favorite drugstore bronzer ever so
when this bad boy came out a lot of you
guys were asking for my opinion I
actually got this in the mail a couple
days before I left to Vegas and I had
been trying it out playing with the
products and I wanted to post the video
before I left but I didn't get around to
doing that so that is what I'm doing for
you guys today so Physicians Formula
came out with this butter collection
palette and I was so excited when I
opened my package when I saw that I got
this in the mail I was actually getting
so many DMS from you guys like did you
see Physicians Formula is coming out
with a butter palette and what is that
about so this is what the palette looks
like it is I'm gonna go into packaging
in a second but you get a butter bronzer
a butter blush and then two butter
highlights and you also get this is the
butter paradise at the toilet and out of
everything out of everything this is the
most exciting product for me hands down
I feel like this is something that has
been so requested from all of us for so
long like ever since their first butter
bronzed are released I know that since
the first time I got that was like man
this would be the most amazing perfume
for the summertime like taking this to
the beach and just spray off such an
amazing scent it honestly smells exactly
like the butter bronzer it's like
exactly you know what though is it the
scent isn't that strong in the palette
it is way stronger in the actual compact
so if you hate the scent you might like
this palette because it's not too too
strong but anyway back to this so this
is a tiny little perfume you only get
point five fluid ounces so I would I
would assume you would go through this
really quickly at least I would is so
tiny but I feel like it does have a very
powerful scent now it's not extremely
long-lasting this isn't flower bomb by
any means but I mean for 15 bucks you
get four face products and
a little cologne perfume thing I think
that is such a great value especially
since physician's formula tends to be
the more pricier brand at the drugstores
everything for them is just a little bit
more expensive so I was a little bit I
was pleasantly surprised by the price of
this so right off the jump I will say I
really like this palette I do enjoy it I
like every single product in here even
these highlights because when I first
looked at them I was like I don't know
if I'm gonna like them this is just way
too yellow golden for me and then this
was just way too sparkly for me by the
way this one came broken so all I had to
do was just like squish it in there and
it was back to normal they kind of have
that color pop super shock highlight
consistency not the blush of the bronzer
just the highlights so at first the
colors really threw me off but I found
that my favorite way to apply this is to
mix them both together and then apply it
to my cheeks because mixing them both
takes away like that strong yellow
undertone for this one but then it also
takes away that strong glittery pink
undertone and this one the mix is just
perfect for me I'm actually wearing both
of them mixed on my cheeks right now if
you don't like sparkle I would say lay
off this one I don't like sparkle but
make something about mixing both of them
makes it like sparkle in a delicious not
too much kind of way in this palette you
do get three limited edition products
you get the butter paradise perfume and
the two highlights these are two
never-before-seen shades they are
exclusive just to this palette so you're
not gonna be able to get them
individually and I'm actually pretty
sure this whole thing is limited edition
like I don't think this will be around
forever the bronzer and the blush are
two permanent colors they already have
so this is their bronzer in deep bronzer
and then this is their blush and vintage
rose and I love both of them a lot the
bronzer that I normally use just their
original shade called bronzer but I find
that deep bronzer is just a little bit
warmer and like more like suntan e and
summery so I love that one as well this
palette is for medium to deep skin tones
they have two on their website they have
light to medium and then they have
medium to deep but what I found really
interesting I'm clearly not
like my skin tone is not medium didn't
know it's say I'm like a light skin tone
yeah the company didn't send me like to
media they sent me medium to deep
probably because this isn't very medium
to deep this highlight right here I feel
like it would look a little strange on
deep skin tones and I don't exactly know
if this bronzer would even show up on
you if you have a deep skin tone like I
keep thinking about my best friend
Emilio's not even like super super deep
but she does have a deeper complexion
and I don't even think this bronzer what
bronzed her face I think she would need
something darker so I don't know dude I
feel like maybe they should have come
out with another palette they should
have named the other one fair delight
and they should have come out with like
a deep too dark or something like that
I definitely think if you have a medium
skin tone you can still rock this that I
like this is good for medium skin I just
don't know about that whole deep thing
you know I just ride on which the only
difference in the light kit by the way
is the bronzer and the blush because the
light kit still has the stain to
highlights and the perfume so anyway I
just wanted to mention that that was
like my only little grape but this
product my only little like mmm it was
the only thing I didn't like well
actually I don't like this packaging I
know that they needed something deep
enough to put their perfume in and stuff
but I think it's a little bulky it's
just like I don't know I'm not crazy
about this packaging but I knew that was
gonna happen because I've never been
crazy about Physicians Formula packaging
ever I feel like they are a bit bulky I
know their stuff is really pretty to
look at and the packaging is like nice
and stuff but it's like pokey
so yeah I would say those are the only
two things I don't like about this
palette the only two cons honestly
everything else is amazing of the
formula is so great if you don't know
about the butter formula it says that
this is infused with a powerful blend of
Muro Muro butter Kapow kuku butter I'm
probably saying that wrong but cocoa
butter and tokuma butter from the lush
and nutrient-rich Amazon and packed with
essential fatty acids and provitamin
that softened condition and moisturize
the skin leaving it silky soft and I
totally agree with that in the sense
that this doesn't look powdery on the
skin at all you can pile on all these
products and they just melt right
into the skin and I'm pretty much
wearing this entire palette on my face I
went in with the bronzer in deep bronzer
and I pretty much put that everywhere
and I used my equal tools precision
powder brush and just bronze up the skin
my face my neck and then for blush i
went in with vintage rose and I used my
Sonia Kashuk number 19 brush and I love
this blush it just gives you a nice
healthy flush to the skin and honestly
when swatching it doesn't look like
anything special this is one of those
blushes that you have to apply to your
face because watching it on the back of
your hand does absolutely nothing but on
the face it does give you a nice pretty
soft flush to the skin and then for my
highlight like I said I just mixed it
both of them together and I used my
color pop f10 brush and then I just set
my entire face with my morphe setting
spray to just melt everything in further
and I love it I love it and i love that
it's drugstore i can totally look past
the packaging because I do love the
formula of this whole butter butter line
I love their butter stuff I'm also
wearing the Physicians Formula a healthy
foundation right now by the way it's
become one of my favorite foundations
ever I don't like that it sinks into my
lines but it just makes my skin look so
smooth and it's so easy to blend into
the skin and the way I'm telling you
this but I am I just feel like I haven't
talked in so long like that's all I want
to do also before I brought the skin
though because this bronzer is a little
bit more warm I did go in with my
Catrice prime and fine contouring
palette in Ashley radiance and I did
contour just a little bit with this
before applying the bronzer like you can
see in the bronzer clip that I'm a
little bit contour already so I just
want to mention that also do you wanna
know what's on my eyes
I know I'm sorry I'm a chatterbox today
but I am wearing a LeMat cosmetics this
is the reina del Caribe volume 1 palette
which is amazing and beautiful look at
these look at this this is actually the
palette that one of my greatest friends
in the whole world Gaby I've spoken
about her a bunch of times on my channel
we went to high school together she's
one of my greatest greatest friends I
love her so pretty much is very very
close to my heart and she actually
released her own makeup line she is the
person who does my makeup for all the
kale polish photoshoots I came out with
her own makeup line it's called
on cosmetics and it's amazing because
alamat is where she's from in Cuba she
was born in Cuba and just this whole
brand means so much to me because not
only does it represent like my culture
as well but it's just so amazing to see
someone in my life and someone I love do
everything like from scratch pretty much
she is the owner of this brand she's
done everything she is the creation
behind everything and I'm just so so
proud of her and I've been loving this
palette like look at this deliciousness
I just used the matte shades today if
you love me I would love it if you guys
would go follow automatic asthmatics on
Instagram go tell Gaby I sent you she's
been really really nervous about this
whole launch and this whole line and it
would be nice if you guys can just you
know show her a little bit love I would
have loved I would love that
I would really love that but yeah guys
that completes this video those were my
thoughts on the butter collection

love it love it love it but I would also
love to know how you feel about this
palette
