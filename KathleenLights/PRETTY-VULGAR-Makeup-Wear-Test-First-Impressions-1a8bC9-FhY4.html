another try on first impressions type of
video and the brand we are going to be
trying out today is called pretty vulgar
I was recently telling you guys that I
bought a ton of things from this brand
and I asked you guys if you wanted to
see a full face first impressions and a
lot of you guys said yes so that is what
we are doing this brand really intrigued
me because the packaging on everything
is just really really cute a part of me
absolutely loves it and then another
part of me kind of doesn't I feel like
half of me loves really girly makeup
like this look at this this is a setting
spray it looks like a perfume bottle
that is so cute a part of me really
loves makeup like this and then the
other part of me likes really sleek
black packaging that's really really
simple it's like you know so I could
totally see why some people would think
that some of this packaging is a little
tacky but I find it kind of cute and
I've seen videos like this floating
around the internet because this is a
pretty brand new brand brand new brand
to Sephora but I have forced myself to
look away I haven't watched any video on
this brand because I want to make my own
opinion although I have read a ton of
reviews on the Sephora website that
doesn't really count so yeah everything
I will be putting on my face will be
pretty vulgar my name is strange too
like pretty vulgar
I don't know if I love that to be honest
anyway I'm having coffee right now this
is actually a colada but I'm not going
to drink this whole thing I promise not
even half I just didn't feel like
pouring them out into a little thing oh
I wanted to mention pretty vulgar does
have an eyebrow pencil but I guess I
didn't notice when I was buying all
these things that I completely forgot to
buy that I have my eyebrows building and
I didn't buy any of their eyeshadows I
know don't tell me they have a bunch of
eyeshadow palettes but I'm going to be
completely honest with you they didn't
call my attention there was something
about the packaging and I didn't want to
buy it if I wasn't going to use it as I
have too many family so today's video is
mainly like a first impressions on the
base but I will be testing out their
eyelash primer and their mascara so it's
kind of like eye products too in this
video
okay enough chatta chatta chatta you
already know the drill so it doesn't
really seem like pretty vulgar makes a
foundation primer so I'm just going to
use my dr. Brandt pores no more
Luminizer
I find that this is a good primer no
matter what foundation I'm putting on
because it's not too luminous but you
know it does a good job of like priming
the skin your foundation looks like this
actually really like this packaging it
looks like a squeezy too but it is a
pump
I actually prefer squeezy tubes sidenote
I know everyone loves pumps like things
I can squeeze and this is their blurring
Beauty mousse and according to the
Sephora website this is supposed to be
like an all-in-one type of thing it's
supposed to moisturize the skin prime
minister in and it says it's a
lightweight foundation that's just
supposed to even out your skin tone
it also says it's a face perfecting
blurring Beauty mousse that is
incredibly blendable and have light
weight coverage and it also has diamond
powder in it to enhance your skin's
radiance decrease the visibility of fine
lines and wrinkles and minimize the look
of pores Wow I purchased mine online and
I got the shade walking on eggshells
hopefully it matches me and honestly
when it comes to products like this that
are a bit moosie I don't like to use the
Beauty blenders or something about a
mosy consistency and my Beauty Blender
that kind of grosses me up so I'm just
going to pump all this dust take oh does
really take I'm scary this isn't
shooting out very well maybe I have to
hold it up like completely in this angle
that's the problem with these squeezy
tight tubes that have a pump like they
just never really work out and I'm gonna
take my it cosmetics love is a
foundation brush
oh that's movie I'm gonna doesn't feel
sick okay a little a hair too dark for
me but we'll make it work this does
blend in like extremely fast
that took absolutely no effort at all
but that only did like this side right
here I definitely have to apply more I'm
not a huge fan of this pump yeah you
definitely have to hold it like vertical
like this because if you try to pump it
out this way it doesn't pump out it's
just shocking how like fast this blends
like you put it on and then it just like
disappears but I don't know how I feel
about it like let me finish let me
finish I feel like at first I want to
slide it around but then I want to press
it in I'm getting me a little okay so
now that the foundation is completely on
my face pending one of those moments
where I don't know how I feel about it I
will quickly say I think it blends in
extremely fast this is like the easiest
thing to blend onto your skin and I
would say it has light to medium
coverage I think you can build it up I
will say though I don't know if it's
just because I have dry skin but this
has ever happened to you with moosie
products or foundations where it kind of
just looks like it's sitting on top of
your skin it doesn't look like the
foundation really sank into the skin it
kind of feels like it kind of looks like
it's just laying on top I don't notice
that too bad with this foundation there
are other moosie foundations I've tried
in the past that really do that to me I
think it looks pretty natural feel like
around here it looks like it's just
sitting on top of my skin and I feel
like it's just so easily removed like
look at this I don't know if you can
tell but that just wiped right off my
nose I think that might be the drawback
with this foundation I have a feeling
especially by the way it feels on my
skin but this might come off really
easily I don't know I don't know maybe
I'm misjudging it but anyway so far so
good it looks really nice on the skin it
looks really natural man may even have
an eyeliner pencil that I didn't good
what is wrong with okay so now let's
dive into some concealer this is the
under cover concealer and I picked mine
up in the shade little white line this
is supposed to be a lightly concealer
that has kind of like a gel serum
consistency
this smells identical identical to the
Urban Decay Naked concealer and I think
it also smells like the mac prolongwear
I haven't used a Mac Pro Longwear in
years I feel so I don't remember what
that smells like butt smells just like
their Urban Decay one and I put in too
much mm-hmm that's what it looks like
I'm going to take my little tart unicorn
brush thing I don't know the name of
that and I'm just going to blend that in
this dries fast that's already setting
let me blend that I think I like that I
do think it dries pretty quickly but if
you move quickly it works let me
highlight the rest of my face I would
say this concealer has really good
coverage I would call it full coverage
totally
alright so pretty well where it doesn't
have a setting powder so I'm just going
to use my Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish powder I'm
gonna use a little bit of that to set
underneath my eyes all right so I'm not
going to set the rest of my face because
this doesn't feel like it needs to be
set and I want to see how this
foundation does without setting it maybe
I should you know let me set my left
side I don't think there's going to make
much of a difference but let's just see
if it does for bronzer I'm going to be
using the bronze to be powder bronzer it
comes in as packaging it's really cute
because the bronzer is in this rose gold
packaging their blushes are in the same
packaging only it's like a classic gold
color and then their highlight is in
silver packaging so you look cute I like
that we have two Brown group and I
purchased the shade son of a bee I like
that and I'm going to take my ELF
pointed powder brush and I'm going to
bronze the skin with this metal I'm
always nervous to try the new bronzer
it's my favorite makeup item like it's
my favorite thing to try out which is
weird because how excited can one person
get about Brown I get excited I really
like the undertone in this because it is
a warmer bronzer like it's nice for the
summer if you have fair skin but it's
not orange so I like it I like the color
at least
and it does seem to be blending really
nicely this is the site I set my face so
it always blends master on top of
foundation that's been set this bronzer
is really pigmented I really like the
color I think it really gave my skin a
nice tanned look while still at the same
time it contoured my face so I think
that really liked this okay for blush I
purchased two colors and they're
actually pretty similar now that I look
at them side by side one is just a
little bit more peach these are the make
them blush powder blushes I think I'm
going to go with the peak ear color you
guys you knew that was going to happen
this is in the shade sweet revenge and
I'm going to take my morphe m-46 to
brush it's just like a round stippling
brush and I'm going to pop these on
mixology alright so I definitely think
it applies blush nicer on this side
where I set down this foundation so even
though it didn't feel like it needed to
be set I still think you should set this
with a little bit of powder besides that
I really like this blush color I think
it would be really nice for summer
especially if you have kind of like a
golden tan to you this will look so
beautiful on your cheeks it's matte but
it's not chalky or anything and it
almost feels like it has a subtle
barely-there glow alright I'm not going
to lie I have been waiting to put this
on my face this is their shimmering Swan
highlighter the name is funny and this
is in the shade glimmers of BS and it's
described as a pink champagne highlight
I haven't been to saw my face yet but
i've swatched this and the swatches are
so beautiful I'm going to use probably
my favorite highlighting brush ever this
is these away of a 134 brush and you
already know
oh my god that is beautiful sure I have
a hundred highlights that look like this
already but that's okay
this is extremely reflective so
definitely keep that in mind if you're
someone who prefers a subtle highlight
this is not for you okay so now let's
try out these guys I'm not going to lie
when I pulled these products out they
look a little goopy and a little thick
but I have high hopes let's see I'm
going to take the down below lash primer
in the shade Blackbird and this eyelash
primer is a little bit different because
it is a black color and I usually like
the black ones I don't really love white
eyelash primers the wand is really weird
it's kind of like a paddle
it has thicker more spread-out spikes at
the top and then thinner ones at the
bottom so let's see how it is going I
think I'm going to use the skinnier side
oh my god I don't like just I don't like
this let me use the thicker side okay
this is getting really clumpy for an
eyelash primer and it have great reviews
on the Sephora website so ah oh my gosh
what what do you think I don't know
about this oh there is so much product
on this wand right now I'm going to take
my morphe b71
thingy and I'm going to comb out these
terrible clumps that that lash primer
gave me when you brush it out it
actually looks good okay so now let's
take the mascara it looks just like the
primer only with the rose gold this is
called the feathers mascara and it's in
the shade of the raisin and even this
one comes out with a lot of product look
at it like there is a lot of product on
that wand I'm going to take a lot of
that off I don't want to make the same
mistake I made with the primer wish me
look like that primer already dried so
Network sorry if my camera was going
down this tripod is still messed up and
my new tripod has not come into mail yet
Oh forgive me I think that primer dries
really fast you're going to have to
multiply mascara really quickly after
you apply that primer because now that
the primer has dried it's making the
mascara look kind of dry and clumpy and
I definitely should have applied mascara
immediately
probably best to do one eye at a time
man I feel like I can't judge this
mascara correctly because of the primer
look okay so I really like how my lashes
look but they do look a little spidery
let me try to fix that I feel like this
combo gave me really dramatic lashes but
I definitely needed to comb through them
if I didn't do that they would have been
a hot mess I'm going to have to work
with that primer a little bit more see
if I could take some products off before
going in with that but it did give me
some drama that's for sure okay so let's
finish off this extremely simple look
everyday glam with a lip color
now I purchased three different lip
products from this brand we have the my
lips are sealed liquid lipsticks which
they are like traditional liquid
lipsticks that were used to these are
more of like a metallic liquefied
lipstick it doesn't dry down it has that
foiled metallic finish and I thought it
was going to be like a metallic liquid
lipstick that dries down but after
swatching it these don't seem to dry
down so I don't think I want to put this
one on I think I'm going to do this
little combo right here this is the
burry them with a smile matte lipstick
that's a weird name but I really love
this packaging it reminds me of old
school like makeup from the 20s I don't
know it just looks vintage to me and I
really like it so this is in the shade
green and propa and it's their nude
really really pretty let's dive right in
okay so I really like that
usually when lipsticks are matched
because we are so used to the liquid
lipsticks now a matte lipstick doesn't
really look matter than really feel
matte they're more of like a hydrating
kind of matte but this is actually met
but it feels really really comfortable
it didn't tug at my lips and they don't
feel drying at all and just for poops
and giggles I'm going to throw this on
this is the poisonous pout plumping lip
gloss and this is in the shade pick your
poison I'm just going to pop this on top
even though I don't want to I much
prefer this matte look but let's just
see if it plumps this doesn't really
have that much pigmentation to it it's
more of a sheer lip gloss I mean no it
looks pretty pigmented on my hand I'm
going to give it a couple of seconds to
see if it starts to tingle I mean it
said it's a plump look started to do
something
it says infused with a natural peptide
complex that it's supposed to make your
lips appear firmer smoother and fuller
and yeah that really completes this look
guys I have gotten so many requests in
the comment section to do a check in at
the end of the day so you can see how
this wears throughout the day every time
I post one of these first impressions I
always get comments like that so I
thought I would do that for this video
it's currently really late right now
it's 2 p.m. I like really late but I
started something that's really late and
I'm just going to keep this makeup on
and then I will come back to you guys at
the very end of the day right before I'm
going to take everything off and we're
going to talk about how at war let's see
let's see how it looks at the end of the
day but you know what I'm going to take
this gloss off and I want to test out
just a lipstick alone because I just I
really like this lipstick and I want to
test how long it wears and I really have
to be in the mood to wear gloss all
right so I'm just going to leave this on
my face I will come back to you guys at
the end of the night and I will give you
my final thought oh no I just wait I'm
sure a lot of you guys are like no wait
the setting spray I heard you guys I
heard you I felt you I thought you
screaming at me I forgot to try out the
setting spray and this is what I was
most excited about I want to apply this
to my face in a way where I can really
test it out but that's pretty difficult
because we don't know if the foundation
just lasted or if it's this so I'm just
going to spray half of my face and I'm
going to the side where I didn't set my
foundation I'm going to do this side wow
that just shot up my face I don't like
the spray on this that is going to leave
little drip marks for sure the trick to
setting sprays like this is to just
spray up and just let it fall on your
face because the mist is definitely not
fine enough to spray from right here
some setting sprays are really fine so
you can do that that close but not this
one now I will come back at the end of
the night and give you my final stuff
hey guys so I just woke up from a nap I
didn't really sleep much last night and
I just laid down for a second to read a
book and the next thing you know it's
freaking 9 p.m. so I had to come over
here and give you guys my final thought
okay so looking up close you know I
think it wore pretty nicely it lasted a
decent amount of time I mean it's been
on my face for like 7 hours and I could
still see the highlight on both sides
this is the side where I set with powder
and this is the side where I just set
what they're setting spray but to be
honest I can't really tell the
difference so I don't think the setting
spray really did much if I'm going to be
honest it does look a little cakey or on
my nose not going to lie it also really
faded on my chin by the way it is a la
nation that's kind of easy to remove I
scratched my face here earlier you kind
of see like the line but we find that I
kind of like it I also kind of like this
last primer mascara combo it's
definitely extremely clumpy but I really
like the effect it gave me so I'm going
to play around with that a little bit
more and the lip I really liked as well
but it faded pretty fast the thing with
this lipstick is it is matte but it's
not the kind of matte that sets and
dries it's a little bit more of a
hydrating matte so it was just kind of
like sitting on top of the lip and never
have to dry so it faded about three
hours
I ain't dinner and all that stuff and I
was gone but I left at about 3 hours
which you know I can deal with that I
could reapply no problem but yeah yeah
okay that was my final check-in I my
hair looks crazy I'm going to take a
shower and then go to bed I hope you
found this video helpful doctor puts

watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye
