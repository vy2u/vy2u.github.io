a first impression sesh demo slash
review slash wear test follow me around
something whatever um let me address
something really quick well number one
if you hear that really annoying sound
it's the AC vent the AC vent in this
house has a lot of sound also if you
hear a loud screech it's a dog a lot of
you guys know that I'm in the process of
moving and we're staying at Danny's
dad's house um I couldn't film in the
little corner that I always film in
because I needed the little table that's
always behind me I needed to use it it's
like right in front of me over here I
needed to use it and it was just like a
big mess so I had to film like smack-dab
in the living room and I didn't want to
film in a living room and then show you
like everyone's furniture and stuff
since this isn't my house I didn't want
to like just have like a random living
room in my background so I just threw
this up really quick I know the lighting
is off this is like wrinkly look at
these wrinkles like it's not cute I know
that everybody has like a sequin
backdrop these days but this is
specifically only in the meantime if I'm
doing a makeup tutorial or something
where I need to put makeup on my face
regular talking videos will be in my
little corner until I'm able to move
into my new house okay longest intro
ever so like three months ago I hauled
this product this is the Nivea men
sensitive post shave bone and in that
video I asked you guys if you wanted to
see a first impressions of me testing
this product out because everyone says
it works as a primer actually I've only
heard nikkietutorials talk about this
but she says that this is like an
amazing face primer so I hold it I hold
it a while ago and I asked you guys if
you wanted to see like a wear test I was
going to put it on half of my face and
then put like a regular normal primer on
the other half and see how this compares
to like an actual primer and I had the
idea to film that video like three
months ago and now is when I'm getting
around to doing it it has been requested
every single day since I posted that
haul like every day at least two people
asked me like hey where's that Nivea
bomb video you said you were gonna post
and I'm like
you're right so better late than never
right so let's go ahead and try this out
I hope I mean this says it's made for
sensitive skin so I hope I'm good
it comes in like a really nice glass
bottle I mean it says Nivea men so it's
a little weird but it's a huge size this
has 3.3 fluid ounces and this was like
$5 it's crazy if this really does a
great job of making your makeup last all
day it's like a $5 primer the majority
of my primers are like in storage
they're not in storage like melting in a
storage a lot of you guys are asking me
that I have them all here but like
they're all in boxes in a room in like a
nice cold room so all my makeup doesn't
melt and there's just so many boxes that
I can't go through all of them so the
only primer that I really had out for me
to use on the other side of my face was
the makeup forever smoothing primer
because I love this with my makeup
forever face and body it's like the
perfect combination so this is the one
that I've been using recently with that
foundation so this is the primer I'm
going to use on the other side of my
face it's a very expensive primer this
is like a $35 primer so I think it's
cool that we're gonna put it to the test
I'm gonna put on my little Tings right
here these aren't the ones that I always
wear the ones that you guys always see
me wearing those are in storage okay so
I'm gonna put the makeup rubber primer
on this side of my face oh I don't know
why I rubbed between my fingers
because I'm not putting it on my entire
face
okay so on this side of my face I'm
going to use the Nivea men sensitive
post shave balm so I've been awesome if
you had a pump but it does not so am I
supposed to shake this I'm going to put
on the back of my hand so you can see it
is just pretty much like a milky
consistency it smells like a manly soap
for those of you wondering the scent
like I'm rubbing like an aftershave like
a Mac's ax aftershave
okay so have the Nivea post shave balm
on this side it gives a little bit of a
glow and it kind of has like a tacky
feeling to it which will probably help
the foundation adhere to it so that's
probably a good thing this side is it's
obviously like completely matte it's the
smoothing primer so yes the foundation
I'm going to be wearing today is the ex1
and visit wear liquid foundation I'm in
the shade f-100 hopefully I'm a little
bit more fair these days but let's try
to make this work I'm using my Real
Techniques complexion perfection
okay so now I have my foundation on and
both sides look pretty much exactly the
same only this side seems to have a
little bit more of a glow I don't know
if you could tell I don't know if that's
how it's going to be throughout the
entire day because I heard a lot of
people say that this really controls
your oil that the Nivea primer is really
good at oil control so I don't know why
mine looks a little bit like glowy or on
this side but that is the only thing I
noticed at first and also my pores on
this side are much less visible again I
did use a pore minimizing primer this
doesn't really minimize your pores I
mean it did help a little bit and
minimize them just a touch but this side
my pores are less visible so yeah I'm
going to go ahead and finish the rest or
something in my eye is driving me crazy
I'm gonna go ahead and finish the rest
of my makeup and then I will be right
back okay so I just finished my makeup
I'm just going to like the mall today
and hanging out so I didn't want to go
like full-on like prom makeup so my
makeup applied the same on both sides I
didn't have a problem with either one of
these products look like with the way
that my makeup applied so I kind of took
inspiration from Tati from glam life
guru for this video I kind of want to
make it like a follow me around style
kind of thing not really but I will have
like random check-ins throughout the day
to let you guys know how the foundation
on this side is lasting you know to see
and then I will have like my final
check-in at the end of the day and tell
you guys like an overview like what my
actual first impression is right now it
is 9 o'clock a.m. of course you knew
that already so yeah I will check back
in in a few hours
hey guys so I'm doing my first chicken
it is not 2 o'clock maybe I should have
checked in earlier because it's been
like 5 hours since I did my makeup and I
haven't even gone to the mall today I'm
supposed to be going to the mall but I
don't think I'm going I think I'm gonna
end up going tomorrow I'm trying to find
good lighting I came to my mom's house
and I have no idea where the lighting is
good
I don't know I hope you can see here but
okay so I'm looking at myself in like
the little viewfinder thing this is a
sign of my face that I applied the
makeup forever
step one equalizer in smoothing this is
the makeup ever primer and then this
side is the Nivea shave balm and I'm not
sure if you guys can tell but my bronzer
has started to fade it's been five hours
but it has started to fade on the makeup
forever side and it hasn't faded at all
and on the Nivea side which is pretty
impressive they're both still on but
this one is getting a little bit splotch
here because it's fading now I'm not
exactly sure if it's because I was like
leaning on something maybe while I was
watching a video like I was resting my
head on this side and not this side I
think so far so good I think it is
actually keeping my makeup in place this
is my face up close see how it's looking
faded on this side but not really on
this side hmm
the cinavia thing could be actually a
really good primer okay so that is like
my 5 hour check in I will check in in a
couple of hours maybe 2 to 3 hours from
now and let you guys know so it is now
507 5 o'clock and I have had this
situation on my face for about 8 hours
and that's usually like people like
someone's typical day like when they
wear makeup is around 8 hours and I
think 8 hours is a good wear test time I
think I am going to go ahead and end
this video here just because it's a it's
really hard for me to film at nighttime
where we're currently staying because
everybody is already home from work and
the house is like really chaotic so I
can't film at nighttime and right now
this is the only some that I have since
it's about to be dark here in a little
bit but I am so incredibly impressed
with this Nivea shaped bomb thing I feel
like I'm really going to be using this
as my primer from now on while switching
it up with my other primers of course
but I really love it this is let me get
you closer this is the side that I have
the makeup forever primer and you can
still see my bronzer but it does look a
little bit splotchy like I said earlier
and
side is perfectly still bronzed I feel
like for the sake of this video I should
have maybe applied a lot more makeup to
see because all I did today was apply
bronzer and highlight but you could
still kind of see my highlight on this
side oh you can still see my highlight
okay okay a little bit but while I was
just inside right now I told Danny which
side I didn't tell him which side was
the Nivea side but I was like which side
looks better and he was like this side
definitely and I was like this is a five
dollar product well this is like thirty
overall my first impression and my final
thought is that this product is actually
an amazing primer I'm gonna keep using
it and it's for sensitive skin so
hopefully it doesn't break me out or
clog my pores or irritate my skin I
really really like it I'm gonna try it
out again tomorrow using like heavier
makeup and I might update you guys in my
favorites video later on this month
there's like something in the bottom of
my mom's pool what is that what are
those Oh a bug okay so I'm ready to get
on and head out on my mom's house and
just do nothing for the rest of they
probably watch them Breaking Bad where
I'm currently watching that show it's
pretty good so that completes this video
I really love this product leave me your
thoughts on this product down below let
me know if you like these kinds of
videos I know that this one was all over
the place because I'm not home my last
check-in would have been like at my desk
but you know I'm not there so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please subscribe
