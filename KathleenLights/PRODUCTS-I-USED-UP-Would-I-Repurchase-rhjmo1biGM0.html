an empties video I haven't done one of
these videos in so long I'm actually
pretty shocked I'm pretty shocked and I
didn't realize how long it had been
until I looked into this bag and it was
literally overflowing like I had
products coming out so I had to like
split this up and I got a bunch of
products from this bag because if not we
would be here for a million years if you
don't know if you are new here I like to
do these videos every so often I keep
this bag in my bathroom and every time I
finish a product whether that's like a
hair product a skincare product the
makeup product I will throw it in here
when I have a great amount of product I
like to sit here and tell you guys if I
would repurchase the product or not if
it was good or not because usually when
you use something up you kind of know if
you like it or not so I'm just gonna
give you like my little mini reviews as
usual and let me know if you like these
types of videos you know what I never
say this but give the video a thumbs up
and I'll know to keep doing them because
I don't know if these videos are already
like old to old school YouTube you know
like has anybody even doing these videos
anymore that's okay because over here we
are but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and get
started there are a lot of products in
here that you've already seen when it
comes to these videos I go through a lot
of the same things like I have a
Bioderma in here I go through this like
water micellar water this is my favorite
I find that this is the only micellar
water that I've used that doesn't burn
my eyes I have tried so many that just
sting the absolute crap out of my eyes
and this one doesn't do that yet it gets
off every trace of makeup I'm obsessed
with Bioderma it's amazing and I ply
mine at Beauty lish I buy them in bulk I
get like five at a time okay so I
actually have a couple perfumes I went
through a couple smaller perfumes this
one is blossom by Jimmy Choo I actually
still have a little bit left but for
some reason let me try to spray it okay
now it's gonna do it of course this
always happens to me in these empties
videos but this was actually a limited
edition fragrance from Jimmy Choo and
I'm so sad it was limited edition
because this was one of my favorite
perfumes especially when I got it I was
using it non-stop but then I kind of
stopped using it when I heard it was
limited edition and I only used it every
once in a while it's a very sweet scent
but it's a little bit fruity as well it
kind of has like that sweet fruitiness
but it also has a little bit
that musky scent like it's sweet but
it's not too sweet it's a sexy sweet and
I loved it it also has sandalwood in it
which I love I love sandalwood but I
found that this didn't really last on my
skin like I would apply it and then
after a few hours I really wouldn't
smell it people really wouldn't smell it
on me but I always kept it in my purse
and I just reapply it because I bought
the small bottle and it just smelled so
good I just wish it lasted longer so if
this was still available I think I would
still repurchase it just in the small
bottle so that I'm able to reapply
throughout the day because it's not very
long wearing I hope they come back with
it or something similar cuz it just
smells so good actually purchased this
while I was at the mall with Allison
Henry she's a youtuber I was at the mall
with her and she like walked out of
Sephora and I was like mmm you smell
really good what is that and she was
like oh my god I just sprayed Jimmy to
blossom and then I ran in and purchased
it but anyway I went through a morphe
prep and set makeup setting spray I've
gone through like two of these already
or two or three I don't know why there's
only one bottle and oh I have to empty
Morphy bottles this is hands-down my
favorite setting spray of all time I
just loved nothing left but I just love
the continuous mist you never get those
water droplets all over your face the
mist is what sells me on this product it
just applies so beautifully but this
also leaves your skin nice and plump and
hydrate it I think it's a great setting
spray it really just some melts all the
products into your skin and it takes
away that cakey look you just look nice
and fresh but it's not too dewy it's not
like talk Chelle luminous dewy skin mist
it's kind of just like a makeup fixer it
is so so good I highly recommend it this
is my favorite morphe product of all
time it smells so good right now you
know that every time I think of that
blossom Jimmy Choo perfume immediately
the Powerpuff Girls song comes in my
head listen bubbles buttercup and she's
a toughie spider a powder puff see their
day another setting spray I went through
is the Milani make it last setting spray
now when it comes to the drugstore this
one is actually my favorite setting
spray at the drugstore especially if you
want your makeup to last all day I feel
like
really does prolong your makeup it says
16 hour wear I think that's a little
dramatic but it does provide your makeup
and it kind of leaves your makeup
looking perfect for some reason every
time I spray this all over my face I'm
like wow it just made my makeup look ten
times better and not in the way that
this does this is kind of like a fresh
dewy plumping effect this is just like I
look flawless I don't know how to
explain it it makes my makeup look
awesome but the second ingredient is
alcohol so I know a lot of people don't
like it for everyday I don't use this
one everyday but whenever I'm glammed
out this is one of my favorite setting
sprays to use it is amazing okay so I
went through this hand wash and I kind
of wanted to start including other types
of products not just like haircare and
makeup and stuff so I went through a
bath and Bodyworks exfoliating hand soap
this is when they came out with these
really cute hand soaps around the
holidays and this is toasted vanilla
chai oh my gosh I have one in my Beauty
room bathroom and then I have another
one still completely full because I felt
in love with this scent it smells so
good and every time somebody washes
their hands at my house they would tell
me like wow that hand soap is amazing so
I hope they come back with the scent
because it is to die for it smells like
Christmas morning it's so good and this
one actually happens to have tea tree
oil in it which is nice and I really
liked it exfoliated my hands and made
them nice and clean and I would totally
repurchase that it's just not available
anymore let's discuss how many we've
gone through five koushin gel cleansing
spa water thingies I like to buy these
these are the travel ones they do have a
pack that's bigger but I like to get the
travel ones because I like traveling
with these and they're just easier to
take on the go these are my favorites
face wipes to take off my makeup the
only thing is that they are pricey
they're cozy though but they're really
really good I do use a bunch of
different brands I get some at the
drugstore I get some at Sephora but
these are hands-down my absolute
favorites but you guys know that have
you've seen these videos oh look I put
my seller makeup removing wipe these are
always in these types of videos as well
because these are my favorite at the
drugstore they take off all my makeup
but they're the micellar ones so they
don't sting they don't strip the skin
they are
amazing and the Koshien don't ones are
also really good they don't strip the
skin and they're very very wet which I
like in my face wipes but I don't like
the soapy greasy ones like the
Neutrogena ones man I really really
dislike the Neutrogena face wipes but
those I finished up these and these I
did not like at all these are from the
brand well this one wasn't too bad these
are the I believe the brand is called
too-cool-for-school
and these are the tackles out wipe and
the cleansing wipes I got these at
Sephora but when I went to go search
them up I could not find them so I don't
even know if these are still being sold
at Sephora these are more skincare than
the other ones it's supposed to have
like awesome ingredients but I just
found them to be very very very sticky
and when I would wipe off my makeup my
face just felt like it had this weird
film over it actually yeah I did not
like these at all not that I'm
remembering I really did not like these
so I just kind of use these to wipe off
like arm swatches and stuff not my
favorite and I feel the exact same way
about these actually dislike these a
little bit more these are the facial
cleansing towelettes from Burt's Bees I
felt like they were almost dry like they
had no moistness to them awful like just
awful and I've noticed that I don't
really like the scent of Burt's Bees
face wipes those are not as bad as those
other ones that I really don't like but
they weren't the best smelling so yeah I
finished those up but I would not
repurchase those or the other ones I
went through to Joe Malone fragrances
they're both nectarine blossom and honey
I love the scent I love this scent so
much I don't know what they're both the
same I don't know I just smell looking I
get these little bottles so I can travel
with them and so that I can keep them in
my purse and also I don't find Jo Malone
perfumes to last that long on my skin I
know everybody's different and I know so
many people who swear by Jo Malone
cologne but on me this scent doesn't
really last that long I mean it lasts
longer than my Jimmy to blossom but I
have others that last a bit longer than
this but I keep it purchasing it because
this smells so good it has a little bit
of honey a little bit of peach it just
smells so welcoming and I think it's
perfect for spring it's so so good a
very warm and cozy scent
my other favorite is blackberry in bay I
think I like blackberry in May just a
little bit more than this one but those
two are my top two Jo Malone fragrances
I've tried a bunch and those two are my
favorites so I will definitely be
repurchasing these they are so cool I
went through a Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara this is one of my favorite
mascaras but I haven't repurchased it
because right now I am loving my thrive
cosmetics one this one is cheaper but
the Thrive one is just so easy to remove
I'm like loving that mascara right now
but when it comes to an affordable
mascara this is actually one of my
favorites you know what I had definitely
need to go online and purchase another
one because I was obsessed this was like
hands down the best mascara I had ever
used at one point so I need to
repurchase it like I'm gonna do that
today actually but I love this this
gives you so much volume like incredible
amount of volume I love this mascara
it's one of the best for sure I went
through two eyebrow pencils and these
are my old colors this is the Dior brows
Tyler and I have the shade Universal
Brown and now it's just a little bit too
light for my brows but when my hair was
lighter
I used this all the time and even though
it's Dior and it's very very expensive I
really really like this I found it super
comparable to this anasazi one and
lasted all day on my brows and I really
really liked it I just have a
repurchased it because I mean the
Anastasio one works just as good that
one's really really really good but this
is a little bit cheaper and it and it's
amazing so this is the Anastasia brow
Wiz but this is in the shade soft Brown
and I don't use soft brown anymore I use
dark brown because my hair is a little
bit darker these days but I love it it's
amazing
and then another Anastasio product
actually went through is this waterproof
gel liner in the shade dark side I have
no more dark side I love this eyeliner
it's very very black it's one of those
that you can twist up so you don't have
to sharpen it and it's very very creamy
so it just glides on the waterline like
I said it's super super black so I love
this so much I rarely go through a whole
black eyeliner but this one is one of my
favorites I went through a drunk
elephant TLC friend boosts glycolic
night serum this is one of my favorite
products at night
I use this about three times a week it's
a nice serum but it has 12% H a blend
horse chestnut raspberry extract and
cactus enzyme I don't know what all
that's supposed to do but I know the aah
a kind of works as a chemical exfoliator
and I find that this really does improve
my skin whenever I use this I notice a
difference it just makes my skin look
almost bright less dull just overall
nice and smooth it's a great great serum
and even though that's expensive like
that suspense to me personally i 100%
rather invest in my skincare and in my
makeup like I rather have drugstore
makeup over high-end makeup if it means
I'm gonna have high-end skincare instead
does that make sense I don't know I find
that when it comes to makeup drugstore
is 100 percent comparable to high-end
but you don't always get the best
skincare at the drugstore even though my
face wash is from Target and is like 10
bucks and it's the best face wash ever
but I haven't had the best look with
like serums and stuff like that so I
love this and I definitely think it's
worth the money and I'm already
repurchased it so I went to another Brio
Gio don't despair repair deep
conditioning mask I go through these
like water because I don't use
conditioner I only use hair masks as my
conditioner because I only wash my hair
like twice a week I lather up my ends in
this and then I put my hair in like a
shower cap and then I'll just wash the
rest of my body do other stuff while
this is sitting in my hair and then when
I rinse it out my hair feels amazing
this is one of the best if not the best
hair masks I've ever used ever oh my
gosh this has been sitting in this bag
for a long time this is the Laurie OH
brow stylist plumper this was a brow gel
that I was obsessed with for a really
long time and then I kind of stopped
using it this is the shade light to
medium and I feel like I need a shade a
little bit darker than this cuz this is
very golden for my brows right now but I
loved this this was one of my favorite
brow products ever it leaves like fibers
on your brows which makes them look a
little bit more full it really plumps
the brows and it just leaves them
looking like that all day I really
enjoyed this you know what I'm gonna
purchase another one
this video has made me think about
things I used to love I need another
Kiko mascara and I need another
Maybelline brow stylist plumper it's so
so good I love it and then the last
product is this I went through a body
mist this is the Alba thing Reyes
Colonia that your mama used to spray on
you when you were done taking a bath at
least in my Hispanic culture or at least
the Hispanic Miami culture you grew up
on this this one and the purple one the
purple one is like way more violet like
you get more of that Violetta sent this
one in the Royal violets one the golden
one this one is so much better this is
literally like the best I forget where
they sell this my grandmother is the one
who gets this for me but I like to spray
this on everything after I'm done taking
a shower I'll spray a little bit on my
body or I'll spray some on the bed on my
pillows like it just takes me back to my
childhood and it just smells amazing
this is literally a baby this is what
babies smell like oh my god well this
takes me right back to 1996 I love that
and I will repurchase I just haven't yet
but I will
