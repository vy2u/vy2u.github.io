on this look right here it's using the
Jacqueline Hill favorites palette a
tutorial using this palette has been
requested since I reviewed it and during
the move I lost it I lost this and like
five other pallets had a little bit of a
meltdown thought they were gone for good
and I finally found this in a box of
stuff that I had not opened yet which is
weird because I don't remember petrol
makeup in that box but anyway obviously
this isn't a very like natural like
makeup look I thought it would be fun to
play around with some glitter like on
the lash line and just to use like
Pink's on the lid I used mainly like
these colors right here and this really
pretty coral so yes this is the look I
came up with I'm French now hope you
enjoyed this video and I don't know why
I'm wearing this shirt this shirt
totally doesn't go with this look but
honestly didn't know what I was doing I
was it was just a shirt I was wearing
hashtag lazy if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep on watching
ok so I've already primed my lids and
now I'm taking this color right here in
the palette and I'm applying this color
into my crease as my transition shade
now all of these colors have like
individual numbering but it doesn't show
up on the actual palette so I will leave
a list down below of the shades I use
and like the numbers that correspond to
each shadow I will leave it all in the
description box so now I'm taking this
really pretty pinky cranberry shade and
on a flat shader brush I'm applying this
to my entire lid
I'm grabbing my fix+ and I'm spraying my
brush dipping it back into that
eyeshadow and plopping it right back
onto my eyelid to just intensify that
color even more now I'm going to take
this really beautiful coral shade and
I'm going to apply this into my crease
with a little fluffy brush I actually
got this brush in my Ipsy bag that video
will go up after this video sorry to
taking me so long to post it but yeah
it's a really nice little blending brush
and I'm just applying that everywhere in
my crease I'm taking these two shades
one is a more pinky champagne and the
other one is more gold and I'm using
that to highlight my brow bone and then
this shade right here take a really
pretty pink iridescent I don't know it's
beautiful and on my flat shader brush
I'm just popping that right into the
center of the lid just so that like it
looks like the light catches the center
of the eyeball if that makes sense so
okay really quickly I'm going to do my
face okay this is the hourglass primer
serum and this has changed the game for
me I want you guys to see how this makes
my skin look I do not recommend this for
anybody except super super super dry
skin because it's pretty much like an
oil for your face but matte foundation
lies beautifully on top of it for me I
couldn't use like matte foundation so
much before but it's amazing as you can
tell by my face I really love it so on
top of that I'm using it the Maybelline
fit me foundation in 1:20 and I'm just
dotting that on my entire face of course
Danny has to you know interrupt he works
all day in the Sun so he's like a
different color
so I'm blending that into my skin with
my makeup oh excuse me with my makeup
geek stippling brush like foundation
stippling brush I love this is the best
brush for foundation and I'm just
buffing that right into the skin I'm
using it the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer this is in like no this isn't
fair neutral I keep forgetting the name
but it's in fair neutral and I'm
applying that underneath my eyes and
just highlighting the rest of my face
honestly I can't like I can't use any
other concealer recently because this
concealer is the best out there I'm also
going to use that concealer to like
sharpen the eyeshadow a bit and yeah I
just blend it in you guys have seen me
do that a million times so I just skip
that but I'm taking this yellowy powder
in the NYX contour kit and I'm using
that to set my under eye concealer it's
kind of like their banana shade that's
what it's called so yes this is an elf
brush I used to set it I'm taking this
mister right now eyeliner by the balm
I'll leave the shade name below but it's
a really pretty grey and I just put that
on my waterline and my tight line as
well then I'm taking this beautiful
matte purple and I am putting this on my
lower lash line with a pencil brush it's
such a pretty purple I love it then I'm
just going to drag that purple okay it's
gonna be hard to explain but you can see
what I'm doing I'm just dragging the
line upward so it can match like the top
of my eyelid you know I'm saying yeah
back into this cool shade with that same
pencil brush I'm just blending that
purple out a little bit so that all the
colors can like flow together and match
to highlight my inner corners I'm just
using the same two shades I use to
highlight my brow bone
now I'm taking this lit cosmetics
glitter it's amazing and the lip
cosmetics adhesive and here I'm showing
you the glitter helping hoping it
doesn't fall everywhere but it's such a
pretty red with like a bunch of pink
little I don't know it's really
beautiful this is a tart brush not
exactly sure the name but it's like
their eyeliner brush and I'm just
applying this really really close to my
upper lash line just like if it was
liquid liner you know like a typical
black liquid liner I'm doing that just
with glitter instead and I really like
how it turned out it's just a little
touch you can only tell when your eyes
are closed but it's really pretty I like
it so I'm packing on the mascara to my
top and lower lashes as well this is the
clinic bottom lash and then I'm applying
some demi wispies to my eyelashes and
that completes the eyes so moving on to
the rest of the face I'm taking the
cooler toned contour powder in the NYX
contour kit and I'm using this to just
hollow out my cheekbones and to contour
you know because it's contour kit
and then to just warm up my skin just a
little I'm taking the Physicians Formula
bronze booster bronzer with my Sigma duo
fiber brush almost forgot the name and
I'm just adding a little bit of warmth
to the face for blush I'm using the NYX
blush in the shade mauve it looks so
pretty like with any look and since the
eyes are so like BAM and colourful I
want it to go pretty light on the blush
and for the highlight I'm using one by
NARS it's it's a blush but it is not a
blush it's called reckless and at first
I didn't like this because it has a
little bit of glitter in it but it is
really really pretty what's applied to
the cheeks I don't know for some reason
it's not showing up on camera but it's
pretty intense and I like it and I'm
using a real techniques eyes shadow
brush so to finish up the look I'm using
the Fergie daily lipstick by Wet n Wild
and then that completes this makeup look
