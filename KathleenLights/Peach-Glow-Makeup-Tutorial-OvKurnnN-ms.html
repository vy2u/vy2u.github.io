tutorial on this look right here it's
very light fresh and dewy this look is
perfect for those of you who don't like
to wear heavy makeup like a full face of
really thick or heavy makeup I'm excited
because this video is sponsored by
Smashbox so I will be showing you how I
use their camera-ready
BB water that I have been using for a
few weeks and loving so I'll be showing
you how I use this and you could
actually win this product by visiting a
Smashbox BB water calm all the info will
be below by the way so yes check that
out and if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep on watching so
I'm going to start with my face makeup
first I'm going to be taking the
Smashbox BB water in the shade light and
applying this to my face I'm not going
to be using a primer because this
already has priming benefits in this it
has a very sheer breathable coverage but
it does do a good job of evening out my
skin tone and blurring my pores as you
can see it does have a runny texture so
BB water is the perfect name because it
honestly feels like you are applying
water to your skin it's pretty amazing I
really like that it has a good amount of
SPF it is SPF 30 which is great to wear
during the day so it can protect your
skin the best part about this is that
it's oil and alcohol-free so it's
perfect for sensitive skin like myself
this makes my skin feel so incredibly
hydrated as well I have been using a
non-stop and I really really love it so
I'm just blending that into my skin now
I'm going to move on to concealer and
here I am using the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 15 fair I'm just
applying that underneath of my eyes
because it has a nice fresh dewy finish
so it's perfect with this look and then
I'm just going to be blending that in
I'm also applying that on other parts of
my face to highlight and also blending
that in
I'm going to set the places where I
applied the concealer and I'm using this
NYX HD powder in the shade banana this
is going to help prevent it from
creasing underneath the eyes and just to
make everything set nicely next I'm
going to move on to bronzing up the skin
I'm not going to contour or just want a
nice warm complexion and I am using the
Physicians Formula bronze booster in the
shade medium
then I'm going to go in with blush and
the blush I'm using today is the makeup
geek blush in the shade romance it's a
nice soft pink but it does have a gold
sheen to it it is really pretty it is a
beautiful glow to the skin and now I'm
going to highlight my cheeks using the
colour-pop
super shock cheek highlight in the shade
wisp this is just going to add an even
more dewy glowy appearance to the skin
so I'm applying that on the tops of my
cheekbones on my nose and anywhere I
want to look more glowy now I'm going to
move on to my eyes I'm going to keep it
very simple just to match the rest of my
face makeup ever already primed my eyes
and I'm going to go in with a fluffy
brush and dip it into the morphe
eyeshadow and es 1/3 and I'm just going
to move my brush in windshield wiper
motions and apply this into my crease
now I'm going to take this vanilla shade
it is es5 for also from morphe and on a
pencil brush I'm just applying this
underneath my brow bone to highlight and
then I'm going to take this eye shadow
also from morphe it is es seven six and
I'm applying this to my entire eyelid
wet so I did what the eye shadow just to
intensify it a little bit more and I am
just applying this on my entire lid all
the way up to my crease
after that I'm going to take that same
highlighting shade I use underneath my
brow bone and apply it to my inner
corners to highlight that area too then
I'm going to go back into the original
shade we use first and applying this
underneath my lower lashes just to smoke
it out a little bit and then to finish
off the eyes I am just using my L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara on my
top and bottom lashes so to complete
this look I'm going to use this over a
long lasting liquid lipstick in the
shade Rio I'm applying a light layer to
my lips and then I'm going to dab it
with my finger just so that it's not too
intense and opaque and I'm just going to
top it off with this le girls jelly lip
gloss it's a nice peachy color so that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
