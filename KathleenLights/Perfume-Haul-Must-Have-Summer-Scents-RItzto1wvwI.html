really random well actually not like
really random we're just going to be
talking about perfumes in this video and
sometimes I'm hesitant to do video on
perfumes because they don't really do so
well they're not videos that get a lot
of use or anything like that but if
there's anyone out there like me
watching my videos maybe you like this
video I am addicted to watching perfume
videos online I love learning about
perfumes I love discovering perfumes
like I love everything about perfumes
and even though they're not everyone's
favorite videos I really like watching
both kinda video so maybe there are
people out there like me in the world so
if there are videos for you and don't
mind me I know I'm like hunched over
like this but I'm sitting on like a
stool on my floor just so that I'm in
frame I'm getting so tired not tired but
I had the same background for a really
long time and I am NOT ready to get rid
of my vanity Danni built it I mean I
actually will never get rid of it let's
be honest like this will be mine forever
and I know people are sick and tired of
my same vanity but it is my vanity it's
my baby so I am switching things up I
told you guys a while ago I'm really hot
I told you guys a while ago that I was
redoing my room and I'm still in the
process of doing that but there is one
thing that's going down in my bathroom
and I can't fix this room until my
bathroom is done but anyway why I mean
I'm telling you this is because this is
my cat chest couch iPhone all my cats
videos here and I decided to just sit in
front of my couch today and film this
video because I just wanted to see a new
background so you're going to get a
hunched over version of me and we're
going to talk about perfumes
so for today's video it's going to be
really casual and really laid-back
there's a lot of things happening in my
life this week and I actually have to
leave immediately after I film this
video so I wanted to do something a
little bit more casual and something a
little more chatty where I could really
just relax and talk to you guys and not
fear not feel pressure to do like a
video so I'm going to talk to you guys
about some recent perfumes that were
just brought into my life so it's kind
of like a what I've been trying out kind
of video like a mini haul and then I'm
going to talk to you guys about my
favorite perfumes to wear in the summer
time like this time of year these are
the perfumes I'm really loving some are
new favorites some are old favorites and
you know let's just just start so Kat
Von D recently came out with her st. and
thinner perfumes and they were sent to
me in CR I just recently got
these are perfumes that have come out in
the past she had a saint and sinner
perfume like a while ago and it did
really well so she brought it back and
this is what the bottles look like the
other one looks exactly like this but it
is completely black and actually gave
that one away this is the only one I
kept because I don't really like the way
the sinner perfume smells I like really
sweet scents like that is my main thing
I love a sweet sugary scent it just
mixes really well with my body chemistry
and I also like clean scents or fresh
scents like citrus scents but I really
do not prefer a floral scent like smell
smell oldish on me like my skin hates it
and this one is actually described as a
floral on the sephora website says it's
a classic floral that has vanilla musk
and jasmine and honestly I don't know if
I smell that I do smell the vanilla me
it smells kind of like vanilla mixed
with a fruity scent
I don't find this floral at all spitting
everywhere I don't know me it actually
smells like Britney Spears fantasy nope
yeah fantasy it reminds me of what
celebrity perfumes used to smell like
back in the day I know that sounds
really strange but I feel like I had a
lot of perfumes growing up that smelled
like this but I do like this person who
I think it's nice it's definitely not my
favorite I will continue to use this but
when it's done I just don't see myself
purchasing this I don't I don't think it
lasts that long on the skin and I was
shocked that I didn't like the sinner
perfume because that's the one I was
looking forward to the most the
description on the Sephora website says
patchouli wood and cinnamon all things I
love I don't know I don't like it
there's something about this dinner
perfume that smells like old like really
that sounds really neat but it smells
very mature and very powdery at least on
my skin I applied it and I let it dry
and everything and even like as I was
wearing it throughout the day I didn't
like the scent of it but I has amazing
reviews online and I don't know I don't
know what it is because I usually love
musky scent often another type of
fragrance I love I look like musky
woodsy almost masculine but kind of sexy
scent I really love those and I just it
didn't like sense I gotta say I'm good I
also received the Urban Decay go naked
perfume oil I was so excited for this
because I love
perfume oils I have the flower bomb
perfume oil that I love to layer with
the flower pump perfume and honestly I
feel like it makes such a difference
it takes flower bomb and then it extends
it like ten times more I love it so I
was like oh my gosh I cannot wait to try
this I thought it would be perfect for
the summer time to wear like in the pool
or in the beach because oils that really
come off so easily but I don't like this
perfume either I don't like sense like
this all that much I love coconut beachy
sense but I don't like sense that smell
too much like sunscreen and online
lavender is actually one of the notes I
don't think I smell the lavender and I
love lavender to me this smells like
soap when I wear it on my skin and it's
been on for a few hours
it smells like soap like dishwashing
soap it just doesn't mix well with my
body I feel like my skin doesn't like
sense like this I don't like replica
Boardwalk I know that one's really
famous I don't like the Estee Lauder
summer presume I don't like Bobby Brown
Beach I've never liked sense like that
except another one that I'm going to
show you in a little bit they just don't
smell good on me and this is one of
those products that just doesn't smell
good on me and I wish it did because I
love for a few months but you know that
is one I'm definitely passing on
speaking of perfume oils I just recently
purchased this which is why I wanted to
include in this video I got the Giorgio
Armani sea oil I purchased this on the
Ulta website and I'm so excited for this
the only perfume oil I've seen make a
difference and how long my perfume lasts
is Flowerbomb but to me fireball already
lasts a really long time on my skin
regardless but I really wanted to try
this because see is one of my favorite
perfumes of all time definitely top five
for sure it's one of my perfumes that I
wear whenever I'm feeling really down if
I'm going through it if I'm really sad I
will usually put on see there's
something about this perfume that makes
me really happy and I have just been
dying to try this oil when I saw it at
Ulta so I recently bought it and I'm so
exciting dream does smell a little bit
stronger this is like a muted version
but sinks right into the skin - I don't
know how feeling I'm really gonna like
this I've never tried it but I just
thought reviewing let me know in the
comments below do you believe in perfume
oils or do you think they're a gimmick
like let me know because I have tried a
few that I feel like don't really work
okay so let's talk about some body
splash this is the Bath and Body Works
and vanilla fine fragrance myths and
this actually has natural almond oil in
it which i think is pretty amazing
I really am addicted to it to anything
almond scented I hate almond I hate
eating them but I love smelling them I
just got this that's why it's barely
been used but for the past week I have
been spraying this on my body to go to
bed and it is amazing I spray it
literally everywhere because I love
wearing perfumes to go to bed but I
don't like it to be too strong because
if not I won't fall asleep I'll just get
a headache so I prefer like body
splashes like this but this one is so
yummy yet it's not overpowering it's
just absolutely delicious if you love
almonds you need this in your life go to
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's so so good you
just not a vanilla but it's not like a
super sweet grosser now it's just so I
was recently sent this a little perfume
from Tarte this is their sweet tart
perfume which by the way that is the
cutest name in the world that is that is
the cutest name in the world that is
still smart because it's a sweet perfume
and the brand tart sweet tarts with
absolutely perfect but this is their
newest fragrance it's the only size that
comes in I hope they release like a
bigger version of this because I really
do love this scent
I think it's an also exclusive because I
can't seem to find it anywhere else it's
currently sold out which totally sucks
but I really really love this scent the
notes are very very fruity but I do
smell like that base of the vanilla and
it also has sandalwood in it which I
totally love I just really like how this
smells and I usually don't like roller
balls because they're just so annoying I
prefer a travel spray but this
rollerball rollerball this rollerball
isn't too tight in there so you do get a
lot of product while you're applying it
on the skin some roller balls like
nothing comes out this one is pretty
good if you're a sweet scent lover like
me you might say like this okay so the
next fragrance I just recently bought
it's actually a hair fragrance this is a
hair perfume from the brand toca toca
and I'm not sure if this product is new
in general it says new on Sephora but
they recently came out with four
different hair cents and I purchased the
one called Stella which is the only one
sold out online of course but I really
wanted to try this out especially sell
it because it
the best reviews on the Sephora website
I am a Sephora review reader you've left
a review on Sephora chances I've
probably read it and Stella was getting
the most hype so that's the one I
purchased and when I read the
description of each one this is the one
that I thought I was going to like the
most and let me tell you I have a few
here perfume actually have quite a few
if a perfume I really really really love
has a matching hair fragrance I will buy
it just because I'm extra like that when
it comes to perfume I'll spray that all
over my body and then I'll take the her
perfume and spray it on my hair even
though I have sprayed regular perfume on
my hair multiple holdable eyes but I've
never really noticed a huge difference
until I purchased this now I just
recently got it but I can smell this in
my hair at the end of the day and I
haven't felt that way about any other
perfume for hair so I think this is
really really good the only thing I
don't love about this is I truly don't
love the scent there's something about
it that's a little bit too mature for me
it's described as a blood orange but I
usually love a blood orange scent and I
feel like this is mixed blood orange and
like something else
and that's something I got my hair looks
crazy today and that other something
else is what I can't get on board with I
don't know what it is I can't put my
finger on it but I don't love it but
once I apply it in my hair and it's
dried and it's been there for about an
hour and a half I think it smelled
delicious like I was walking by someone
and I had this in my hair and they were
like oh my gosh what perfume are you
wearing
and I actually wasn't wearing perfume
that day I only had like the hair
perfume on my head I think it dries down
to a very warm welcoming scent and I
really like how this makes my head smell
if you're someone like me who doesn't
wash their hair every single day and I'm
like the third or fourth day it's
starting to smell a little funky so you
have to add like dry shampoo and you
have to do stuff to it this with a
little bit of dry shampoo it's like I
just washed my hair
like I just lost mine and then the less
perfume I just recently purchased has
been my go-to I am obsessed with this
nylon I love for a few more than the
average bear I wear it all the time when
I wake up I spray it like I love to
smell good all day every day even when
I'm not going anywhere but sometimes
when I am going out I forget to spray
perfume so I keep this little guy in my
purse at all times
and it has taken over my life this is
the Jo Malone nectarine and blossom
honey Cologne while this is so good
my favorite Jo Malone cologne of all
time is blackberry and Bay if you smell
that
it's fantastic I like that one a little
bit more than this one and I had that
one in my purse for like eight months
straight and I kind of switched it out
to this guy actually they both smell
really really good I'm not gonna lie
this one kind of reminds me of
blackberry and Bay it has kind of like
an undertone but I definitely smell like
the peachy vibe in the notes that says
it has honey and peach but and I kind of
smell that just smells so delicious it's
a floral but it's not a powdery floral
or one that's going to make you smell
too mature it almost smells like a
garden covered in sugar I mean look
where I am by already and I just bought
this which I mean totally sucks because
jo Malone is not cheap it is not cheap
that's expensive anyway those are some
perfumes I just recently picked up I
feel like that is a video all in itself
or some of those were sent to me but it
was kind of like a whole kind of by the
way if you hear all that noise there's
construction still going on in my house
okay so now I want to talk to you guys
about a few scents that are holy grails
for summer in my opinions I truly rare
these non-stop in the summer time some
of these have been holy groves for a
long time and a couple of these are
pretty new I will say pink sugar is one
of those perfumes that I wear a lot in
the summer my name looks completely gone
I have like five of these little bottles
scattered around my entire house I love
pink sugar it's one of my favorites but
besides that this has got to be my
absolute favorite one hands-down the
best perfume to wear in the summer ever
this is actually a celebrity perfume and
it's Miami glow by jennifer lopez and
this is just a delicious sweet coconut
vanilla yet sexy summer scent it's like
everything I could dream of in one
bottle every single time I wear this
perfume I get compliments I have a bunch
of bottles on deck because I really
cannot find this anywhere anymore unless
it's like on Amazon online sometimes you
can find it at Walmart
it's not something you can get really
easily but oh my gosh you need this in
your life if you've never smelled this
perfume and you are into summer scents
you need this it's one of a few
celebrity perfumes that actually like
one of the few that actually stays on my
skin the entire day like this lasts a
really long time on my skin it's like
incredible JLo you can do no home in
actually don't like any of JLo's other
scents except still I like still but the
rest I'm like that one Tigers if you
guys do not have Escada turquoise summer
and you're going on a tropical vacation
soon what are you waiting for unique
it's not like sunscreen E and beachy and
sandy no it's like fruity and like pina
colada E and like strawberries I just
pulled up the notes on Sephora and this
is blackcurrant blackcurrant and another
thing I really love and perfumes like
patchouli or blackcurrant and you've got
my heart and Escada is actually a more
affordable perfume brand and I really
really like them so I'm going to
perfumes lasts all day on me like moon
sparkle lasts forever on my skin this
one lasts a decent amount of time but
it's pretty affordable and I think it's
so worth it is my second bottle I mean
they're tiny but I've already gone
through an entire one it is delish so I
recently spoke about this for like a
second in my favorites video but you
need this this is brand new I just
recently got this and I don't think it
released that long ago either this is
the Bath and Body Works fine fragrance
mist and it's called at the beach and
when you wear this you literally feel
like you're at the beach you know like I
can't think of a better name so this
perfume
I really can't this is probably the only
beachy scent that I can get on board
with I was shocked at how much I like
this but honestly it gives you that
beachy saltwater coconut smell without
it smelling like straight-up sunscreen
and chemicals it smells like a yummy I
want to eat you version of those kinds
of cents
it doesn't last an incredibly long time
on the skin I will say that it's the
only downside to this I really wish it
lasted a lot longer because it truly
does not you definitely have to reapply
throughout the day but you just throw
this in your beach bag take it to the
beach and I think it's worth it it is
this one is definitely a must-have for
me in the summer time I've worn this for
like seven years
it is Victoria's Secret bombshell and I
have to be honest I'm not a huge fan of
Victoria Secret perfumes there are a few
really like I like very sexy I like
scandalous I think that's what it's
called I'm not sure it's meat nothing
holds a candle to bombshell it's the one
that lasts the longest on my skin
Victoria Secret perfumes are like
notorious for not lasting on me but this
one does last a long time at least the
perfume does the body splash not so much
but I love this scent it smells so sexy
like so delicious and fresh like really
fresh I love it it's another very fruity
scent in my opinion I love pretty scent
in the summertime so much but it has a
sexy twist it's just one of those
perfumes that when I run out of this
like I will this summer I will
immediately go out and repurchase it
again I find it on the Victoria Secret
website and it is a must-have for me in
the summer time like so much okay and
then last but not least is this guy this
is the Sud I'm not sure how to say this
brand food maybe food Pacific does it
seek South Pacific top of it and this is
the scent vanilla cocoa which is vanilla
coconut and I feel like this brand is
very hit-or-miss for me they have
something called vanilla extreme that
literally gave me a headache like no
other perfume has ever given me a
headache before it was so strong I had
to get rid of it I did I get this one in
vanilla cocoa oh my gosh this like takes
me right back to the Bahamas it's crazy
I haven't really worn this sometime went
to the Bahamas and it's like right back
there again this sounds like three notes
and it is so good it's not too strong to
wear it gives you a headache but it's
powerful enough to where you really
really smell this throughout the entire
day it's one of those perfumes I love
wearing in the water like in the beach
in the lazy river in the pool in the
water it smells like even better I know
that's weird but it does it is summer
and sunshine in a bottle like I just
picture someone on a hammock underneath
the tree sipping a piña colada
underneath a coconut tree might I add
it's really good stuff and if you're
into vanilla and coconut like together
you need this you will love it ok guys
so that completes this video these are
first fumes I recently purchased or they
were recently
and to me and then I also wanted to give
you guys some of my favorite scents to
wear this time of year I hope this video
wasn't too long or too boring because I
know it would like perfume videos I'm
sorry
love me Lima France I know a lot of you
guys have been asking me for my top
favorite perfumes of all time but it's
pretty much the same the only one that
has stood on itself in the mix is
definitely Valentino Dona that one is
like amazing the kind of bumped another
one to like the sixth spot but it's
pretty much the same as my last top
slide anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this video leave me a comment down below

it's a sweet or fruity and I haven't
checked it out
