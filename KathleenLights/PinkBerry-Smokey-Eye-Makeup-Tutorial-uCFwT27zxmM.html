tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now this is pretty much pretty much
basically the look I was wearing in my
favorites video my February favorites
it was so funny because when I sat down
to do my makeup for that video I brought
out all of my reddish pinkish orange e
ish cranberry shade and I just sat them
on the table and I was just like dipping
into them and just doing my makeup I
really wasn't thinking about it and then
I was so overwhelmed by how many of you
guys wanted a tutorial on this look when
I posted my favorites video and I
started reading through the comments I
was like David why didn't I write them
down why didn't they put the shadows
beside so I knew exactly what I used but
I didn't do that cuz I'm an idiot and I
didn't think you guys who want a
tutorial on this look since I always do
warm smoky eyes like this so of course I
had to recreate the look for you guys I
pretty much did use all the eyeshadows I
used I used the majority of the ones I
remember there are obviously some stand
out eyeshadows like the one on my lid
the outer corners like I definitely use
the same eyeshadows I used last time but
they were probably a couple that I
missed that I don't remember and the
rest of my face is exactly the same
except my highlight and try a different
highlight in this video can you guess
what highlight I tried out today is
brand new is by a youtuber yeah I
changed my highlight but I thought that
you guys wouldn't mind that is just the
highlight so if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep watching
okay so for the eyes portion of this
video we are totally doing at Ospital
because I don't remember how I did it I
mean I remember how I did it but I don't
remember the exact shades I used I
remember most of the shades I remember
that it was mainly these shades right
here I gathered all of them and I put
them in this little metal pin palette
mostly color pops but a few other brands
in here as well so we're going to work
off of this because I'm pretty sure
these are the shades I used yeah I've
already primed my eyes and I set down
the primer with some face powder so
we're all primed or
to go the first shade i'm going in with
is this one bicolor top is called wake
up call and on a fluffy blending brush
I'm just going to be applying this color
into my crease this is going to be our
transition shade I'm just going to apply
this all over the place mainly in the
crease but all over the place
then I thought I'm going to use is the
makeup geek eyeshadow in the shade of
copy and I'm going to focus this color
in my crease as well but I'm going to
teach this one a little bit lower than
the other one I don't want it to pass my
crease I just want to add a pop of this
color in my crease okay so I actually
think I added a little bit of chickadee
in my crease just a little bit of this
this is a makeup geek eyeshadow okay so
this next part I definitely remember
this especially because I brush the head
of the eyes no residue on it
I sent the color pop eyeshadow in the
shade stay golden and I use this flowery
low one brush and I just packed this on
my entire lid I'm also going to just
bring this color into my crease like you
see me doing right here just kind of
blending out the edges a little bit we
will go in and blend in a second but you
know
okay so I'm going to take this eyeshadow
from anastacio called blazing and I'm
just going to use this color in my
crease I'm going to blend out any of the
harsh edges that that red shadow created
I am almost positive I used this
eyeshadow okay so I totally remember
going into this eyeshadow right here
this is called note to self and I'm just
going to use this eyeshadow to really
blend out my crease I'm going to take
the colour-pop eyeshadow called hear me
out and I'm just going to use this to
highlight my brow bone and to kind of
clean up that area I'm going to take a
little bit more of chickadee by makeup
geek and I'm just going to dust a little
bit of this in my crease it's just going
to give a subtle warmth to the crease
I'm going to go back into that color we
used on the lid and I'm just going to
intensify it a little bit okay so this
part I remember perfectly I went in with
the Make Up For Ever eyeshadow in the
shade
m8 for four I'm just going to focus this
color on the outer corners and drag this
into my crease a little bit but I'm not
going to move it towards the inner part
of my eyelid just focusing this right at
the outer corners and a bit in my crease
I'm going to take that first crease
shade we used in the beginning call the
wake-up call by color pop and I'm just
going to blend some of this color into
the crease just to make sure you know
we're blending
okay so for this part I'm going to do
this step even though I don't think it's
necessary just because I know that this
is what I did and I don't want it to
alter the finished look so I took the
shade highest rung from colour-pop and
what I did was I took it on my finger
and I started to pack this on my inner
corners here like on the inner parts of
my lid but then I did that and I didn't
really love it
so I took this chain roulette this is my
makeup geek and I'm just going to apply
this eyeshadow right on top I just like
how this one looks better it gives it a
more golden peachy tone versus
high-strung that one is a little bit
more like rose gold but more pinky this
one's more gold I'm going to touch that
up at the very end but I'm going to go
ahead and do the next step I'm going to
take the NARS eyeshadow in the shade
Coconut Grove it's just a very dark
almost black brown but it's brown and on
a small crease brush I'm just going to
add this to the outer corners right here
and just going to start blending this
I'm going to build up this color slowly
because I don't want it to be too harsh
or too intense and I'm just going to
lightly drag this into the crease but
that's it like no more than that
I'm going to go back into chickadee
one more time and just do the exact same
thing just this in my crease and then
I'm just going to intensify the brown
just a little bit but like right at the
outer edge I'm not going to drag this up
now I'm just going to take a makeup
remover white and I am going to clean up
all the fallout because well you know
there's a lot okay so moving on to the
face I'm using the backup first light
priming filter and I'm just going to use
this to prime my skin I love this you
guys notice
so I'm putting that underneath my
foundation and I'm going to be mixing
two foundations today I'm going to take
the Giorgio Armani power fabric
foundation and I'm going to mix it with
the number seven lift and luminate
foundation I just did one pump of the
Armani one and then one pump of the
number seven one mix it together on the
back of my hand and applied it to my
entire face and I'm using the new
Ecotools sponge and I love it for
concealer I'm going to take the NARS
soft matte complete concealer in the
shade vanilla and on this tiny little
brush I'm going to apply this underneath
my eyes this is going to cover up my
dark circles and it's also going to
brighten the skin a little bit I'm going
to use this concealer to highlight
certain parts of my face as well and
then I'm going to set that down using
the cover effects loose translucent
setting powder I love this I'm just
going to set pretty much my entire face
I should have changed my brush but I
didn't some just said in the face okay
so to finish up the eyes I'm going to
quickly just highlight some more
underneath the brow bone because a lot
of it was blended away I'm going to add
that pretty intensely and then I'm just
going to blend everything together and
then I'm going to add some more just so
that everything is nice and blended into
each other
then I'm going to take chickadee one
more time and I'm just gonna blend it
right there into the cuvee so for my
lower lashline I'm going to take that
Make Up For Ever eyeshadow and I'm just
going to buff this on my lower lashes
like I said all the way across so from
outer corner all the way to inner corner
I want this color to look pretty intense
and then I'm going to take the color pop
eyeshadow and note to self and I'm just
going to blend out the harsh edges for
eyeliner I'm going to take the Marc
Jacobs eyeliner and fine wine I know
everyone's been using these recently but
they're so amazing they're really good
I'm just applying that to my waterline
and I'm tight lining with this as well
and then I'm going to blend that out
with a pencil brush because I apply a
lot to my lower lash line so that I can
smudge it and it looks nice and red and
mokey I like the look of red under eyes
I know not everybody does but I think it
looks pretty cool with this look and
then I just blended it some more with
that same color pop eyeshadow then I
stepped with this shade right here this
is the NARS single shadow in Coconut
Grove and I am just applying this right
at the outer corners I'm not driving
this color in I'm just keeping that
right at the end and then I took some
more of that Brown and applied it to the
top just to deepen up that shade a
little bit from an inner corner
highlight I took the pixie Chloe powder
in century since it then I applied some
mascara and pop on the Ardell falsies in
1 1 3 okay so now that I'm done with my
eyes completely I'm going to take some
of that roulette shade we used on the
entire lid and I'm just going to
intensify it a little bit my lashes did
not go on correctly I totally messed up
on this eye I just couldn't put them on
right today it was a really bad day for
lashes I even picked up my hair I was
like so frustrated and hot so yeah my
lashes is totally wonky but it's at
midnight okay I'm going to put on the
rest of my makeup to finish up the face
I'm going to take my Physicians Formula
butter bronzer
and I'm going to contour with this I'm
going to speed this up because you've
seen me contour especially with this
bronzer like 100 trillion times
I'm just contouring the face you know
huge and then I'm going to warm up the
skin just a little bit with this Milani
baked bronzer in Dulce and I'm just
going to apply this a little bit more
liberally than I did with the Physicians
Formula one I'm putting this everywhere
and just giving my skin and overall
warmth for blush I'm going to take the
Laura Mercier blush in the shade Wynn
flush and I'm building this color up
because it is a little bit sheer but I'm
building up on my cheeks and I just love
this color okay so in my favorites video
I highlighted with the pixie lily powder
in the shade santorini sunset that was a
highlight that was on my face it was in
my favorites video but I just got this
in the mail this is the anastacio glow
kit with Nicole Guerrero this is her
collab and oh my gosh I am so excited to
try this out I love Nicole Guerrero I
have been watching her from the
beginning I have been watching her since
she had red hair like red hair I love
her she's like an OG for me and I love
her I love her so much so I'm so excited
to try this out
they do look glittery to me when I look
at them in the pan a lot of people keep
saying that there aren't any glitters
but I see glitter when I look at this
the only ones that don't really have
that much glitter are these three but I
have famous because I love the glow kits
the only glow kit I didn't like was
their newest one I'm going to take the
shade Forever Young because I feel like
this one it's going to be light enough
for me
I really like that color so really
pretty pink but on the skin it comes off
a little lighter which I like that is so
and then oh my gosh oh my gosh I broke a
nail by the way look at that I broke it
I know we're doing so good they were
getting so long Danna
if you have a lot of texture on your
skin you might not like these highlights
but I mean what highlight doesn't
emphasize texture there are very few
that don't emphasize the texture they
have to be like extremely natural which
I like as well but sometimes I like a
little bit of a glow like this
I definitely applied too much right here
in the in the center and you blend that
we blend out with my blush brush maybe
that'll be smarter and my bronzer brush
so yeah I'm just dusting off there are
like little tiny glitters but when you
go like this like this the way okay so
you already know I need to set my face
with the Milani make it last setting
spray it's my favorite I cannot stop
using this I can't I can't I don't even
touch my other setting sprays I just
want to make a smile and a disclaimer
really quick I don't know why but I went
setting spray happy
I applied way too much setting spray I
live borderline oily in this video not
that that's bad I just I did apply way
too much setting spray and I kind of
asked with my foundation mixture so I
look a little greasy I know I apologize
just wanted to make that disclaimer okay
back to the video so miss why would I
try to talk well I'm gonna the mist on
this is just so good so good so while I
let that dry on my skin I'm going to go
ahead and finish up the look by adding
my lip color this is the lip color I was
wearing in my favorites video so of
course I'm going to put it on today this
is the colour-pop ultra satin lip in the
shade Aquarius
