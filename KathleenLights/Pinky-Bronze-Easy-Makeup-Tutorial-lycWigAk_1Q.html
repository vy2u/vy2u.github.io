a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now it's a really simple
golden eye with a pinky lip I think it's
perfect for work or for college or
whatever you want it's very easy really
excited because today's video is
sponsored by NARS I'm going to be
sharing with you their new velvet lip
glide this one is in the shade play pin
these come in 13 different colors so I'm
sure you'll be able to find like your
perfect color to match your skin tone I
really really like this pink shade I
kind of did the rest of my makeup based
off of the shade play pen I thought gold
eyes would look so pretty with this kind
of pink these are actually really cool I
like that they're called lip hybrids
because I feel like that's what they are
they do glide on like a lip gloss but
it's not sheer like a lip gloss
typically is so it has the full coverage
of a regular lipstick but the feeling of
lip gloss and it's also very hydrating
it kind of has like a velvety texture
and it has a semi matte finish like it's
not completely matte as you can see
there's a little bit of shine to it but
it's not super glossy either and it's
actually funny because each shade is
named after a 70s night club so playpen
was the name of a 70s night club which
is kind of cool so like I said these are
super comfortable super nourishing I
really really like these I like the
pigmentation but if you want to see how
to get this full look then just keep
watching so I'm starting off with my
glossy a priming moisturizer just to add
as a base for my foundation and then the
foundation I'm going in with is my
Shiseido's synchros gained foundation
I'm using the shade golden 2 and I am
just bouncing that in with my pure
sponge
now I'm going to go in with concealer
I'm using the NARS creamy radiant
concealer in the shade vanilla and I'm
just using this to hide my dark circles
and highlight my face as well so I'm
applying it on my nose and in between my
eyebrows and on my chin and I am just
blending that in with that same sponge
I'm going to set everywhere I put down
that concealer with the RCM a no color
powder I'm using this brush this is like
a highlighting brush from Smith's
cosmetics and I am just dusting that
wherever I put the concealer for bronzer
I'm using the NARS Laguna bronzer with
my Real Techniques blush brush and I'm
really just bronzing up the skin with
this bronzer I didn't want to sit there
and contour because I feel like it's
kind of a natural look I mean it's a lot
of makeup but the look is very natural
so I just wanted to make sure that my
skin looks nice and bronzed and warm so
I'm just applying that everywhere for
blush I'm going in with the Milani baked
blush in the shade Luminoso it's a very
it has a sheen to it so it's a very
glowy blush and it has a nice peachy
tone to it so I'm just applying that to
my cheeks and then I'm going to take
this Physicians Formula translucent
pearl highlight and I'm popping that on
with fan brush but then I decided to
just go in with that Smith brush I used
earlier just to pack on the color a
little more and I'm just highlighting my
face like I always do and now I'm going
to go ahead and do my eye makeup I'm
just applying an eyeshadow base this is
the Milani almond cream crayon stick and
now I'm going to take the Milani bella
eyes eye shadow in the shade Bella
cappuccino with my morphe r40 brush and
I'm just buffing this into the crease
I'm going to take this color pop
eyeshadow in the shade and I'm just
applying this all over my lid with my
finger these apply really well with your
finger so I'm just applying this
everywhere it's such a pretty golden
bronze shade perfect for everyday and
then I'm just going to take a little bit
more of that Bella cappuccino shade to
blend out any of the harsh edges I'm
going to take by the cappuccino again
and I'm take
on an Ecotools pencil brush I'm just
running that on my lower lash line I'm
going to take this eyeliner from the
brand Shea Moisture and this is in the
shade of brown I'm just tight lining
with this and applying it to my
waterline and then I wanted something
extra smoky kind of like an eyeliner
look but in brown so I used the NARS
eyeshadow in the shade kalapa goes on a
tiny little pencil brush this is a zoeva
240 brush really really close to my
waterline and my tight line and just
making sure it looks nice and smudgy and
then I went back in with Bella
cappuccino just to blend everything out
for underneath my brow bone for a little
bit of a highlight I'm taking the middle
shade of this Jake at triple crown baked
shadow in the shade cherry fudge sundae
and then for my inner corner I just
mixed the top two shades together
applying my Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara and then that completes the eyes
so I wanted a little bit more of a
highlight so I took that middle shade
from the Jade cat eye shadow and just
applied it to the tops of my cheekbones
just to add a little bit more of a glow
factor but to finish off this look I'm
going to go in with the NARS Velvet lip
light and the shade play pen such a
pretty pink really really love this but
yeah guys that completes this video I
