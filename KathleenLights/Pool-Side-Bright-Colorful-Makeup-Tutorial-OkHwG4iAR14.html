a makeup tutorial on me look I'm wearing
right now I wanted to play around with
the new makeup geek foiled eyeshadows so
this is the look I came up with I was
really interested in that Pegasus
Pegasus shade so that is the look I came
up with everything on my eyes like all
the eyeshadows i'm using are actually
all makeup geek so this is like a makeup
geek a tutorial a geek is so amazing i
love it every time I do a look using
makeup geek shadows I'm never
disappointed so yeah if you want to see
how to get this full face look then just
keep watching hey guys so of course I'm
priming with Mac painterly paint-pot
as usual and then I'm going to set that
base with makeup geek eyeshadow and
Rapunzel it has a little bit of a sheen
to it
but I'm just using it to set that Paint
Pot this is another makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade high tea it's a
really pretty greenish Brown and this is
going to be my transition shade this
honestly gets lost in the makeup but I
do use it in my crease so that all the
other colors can blend a little bit
better this is a beautiful shadow called
wisteria it's such a vibrant purple I
love it and I'm gonna do the exact same
thing just focusing this into my crease
but bringing it a little bit higher in
my crease as well all of the eyeshadows
I'm using today are making 8 by the way
just letting you know so this is a
foiled eyeshadow in the shade
amazing pulao list it's so pretty it's
like a teal these apply best with your
fingers but Yolo I'm using an elf
eyeshadow brush did I just say Yolo Wow
okay move along so I'm just packing this
on my entire lid up bringing it right up
to the crease
this is mega Peaks corrupt the blackest
black eyeshadow I have ever seen on a
mac 217 oh by the way I just applied
tape but I completely forgot to show
that I mentioned that but I applied tape
to create kind of like a cat eye so I'm
taking this black eyeshadow and I'm
really focusing this right where the
tape meets and then I'm going to take
kind of like a dense fatter pencil brush
and I'm really going to pack this a
black color really really close to the
tape
I want the outer corners of my eye to
appear really really black and then just
fade into that blue I'm going back into
with Syria this is just a fluffy
blending brush and I'm just gonna pack
more of that color I'm going to
intensify the crease I want it to be
extra purple right up in there I'm gonna
pack some more Pegasus on my lid because
since we added so many eye shadows on
top and blend it so much a lot of it did
get lost this is another foiled
eyeshadow in the shade fantasy it's a
beautiful silvery green very green but
liked too I love it it's so pretty but
I'm gonna go on top of it with that
Rapunzel shade I love how Rapunzel looks
on top of fantasy it makes it like a
light yellow a green I don't know it's
it really pretty I like it I'm also
going to use that to highlight my brow
bone as well okay so moving on to the
face before I finish my eyes this is the
Napoleon Curtis skin Pilate primer or
something like that it's a really
moisturizing primer I really like it on
top of that I'm going to use the Laura
Mercier still cream foundation I'm going
to apply that with my Beauty Blender and
I am in the shade bamboo beige when I'm
tan as you can see my body is tense
so yeah for concealer I'm mixing these
two I'm going to take this nyx HD
concealer in the shade of beige i'm
applying that underneath my eyes and
then i'm going to add some of the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer in the shade
a fair neutral or like I remember light
neutral
yep fair no it's very neutral yes fair
okay so you know the drill just blending
all that stuff in with my Beauty Blender
okay moving on so I'm gonna set
underneath my eyes so that the concealer
just increase into my fine lines this is
the NARS press crystal powder
I believe that's what it's called I will
leave the real name down below so I'm
going to finish off my eyes I'm going
into Pegasus with this pencil brush by
makeup geek it's not called a pencil
brush but it looks like one so I'm just
going to apply this on the inner part of
my eye on the lower lash line then I'm
going to take wisteria and I'm gonna
apply this to the rest of my lash line
blending those two colors together I'm
gonna line my waterline and my tight
line with NYX gel liner in black it's my
favorite you guys know and then which
take corrupt one more time and I am just
gonna blend everything together so that
it doesn't look like I have like one
harsh line on my waterline I want it to
be really really smoky on the lower lash
line so I'm applying some of that black
so it's not just completely colorful it
has that really pretty like blackness to
it I'm applying mascara and this is the
Maybelline lash
all right to finish off my face I'm
going to take the bombs a bomb desert
blush flash bronzer it's supposed to be
both you can get this on the bombs
website and I'm going to apply that to
my cheeks with a deli M tools like tulip
shape tulip shaped brush I'm using this
to contour and I'm also like applying it
everywhere since it has kind of like a
pink undertone and then the blush I'm
using on top of it is the bombs hot mama
it's very similar to NARS orgasm I'm not
applying a highlight on top of it
because it has that really pretty golden
peachy sheen and I think it's hides
really nicely with this look for my lips
I'm going to take this one by covergirl
and it is called honeyed bloom it's a
really pretty baby pink I think it goes
well with these eyes too so that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching I really hope you
enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
