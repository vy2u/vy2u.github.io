tutorial on this look it's a nice deep
almost purple almost purple smokey eye
with a pop of royal blue in the
waterline I'm not sure if you can tell
so much on camera but in person you can
really see the pop of blue I used mainly
the morphe 35 K palette that I hadn't
gotten a chance to use and I loved it so
creamy so buttery so smooth I loved it
but I did use one eyeshadow in this
palette this is the morphe 35c and I
pretty much just use this dark brownish
purple eyeshadow but mostly I use the
other palette just I needed that one
shadow from this palette but of course
you use whatever shadows you have at
home that are similar I also give you
two different lip options one more
wearable which is the one I'm wearing
right now obviously this is the one that
I would wear but I thought it would be
fun to switch it up and show you like a
pop of blue on the lips as well to kind
of match the waterline and I think it
looks really really cool if you're into
a more bold look I'm gonna leave a
little time in the description box to
tell you like where the tutorial
actually starts because really quickly I
want to give you guys my thoughts on the
hourglass vanish foundation I believe
that's what it's called
because I used it for the first time in
the video and I have a few thoughts so
if you actually do not give a rat's ass
about this I will list down below when
the tutorial starts but basically I love
this and I hate this that I like I
completely completely love the formula
which i think is the most important
thing like I'm wearing it on my face
right now and I didn't need to set it I
mean I set my t-zone and everywhere I
put concealer like I usually do but I
feel like it's not even on my face it
doesn't doesn't feel like I'm wearing
foundation at all but it has really
amazing coverage actually mixed two
shades today because I didn't know what
my shade was I didn't think I was gonna
love another stick foundation the way
that I love the ultra HD stick from Make
Up For Ever that's my favorite
foundation stick and oh my gosh I think
I love this one just as much formula
wise formula wise I think
has an unreal amazing formula obviously
I haven't worn it throughout the day
because I just put it on and my opinion
can 100% change but it feels so natural
on the skin but it gives you really nice
coverage now the part I hate about this
this is so ridiculous this is a $46
foundation but you only get point 25
ounces but that's right that is that's
ridiculous in most foundations you get
one fluid ounce this is point 25 so
that's way too much money for what
you're getting and you will go through
this very quickly because when I opened
it today it was pretty much at the top
but look how much I've used and I had
used another foundation as well so that
is why I love it and I hate it I don't
know I don't know I really can't decide
because I love the formula like it feels
unreal but Wow
I feel like you would go through this
like this so yeah those are my thoughts
it's kind of wishy-washy I don't know I
got a lot of questions about this so I
just wanted to update your really quick
in the beginning of this video but
anyway if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching
so I'm priming my eyelids as usual using
the Urban Decay primer potion in the
shade enigma and blending that in with
my finger i am taking the morphe 35 k
palette and i'm taking the second shade
and i'm using this to set that primer
down because it could be a little tacky
if i don't set it then i'm going to take
this color right here and i'm going to
use this as my transition shade I'm
taking a big fluffy blending brush and I
am just buffing this into my crease
packing that color on little by little
and just really diffusing that out then
I'm going to go into this warm brown
shade this is such a pretty color I love
this eyeshadow and I am just applying
this on the outer corners of my eyes but
dragging this into my crease as well
kind of like the same thing I did with
the other shade but more concentrated in
the crease then I'm going to take the
Jordana eyeshadow pencil in the shade
tenacious Brown and I'm applying this on
my lid and then I'm going to take this
Marc Jacobs eyeshadow brush and I'm
really going to buff that color out this
color is a little bit hard to buff out
because these are really really long
where
during like chubby six so I really have
to take my time blending it out but I
love them they're amazing and then I
went into the morphe 35p palette and I
took that brown shade and just went
directly on top of that all the way up
to my crease and just blending that out
a bit this is a brush from Wet n Wild
it's one of their eyeshadow brushes now
I'm just going to go back into the 35k
palette and use the same eyeshadows I
used before and I'm just making sure
everything is nice and blended and there
are no harsh lines I'm going to mix
these two first colors right here and
I'm using that as my brow bone shade to
highlight underneath my brow bone and
then I'm going to move on to the face
i'm using the nyx angel veil primer to
prime my face i'm going to be using the
new hourglass vanish foundations this
one is warm ivory but I thought it might
be a little bit too dark but I end up
going in with the shade bisque after
right on top but I'm just kind of like
dotting this on my face and then I went
in with bisque and I'm using the brush
that it came with this was sent to me by
hourglass but I'm using the brush that
they recommend with it obviously you can
use whatever brush you want but I just
started to buff this into my face I
really why I mean I gave you my little
review in the beginning of this video
but I don't I don't know how to feel I
just but it feels so good on the skin
though I was so impressed buffing this
into my skin okay so now I'm going in
with the Tarte shape tape concealer this
one is in the shade light and I'm using
this to kind of hide my dark circles a
bit and then to highlight my face as
well I'm using a beauty sponge I bought
at Ulta I believe it's from the Ulta
brand it came with two of them it was
like a little sponge duo so I'm just
blending that in and now I'm going to go
over it with the RMS unpowered I'm gonna
talk about this a little bit more in my
favorites video but oh my gosh this
powder is amazing I still love my are
CMA the most but this one is special
I'll talk about it more in another video
but I'm just setting my concealer with
this powder and now to finish up the
eyes I'm taking my NYX totally black gel
eyeliner in the shade pitch-black and
only tightlining with this I don't want
this on my waterline I'm going to take
the in Inglot gel eyeliner in the shade
number 77 and I'm just applying this
really really close to my lashes I don't
want to wing but I don't want to leave
it bare either for my waterline though
I'm taking the Shea Moisture eyeliner in
the shade blue and I excuse me I know
this is out of focus and it was like
focusing on my huge forehead
I'm sorry not my intention but I'm just
putting that all over my waterline and
then I took the 35k palette again use
that same color I used in my crease and
I'm buffing that underneath my lower
lash line and then I went into this
Brown again with a smaller lead tube
into brush and I am just doing the same
thing buffing this on the lower lash
line I decided to take this OCC pure
pigment in the shade royal blue and with
an angled brush I pack that on my lower
lash line just to intensify the blue a
little bit I'm mixing these two shades
and I'm using that as my inner corner
highlight and then I went in with this
essence volumizing mascara and the
falsies I used or the ardell demi
whispies to finish off the face I am
taking my wet n wild contour palette I'm
using the contour side this is in the
shade dulce de leche I love this contour
palette it's amazing
I am contouring with the new morphe ei
53 brush
then I felt like my skin needed a little
bit more warmth in bronze eNOS so I took
the BH Cosmetics satin bronzer in the
shade totally tan and on this fluffy
Shiseido like face powder brush I am
just dusting this all over my face and
my neck a little bit
for blush I wanted something pinky but
neutral so I took the NYX powder blush
in the shade mauve this is a blush brush
by Sonia Kashuk and I'm just adding a
little bit of this on my cheeks and then
to highlight the tops of my cheekbones I
am using the elf baked blush in the
shade pink tastic to finish off this
look I'm going in with the more natural
lip color or lip option this is the
essence lip liner in the shade in the
nude
such a beautiful super super inexpensive
lip liner I love it and I'm going over
top of it with this gloss right here
this is the new colour-pop ultra glossy
lip and this one is in the shade fairy
floss it's one of their sheer formulas
such a pretty baby nudey pink but if you
want to be a little bit more bold a cool
lip option would be the Too Faced melted
matte liquid lipstick in the shade
hoozue min whoo so yeah that completes
