my beauty must haves in the summertime
kind of like a summer essentials video I
guess just products I've really been
loving this time of year and I know
we're like like halfway through summer
are we I don't know but I have a few
different it's kind of a random video
these are random products I have makeup
hair nails and stuff like that I just
thought it would be fun to share these
things with you guys so let's get
started I'm gonna start with body
products my favorite body products in
the summer and it's so funny okay cuz I
have been loving the brand Sun bum for
so long because if you don't know Danny
is in the military and they always have
Sun bum at my local next which is on
base and I had never seen Sun bum
anywhere else I thought it was like a
military thing like not a military thing
but a next thing recently I found out
that Ulta carries it I think and I have
been seeing Sun bum everywhere like I
think Katie has talked about it and desi
I've been seeing a lot of people talking
about Sun bum and I'm like oh my gosh I
love Sun bum and now people are starting
to discover it I feel and I've loved
them for so long I have a few quite a
few Sun bug products and I purchase them
all myself at my next but anyway so my
favorite SPF for my body is my son bum
SPF 50 water resistant for 80 minutes it
has vitamin E I love this one
specifically because it does not feel
greasy on my skin it's the only SPF that
I've truly loved I don't know how to
explain it it's very moisturizing but it
dries instantly it's really nice on the
skin and it smells really good it smells
like bananas like pure bananas it's
delicious
it is so moisturizing but not greasy
100% non greasy it's paraben free oil
free hypoallergenic won't clog pores
anti-aging and all that good stuff it's
honestly my favorite some people say
that you don't need anything more than
30 on your body but I just get SPF 50 to
be safe I guess so yes I love this and
you should apply your SPF multiple times
throughout the day if you are going to
the pool or if you're going to the beach
and you put on SPF at 9 a.m.
morning and then you forget about it and
don't put on SPF for the rest of the day
and then go home around 5:00 in the
afternoon you basically did absolutely
nothing because it does fade I recommend
putting it at least every two hours so
what I like to do I get in the pool a
lot because my mom does have a pool in
her yard
so SPF is so important to me but I also
really love using this this is the Sun
balm SPF 30 this is a sunscreen spray
like oh this one smells so good too this
one smells like bananas as well I love
this one because it does
soak up instantly and I don't have to
sit there and rub it and just you know
take up time of me being in the pool I
love this I do have to wait or I do dry
myself off like I dry myself and then
spray this everywhere I saturate my body
and it instantly absorbs into the skin
so I love putting this one on I'm
halfway through the day though I will
touch up with my 50 but then I
constantly like every time I get another
pool I constantly put this one on okay
so when it comes to SPF for my face i
100% prefer a physical SPF i've already
talked about this like a million times
in my videos that i feel like I
literally have spoken about this product
time and time again but I will again
this is the Josie Maran Argan daily
moisturizer SPF 47 again it still weighs
me out but it's 47 and not 50 or 45 but
whatever this is my favorite face
sunblock I love it if you don't know the
difference between a physical and a
chemical SPF this is a chemical SPF you
know that a physical SPF has zinc oxide
and titanium dioxide and then chemical
Spaeth has like a bunch of rap that I
don't know and they're both good don't
get me wrong they're both good I love
chemical ones for my body the difference
is a chemical SPF will absorb the UV
rays and then like throw them away a
physical SPF will just completely block
the UV rays but the reason I like
physical for my face is because it does
not break me out it doesn't clog my
pores it's I need physical for my face I
have very sensitive skin and it's the
only thing that won't really clog my
pores so I love this i slather this all
over my face and I reapply throughout
the day this is my favorite one because
it's so hydrating it honestly feels I
I am wearing a crazy like hydrating face
mask like it's so hydrating it sinks
right into my skin it does stay a little
bit like Dewey on my face but it's okay
I have dry skin I love this but when I
do want to wear something underneath my
makeup sometimes I'll use this but I
really really have been loving this one
underneath makeup this is the for first
aid beauty ultra Repair pure mineral
sunscreen moisturizer it has SPF 40
which is awesome and it's also a
physical SPF so this one actually goes
on more like a moisturizer this one is
kind of like a serum II moisturizer I
don't know the consistency is different
so this one does feel more like weight
underneath makeup so I really like that
one okay staying on with the body this
is a new product for me and I can thank
my friend in Sephora everybody has their
like perfect Sephora that they go to all
the time and I was really sad moving out
of Mississippi because I had like
everybody in the Sephora Mississippi
knew me because I was there all the time
so I had like friends there but I have
discovered a new friend in the Sephora
closest to me now her name is Carla and
I love her like every time I walk into
Sephora if she's not there I leave I'm
like oh Carla's not here I'm just going
I met her because one day I was in
Sephora and she came up to me like hey I
watch your videos and then we just
became really good friends Carly if
you're watching hi I bought this because
of you so this is the Becca luminous
body perfecting mousse she like sold it
to me she's always like taking me around
the store like oh we got this new this
is good this is good I totally trust her
opinion and I went online and I bought
it because she only gave me a sample to
try it out and I loved it so I purchased
it immediately this is basically like
foundation for your body it's like a
bronzing mousse I don't know how to
explain it but I love this on my legs
let me show you what it looks like it
looks like a bird poo prank
we're like doggy Duty and then it just
blends out and it gives you like a soft
you can tell you can tell I didn't put
enough but it gives you like a soft
color to your skin and it absorbs
immediately it smells so good it smells
like a perfume but like a really soft it
smells amazing
and it's not 100% waterproof but it is
water-resistant and it doesn't transfer
on my clothes I love it especially like
in the summertime if you're wearing
shorts and you're wearing a dress a
skirt and you want to go out and you
want your legs not to look like too
pasty and yes purchases cuz it's good it
just gives a soft nice touch to your
legs and just makes them look a little
bit bronzy I am going to talk about SPF
for lips though really quick so a lot of
people don't realize that we need SPF on
our lips more than anything our lips are
actually one of the most sensitive parts
like of our skin so make sure when
you're going out into the Sun that you
put on SPF on your lips these are my
favorite right here I love the fresh
sugar lip treatments this is the
original one which the writing came off
this was suspensive okay I don't I don't
appreciate the writing coming off it's
just a like clear lip treatment this is
really good I don't know if it's worth
the $22 to be completely honest with you
I mean it's nice mmm this one though I
do think it's worth it because it's like
a lipstick and a lip treatment in one
because it's has a color this one is in
the shade petal and it just gives you a
really pretty Mabi pink color to your
lips while adding SPF 15 they have a
nude one too so if you want a little bit
of color you can try those out but just
for straight-up
SPF I love the Sun bum chapstick I know
it's really basic and weird but it has
SPF 30 which is even more than the sugar
one I think SPF 30 is what you should be
putting on your lips and this one smells
like banana
they have different scents but bananas
my favorite and it's kind of slippy it's
like a chapstick it's not super thick
and hydrating like this is but it gets
the job done cuz it's got SPF so I
really like this and it's like 2 dollars
ok so since I've already kind of started
I'm just gonna keep going with the
makeup stuff for my face or if I'm going
out honestly I'm not going to lie I
don't put on foundation if I'm going to
like the beach the pool somewhere really
hot I'm not wearing I'm not wearing
makeup
I prefer tinted moisturizers BB creams
CC creams like those things something in
that category and these are my favorite
ones I have 5 to share with you that's
excessive I know I'm going to start with
my favorite drugstore BB cream this is
the dream pure BB cream by Maybelline I
don't like
original atoll the original was really
greasy on my skin and it didn't like it
I like this one I find that it's special
because it has salicylic acid which sits
really well on my skin and it doesn't
break me out salicylate Oh salicylic
acid is good for my skin I love it but
new one I've really been into is this
one right here this is the Laura Mercier
tinted moisturizer this is SPF 20 I love
this this is just a sample that I got in
a 500-point perk from Sephora and when I
finish it I will probably buy the full
size I love it I have my nude it's very
very lightweight it doesn't give much
coverage but it just evens out my skin
tone and it doesn't feel tacky to it
like to the touch it just looks super
fresh and beautiful not to do we but not
matter anything another one that I've
been crazy about this is the bare
minerals complexion rescue this is the
one that I've been using the most out of
all of them to be honest this has SPF 30
so it's perfect to just use on its own
if you don't want to put additional SPF
underneath I have mine in butter cream
0-3 this one is so hydrating it leaves
like a dewy finish but it's it's it's so
comfortably on the skin so moisturizing
I love this one and then this is the one
that I loved last summer and I want to
start using again because I you if
you've been watching my channel forever
like I used to love this I used it all
the time this is the bombs bomb shelter
this is SPF 18 so I would put my SPF 40
underneath this by the way putting on
SPF 40 and then putting on SPF 18
doesn't combine the SPF does it make it
like SPF 58 it just stays like SPF 40 I
love this one it gives me like almost
like a nice tan really weird I have mine
in light/medium and I love the finish of
this this one is a lot more dewy and
like hydrating this one is a little bit
more natural but I just like it because
it has pretty good coverage for a tinted
moisturizer I love that and then if you
want really amazing coverage with
amazing SPF this is probably the best
one out of all of them this is the it
cosmetics CC cream it is a color
correcting full coverage cream with
anti-aging hydrating serum SPF 50 I
love this this has full coverage like
coverage like a full coverage foundation
and it has the highest SPF out of all of
them so I love that it's SPF 50 and it
cosmetics has really good ingredients
it's a bunch of summer products that I
love like bronzers and highlights and
stuff like that but to me these are like
essential things in the summer
so my all-time favorite setting spray in
the summer time is the chill makeup
setting spray and what I mean is
sometimes in the summertime you're going
to go on to a party and it's outside and
it's at nighttime and like the heat is
so intense that your makeup just melt
off your face this is what I love
specifically to keep my makeup in place
in the summer and it really prolongs the
wear of my makeup but it's the chill
version so like when I spray this on my
face it has like a cooling sensation so
I love it I love it it's my favorite one
out of the urban decay setting sprays
the chill one I like the all-night or to
buy like some more okay but on days
where I'm not really wearing makeup and
I just want a little moisture in my face
I really really have been liking this
this is the Mac prep and prime fix plus
this is the coconut scent which I like
it for the summertime because it smells
like coconuts I swear it's like I'm
spring in a pina colada
on my face it's very hydrating very
moisturizing it's nice to just spray
throughout this day but I know that
that's not very practical and actually I
don't know if that's still in stock
anymore I have been loving this and I
know it's super weird and super gimmicky
and like a waste of money but this is
the Evian facial spray this is water
it's water natural mineral water
moisturizes refreshes and tones no it's
just water but I really like this
actually when somewhere not too long ago
where I was dying in the heat I was
outside and this was in my purse because
it's little and in like travel friendly
and I sprayed my face like a million
times that day I wasn't wearing makeup I
was just wearing a little bit mascara
and lip gloss and I was just like Shh
every time I felt like I was gonna pass
out it's honestly just like a hydrating
mist if you're going on a hike
take this we're going on a picnic if
you're going to be in the Sun and like I
really love these little Evian sprays I
would just get water and like
throw it on my face but that would kind
of ruin like makeup or something so it's
nice that this just comes in like a
little spray it's just like you guys
don't know how good this feels in the
scorching Sun when you just pull out on
your person you're like you feel like a
brand new person I swear it I love this
little thing I got mine at Sephora in
the little checkout section okay so I'm
gonna go in to hair products I only have
two hair products to talk about this is
the Sun bum shine on I love this because
it has UV protecting ingredients in it
so your hair gets protected from the Sun
as well the Sun really dries out your
hair and it's just so get a product that
has like UV protection in it this one is
a hair oil of course coconut oil argan
oil almond oil sunflower seed oil and
banana leaf which is awesome coconut oil
that's all really really good for your
hair I have this in the ends of my hair
today just to give it a little bit more
shine because I did apply something that
kind of dries out my hair a little bit
I'll show you in a second say I really
like this one it looks like I barely
touched anything because I just started
using it this summer and I only add a
little bit to the ends of my hair you
could also use this when your hair is
damp like you know it's good it's a
really nice oil it's very hydrating and
also if you want that beachy like yeah
waves my favorite sea salt spray is the
beach bum
I mean the Sun bum to me sea salts off
sea salt sprays dry out my hair because
my hair is really really dry the only
ones that I could deal with or the Sun
bum and the John masters organics one
which I have in my closet I should have
run it out but I purchased this one not
too long ago because I wanted to try
something different besides that John
masters one and this one is really
really nice I think that John masters
one is more expensive so that's why I am
talking about this one this one also has
UV protecting ingredients it has
Hawaiian black lava sea salt sea kelp
and seaweed this I have it like at the
very end of my hair to kind of make it a
little bit more PC because my waves were
just like sticking together so I just
added a little bit of that this is
awesome to put like in a braid or just
like to throw all over your hair like in
the beach it's awesome awesome awesome I
like to combine it with this though
because my hair is so dry that I don't
like using this on its own so spray this
on the ends of
here make it beachy like and then add
the oil to make it a little bit more
shiny because this kind of mattifies
your hair so let's look at those
fragrances really quick this is brand
new
I don't know if you can still get your
hands on it I would try my best go to
every Victoria Secret pink that you know
because it's amazing this is from pink I
just said that this is the beach nights
hair and body mist I look I love this
for my hair I like using products that
are specifically for like hair and body
or just here on my hair because yeah I
don't know this stuff smells so good
like honestly exactly what it said it's
like you're on the beach at nighttime I
like this like bonfire party and you are
the best smelling girl there I really
love this scent and my favorite perfume
in the summertime is this one I've
mentioned it a million and one times
this is the jennifer lopez miami glow
perfume i get mine act perfume mania
bought a new one like a brand new one
and i just started recently using it
because i only wear this in the
summertime like I do not wear this any
of the time not even in the spring like
specifically when summer starts and
summer ends because it's just ridiculous
to wear this like in the winter that's
how much of summer it smells like so the
top notes are passionfruit pink
grapefruit and coconut milk middle notes
are silent climbing I can say that
orange blossom and heylia trope oh my
god I don't know and then the base notes
are amber musk and vanilla so I
definitely smell the fruity coconut
vanilla scent it smells amazing amazing
amazing I highly recommend this for this
time of year go into your local like
perfume a Nia or whatever and smell it
it's good enough J no I don't like any
of the other JLo perfumes though just a
line I do love still still by JLo is
good really quickly I want to mention
three perfumes I love these kinds of
colors in the summer just neon colors
any neon color is an essential for me
but I want to mention these three
because I really
liking this this is one of my favorite
nail polishes of all time and it was
part of a collection but I still see it
at Ulta this is life gave me lemons -
neon greeny yellow it's amazing by OPI
this one is beach cruiser by Orly I get
tons of questions about it whenever I
wear it in videos I love it I love it
and then I love these hot red oranges my
favorite color in the summer and this
one is by Revlon and it is called
provocative it's a good one so yeah
those were my summer Beauty hair all
that essentials for the summer I just
said that I hope this video wasn't
pointless or boring and I hope you guys

recommendations and might try any of
