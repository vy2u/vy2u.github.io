I regret buying video
I like watching these on YouTube just
because everybody's so different and
certain things that people regret buying
other people love so I like watching
these videos so I decided to make one
and I'm just going to go ahead and show
you all the things that I really wish I
didn't spend my money on okay so the
first one is this Neutrogena Naturals
fresh cleansing makeup remover and I
hate this probably more than any of the
things I hate this is how can I describe
this without sounding psycho hell on
earth
what eagle feels like you get me I hate
this I bought this because my sister had
her wedding in Key West so we all drove
down there and I forgot to bring makeup
remover with me so I saw that she had
this on her sink and I used it and I
liked how it took off my makeup so I
bought it and I noticed that this dries
out my skin so bad like how do I say
this when I use this this leaves a film
on my face and I will wash my face I
will rinse it and it leaves a film at
leaves like this nasty residue of like
my skin feels really flaky after I use
this I do have dry skin but I've never
had that experience with any face wash
it just it's so bad and my sister texts
me a couple of days ago actually and she
was like oh my god the Neutrogena
Naturals thing burned my face my face is
like red and I was like yeah that's the
devil I hate that thing the next thing
are two mascaras and first one is the
one wild Myka plump I kind of talked
about this in my drugstore haul I hated
this mascara so much and I really
thought I would love it because what a
wild mega value is my favorite drugstore
mascara of all
time like I feel like it Trump's all the
other drugstore mascara and I love it so
I thought oh my god plump I might like
that since this is also a volumizing
mascara and honestly when I bought it I
had to like dig around the bottle to see
if I could get any product out because I
feel like there was nothing in here was
really weird and it did nothing I felt
like it was just wetting my eyelashes
like if I got some water and just like
you know what my eyelashes that's
exactly what this did horrible
absolutely nothing well the next mascara
is a favorite amongst a lot of people
and it is the Jordana best lash extreme
I'm pretty sure I hate this more than
the mega plump even though the mega
plump did nothing this didn't even try
to lengthen my eyelashes and I know that
it's a volumizing mascara so I mean it's
not supposed to lengthen but a lot of my
mascaras that are volumizing at least
lengthen a little bit this was so bad I
felt like when I put this on my
eyelashes my eyelashes were shorter than
what they were before I put on mascara
and I know that that's obviously not
true but that's how much I feel like
this just oh my god is so bad it clumps
really really bad and I like subtle
clumping I'm a very I'm a subtle clump
or lover okay
I really do I like it but this is so bad
it just like they look like little fat
black sticky short I hate that so much
next on my list is this ponds dry skin
cream and it's rich hydrating skin cream
during the day apply alone or under
makeup apply generously at night
massaging evenly over face and throat
and I thought oh dry skin cream I have
really dry skin I would love this I hate
the way that the smells I'm really weird
about sense I don't like really strong
this reminds me of my mom like I smell
this and I think of my mom my mom used
to wear the this cream at night like it
was like a mask a white face every night
and she couldn't move her face
was like you know I was like one of
those hard masks and it smells so much
like old lady perfume so much I hated
when she would kiss me at night when I
would go to sleep because that smell
just lingered in my mind and in my nose
for so long and it was traumatizing and
that's what I smell but I smell this
soul strong and I can't imagine why
anybody loop with this all over their
face because the smell is so bad not
only that this is so greasy which I know
it's for dry skin so it should be a
little bit greasy but it was like overly
greasy and super nasty my husband used
this and they gave him a lot of pimples
um I don't know if he wanted me to say
that have you used it and it gave him
pimples so I really really don't like
that I'm gonna toss that as soon as I'm
done recording this
the next thing breaks my heart a little
bit because I am a huge MAC lipstick
lover and I kinda regret buying this in
a sense I'd swing this lipstick is
called playing coy and it just looks
like this and in the in the bottle it's
like the cutest color this came out with
a quite cute collection and I bought
every single lipstick with that
collection it was a amazing collection
my favorites and it was really nice and
I saw swatches online and I went I
immediately bought it and then I put it
on at the store and I loved it at the
store but I don't know what's happened
this looks like chalk on my lips
every time I put this on my lips it's a
crazy crazy let me see if okay see like
on my hand it looks so pretty on my lips
it looks like cake like cake lips you
know like those really ugly cakey lips
yeah that's what I get when I get this
when I put this on um statins are my
least favorite MAC lipsticks so I mean I
guess but I have to see if I can at
least make this work like put a lip
gloss over it or put a lip gloss under
it do something
tap it I don't know because I would
really hate to like toss this one you
know what I would just give this to my
if I don't make it work but it sucks the
next thing is this Europeans natural
glow daily moisturizer this is like a
tan like a tanning lotion you put it on
and like oh it gives you like gradual
tan little by little daily and um this
was really good I did like this but it
made me a little bit orange and that's
probably my biggest fear with using a
self tanner is looking orange I that
freaks me out
I'm not like to look orange which I'm
sure no one does but anyway it did make
me a little orange I have to admit I
didn't really like this so what I
realized is if you're light skinned and
you want a self-tan don't get something
that's for light skin get something
that's for dark skin because that tends
to give you like a bronze tan instead of
an orange one this is for fair to medium
skin tones and I think that that's why I
myself I'm getting the one for fair skin
tones this actually really really good I
did like this I just didn't like the
fact that I made the orange so it was a
waste of money because I'm not going to
use this I might pick up the dark skin
one because I hear that that works
better for light skin the next thing I
had mentioned in my Ulta haul and I
mentioned that I hated it immediately
and it's the NYX jumbo lip pencil and
this is an Irish coffee and I had said
that it broke which it did it broke
immediately after I bought it and I was
like that's it that's all the product
you get because the tip just broke off I
honestly thought that that was it
someone commented like sure you can
sharpen that that was like duh of course
you can sharpen this why would it brain
fart Kathleen
get it together so that is not why I
don't like this product it's the super
repulsive smell I can't get over how bad
this smells it smells like waxy like
really waxy cheap makeup and I wouldn't
mind if it smelled like that honestly if
as soon as I put it on my lips the smell
went away like a lot of products you
know like once you put it on your lips
you don't smell it anymore
but this does not do that for example I
hate mint I know that sounds really
weird but I hate anything that's mint
scented mint flavored I hate like I
literally suffer every day when I brush
my teeth I like like suffer
I hate mint and these have a very very
very noticeable minty smell the Revlon
just kissable balm stains they have a
very good light I freaked out when I
bought this and I opened it I was like
oh my god mint but as soon as I put it
on my lips that smell goes away
completely and it doesn't taste like
mint this tastes like wax
like I know that I'm not going to sit
there and try to eat my own lipstick but
it happens you can't control it you
taste some of it and oh my god this
tastes like well like the next thing is
also a favorite amongst a lot of people
I feel like no one dislikes this and
it's the Loreal Elnett satin hairspray
it's like the famous element hairspray
okay I got the little baby at Walgreens
because I rarely ever wear hairspray and
so I figured the little one would last a
long time and it has and unfortunately I
got the one that is scented I should
have bought the one that was unscented
but I didn't realize that when I went to
go pick up I want to go pick this up the
smell is so overpowering and it's not a
bad smell it's just it smells like
regular hairspray but it lingers the
entire day like I would put this I will
just you know hair spray my hair and at
nighttime I still smell like hair I
still smell like hairspray and I feel
like it doesn't really hold see like I
some hairspray on before I've filmed
this because this is the only hairspray
on my head smells like this right now
that's that's all but that's all that
lingers right here this is this
hairspray smell that's all my smell and
I finna get this into a great job at you
know I being the hairspray I'm sorry if
I'm offending anyone I know that a lot
of people love this but I personally
don't I just have one more thing to
share with you guys and it's probably
what breaks my heart the most because I
loved this for so long and it is the Mac
face and body foundation just holding it
breaks my heart
this was my Holy Grail foundation when I
bought it I bought this and I was like
finally I found a foundation that works
for me really what I care about is just
evening out my skin tone and not looking
cakey that's my problem because my skin
is so dry that I look cakey with tinted
moisturizer on like it needs to be a
very thin tinted moisturizer I'm
exaggerating
I could I could get away to the
moisturizer so I really really love this
it just even out my skin tone I gave me
like a nice dewy glow it was amazing
then one day I'm sitting at my mom's
house and my sister is like oh my god
you have a lot of little pimples like on
your forehead I was like I know I have
no idea what the hell I'm getting I
don't know I don't know why I'm getting
that but I didn't know what it was so I
just let it go and I kept I kept using
this and I didn't think that it was this
because I whenever I use this I wash my
face before I go to sleep but I always I
never slept in this so at that time
Danni was coming back from deployment
and I was staying in Miami with my
family while he was on deployment so he
came back I left Miami I came back here
and for a good month I didn't wear
makeup because we were just unpacking
everything and finding a new apartment
and it was just so hectic that literally
all I did for like a month was put on
mascara and my skin completely cleared
up and I was like oh no it was my
foundation and it broke my heart because
I love this
I know Mac fake um I know makeup for
ever makes a face and body so if you
guys have tried it please let me know if
it's good I really really want to try
that out because I love the whole face
and body foundation thing those are all
the products that I regret buying in a
sense I hate that I spent the money on
them because they just didn't work for
me so that's pretty much it I hope you
