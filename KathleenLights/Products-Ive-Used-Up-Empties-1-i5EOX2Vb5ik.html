first empties video or products I've
used up whatever you like to call it and
I'm sure you know what an empties video
is but if you don't basically I just
accumulate a bunch of trash and I go
ahead and show you everything I've used
up and I tell you if I liked it or not
and if I would repurchase it or not oh
yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and get
started I kept everything in this Mac
bag and whenever I would finish
something I would just throw it on in
here
so yeah look get started I finished up
this Aveeno positively nourishing
calming body wash this is the one with
lavender and chamomile and it's supposed
to calm and relax while soothing your
skin I don't know if I feel calm or
relaxed when I use this but I've
repurchased this body wash multiple
times it's one of my favorite I love
Aveeno body washes they are my favorite
body washes and I always go back and
forth between this one and the
pomegranate one that has like the little
beads in it I really love this bought it
a bunch of times I also finished this
dove ultimate visibly smooth deodorant
this is the one in Wild Rose and I
bought it because it had said minimizes
the visual appearance of hair over time
and I don't think that's very true but I
do love dub Durance those are the ones I
get but I didn't like this one in wild
rose I felt like it didn't leave me
smelling um super fresh and clean for
that long I don't know if it's just me
but I prefer my deodorant to smell like
um clean and crisp as opposed to like
vanilla butterscotch caramel sundae kind
of kind of Durin's um and even though
this isn't like sweet or anything I just
I didn't like this scent unfortunately I
feel like I went through a lot of my
perfumes and body sprays all at the same
time it's like they've all finished at
the very same time not all alone but I
have a couple of variances to show you
guys
this one is no surprise I finished a
dark kiss find fragrance mists from Bath
and Body Works this is my favorite body
spray from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it smells
so good I go through a bunch of these
things I actually have another one in my
purse right now it's my all-time
favorite I pretty much used up this one
I have a couple of spritz left but it's
the sexy little things T's from
Victoria's Secret and honest say about
this because it smells identical to be
able to juicy if you know what Viva La
Juicy smells like and you like it then
you definitely would like this and it's
25 bucks um I don't think it lasts as
long as my Bath &amp;amp; Body Works splash and
it's more expensive than this one and it
doesn't last as long but I still would
repurchase it just because I think it
smells really really good it just
doesn't last that long I went through
this perfume right here this is
JLo's miami glow it's my favorite summer
scent in the entire world I'm definitely
going to repurchase this it's not
expensive at all and it smells so good I
love this I don't like any of J Lo's
other perfumes just this one so good
still got some more perfumes to show you
I went through my little baby Viva La
Juicy it's one of my favorite perfumes
unfortunately this scent doesn't last
extremely long on me so I finished that
one this is the one that I would keep in
my purse
I got to get another one I finished up
the versace bright crystal perfume
Danny's mom got this for me
I love spraying this on my clothes
because it just lasts forever on my
clothes this is like my sophisticate
like whenever I want to smell really
fancy this is the one that I spray and I
definitely would repurchase this again
sometime in the future but it's
expensive but I really do got this
finished up my crest 3d white toothpaste
I've bought like sixty thousand tubes of
this it's my favorite toothpaste
honestly we're just using this and the
3d white mouthwash you can really whiten
your teeth a lot this keeps my teeth as
white as they are the best whitening
toothpaste ever I used up the L'Oreal
total repair 5 restoring shampoo and
restoring conditioner these are just
tiny little samples
why is there no Sun why does the Sun
decide to go away when I sit here why it
was 103 degrees today on my way home and
the Sun was like blazing in my car I
come and I sit down and all of a sudden
there's a storm does that make sense to
anybody but the show must go on these
are just tiny little samples this is an
amazing Schieffelin conditioner I will
actually be repurchasing this but I just
bought another shyboy conditioner that
I'm trying out right now but these are
definitely really good and really cheap
I love I love this
I finished my favorite face scrub in the
history of the world and it is the st.
Ives green tea scrub this is the only
thing whenever I break out I use this
and within a couple of days my breakouts
are gone this is honestly what helps my
pimples like when my skin is feeling
crappy this thing is amazed I will
always repurchase this it's pretty cheap
and it does wonders for my skin like you
have no idea so dark I'm sorry it's not
even late can you hear the thunder does
this happen to me why I finished up to
UM makeup remover wipes these are the
Burt's Bees sensitive facing fate let's
try that again
these are the Burt's Bees sensitive
facial cleansing towelettes these are my
favorite makeup remover wipes they are
so gentle on my skin they're not greasy
and they do not burn my face I love
those these on the other hand I don't
know what I was thinking um I got these
at CVS it's called just the basics and I
had never heard of that brand until I
bought these and honestly whenever I
would use this I felt like I was trying
to rip my skin off like that was my goal
not to take off my makeup but to take
off my skin these are the worst makeup
remover wipes I've ever used in the
world oh my god they burned my face it's
not even like my eyes they burned my
whole face terrible terrible I would
never return to this again it's starting
to rain the next product I don't know if
I should show because it's a little bit
TMI whatever why not
I finished the summer's eve morning
paradise cleansing wash this is for your
Pikachu if you know what I mean and
that's all I have to say I think it's a
necessity and yeah I would repurchase
that's all I'm gonna say on that I
finished my beautiful batiste dry
shampoo this is the best dry shampoo in
the world batiste is an amazing choice
shampoo I have the fruity and cheeky
cherry I definitely would repurchase
this scent it smells so good to me and I
really love this and the last four items
are makeup products I finished this elf
cream eyeliner and I didn't so much
finish it up as it got super dry like
this
dried out completely and I tried
everything I googled how to like bring
your gel eyeliner back to life and
honestly it just it was so old it's time
from your throw away I went through this
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion this
is just the mini one this is my favorite
primer that isn't like a base to like
it's my favorite primer that goes on
clear I really love this and then the
last two items are mascaras I finished
the Jordana
slash extreme and I went through this
really quickly this dried out faster
than all my other mascaras that I've
ever used but it was just way too thick
and it just looked so gross
towards the end of it so I'm just
tossing it but I used to hate it I used
to really really hate it and then I let
it dry for about a week um and then I
started to really really like it
super volumizing and it's super cheap
and then I finished my favorite favorite
mascara in the whole world from the
drugstore and it's the what a while mega
Bally mascara still haven't been able to
find it um every time I go to anywhere
where they sell when a while this little
yellow mascara is sold out and I know
that they changed the packaging now it's
like really fat it's like a fat yellow
tube and I hope there and change the
formula because I'll be very upset but
it's so cheap and it's really really
good I love it okay guys so that was my
products I've used up video let me know
