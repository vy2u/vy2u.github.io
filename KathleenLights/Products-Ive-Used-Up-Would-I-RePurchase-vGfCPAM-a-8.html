a products I have used that video I
don't film these often because honestly
I don't go through the products as fast
as other people do I don't know why
actually I do know why I have like
commitment issues to certain products
and takes me longer to finish up a
product than it would normally but I
also don't like to use products up so
fast because I try to like prolong them
as much as I can people get really
excited to go through products and I
don't it upsets me to finish stuff so
yeah let's just go ahead and get into it
I kind of feel like a lot of this stuff
is a little bit boring and not very fun
I love seeing people go through makeup
but I don't go through makeup like
hardly ever I finished a bottle of
loving tan de luxe bronzing mousse this
is my favorite tanning product
ever ever ever I like mine in ultra dark
it says it has a natural olive color and
I totally agree
I don't have it on my body right now of
course as you can tell but I love it I
get super tan when I use this and it's
nice to have some color in my skin I
love that one I went through a whole
16-ounce
shower gel of the L'Occitane or is this
called the L'Occitane almond shower oil
this is basically like a body wash and
if you're wondering why it's in this
little thing but on the L'Occitane
website they sell these 16-ounce pouches
for cheaper so I bought the original
like 16 ounce tub you guys have seen it
I feel like mentioned it before and -
offensive that is super pricey stuff but
if you buy the refill pouches these come
out to cheaper so I just buy the refill
pouch and then dump it into my normal
tub and yeah I save some money that way
so this is my favorite shower gel in the
entire world it's the most moisturizing
and the best smelling I love it so I do
pay the money even though it is
expensive but I save somebody want to
use this so yes I went through here we
fill I went through two of the Paul
Mitchel aqua pookie aa Polly wild ginger
Moisture lather shampoo
I still haven't gone through the
conditioner and which is so weird
because everybody finishes conditioner
faster than shampoo but I love using
deep like conditioning masks in place of
conditioner a lot of the time so that is
why I've gone through two shampoos and
not a conditioner yet because I use
different conditioners on my hair every
time I wash it so I loved it it was so
flea free I really liked how it like
tingles on my scalp it smelled really
really good
but I have converted to pure ology and
honestly I have never used a shampoo and
conditioner better in my life than pure
ology so I will continue to use pure
ology this was good but nowhere near as
good as pure ology this oh I still have
stuff I just don't have some more what
I'm use it but I'm almost done with the
oil free eye makeup remover from
Neutrogena effective and gentle gentle I
really really like this but if I did get
it in my eye I kind of went blind for a
little bit because it is like that
oiliness it says it has no oily residue
but I don't know this is my favorite
oil-based I makeup remover though so
yeah this was really good but I wouldn't
exactly repurchase it because I found I
like other makeup remover better but I
really did like this while I was using
it I'm still gonna finish it though
can't believe there was some left oh I
went through a little travel size of the
locks a ton almond shower oil I like to
buy these little ones these are like
eight dollars I believe I like buying
the little ones from Sephora because I
use them to travel all the time I love
it this is the st. Ives a blemish
control green tea scrub gently clears
breakouts and calms redness that they
change the packaging now and I have a
feeling they changed the formula because
I don't feel like it's the same anymore
this used to be my Holy Grail
nothing ever compared to this my
favourite facial scrub ever like the
green tea was very calming on my redness
but I feel like they when once they
change the packaging they kind of change
the formula because the one I have now
is it as good as this one was and I've
gone through tons and tons of these but
I'm not going to repurchase it anymore
cuz I feel like it's not the same
comment down below if you agree
this is the Redken extreme strength
builder plus this is a hair mask and
while it was really good and smells
amazing um I have found the living proof
hair mask nothing makes my hair as soft
as the living proof one living proof one
I can't speak today I used to love the
Carol's Daughter one Carol's Daughter
yeah but after I found the living proof
one oh that is the best hair mask for me
so I loved it while I used it but I will
not repurchase because I found something
better I went through this little guy
this is the derma e microdermabrasion
scrub it smells like lemons I got this
in an Ipsy bag and it was a good scrub
but that was really strong lemon said it
was a good scrub but it was a little bit
too abrasive for me these days I like a
more gentle exfoliator or a chemical one
so I will not buy this this is the
smaller version and I buy the little
ones all the time this is the fresh soy
face cleanser for all skin types I love
this is my favorite morning face wash it
smells of cucumbers and it just wakes up
my skin and it's so gentle on my
sensitive skin that I highly highly
highly recommend the this I highly
highly highly recommend it I have
purchased multiple multiple multiple
times one of my favorite cleanser by far
picking up cleansers I finished a purity
made simple one-step facial cleanser by
philosophy this is my favorite makeup
removing cleanser so I use this one at
nighttime especially when I have makeup
on my face as this cleanser removes
makeup better than any cleanser I have
ever used but at the same time it
doesn't dry out my skin it doesn't
really foam up I hate foamy cleansers
it's kind of like a milky texture that
really really really deep cleanse but
Deek live deep cleans but doesn't strip
my skin so I love purity I have a giant
tub in my bath so I have repurchased it
I love it this is the ocean salt face
and body scrub by lush I found that I
went through this so fast and I liked it
but I do not love it I found that it
kind of dried out my skin a little bit
I have typically like really dry skin
and I found that
this kind of read it out I think it's
because it's a salt scrub and I prefer
sugar scrubs are a little bit more
hydrating but I don't know it's it was
really nice it smelled like a tropical
escape but it did dry on my skin a
little bit so because of that I will not
go out and buy it
a scrub that I did finish and did love I
love these these are this is the tree
hut Shea sugar body scrub and I have
mine in coconut lime these are so
inexpensive they're like seven dollars
and they are amazing very hydrating and
there's so many scrubs in there that
they really really really exfoliate your
body really well it gets on my dead skin
off I love this especially before um
self-tanning cuz this just like takes
all my dead skin I love me some tree
hood so goo I did repurchase if you're
wondering and right now I'm using the
Brazilian nut
it smells like coffee this is bio derma
I finished an entire thing of Bioderma
this is the big one I have another one
right here waiting for me to go through
I freaking love this this is the best
thing in the entire world my dogs have
the best like my seller I don't say the
word the best micellar water I have ever
used I recently purchased a simple one
and I know I don't think it compares to
this one this one I can get right up in
my eye like I could remove eye makeup so
easily which is why I probably won't
repurchase this but I can remove my eye
makeup without any problems I get right
up in there and it does not sting or
burn my eyes it takes off all my makeup
all of it amazingly it's my favorite
makeup remover and it doesn't strip my
skin you don't have to rinse it off
because it just feels like you're taking
your makeup off with water it's magical
I don't know what's in this it's like a
potion of mystery is the best makeup
remover ever I love it and now you can
get it on beauty Liscomb which I'm
really excited for us Americans I love
it this is a really sad product to go
through this is a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
fragrance mist in this in the shade
today's not a good day to film in the
scent dark kiss this is my favorite Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works spray of all time
year-round it's my favorite but they
discontinued it but for a while I was
able to buy it online like they didn't
sell it in stores anymore but they sold
it online but now I can't even
find it online anymore they stuff like
the lotion which I don't like I don't
like Bath and Body Works lotions but
they still have that but they don't have
the mist anymore and I don't know why
why would they do that to me why why
would you do it to me Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is my favorite and now I only have
one left
okay so went through to Bioderma
sensitive skin wipes and while Bioderma
is like the best thing that ever
happened to me I don't really love these
I love the simple ones more these were a
little bit dry like it was like a dry
cloth I like something a little bit more
wet not as wet as the Neutrogena ones I
really don't like the Neutrogena wipes
but I don't know this is a batiste dry
shampoo dry shampoo oh my goodness and
dry shampoo in floral and flirty blush
this one smells like roses kind of I
love batiste dry shampoo because it's
affordable and it really really sucks up
all sucks up it's not I guess at 6 it
really sucks up all the oils and can
make you go on like another day without
washing your hair love batiste dry
shampoo is good this is a Beauty Blender
weight a blender cleanser solid buy
Beauty Blender I go through these like
water this is completely empty I don't
know what I go through these like water
this cleans my Beauty Blender and my
brushes like nothing else and it's so
easy to just swirl my brush in there and
it deep cleans my brushes but it doesn't
dry them out I love this I have
repurchased this is the origins high
potency NightA means mineral enriched
renewal cream this is my holy grail
cream I've been using it for like two
years already or one and a half years I
will not use any other nighttime
moisturizer this is the best nighttime
moisturizer I have I've used I see a
difference overnight like my skin looks
more plump more hydrated just smoother I
love this I swear by this I highly
recommend it maybe if you have normal to
dry skin because it's very hydrating
like a very hydrating overnight cream
okay and the rest kind of are makeup
related products nothing not skin care
hair care anymore so I'm just going to
toss this because ice
a lot of product would have had this
forever this is the lorac bronzer in the
shade bronze it's kind of like a reddish
bronzer I got this in a Christmas
collection like three years ago three or
more three years ago four years ago I
don't know
and while I used it and I liked it as
you can see a hit major pan it's just
kind of old and songs gonna get rid of
it two sample mascaras and they were
amazing this is the better than sex
mascara it's one of my favorite mascaras
of all time I love it I have since then
gotten another one and then this is the
Tarte gifted mascara which now that I'm
looking at it I remember loving this
mascara so I might go out and purchase
it but I have so many mascaras open
right now that it would be a crime to do
so but the gifted one was amazing if you
really like volume it's very similar to
this but not as clumpy this one does
give you volume but isn't I was like
flaky is this even though it sounds bad
I still love this but you know this was
the Tarte no this was the Terina
Tarantino mascara and I liked it while I
used it but the brush was so big that I
would end up getting mascara on my
eyelids a lot of the time so I won't go
out and buy this I got this in a boxy
charm and it was great to high-end
mascara it's awesome but the brush was
just too big that mama had some trouble
you know but it was nice this is the
matte I'm just showing you mascaras I
went through the Mac and extreme
dimension 3d black lash while my
favorite mascaras ever gives me a ton of
volume and I have repurchase that I have
one in my makeup right now just ready to
open this is the Maybelline rocket
volume Express I loved it while I used
it but I found that I liked the presents
where is it what is it what is it I like
the Maybelline lash sensational more now
they have like the exact same packaging
pretty much but I love the lash
sensational a lot more than this one the
lash sensational gives me more volume
and it makes my eyes like my eyelashes
look bigger and lasts longer I would
most likely purchase that one over this
one then I have the Jordana best lash
extreme I will always repurchase this
it's like a $2.00 mascara and it gives a
ton of volume can be a little clumpy if
you're not careful but it gives so much
volume I love it
a dramatic mascara that's so cheap it's
so good oh this is kind of skincare this
is the tarte maracuja see brightening
eye treatment this is kind of like a
sample and I used it up just to use it
up but I have discovered the best
under-eye cream ever you guys know if
you saw my skincare video
it's the Kiehl's midnight recovery eye
nothing will ever compare to that I saw
results within a week so this is like
garbage next to that I will not go out
and buy that again oh I went through
another Messier I didn't see that okay
this is the Revlon bold lacquer mascara
I got this in a boxy charm I loved it I
loved it while I used it Porter's
barking stop it I love this mascara um
but yeah I mean I love others more but
this was really good to me I like it I
would I would potentially repurchase but
there's that I wanted like more and that
Maybelline one I like more so know I
went through an honest hacia broadway's
honestly I've got through like a million
of these since my last products have
used that video I used mine in dark
brown formerly known as brunette
this is the best brow Wiz ever in the
world
two liquid liners this is the makeup
forever graphic liner I love this but I
felt like it dry it out really really
fast like faster than my Jessie's Girl
one or my Kat Von D one so I don't know
I would definitely repurchase this I got
this in like a Christian gray collection
thing I would repurchase it cuz it was
so black and so matte but it right up
like kind of fast and I love the tip
it's kind of like a felt tip but it was
easy to use and then I went through the
NYC liquid liner this is my Holy Grail
liquid liner and it's like two dollars
very matte very black but it is a brush
tip good stuff I went through a whole
chapstick which is kind of exciting
because I never go through chapstick I
never I don't think I've ever bombed to
a chopstick so this is like a monumental
moment this is the cake batter chapstick
by the regular chapstick brand and I
loved the scent I was always like huh
sorry I liked it it was good I death I
definitely would repurchase if I saw it
I went through the Revlon Colorstay
foundation this is in
250 fresh beige this is my tanning shade
like my summer color I have the one for
normal to dry skin because the regular
colors day is super drying this was one
of my favorite drugstore foundations to
date I have repurchased this since I ran
out because it's one of the best
drugstore foundations in my opinion very
full coverage and lasts all day and then
the rest are like nail polish have like
three nail polishes well one is not a
nail polish it's a base coat this is the
Revlon Colorstay base coat this was my
favorite base coat of all time like Holy
Grail I didn't find any I still haven't
found anything that compares to this but
of course Revlon went and discontinued
it so yeah the base coat and the top
coat were my favorite but Revlon
discontinued it great thanks Revlon you
always do that to me well not really but
thanks anyway
and then I went through two nail
polishes this doesn't really happen to
me very often but when I use the nail
polish so much that I eventually have to
throw it away because it's so goopy and
nasty that's kind of exciting sort of
this is the Sally Hansen extreme wear
nail polish in mint sorbet my favorite
minty green nail polish ever and it's so
cheap I loved it and then this is the
Sally Hansen complete salon manicure in
pink slip these complete salon manicure
nail polishes lasts forever on my nails
it doesn't chip like they're there for
like a whole week it's amazing and I
really loved pink slip it was like the
perfect like a bride color like on every
day like pinky white loved it okay so
that was it that's pretty much all the
things I've used up recently I hope you
