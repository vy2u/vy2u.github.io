half-ass empties video I was noticing a
lot of you guys kept requesting that I
would do empties like every two months a
lot of you were asking me to do it every
month but I guess I just don't go
through products that often I don't have
enough to do it every month but I guess
I could accumulate things every two
months and then I'll do empties videos
more often and also let me know if you
want me to add other things in Landy's
videos to like not just beauties like
today I have a candle that for some
reason I really want to talk about but
let me know if you one of the other
things I candles or maybe like specific
foods I really liked that I finished I
don't know just let me know in the
comments if you want it to be like
beauty and other things as well excuse
my hair by the way it's so funny I
didn't try at all I just picked up my
hair and like a tiny little man bun back
here and I was like that looks good and
every time I do my hair like this I
think of my mom because whenever I wear
like a ponytail in a video or a top not
like a bun whenever I pick up my hair is
in some way my mom is always like you
never brush your bumpy's I just like to
leave my hair pretty wild like this I
really I don't even bother with my hair
like this little bald spot right here
like this would drive my mother crazy
you know my mama she is judas Geller
only in a much much nicer way but I'll
be like oh why aren't you wearing
earrings maybe it's a Cuban thing or
like a Hispanic mom thing always make
you feel like you should I hate let say
a little bit more but anyway I don't
know what that has to do with this video
but I just wanted to tell you that story
okay let's talk about the products that
you Joe I actually have a few perfumes
to talk about today because I went
through a couple I want to go so I love
buying these small perfumes like the
smaller versions the 1.7 ounces versus
the big bottles because I feel like
since I am such a perfume hoarder I have
a ton of perfumes most of them are in
the big bottles like my signature scents
I get them in the big bottles but
perfume does go bad it does last a long
time like I have perfumes here that I've
had for years and they still smell good
for example pink sugar from aqua Lena it
expires so fast if I don't use that
bottle up within a year it's
starts to smell a little weird and it
turns like a weird yellow color I love
buying smaller bottles they're better to
travel with and I'm able to go through a
perfume a little bit quicker and I don't
feel like I'm wasting my money but I
just I love buying smaller bottles
anyway longest in driver this is the
Jessica Simpson signature perfume I
believe it's called signature and I
really love how this smells I will leave
all the notes of all these perfumes here
on the screen because I know describing
a scent it's pretty pointless but this
one is delicious
it smells very sweet without being too
sweet it almost has like a fresh kick to
it it's like fresh and sweet which is
kind of like my favorite combo I love it
cuz you smell clean but you smell
delicious too
I don't know if this is discontinued or
if it's not being sold anymore I'm not
sure but even if it is I am personally
not repurchasing this because it just
doesn't last on the skin I find this to
be the case with a lot of celebrity
perfumes they just don't last and this
except my Miami glow by j.lo that one
that forever and this one even though it
smells freakin amazing it just doesn't
last on my skin so I don't think I would
repurchase this so two sprays Ariel
so Versace has these really cute little
purse praised for their bright crystal
perfume I love these I wish every brand
came out with a little a little purse
spray so they're so convenient they're
tiny and they do last a pretty good time
at least this perfume does I love this
perfume it lasts forever on my skin and
every time I wear it I get a ton of
compliments which to me is like the best
thing ever when someone tells you you
smell good and this is such a good
perfume I love it I would totally
repurchase and I already did I have like
to at least another program I'm
completely obsessed with and it was
living in my purse as well both of these
they were roommates this is Lido Malone
nectarine blossom and honey this is so
amazing I kind of don't know which one I
love more I don't know if I love
blackberry and BAE more or if I love
this one but there are the only two
scents from Jo Malone that I truly love
and this one lasts a really long time on
my body like a really long time I think
even more than blackberry and BAE and it
smells so clean and fresh and you smell
so fancy and
and I loved it such a good way I love
these little bottles too that's
expensive but I think it is worth it
because of the lasting power and then
last but not least I went through one of
these guys this is a chanel Coco
Mademoiselle and I buy these little
refill things they're like little purse
sprays as well you get these at Sephora
and then you just buy the refills and
it's a zipper if you might always take
with me when I go to LA it like reminds
me of LA and I love how it's very sturdy
like the glasses inside is not going to
break you can throw this and you'll be
good and out of the five billion
perfumes that I own this one is one of
the most long wearing I will smell this
the next day on my skin it is so potent
Chanel perfumes are pricey but I
personally think it's worth it because
it just lasts so long okay so now that
we're done talking about perfumes I was
on that topic for like a good five hours
we can move on now I finished this hair
mask this is from the brand maroa I
really like this brand and this is their
deep moisture hair mask it's paraben
free Valley satelite free strengthens
resource and repairs all hair types it's
an intense conditioning treatment and I
really really liked it I do have other
deep hair masks that I like a little bit
more like my hands-down my favorite hair
mask is from living proof and I really
like the Rio geo one this one was great
but I do like those a little bit more so
I don't see myself repurchasing this but
it was very conditioning very hydrating
it left my hair with a nice silky feel
so yeah I like it I like it but I do
have others I like more sure how many of
these do I go through in a week these
are the co gentle cleansing spa water
wipes not going to talk about these too
long because I talk about them in every
empties video these are my favorite
wipes from Sephora like they're my
favorite high-end wipes I don't think
anything can percentage they don't feel
greasy but they're very saturated like
they're wet very wet which I love it
takes us all my makeup with one little
wipe it's amazing and it's great for
sensitive skin it doesn't strip this
it's just perfect it's perfect but if
you're looking for a really good ones at
the drugstore the president company
views be simple my seller
amazing whites are my favorite they are
gold alone
another Bioderma I go through Bioderma
like I drink it
Saiga drink this this is my favorite
micellar water I have tried a brand
after brand drugstore high end to me
nothing compares to Bioderma it's the
only one that doesn't sting my eyes I
can like get up in there with a cotton
round and no singing plus it removes my
makeup so perfectly I just love this to
me nothing compares I'm almost out of
another one it's just it's so good lived
on my desk I went through a foundation
primer how shocking is this I've just
used up this like two nights ago when I
was like ah I could put this in my empty
bag this is the Laura Mercier foundation
primer in radiance I've had it blah I
guess I had a little bit more that's a
lot more in a lot of friends of
difference I could have sworn I squeezed
every bit out okay so there was a few
more drops in this but honestly not
enough to where I would keep it around
I've had this for years already super
expired
it has 12 months mmm I had this were
like 48 months this is one of my
favorite radiance primers on the market
it makes your skin so glowy but at the
same time it actually hydrates some
radiance primers will give you the
radiance like it'll give you the do but
it won't give you the moisture it will
give you the hydration and it's like why
do I want that I don't want to just look
dewy I want to feel hydrated so that's
why I love this primer I have loved it
for years I stopped using it on my
channel for a while there for a long
time because I'm always trying new stuff
you know I get into the habit of using
other primers and you know you know how
this makeup world is on YouTube but I
was still using this all the time off
camera and I would always take this with
me to travel I just came back from LA
and I used it I used my new one though I
have a brand new two that I just got so
of course I would repurchase because I
did talk about this candle okay because
I purchased this on the North strim
website and I had amazing reviews
amazing this is the macaroon I know it's
how you say that word it's like macaron
now I don't know room I don't know I I
butcher that but this is like the
macaroon candle and I really wanted to
get this because okay I use a lot of
bath and body
candles and I don't think I will ever
stop but I was trying to get into a more
natural candle like something made out
of soy but that it was still going to
give a nice throw to the room and this
one is made out of coconut wax which is
awesome it is a hand poured a luxury
candle and this does smell really good
but it doesn't smell good enough like it
I don't really smell it when I walk into
a room and my beauty room is not that
big and I would walk in and it wouldn't
really smell it and this wasn't cheap I
mean don't get me wrong I paid more for
candles this was sixteen dollars but I
wait for the bath and Bodyworks handles
to go on sale which is still priced
because it's like twelve dollars each
it's only a few dollars more so I'm
being dramatic but it doesn't have a
straw I don't really smell it that much
so it to me it's too pricey for what you
get and I in fact it has great reviews
but I don't think it's not good okay so
I went through a formula X delete all
five fingernail polish remover I love
this thing it comes in this tub and then
it has five holes and you put your
fingers in there and that's how you take
a while your nail polish I don't love
the formula it is pretty drying when I'm
done taking off my nail polish the skin
around my nails looks kind of crusty so
I don't love that but I only use this
when I'm in a hurry it's just so fast
and easy I mean I already purchased
another one so of course I would
repurchase I think it's amazing it is a
little drying but especially when you
have like glitter or like something or
red that red takes forever to remove I
do I loved it it just deletes all
instantly all I do it I cuticle oil a
little lotion this is the body shop
almond milk and honey calming and caring
shower cream it's for dry sensitive skin
when I saw that I was like oh I want
that I love anything that has almond in
it I love honey I was all over this and
call me shower cream I love anything
calming seriously I was so excited to
get this but I didn't like this I mean I
know I used the whole thing because I
paid for it so I wanted to use it but I
loved my locks a ton almond shower oil
way more I know it's way pricier but my
skin feels so soft when I use it like so
soft my knife smell good it's just so
amazing and this one fell short for me I
didn't feel like it was really cleaning
my body and I have dry skin I need
something that's really
nourishing and this one just a little
fun for me I don't think it's bad I
really liked the scent but I just it's
alright
something I already repurchase this is
the fresh soy face cleanser it's for all
skin types I have been using this face
wash for years now and it's amazing I go
back and forth between this and other
face washes but this is like my
tried-and-true it's so gentle on the
skin I love using this in the morning
because it smells like cucumbers and it
just wakes me up I really love the scent
I love how it feels it's perfect for
sensitive skin it's fragrance free and
I've just been using this for ever and I
love getting the little ball I know they
have a big one I feel like same thing
with perfumes I feel like getting the
big bottle like it gets kind of goopy
towards the end and I rather just buy
like these smaller versions okay so it
has two mascaras to talk about one I
finished like three months ago but I
haven't thrown it in my empties bag and
then this one I just threw it demand
feedback today because I use it on my
lashes today and I was like you know
what you are done you know when you're
getting to the bottom of the mascara and
it's like dry it out and it's not
performing the same yeah it happened
today this is the trish mcevoy high
Volume Mascara in jet black it is my
favorite tubing mascara hands-down it's
the only tool in mascara that actually
gives me insane volume eyes lashes it's
the best and I love that it's a tubing
mascara because it's so easy to remove
whenever I'm like you know what I need
to wear mascara but I want to be able to
take it off really easily like if I'm
filming a video but I want to take my
makeup off like immediately after like
today actually came back from LA and I
haven't seen Amelia since I was in LA so
she came over and filming this video but
as soon as and gentlement take up on my
makeup I'm going to go hang out with
Amelia so I want to put on mascara that
I could just remove and this is so easy
to take off with just a little bit of
warm water it just tubes right off but
two major downsides to this mascara it
is very pricey it's trish mcevoy so it's
a high-end mascara and it doesn't last
long at all I go through these so fast
they get clumpy and dry pretty quickly
which is a major bummer because it's so
pricey
for me it's definitely a hundred percent
worth it just because it's so like
hassle free so major cons but major plus
is with this guy I love it
I went through another Beautyblender
solid cleanser this is what I use to
clean all of my beauty blenders all of
my makeup sponges and all of my makeup
brushes as well nothing cleans my
brushes like this it gets out all the
foundation it leaves them spotless I
might have to do it two times but it
does leave them squalus I love it I
don't see myself ever using anything
else to clean my brushes like til the
end of time I went through another
makeup brush cleaner by cinema secrets
this stuff is so good if you're in a
rush or you really hate to wash your
makeup brushes so you kind of want to
give it like a quick wash in between
washes you grab your dirty brush spray
there's nothing in here but you spray it
on your brush rub it into a towel and it
makes your brush instantly clean and
instantly dry as well so you clean the
brush and right on the spot and you can
use it this stuff is so good at how you
recommend it and it leaves your brushes
smelling like vanilla kind of a strong
chemical even illah but after a few
minutes it does fade and then it leaves
your brushes with like a delicious scent
highly recommend knees I always get
these little bottles because they're
just easy a spray versus that giant tub
something I didn't I didn't love so much
I mean I still have a bunch of this in
here and I'm just getting rid of it I
did not like this this is from the brand
Ren clean skincare and I like this brand
a lot they have amazing products amazing
products but this is the robust NT folia
gentle exfoliating cleanser and this was
okay it was just way too gentle I don't
see myself for purchasing this when we
said in fact that I didn't even finish
it because I honestly saw no result I
mean I like gentle exfoliator 's I have
sensitive skin so I would like something
gentle but I think this was just like
too gentle
my face looks exactly the same after I
use this and I thought maybe if I use it
more like maybe you see results over
time but I used this for like an entire
month and I didn't see a difference have
other exfoliator that are like way more
than that and then last but not least I
went through another benefit precisely
my eyebrow pencil
I love these brow pencils so I love
these and I love Anastacio as well well
I love these oh oh I don't know what
that was
but I love these and I love the Anasazi
ones as well I also really like the Dior
one that one's a little pricier but this
one I'm the Anasazi one have got to be
like my ride or dies they're so so good
oh there's one more thing in here I went
through an SCE tow companion lash glue
it looks like I have a ton of product in
there but it is so thick and goopy like
I can't even use it anymore
yeah it's like disgusting and I did like
this lash glue I like that you can brush
it on but I do like the house of lashes
one more I just even though it's
beautiful it is beautiful I do like it
it's good I would definitely recommend
it but I do think the house of lashes
one is better but yeah guys that
completes this video these were all the
products I went through and like the
past two months I thought this video was
going to be quick but momma talks too
much
