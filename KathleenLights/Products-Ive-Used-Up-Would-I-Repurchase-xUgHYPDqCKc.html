a empties video
I've been collecting my trash for a
while my beauty trash beauty products
I've used up and I've been clipping them
into this bag so that I could sit down
and share them with you guys and tell
you guys okay use this product up what I
repurchase it or not was it good or not
and yeah we discuss I love watching
videos like this I don't know if this
video is boring I don't do it very often
because okay one I always forget to put
it in this bag and nine times out of ten
I throw away the product I use up which
I need to learn how to not do that the
thing is that I keep this bag in my
bathroom and most of the stuff I used up
as in my Beauty room here so whenever I
use something up most of the time I'll
just throw it in the garbage
I really won't even think about it but
then there'll be moments from like oh
man I forgot to put that in my bag
sometimes I feel like people think these
videos are boring I never know if people
like them so let me know if you like
these and yeah let's just get started
let's talk about products I've used up
okay so I'm gonna get these makeup wipes
out of the way there's so many so many
that I actually kept in this bag cuz I
got I went through a lot more than this
these are the morphe makeup removing
wipes this one is in a cucumber and this
one is in green tea I like the cucumber
one but I wouldn't purchase them they're
not my favorite wipes I think they're
like they're okay I mean they're nice
this one smells really good you're gonna
have to purchase these online and I
think that they're just better ones so
you could just buy in store so these are
not my absolute favorites
they were good though I mean they
removed my makeup I didn't get any
irritation or anything there's okay I
went through about a trillion of these
simple micellar makeup removing wipes
these are my favorite wipes at the
drugstore I love them way more than
their original simple wipes
I like the micellar ones they just
seemed to be a little bit more hydrating
and it just felt like I was taking my
makeup off with water honestly I love
these so much they get everything off of
your face all your makeup but it doesn't
leave a weird film on the skin it
doesn't strip your skin or anything I
wouldn't say I'm picky when it comes to
wipes but there are a lot of wipes at
the drugstore I don't like I don't like
any of the Neutrogena ones they feel so
oily and they just leave a weird residue
on my face and some of those irritate my
skin actually some of them break me out
I have zero irritation with these
they're the best if you haven't
my seller ones buy these cuz they're
really good I also went through a pixie
moisturizing cleansing cloths I really
like the packaging on this I like the
fact that it's one of these that you
could just close the ones like the
simple ones where it's just a sticker
sometimes a sticker will lose its head
he save and it'll like come up and some
of the wipes will dry out that doesn't
happen too often most of times I'll just
store my simple ones upside down so that
the sticker doesn't come off fun little
tip but I like the packaging on this one
I love wipes like this these were okay
it has aloe vera which you know I love
and has a lot of really good ingredients
camellia oil and argan oil it's very
soothing and really good for the skin
but I personally like wipes to remove my
makeup and these didn't remove my makeup
it doesn't claim to be a makeup remover
wipe so for that reason I don't think
it's a bad product so I don't even think
that's what it's for and I just ended up
using these to remove swatches you guys
know I do a lot of swatching that's what
I like them for so if I ever do pick
these up that's what I'll buy them for
and then the last wipe I have to talk
about are the cleansing spa waters by
Cochin go these are my favorite high-end
makeup remover wipes I think I spoke
about this in my last empties so I don't
want to go into too much detail
I always repurchase these even though
these are very pricey that's expensive
for a makeup remover wipe but let me
tell you but I love these the wipes are
very very big and they're like very
saturated with water not oily or sticky
or gross they really do feel like water
similar to the simple ones but even more
saturated with the water and they remove
everything and I only need to use one
wipe with these most of the times with
the simple ones I end up using two one
to remove all of my eye makeup and then
want to do my face but this does both so
I really really love these speaking of
cousre dos pao water I also went through
a coach endo cleansing spa water like
not the wipe the actual water I
purchased this because I love the wipe
so much and I wanted to see how this
compared to my Bioderma I keep my
Bioderma on my vanity at all times it's
my favorite micellar water in my opinion
nothing compares I have tried every
micellar water at the drugstore and I
don't like any of them the way I love
Bioderma I don't know why it's just
Bioderma doesn't sting my eyes and a lot
of other mice
the waters sting my eyes I don't know
anyway so I really wanted to try this
out and I loved it I think it's
extremely similar to Bioderma he removed
all of my makeup it felt like water just
like Bioderma does but will I repurchase
this most likely no because it's the
exact same thing as Bioderma like I said
and this is pricier so I would just
continue to purchase Bioderma cos it's
it's my favorite let's talk about a few
mascaras I don't want to talk about all
the mascaras all at once so let's talk
about three this is the flower beauty
zooming ultimate mascara I really
enjoyed this it has a wand that twists
and you can see it go from like big to
small when you twist it so when it's
larger it's really nice for lengthening
but when you twist it it's really nice
for volumizing so I really enjoyed it
for that I felt like this mascara dried
up really quickly though I feel like I
haven't had it for that long and it
dried up on me pretty quickly but while
I was using it I thought it was really
really good it's not my favorite mascara
at the drugstore but I like it and I
really like the packaging it's rose gold
I like it this is the Clinique lash
doubling mascara a part of me just wants
to continue to repurchase this mascara
over and over and over again and I mean
I continue to do that over and over and
over again if you've been following me
since like the very beginning I'm
talking like the very beginning when I
just got this vanity I made a video
comparing this mascara to like a
drugstore one for years and years
this was my ultimate favorite mascara
I've been using this one not this exact
bottle but I've been using this mascara
since I was 15 years old and it was
always my holy ground Here I am
ten years later ten years later and I
still really really love it but it is no
longer my favorite mascara I do think I
have mascaras in my collection that are
a little bit more volumizing and a
little bit more intense I like to use
this one now more as like an everyday
kind of mascara and yeah to me it's it's
one of the best though it's not my
favorite anymore but it's definitely one
of the bests next up is the essence
forbidden volume false lash mascara top
coat I didn't like this I didn't like
this at all actually I feel like it
didn't really volume eyes my lashes it
made them look kind of short there
wasn't there was
like nothing to this I much prefer other
mascaras from essence they have pretty
good mascaras considering they're very
very affordable but this one no I don't
like I went through another one of my
favorite hair masks I'm not sure if I
talked about this in my last empties
video maybe it's my favorite hair mask
so I go through these this is the living
proof restore mask treatment for dry or
damaged hair I spoken about this on my
channel before but when I was living in
Mississippi I had light brown hair and I
wanted my hair even lighter so I went to
someone without doing my research and
she really effed up my hair she kind of
made it darker and when I was supposed
to be lighter and then when she tried to
fix it she put like so much bleach I
don't know my hair was falling off and
like certain section it was a mess so I
had been googling and I was really
looking into products to restore my
damaged hair and I came across this hair
mask and I've loved it ever since this
is such a moisturizing such a hydrating
hair mask every time I use this and I
run my fingers through my hair when I
get out of the shower my hair just feels
so incredibly soft revitalized dry or
damaged hair due to coloring chemical
processing and heat styling all the
things I do I still dye my hair I only
dye my roots which I got a tie my roots
but I get a lot of questions by the way
of what color I dye my hair because my
hair is normally like a really dark
brown and I use a hair dye by the Brad
matrix and I use matrix eight and a this
stuff has really helped my hair I use it
all the time I go through these so often
it's truly the best and it's also
silicone free which is amazing I went
through a perfume which looking at it
now there's like a little bit of left in
there let me oh my god am I crazy it
looks like there's still some juiciness
in there but it's not coming out this is
the Donna perfume by the brand Valentino
I purchased this before I went on my
trip to Vegas the first time I had ever
gone to Vegas around May of last year
and I fell in love with this I heard
that girl Shay talked about it in a
video and when I saw it at Nordstrom I
think this is a Nordstrom exclusive when
I saw I smelled it and I fell in love
immediately it's so unique to me I don't
know how to explain it it's sweet you
guys know I like sweet scents but it's
not like sickly sweet not overly sweet
there's like a little hint of powder
enos to it and I like powder
just never mind know right it's really
good and it's very sexy
I'm just so welcoming when I wore this I
wore it all throughout Vegas and I got
asked all the time what perfume I was
wearing it stays on your body for a long
time at least on me it does and I
already repurchase it so of course I
would I already did I have gone through
about a hundred of these this is the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana black dry
shampoo there's only one in this bag but
I went through way more than this this
is the best this is my favorite dry
shampoo hands-down I've spoken about it
100 times on my channel so I don't want
to talk about it too long but it just
soaks up all the oils I don't wash my
hair every day so I really rely on this
to keep my hair fresh and clean looking
and it makes my hair look fresh like if
I just washed it and it smells really
great so your hair smells really great
which is a win-win
I'm telling you it's the best it's pricy
it's pricey but in my opinion it really
is worth the money I've gone through a
bunch of these Beauty Blender solid
cleansers this is the only thing I use
to clean my brushes and my Beauty
Blender when it comes to a deep clean
this is all I use it just washes it so
well and it's so easy you unscrew the
top you rub your brush in there and then
I rub it on my brush egg it's just this
little thing with a bunch of ridges and
it just cleans my brushes so well it
takes out all the foundation all the
stuff like all of it just pours out of
it and it cleans my Beauty Blender but
like amazingly well I love this little
soap I went through a NYX angel veil
skin perfecting primer I've never gone
through a full primer before I don't
think this looks full but II santhi he's
empty I love this I think it is
hands-down my favorite primer at the
drugstore it just reminds me so much of
the hourglass mineral veil primer and
it's like a fraction of the cost which
blows my mind it's so good it's just as
good as the hourglass one it really does
a good job of just smoothing out the
skin I just love the consistency and how
well my foundation lays on top of it so
it's really really awesome seriously a
great primer from the drugstore check it
out it's amazing let's do the rest of
these mascaras I have two of the Kiko
extra sculpt Volume Mascara this has
replaced my Clinique mascara this is my
favorite mascara hands-down it's still
volumizing and lengthen
I have a whole video on how to get false
looking lashes with your natural lashes
and this is the mascara I used in that
video I love it I love it I love it I
saw my friend Laura Laura if you're
watching this I know you don't like this
you mentioned this in your flops okay
and I do not appreciate it it's not a
flop I know everybody likes different
mascaras but for me personally this just
made my eyelashes so volumizing and
crazy and I love them and of course I
would repurchase cuz I already have time
and time again the Jordana best lash
extreme volumizing mascara is really
nice if you want to spend very little
and get a lot of volume it's like a
$2.00 mascara but it makes your lashes
look super volume eyes it can get
borderline clumpy like it can look a
little too spidery if you're not careful
but with a light hand to even coats and
you get wow lashes for such a low cost
so I love that this however it's not
cheap this is the Kevin akan the expert
mascara and this is good I liked it but
I didn't love it I don't think it's
worth the money I think my Kiko one is
better and yeah it was average I mean it
was nice no get me wrong I loved it
while I used it but what I run out and
buy it right now no the bumble and
bumble bee bee hairdressers invisible
oil sulfate free shampoo I purchased
this because I heard Casey Holmes raving
about this and she was right I think
it's amazing it really does clean my
hair like it gives it a deep clean but
it doesn't strip my hair and it doesn't
make my hair feel super dry which I hate
shampoos that just make my hair feel
like hmm this doesn't do that it has six
feather light oils to help soften the
silk in tame defriend detangle and
protect and I feel like it does all that
I love this shampoo what I repurchase
yes I'm going to repurchase the next
time they mean so Florida because it's
really good I went through a bottle of
the make up forever mist and fix setting
spray I really like this to me this is
kind of like a fix plus replacement I
would use it for pigments or to just
freshen up the skin I would use it on my
Beauty Blender all the time it's not
something I like to set my makeup with
for that I definitely love my Milani one
more but I still think it's nice and
whatever you purchased this yes I like
it more than I like fix+ so I would
totally repurchases I think
another model in my backup drawer that
I'm gonna pull out cuz yeah I like the
cinema secrets makeup brush cleaner is
amazing I love buying these tiny ones
because they have the little well that
one got stuck that's never happened to
me with any of the other ones I've
purchased better like this I love these
little spray ones because I just spray
it on my brush wipe the brush on a paper
towel and it just cleans at my brushes
so well I don't recommend only using
this I do give them a deep clean with my
Beauty Blender solid but whenever I use
a really colorful eyeshadow or I use too
much bronzer or whatever the case may be
if I want to take off a lot of the
powder product that's on my brush I will
spray it with this guy rub it on a towel
and it's like clean good as new and it
doesn't leave your brush wet so you can
just spray this on your brush clean it
and your brush is completely dry and it
has a really nice vanilla scent so I
love these cinema secrets makeup brush
cleaner of course I would repurchase I
went through quite a few quite a few I
don't know where the top of this one is
but I went there quite a few of the
Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliners these are
my favorite eyeliners that are
affordable it's like five dollars for
these I buy them off of the Jessie's
Girl website because I no longer have a
writing near me it is a complete dupe
for the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper seriously they're like the exact
same eyeliner so I highly highly
recommend Oh hated these I highly
recommend you checking these out it's so
matte and it's so black I love it and I
also have a Kat Von D liner in trooper
as well I also love this I think they're
both good
I do continue to repurchase this one I
don't know why because the Jessie's Girl
one is just as good I don't know what my
deal is
but I love them both the same I went
through eight NARS Laguna bronzer yes
there's still a bunch of product here
but honestly this had fallen to the
floor and it has shattered and it just
it got to the point where I just
couldn't use this anymore I did have a
huge pan I had more product than this
but it was a huge dent and one day I
want to go use it and it shattered and
then this was it was left with this and
I just went ahead and purchased another
Laguna because I feel like I can't
really get my brush in there as much as
I as I want to I love this bronzer it's
so good it has a little bit of a sheen
to it so it's perfect to bronze the skin
but the color
it makes it okay to contour your face as
well it's not too orange it doesn't look
muddy it's just an overall really great
bronzer and I think it looks amazing on
so many different skin tones it's like a
holy girl for real I love it and then
the last product I want to talk about is
the benefit precisely my brow pencil I
have mine in the shade number three I
think this is my favorite brow pencil
ever when benefit did their whole brow
review I was really into the goof proof
one which is the one that's like
triangular I was using that one for a
really long time I thought that one was
my favorite but then I started to use
this one and I think I liked it more
it's a little bit more precise hence the
name and I feel like it just fills in my
brows really well I love the color I
think the color is perfect and I just I
really like this brow product is it
really good it's really really good and
yes I already repurchased well that one
was sent to me I bought it so yeah that
completes this video these were products
that I recently used up leave me a
comment down below for any future
