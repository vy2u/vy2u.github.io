a prom tutorial and I know that a couple
of you guys have already had your prom
and I'm so sorry I'm super late but I
know some of you haven't had your prom
so better late than never hopefully so
yeah let's get started I'm going to be
using my Too Faced shadow insurance to
prime my eyes this one keeps my
eyeshadow on for a really long time so
it's pretty crucial for prom I'm going
to add a base so that my eyeshadows can
stand out a little bit more and I'm
using the Milani shadow eyes in golden
bronze I'm going to go into this
eyeshadow from Mac called Naked Lunch
and a flat shader brush I'm going to
apply this to my entire lid I'm a little
sick guys a summer little recipe I'm
going to take some tape and then apply
that to the sides of my eye to create a
nice cat eye effect and then I'm going
to go into Mac's soft brown and I'm
going to buff this into my crease and
just working that color back and forth
then I'm going to go into the shade
called copperplate this is also from Mac
and I'm going to be doing the exact same
thing
I actually like how these two colors
look together there's something about
the cool tone and the warm tones that I
think look really nicely paired together
then taking a dark chocolatey shade this
is brown down from Mac I'm just going to
build this color slowly onto my outer-v
and just drag it into my crease and a
little bit on my lid as well this eye
look does take a lot of blending so you
just want to go back and forth with the
eyeshadow just apply a little by little
and not get too heavy-handed with it
then I'm going to take this pigment from
makeup geek it is called afterglow and
it is absolutely amazing and on a flat
shader brush I'm going to apply this on
to the center of my lid dragging it
towards my inner tear-duct then I'm just
going to take any matte black eyeshadow
and I'm going to be doing the exact same
thing I did with the chocolate brown
color only focusing the black a little
bit more towards the tape and not so
much on my entire eye if that makes any
sense just dragging that a little bit
into my crease but focusing most of the
black color right at the tape so that it
does have a nice transition I'm going to
take this gel eyeliner from maybelline
and this one lasts a really long time on
my eyelid that's why it would be perfect
for prom and then I'm just going to add
a thin line I don't want anything too
thick so that it doesn't overpower my
entire eye and don't worry about a
perfect little wing because the tape
does act as a perfect little guide so
that you don't mess up then I'm just
going to go back into the black
eyeshadow and just intensify the black a
little bit more packing most of the
black like I said towards the tape then
I'm just going to take the tape off and
then I'm going to go into Mac's shroom
and I'm going to use this as my inner
corner highlight
for underneath my brow bone I am just
taking a random white matte eyeshadow
and applying this underneath my brow
bone I'm going to be doing my eyebrows
next and I like priming my eyebrows with
eyeshadow primer when I want them to
last all day which is what you would
want for prom I have an entire eyebrow
tutorial that I will link down below if
you are interested because this would
take way too much time I'm going to move
on to the rest of my face and Prime with
my Maybelline Baby skin applying it on
the places where I think I needed the
most I'm going to take a photo friendly
foundation mine is the Urban Decay Naked
skin this has no SPF so it looks amazing
in pictures which is ideal for a prom
and I'm just going to buff this all over
my face using a real techniques buffing
brush
next I'm going to conceal my under eyes
and I recommend using a full-coverage
long-lasting concealer mine would be the
Mac Pro Longwear it lasts literally all
day and it is full coverage but when I
went to go film this tutorial it was
nowhere to be found so I'm just using
the maybelline fitme concealer just for
the sake of this video but i definitely
recommend one that will last all night
long and it is pretty good coverage and
my pro longwear is perfect for that but
this will do for the sake of this video
and I'm just buffing that out with the
Real Techniques contour brush
I'm gonna set everything on my face
using Mack MSF natural in the shade
medium I love this powder because it is
very finely milled and it does not look
cakey on the skin whatsoever so you're
not going to look like you have a lot of
powder on your face and to set my under
eye concealer I'm using this powder
called emphasize it's also from Mac I'm
sorry and I'm using like a lot of Mac in
this video I don't know I didn't even
realize it while I was filming but I'm
just gonna set my under eye concealer
with this powder then to finish off my
eyes I'm going to take a q-tip and run
that on my waterline just to take out
any of the excess oils and the pencil
that I'm using right here will last a
lot longer I am using my chela ivory
lace highlighter this is just going to
open up the eyes so your eyes don't look
really really small or harsh which is
what putting black on your waterline
tends to do then I'm just gonna take
that brown color and apply it to my
lower lash line and then with a pencil
brush I am just going to buff it all out
so it looks nice and smoky I'm going to
use my clinic bottom lash mascara this
makes my bottom lashes look nice and
dramatic which is what I want for prom
and then I'm going to be adding ball C's
next so I'm just going to apply a very
thin coat of mascara using the
Maybelline rocket volume Express the
falsies I'm using are the our gel
natural demi whispies these are my
favourite ones even though I have not a
false lash where were you guys know this
but those are my favourite ones when I
do wear false lashes
I'm going to take my benefit hoola
bronzer and my Sigma contour brush and
I'm just going to contour my cheekbones
with this bronzer i definitely recommend
contouring for prom especially because
it just gives shape and dimension to
your face and it looks nicer in photos
too so i'm just going to contour my
cheekbones temples my forehead a little
bit on the sides of my nose and then i'm
going to take my NARS Laguna bronzer and
on a bigger brush and I'm just gonna
bronze up my face a little bit more just
to give more color to my face
then I'm going to take that onto my
chest as well just to look a little bit
more bronze than glowy the blush I'm
using is this one by NYX and it is
called mauve and I love this blush I
think it complements so many different
eye looks and I'm going to be applying
that with my it cosmetics blush brush
the highlight I'm using is this one by
elf and it is called blush gems and I'm
just gonna add this to the tops of my
cheekbones and on the bridge of my nose
sorry and on my Cupid's bow a little bit
I'm gonna do a new lip but I'm going to
do a more brownie darker nude lip this
is what a while bear it all and I'm
going to do a darker nude because very
pale nudes tend to look white in flash
photography so you don't want to look
like you have ghost lips at prom and
then I'm just going to take my buxom
White Russian lip gloss and apply this
on top I love this lip gloss because it
lasts a really really long time on my
lips and it does give off a beautiful
glossy finish so it is perfect for prom
that completes this makeup tutorial I
