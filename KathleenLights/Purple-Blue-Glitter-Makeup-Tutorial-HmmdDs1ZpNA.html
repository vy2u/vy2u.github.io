tutorial on the look I'm wearing I know
I had a similar look in my last makeup
tutorial I mean I used completely
different colors but it was also kind of
like a halo eye the technique was
similar so I apologize for that but it
is a completely completely different
look and I know that Halloween tutorials
are like all the rage right now
everybody's posting Halloween videos and
I never do Halloween tutorials just
because I'm not that talented we have
some crazy talent here on YouTube but I
I just stick to the makeup so I wanted
to do something that was more out of the
box for me more colorful it kind of
reminds me of like a mermaid or like
intergalactic like a space like a galaxy
outer space kind of thing anyway I hope
you forgive me because I'm using a ton
of different eyeshadows for this look I
didn't have just like one palette that I
could use for all of this I dipped into
some makeup geek eyeshadows and I used
quite a few our shows from the Sephora
Pro palette this is the editorial one I
used a few shades in this and just like
other shades I'm sorry it's all over the
place but just use any eyeshadows you
have at home that are similar to these
shades and you'll be good to go yes
anyway if you guys want to see how to
get this look then just keep watching
okay so eyes are already primed and
ready to go and the first eyeshadow I'm
gonna take is the makeup geek shadow in
the shade cupcake I'm using this as my
transition shade just buffing this
pretty heavily in the crease
now I'm gonna take the Milani shadow
eyes 12-hour wear eye shadow thingy in
the shade black ink and I'm gonna use
this as a base for the navy blue eye
shadow I'm gonna put down so I'm just
buffing this onto the lid and not taking
it past my crease okay so now I'm going
into a more vibrant purple this is
carnival also by makeup geek and I am
just buffing this in the crease to add
some more purple there's gonna be a lot
of a lot of crease work in this look so
for the navy blue I'm taking this
Natasha Dona v pen eyeshadow palette
this one is the number one and I'm
taking the shade Navy and I am applying
this to my entire lid this is like the
most amazing navy blue eyeshadow so I
just had to dip into this palette and
then I'm gonna take a deeper purple for
my crease just to blend out the harsh
edges and this is the morphe single
shadow in the shade grape day and this
is just gonna help help I said that
weird I'm gonna help blend everything
out okay so I'm popping into the sand
for a pro editorial palette and I'm
gonna take this like burnt reddish pink
color and I'm just applying this into my
crease with a smaller brush just to
really focus it like directly in the
crease I don't really want it to go too
far past it and then I'm gonna take a
lighter pink to help blend that out I
took some more of the gray day I shadow
and I'm just blending some more lots of
blending as usual going back into that
navy blue I'm just gonna reinstall off
and here I'm just blending some more
funds more with that great day get it in
on that great day okay
back into the editorial palette I'm
gonna take the white shade it is very
very white but it'll do so I use that as
my brow bone highlight and then I took
that light pink shade again and I am
just lightly dusting that into my crease
just for a light wash of color now I'm
gonna apply this Stila liquid eyeshadow
to the very center of my lid kind of
like a halo effect and I'm using a
little brush is just like blend out the
edges this does dry really fast so you
have no time to do that by the way I
used the shade into the blue it's a
really pretty like blue glittery shade
and then I took makeup geek Pegasus
eyeshadow just to apply on top and blend
everything out so it doesn't look too
harsh and then I just went around it
with the navy blue shade I'm going in
with the black in the editorial palette
and I am just applying a little bit of
this to the outer corners just to deepen
up the outer corners and here I'm just
blending as usual so I wanted some more
pizzazz and I feel like adding the
Pegasus eyeshadow kind of dulled it a
bit so I just applied some more of that
into the blue glitter just to intensify
it a little bit and then I just cleaned
up my under-eye area and moved on to the
face before I finish up the eyes for
primer I'm using the Smashbox primer
Iser I have been loving it it's so good
for my dry skin and for foundation I
went in with the Maybelline matte and
poreless
for concealer I gotta use my
tried-and-true you know heart-shaped
tape in the shade like neutral and I am
just applying this under my eyes you
don't have to use a lot of this
concealer by the way just like one
little swipe will be enough coverage it
is very very high coverage so they'll
use too much
to set my under eye concealer I'm using
the Wet n Wild photo focused pressed
powder in the shade warm light I love
this powder it's very smooth almost
creamy feeling it just looks really nice
on top of foundation I'm kind of
applying this everywhere a little bit so
to finish off the eyes I'm going in with
carnival eyeshadow by makeup geek again
and I'm just buffing this on my lower
lash line now I'm going in with a black
eyeliner this one is from Make Up For
Ever and I'm applying this to my tight
line and to my waterline as well going
back into that navy blue shade on a tiny
tiny tiny little pencil brush I am
buffing this really really close to my
lash line even closer then I put the
carnival shade I don't want to bring it
too far down and then just to further
blend everything I'm applying some more
of that carnival shade right underneath
the navy blue so everything is nice and
matchy-matchy now I'm going back into
the black in the Sephora palette and I'm
using a tiny little brush to help
connect this to the upper part of my lid
you kind of see I'm kind of like
applying it to the outer part of my
lower lash line and connecting it to the
top part if that makes sense but you see
what I'm doing and then I just took this
like iridescent purpley pink shade as my
inner corner highlight and to make the
look even more glittery I went in with
the Urban Decay heavy metal liner in
distortion and I just applied some on
top of that Stella glitter and then I
went in with some falsies the Ardell 113
and I applied some mascara as well this
is the wet and wild mega length and then
we are done with the eyes so to finish
off the face I'm going in with my
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and
I'm contouring and warming up the skin
with this product
going in with my essence satin touch
blush in the shade satin love i'm
applying this to my cheeks i love this
blush i use it all the time and it's so
cheap it's good stuff for highlight i'm
going in with my flower highlighting
palette this one is called this shimmer
and strobe highlighting palette and I'm
using the like champagne cream color but
I'm also mixing it in with the golden
shade I really like the combo of those
two this is a very intense highlighting
palette I love it and then I went in
with the morphe setting spray just to
melt everything together so to
officially finish the look I'm going in
with my lip color this is the Catrice
ultimate stay lip liner in rosy Brown
and then I'm just popping a gloss on top
this is the Marc Jacobs skin deep and
Namur lip gloss and that completes this
