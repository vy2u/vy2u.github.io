hey guys today's video is a makeup
tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
here this is using the Anastasia I keep
saying Anastasia and I'm trying to teach
myself to say Anastasia artist palette
this just recently came out I purchased
mine at Ulta calm I don't know if
they're still in stock or not but I'm
pretty sure I purchased it like the day
or than the day after I came out I
wanted to buy it because I have so many
neutral palettes and this one just
looked different to me because they do
have other neutral colors thrown in the
mix this is actually a really really
easy like ridiculous like ridiculously
easy makeup tutorial which is okay right
because it's like one shadow kind of and
I feel like there's so many tutorials
out there that it's like route that are
really hard to recreate and I feel like
this is pretty easy to recreate I know
it's a little bit out there because it
has like that super bold yellow under
eye and in person it's a lot more
intense like I didn't think this yellow
color would be as intense as it is which
I'm glad it is because it's really
pigmented and I really like it so far
so yeah I like this palette I give it a
big thumbs up and if you want to see how
to give these luke I did my whole face
but if you want to get this look then
just keep watching I'm gonna prime my
eyelids with Mac's painterly paint-pot
it is my all-time favorite you guys know
I'm going to take the artist shallot
what the artist palette and the shadow
called buttery it's a creamy matte
vanilla shade and I'm gonna set that
Paint Pot with that shadow I'm gonna
take dusty rose it's a beautiful dusty
rose color a little bit mathy it's
seriously stunning one of my favorites
in this palette and it blends like a
dream and I'm going to apply that in
windshield wiper motions into my crease
using a big fluffy blending brush this
matte purple color is called aubergine
and it's really really pigmented but you
do have to kind of like work in little
sections so I'm using this on a flat
shader brush and
I'm just packing that onto my eyelid and
that's going on my entire lid but I'm
not going to take it past the crease
with a smaller fluffy brush really
similar to the Mac 217 this one's just
from Sophie I'm gonna go back into that
dusty rose shade and then I'm going to
blend out the harsh lines that the
aubergine shade kind of made if that
makes sense now I'm going back into that
flat shader brush and I'm doing the
whole thing all over again because a lot
of the color does get blended away once
you start blending in the crease so I'm
just doing it all over again and then
taking a little bit more of the dusty
rose and just blowing out the look I
want it to be really smoky in the crease
and kind of fade nicely I'm going to
take a small little brush and add the
buttery shade underneath my brow bone to
kind of lift the brow a little bit so
I'm going to start on my face I was like
crying because I was watching The Voice
which constantly makes me cry but anyway
I am taking the makeup forever hydrating
primer and I'm applying that to my
entire face and then I'm gonna mix both
of the Maybelline matte and poreless and
the original fit me
the original fit me is a lot more dewy
and a matte and poreless is obviously
not and poreless they're both from the
fit me line but I find that combining
both of them together I get such a
natural beautiful finish and I'm using
an elf stippling brush to apply that or
concealer I'm using my Mac Pro Longwear
and I'm taking this on like a pointy
little brush from Sedona lace and then
this I'm what I'm going to drag it
across my eye to kind of sharpen the
makeup the eye makeup as you just saw if
that makes sense so yeah covering my
dark circles and then cleaning
everything up with this concealer as
well and I'm also highlighting a little
bit more with my Maybelline Dream Lumi
magic Lumi
dream Lumi touch highlighting concealer
in ivory so i am adding some more
underneath my eyes and then highlighting
other parts of my face with this
concealer as well and then I'm just
going to blend that all in using that
same brush I used to blend out or to
apply my Mac concealer I feel like I
cannot speak today I don't know what's
wrong with me
so I'm going to take my favorite product
ever this is the Too Faced cocoa contour
kit and I'm going to take this morphe
blush brush and I'm going to dip it into
the shade like cocoa and this is going
to set my concealer and bring a lot of
light underneath my eyes it's a
beautiful like matte but kind of glowy
highlighting powder I love it
so yeah I'm gonna finish off my eyes
before I go on to the rest of my face
I'm gonna take this color called brush
it's a very vibrant matte bright yellow
and on a sigma pencil brush i'm going to
apply that underneath my lower lash line
i'm going to drag it down pretty far as
you can see on my other eye and yeah so
i'm also going to bring that into my
cheer just as well and i'm gonna be very
very messy with this i'm going to apply
that sucker all over my lower lashes and
i'm going to extend it to where the
purple is as well i'm going to take this
buttery shade again buttery yeah buttery
shade again and on that same pencil
brush I'm just going to go over my inner
tear ducts because I don't want it stark
yellow on the inner corners just like a
light yellow this is the NYC liquid
eyeliner my favorite
it's nice black and matte as I love it
and I'm just gonna do a typical wing and
of course I can never catch that on
camera so yeah just do the wing like I
normally do I added some false lashes
and I'm using the Loreal telescopic
mascara on my lower lashes not too much
because I don't want to take away from
the yellow under-eye but that pretty
much completes the eye makeup now I'm
going to contour using the medium cocoa
powder in this contouring kit this one
is like a very cool toned Brown so it's
perfect for contouring
I'm using that on a brush that my friend
got in her FC bag um and gave it to me
so yeah I'm using that to contour I love
this for contouring it's the perfect
undertone seriously beautiful and it
smells like cocoa so you know I like
heat
so yeah just contouring my face like I
normally would let sides of my nose and
my jawline and all that stuff
and now I just want to warm up my cheeks
a little bit so I'm taking a fluffier
brush this is from zoeva and I'm dipping
it into the medium cocoa shade in the
kit it's a lot warmer as you can see
there was something on that brush I
don't know what that was but it's warmer
so it gives a nice warmth to the skin
it's nice I love it like I loved it so
much the only thing I don't like about
the contouring kit is that shimmery
highlight I don't like it at all it's
like glittery weird so to highlight my
cheekbones I'm using this elf Sunkist
bronzer in the shade of Sunkist you
can't tell on camera but it gives the
most beautiful golden glow and it's two
dollars I love it now I'm going to line
up my lips using the Too Faced perfect
lips lip liner in the shade perfect nude
I love this lip liner it's like my
favorite I've talked about it plenty of
times yeah I'm just gonna over draw my
lips just a tiny bit it's not too crazy
but yeah I'm going to do that and then
just fill them in and then I'm going to
go over it with a lipstick this is
Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick in the
shade of pink Cognito it's a nice shiny
lipstick I love it and then that
completes this makeup look I really hope
