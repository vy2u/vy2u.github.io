question and answer video I posted a
video sometime last week asking you guys
to ask me some questions and a bunch of
you guys did which thank you so much I
mainly wanted to do this video because
there's a lot of questions that I get
over and over again and instead of just
answering everyone over and over again I
decided to just put my frequently asked
questions in a video so yeah this video
is probably going to be extremely long
so I'm just going to go ahead and jump
into it because there's a bunch of
questions I'm going to be answering
these questions kind of categorize like
um okay how do I explain this kind of
like about me and my background and
personal things then stuff about Danny
there was a bunch of questions about
Danny and then kind of like makeup and
random towards the end if that makes any
sense at all
by the way if your question didn't get
answered in this video I'm really really
sorry I mainly wanted to do the
questions that got asked multiple times
but if your question didn't get answered
in this video leave it down below and
then I'll answer through the comments so
yeah let's get started
I get this question asked so much in my
videos
everyone comments like oh my god you
have a husband I thought you were 12
but I'm 21 years old even though I don't
look it it used to really bother me when
people were like um you look five years
old but it doesn't bother me anymore the
way I see it is when I'm thirty I look
25 right I am Cuban American both of my
parents were born in Cuba my mom came
when she was 15 and I think my dad was 9
when he came and I was born here so yes
I'm an American but I'm Hispanic this
one is so funny to me because I don't
hear an accent when I speak but
apparently everybody else does
I call it my Miami accent everyone
speaks like this in Miami because 90% of
the population in Miami is Hispanic so
we have this Miami accent I guess that's
the only way I can describe it because I
mean I was born in the United States so
I don't have a Cuban accent at least I
don't think it's just everyone speaks
like this in Miami and I grew up in
Miami so I called it my Miami exit
my birthday is January 27th 1992 which
makes me an Aquarius and honestly I'm
not really big into horoscopes but every
time I read like what the personality
traits of an Aquarius I am nothing like
my zodiac sign like absolutely nothing
I'm nothing like the Aquarius I don't
know religion is kind of a touchy
subject for a lot of people but I
definitely do consider myself religious
I used to go to church every single
Sunday with my mom back in Miami I
haven't gone to church since I moved
which I feel so terrible about but I
just really loved my church back home
but I pray every single day I feel like
I cannot go on with my day unless I pray
it's a very big deal to me prayer is
really important to me so I would
consider myself you know somewhat
religious
yes I do have siblings I have two
brothers and one sister but I am the
only child from my parents before my dad
got with my mom he had my brother Danny
and then before my mom got with my dad
she had my sister
Alette and my brother Johnny I am
extremely close to my sister I do not
consider her my half-sister I don't
consider any of my siblings like my half
brother or my half sister I they're my
brothers and sisters I don't I don't
believe in that half stuff me and my
sister get pretty upset when people say
that we are half sisters it really
bothers us so yeah those are my siblings
my favorite book is definitely hands
down love monkey it's so witty and
sarcastic and smart and amazing I love
that book so much I definitely recommend
it if you're wanting to read like a
smart and witty kind of book but I
really do love and in the French kiss
that comes close in second it's such a
feel-good book and it makes me so happy
and um that one kind of targets more to
a little bit of a younger audience than
love monkey does so if you're in your
teens and you want a really good book to
me I definitely recommend Anna in the
French kiss it is so cute like it's the
cutest little love story I've ever read
in my life
my favorite TV show of all time is
friends I own every season honestly in
my opinion there isn't a show that even
comes close to friends the cast and the
writing like I could sit here and talk
about it for hours it means so much to
me it's the greatest show I've ever seen
and besides friends my two other
favorite comedies are the office and How
I Met Your Mother
but when it comes to drama I don't think
any show beats Dexter it's it's so
amazing I've been watching that show
since like 2007 and it just finished
unfortunately and it's so I can't I
can't even describe it Dexter is amazing
so the face he's making and then of
course I'm currently obsessed with a
bunch of different shows True Blood the
Vampire Diaries revenge
Once Upon a Time Hawaii five-o The
Walking Dead a lot i watch a lot of TV
this one is really hard because I'm
afraid of everything
um and I mean drowning is a really big
fear of mine and being set on fire but I
think that 90% of the world is afraid of
drowning being set on fire but I know
this is gonna sound really weird but one
of my craziest fears is finger
amputation okay I know it sounds weird
but just like the thought of getting my
fingers cut off scares the absolute crap
out of me okay like a movie that
traumatized me to my very core was House
of Wax if you guys have ever seen it the
girl like puts your hand she's like
underground and puts your hand through
like the sewer somebody comes and cuts
her finger off I had nightmares for four
years okay I cannot watch that movie
ever again finger amputation is one of
my biggest fears in the world I hope I
pray to God that none of my fingers ever
get caught
definitely animal abuse I am really
really sensitive when it comes to
animals and whenever I see like these
innocent animals being mistreated it
kills me inside I saw a video the other
day of this guy hurting his dog he was
like beating his dog the dog was like
crying hysterically and he was laughing
the entire time and I cried watching
that video and I honestly think that if
a person is mistreating an animal they
can't that's not a very good person at
all pit bull fights really really get to
me just animal cruelty in general is
just something that destroys me my
favorite music artist is hands-down John
Mayer I have been obsessed with John
Mayer for years and I've been to one of
his concerts best night of my life I
have a quote from the song gravity
tattooed on my foot that's how much I
love Don Mayer I don't know I love all
John Mayer songs I can't say I have a
favorite song I can't begin I have seven
tattoos they're all pretty small but I
have seven of them and if I were to show
you all of them and the meaning behind
them and all that stuff this video would
go on for hours so I'm not going to get
into that if you want me to do a
piercings and tattoos video sure that's
it
okay I'm gonna try to breathe through
this answer before things get awkward or
weird but it's a tie between my parents
divorce and my dad's accident um
actually the hardest thing I ever had to
go through was 2011 the year 2011
because um my parents got divorced and
my dad got into a motorcycle accident
all in the same year and they were both
extremely hard to deal with I kind of
suffered differently with both of them
but they're probably the hardest things
I've ever had to go through my parents
got divorced when I was 18 years old so
it was really really hard for me to
accept I know that they say that when
you're older is a lot easier because you
understand things you know as opposed to
you being a little kid but I don't see
it that way personally I mean for 18
years it was me my mom and my dad and
then all of a sudden it'll all just kind
of changed and it was really hard to
come to terms with that like seeing my
parents separated because there was
something I was just not used to and
then a few months later my dad got into
a motorcycle accident and almost lost
his life he had a traumatic brain injury
and it was just the hardest time of my
entire life it was so hard to see my dad
suffer as much as he did um because my
dad has always been like very strong his
whole life so seeing my dad like go
through those things was so hard for me
it was just a really hard experience and
Danny was on deployment so I just felt
even worse because I felt like I didn't
have someone there for me
throughout this entire experience I mean
I had the support of my family but I I
really I felt alone most of
time but um my dad is doing good now I'm
glad that he's alive that's what matters
to me is the fact that he's alive I'm in
a good place right now and that's all
that matters
I work at the exchange on base um as
many of you know Danny is in the Navy
and I work at a store on base it's
pretty much like a place that sells
makeup and clothes and electronics and a
bunch of stuff um on base like I've said
ten times but I work in the electronics
department all the way in the back and
yeah that's where I work and work at the
exchange
me and Danny met through my best friend
Amelia I've been friends with Amelia
since I was like 12 and Danny is her
older brother so I've had a crush on
Danny since I was like 14 that's funny
but yeah we met through I mean ooh I get
this one a lot as well Danny is 29 and I
turned 22 in January he is seven years
and a couple of months older than me and
everyone loves to crack jokes and talk
about how he's old but honestly if you
hung out with Danny for an entire day
you wouldn't never think he's 29
he plays xbox all day first of all and
he is just a big kid like when I'm
around him I am laughing the entire time
and he just is like always cracking
jokes like no one makes me laugh like
Danny and I swear I feel I don't I don't
see his age when I'm with him I really
really don't I don't even know how to
explain it
I mean honestly at the end of the day
people are gonna say whatever they want
to say but it's just seven years and I
don't even feel them
we do on kids eventually but it's
something that we're not ready for right
now I'm gonna be 22 so I mean that's
still pretty young I'm still still
learning how to take care of myself um
I'm a very fidgety and paranoid and
extremely paranoid person so I feel like
I have to mentally prepare myself before
I become a mother because um it's just I
feel like I feel like I would just move
my mind to be completely honest but I
hope there's kids in my future I really
do it's not for everyone I will say it
really isn't for everyone I personally
love it I'm so grateful for the Navy I
really am I've always been someone who
really loved the military
I could never it for something in my
eyes I could never be in the military I
want to last a day in the military um
which makes me appreciate it even more
because I have so much respect for the
men and women who are out you know
fighting for this country and just I
just I have a lot of respect for the
military and the Navy has really made
Danny a better person and it's just I
love I love being a military wife I
really really do
those are the hard parts you know
deployments they're never easy being
married to Danny I've already been
through two deployments it was not easy
I had a really difficult time with them
and Danny really is my rock and his kind
of Danny as well helped me get through
things because he is very he's very he
has a very strong character and he gets
things done and it's you know he's he
that's just how he is and I'm nothing
like that I don't have a strong
character at all I'm very mellow
I'm never mad like I'm just you know
this is the kind of person that I am
like this that's me sometimes when I
feel like I'm kind of stuck in life like
the person who helped me get through
those things is Danny
so deployments are really hard you do
feel lonely all the time but I will tell
you this those are the hardest goodbyes
they are the best hellos in the world
amazing amazing it almost makes the
months without them worth it just
honestly I had been wanting to do
YouTube videos for such a long time um
that was my pastime in high school all I
did was watch YouTube videos it was like
a constant thing that's that's all I did
and I was just so fascinated I like the
YouTube world I don't know so I mean I
guess YouTube inspired me to start
YouTube because I just loved kind of
like the YouTube beauty community and I
wanted to be part of it
that would be amazing but I have to be
realistic and say that
might not happen my goal isn't to be
like extremely popular like I didn't
start making videos to think oh I'm
going to become really popular and it's
gonna be my career in Volvo I just I
wanted it to be like a hobby of mine I
wanted to I really enjoy makeup and
talking to people and stuff like that so
that's why I started doing videos if it
ever became my career that would be
amazing and I would appreciate that so
very much but I mean it might not happen
so right now I'm just going with the
flow that's all I can say I have a Canon
t4i I was heavily into photography
before I started making YouTube videos
which is why I have this camera and the
editing software i use is imovie I used
to use Windows Movie Maker and then I
got a MacBook and now I use iMovie but
yeah I get this question a lot
um this vanity I didn't buy anywhere
Dani built this for me he is a builder
for the military he is heavily into
building he did that before he got in
the Navy like that's that's his life
building and I drew on a paper what I
wanted my desk to look like and he
brought it to life it's I love it it's
beautiful to me um he got the mirror at
Home Depot was just like a mirror by
itself and put it into this thing we got
the light bulbs at home people as well I
wanted it to look like very vanity girl
style but if you know that vanity girl
mirror is like $700 or something
extremely crazy like that so that's why
he built it himself I love it um but
yeah
I actually got this question a lot
surprisingly um my favorite makeup brand
would have to be urban decay
I feel like urban decay can do no wrong
like their entire naked line is heaven
like I don't even explain it like I love
urban decay so much it's just a little
expensive you know so I mostly have Mac
though that's probably the most makeup I
have but yeah okay guys that was it
