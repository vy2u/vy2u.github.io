for back-to-school hairstyles that are
extremely easy to do and it takes about
five minutes to do them and I don't know
about you guys but I had to wake up
everyday at 6 o'clock in the morning to
get to school on time and honestly the
last thing I wanted to do is sit there
with a curling iron and do all of these
hairstyles that would take a lot of time
because that meant that I had to wake up
even earlier to do them which is the
good thing about these hairstyles
because they're cute and they take
minutes to do some of these hairstyles
I'm sure you've seen in other tutorials
before I'm not sure some I found on
Pinterest or whatever I just
specifically did these because these are
the kind of hair cells that I would do
it myself so I hope you liked it and if
you want to see just really quick
out-the-door hairstyles before school
then keep watching ok so for the first
hairstyle I am just going to part my
hair so that all my hair is parted to
one side instead of down the middle yeah
ignore my ridiculousness but anyway so
yeah after you've parted your hair you
just want to take the section that you
parted whether it's your bangs or
whatever and you're going to kind of
twist it a little bit and then you're
going to bobby pin it to the top of your
head now you can leave it like this but
I like to push my finger through it just
to give it a little bit more volume you
know just to make it a little bit thick
not like Snooki thick but just to give
it a little bit more volume so then what
you're going to do is you're going to
take the hair that you pin down and
you're going to start to braid that and
you want to make sure that the braid is
very very very tight so as tight as you
can do it because then we're going to be
softening it up and making it a little
messy so just braid it really tightly
so once you're done with that you're
just going to secure it with an elastic
and then you're going to have something
like this you can leave like this but it
seems a little Lizzie McGuire ish um so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start taking little pieces of the braid
and just kind of trying to make it as
messy as I can pulling it and yeah just
pull it apart till it's like very very
thick and it looks like you know toss
old and messy which is how I think it
looks cute that way so that's what I'm
doing here
it just makes the braid look really
thick and nice so then yeah that's how
that's what you're left with and this is
hairstyle number one I know that this
hairstyle isn't for everybody but I
think it's like spunky and fun I don't
know I would definitely wear this to
school I think it's cute it has has
pizzazz I think so yeah this is
hairstyle number one now let's move on
to hairstyle numero dos so for this one
I actually found a picture of this on
Pinterest and I fell in love with it so
you just want to take all your hair to
one side like if you're going to do a
side ponytail and you're going to take
an elastic and you know just make a
little side ponytail then the next thing
you're going to do is you're going to
kind of open a hole in your hair like
what I'm doing right here and then
you're just going to take your hair and
bring it through the hole so you're left
with something like this it kind of
looks like a bohemian fishtail sort of
braid you'll see it kind of looks like a
fishtail braid then you're just going to
take another elastic and wrap it around
your hair about an inch and a half lower
than where you have your other elastic
so if that makes any sense you see right
there so then you're just going to open
another hole in your hair and then bring
your hair through it again and you're
just going to continue this process till
you reach the very ends of your hair and
it looks really cute so I'm just going
to continue doing that until I get to
the very bottom
just tie an elastic about an inch or two
under the other elastic open a hole and
swing your hair through it and that's it
okay so that is it that is hairstyle
number two it's probably my favorite one
it just kind of looks like you did a lot
and it was extremely easy I love this
it's like a bohemian fishtail kind of
vibe I don't know I really love it
so that is hairstyle number two and now
I'm going to show you hairstyle number
three so for this hairstyle what I'm
going to do is I'm going to section off
my hair but just the hair that's in
front of my ear if that makes any sense
yeah I show you here just the hair that
just kind of there you go right before
my ear yeah I'm going to section that
off and then I'm going to take my hair
and put it in a low bun this is probably
a lot easier for people who don't have
long hair the bun would probably look a
little bit nicer but since my hair is so
long I have to like twist for days so if
your hair's a little bit shorter it
would probably look nicer but yeah you
just section it off into a low bun like
this and then the two sections that you
made you're going to start braiding them
kind of like a French braid so you're
just going to take a little piece of the
top of the hair and then you're just
going to start braiding all the way down
and then you're going to grab little
pieces of the front of your hair little
by little so as you braid you're going
to take little sections in the front and
just start um braiding them
and then you're going to want to braid
backwards so that the braid doesn't get
messed up but just braid towards the
back of your hair and just braid it all
the way down once you've already gotten
all the sections of your hair and just
braid it all the way down and then
secure it with an elastic
I suck at explaining this obviously can
you tell yeah
and then you're just going to want to do
it to the other section as well
so you just grab a section every time
you know you just grab a section as you
go that's the best way I can explain it
but you see what I'm doing so hopefully
you get it
okay so once you're done with that
you're going to look like a weird Pippi
Longstocking and yeah I don't know don't
judge me don't judge me okay so now
you're just going to wrap the braid
around your bun so you're going to take
the braid wrap it around your bun and
then pin it in place and you're going to
do the same with the other braid
and then you should be left with
something like this and I think it's
really cute even though my bun looks
really fat and weird I think it's really
cute because it looks like you put a lot
of effort into this nice messy kind of
low bun but you really didn't it takes
like three minutes to do this really
it's really simple and I think it's
really cute so now let's move on to the
last hairstyle okay so for this
hairstyle you're just going to want to
take a elastic like a ponytail kind of
elastic not like one of those little
ones and you're just going to secure
your hair into a low ponytail and you
want to do it pretty tightly because
what I'm going to do now is you want to
take your fingers and make a hole in
your hair kind of like what we did with
the second hairstyle and then you're
going to do the same thing and push your
hair through it so you make a hole and
then push your hair through the hole and
you're going to be left with something
like this
and if this is your style you can go
ahead and leave it like this but I'm
just going to kind of cover the
scrunchie or the elastic so that you
can't see it and I think it makes it
look a lot cuter so I'm just going to
take a section of my hair that was in
the ponytail and I'm going to start
wrapping it around the band and then
once you've completely wrapped your hair
around it and you just secure it in
place
and then you are left to something like
this and I think it looks messy but
elegant at the same time I think it's
perfect for school because it looks like
it looks like yeah you put some time
into this hairstyle but you really
didn't and I think it's a perfect
combination of messy and cute and I
really love it I hope you liked this
