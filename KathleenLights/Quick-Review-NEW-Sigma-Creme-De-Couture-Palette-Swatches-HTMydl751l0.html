sick I've had a cold for like a week now
I don't know if you can kind of tell in
my voice but it's just starting to go
away so I figured it probably wouldn't
bother you guys that much and - it is
raining today there is no Sun I know I
apologize about the weather in every
video but sorry so if you see me kind of
great right now I'm sorry
it was raining all day so there is no
Sun I hope it doesn't bother you that
much today's video is actually going to
be on a review I don't think I've done a
review no yes I have but I don't do many
reviews on my channel and I want to get
into doing more review videos for you
guys because I think they're pretty
helpful and I like watching reviews on
stuff so today's review is going to be
on the new Sigma creme de Couture
palette I got this in the mail today
this is a brand new palette I'm pretty
sure it launched September 9th so it's
been out for a little over a week now
and to be honest and none of the
previous Sigma pilots have ever caught
my attention but this one really really
did so it just looks like this and it is
a baby pink and green palette and it
opens up like this and it comes with 16
I shadow that were inspired by macaroons
I honestly think this is the prettiest
palette that Sigma has ever come out
with these colors are ridiculous and the
best part about it is that they're all
matte all 16 shades are 100% matte
there's no glitter there's no shimmer to
any of these eyeshadows which is what
makes it so awesome because my
eyeshadows are actually really hard to
come by especially good quality matte
eyeshadows because they can tend to get
a little chalky
but these eyeshadows are not like that
they are actually extremely pigmented
and super soft they're just amazing
amazing amazing this is a limited
edition palette so if you want it I
suggest you go and get it now before
they're all gone so anyway like I was
saying this palette does come with 16
eyeshadows the collection also comes
with three blushes but I
by them comes with a purple one a more
ready pink and then a baby pink and the
palette with the three blushes is only
fifty five dollars but if you want to
get the pilot by itself it is 32 bucks
when it comes to packaging it is a very
very sleek packaging very skinny it's
pretty small it's like about the size of
my poem and it fits everywhere it is a
top that comes off like this it doesn't
Bend back or anything but this would
probably get ruined if it were to get
wet but I mean don't win it but besides
that the packaging is really pretty and
in terms of quality like I said before
these eyeshadows are extremely pigmented
I probably will have swatches in this
video they are so incredibly smooth when
you put your finger into these
eyeshadows it feels like butter
literally it's so soft not powdery I
really really hate powdery eyeshadows
that it's like my biggest nono with
eyeshadows and these are not powdery at
all and they're matte which is crazy to
me the only bad thing about this palette
I would say is that it is a very summery
palette it has a lot of pinks and like
bright colors so the fact that they
would launch it in September I don't get
it doesn't make sense to me but I still
got it anyway because it's obviously
gorgeous but you can wear a very fall
appropriate eye look with like these
colors right here I'm actually wearing
these four colors on my eyelids right
now yeah these four colors right here
that's the look I'm wearing right now
it's a very far kind of smoky eye with
like the warm Browns and the oranges I
think it's really pretty so I mean you
can come up with some fall looks out of
this palette my favorite color of this
palette is definitely ginger pumpkin
it's this orange one right here because
it can go on super neon orange or you
can dust it lightly like in your crease
and it looks very similar to Samoa silk
by Mac if you own Samoa silk you know
how beautiful it is it's like this very
peachy like orange color and they
discontinued that don't know why but Mac
this
in unit and this actually looks very
similar to Samoa Silkwood if you dust it
lightly in your crease it's just
beautiful
so I love that color it's raining now
I'm just gonna go ahead and wrap up this
small little review before I go ahead
and show you these swatches at the end
of this video but I think this palette
is 100% worth it it's actually pretty
cheap if you think what you're paying
for every individual eyeshadow it's $32
and there's 16 iron shadows in here
round about to do the math but I know
that's pretty cheap for eyeshadow so
definitely check out the creme de
couture collection on Sigma Beauty comm
the blushes are really pretty I just not
a blush girl so I didn't buy them but it
is a beautiful collection I just I love
this palette so much so that's basically
it now I'm going to show you some
close-ups and some swatches okay so I
decided to sit right in front of my
window because it is pouring so I
thought that maybe if I got closer to
the window I would get more light and I
think I have this is a better look at
the makeup I'm wearing it is using the
chrome Nicanor palette I used these four
colors right here to get this look let
me know if you want a tutorial but I
basically just wanted to show you the
palette a little bit more up close this
is what it looks like and this is the
packaging it's really pretty it's really
skinny too I love it okay so my hand
looks kind of weird right here like the
way I have it positioned but you know
and you just need to see the swatches
that's what's important right so yeah
this one is red very Rose it's a very
very hot pink this one is apricot flower
it's basically a beautiful little
apricot a peach color this one is
beautiful it's called passion fruit it's
a very nice moth
this one is cherry blossom and it's a
baby pink color this is perfect for your
inner tear-duct or for your brow bone
this one is called mayor lemon it's a
really pretty pastel yellow this one is
my favorite one it is ginger pumpkin
this one is cafe the late
I don't know some french word I cannot
print
this one is blueberry cream it is a very
neon blue it's so pretty
the third section is for the purple
lovers out there
this one is violet whip it's just a very
pretty periwinkle purpley blue this one
is lavender honey
this one is cases cafes I don't know how
to pronounce that and this one is
elderberry and it is a very deep navy
blue it kind of looks purple on camera
well I would say it's a navy blue II
purple I think that would look really
pretty in the fall as well and the last
row looks like this this one is blue
sugar left very similar to blueberry
cream only less neon this one's a little
bit more pastel this one is almond pear
basically a seafoam green this one is
creme de menthe a creme de menthe it I
don't know but it's similar to this one
only with more blue and then this is
basically your lime green and it is
called Sitaram pistachio these names are
a little hard to pronounce but this
color is really intense
it's very lime green okay so I hope that
gave you an idea of how intensely
pigmented these eyeshadows are I hope
this review was helpful in some way I
don't know hope you enjoyed this video
