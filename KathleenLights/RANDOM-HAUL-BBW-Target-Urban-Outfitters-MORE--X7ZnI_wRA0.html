a really random haul if you hear noises
oh my dogs are here so I don't exactly
know how the lighting is right now I
mean I can see myself in the viewfinder
but I won't tell until I go edit this
video and I don't know how the sound is
if there's an echo in this room I really
have to check back the video once I edit
it but this is my new little corner for
the meantime if you guys saw my update
video you know that I'm not home that
I'm in between homes right now but I
borrowed a little corner where I'm
staying so that I can film videos I
tried my best to bring the holiday
spirit to my little corner because it
was just a blank wall with absolutely
nothing
remember this background this setup is
very very temporary I will only be here
for a month and a half but with all the
videos that I have pre-recorded I did
want to put some up that weren't
pre-recorded like this one just to have
current content in between videos while
I'm trying to move because you guys know
I'm in the process of moving and all
that stuff so do you guys like my corner
oh that's my coffee I throw it together
in like five seconds but bear with me if
you don't like it it's only temporary so
like I said in the beginning of this
video this is a really random haul I
went to Bath and Body Works Urban
Outfitters and Target I'm gonna start
with Bath and Body Works oh yeah
this little way so uh huh okay really
exciting this is the fine fragrance mist
in dark kiss and so many of you guys
know this is my holy grail bath and
Bodyworks body splash but they
discontinued it and I couldn't find it
anywhere for a long time I could find it
online but then they took it off and I
couldn't find it anywhere but they
brought it back and I thought that they
brought it back permanently but the lady
at the store told me it was only like
for this time of year so they only have
it around for the holidays so they had a
sale going on at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it
was buy three get three free so of
course not have six but I did give one
to my mom and one to my mother-in-law so
this is the best went and I got six
candles because they were on sale two
for 24 they used to be two for
twenty-two I think but they bumped up
the prices
I never buy bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks candles
full price absolutely never because
they're always on sale so I got six
candles I got mahogany teak wood just
because it's in their new packaging
every year they change up the packaging
in a sticker and this one has like a red
candle if you haven't smelled mahogany
teak wood it smells like a man like a
man's cologne like Hollister or
something the notes are mahogany cedar
wood oak and a hint of silvery lavender
of course you already know I had to get
marshmallow fireside this is by far my
favorite candle bath and Bodyworks mix
but I like to light it a little bit more
closer to the winter time a warm blend
of toasted marshmallows smoldering woods
and creamy vanilla and I agree this does
smell like marshmallow it does have a
sweet scent but then it has like a
woodsy fiery scent to it too which makes
it not too sweet and not too like
overpowering I had to get leaves of
course this is my ideal fall candle the
best candle in the fall time in my
opinion the notes are a rich blend of
golden nectar red apple and spiced
berries I smell all that I smell the
berries I smell the Apple ah literally
fall in a camel literally literally this
is one that I discovered for the first
time when I went to go when I went
shopping this one is called flannel and
this is very reminiscent to like
mahogany teak wood in the sense that it
kind of smells like a Cologne really
similar to black-tie mahogany teak wood
like those type of fragrances where they
kind of smell like a sexy man this
smells like a sexy man's body wash like
acts almost I know really really weird
it says wrap yourself in a warm blend of
bergamot polished mahogany and a soft
veil of musk very musky very manly but
my friend Stephanie says that this one
doesn't really smell like it doesn't
make your whole entire house smell so
I'm probably gonna have to burn this in
my future home in like a smaller room I
had to of course get something with
pumpkin and cinnamon in it this is sweet
cinnamon pumpkin I love anything with
cinnamon any candle described as
cinnamon I love it especially
again this smells like Thanksgiving
morning
honestly like Thanksgiving morning with
the pumpkin puree that's definitely what
I can smell mostly is pumpkin with like
a hint of cinnamon amazing this one is
really good I actually smelled the
pumpkin cheesecake one and I didn't like
it at all
it smelled like straight-up cheese in my
opinion no offense anybody I know Manny
loves that Ken don't put to me it smells
like cheese this was my favorite one
that had any pumpkin in it and the
pumpkin pie one was amazing too the
candle that I absolutely fell in love
with out of all of them it like blew my
socks off I had never smelled it before
I don't know if this one is new to this
year but it blew my mind
this is radiant red maple it's my
favorite one that I've discovered so far
this year it says it has crisp red
McIntosh apples smoky woods and a hint
of toasted marshmallow of course
anything with marshmallow I cannot
describe this scent it's sweet but it's
woodsy and fresh at the same time I have
to go back and get a bunch more because
this is my newest obsession of all the
ones that I bought
except of course mahogany teak wood and
- a marshmallow fireside I my top two
favorite candles this one has officially
become third place out of all the
candles they have amazing I have to go
back and get more smell radiant red
maple it will knock your socks off I
hope that it burns like strong like that
I can really smell it throughout my
house nothing I'll be wearing these
candles anytime soon all right so let's
move on to Urban Outfitters I got a
couple things there by the way I have
this really random collective haul to
share with you guys because I was living
in Key West and there is not a damn
store in Key West so when I came back to
Miami I was like hi
shopping now not just online I got this
shirt there and I love Urban Outfitters
but they're very very pricey like that
store is so pricey and I'm used to like
forever21 prices so I don't shop there
too often but I love the style it's it's
my favorite I got this shirt look how
cute this is
isn't it beautiful it was like $30 29
it's so cute but I love what it says
it's like a muscle tee and it says for
the moon never beams without bringing me
dreams which is Edgar Allen Poe even
though after watching the following
Edgar Allen Poe
gives me nightmares but still then I got
this and I know this is really random
but I got healing stones and it just
says keep these healing stones with you
to balance and revitalize your energy
you guys know that I've had like really
bad anxiety recently and just a little
bit stressed out and I kind of want to
try like natural remedies you know not
so much like my anxiety medication I
want to try to like find peace within
myself that sounds really stupid to some
people but um this is really cool it's
just like a little book and it has all
the stones in here now I don't know if
this is gimmicky or super fake but I
just think it's it's really nice and it
has amethyst which promotes peace and
removes negative energy you have a
venturi of entering good luck and money
gets rid of sad emotions sodalite
good for creativity and deep thinking
and it has a bunch like this one is
crystal quartz good for meditation and
diseases this one I like promotes self
awareness and self love Yoona kite I
know know how to say these words this
one I need orange calque calcite
balances emotions and removes fear
anyway this was $12 and I thought it was
nice something that I don't know will
bring a little bit of good things to me
so I got that and then I got this for my
keychain I've always wanted like a
little stone on my kitchen I thought
this was awesome this is a quartz like a
quartz stone and on the back it says
quartz has always been associated with
the movement of energy it is said
dispel negative energy while enhancing
positive energy quartz is believed to
enhance spiritual and personal growth so
I really like that I think it's pretty
and then the last thing I got at Urban
Outfitters was this this was six dollars
and I was obsessed with it when I saw it
it's a little elephant like I love the
pattern on this and I love elephants I
have elephants all over my house I love
them so I thought this would be nice to
like put my healing stones in and put
them like in in my living room or
something I don't know I bought this to
like lay my healing stones it comes with
a little bag so I don't know if I should
just keep them in the bag I don't know
if you guys know anything about healing
stones do I keep it in the bag
I don't know so that is everything I got
at Urban Outfitters let's talk about the
stuff I got at RJ that person know oh I
don't have a red card so I don't exactly
know what's happening but I've seen Star
Wars everywhere everywhere I go like no
matter what stored is I see Star Wars
everywhere and I'm not complaining these
are freaking love Star Wars so when I
saw this and nearly flipped my ship this
is a mug that I got at Target
I love mugs I like collect them on the
down-low
but I love weird beautiful mugs and this
to me is beautiful all kinds of
beautiful it's Darth Vader I don't know
if you could tell since it's all black
you can't really see the detailing but
it's a mug with Darth Vader's face on it
and it's so cool like for your coffee in
the morning that's that's cool and then
at the target that I go to there's a
Starbucks inside the target so my best
friend Amelia was like going crazy over
this mug she's like we have to go to
Target because they have such a
beautiful mug at Starbucks and when I
saw it I fell in love with it too and I
bought one as well and look at this
gorgeous little mug that they sell at
Starbucks it's like a low Starbuck thing
but it's like a mermaid mug can you just
can you just see this can you see this
do you just want to feel up on it it's
so classy and beautiful I almost don't
even want to drink out of it I want to
use it as decoration then I got this
shirt that I'm in love with the sandlot
is one of my favorite movies it's a
classic and this shirt
me at Target it says you're killing me
smalls and he's my favorite in the
sandlot this little chubby cube boy
freakin love him you're killin me smalls
I'm always saying that to people so I
felt like it was necessary me and Danny
always say that killing me smalls my
favorite candles are bath and Bodyworks
candles I think they are the best but
they are a little bit pricey and I find
that the signature so signature soy
candles sold our target are really
really good there's soy candles so
they're better for the environment they
burn a lot longer than regular like wax
candles and there's so much cheaper
these candles are ten dollars I got them
on sale for eight bucks it's like their
new fall candles these are a signature
so like I said so I picked a pumpkin
cheesecake and unlike the pumpkin
cheesecake from Bath and Body Works this
one smells delicious it has like
cinnamon in it pumpkin I already started
burning it it smells amazing the only
thing I despite Porter stop the only
thing I despise about these candles is
that they're to wick candles as opposed
to three so they burn horribly once they
start burning and they start going down
they have like the walls stay and they
just burn so ugly they don't burn evenly
all the way down no matter how long you
leave this on it's it's annoying but for
$8.00 I'll take it this one is really
strong and then I got this one which is
cinnamon pumpkin muffin I like this one
just a little bit more smells like pure
cinnamon pure cinnamon it's delicious
I definitely recommend checking this out
actually I'm burning one of these right
now this one is apple orchard and
delicious smell like apples right now I
also went to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble sorry I
forgot to mention that I went to Barnes
in almost and I picked up three books
and I love reading I love reading so
much one of them is technically not a
book actually I'll show you that one
first
so this is a journal and I got this herb
Arsenal's it's called the grass is green
enough a guided Journal for positivity
and fresh perspectives this is amazing I
haven't started using it yet but it's
amazing it's pretty much a journal that
you can write in every single day like
take the time out of your day every
single day and just write in like two
pages of this so it starts with chapters
and like chapter one is positive
Tildy when you turn the page it has a
quote here and it says a pessimist sees
difficulty in every opportunity an
optimist sees opportunity and every
difficulty and then it asks you on this
side like what does the same on the
opposite page mean to you do you
generally see yourself as a pessimist or
an optimist how can this sentiment help
you develop more of a positive attitude
you just write and then everything is
like every page is different nests you
different questions see like this page
is this right here and it says record
your most prominent negative thoughts
throughout the date and write them on
the glass half-empty below and then it
says now take a more positive
perspective and reword each thought on
the glass half-full
see like this page says name of the
negative forces in your life what do you
believe is the best way to handle each
one I just think it's a really really
cool journal it gives you really
positive quotes it's just something that
you can look at every day it was like
$12 at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's and I think it's
good you should pick it up the grass is
green enough on this side and then the
last two books I got were not like
fiction or anything
I loved why a novels are my favorite to
read I don't care if they're childish or
whatever I love like young adult like
romantic novels love them but I decided
to pick up two not two books this one is
very very popular everybody's reading it
right now which is why I wanted to pick
it up because I want to see like what
the hype is it says it's the what's
called the life-changing magic of
tidying up the Japanese are of declutter
and organization I love giving things
away donating things just getting rid of
things that I don't use on a daily basis
I love doing it so I feel like this book
will just really kick that into gear
even more and then this was a book
recommendation from my sister's best
friend Michelle this is like her
favorite author which I'm pretty sure he
just recently passed away this is dr.
Wayne W Dyer he's like a psychologist I
want to say I'm not as I sure I don't
know anything about this guy but he is
her favorite author and she told me that
this book changed her life it says the
power of intention learning to co-create
your world your own way dr. Wayne Dyer
has researched intention as a force in
the universe that allows the act of
creation to take place this book
explores intention
not as something you do but as an energy
you are a part of we're all intended
here through the invisible power of
intention this is the first book to look
at intention as a field of energy you
can access to begin co-creating your
life it's a book of intention so I'm
really excited to read this right now
I'm actually reading a book that my
friend Sarah let me so I will be reading
this one after I'm sorry this video is
so long
you
so that was everything I got please be
nice about this setup it's only
temporary but I feel like this you might
not like it and the lighting might be
off but I'm trying my best to work with
this this is my little corner this is
all I've got
by the way this says hello fall and I
got it at Target I got this at Target
this pumpkin at Target this at Target
this was a dollar this little tree and
then this vase at Target when I went
shopping I decided to get like a little
background like stuff so and I also got
