wait Malini okay that's it I'm really
innocent I have a whole ignore that
we're going to say it all me city ball
city go out thanks for your support
hey guys so today's video is going to be
a cat chess I recently asked you guys on
Twitter to send me a bunch of requests
on videos you wanted to see and a lot of
you wanted to see a video of me reacting
to my very first youtube video and for
some reason I thought I already did this
video but I didn't and that's what we're
doing today
all right you have nowhere to go
what are you gonna do step on something
that's it luckily I still have that
video up on my channel I thought for
sure that was going to be a video that I
would eventually delete because let's be
honest it's a pretty awful video but now
it's still there I mean it's my very
first video I ever uploaded on YouTube
even if it does suck like that's so
crazy to think I have hundreds of videos
on my channel now hundreds that's crazy
and it's also crazy to think I've been
doing this for four years already I
started my channel on my birthday in
2013 but I didn't upload a video until
February 23rd of 2013 so I'm enjoying
this for years the good things that
happened in last four years I definitely
have you guys to thank just want to
thank you guys for clicking that
subscribe button even though you didn't
have to I truly appreciate that and I
love you guys and yeah let's get started
let's watch my very first video together
luckily this video is only three minutes
and 22 seconds long but the funny thing
is that this video is on my favorite
permanent mac lipsticks and when I got
into makeup the first brand I really got
into was Mac because that was like the
it brand back in the day it was Mac Mac
Mac Mac Mac code if you weren't using
Mac you weren't cool Mac was everything
and mac lipsticks for everything my
sister and I would collect them but I
still have a few and to be honest
they're not like my favorite lipsticks
anymore they were my obsession in my
opinion nothing came close to it but
after discovering so many brands these
last four years and really diving into
like MAC lipsticks they're good they
smell fabulous till this day I don't
think a lipstick smells better than a
MAC lipstick like it just doesn't exist
but there are so many other brands out
there that make better lipsticks in my
opinion like or just as good okay so
this video is actually pretty
embarrassing I am like really shy and
awkward in this video I'm sure most
people if they're uploading a video for
the first time on YouTube are a little
awkward okay so let's get started I do
want to tell you where I am though in
this video before we start I was filming
this video in my bedroom in Mississippi
when I used to live there and it was
like pouring it was raining so hard when
I have filmed this video and I didn't
have any artificial light I was only
using natural light coming in from a
window so the lighting is okay like in
the beginning of the video but then you
barely see any of the lipsticks at the
end of the video I don't know why I
posted the video to begin with because
the lighting is so terrible like I would
never post that now but it was my first
video yeah okay so I'm just gonna watch
the video on my phone we're gonna watch
it together but I'm watching it on my
phone and so you don't hear it I'm going
to put on my headphones and I cannot
find my little headphones anywhere like
my little cord headphones so I'm gonna
put this thing on but the problem with
this is that I can't really tell how
loud I'm talking when I have these on I
look stupid okay let's do this hey guys
so as you can tell by the title this is
a video on my favorite matte lipsticks
um I only included permanent lipsticks
because I figured nobody really cares if
it's a limited edition since if you see
it and you like it and you can't redo
buy it because it's limited edition
unless you get on eBay for 50 dollars
but I wouldn't recommend me because all
right who's gonna buy off lipstick for
50 bucks I mean I still don't think
lipsticks are worth 50 bucks but I'm
pretty sure I bought I have purchased
tomforde lipsticks in the past like to
do for my luxury video and yeah I mean I
still don't think lipsticks are worth 50
bucks but we talked it was like sitting
in front of me
like making it really weird oh my two
feet dopey little bit come on okay oh so
yeah um craziest-looking so Young's
gonna go ahead and show you my favorite
okay how's the positive I wanted me to
react to my very first video but
honestly my very first video is just lip
swatches there's not much of a reaction
I can give you guys mint by the way even
the thought of miss grosses me out I
used to love that lipstick so much but
it is so white and chalky now that I can
you know where I got rid of that a long
time ago
pretty please was my very first MAC
lipstick I ever purchased
that's another thing when I filmed this
video I assumed it on my Canon Rebel t2i
and it didn't have a flip screen so like
right now like right now I'm looking at
the viewfinder right there my other
cameras didn't have a viewfinder so to
film this video I did have a tripod by
the way I filmed this video with my
camera on top of a bunch of books on my
windowsill i sat on the floor I put the
camera on top of the books and then I
put a mirror behind the camera so that I
could see the reflection of the video in
my mirror to see if I was in focus or if
I was at a frame you know but apparently
that mirror didn't help that much
I don't know what outro that was either
like I didn't even say bye Cornelius
let me bring Cornelius in you guys
haven't seen him in so long you haven't
been here in so long
he's already so annoyed pruning mitch
has got into that age where all he wants
to do is sleep he is such a like a
little grumpy old man so yeah I know
this video was kind of boring but I mean
my very first video was kind of boring
and kind of embarrassing but I think
it's good that I did this video because
it really does show you that you do not
need this crazy pricey ridiculous camera
to start your first video to start your
channel you don't need all this crazy
equipment like you don't need all of
that just start somewhere because you
never know where you're going to end up
I know that YouTube is completely
different than it was when I started
YouTube nobody really had all this
high-tech stuff but I don't think that
that should stop you from starting your
channel because if people like you
they're going to watch you for your
personality for your talent the way you
do makeup the stories you tell they're
going to like you for you not for what
camera you have you know and obviously
don't get me wrong if you're searching
on YouTube for a makeup tutorial you're
obviously going to click on the makeup
tutorial that looks cleaner crisper the
quality is better sure of course but it
doesn't mean that you won't get there
eventually you never know you you have
no idea where life can take you and if
you've been wanting to start a YouTube
channel and if you've been wanting to
start videos do it cert right now right
now that's right I'm talking to you you
you've been wanting to start your
channel do it because I think people
don't have fun with YouTube anymore
and YouTube is still fun I really hope
you enjoyed this video I thought it was
fun just to look back on what my very
first video looked like and it was a hot
mess I love you guys that completes this
video thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
look at this handsome boy dying a little
massage
oh you guys you do massages swing get up
get down
Celine get down why why do I even bother</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
