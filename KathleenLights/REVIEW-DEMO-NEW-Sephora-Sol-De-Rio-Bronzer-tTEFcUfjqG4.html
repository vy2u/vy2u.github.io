a review on the new Sephora bronzor
called song video this is what it looks
like it is large and in charge the size
of my hands it is gigantic I bought this
a couple days ago and I posted a picture
on Instagram and so many people wanted
me to do a review on this I wasn't going
to do a review on it at all but I saw
that so many people wanted it so here I
am reviewing it so far came out with
this brand new collection that looks
like this for spring and summer I don't
know exactly what the collection is
called but it has brushes and nail
polishes that this bronzer and I think
maybe a couple of other things but as
soon as I walked into Sephora and I saw
this just sitting there I was like what
is that and I ran up to it and I saw
there was a bronzer and i swatched it
and I was like you have to be mine so I
bought it and I am loving this so this
is what the bronzer looks like it is
absolutely huge the print on this
bronzer is so beautiful it has the
tribal print and the amazing little palm
trees in the back
this is supposed to be like a
representation of Brazil and it is
absolutely beautiful and when you open
it it has a giant mirror this mirror is
massive it's like so so big so it is
absolutely perfect because I could see
my entire face looking into this bronzer
and that doesn't happen with a lot of
others but anyway so this is what the
bronzer looks like on the inside it is a
matte finish you are getting absolutely
no shimmers and this bronzer and it has
just a beautiful tribal print on the
actual bronzer itself I don't know in
terms of packaging this bronzer gets an
A+ from me it is absolutely beautiful
yes it's impractical you this isn't the
kind of runs or you take to travel
because it is so big but I love the
packaging the inside is so pretty I
almost didn't want to dip my brush into
it that's how pretty it is the only
thing negative I have to say about this
bronzer is that it is a pain to open
it's like oh okay now it opens easily on
camera of course but I feel like I have
to dig my nails underneath this thing to
open it cuz
it's kind of a pain to open but I could
look past that
so this bronzer has become my new
favorite contouring bronzer I just it
just gives me the perfect contour in my
opinion I do show you a demo in this
video but it's just absolutely beautiful
what I love so much about this bronzer
is the texture of it it is matte but it
is almost a creamy matte I don't know
how to explain it you pass your fingers
through it and it's like butter
literally it does not feel powdery I was
blown away by the texture of it
immediately in the store when i swatched
it and it feels that way when you're
applying it on your face as well it is
very very natural that's why I love it
so much for contouring and it is not
orange if you are wondering if this
comes off orange on your skin it
absolutely does not you can even see in
the pan that it isn't orange they
definitely put a lot of thought into the
formula of this bronzer because it is
enriched with jojoba oil and sunflower
oil and I haven't seen many bronzers
have all that goodness
in it so it is supposed to be ultra soft
and almost moisturizing which is
definitely a big part of why it blends
so flawlessly and so smoothly this is
definitely like a bronzer for beginners
type of thing because it just blends
amazingly well because of the creaminess
to it I've also used this just all over
my face like not trying to contour and
it looks beautiful like that too just to
give you a nice and natural quick little
glow to your face even though it is
matte there's something about it that
makes me feel like I don't know that my
skin is glowing it's amazing but when I
do use it for contouring I use the Real
Techniques contour brush because it just
diffuses the bronzer amazingly I just
dip my brush into the bronzer and I
start to contour really really lightly I
build up the color even though this is a
very light bronzer it's very very
buildable so you can build it up to get
a little bit more I think darker
bronzing color so I just do that for a
while and I just build up the color and
diffuse it a little bit
blending it nicely so it looks like a
very natural contour and then I will
bring it up into my temples and onto my
forehead the center of my forehead a
little bit and I will do kind of like
that 3 motion and bring it down to my
jawline
and bronze that up as well and then I
will take it just a little bit of
bronzer and apply it to these sides of
my nose not so much for contouring just
to give it that nice little shadow and I
just absolutely love how it looks that
is all I'm wearing right now I do have
like some glowy glow a little highlight
going on underneath my eyes but I don't
have any blush on or anything like that
just this bronzer now with that being
said I do see why some people might not
like this this is a pretty light bronzer
I think this would work for very fair
skin too a little bit darker than my
skin tone but people with dark skin
tones are like very tan skin this won't
show up on your skin I just feel like
it's a little bit too light for pretty
dark skin the formula is so great that I
wish that Sephora would have come out
with two of them like a light version
and a dark version just so that people
with darker skin tones can wear this
because I mean come on Sephora you could
have made two you could have made it so
that is I know I made your downfall
because if it doesn't show up on your
skin then what's the point my suggestion
is to go into Sephora and swatch it
because they have this on display for
everybody to swatch and make sure that
it does show up on your skin and if it
does then I recommend buying it because
it is absolutely amazing the bronzer
also has a scent to it and I cannot I
still I keep trying to figure out what
this smells like to me it definitely
smells like something but I don't know
what it is it is a pleasant scent the
only thing I will say is when you are
applying this all over your face keep
your mouth closed because you tend to
taste it because it is scented and I
feel like I'm kind of tasting it while
I'm applying it I know that sounds
really weird but you know how with the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer once
you're applying it you kind of taste it
I don't know if that's just me but I
kind of taste my bronzer when I'm
applying it the same goes with this but
it's not chocolaty
it's like perfumey so be careful but
don't let that scare you it is a
pleasant scent and it does not linger at
all like once you apply to your face you
don't smell it anymore
I actually really like the scent it's
really nice another great thing about
this bronzer is how much products you
get you get point 88 ounces and that is
a lot for a bronzer just
to give you an idea of how much point 88
ounces is for our bronzer the chocolate
stole a bronzer from Too Faced comes
with point 35 so you do the math you
might never run out of this thing you
might never run out of it which is great
since it is a limited edition I suggest
you run and get your hands on this if
you are interested in it because it's
limited edition it is $22 in case you
were wondering which seems pretty
expensive but considering you get like
double amount of product than your
average bronzer I think that that's
pretty darn cheap so yeah that is
everything I have to say about these
Sephora so the video bronzer I just
absolutely love it I'm so glad I got my
hands on it and definitely check it out
the next time you are in Sephora let me
know down below if you have this bronzer
or if you are interested in this bronzer
I would love to know thank you guys so
