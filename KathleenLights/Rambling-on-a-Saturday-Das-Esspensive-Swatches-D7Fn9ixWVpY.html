Remley chatting video today I'm kind of
in a mood and I wanted to sit down and
just talk to you guys I want to sit down
and talk about just random stuff and I
always feel like oh I can't because I
have like content to put out I have to
do beauty videos and I have to do
certain videos and I can't just sit here
and talk out of my arse but sometimes I
want to do that and today is that day
so as you know I didn't post the video
yesterday I've had visitors staying at
my house all week
it was literally a bunch of people in my
house all week and it was almost
impossible to film a YouTube video
because you just hear all the background
noise and you hear just people talking
and people doing things like when
there's so many people around you having
conversations and all of that like it
comes out in my videos and on top of
that I honestly didn't want to I wanted
to spend time with the people that were
here and I know that sounds messed up
and it's you know YouTube is my job but
I don't want to be rude and they said I
want to be like hey guys you know what I
gotta go film a video she still talked
stay quiet for a couple hours I don't
want to be rude and I just wanted to
spend time with my peeps so that's why
there wasn't a video up yesterday and I
know that that's been happening a lot
recently my channel has kind of been
rocking a little bit but life has been
rocky a little bit that's another thing
I wanted to talk about you guys see like
15 minutes of my life three times a week
and it's always makeup talk like we sit
here and we disconnect from real life
and we talk about makeup on favorites
and tutorials and we do all these fun
things to just get away from life but
when the camera shuts off like my life
turns back on and maybe it's been a
little crazy which is why sometimes I
can't post and my schedule has been all
messed up and I had made a promise that
in the new year things are going to
change and I'm sure they'll by not
uploading yesterday which is why I
wanted to sit down and just talk to you
guys today those of you who get sad when
I don't post I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I
love YouTube I love what I do I feel so
blessed on a daily basis and I'm very
very grateful that I can post whatever I
want I don't take that for granted ever
but sometimes life gets in the way and I
can't post videos since I started my
channel since the very beginning when I
have zero subscribers I've been posting
three times a week and to meetups about
this little something
of editing I feel like I really post
pretty often there's a lot of people out
there who don't post nearly as much and
I'm not taking that away from them I
know life is crazy and not everybody can
post every week I don't know what's
going on and these youtubers personal
life like that's not me trying to bash
anybody who doesn't post often but I
feel like I do put in hard work and I
love making videos for you guys just
know that whenever I don't post a video
it's because I really can if there's one
thing about me is that I hate change I
hate falling out of my rhythm and when I
get a rhythm going I like stick to that
forever which is why since the beginning
I phone three times a week that's just
what I do and I don't ever see that
changing
unless something in my life forces that
to change and I live right now and so
sticking to three times a week and I
hope to continue to do that sometimes
things happen for example like coffee
from glam light guru I believe she posts
Monday through Friday five times a week
I don't know how she does it I do not I
don't know how she does it should I feel
like my life consists of zooming and
editing and for her to do this five
times a week she deserves a YouTube
trophy she inspires me every single day
her hard work and dedication truly
inspires me so I mean I don't know how
people like her do it but I hope that
sometimes when I'm not able to post that
you guys understand and yeah I just
wanted to mention that in this video
today is just a lazy Saturday chillax
day I'm going to put on a face mask and
I'm going to paint my nails rather
quickly I wanted to mention okay right
now I'm filming on my sony a 5100
because my canon has monopoly and this
camera is the camera I take on trips
whenever I want to like take photos if I
go on vacation this is the camera I take
but it has like a filter on my face like
if you see my face my faces and look
this like perfect in real life my Canon
doesn't do that my Canon is like HD and
like normal no filters but why does this
camera have that it came like that and I
don't mind that for photos like when I
take pictures or for a video like it's
kind of weird
does anybody have this camera does
anybody know how to take that off I
don't know and I don't know if there's a
button I need to dress kind of room I
don't know anything about cameras
editing none of that which is why my
videos are so bland
you guys have no idea how often I feel
like I fell into the wrong
business because I think all these
youtubers with these like amazingly
edited videos and I don't really know
how to edit I use Final Cut Pro but I
know that the bare minimum when you guys
have seen my videos you know that I
don't I'm not very good at editing I
mean you must know I want to take a
course on editing because if I can
improve the quality of my videos why not
I just I never know good lighting I just
know what camera is the best like which
one I should be using I don't know
anything about camera settings
I usually just film on the settings my
camera comes with so like I was saying
today I'm going to paint my nails with
my kale polish in that's expensive
I haven't spoken about it on YouTube yet
so I might as well just do it in this
video since this video is random and all
over the place anyway this is my limited
edition birthday nail polish that I
released some of you don't know but I
have my own nail polish brand it's
called kale polish I will leave my
website down below I have six colors
already in my line which by the way they
did restock all my nail polishes that
were out of stock officially restocked
yesterday or the day before and I know I
get a lot of tweets asking me like when
Zoey is going to be back in stock or
calomel or anything like that
all my nail polishes are currently back
in stock and I released this
limited-edition nail polish for my
birthday it's a really beautiful glitter
it's completely opaque in just two coats
you don't need to wear a nail polish
underneath in order for it to look good
could you know some glitters you have to
put like a thousand coats on for it to
look completely opaque there's a
completely opaque in just two coats it's
a really pretty champagne silver gold
and some mice it looks over like in the
camera it looks silver but in person
right now it looks way more champagne
depending on lighting whether you're
inside or outside is like because it's
silver or gold it's like a mix of both I
was saying and there are little rainbow
glitters all throughout it I need to
have a little metal Christmas tree here
on my vanity you could see it in my
videos like around Christmastime and it
was like a champagne gold color and then
it has little tiny rainbow flex
throughout the Christmas tree and I
remember looking at it like wow that
would be such a beautiful nail polish
like it it was totally my inspiration
for this nail polish and I thought the
named essence
perfect for it I want to be the type of
company that if I say something is
limited-edition its limited edition and
it's not coming back unless it sells out
like in a day which is never going to
happen but unless that's the case and
maybe I would bring a nail polish back
but when I tell you something is
limited-edition is limited-edition there
are Roman numerals under the word des
Princes and it is 25 in Roman numeral I
got a lot of questions about that I
named it that because this is the nail
polish I created in celebration of my
birthday which I turned at 25 in January
and also the reason I wanted to do that
is because now I don't know if this is
going to happen this is just in my head
and I feel like you guys are my friends
so I'm talking to you guys about a
vision I want to release limited edition
of birthday nail polishes every year so
if everything goes well and Kol polish
continues to do well next year on my
birthday I want to release a deaf
expensive 26 so I always want this name
to come back some way or another I
didn't want to just name something
densify sentiment never have it come
back ever again so next year I want to
release a dense expensive 26 it'll be a
completely different color I might be
like a pink glitter or a blue glitter or
something really fun and sparkly like I
don't know what I'm going to do yet but
I thought that would be cool to do every
year something special like that which
is why this one is definite 225 say I'm
going to do my nails now and I'm going
to put on a face mask this is the drunk
elephant TLC Sakaki baby facial I
purchased this on Sephora before my
noble I started and this is just an
innovative facial gently but effectively
exfoliates the pore lining and gets
Rizzo the fleeting skin's appearance
with improved texture and a more
youthful radiance which I'm someone who
suffers from texture issues so I hope
this works for me definitely going to do
my face mask first I mean that on my
gloves me and will see I've never tried
this face mask before we will see how it
goes so leave a comment down below how
your patterning has been going or what
you did today or what you're doing this
weekend or next weekend like how are you
doing do you have any major plan
they're going on making had any tension
where are you going I would love to know
I just turned on my vanity light
I haven't read you this would see apply
an even layer to clean dry skin I just
washed my face before I sat down here
apply some of my eyebrows on I have to
admit because I hate how I look what my
anger has painted no more than once is
two times per week leave on for 20
minutes rinse thoroughly with lukewarm
water and pat dry okay I think you look
at it oh my god I'm so sorry about this
lighting it's just I have to turn my
vanity on the room to see so it sounds
like up I think this is tingling already
oh my gosh I hope I'm not sensitive to
this I really do love it she was like
tingling already like a lot you're kind
of like a burning sensation a little bit
so hopefully what kind of it can you to
not leave this home for a minute
where's my home okay it's 456 p.m. okay
so it is 5 o'clock I put on the face
mask like two minutes ago so it's going
to round up here I'm going to take the
face mask off at 5:20 and then I will
let you know how I feel about it
it only tangled and burned like
initially when I was putting it on but
after I put it on my entire face it
stopped burning kind of strong for a
second and then it went away immediately
after I put on my entire face what to
take my face mask off I'm going to do my
nails and then I'll show you like the
coats of the nail polish if you can see
how thick it is okay so I just took off
the face mask and I actually took it off
at 5:15 and honestly I cannot tell the
difference just yet I feel like that's
the kind of mask I'm going to have to
use a couple times before I see a
difference but it did make my pores look
a little bit smaller which is nice so
that's the update I'll nut this video is
so fun ok so I haven't painted my nails
just yet because my mom just got here
she's been in Cuba she hadn't been to
Cuba this and her mother passed away and
all of my grandmother's siblings live
there like all of them she was the only
one out of all her siblings that lived
in the United States so my mom went to
go visit her family in Cuba so she just
got here and I've been talking to her
she got a couple of things from Cuba
like little knickknacks and stuff
and I'm going to go pick out what I want
and I'm so excited because I love
keeping things from Cuba so I hope I
will be right back ok so it is what I am
and my mom just left like 30 minutes ago
and then I turn on my computer and so
sleepy right now I'm sorry this video
was so pointless I'm going to insert
this footage that I just filmed and I'm
going to edit it right and early and
post it or I might get crazy and just
edit it right now I might do actually I
think I'm going to edit it right now and
post it right now if I can and then I'm
gonna take a shower and I'm going to
jump into bed and I'm going to read this
book until I fell asleep I think I read
this book a long time ago but I don't
really remember it much this is called
waiting for snow and Havana confessions
of a Cuban boy and yeah I'm gonna redo
this and then fall asleep every time I
start reading a book I like fall asleep
instantly I always go to sleep really at
like 3 a.m. it's horrible I don't know
what to do no matter what even if I wake
up early I just yeah I don't know today
was a random random day but thank you

around for this video good night I love
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
