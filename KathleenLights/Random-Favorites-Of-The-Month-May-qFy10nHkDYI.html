my random favorites I told you guys last
month that I would start doing this once
a month as well where I talk about all
my favorite products in the month that
are not Beauty related so today I have a
little bit of question and some other
stuff so let's jump into the little
fashion II things first fashion this is
a nightgown not like a grandma a
nightgown I really want to show you guys
this because I recently got it earlier
on this month and I bought it at forever
21 and it is a like sleeping shirt and
it is fantastic and I'm pretty sure I
still saw this at forever 21 in the
store when I was there not too long ago
I'd have to check the website so I if I
find it I will leave it down below but
this is what it looks like and it says I
need coffee
and I love it it's long it's really
really comfortable and it's not that
material that's like hot sometimes I'll
wear like a shirt like a really long
shirt to go to bed and it'll have
sleeves and I'll feel like I'm
suffocating the whole night I always
have to sleep in little tank tops but
since this one has like these barely
there sleeves like can you see it's like
barely a sleeve it doesn't bother me at
all so it's really really comfortable
and I literally just hang out around the
house and this so I've really really
been loving clutches recently which is
weird because I I don't go anywhere so
whenever I am going somewhere where I
don't want to carry my purse like if I'm
wearing heels and like a nice little
antsy you know I will wear a clutch and
I really have been liking this style
this right here the one that just folds
over I love it this one's my favorite I
actually bought this one I forever21 you
guys know I'm like a forever 21 chopper
I love it it's cheap and it's cute it's
that like luggage material I love it I
love this color I have like everything
in this color and I like it because it's
like a big bag that goes all the way
down you could fit a lot of stuff in
here and then you just fold it over zip
it on and you have your clutch and it
looks so so cute so I got this at
forever 21 and you would think I would
have gotten this one there too but I
actually got this one at Express
that color it's like that really pretty
bone nude and it has like a texture to
it I don't know if you can tell but this
one's like plain I just love it I've
really really been loving these
fold-over clutches I'm gonna see if I
can find some for you guys and link them
below because they're just practical and
beautiful so okay I've really really
been loving this website called life
brand calm I will link the website down
below so they sell like the cutest
t-shirts and it's life like l-y Fe this
one is like a muscle tee I love it it
has like the little flowers on the word
it's really cute it's nice to like work
out or just to hang out I love muscle
tees I'm very basic basic but they have
really cute clothes on the website I
actually have one that I wore yesterday
that it's washing right now so I can't
show you but it says the heels and it's
pretty much like a Miami style website
videos are from Miami then you might
really love this website like as soon as
you click on the website you see like
Dwyane Wade likes sitting down on a
chair with a shirt that says life so
it's amazing me and Danny are like huge
Dwyane Wade fans we love Dwyane Wade so
like my shirt it says the he Dalls like
if it's the Beatles but like the heat
like the Miami Heat it's really cute
they have a ton of shirts there were
really cool one was like a flamingo that
I like they're just really like beachy
kind of clothes they say different
phrases they have like a bunch of
different stuff like muscle tees tank
tops that they have a lot of cute little
beachy kind of clothes I will link that
website below I love it Dwyane Wade is
like I think one of the founders of the
website or of the brand I mean he's like
one of the people who created the brand
so it's really amazing since I am a big
fan I love him so definitely check it
out even if you're not from Miami like
go check it out they have really cute
stuff so my last fashion favorite you
guys it'll be no surprise to you because
ah bring them all the time but I have
been really really into kimonos for like
the past year but recently it's like
taking off like if you guys saw my
closet like it's full of kimonos so I
got this one at forever 21 I'm gonna see
if I can find it because it is beautiful
like what
it's a lip color it is beautiful I love
this with coral lipstick it's so pretty
and it's like that material that's very
very very very like good quality it's
like elegant it has a bunch of like
flowers on it but I like it because I
don't see a lot of kimonos with this
style like you all you always see them
with flowers but the flower is always
like colored but this one has like just
straight blue flowers and I think it is
beautiful I love it so much so I got
this one from forever 21 it's a prize
surprise and then this one I wanted to
show you guys because I actually got
this one at UM Kmart
I know I never really shot by Kmart I go
there for like drugstore makeup because
they have like a lot of jokes or makeup
that I can't find anywhere else but for
like clothes I never go to Kmart but
this is such a I'm like very into lace
like I'm very into it and this is a lace
kimono but it's not white it's like that
really pretty like french vanilla color
what a beige yeah I can see this is
white it's so pretty it looks so nice on
tank tops on like on top of anything
because it's that beautiful lace and it
gives it like a feminine touch it's from
a garden okay so moving on that was
enough of fashion favorites so I
recently got this earlier this month and
I have been so crazy about it I love it
this is the Instax Mini 90 a lot of you
guys may be familiar with it or with the
insect's Mini 8 it's the one that has
like they have pink ones blue ones mint
white they have a bunch of beautiful
ones and I was actually gonna get that
one instead but I saw that this one had
like more features this has a double
exposure you could turn off the flash
with the Instax Mini 8 you can't turn
off the flash whatever it does a lot
more so I decided to go for it this one
even though it's not as cute as like the
pink one I was gonna get but it does a
lot of stuff actually it's like a um
it's a Fuji film neoclassic by the way
that's the brand Fuji film it's not a
polaroid but it's like that Polaroid
style where you just you take the
picture and it comes right out of here
and
I have been crazy I took it with me to
California and I took pictures if you
guys saw my vlog but like I keep these
here this is Cornelius and this is
Celina and Porter actually a pretty
funny picture because I was like
unpacking and then I was gonna take a
picture of them and then Porter's barked
at me the second I was gonna take this
picture so you see him like barking in
the picture it's pretty funny and yeah
so so yeah I have been really really
into this I just love the fact that you
can take a photo and then like you have
that photo that memory forever and it's
not like stored in your phone it's like
physical photo I love that I want to
like dedicate an entire wall to like um
little pictures like this like travels
and family and friends and I think it's
like a really nice little thing to have
and the pictures kind of look like old
school like cool I don't know I really
really love it I will link it down below
I bought mine at Best Buy I will also
link the Instax Mini 8 because that
one's cheaper just in case you want that
one instead let's talk about shows okay
so my favorite show this month was flash
surprisingly because I'm someone who
loves arrow were like 20 million 50
million trillion times more than the
flash I think it's a lot better
I saw the I still do think it's better
but I really really loved flash it was
so good this month all my shows are like
done scandal finished arrow finished the
flash finish Sleepy Hollow has been done
did like they can't did they cancel that
because I love that show and I haven't
seen it in forever Walking Dead is gone
still waiting for under the dome they
cancelled the following revenge was over
which was awesome that happened recently
and I really like the ending I think
they rushed it but it was a really good
ending because I am so team Jack I've
been team Jack since the beginning I
loved Aiden but I was always team Jack
so yeah since all my shows were kind of
coming to an end or had already finished
I got into another show called
unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
it's a Netflix original series and it's
so funny it's with Ellie Kemper and I
loved her in the office she the plays
Erin in the office and the office
is one of my all-time favorite shows
like top five ever I was really excited
to see that she had her show she's the
star of the show and it's pretty funny
it's actually really strange if you
think about it it's about her and a
couple of other girls who are stuck in a
bunker underground because a reverend
keeps them there like prisoner for like
15 years for a really long time and then
the show starts like the pilot is them
being rescued by like the SWAT team so
she has to kind of like start living her
life the way everybody is living it and
she hasn't been in the real world for
like the past 15 years so she like
doesn't really know what to do with
herself it's pretty funny I definitely
don't think it's the best comedy I've
ever seen but it's a nice comfort show
and it's the show that I watched all the
way through this month I have really
been into Netflix original series I'm
gonna start orange is the new black
because yes I'm the only person in the
world who doesn't watch that show but
that's a Netflix or a new series and I'm
actually right now about to watch the
very last episode of the fall which the
fall is a Netflix original series and
it's with Jamie Dornan sigh excuse me
Jamie Dornan and he is a serial killer
and not like a cool serial killer like
dexter he is like a heartless devil of a
person murderer like he's like a
murderer so the show definitely is a
little bit dark and twisted but it's
like a binge watching show like I have
just been binge watching it it's kind of
disturbing which I usually don't like
but there's something about the show
that keeps me intrigued
okay so those are pretty much all the
shows I've been enjoying I want to talk
about a video it's a video I found on
YouTube a while ago and it just like
really really really like touched my
heart when I saw it so I'm gonna link
the video down below it's called
troll like trol troll and it's basically
a poem of like about a man expressing
his himself like against internet
bullies I'm gonna link it down below
like I said and the person who wrote the
poem who's like near
this poem is called shame poison poison
I cannot say that last name please watch
the video right after you watch this
video or pause this like forget about
this video and watch the video because
it is so so so like impacting and
brought me to tears and I was reading
through the comments and a lot of people
were giving that video a lot of crap
about it because the guy is basically
talking about bullying like straight up
evil people evil mean bullying people
and people were saying like why is this
video called troll like that's not
trolling this is building trolling and
building there are two different things
bla bla bla maybe it should have been
called bullying but watch the video
anyway it's so insane how it will make
you feel like it's so true every word he
says it's so true and it's so it's crazy
made me sad actually because it's a sad
poem but it's empowering and I want you
guys to watch it so I discovered Spotify
this month I had no idea what Spotify
was before you guys introduced it to me
and I got Spotify and I am crazy about
it that is another Brandon favorite of
the month is Spotify like I won't even
touch Pandora anymore I freaking love it
and I'm actually gonna show you a couple
of songs that I really have been loving
this month so I really like this artist
I've never heard of him before my sister
introduced him to me his name is Darwin
Darwin I don't know but I I love the
song just the girly things it's so good
and also by Darwin I really like dessert
it's good I really love this song by RAC
and I'm not exactly sure if it's RAC or
if it's like rec but the song is called
cheap sunglasses it's so catchy I love
it
Oh lean on Major Lazer oh that's a good
zone and a song that isn't new but I
have been crazy about it like I've been
hearing it all time it's from Big Mama
Thornton it's called sometimes I have a
heartache and this is like really really
old school this is the kind of music I
listen to all the time when I do my
makeup and I love this song
so yeah those are the songs that I've
been playing recently non-stop on my
Spotify which is my new favorite okay
I'm going to wrap this video up with my
YouTube shoutouts of the month
Porter was wrong my boy D oh my boy
Bobby says he just wanted mommy didn't
you didn't you I got kind of like a lot
of crap last month for saying that I for
shouting out youtubers who had less
subscribers because it made me sound
narcissistic but I don't care I'm gonna
do it anyway
I don't care what people say because
alana and serene really appreciated the
fact that i gave them a shout out they
got more subscribers because of my
shoutout so anything I can do to help
like a smaller Channel I will say
anything wrong with that
I think that's helping in my eyes that's
helping but some people think that's
narcissistic okay I guess this month I'm
actually a little bit biased a little
bit because there are two people that I
actually care and adore and love in real
life and it is one of my best friends
and my sister my sister started her
YouTube channel I will link her channel
down below she does more like fashion
and mommy type of things she has two
kids one is crazy her name is Sophia and
she does a lot of videos with Sophia
she's out of her mind that little girl
in the best way possible she's like four
but really like 15 so Sophia isn't a lot
of her videos and a lot of you guys love
Sophia from my Sofia interview so I will
link it but she also does like fashion
look books and stuff like that a lot
more than I do I get asked all the time
to do more fashion videos and I will I
will start doing more fashion videos but
anyway my sister does like fashion stuff
so I will link that and then the other
youtuber I'm giving a shout-out to I've
mentioned her a few times on my channel
her name is Gabby she is a makeup artist
in real life and probably one of the
best people one of the best people I
have ever met in my life like the most
caring and loving and loves her puppy I
love Gabby she's one of the people who
helped me with my anxiety
