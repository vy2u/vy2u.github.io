a video that I've never done before
please let me know if you guys like
these kinds of videos yesterday I posted
my favorites video which actually filmed
a couple days ago I didn't film that
yesterday and I wasn't gonna post this
one today but I thought maybe I should
post them back-to-back I don't know
today's video is very much like
yesterday's it's a favorites video I'm
gonna talk about my favorite products in
the month of April but they're not
beauty related at all
I thought it would be cool to do like
two separate favorites videos each month
one strictly related to like beauty and
hair care and perfumes and all that nail
polish all that beauty related stuff and
then the other one would be like food
home decor like fashion jewelry books
people you know stuff like that my
favorite videos are usually always like
20 minutes long I keep forgetting that I
leave this on let me know if you guys
like it on this is on or off
Porter stop growling at Selene let me
know I'll just leave it off for now I
just in case it annoys anybody so yeah
definitely let me know if you like these
random favorites as well as my beauty
favorites because I feel like I really
love watching beauty favorites I don't
know if people are interested in like
knowing my random favorites I don't know
if anybody cares really quickly before I
get on to the actual video I want to
mention something really really exciting
for me and I hope you guys find it just
as exciting I'm actually really terribly
nervous to tell you guys I did a video
in collaboration with E online if you
follow me on instagram you would have
already known I had like posted stuff
about it on Twitter and on Instagram but
I will leave the e online website below
I will link in the stuff below I was so
incredibly nervous it was it was for the
e online website we went to like a shoot
like a studio somewhere in Miami and
they filmed me and I almost died in the
process I was so freaking nervous like I
act like a complete fool on camera here
when I'm by myself but I am a very very
like
like scared of life but when I was done
I felt so proud of myself because I
would have never thought in a million
years I would ever have accomplished
something like that ever in a million
years so I don't care what anybody says
I'm so proud of me you know and I hope
you guys are proud of me too because you
guys mean so much to me I don't think
you guys even know it was really cool it
was for East Iowa collective not like
Ryan Seacrest or anything I thought like
it was for the East style collective and
it was kind of like a crest
collaboration kind of thing whatever I
will link that below I hope you guys
check it out and be nice anyway besides
that let's move on to my actual
favorites um I just filmed that get
ready with me video cuz I'm about to go
somewhere so I like filmed myself
getting ready you know like one of those
fast get ready with me is that I used to
do all the time on my channel when I
kind of stopped I wanted to like start
doing them again and I did it and this
is full drugstore like everything on my
face is drugstore and I'm really really
liking this look like really liking I've
been wearing it a lot lately the only
thing that isn't drugstore I just
switched it out is my lip combination
but in the video I do put on a lip
combination from the drugstore so that
video should be up in a couple of days
so the first thing I want to talk about
are these sandals I've been wearing
non-stop this month I mean I bought them
this month and they haven't left my feet
this is what they look like right here
they are Steve Madden sandals and guys
I'm gonna why I've already told you guys
about this website but for those of you
who haven't heard of it get ready I buy
all of my Steve Madden shoes on 6 p.m.
calm all my like expensive shoes I like
Jessica Simpson and Steve Madden shoes
those are my favorite kind shoes but
they're that's offensive
so I hide them on 6 p.m. calm and
they're usually like always discounted I
got these for like $40 I believe and for
Steve Madden that's that's a good deal I
would say I've gotten like Jessica
Simpson shoes like flats for like $20
that's a great website I will leave it
down below those people don't know who I
am my sister introduced me to the
website so I'm passing on the
information Danny hates them he calls
them my Jesus sandals men but I don't
care what he thinks I'll wear them
anyway if I can find them
we'll definitely link them down below I
got them this month so hopefully I can
find them if they are not linked I
couldn't find that most of this on
Instagram the other day I have become
obsessed with buying Porter little
t-shirts like this
Porter is my tiny little Yorkie if you
didn't know I have three dogs and I
don't get any clothes for Cornelius or
saline just because Cornelius doesn't
love to wear clothes and I can just tell
and I hate like clothes for girl dogs at
least the ones they sell at Ross they
all have like diamonds and ruffles and
puffy things like that for the girl dogs
and I don't like that I wish they would
just have like pink t-shirts or
something and Selena's are really like a
girly girl
so I feel bad putting a skirt on her you
know she's like a tough she likes
football
Porter actually likes wearing clothes I
know it sounds weird how do I know I
just know like every time I put a shirt
on him he feels like secure and happy I
just know okay so at Ross these are only
three ninety-nine these little shirts I
have this one that says size isn't
everything this one is my favorite one
mommy's little pal
oh no I love this one too this one is my
other favorite one good looks run in the
family cuz you guys know he's like
related to Cornelius so that's cute
right good looks run in the family and
then this one I got him for the summer
bikini inspector I actually got this one
at pet supermarket it was like eight
dollars he's actually wearing a red one
right now that says little dude so yeah
I've really been into that another huge
favorite of mine this month has been
this book right here I told you guys in
my beauty favorites video that I was
gonna touch base on this in this video
this is a book called don't sweat the
small stuff and it's all small stuff
simple ways to keep the little things
from taking over your life by Richard
Carlson this book no lie I feel like
changed change I'm not gonna go as far
as to say it changed my life but it
changed a lot about the way that I look
life recently I have just felt a lot
more positive and a lot more less
stressed out this book has really helped
my anxiety I mean don't get me wrong I
have crappy days all the time I get
depressed sometimes but this book has
really really showed me that I just have
to breathe and then I have to take a
step back and then I need to realize
that life is gonna go on whether I
stress out or not life doesn't stop for
anybody so why am I gonna over stress
myself for no reason if you guys are in
a bad place if you feel like wow I've
been really mean towards people lately I
have a lot of hate in my heart I'm just
not in a good place I highly recommend
you pick up this book because it makes
you a happier person it puts me in a
better mood it makes me happier it makes
me want to be kinder it makes me want to
be more patient more calm just a better
person and every day I try to tell
myself like how can I be better than I
was the day before how can I do
something better today that's basically
what it is it's a bunch of chapters and
each chapter is very very small like two
pages and it shows you different topics
chapter 13 is become more patient and
you see it's literally two pages and it
teaches you ways how you can become a
more patient person and I swear you read
this book and you're like oh my god yes
absolutely the advice is so good in this
book and like so true and so amazing
that you literally read this and you're
like why didn't I think of that it's
easy it's so easy I don't know I really
can go on and on about this book it just
makes you appreciate things more I
recommend this for absolutely anyone
this is the kind of book it's tiny this
is a kind of I mean it's not tiny but
it's small this is the kind of book that
you can just throw in your purse and
refer to every once in a while because
they're short chapters and they help you
I'm gonna read you a tiny little
sentence that I really really love from
this book it's right in the beginning it
says when you take time often to reflect
on the miracle of life the miracle that
you are even able to read this book the
gift of sight of love of Christ
the gift of sight of love and all the
rest it can help to remind you that many
of the things that you think are big
stuff are really just small stuff that
you are turning into big stuff now don't
get me wrong like there are in our
life that is big stuff not it's not all
small stuff you know there's things in
our life that we really like just put us
in a really bad place but little things
this helps you to just forget about
little things like being late to school
okay it's not the end of the world
little things like that when someone
annoys you when you're in traffic and
someone cuts you off and you think about
it all day and you're pissed that person
was just there to teach you a lesson
maybe they were there to teach you to be
a little bit more patient like little
things like that we need to learn not to
let it get to us and this book is
something that will help I'm going to
find it on Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and link it
below I feel like everybody in life
needs to read that book at least once
okay so now that I feel like I've been
talking about that book for like 25
hours let me move on so I recently got
these bad boys right here and I am over
the moon
I'm obsessed like I loved them so much
these are Bo's head headphones headset
this is the one that's around the ear
they have another one just like this but
they're a lot smaller they go on the ear
but I find that me that I'm always
wearing like earrings I really like how
they feel when they're around I can't
even hear myself right now it was crazy
I like how they feel when they are
around the ear you know like my whole
ear is inside this and it gives better
sound that way I believe like the one
that's on the ear you get like
background sounds and like surround
sounds and your surroundings and with
this it really just blocks everything
out these are bows so obviously they're
gonna be really really good quality bows
is amazing I used to work at the next on
bass and we sold a lot of bows and I
really love the color they're like the
cement color I will link these down
below they were pricey but let me just
let me tell you a little story there
were super pricey but I decided to take
the plunge and in bed
because I had beets Danny bought me red
beets I loved them to death I used them
all the time and they broke after like
six months of me having them ridiculous
and beets are really really pricey I was
so mad
they just freakin broke and then when I
started working at the next you guys
have no idea how many beats were
returned like on a daily basis beets
were constantly being returned at my
store because they break so freaking
easily and it's like man those things
are so expensive why are they always
getting returned so I have I'm like so
upset with beets because they're really
good Danny has a pair of beets that I
actually have never broken and they're
really nice and date the quality is
amazing but honestly if you're gonna ask
me okay I'm gonna spend a lot of money
on good pair of headphones headset
should I go with beets or a Bose I'm
gonna say Bose 110 percent and these are
so comfortable like so I can't even feel
them if you guys are on a budget and
want similar like headphones in this
similar style and that are really good
quality I highly recommend Skull Candy I
have Skull Candy for a long time after I
was like so it's kind of my lip gloss
after I had those beets I was like I am
NOT spending my money on expensive
headphones so I bought some school candy
ones and they were really really good
and they were fairly inexpensive but I
heard so many good things about this
that I decided to buy these and my
school candy ones were hurting my head
because they were like so freaking large
okay so this is really really weird
really really really weird but I have
been obsessed with downy UNSTOPABLES
this is what they look like
I like ripped off the thing I'm almost
done this is the lavender scent but I
decided to try out the dreams set and
I'm featuring this because I just
discovered this this month I had never
even I mean I had heard of it but I had
never tried it if there's like a pink
one and a blue one if you guys use this
let me know which one you love the most
either the lavender cuz I love the smell
of lavender but is the blue one good
it's the pink one good let me know but
these are amazing if you guys don't know
there's just
little beads that you unscrew the cap
pour it into the cap and then you pour
it in your washing machine and when you
go to transfer your clothes from your
washer to your draw here like instantly
you're like your clothes smell like
delicious lavender and they smell like
that after you dry them they smell like
that when you put them on I mean this
keeps your clothes smelling delicious I
love this Danny really likes it too okay
and then my last two favorites of the
month of April are kind of like
health-related if you guys don't know
I'm CUBAN like I'm Cuban and Cubans eat
rice like it's going out of style
like we put rice that is our side dish
to everything I am highly addicted to
rice I could eat jasmine rice or white
rice whatever every day of my life when
I worked at the next actually I worked
around a lot of Filipino women like a
lot of them and they ate kind of similar
to Hispanics they ate rice all the time
and I every time I would see the meeting
I was like I feel like I'm home because
in Mississippi not a lot of people eat
rice that much and I was living in
Mississippi
whenever I rice consecutively like every
single day for a long time I noticed
that I gained a lot of weight so I
decided to cut out rice completely from
my diet I mean sometimes I will eat it
on the weekends I'm not gonna lie it's
like my favorite food I can't help it
and I switched it was and I switched it
out for quinoa quinoa is a main thing a
lot of people really hate the taste but
I find it so delicious this is just like
another bag that I bought um I really
love this brand called earthly choice
quinoa kinda has like that rice texture
and I find that if you cook it with like
peppers that green peppers throw in some
onions and stuff like that you could
actually make it taste really really
good
I just grill up some chicken and I eat
my nice protein filled quinoa with my
chicken and I don't feel bad about it
because it's good for you and the last
thing for this video that I really
really like is this guy this is the
I'm simply coconut oil no stick cooking
spray made with a hundred percent
coconut oil
zero calories zero sodium zero sugar
that's basically like just coconut oil
in spray form and I used to I mean it's
like the Hispanic in me I used to like
make chicken on the on the pan like on
my stove and I would add like oil like
straight-up like if I was frying the
chicken like just a little bit of oil
because that's how you know you're
Hispanic mother teaches you a little bit
of our site there and flip it over and
stuff like that and that is not very
good for you it's not very healthy so I
saw this one day when I was at Publix
and I was like I'm gonna try that and
it's really really good because it
doesn't make your chicken taste like
coconut at all don't freak out but you
just spray it on your pan and nothing
sticks to it you can of course just take
good old coconut oil and put it on your
pan and use it like that but this is so
easy you just spray it and you're good
to go
so I really really really been liking
this oh no no I am not done I'm not done
