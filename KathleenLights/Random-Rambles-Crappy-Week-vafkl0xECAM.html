this you guys already know you guys
already know it's gonna be a random
rambles video today there isn't a beauty
video going up today as I'm sure you
guys realized already it's just been a
really really shitty week with
everything that has happened in general
with life it's just this week I just
don't feel like playing around with
makeup natural disasters are so horrific
and they take so many lives and it's
terrifying and traumatizing and just so
sad but when you have an attack like
what happened in Vegas where it was like
a human being and not something like out
of anyone's control it just messes me up
even more to know that you know people
can be so evil and it kind of just makes
us go a little bit backwards at least
for me because I mean I've spoken about
this a hundred times but I'm like pretty
much afraid of everything
certain events like public events
outdoor concerts or just public places
freak me out now and I'm kind of scared
to go out and that's so sad because you
know you shouldn't be afraid to live
your life you shouldn't be afraid to
leave your home and I feel like so many
of us do now take it from somebody who
feels that feeling a lot being afraid is
the worst feeling ever feeling unsafe
and fearful it's just it's awful it's
truly awful and I'm just so sad you know
I guess I just wanted the rest of the
week to be over it's such a terrible
week and I just in my heart I didn't
want to jump back into makeup I have no
desire to like play with makeup right
now and I know a lot of you guys were
commenting on my videos like you know
your videos entertain me and they take
my mind off of things and they make me
feel a little bit better for a little
while so I know you guys get kind of
bummed when I don't post or you know you
get disappointed which is why I'm kind
of posting a video today I hope you guys
don't mind this kind of video where I'm
just like laying on my couch and just
talking to you guys because I thought
maybe this was better than nothing
no and I felt like I really wanted to
like talk to a friend so I just turned
the camera on or any of you guys feeling
this way as well like just so incredibly
bummed and disappointed inside
with humanity and then I just went
online and started reading everything
that's happening in Puerto Rico and the
rest of the world and it's like what is
happening I don't know if it's just that
now we have social media so we're just
aware of everything or just the world is
going to crap I have so many subscribers
comments on my Instagram in my videos
telling me that they have family in
Puerto Rico and they haven't been able
to speak to them and like over a week or
over two weeks and that is so sad to not
know if your family is ok or not
and I'm so sorry if you're going to do
that right now I can't even imagine how
that feels no it's so strange because I
felt like at least for me everybody's
life is different so doesn't the 17th
started off pretty well and that was
like okay 17 is my favorite number by
the way if you guys didn't know and I
was like oh okay 2017 it's gonna be it's
gonna be good but I feel like it's it's
not it's not just so much sadness I've
been feeling really sad this year and
you know I have my moments
I have my moments everybody does you
have your days where you feel amazing
and then you have your days where you
just don't know what's wrong um days
like today where I feel like this you
know I just try to be grateful for
everything I have I'm like you know I
have air in my lungs you know I have my
family instead of focusing on all the
tragedies going around like try to focus
on all the good things trying to bring
the light into your mind because I know
for me when I'm feeling depressed or
down and all I have is bad thoughts and
just dark thoughts
I just feel worse and it's not until I
get myself out of the darkness where I
start to feel better and it sounds so
cheesy but fill your mind with positive
thoughts positive thinking oh my gosh
I'm so hungry my stomach is growling so
loud once you start filling yourself
with those happy emotions and like the
positive things and the silver linings
in life you start to feel better and you
just have to try to do better you have
to want to do better as well like if
you're sad right now and you really do
want to be happy you know if you're like
man things are just not going my way
right now I want things to be better
tell yourself that work on it work on
getting better but you have to work on
it because sometimes I do feel like
happiness takes dedication because it's
so easy to get caught up in all this
evil so easy to get caught up in it and
to just let it drown you but I have to
hope that there is a silver lining I
have to hope that there is a light at
the end of the tunnel and that things
are gonna get better because then what's
the point I just want to see a change
you know
want to see something get done it's
where we improve the world we all have
to play our parts as human beings I just
try and do better I'm sure most of you
guys who turned on this video have
already turned it off
and I'm talking to myself but that's
just how I'm feeling today I'm just on
the organizing net room I know I've been
saying that for like 6 years but I don't
know if you can see those box they're
like full of makeup that I'm gonna give
him away to Cuba I got rid of so many
things on that shelf I still have to
take those things off because I am
taking off that shelf I'm getting rid of
that and then I'm gonna put like actual
shows but they're gonna go across this
wallet you can't really see well there
and another thing you know what's crazy
I had gotten rid of this rug I took it
out and I left it like in my garage like
rolled up because I didn't know what I
was gonna do with it yeah and I put in
another rug and the dogs hated it but I
don't know how to explain it to you but
I just knew that Celine hated it like
she hated that rug it wasn't fuzzy or
fluffy like this one wasn't she usually
like digs her nose in this rug and she
was just not up she was just not having
that other rug so I put this one back
and yeah yes maybe I was so dumb
but anyway right now I'm actually gonna
go eat something I haven't eaten
anything else starving and I'm gonna
charge this camera cuz it's like
blinking red my battery's dying and I
didn't even know but I just wanted to
show you guys this necklace really quick
sure is like not letting you see its
full potential it is a new girl shirt by
the way
I know I've spoken to you guys about Co
which is my sister's jewelry line but
she just released these beautiful like
they're so so beautiful there are these
little breast cancer ribbon necklaces
and they have like all these little
colors it's so gorgeous it looks even
prettier in person
and it's so dainty and nice and I like
don't even want to take this off I feel
like I'm gonna wear this in the entire
month of October and if you purchase
these necklaces a portion does go to
charity so I'm gonna link my sister's
website down below I check it out but
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and end this
video here I really just wanted to tell
you guys like why I wasn't uploading
today and just a lot of things I've been
happening back-to-back I got really sick
last week and I still feel a little
stuffy like I couldn't stop coughing or
sneezing it was intense I couldn't film

I just wanted to let you know why I
wasn't posting and we will get back to

crying on my couch reading those
comments some of the stories you guys
were telling me about the people who
have suffered in your family from breast
cancer or you yourselves are going
through breast cancer I don't know
sometimes like exactly what I was
talking about earlier sometimes it's
really easy to focus on negative
comments and stuff but when I read
amazing sweet comments from some of you

grateful so I do quickly want to take
this time to say thank you for sharing
