Sydney and I don't even know there's
even gonna be any random rambling in
this video like is this even gonna be a
video I don't know
I'm on the verge of like a meltdown okay
so we're going to begin today is Friday
the 16 I'm gonna be posting this video
on Monday and honestly I wasn't gonna
post a video on Monday because my week
has just been so insane and I also won't
be here tomorrow or Sunday today the
only get me home this weekend but I'm
prepping for all the things I have to do
tomorrow but I know I had to give you
guys something even if it was just even
if it was just nothing which I don't
know if this even counts for some of you
I don't know if you guys would consider
this cheating but every time I have a
sponsored video going up it's always an
extra video I post that week so if I
have a sponsorship it will usually
always go up either on Tuesday or
Thursday maybe sometimes Saturdays or
Sundays but I always post non sponsored
content Monday Wednesdays and Fridays no
matter what like I give you non sponsor
stuff three times a week no matter what
that's just the way that that's just the
way I've been doing it since the
beginning of time
I'll post four videos that week instead
of three and this week I do have a
sponsored video coming up I knew I had
that commitment but this past week has
been so insanely crazy I haven't had
time to film all four videos for this
upcoming week I really have had
absolutely no time but I knew I just had
to post something I had to post
something on Monday I couldn't let you
guys down or upset you guys and I was
talking to my friend yesterday and she
was like well why don't you just post
your sponsored video on Monday what was
your other video Wednesday and Friday
like you know it's no big deal and I was
like are you new here are you crazy
so here I am sitting on my Beauty room
floor hoping you guys will forgive me
for this crappy video I'm so sorry I
know no I just thought maybe I would
just sit down and chat with you guys
tell you how my week has been tell you
what's been going on I want
you guys a few things and you know life
so I don't know if you know this or not
but the kale polish team is mainly based
out in Los Angeles like everyone at Keo
polish works in the lake except me no
matter how many times people tell me to
move too late she's not gonna happen
Cubans aren't allowed to move away from
their family I don't know if you guys do
that but anyway whenever we do the photo
shoots where we reveal each color the
ones I'm in like the big photo shoots
for every season um I do half of them in
LA and half of them here two times out
of the year I fly over to LA to them and
then the other two times of the out of
the year they come to Miami to me and
this whole week well last week when
you're watching this but this whole week
has been dedicated to the Keo Paula
shoots and all things Kayla polished so
we did some outfit fittings on Sunday
all day Sunday I was like trying on
outfits and seeing what we were gonna do
for the spring and summer shoot because
they came down to Miami to shoot spring
and summer then Monday was the spring
shoot which turned out so well I had
like this vision in my mind exactly how
I wanted this spring shoot to go and
Paris our photographer did such a great
job I'm really bringing my vision to
life she's amazing I love her and then
on Tuesday I had another shoot for a
secret product that will be coming out
later on in 2018 and then on Wednesday I
had the summer shoot which we just
finalized the summer colors and I'm so
excited for summer I think that's after
spring so more excited for spring but we
had this summer shoe and it was an epic
shoot because the summer collection I
don't want to say just yet I don't want
to talk about it just yet but it's a
very very special launch for me it's a
very special collection and you'll see
why in a few months like later on once
summer rolls are out and so we did that
on Wednesday it was a full day I didn't
get home till like really late at night
and then on the Thursday which was
yesterday
we filmed the summer commercial which we
always do behind-the-scenes footage of
the photoshoots and that's what we post
on the KO polish YouTube channel instead
of commercials like we do like a BTS of
that season but because summer is so
special to me I really wanted a
commercial music video type of vibe to
celebrate the launch of summer and I had
my entire family involved in the
commercial so we were filming that all
day yesterday from one pan to one in the
morning it was insane I feel so bad
Danny's grandma was there and she was
like in charge of a certain scene in the
commercial and she had to do it over and
over and over again and she's almost 80
and she was like done after like the
10th time but I have a feeling it's
gonna turn out really really cute and
exactly how I envisioned it but it was
really cool to have my entire family and
all many friends involved in something
that I'm creating and something that I'm
working on I could barely walk this
morning like when I got up out of my bed
the bottom of my feet felt like I had
been walking for months and months and
months mind you I had my heels on from
one pin til 1:00 in the morning
that's a long that's a long time for
somebody to be walking in heels
especially someone like me who is never
in heels who hates who hates heels so
much it was rough my feet are like
swollen I have cuts all over my toes
it was crazy look at my eyes like look
at this look at these dark circles I
haven't slept in days guys days but we
got through it and it was just so fun
and I honestly I'm so grateful I
honestly can't wait to see it it's so
far in the future it's like months and
months away but I can't wait to see it
and that's basically what I've been
doing all week that's why I've been
pretty m.i.a on social media I really
haven't posted much on Instagram or
Twitter it's just been a crazy week it's
been a rough week I never thought it
would get to a point where like juggling
kale polish and YouTube would be a
little bit stressful but it is only when
we're doing things like this where we
like cram everything into one a week but
I just love YouTube so much it's my
number one job I care about it so much
because I care about like my subscribers
so much and I don't ever want to be like
that slack off youtuber unless I decide
like you know what I don't want to do
YouTube anymore I don't see that
happening anytime soon but unless I wake
up and decide like this just isn't for
me anymore like I just don't see myself
stopping and I love posting three times
a week just because I love putting out
content I can't picture myself ever
posting like once a week but I really
try to make as much time as I can and
I'm usually really good at it but this
week was kicking my ass
and by the way I know
look crazy like my arms an orange right
now but I promise you they're not I got
a spray tan from a summer photo shoot
and this free time completely wore off
on like my hands and my face already
because I've washed them like a trillion
times but if that's why I look a little
bronze that's why it looks like so
freakin orange on my camera but I
promise you it's not oh my gosh you know
I feel like delusional right now I
honestly feel delusional but that coffee
didn't do much to wake me up I'm like a
zombie right now no I wanted to show you
guys okay so I got these two boxes in PR
yesterday I got the new la girl
Foundation this is the pro matte
foundation and C's and I'm gonna poo and
la girl is such an affordable brand like
really affordable they have kind like
the same prices is women wild and it
says it's an HD long wearing matte
foundation I don't know how I'm gonna
feel about this obviously because I'm
very dry skin and I don't tend to reach
for matte foundations that often but
sometimes I'm at foundation will
surprise me I don't know maybe I'm gonna
give it a shot or would you rather see
it first impressions on this foundation
this is the Marc Jacobs shameless
foundation shameless
youthful look 24-hour shameless youthful
look 24 hour foundation with SPF 25 I
have to say I haven't been really really
excited for a foundation lunch out here
in a really long time like I haven't
seen a foundation and thought oh my gosh
I cannot wait to try that I need to get
my hands on that I haven't felt that way
in a while until I saw this foundation
for some reason packaging the way
they're marketing it like their photo
shoots the way it looks like the way
they describe the formula this just
screams my name this looks like a
foundation I would love so much so I
have extremely high expectations for
this and I'm gonna be so bummed if I
don't like it because I literally have
never been more excited for a foundation
like I am I'm really really excited
what color I would be I love this
freakin packaging actually someone who
would prefer a plastic squeezy tube over
a glass bottle with a pump I'm a mess I
drop everything I break everything I
travel a lot and glass usually breaks so
I really like that this comes like this
you just twist it off and you squeeze it
on the back of your hand and boom oh my
gosh feels very lightweight it just sank
into my skin right there oh my gosh I
cannot wait to try it
anyway speaking of Mercator I just got
this perfume and it's the new okay I
don't know if it's new but it's new to
me this is a new Marc Jacobs Daisy and
you know how Marc Jacobs has a ton of
daisies they had the original daisy and
then they have few other ones this one
is twinkle oh my gosh this is the first
Daisy I actually like like don't get me
wrong I love the original Daisy and a
lot of the times I'll ask somebody like
oh my gosh you smell so good what are
you wearing and they'll tell me Marc
Jacobs Daisy and I'm like really like I
it's crazy because it smells so good on
so many people but it just does not
smell good on me it turns almost like to
florally on my skin and it just doesn't
work with my chemistry and I've never
liked any of the other daisies until I
discovered this one and I'm not even
gonna lie to you I bought this
completely on a whim I hadn't even
smelled it and it purchased it off the
sephora website just because I thought
the bottle was so beautiful look at this
bottle look at this cap this is stunning
I love it this like speaks for the child
in me like the 90s child in me I don't
know what it is so I purchased it when I
got it in the mail and I smelled it I
was so pleasantly surprised I am so
happy with it it's honestly I know I
know I know I say this about everything
but this smells like my job my childhood
oh my gosh you know what this smells
like to me okay I don't know if it's a
Hispanic thing but you know the perfume
you like that like I said I got now I
froze and said I'm O's in Miami which
I'm sure you guys don't have those
stores but I'm gonna put a picture up
here it's the Violeta perfume I'm not
talking about the the gold one that
one's the best
you know like the gold when I don't know
if it's your leg but it's so Saint
Augustine one a my same theory
I'm talk about that I'm talking about
the purple you let that one this reminds
me so much of that I think it's like the
same oh my gosh this smells like me
taking a bath when I was younger and my
mom putting this all over my body but
like a grownup version it has like an
adult twist to it oh my gosh this smells
so delicious and it's so nostalgic to me
that I cannot stop wearing it's such a
beautiful set and I honestly cannot wait
to wear this in the springtime because I
feel like it's such a I spray it all up
a little goes a long way and have it
displayed in my bathroom like all my
little shelf because I think it is so
pretty oh by the way I a lot of you guys
were asking me in my last random rambles
video if I have put the rainbow thing on
my window yet you know I told you guys I
bought that rainbow thing it was gonna
project rainbows in my bathroom no no I
have not
danny has not put that up on my window
yet we've just been so crazy busy I
haven't had time but I'm totally gonna
do that this week coming up yes I am but
anyway um I just kind of wanted to
update you guys today that's why my
video went up late on Friday but yeah
I've kind of been dealing with a lot of
things internally and emotionally I've
just been a little bit stressed and when
I'm stressed I don't really work well
it's so weird but I couldn't sit down
and film a beauty videos today for some
reason my heart just wasn't in it I just
I just wasn't in it so I hope you guys
don't hate this video I know it's really
boring and I know it doesn't make up for
having a sponsor video up this week it
doesn't count I know it's totally
cheating please don't be mad at me I
know you know it's been helping well not
helping but I hold up
oh my tailbone hurts so freakin bad
every time I pick up something heavy or
like I put pressure I have so much pain
in my tailbone because last weekend last
weekend I kind of fell when I was
rollerblading I kind of lost my balance
a little bit and I fell backwards right
on my arse but like not even on like my
butt cheek
I felt like right on my tailbone I
actually have footage of that because I
caught it
cameras I have like a security system my
camera system in my house and I caught
it on camera so I'm gonna play that for
you guys really quick
you
yeah yeah I just wanted to share that
with you guys cuz every time I stand up
I feeling in my bone so I really need to
go to the doctor next week because I
don't know if I did something wrong I'm
not sure anyway what I was gonna show
you because some for some reason holding
this little purple thing reminded me of
this little purple thing but this is the
kora organics calming lavender mist this
is from Miranda Kerr I believe this is
like her new brand and I got it because
it has aloe vera in it and lavender and
I love anything with either of those
things I love the scent of lavender it's
so soothing it honestly really helps my
anxiety I walk around with like a little
lavender oil and I keep it in my purse
at all times and I'm always smelling it
I also keep peppermint oil in my purse
as well because I like to rub peppermint
oil on the back of my neck which you
should try that if you're ever like kind
of stressed out and you're maybe having
a panic attack and you feel like you
can't breathe and you feel like you're
getting really hot rubbing peppermint
oil on the back of your neck will save
your life I'm not even joking get some
peppermint oil and get some latigo as
well because it just breathing it in
just helps you relax and be calm but
anyway I picked this up on Sephora
because it has certified organic aloe
vera noni extract and lavender essential
oil for providing a relaxing and gentle
mist that soothes refreshes and protects
your skin and I have been using this a
lot this scent even the mist is
extremely calming look at that like wow
that's another amazing miss folks this
smells so so good and I do feel like it
hydrates my skin a bit like if I apply
this all over my face my skin feels nice
and hydrated and I really have been
liking this a lot and I don't know for
some reason I just wanted to share that
with you guys I'm so random and these
random rebels videos rightly some of
them don't even make anything but anyway
um I think I'm just gonna wrap up this
video here I'm sorry this past week I've
been kind of am I on YouTube as well not
really replying to comments as often as
I usually do but it's been a really
really hectic week and should get back
into the swing of things I hope you guys
don't leave me and I hope you guys still
love me and
you want to leave me any requests in the
comments below for future videos just
always constantly request things for me
