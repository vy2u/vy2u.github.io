disappoint a lot of you today there
unfortunately it won't be a video going
up today well I mean this is a video
right now but I won't be posting like a
beauty video or a favorites video
because really it's just been a crazy
couple days and I haven't had time I'm
going to try my best to do it tonight
I always film on Tuesdays and Thursdays
because those are the days where I'm
really free a lot of construction going
on in my house right now and there's a
lot of people in my house Mondays
Wednesdays and Fridays so I really only
have time to myself Tuesdays and
Thursdays on the weekends so those other
days I have to film but today I actually
have an appointment with time okay I
have time I have an appointment in two
hours and it's just something that's
been worrying me I've kind of had like a
pain in my right boob well I'm not
worried I'm trying to snoozing in life
where I'm not going to worry
unless there's actually something for me
to worry about quarters at the door and
I just want to talk to my gynecologist
about it because well a couple a few
months ago my husband sure I don't
remember I did kind of an x-ray of my
chest and it came back that I had like a
sis it wasn't like cancerous or anything
but I just want to make sure that that's
okay it's just something that worries me
because my grandmother died of breast
cancer so it runs in my family my idea i
Willa alpha howda in Cuba but she's
alive she's currently so in Cuba she's
just missing a book but she's alive
which is what's important my grandmother
just um I think she just didn't catch it
in time she had it for a really long
time before any of us knew so the cancer
took her pretty fast so I'm just I just
like to stay on top of it because I have
that fear in me I don't like talking
about personal stuff on YouTube ever as
you guys know I like to keep my private
like my private life private I like to
talk about makeup here but I thought I
would give like a mini little rambly
vlog today because you guys like my
class Saturday rambling video and yeah
I'm sorry that there's no like good
content going up today it's just it's
been a crazy few days and I'm not gonna
be able to film I'm going to try my best
to some tonight though so I think my
nail polish oh look at this it looks
hideous I'm going to do that before I
head out this is OPI my boyfriend skills
walls so anyway that's what this video
is going to be today we're just going to
stay here we're going to chat we're
going to hang out and yeah hi guys okay
I'm sorry about the lighting my windows
right here I'm in the bathroom in my
beauty room
and I just want to like into something
to my hair I look a little crazy right
now there is a huge mess in this room I
just have things like piled up next to
my sink which is driving me mad because
I hate I hate clutter I'm gonna win with
this apple cider vinegar leave-in hair
treatment I bought this on Sephora a
while ago and I need some time to time
but normally I really notice anything
crazy I feel like my hair needs a little
bit of moisture Oh smells so bad like
really smells like apple cider vinegar
it's like no but it had great reviews
have you guys seen the show humans my
dad was telling me about it he said it
was really good let me know if you've
seen it because Danny and I were
watching Westworld and it was good like
we'd liked it but we weren't blown away
by Wis world I hear that human is pretty
good which isn't also like a robot show
so if you've seen that one let me know
because I won't watch it so I'm going
with my moose now I just recently
purchased this yeah by the way I totally
gave up on my no lie this is the L'Oreal
new air dry it ruffs body moves heat
freestyle frizz resistant and strong
holes for waves and curls strong hole
kind of scares me a little bit but I've
used it about twice now and I think I
kind of like it gives your curls a nice
hold but it really doesn't feel crunchy
but the best part is this move I've
never I've never had a move that smelled
this good there's a bug on my wall it
smells incredible
I don't know it sounds oh my god smell
the meeting it's not like a perfume I
like the look of very slowly not like
crispy curls and then I kind of brushed
on the top here because this part is
really frizzy oh you ask me all the time
like what do you do to keep your hair
curly as the days go on because you know
when you have curly hair you can't
really brush it all that much because it
will just get really frizzy my hair
isn't nearly as curly as it used to be
when I was younger I have just been
ironing it for so many years that the
curls have completely dyed so what I do
I talking about this in previous videos
but just in case you don't know what
I'll do is I'll just spray my hair with
water I have like this little in my
other bathroom I have just an empty
spray bottle and I filled up with water
and before but I'll kind of
Spray my whole head not right drench it
just dampen it a little bit scrunch it
up with a little bit of like styling oil
and then I'll go to bed and when I wake
up my curls are look more refreshed
because the water disagree activates the
curls and I'll do that for a couple of
days before I wash my hair so yeah I
don't know if you can felt that the
Mullis just makes a little bit of a
difference and once it dries completely
it's not crunchy like I could put my
fingers through my hair it's like a
super crunchy mousse and this smell is I
can't even I can't I can okay so now I'm
going to go eat really quick with Danny
and then I'm going to apply a little bit
of makeup and go to my appointment this
video is so stupid
okay so I took a little bit longer than
I wanted to in the kitchen I was just
sitting there talking Brad with Danny
and they didn't realize where my time
went I did end up taking off my nail
polish I had time to do that and I just
put the nail tape it's like a base coat
it's supposed to be for soft peeling
meals so I wanted to see if maybe it
strengthened my nails a little bit my
nails have been growing really long I'm
use it in the past as like a primer
before nail polish but I've never used
it on its own
I actually have to leave my house in 20
minutes so I'm just going to put on a
very minimal make-up I have been wanting
to talk to you guys about tail polish
and certain plans and certain things I
had to do and I thought this video would
be the perfect way for me to just sit
down and talk to you guys about that
because I feel like it wouldn't make
sense to fit this in any other videos
because nobody wants to hear me sit and
ramble about nail polish but a lot of
you guys have been asking you know when
is the spring line coming out when your
going to release it when you get a
revealer shade in okay where do I start
unfortunately I was kind of crammed on
time when it came to the spring nail
polishes we've kind of done like an
entire year of kale polish like we did a
whole calendar and we planned out the
whole year for the brand and so far it's
going really smoothly it's just we've
kind of hit a bump with the spring line
not in terms of shipping or quality or
anything because it's my exact same
formula it's just I was kind of unhappy
with two of the shades mainly one of
them but I was kind of unhappy with two
of them so I kept sending it back and
sending it back and sending it back and
obviously when you're on a time crunch
or when you're on a schedule you have to
stick to it but I really just wanted
these colors to be perfect
and I wanted to release colors that I
truly loved it if I didn't truly love it
I didn't want to release it so what that
means that I finally perfected the two
shades now I'm so happy with them I love
them so much and unfortunately it kind
of meant that we had to push back the
launch and now they won't launch till
April when they were supposed to launch
like the first week of spring so I mean
it's not that far off that's not gonna
affect shipping or anything like that it
just affects the launch date and I was
really really sad about it I was so
bummed because every like nail polish
brand Orly s see all of those nail
polish brand OPI they've already
released their spring line and I know
that sucks but like I said I feel like
people expect tail polish to be perfect
right off the bat because I'm a youtuber
with a lot of subscribers but oh my gosh
it's a lot harder than what looks good
there's so many factors that play into
that but the good news is I am almost
completely done with approving my date
I'm almost completely done with
approving my summer shade the only one
that is a little delayed is 2017 spring
collection which I'm so sorry now that I
know more or less you know we did the
winter line and now we're doing the
spring line and I'm getting used to it
and I'm getting comfortable and now I
know I know I know you know Alyssa so
we've been planning the whole year so I
just wanted to give you that quick
little update on Kayla polish please
bear with me
spring lion coming soon so I wanted to
ask you guys okay so I've been watching
a lot oh no I have been watching a lot
of documentaries on Netflix I'm just
like really into documentaries right now
and but they mainly been like kind of
scary and they're kind of freaking me
out I've been watching a lot of like
serial killer ones and I really
shouldn't be doing that because I am the
world's biggest chicken so I feel like
I'm making it hard on myself to go to
sleep but if you guys know any really
cool documentaries just really
interesting ones on YouTube
please let me know they can be about
anything as long as they're interesting
I'm open to anything I've been wanting
to do a cat chats all about the Peter
Pan flight if you guys don't know what
that in its operation my little bong
it's a Cuban plane and I have been
wanting to do a catch-up all about my
little bomb just to inform everyone cuz
there's a lot of things about Cuban
history that people don't know about let
me know if there's something you'd be
interested in it kind of been reading up
on it there's a lot of things I know
from what my family members have told me
but I have been doing more research on
it and if it's something you want to see
I would love to do that so let me know
in the comment below which are so do I
have the world's most riots crazy lips
ever I have been using my cred guava I
love this thing I keep you here in my
video before I go to bed I always put on
aqua for sometimes I feel like nothing I
try really takes away the dryness of my
lips oh wait I already purchased two
backups of my Milani make it last
setting tonight it was sold out on the
Milani website I was tweeting about it
but they restocked and I got to back up
I'm just going to set everything because
I don't have time to get a hickey
this is the real 5-minute medium okay so
my camera turned off about five minutes
ago because it said it was overheating
it just turned off because the
temperature was too high but all I did
was put on some bronzer and now I have
to go to my appointment so I will talk
to you dad like okay so I'm back it's
actually been many hours since the last
time I spoke to you guys and went to my
appointment when I got there my
gynecologist was actually like in an
emergency delivery or something of that
she was still stuck at the hospital and
they told me that she was not going to
be returning because she had an
emergency so I got there and I couldn't
see her so I had to come home and I had
to reschedule my appointment for later
next week but if it's not one thing it's
the other I had to do like a million
things before I was able to finally come
back home to tell you guys I would
update you in this video but there's
nothing to update oh look at this he's
always so aggressive with her and she
does nothing to him my sweet angel why
are you a savage to everyone else but
you're so kind to put a bully graininess
is not with us in here right now playing
because he loves to be asleep in my room
like in my bedroom on my bed and he
hates hanging out with us he thinks
sport is annoying which I don't blame
him meaning go Wayne Eagle Porter and he
sounds like he's hurting her but he's
really gentle
Corner
he's like she's like barely biting her
he's so cute they love each other so
much it is beautiful okay you guys are
boring my audience nobody wants to see
you just lay there and go to sleep
Selene gosh
okay so hello guys I just found some
mascara I use the Tarte lifted mascara I
use this for the first time today and I
don't know if I like it I love the color
it's like a black brown I'm obsessed
with this packaging anything with a soft
touch you got it it's my favorite but it
felt a little clumpy I did go in with
like crazy heavy hand maybe if I go in
with like two very soft coats I will
like it I don't know I think it might be
too clumpy for me but in the camera
intellectually it looks really pretty so
I don't know I feel
and then this reminded me I told you
guys earlier that I quit my no buy but I
forgot to tell you why okay sorry I'm
not hang on because my arm is hurting
like this so I decided to quit my no why
because I have to buy makeup base I just
I don't love only receiving PR and I
know that that may sound weird but I get
a lot of free makeup as you guys know a
lot of companies will send out PR to a
ton of influencers sometimes the makeup
is just too much for me and sometimes I
get so much but I give it to my friends
or I send it to my family in Cuba and
I'm always grateful for that and I know
I get a lot of makeup I like to buy my
own as well there are so many companies
out there that don't send PR they're
either smaller companies or just
companies I don't send PR and I like
buying from those breads because I like
to talk about all brands on my channel I
like to have the newest releases of
certain brands for example I recently
purchased
these these are the LA girl blushes the
camel is no blush is a computer for they
are this is like stunning packaging for
la girl
I mean it's plastic but I think it's
really nice and I get PR from them but
sometimes I don't sometimes I do is just
and they came out with these new I must
mesmerizing eyeshadows I'm going to so
old-school me do the old YouTube
handling these in the new I had a quad
squad gif quad and they look so
beautiful than it's very promising I got
aisles limited promising that was
extremely Cubana of me and very
promising I got this one and idolized
and this one in eternalized
and this one is my favorite I was
watching it earlier and look how
beautiful the lighting in here is
garbage but these are very very
pigmented they look so promising makeup
revolution came out with these triple
baked highlighters they look exactly
like the two-faced ones and they also
came out with triple based blusher like
this one looks identical to the
toothpaste one and I have a question
it's just legal I know
makeup revolution is known for duping
high-end brands and I'm all for that I'm
all for a drugstore alternative not
everyone wants to spend money on a
high-end brand but is this legal it's
almost exactly shame this is two-faced
this makes Pro Evolution okay you can
tell this one is the two-faced one and
this one is makeup revolution they're
very similar to makeup revolution one
looks a little peach here but this one
just applied a little smoother the
makeup revolution one which is slightly
more dry even though they look exactly
the same you can tell this one it's
better quality the toothpaste line
because these like to pick up packaging
falls out of these just be aware but I
am really excited to try these because I
don't think toothpaste has highlights
like this like this is amazing
speaking of highlights I got the new Too
Faced love light highlights we have two
colors they just send these to me this
one in blinded by the light is beautiful
it's the only one that's light enough
for my skin tone but it's that type of
highlight that doesn't feel like powder
it's a little bit more metallic looking
I know what you guys but I'm not into
like stripe highlight I want to find
anyone because I know a lot of people
are into that like really blinded
highlight and I love highlighting you
guys know I love highlighting but I
don't like it to look crazy like super
highlighted in one area how feeling this
is going to be like maybe a little bit
too much for me I have a feeling it's
going to emphasize like my texture I'm
not sure let me tell you another product
I'm like I don't have a good work
so recently on Sephora I hope you guys
don't mind this video I hope it's not
boring or annoying but I just feel like
I'm literally sitting on the floor
talking to my friend and trust me I have
been so stressed out I just need this I
need recently on the Sephora app if you
bought something of like $25 they throw
in this new Marc Jacobs recover
perfecting coconut setting mist so when
I heard about that promo I went on the
Sephora app and I bought something so
that I could get this but let me show
you I'm gonna be able to see it submit
the miss sucks on this it's like not
smooth and Shh feels kind of oily which
I kind of expected that because it is a
coconut setting miss witch and I end up
loving that about it cuz you guys know I
have really dry skin and I love the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mists and it
has that same texture I just cannot get
on war with the mist I think next she
throws me off maybe it's because it's a
mini mini dis big version will have a
different mess I'm not sure I can wash
it off again my gosh good camera heats
up every five minutes
you know what does have a really great
mist I just recently purchased it I do
get stuff sent to me from cover FX but
like I said sometimes they do sometimes
little so the cover FX illuminating
setting spray this has a good mix watch
watch do you hear that oh my god I think
this even has a better mist than my
Milani one it just goes for a really
long time watches like you see that I
love it I really really love the spritz
on this I always purchase some stuff
from health I'm going to give you a mini
alcohol okay so I picked up some of the
elf
fragrance free cleansing cloths I love
anything that says fragrance free on it
because I have very sensitive skin so I
can't wait to try this I think this is
brand new I have never seen it on the
website before I also picked up another
shade of the elf
lawless finish foundation I believe this
is a new shade addition to the rain and
it does look a little bit too late for
me maybe too yellowy but I think mixing
it in with the other flawless
foundations I have I might get a perfect
match
also I got another one of the tinted lip
oils in the shade nude kissed because
the one they sent me was broken and I
really wanted to try this color out I
gotta make sure this one's not broken
we're good
I saw this on the website and I thought
that that blush looked really beautiful
so I picked it up this is the perfect
face palette in smokey matte and this is
what it looks like doesn't that blush
look absolutely beautiful
that bronzer looks very promising and
then those three on the left are eye
shadows and then those two are lip
colors I got this elf hydrating water
sheet mask with purified water and aloe
recently I've been buying like
everything that has aloe in it because
it's just making such a difference in my
skin so I can only take time this sheet
mask I got both of the contour palettes
I got deep and the original one I think
they're deep one is noon I used to have
this one and I don't know where the heck
it is but I wanted to get this one
because you can take the colors out so I
want to customize it and make like my
own perfect contour palette then I got
this lipstick in the shade of blushing
brown this is the swatch it is beautiful
and then I just got this pointed powder
brush because I didn't own it and this
looked like it would be awesome for
bronzer okay so yeah I just wanted to
show you some of the stuff I recently
purchase or unless I recently got so
yeah I know if I totally went to the
garbage in terms of makeup I'm still on
a no buy in other aspects of my life but
when it comes to new releases for brands
don't send me PR I didn't want to
purchase them just so I can talk about
them on my channel I did right now I did
like a week it's pretty good right I
just don't want to only talk about free
makeup and don't everyone that doesn't
affect my opinion at all because you
don't think a little on my lengua when
it comes to how I feel about a product
if it's not of those ideas but whether I
bought it with or whether it ever freeze
but just constantly talking about free
makeup kind of leaves little bitter
taste in my mouth so I like to purchase
stuff and yeah back in with this video I
think I've talked long enough this
videos so long so let me know if you
like my random rambling videos it's kind
of like a series maybe of the sick one
a month out to sit here and talk crap
even though my last one was not a month
ago it was like last week but I promise
if I'm going to happen often I will give
you good content I guess that's it I
definitely need to wrap this video up
because I'm about to film an actual
video now so yeah thank you guys so much
for watching and that completes this
video I love you guys so much and yeah
I'll see you in my next one bye fluffy
hair like this Thanks look at where that
in my I hate to hang out there
