is going to be a little bit weird I'm
gonna be doing it a random room okay
I just woke up as you could probably
tell I look crazy but I'm thinking I'm
gonna be posting a random rambles video
today which is probably why this video
is going up so late I was trying to film
a video yesterday for today but the
construction was so loud and it did not
stop I couldn't film and then I felt so
bad so I thought when I woke up today I
was like you know what what if I did a
random rambles of my day I'm not very
fun
I don't do fun things at all I barely
leave my house but I thought maybe a
random rambles was better than nothing
honestly guys with this Hokkaido
polished thing I didn't know was gonna
be as much as it is I didn't know how
crazy that was gonna be and it's my
brand so I'm very involved that
sometimes it's hard to film and I've
told you guys 100 times I don't want to
repeat this story over and over again
but yesterday we had construction issues
so today oh and she doesn't it um it's
gonna be a simple day I'm actually
waiting for my sister-in-law Becky to
get here because I haven't worked out in
two months because Becky and I
my sister-in-law we always work out
together like that's just what we do I
don't work out unless I'm working out
with Becky because I really have no
willpower I will say I need to work out
with someone in order to be motivated to
work out because I hate it I hate it I
hate exercising but I know it's very
important for our body so my brother's
kids have been out of school you know
summer break and Johnny and Becky have
three kids so she couldn't come over
with them during the summer to work out
like she could come over with them to
hang out but we would try to work out it
was just it was too much so we kind of
put a pause on working out until school
started up again and school is
officially back and today is my first
day back working out which I'm afraid I
feel like all my muscle has left all the
little muscle I had is gone and I feel
like I'm a weakling now so hopefully my
like my right now my arm is on fire from
hoping this camera but yeah that's
basically what I'm gonna be doing right
now I also have to declutter one of my
drawers so maybe you guys can help me
declutter that but anyway I just woke up
and brush my teeth I'm gonna go wash my
face and have breakfast and stuff and
yeah I'll see you guys in a minute
all right time back so I just finished
working out like two hours ago I took a
shower and stuff and I came into my
guest bedroom to get away from the chaos
bed for my little friend
I mean knows she's only allowed to get
stopped I mean no she's only about to
get on the bed in the guest room this is
like my old bed do you guys remember
this bed this is my old bedroom set from
when Danny and I first got married like
almost seven years ago and I've been
wanting to redo the guest bedroom but I
don't want to get rid of my furniture I
have this weird thing I'm like attached
to old pieces and old things that I had
before I started YouTube it's like a
weird thing and I can't get rid of it I
don't know
I'm so tired today I think it's because
I haven't worked out in so long and my
body's not used to it and I actually
have to go to my friend Jesse's house
who just had a baby I went to go see her
in the hospital but I haven't seen the
baby since he's been born like at their
house so I'm actually gonna go do that
in a little while and then I'll come
back home and edit this crap and put it
on the Internet oh by the way I have a
new shirt Vaughn this is my John bender
sure from The Breakfast Club
I just got it I'm pretty sure I got this
at Urban Outfitters or at forever 21 I'm
not sure I have an addiction to graphic
tees or things like this and I love this
like how epic is this sure plus I got my
starry night my starry night sucks which
is my favorite painting in the world got
them socks out so I'm super fashionable
today oh my gosh I have to declutter
that drawer I completely forgot I'm
gonna do that now and actually have the
cutest little two-faced PR package to
show you yeah let's go do that
look at this it's a lollipop I was
actually waiting for you guys to open it
so that I can open it on camera
ignore my hair okay I'm letting it air
dry
but look at this I have never been more
excited to get up here if I guess ever
ever
if you don't know Kennedy Johnson is one
of the best most amazing creatures on
this planet now I have met a lot of
youtubers in my day okay a lot of them
but no one no one is as sweet as candy
Johnson I met her for the first time at
Jenn Beauty last year and she was still
sir-sir she was so nice to me so
welcoming like if she knew me her whole
life I swear she treated me like she
knew her life and I'm just so awkward
when I'm meeting people like so weird I
thought she was just amazing look at
this beauty look at this beauty so happy
she collab with Too Faced you get a I
want candy limited edition
candy scented and it knows Kansas oh
this is so cute look at this it has
candy Johnson like right there look how
cute this palette is on my wish oh my
gosh comes little it's a paper on the
inside alright so that was driving me
nuts
anyway I cannot wait to clear it on with
this I who love candy Johnson so much oh
I was so excited for this this is the I
want candy banana pudding it's a
brightening face powder and it looks
look at this cute a little partner dream
they loaded this is no big banana oh my
god wait okay I don't think it smells
like bananas but it kind of smells like
something familiar I think this would
look really nice underneath the eyes it
looks really crazy yellow on camera but
it's lighter in person oh and smell
these oh you know what I think it smells
like I think it smells like their
original cocoa like that vanilla cocoa
with a hint of sweetness I don't think
it necessarily smells like candy I doll
I don't really smell but what does candy
smell like if you think about it I get a
Luminizer and then you get a black
licorice liquid eyeliner so it's like a
face highlight and this one this is like
a liquid liner so cute so cute and me
candy glow Luminizer supposedly this
smells like candy as well take highlight
that is such a pretty color can you see
that it looks like it might be a little
too pigmented for my skin tone this
feels like this blends out like a dream
and then you get five liquefied matte
long-wear lip sticks they're liquid lip
this a 5/5 please supposed oh holy crap
this smells like marshmallows understood
I was like my kind of smells like their
original stuff
really smell the candy that much but
this smells better this smells amazing I
want to eat this this smells like old
school like old school lip smackers the
marshmallow lip smacker that's what this
oh my god that's that's amazing and then
you get a four liquid lipstick so you
get a berry one a nude one a red one and
then kind of like a mommy one so this
one is called the freshly baked oh my
god I think this is such a candy Johnson
color oh my god these swatches are gonna
be so pointless this one is called
tropical punch like this is also such a
candy shade then we have melted ice
cream and wrote the name of that one
this would look so pretty with like a
deeper lip gloss on top you can't even
see that it's very light video song and
oh they smell the same as the highlight
kind of smell like the marshmallow
fireside candles from Bath and Body
Works I know it sounds crazy but they
kind of do oh I love this color this one
is called sweet and sour I thought it
was gonna be like more red but it is a
stunning like corally orange --red those
beautiful I love all of these shapes let
me tell you I love everything you're not
having tried anything yet
congratulations candy Johnson now I have
to go through that damn drawer or has
been calling my name for days it's like
thee colet of me please please do that
okay it's this drawer which I've already
gone through like a whole makeup slash
video I kind of had a pause on makeup
such videos I will continue then I
changed the knobs and I know that it
doesn't look match with everything right
now but as I change my room up they will
eventually match my room but anyway look
at this oh my god I have accumulated
more settings phrase and more powders
like in the last couple months
it's insane so I I can't I can't I can't
deal with this so I'm gonna take
everything out look at this weirdo swing
what are you doing I'm gonna take
everything out of the drawer okay so
these are all my setting sprays and
these are all my face powders this is
ridiculous so I'm gonna go through all
the settings brace first this is the
cover FX mattifying setting spray I'm
gonna hold on to this just because I
really don't have that many mattifying
settings raising you
know when you're gonna need it and I
love coverfx this is the rent flash
defense anti-pollution mist I never
forget use this I J I I never use this
the picky picky huh the pixie hydrating
milky mists is one of my favorites I
have to hold on to this this is the milk
makeup blur spray I actually don't
really like this it just makes my face
feel really weird I'll go into more
detail in my setting spray video which
is why I'm gonna get rid of it but I'm
gonna hold on to it but I don't love
this that's going in the no pile what in
wild setting spray it's a must it's so
good keeping I love this skin Inc pure
serum mist I think it's really amazing
and this is the small travel spray I
have like the big one right up there
so of course I'm keeping a little bit
the Scandinavia setting sprays are some
of the best setting sprays in my opinion
this is the primer and the finishing
setting spray so I'm keeping them both
getting rid of this project beauty spray
set go I just I don't love the mist on
this and I have other setting sprays I
like more I mean do it do I have to say
anything like do I have to this is a new
one I just recently picked up and it was
like an arm and a leg so I'm gonna hold
on to it this is from Lila B it's the
after go face mist it's very very
similar to the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mess which I'm almost completely out of
but these two are very very similar
they're also very similar in price so
I'm gonna hang on to both of these the
glam glow glow setter is a new setting
spray that I haven't even used yet I
know I'm awful so I am gonna hold onto
this this Marc Jacobs recover perfecting
coconut setting mist is garbage now that
it's garbage it's just the sprayer on
this sucks it just throw I hate it and
when a spray sucks this bad I can't even
enjoy the inside it just puts spots all
over my face it's not good
I've been trying out the Catrice prime
and fine multi-talent fixing spray and
so far so good I've been using it a ton
so I think I really like it I think I'm
gonna like I'm gonna hold on to it this
is the Smashbox primer water I think it
might be a little bit of a gimmick but
I'm gonna keep it just in case I'm gonna
pass on the fast and fabulous makeup
setting spray setting spray from heart
candy because I really really like this
one this is
the hard candy sheer envy hydrating
primer mist it says primer miss but I
find that it works as a primer and as a
setting spray I don't really use the
other one so I like this one from hard
candy and I'm holding onto it it's
really really good these Urban Decay
like setting sprays and like all the
stuff the b6 the quick fix the all night
of the chill these are really really
great they're made by Scandinavia so I'm
gonna hold onto all of them except this
one this is the this is the quick fix
this is kind of like a primer spray but
I never even touch this I prefer the b6
over this one it's just I don't know has
like coconut water in it but it really
doesn't do much for me so I'm gonna get
rid of that one and I'm gonna keep these
three I've been testing and loving the
Too Faced hangover RX 3 and run like
face mist I love it as a primer like
right before putting on my foundation it
works really well so I'm keeping that
I'm over it I'm over it I'm or Zeeland
where is it
oh I'm over it I'm over it I'm over mac
fix+ and these are super old I got them
like three years ago it's a lavender and
like a coconut I'm just I don't want it
this is the Milani make it dewy setting
spray and I have to be honest I don't
like this nearly as much as the make it
last setting spray so I'm passing that
one along another one I'm getting rid of
is the Al Genest splash hydrating
setting mist it's really amazing don't
get me wrong great for hydrating but I
have so many that already do that so I'm
just gonna pass this one I love this
pixie glow miss mainly as like a priming
spray it works really well perfect for
dry skin I'm gonna hold on to that this
is the glow getter mist from the brand
wander I bought this in a little set and
I used it once didn't fall in love and I
just I don't know I don't use it oh this
is brand-new this is the Ben Nye file
seal I just recently got this because I
hear this is like the most intense
setting spray in the world so I got this
little size so that I could use it just
for special occasions I don't like this
it's really bulky it doesn't do much
it's from pretty vulgar it's their
setting spray and it's it just looks
honestly it does nothing for me I use
this in place of my mac fix+
this is the makeup revolution aqua
priming base I use this for pigment for
some reason I just really really like
this for that so yeah I don't know why I
don't like it but I know it just I just
don't like it it does nothing for me the
spray is weird it's I just I don't get
it
this is the Kat Von D lock-it makeup
setting mist I
and tried this enough to say like oh I
don't like it or oh my gosh I love it so
I'm gonna hold on to it just to try it
out a little bit more this I don't
really use this is the pharmacy skin do
it has really great ingredients and all
of that but I just don't use it so I'm
gonna pass that along and then last but
not least this is the morphe prep and
set makeup setting spray I'm almost
completely out of this it's amazing it
has like a continuous spray it's just so
fine it's incredible so of course I'm
keeping it okay so these are all the
setting sprays I'm saying bye bye - and
then let's go through these powders this
is that pixie powder used in a recent
video I used it a few more times after
that video and I truly just don't love
it have powders that are way better than
this so I'm skipping this I cannot get
rid of the NYC smooth skin powder it's
so affordable and it's so good this is
the Laura Mercier translucent loose
setting powder I don't know how this
ended up in my collection again because
I'm pretty sure I recently decluttered
this but I'm gonna pass this along
because I have a mini version of it
already
I mean do I have to say it of course I'm
keeping this it's my favorite I've
really been liking this new Too Faced
Born This Way powder it has a little bit
of a sheen to it so it's great on those
days where my skin is looking a little
flat so I'm gonna hold on to this I love
it the RMS Beauty unpowered is so weird
in the best way possible it's the
smoothest powder in my collection it's
like I can't even describe the feeling
of this it's definitely add a powder you
do get a little bit of flashback with
this but it's incredible you know I was
really into this powder for a long time
this is the Fionna Stiles invisible
finish powder just I don't know I have
other powders I like more so I'm gonna
pass that along for example like this
this is the new glossier powder
this is my new go-to powder it's
incredible and the packaging it's really
great oh my god I spoke about this in a
recent haul this is from the brand Lila
B and this is a face powder and like the
coolest packaging ever of course I'm
keeping it it's so cool this is the
cookie translucent setting powder I
think it's really good but I don't want
to hold on to something that I don't
really use and ever since I used it in
that video I don't really reach for it
the same goes for this this is the
Natasha's anona invisible HD face powder
I just use my other loose face powders
more than this so I'm going to pass it
the cozened oh my
paunchy natural lighting powder is
something that's really weird but I kind
of love it I don't know I just I'm not
ready to go this is the Armani luminous
silk compact even though I don't like
the luminous silk foundation that much I
love the compact so yes I'm keeping I'm
also keeping the cover effects loose
powder it's just too good to give up
this is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
powder I obviously don't use this one
it's too dark for me and this is like a
yellow one and this one's translucent
they're really good I just don't reach
for them so I'm gonna I'm gonna give I'm
gonna give them all away
I love Pacifica but this mineral
neutralizing modifier is too pink on my
skin and you can really really see it so
I cannot use that so something that was
ridiculously overpriced
this is the LA Prairie cellular
treatment foundation um this was
expensive and I don't think it's as good
as it should be with that price tag so
I'm gonna give this one to my mother
this is the Laura Mercier candle glow
shear perfecting powder and I love it
now we have these let's try to go
through these really fast
Katrice perm and fine modifier I love it
will not get rid of it I also love this
Milani prep set and glow this is oh my
god no I love this this stuff is so good
this is the Kat Von D lock-it blotting
powder yeah the sea race is your pores
it is amazing I also really love these
sure I don't need this many powders but
I can't help it
this is the Charlotte Tilbury powder the
airbrush one I love it
I'm gonna get rid of this H&amp;amp;M powder
just because it is so light even when on
my natural skin color so I like it
underneath the eyes but I just don't use
it anymore
this is the NARS translucent crystal
powder I used to love it but honestly I
don't even use it that much anymore be
cover FX pressed powder in light I
really really like it I'm keeping it
this is the maybelline superstay better
skin powder you want to use this a
little bit more I feel like I haven't
used it enough so I'm gonna hang on to
that the NYX finishing powder is really
really great for underneath the eyes I
really love it I also really love this
elf powder
it doesn't really have a name it just
has finishing powder but I really like
it you guys remember this this was like
my Holy Grail powder for a long time
this is the Maybelline fit me in 1/35
creamy natural wow man I haven't used
this in forever I don't even think they
make this shade anymore so I'm gonna get
I can't believe I'm saying that I love
this powder it's the Wet n Wild photo
focused press powder it is so natural
and so beautiful this is the Too Faced
cocoa powder foundation I feel like I
haven't given this a fair shot so I'm
gonna hold onto it and use it a little
bit more I don't really use this la girl
pro face powder nearly enough as I
should so I'm going to I'm going to
pause that also gonna get rid of this
one just because I keep it for the
packaging but I don't really use it this
is the Too Faced primed and poreless if
I'm gonna use a poor Fillies either
gonna be my Kat Von D one or my bye bye
pores for make cosmetics which I'm also
keeping these are all the powders I'm
getting rid of I wanted to get rid of a
little bit more but you know sometimes
my body cannot oh I also have these
hourglass powders which I will never hit
home I love hourglass powders so yeah
guys this is it on my setting sprays and
on my powders the drawer looks so much
better now I feel like I can breathe now
it was just way too cluttered
this is everything I'm getting rid of
and yeah it feels good it feels good
okay so I think I'm gonna wrap up this
video here I hope this video was
