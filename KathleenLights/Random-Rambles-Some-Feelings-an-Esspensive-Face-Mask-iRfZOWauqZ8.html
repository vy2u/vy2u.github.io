normal video only a friend you can tell
they is going to be a random ramble
video actually how I posted one of these
in a while so I thought I should and I
have the craziest month of July I know I
mentioned this already a few times in my
videos but I'm actually doing a lot of
traveling there's a lot of work I have
to do this month usually all of my time
is dedicated to YouTube or Kol polish
and I'm so grateful to work from home
but there's a lot of stuff going on this
month which puts such a damper on my
filming schedule and I hate
disappointing my subscribers but
sometimes when my schedule is really
crazy it's almost impossible to film so
please bear with me for July the entire
month is really crazy so I thought maybe
I can throw in a random rambles video
because today is technically my editing
day I have a lot of editing to do I'm
actually going to do that but I'm done
with my rebel video so this is kind of
like a mini vlog today Danny actually is
at a baseball game and I couldn't go
because I had so much editing to do but
before I start editing I actually have
to do my hair a bit because I have a
meeting tomorrow so that's actually what
I'm doing right now and I decided to
just put the camera on and talk to you
guys while I do my hair I hope you don't
mind I know some people don't like these
kinds of videos they prefer my beauty
videos and trust me I do too I love
beauty videos but I know there are a lot
of you who do like vlog style videos or
more laid-back more personal videos this
is the thing I use to part my hair it's
like an opened hair click or like bobby
pin thing and I use that part my hair by
the way I know my recent videos have
been pretty chatty and again I apologize
for that I just have a lot going on
right now so my videos are a little all
over the place but I promise we will get
back to it and hair always looks cute
until I brush it so anyway I really
wanted to talk to you guys because I
feel like I've gotten to this point on
YouTube where I really don't know what
people like watching I mean I've been
doing this for four years already and I
pretty much have been doing
same thing for the last four years and
it's things I just really enjoy doing
even though I've been doing them for
years you know I really love favorites
videos I'll make up tutorials I love
China get ready as I love the classic
YouTube videos people used to post back
in the day and I feel like now YouTube
has become something totally different
at least in the beauty community cynic
videos now are all about the shock
factor like what clickbait is better or
what title will draw you in more unless
your title is something like kind of a
Jenner lipstick melted in my face skin
off unless it's a title like that or
something like videos tend to struggle
now it's just crazy
don't get me wrong I still do videos I
still continue to love them I'm still
going to continue to make them because
those are the videos that make me happy
I like the og YouTube I like the classic
videos that may piss people off but I
don't want to be a clone of every other
Beauty influencer and I'm not saying
that to be rude and I don't mean a
physical clone I'm not trying to attack
anybody physical appearance I still want
to be a channel people enjoy watching
but I also want to post content that's
true to who I am and true to my
personality and what I love you know I'm
the beauty community is truly changing
and I don't I don't know if I love the
change I I'm trying to be more accepting
of change because my entire life have
always been someone who really jaded
change or just they're not to adapt to
it and I'm trying to be more open about
it because nothing is the same forever
things change people change and I would
really just love to know your guys's
opinion I'm sure a lot of you guys are
subscribed to multiple YouTube channels
obviously not just mine and I would love
to know your opinion by the way I did
use heat protectant on my hair before I
sat down to film the video so there is
he predicted in my hair but I would love
to know that your opinion on what I'm
talking about
like do I need to get with the times
because I do feel like I'm a little bit
more old school than I should be I don't
know I just like to be myself and I like
to do my own thing which is why I am so
private and I know that's very
frustrating for a lot of people but I
just preferred that way all of us have
struggles that we go through internally
we all have family troubles relationship
troubles it's okay to deal with things
on your own time at your own pace and
not have to have thousands and thousands
of opinions you stuff so I'm very to
myself I know a lot of you guys
understand that about me but anyway
definitely meet your opinions down below
what you want to see from me what kind
of videos you want to see I know ask you
guys to leave this all the time there
are always new faces here on my channel
so definitely always always request
videos feel free to always give me your
thoughts on what you want me to get them
you just have so much anxiety this week
flying gets me so nervous and you would
think after flying so many times already
but I would get used to it but I really
I don't know if I will ever get used to
it I force myself to because you cannot
let your fears stop you from living your
life and it's something I struggle with
every day I feel like it's gotten worse
as I got an older I have a lot of fears
of so many things and flying is one of
them and find them on them and I tell
myself like it's okay it's okay
I hate throwing your pity parties for
myself I used to do that all the time
and I realized what that job was making
me even more miserable I used to tell
myself all the time like oh I must be
crazy I must be crazy and then the more
I would tell myself that like the more I
believed it
and no you cannot be like that you have
to tell yourself like calm down if you
feel like you're on the verge of a panic
attack and that happens to me a lot I
start to mentally tell myself like okay
calm down you're going to be okay
breathe breathing techniques help so
much a lot of people make fun of
breathing techniques but Samantha came
over the other day and we were in the
back yard and she was teaching me these
breathing techniques from a man maybe
you guys have heard of him before he's
like this guy who can sit in ice or like
really really really cold water and he
sustains that like physical torture with
his breathing techniques and how
breathing is very very important and
it's so crazy but we were doing those
breathing techniques in the backyard
like certain like this certain technique
she learned and I felt so good when we
were done I almost felt like I was a
little drunk I'm not going to lie like
when you do those techniques and you're
breathing so much and you're really
focusing on your
and inhaling and exhaling if you do that
for a while you feel so then you feel so
relaxed it's like your mind calms down
your body comes down it is it is
incredible and I've been trying to learn
more breathing techniques because it's
really really been helping me honestly
every single day this month since this
month started I have woken up with
anxiety and I just I don't know how to
take that away because I wake up with
the anxiety and what is causing it I'm
sleeping you know so crazy okay so my
friend was shut off the temperature was
too high on my camera so it shut off and
I just finished doing the rest of my
hair because I was taking forever
talking to you guys and doing my hair
anyway so just finished my hair I wanted
to show you guys this is the heat
protectant I always use this is the
alternate multi vitamin C protecting
spray it has vitamin A b6 b12 C II and
it has biotin as well I really love this
and I never never do my hair without
this guy I am obsessed with this and a
little GU such a long way i uses every
time i wash my hair and i'm only like
right here i love this and just do one
little pump go like this and then i
distribute it at the end of my hair and
this is the marula intensive hair
treatment and styling oil it's silicone
free color space and it changed frizz
and repairs strands I love using this
the most when my hair is natural like
what have it curly or wavy because it
really does change the frizz so yeah I'm
actually going to be editing all day
which still it Lisa
I rather film than edit but somebody's
got to do it but I really suck at
editing I'm not really good at using
final cut at all anyway before I get
started on editing and actually going to
do a face mask let me take you to my
bathroom really quickly show you
something okay so I gotta make a mess
please excuse Danny's work pants and
work boots you know how many times I
tell him about the leak like why why
what's why do you work a spoiler but
anyway I really wanted to show you that
I just recently got this in the mail and
I was love
to know what you guys think of this this
is a face mask from the brand ChaCha
I love everything about this brand I
love their packaging they are a very
very very very pricey brand it's a more
luxurious skin care line so if you're
not into luxury skincare or luxury
period you might not like this brand I
truly love it I don't really like luxury
skincare to be honest well I mean if you
consider drunk elephant luxury do you
besides that like Lancome and all those
other skincare brand I don't love but I
do love ChaCha and this is the by
Lafitte radiance mask and I've never
tried it before and I think I'm gonna
try it right now and just keep it on my
face while I'm editing my hand it stirs
but it says it has brightening beauty
berry and dual vitamin C it's also for
all skin types you're supposed to apply
a generous layer to clean skin avoid
your eyes and rinse after 15 minutes
okay so I just washed my face and let's
try this out because I am so intrigued
with how much is this process brilliant
it is a $68 mask I haven't even checked
it on Sephora but it has 23 reviews so
far and it has 5 stars
so mostly this by the way I'm filming
this entire video on my vlogging camera
so I'm sorry for that my regular Beauty
videos do not have a filter on them just
these random ramble so this is what the
mask looks like it's such a pretty like
violet purple shade I love it and it
doesn't really smell like anything
your smell doesn't little time I'm going
to take this fresh masking spatula thing
to apply our face mask and we are just
going to dive right and it says to apply
a generous amount so that's what I'm
going to do
oh when I go over a spot it like takes
it off so we'll see
okay so we have to leave this on for 15
minutes and we will see how my skin
looks it's supposed to be an anti-aging
mask packs with Japanese Beauty very
like I said and I had a chaise from
seven fruits that in veil softer glowing
skin and it's supposed to help dullness
and uneven texture which texture is an
issue that I deal with and it's supposed
to help with dark spots and uneven skin
tones fine lines and wrinkles basically
that sounds like a miracle frigging
masks so hopefully I like it and
hopefully it doesn't irritate my kid but
while I let s turn on my face I was
going to go edit right now but I didn't
a little bit I don't want to finish this
video I wanted to show you a couple of
things that I feel like I can't really
show you in my beauty videos because
they don't it just doesn't fall under
anything like I'm going to have time to
talk about that but I have been using
the Rodan and fields and hashman
attachments no enhancements lash boost I
purchased this because my friend Laura
from mrs. lovell in here on YouTube was
raving about this she was telling me
that it made a huge difference on her
lashes and I immediately went out and
bought it because I tried lash theorems
in the past I forgot the name of the one
I use it they just called lash Envy now
one really irritated my eyes I don't
know why but it made them really red
kind of itchy so I stopped using that
and this is the only one that doesn't
irritate my eyes and Laura was telling
me if I remember correctly that this
company spent like two years on this
lash serum just so they made sure that
it didn't change your eye color some
serum to do that and just one doesn't do
that they put it through like the
ultimate tests and I really have been
enjoying it I've been using it for an
entire month and I think I see a
difference in my lashes have you didn't
noticed if my lashes look a little bit
longer these days I mean I have been
using my L'Oreal lash paradise mascara
which is I think the best mascara at the
drugstore I love it but I think it's a
combination of this lash boost out of
how crazy I made the mistake of not
taking a before picture but I mean you
know your body or your lashes I
definitely see them longer than they
were a month and a half ago so
I don't know I just went to the Rodan
and Fields website and I purchased it
and I don't know if any of you are
interested in making your lashes longer
but if you are I think you would really
like this buy lace my shirt is just like
permanently stained all things to Celine
just in case you're like mm you sure
it's dirty yes okay anyway my face is
starting to dry now it's like super
sticky so I'm going to continue to leave
this on for the remainder of the
timeline and we will discuss it I will
let you know my initial first impression
face masks are hard for me I have to use
them like three or four times before I
can tell you what I really think but I
save you my first impression sure why
not
okay I'll better I forgot to mention
excuse me I forgot to mention that I
also wanted to show you this Marc Jacobs
beauty actually sent over their entire
lip gloss range practicing like this
totally freaked me out going how do I
turn these off look like every time yeah
no there's no button nothing okay anyway
thank you so much to Marc Jacobs for
sending me these lip glosses
I love the emerge a-cups lip glosses so
much they're one of the best formulas I
love the book someone filter my holy
grail lip glosses
I like those more than the Marc Jacobs
ones for sure but I really do love these
Marc Jacobs ones would you guys be
interested in a lip swatch video on all
of these Marc Jacobs lip glosses
definitely let me know I go back to my
original statement when I first started
this video and have to be honest lip
swatch videos do not get a lot of views
at all nobody is interested in those
anymore but I love those kinds of videos
and that's what started my channel like
my first video ever was a lip swatch
video please don't feel bad if you don't
want to see that video like comment
below like no girl I do not want to see
a Marc Jacobs lip gloss swatch video at
all that will never offend me your
opinion will never offend me unless
you're like mean about it but
constructive criticism is always always
welcome here so let me know if you want
to see it or if you don't because I'm
cool with books now I'm going to go wash
this stuff off my face alright sir I
just wipe the mask and I think I'm
really going to like this mask I can't
really see a difference right now but I
did notice that my
and I don't know how to explain it but
right before it's put on this face mask
my skin didn't feel this soft it's very
so I definitely noticed that and I also
kind of noticed that my skin looks a
little brighter like just a little more
luminous but nothing too major I think
this is going to be the kind of face
mask you're going to have to use
consecutively to see a noticeable
difference but so far so good
anyway definitely let me know what you
think of this face mask down below if
you have tried it get a sample at
Sephora and then let me know what you
think and yeah I have to go edit guys
I'm going to wrap up this video but I am
going to go eat something because I am
starving so I'm going to sit in my
backyard enjoy some lunch and hang out
with the dogs for like 20 minutes and
then I will edit for the rest of the day
so kind of you guys that completes this
random rambles video thank you so much

haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye so we do we but we do be
