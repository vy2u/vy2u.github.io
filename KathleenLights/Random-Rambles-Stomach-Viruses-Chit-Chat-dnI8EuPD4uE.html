random rambles kind of video I'm sorry
that's today I'm not putting up an
actual beauty video I've had quite a
week
I had quite the week if you don't follow
me on social media I'm here to update
you I'm gonna put my camera on my
Twitter I am currently in the bathroom
of my Beauty room this is my shower
curtain and I purchased it at Urban
Outfitters it's they are elephants
anyway so I wanted to update you guys
the crazy thing is that I knew I was
going to have a really crazy April like
I have so many things happening in April
especially now since having kale polish
I'm very grateful and I'm so thankful
for you guys and I am so grateful to
have my own brand and doing something
that I really love but balancing kale
polish and YouTube and life in general
is a struggle since I post three times a
week and I don't want to stop posting
three times a week sometimes things get
in the way like terrible terrible
stomach moves you guys know Amelia I
mean here's my best friend Amelia's
daughter Zoe was like throwing up on
Sunday and she was at my house and we
didn't know what she had was like
contagious or like a stomach virus we
didn't know she took her to a hospital
but they didn't tell her it was anything
contagious or anything like that but I'm
Tuesday morning like at 1:30 in the
morning I got up like I just woke up and
I had to run to the bathroom and they
fill up my entire life I was throwing up
once every 40 minutes like it wouldn't
even hit 40 minutes sometimes and I
would have to get up to run and throw up
again now was happening all night until
finally I was able to go to Urgent Care
like at 9:00 in the morning and not only
was I throwing up Oh
going up out of other places as well I
know that sounds disgusting that is way
too much information and obviously after
so many times of throwing up and the
other stuff your body will get
dehydrated walking to the toilet I was
getting so dizzy I was like falling over
I was so dehydrated and the che part is
that Danny woke up like at 5:00 in the
morning that same day with vomiting like
he had gotten it - so you're both like
in bed like oh I mean I had it way worse
I was throwing up constantly storm on
man in the morning he was like you know
what I can drive let's go to Urgent Care
and then when I got there I fiddle up
two more times like it was it was really
bad but I'm not going to get into detail
because you guys did start throwing up
it was horrific and we were there for a
few hours and asked
you know the IV and the medication I
felt like a million dollars like I swear
I was feeling worse because I was so
dehydrated and then we left the urgent
care and we stayed in bed for the rest
of the day because we were still like
pretty weak and my stomach was killing
me and even though I had stopped
vomiting I didn't stop like the other
stuff the other stuff is still happening
and I'm feeling so much better now I
just want to say thank you guys so much
because you guys were commenting such
nice things thank you probably get well
wishes I really really appreciate it
reading through the comments I was just
feeling so much better because I was
feeling like crap and even though it's
been like two days that happened to me
on Tuesday today's Thursday I still have
like a sensitive stomach just want this
to be over because I'm actually having a
party tomorrow or my spring nail
polishes avoid to detail in a second but
I posted it on Instagram but my spring
nail collection officially launches
April 12 it has been a journey it has
been a journey but we are finally
launching April 12 I'm so excited but
tomorrow I'm actually throwing a party
it's not like a blog or event and all
the bloggers live in California anyway
but it's not something that I'm doing
for networking or anything I'm literally
throwing a party for my friends and my
family like just for all of us to get
together and just celebrate this
milestone with me and yeah but I've been
planning it for months literally months
now and I don't want to feel like this
tomorrow
yeah I just quickly wanted to update you
guys because obviously there wasn't a
video of on Wednesday and this is why
well yeah we're pretty much going to
talk about nothing and just hang out
together because I like filming this
video sometimes I'm actually waiting for
my mom to get here because she has to
Diamond roots they look in a little clay
crate and I want to have my room side
obviously for the party and have to do
my nails they feel crazy and it's going
to be really cute because all my friends
are wearing a color to my party tomorrow
and I'm going to wear Saint Claire
because that's my favorite one in the
spring line and I'm wearing like a peach
dress and I think that the peach dress
would look really cute with st. Claire
I'll probably be snapping at the party
if you follow me on snapchat
I never snapshot honestly guys I'm the
world's worst social media person I just
picked caught up in so many other things
that I really don't think about some app
chatting I really don't do anything
super interesting I mean most of the
time I stay home I am a huge homebody I
don't really like to leave my house much
but those are issues I'm working on but
if you do follow me on snapchat I
probably
we'll be snapping my party tomorrow well
today if you're watching this one I'm
poofing it and yeah I'm just waiting for
my one to get here so she could die my
root okay so I don't know when the heck
my mom's getting here but I always like
to talk about really random things in
these videos by the way I'm in my closet
of the beady room I never let anybody in
here because if you saw this place it's
it's quite embarrassing it's almost as
bad as Monica's secret closet in friends
almost of that I have so much junk
industry I really have to do like an
epic spring cleaning
there's stuff literally everywhere by
the way this is like one of those
steepest tree things also has elephants
I also got that Urban Outfitters
and this is a Garden State poster from
the movie it is my favorite movie of all
time and yeah I have a little poster
like on my wall and I love it because
right here on the bottom it says by the
way it sends balls on your face and I
love that quote movie said now my
beloved dry shampoo is this guy right
here the Nirvana black but I recently
purchased it because I bought so many
good reviews on this this is the way dry
shampoo not the new foaming one I think
this one is also new though just a
regular dry shampoo and the reason I
want to talk to you guys about this
today is because if you are buying this
to clean your hair like if you are going
to buy this one for the same reason you
would use this one because this black
one it really it sucks up all the oils
my hair feels so clean when I use this
this this is a texturizer I don't know
why it's labeled dry shampoo I mean sure
it does soak up some oil but honestly it
just gives you a lot of texture
I went in pretty heavy-handed with this
without knowing that because the great
thing about this is that there is no
white cast but don't apply too much
because you won't even be able to run
your hands through your hair I was
literally shocked
there were first time I used this it
made my roots so gritty I really did not
like it but it gave my hair so much
volume that I was like wow this could be
awesome for those of you really really
want volume so a part of me doesn't like
this another part of me kind of thing I
mean I mostly don't like it but this
would be really nice for like those
beachy waves to add a little bit of
texture in your hair then this is really
good for that
and yeah okay I'll talk to you guys in a
little bit all right I have to wash this
off now I'm going to sign my roof I was
going to show you guys what I used I get
a lot of questions about my hair dye and
I thought I brought it into the bathroom
to show you but I didn't so I'll show
you after okay so just out of the shower
so I used this one from the brand matrix
it's the so color line and I get mine in
the shade 8a b and i purchased this on
salon centric calm
my mom always just gets them for me
because she has her cosmetology license
so she buys the majority of her stuff on
salon centric calm and then she just
died my roots and look how crazy this is
a V which stands for ash violet I
believe I have to use ash violet because
if I don't my hair literally comes out
copper my hair pulls very very red
naturally which I'm okay with now like I
used to hate it when I was younger but
I'm totally okay with now I think my
hair is pretty more maz it is and yeah I
used to do a joy cool color but now I do
matrix so yeah I'm going to go do my
toes and my hands for the party and then
I'll show you the color I want to do a
coconut milk on my toes I know a lot of
people hate to mix and match but as in
that hair I'm going to do coconut milk
on my toes I'm going to do st. clair on
my hands okay so it's really late at
night and I wanted to show you my hands
this is st. Claire for some reason it
looks much more blue on camera like in
person it's kind of like a Cinderella
periwinkle but on camera is looking like
more summery a broken nail and I said
are these are my beauties right here I'm
going to do an entire video dedicated to
the spring line I'm going to show you
swatches and we're going to talk about
the names and all that good stuff I just
wanted to show you them just laying here
and I'm not showing you my face because
I look a lot mess right now I'm
currently taking off my mustache with my
Sally Hansen like face hair remover
thing so I'm about to jump into bed I
just wanted to quickly say good night
and I wanted to show you my nails and
yes
