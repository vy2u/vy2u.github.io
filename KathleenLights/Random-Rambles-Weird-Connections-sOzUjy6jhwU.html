today's video is gonna be a random
rambles video I just have a lot going on
this week and I am pre recording I know
I say that all the time feel like I
always have a lot going on but not
exactly sure when this video is going up
and on November 22nd Danny and I make
seven years of marriage which is insane
to me
we've been married seven years on
November 22nd what and we're actually
gonna be going out of town for a couple
of days to celebrate our anniversary so
I have to pay record for that and then
on the 23rd it's Thanksgiving which
actually I was looking at the calendar
and next year manniversary lands on
Thanksgiving we're actually just gonna
go out to dinner for our anniversary get
a couples massage and go out to dinner
don't go video earlier today and I just
spent like hours editing it and I was
supposed to film another video now but
I'm just so tired and ready for bed but
I thought I would sit down and talk to
you guys for a little bit before I do
you guys like my frame here I'm actually
gonna be hanging this on my wall
do you guys know when I film tutorials
or get ready with me videos I always
foam in front of my desk not my vanity
and you know how I have all those frames
like scattered behind me on the wall
well I'm gonna take some of those frames
out I'm gonna move things around like
I've been sitting for 18 months trying
to change my room around and get really
inspired to film new videos and just to
change things up going into the new year
I'm gonna be putting this on the wall I
think it'll look really cool with like a
couple frames around it which by the way
if you have no idea what this is this is
a water-bearer I got this on society6
comm I love that website I got a bunch
of stuff there they're really cool stuff
and they have like this Zodiac
collection I think if you go on the
website and go on society6 and type in
Aquarius gold you'll see from hippota if
you type in Aquarius gold this should
pop up you guys like his shirt it's so
stupid
you'll see this pop-up and then they
have them for all the zodiac signs so if
you're a Libra type in Libra or gold on
society6 and this should pop up and then
I just bought it with the frame already
like a huge size so that I could put it
on my wall I just I love it it's so
pretty
which if you didn't know Aquarius azar
Water Bearers of the zodiac so which is
funny because we are an air sign and a
lot of people think that Aquarius is our
water signs but they're not hey you know
that while I was talking about with the
brains you can see it right here in the
reflection I could just point it so I
don't know if you guys follow me on
Twitter I'm sure some of you do but a
couple weeks ago I tweeted that my dad
gave me like a giant box of reels
they're like eight millimeter reels and
it was like this giant dusty box and he
told me that there were a bunch of
videos of him when he was younger like
in his teens and even some of him when
he just came from Cuba when they moved
to Chicago and he was talking about how
he was gonna buy like a projector and we
were gonna sit down and watch it on this
projector and I was like listen let me
just take them I'm gonna take them to
Walgreens and I'm gonna turn them into
DVDs but I need a style and that's what
I did I took them into Walgreens and
there were 30 reels and there were like
$24 each reel so that's probably why my
dad wanted to watch it on a projector
but I was like you know what it's worth
it memories are so important so I took
them into Walgreens and I finally got
them back a couple of days ago and
honestly that was like the best money I
have ever spent I mainly wanted it for
videos of my grandpa I mean also for my
dad I wanted to see my dad when he was
younger as well but mainly my grandpa
I've spoken about him a few times mainly
on like Instagram and stuff and Twitter
but my grandpa died before I was born he
died at a stroke in 89 and I was born in
92 and I have always my entire life felt
really connected to my grandpa which is
strange because he died before I was
born but I don't know is there anybody
out there that feels the same way as I
do
because honestly it's like the weirdest
feeling and I've felt it my whole life
growing up we weren't really allowed to
talk about my grandpa much in front of
my dad not that we weren't allowed it
was just a really touchy subject
he died at 54 years old so he was very
young when he passed and he died of a
stroke and it was out of the blue and
really unexpected and my dad did not
take it well at all he still gets really
really emotional when he talks about him
and when I was younger I want to say I
was like eight or nine I remember I had
this dream and I had it a few times
growing up like this same dream and it's
me walking into
my sister's grandmother's beauty salon
I'm sure a lot of guys know but my
sister and I have different dads and her
dad's mom owns a beauty salon and in my
dream I'm walking into that so long and
I look up and there is a man sitting
underneath like the blow-dryer thing
like the big Oh big you know what I'm
talking about but it's not down you know
like he's not using it he's just sitting
on one of those chairs and he anyway
he's just sitting there and he's wearing
a white t-shirt and some faded jeans I
mean this dream is like burned in my
memory
and in my dream I'm like standing there
staring at him like he looks familiar
and I'm like kind of looking at him and
he's like Ming Ming he's like calling me
over and I'm like scared to come up to
him and he's like Big Mama vain
he's like calling me and when I walk up
to him and I hug him it's my it's my
dad's dad like my my grandfather who I
never ever met and me and my grandpa
like start hugging and hugging and then
I just I wake up and I've had that dream
a couple times growing up and I have
never forgotten about it and everybody
has their own beliefs and their own
opinions but my grandfather was very
into Sun laughs at all he really
believed in Sun loss at all like every
December 17th it was like a it was a big
deal and I get chills even thinking
about it but he actually passed away
December 17th which is insane to even
think about I mean I I don't know do you
guys believe in coincidences because
that is a crazy coincidence to me but he
died in December of 89 so almost 90 I
was born in January of 92 silks like
almost 91 cuz it was January so I was
born shortly after he passed I mean it
wasn't that long ever since I was a
little girl every time I heard it's like
people talk about my dad's dad like it
would get me really emotional I would
hear stories about him and I would start
crying thinking about him and like
missing him so badly when I never even
met the guy and I know I sound crazy but
I feel connected to him in some way and
please don my my tears these home movies
have like opened up this ocean of Tears
that I can't think to stop anyway I was
actually getting to a point before I
went off on a grandfather tangent I was
mainly excited to see video of my
grandpa because I've only seen him in
photos I've never seen him like move
around you know and I mean I was pretty
bummed to see that there was no audio in
any of this footage I remember it
my dad I was like there's no audio he's
like no they're eight millimeter reels
filmed in the seventies like what do you
expect I wanted to hear his voice I
wasn't able to but I mean I'm very
grateful for what I got
Walgreens charges a trillion dollars to
convert your stuff about watching that
footage of my dad as a kid it was so
amazing to see how life was back then
and seeing my grandmother so young and
my dad so young there's a part where
he's like in Chicago and he's like
dancing around acting crazy it's just so
funny to me because that's how I used to
act when I was younger and it's just
nice to look back on those memories like
I'm so grateful that I have that now
seeing my grandparents together like in
these clips and dancing together and
being like so in love and happy with
their three kids it made me feel so warm
it broke my heart to pieces
I watched those clips last night here in
my room with my headphones on on my
laptop and I was just watching the
videos and I was just crying this just
shows you that life really is so short
and all you have are these moments and
these memories and now like all you have
is right now tomorrow isn't promised so
we have to spend as much time with our
loved ones as we can and take lots of
pictures while you can record your
memories and not for YouTube but for
yourself I mean if somebody would have
told my grandpa that day at the park in
Chicago that his granddaughter would be
watching that video like 40 years later
like would he believe it that's just so
insane and my camera is about to die so
I'm gonna wrap this up but I thought
that even though you know I am a very
private person and you guys know I don't
like to go into detail about my personal
life I thought I would share with you
guys a few clips of my family you know
videos from the 70s just so you can see
my dad when he was younger and show you
guys clips of him when he's like 11 in
Chicago and then he's like when he's a
little bit older already in Miami
and you'll see my grandfather and my
grandma my aunt and my uncle and my dad
so yeah I'm gonna wrap this video up
here and I'm gonna insert some footage
and I hope you guys enjoy a little piece
of history I guess yeah I love you guys
so much and I'll see you
my next video by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
