a product that I've been eyeing since it
came out and it is the Real Techniques
was this called miracle complexion
sponge and this is actually pretty new I
think it came out in September so it's
not like terribly new it's been like two
months since this came out and I have
been wanting to get it ever since I
found out about this you guys know how
much I love Real Techniques brushes I
think they are so good for the price and
I would pay a lot more money for them
because they're just so good so when
they came out with a Beauty Blender type
sponge I knew that I wanted to get my
hands on it and I wanted to review it
for you guys so that's what I'm doing
I'm going to be comparing it to the O so
fabulous and famous Beauty Blender is it
a dupe I don't know let's find out okay
so I ordered my sponge online I got it
at I herb calm I think that website has
it for a dollar cheaper than the Real
Techniques website does this sponge
retails for $6.99 I believe and I think
I herb has it for $5.99 and then um if
you order for the first time you get
five dollars off so the sponge ends up
being a dollar and then you pay $4
shipping so basically this turns out to
be $4.99 which is how much I paid for it
which is a crazy deal I mean considering
the Beauty Blender is 20 dollars for
just one sponge I mean I definitely
think it's worth the $20 that's how
great it is but it is it's a pretty
penny you know what I mean
so in this video I'm going to be talking
about all the pros and cons of the
sponge everything I think about it and
I'm going to be comparing it to my
Beauty Blender and I also threw in a
little demo so you can see how it
applies foundation the shape of the
sponge is kind of weird it's I wasn't a
fan of it at first but it has the
typical little pointed little egg shape
at the bottom but the top isn't round
like the Beauty Blender is it is like
flat so I wasn't a fan of it at first
but I love how it applies foundation
because it's just like a flat surface so
it's easy to put your foundation on so I
really like that they did that little
slanted
flat-top thing and I think it's really
good this is by the way what it looks
like after it has been wet I did do the
demo before I sat down and film this so
I had already wet the sponge but it is
probably like half its size when it's
dry which is exactly how the
Beautyblender looks when it's dried this
is also wet you can see um in terms of
size it's it's pretty close match this
is just a tiny bit larger but they oh
but they both double in size when they
get wet you can see in the little clip
that I'm showing you right now I put it
under the water and I just start
squeezing it and squeezing and squeezing
it until I feel like it is as big as
it's going to get so I do that a couple
times and then I rinse it out I squeeze
it as hard as I can and get all the
water out and then I use it I will say
though I feel like this retains water
more than the Beautyblender does I feel
like once you wring out the water in the
Beauty Blender you can squeeze it as
hard as you can and water won't drip
from your hand but with this one I feel
like no matter how many times I squeeze
it there's just so a little bit more
water that will drip down my hand so
really quickly before I get into the
demo I'm gonna talk some pros and cons
I'm going to tell you everything I like
about it first first off is obviously
its price it is incredibly cheap it's
ten times cheaper than the Beauty
Blender and it works really well in my
opinion this is the best dupe out there
for the Beauty Blender it's a lot better
than the Sonia Kashuk one and I think um
I don't know if it's the older brand but
the one that they sell at Ulta um is a
lot better than that one as well this is
as close I feel like it's gonna get to
the Beauty Blender it pretty much gives
my foundation the exact same finish as
the Beauty Blender does they both apply
it so beautifully in like luminous and
it looks so smooth kind of airbrushed
this puts on foundation like a dream as
well to be honest it does the shape is
really cool the fact that you can put on
your foundation with the flat side and
then kind of like roll it with the round
side is awesome it has a pointed little
tip
just like the Beautyblender dust you can
get right underneath your eye which is
what I love about the beauty blender so
I'm happy that this one does that as
well I was really interested to see how
this would hold up when I went to go
wash it because when I was on the Real
Techniques website someone said that
they hated it because after they washed
it for the first time it like completely
deformed and turned into like a
different shape so that kind of worried
me so I washed it two times since I
bought it and nothing has happened to it
maybe she got like a crappy one or
something but it did go back to its nice
little shape after I washed it but yes
there's a but and this is where the cons
come into play when it comes to the
sponge I feel like there would be a lot
more product buildup in this sponge
versus the Beauty Blender while I was
putting on my foundation for the first
time I noticed that I had to do like an
extra little pump of foundation to
completely cover my entire face with the
Beauty Blender that does not happen so
like I said earlier it retains water
more than the Beauty Blender does and I
feel like it retains foundation a little
bit more than the Beauty Blender does
not a significant amount not like oh
crap this is this is drinking of my
foundation uh but it is something I did
notice I'm being extra critical and I
want to tell you like every little
detail that I notice about this sponge
just so you can be well-informed you
know so yeah that is one thing I did not
like about this sponge and okay let's
see if you can tell that's see by
looking at it they look like they would
be made by the same material but they're
not okay you probably can't tell on
camera this probably is pointless but
the Beauty Blender is very bouncy just
you rinse the water out and it's like
it's like there's nothing in the Beauty
Blender like nothing very bouncy and
springy comes right back to life when
you squish it this one it I feel like
it's like a thick barrier in between
it's like can you tell let's try
this one isn't as springy and bouncy as
the Beautyblender is so I don't know how
to explain it I don't know so that's why
I feel like it doesn't ring out the
water as well and it might drink up some
of your foundation and you can
definitely tell a difference once
they're both running under water you see
that the water is just like stuck in
this sponge and you really got to squish
it out when you don't have to do that
with a Beauty Blender that's the only
con honestly that I found about the
sponge that it might drink up your
foundation a little bit so so just keep
that in mind but like I said before I
really love this I'm going to go ahead
and show you the demo of me applying my
foundation with the sponge I'm going to
show you that right now okay so for the
demo I'm going to be using the Urban
Decay Naked Skin Foundation and the
reason why I'm using this foundation in
particular is because I feel like the
Beauty Blender applies it beautifully I
like how the Beauty Blender appliance is
Foundation more than how a brush does so
that's why I love the color by the way
not that I nobody cares but I like that
it's orange and I'm just going to use
the flat side and
maybe I shouldn't have put on lipstick
before I found this
so as you saw it does a wonderful job of
applying my foundation it applies it
nice and even it doesn't make it streaky
at all this does not give you the
streaky look at all if you have a
problem with your foundations looking
really streaky then yeah I definitely
recommend this
so yeah in conclusion I give this
product two thumbs up
but I think it's an exact dupe of the
Beauty Blender no I do think the Beauty
Blender is better but I feel like this
is as close as it's gonna get
it's hard it's hard to beat this guy's
it's hard and you know not everybody's I
don't think anybody is ever gonna ever
going to make an exact dupe but this guy
is like mmm coming close okay so I think
that's everything I have to say about it
if you have any questions leave them
down below by the way I don't know how
to right back to comments anymore I
don't know what happened what Google did
or something but I cannot write back to
you guys there's a bunch of questions
that I was going to answer yesterday
when I was on my laptop and it doesn't
let me reply to comments like do you
guys know if like the fact that YouTube
updated with Google or something like
how do I reply to you guys help me I
don't know but yeah anyway thank you so
