tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now really excited for this video
because it is sponsored by Sephora I'm
using mainly the honest hacia Modern
Renaissance palette but I'm also using
on my eyes the Urban Decay moondust
palette so beautiful and my mascara is
the Marc Jacobs velvet Newar mascara I'm
going to show you how to achieve this
rebel eyes trend it's a fun glittery
look for summer pops of glitter in the
inner corners as well I just love the
warm tones in this look I will have
information all about the rebel eyes
trend in the description box below but
without further ado if you want to see
how to achieve this look then just keep
watching so the first thing I'm going to
do is prime my eyelids with this Urban
Decay enigma primer potion and then I'm
going to go in with the modern
renaissance palette by anastasiya I'm
taking that first shade and I'm just
using this to set that primer down and
then I'm going to take the shade golden
ochre and I'm using this on a fluffy
crease brush and just buffing this into
my crease then I'm going into raw Sienna
and pretty much doing the exact same
thing I'm just trying to build on the
Browns in my crease more warmth I'm
taking the shade burnt orange and I'm
using a smaller crease brush and I am
just applying this into my crease the
same way I used with the other shades
just going back and forth and adding
more warmth and then I just use the
shade tempura to highlight underneath my
brow bone I took the shade Ryoga and I
applied this to my entire lid I wanted a
very oranjee pinkish eye so I just put
that on my entire lid
then I took that same shade with a
smaller crease brush and I just blended
out the edges of the eyeshadow I wanted
something a little bit more pink
so with that same brush I just took
Venetian red and I packed it right on
top of rial gar then I went back in with
the orange and did the exact same thing
then I took a big fluffy blending brush
with no additional eyeshadow and just
blended out those edges I went into the
Urban Decay moondust palette and I took
this pinky orange shade called element
and I just pack this on with my finger I
like how these eye shadows apply more
with your finger since they are very
glittery and this is just going to give
you a hint of sparkle since it has the
same tone as the eyeshadows then I took
a crease brush and just blend it out the
glitters away in my crease I'm going to
quickly move on to my face makeup I'm
using the Too Faced hangover primer to
prime my face and then for foundation
I'm using the Laura Mercier candle glow
foundation I'm in the shade dusk this is
a light coverage but it gives you an
overall glow so I'm just buffing that in
with a foundation brush and now moving
on to the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer I'm using the shade fair and
I'm just applying this where I always do
underneath my eyes to conceal and then
on the rest of my face to highlight as
well and then I'm just buffing that in
to set my under eye concealer I'm using
the NARS translucent crystal powder and
I'm applying this powder on all the
points of my face where I applied
concealer first moving back to the eyes
I'm going to take the shade of burnt
orange on a pencil brush and I am just
buffing this on my lower lash line and
then I'm going to take REO gar and do
the exact same thing but on a more
precise pencil brush and then I'm going
to go into Venetian red and do the exact
same thing I just want the lower lash
line to match what we've got going on
the top then I took the urban decay
waterline I pencil in the shade rail and
I use this on my tight line and on my
waterline as well and then for mascara I
am taking the Marc Jacobs velvet noir
mascara doing a few coats on my top
lashes and on my bottom lashes as well
you can apply winged eyeliner and
falsies if you would like but I actually
prefer how it looks without them to add
some bling to my inner corners I'm
taking the shade of Vermeer on a pencil
brush and just applying this right in
the inner corners and then I'm taking
the moondust palette with the shade
Spectre and I'm applying that right on
top of Vermeer and it gives a beautiful
pinky glittery glow and then to finish
up the rest of my face makeup I'm going
to contour using the NARS Laguna bronzer
contour slash bronze up the skin
I went in with a neutrally blush this is
a Tarte Amazonian clay blush in the
shade sensual and I applied this to my
cheeks and then to highlight the tops of
my cheekbones and my nose I'm using the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector pressed
in the shade champagne pop to finish off
the look I'm taking a lip liner this is
from Make Up For Ever it's in the shade
1c and I'm applying this to my entire
lips I'm lining them and then I'm
filling them in as well and then I'm
taking the Kat Von D liquid lipstick in
the shade Noble right on top it's a
really pretty pale peachy nude color
