tutorial on this look it's using the new
mani and makeup geek palette
I know it's currently sold out but I
will link it below once it comes back in
stock and it was really really requested
to do a look using that palette so I
thought I would give it to you guys now
this look definitely calls for fake
lashes but I could not find my eyelash
flu and beware but it would definitely
look better with some falsies also I do
want to say that my eyelids look a
little bit patchy because I didn't use a
very good base underneath I should have
gone in with like a dark base or like a
deep purple base but I just used regular
like clear eye shadow primer so I'm
going to go ahead and get started but
keep that in mind so I'm setting down
the primer I used and I'm using the Wet
n Wild eye shadow in from Brule now I'm
going into the palette I'm going to take
the shade features and cream on a fluffy
brush and I'm just going to buff that
into my crease and then I just added
some tape to create a sharper edge I'm
going in with the shade Sora which is
kind of like peaches and cream but like
a deeper version really really beautiful
and I'm also buffing that into Z crease
I'm gonna take the shade Mars
it's a beautiful red shade like really
stunning I'm taking it on a skinnier
crease brush something a little bit more
precise and I am just applying this to
the outer corners of my eyes and then
dragging it into my crease now I'm going
to take the all-over lid shade and this
is Aphrodite I highly recommend you go
in with like a base before this step
like a deep plum or like an eyeliner and
put it all over your lid because I
didn't use a very good primer so it came
off a little bit patchy because it
didn't have like a nice base and I'm
just going back into the shade Mars and
I'm
that into the crease again I want the
crease to be very very red so I'm just
adding a little bit more of that color
and now I'm going back into Sora with a
fluffy brush and just blending that out
because I don't want any harsh lines in
my crease okay so going back into
Aphrodite I'm just intensifying the lid
just in case some of it got blended with
all that blending and then I just took
that exact same shade Aphrodite and just
put that directly into my crease so that
it blends really nicely into the red
shade to highlight underneath my brow
bone I used Luna which I probably
shouldn't have because my eyebrows look
a mess I'm trying to grow them out I
told you guys this already but I'm
trying to grow them out to reshape them
so highlighting with a shimmery
highlight probably wasn't a good idea
but whatever I use it anyway so I'm
applying some primer to my face I use
the NYX angel primer and now I'm going
in with the ex1 invisible foundation it
was a little bit dark for me cuz you
know very fair these days but this is in
the shade f-100 and I'm just buffing
that into my face using a wet and wild
flat top kabuki brush and then I'm going
to go in with concealer this is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
vanilla and for a second I thought I
smelled something burning but then I
just kept on filming because I am a very
responsible adult filming comes first
who cares of the houses on fire okay so
I am applying this by the way that was a
joke
I assumed it was the candle burning
behind me so yes anyway I am just a
blending that NARS radiant creamy
concealer into my skin using the Sephora
47 brush I applied that underneath my
eyes and between my eyebrows and just
other places at my face I wanted to
highlight and yeah just buffing that in
doing the thing like I usually do I'm
gonna set all the places I added
concealer and I'm using my RC ma no
color powder and you know set in my face
this foundation doesn't have like a
weird tacky finish so I find that I
don't need to set the rest of my face
just the places I added some
singer so now I'm going to finish up my
eyes I'm using the balm Schwing and I
wanted to show you guys look up my hand
is shaking I had such a hard time
applying eyeliner this day I don't know
why my hand was like shaking so bad look
look look I just I couldn't do it so
yeah I struggled a little bit with my
eyeliner but I tried to make it work I'm
applying my Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara and then I'm going to work on my
lower lash line
I took the shade frappe on a pencil
brush and buff that underneath my lashes
and then I highlighted my inner corners
with blue now this is such a beautiful
inner corner highlight fabulous I'm
taking my Urban Decay eye liner in the
shade main line it's a really cool teal
look cool like teal blue colors amazing
so I just applying it to my waterline
and then kind of blending that a little
bit with a pencil brush and now I'm
going in with insomnia
it's a beautiful blue brown reddish e it
has a bunch of different chips
it's such a pretty color and I just buff
that on my lower lash line and then I
just applied some mascara now I'm going
to contour my face I'm using the wet and
wild contour brush and I'm mixing two
shades I'm using warm porcelain and cool
porcelain these are the makeup geek
contour powders I really really like
them and I love mixing these two
specific shades to get like a perfect
contour for blush I'm using the Milani
baked blush in berry amore I love this
blush because I feel like it goes with
so many looks and since the eyes are a
little intense I didn't want to go you
know to in Sam's but I am going in tants
with my highlight this is the wet and
wild highlight in the shade Hollywood
Boulevard such a stunning like golden
shade so beautiful so I'm just
highlighting the top of my cheekbones
and on my nose and stuff and then I'm
going in with my lip this is a new over
liquid lipstick in the shade Dubai it's
a really really nude color so I'm going
over it with a Make Up For Ever lip
gloss in the shade 104 and then that
completes this makeup look I really hope
