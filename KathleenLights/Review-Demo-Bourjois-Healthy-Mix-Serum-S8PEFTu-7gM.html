and demo on a foundation that I have
been absolutely loving and that is the
Bourjois healthy mix serum I use this
foundation in a recent video and a bunch
of you guys said you wanted to see a
review on it so let's get started by the
way this is not to be confused with the
original healthy mix foundation this is
the healthy mix serum there are two
completely different foundations this
one is gel based I don't know much about
the original since I don't own it but I
know that this is a gel foundation a few
people have asked me what the difference
is between this one and now one and I
can't personally tell you since I've
never used that one before but from what
I've heard this one caters a little bit
more to dry skin and it's just a little
bit more luminous and like lightweight
from what I hear so as a lot of you
probably know bourgeois is not sold in
the States it is a UK brand so I have to
get mine online I can't remember if I
got enough Amazon or Ebay but I have
seen it a bunch of times on eBay and I
got mine in the shade 52 vanilla
honestly when it came to the color
selection I had to wing it since I had
never seen one of these things in person
so I just googled swatches of the color
and then I picked one that I thought
would be closest to my skin tone and
thankfully this is like spot-on to my
skin color it is like it matches
perfectly so if you guys do live in the
States I would check eBay because that
seems to have the most selection I know
ASOS comm sells a bunch of bourgeois
and they shipped to the States but I
have never seen the healthy mix serum on
that website I have seen the original
healthy mix but not the healthy mix
serum just google it try finding it it
may take a while it took me a while to
find this really quickly I'm going to
read to you a couple of things on the
bottle so you can get an idea of what
this claims to do it says 16 hours
radiance boosting even revived
complexion it is hypoallergenic which
means that you shouldn't break out to it
if you have sensitive skin I have
sensitive skin and I've never broken out
using this foundation it says instant
blending gel flawless complexion
undetectable coverage and it has vitamin
rich fruits inside this foundation like
goji berries pomegranate are the
different fruits as well so this
foundation is supposed to make you look
and feel healthy it's vitamin enriched I
am
obsessed with this foundation I think
it's the best foundation I have ever
used because it caters to my skin type
foundation is one of those things that
not everybody is going to like the same
thing but I feel like this is so amazing
for me it does have a strong fruit scent
it's not like a fragrant scent you could
tell that there's fruits in it because
it smells like straight-up fruits like
intense like it has a very very strong
scent but it's not like a fragrance kind
of scent if that makes any sense this
has a light to medium coverage you can
definitely build it up to be like medium
intense medium coverage because I feel
like no matter how many layers you apply
to your skin it just sinks into your
skin and it looks like skin it doesn't
look cakey whatsoever this is like the
definition of like not cakey it is so
smooth and it just blends flawlessly it
does have a dewy finish it has like a
luminous finish I didn't use a highlight
on my face today so that you can see the
dew eNOS
it gives I will be inserting a demo here
soon with close-up shots so you can see
the foundation a lot better you know
closer to my skin now I didn't set it
with the powder I set my under eye
concealer and my t-zone right here with
the powder but I did not set the rest of
my makeup so if you do have more combo
skin and you have this foundation I
would definitely set it with a powder if
you don't like the luminous glow but
what impressed me so much with this
foundation is that it's not tacky to the
touch I feel like I am not wearing any
foundation on my face right now and
that's saying a lot for something that's
like nice and dewy you would think that
it stays feeling tacky or wet and it
doesn't even even though I didn't set it
I mean of course putting bronzer on top
kind of helps but I I love the feeling
the sleeves on my face it feels like I
am wearing absolutely nothing this is a
long wearing foundation I haven't worn
it for 16 hours straight like the bottle
claims cuz I don't wear my makeup for 16
hours but it does last a really long
time and it looks beautiful throughout
the day I don't feel like I get oily
throughout the day or look more luminous
you also have to take in consideration
that I have dry skin but anyway it wears
amazingly
feels amazingly and I personally think
it looks really good it looks like I
have a healthy glow to my skin which is
what I want so really quickly I'm going
to insert the demo or the clip of me
applying this foundation on my face
so he's on the demo I use my real
techniques buffing brush and it just
blends into the skin so smoothly I think
that if you want even like do your
appearance you could use your beauty
blender and it would probably look
absolutely beautiful with that I
definitely recommend this foundation for
those of you with normal skin or dry
skin or those of you who don't want to
cover up too much on your face because
like I said the coverage isn't going to
be like Revlon Colorstay or anything
like that it is a light but buildable
coverage most foundations cake me up
around my nose and in between my
forehead and I'm going to show you
close-up clips of my nose and my
forehead and as you can see it is not
cakey it doesn't flake around my nose
like so many foundations do it doesn't
look thick and it doesn't look like I
have a mask on it looks so natural and
dewy and healthy like I've said a
million times I'm probably getting
repetitive and annoying but I just I
can't I can't stress enough how well
this looks on my skin I paid around $13
for this foundation online I don't know
how much it is in the UK or how much
it's going to be for you because I guess
it depends on where you buy like eBay
Amazon ASOS if they have it on ASOS you
know I guess it depends where you find
it but for what I remember I paid around
$13 for mine and that's incredibly cheap
that's a drugstore price and it's worth
every penny I would pay double for this
foundation maybe even triple when it
comes to cons of this foundation there
are absolutely no cons I can think of
the only bad thing is that I cannot find
it in the state which makes me so
incredibly sad because I do not know if
I'll be able to find it again which is
why I'm like using
very very sparingly and it been just so
sad why can't they so bourgeois here why
so yeah I give this foundation 5 out of
5 stars because it just works so well
with my skin so yeah that is my review
on this foundation let me know down
below if you have this on nation and if
you like it as well and let me know if
you have the original healthy mix
foundation and how it compares to this
one I would love to know and also if you
find it online somewhere else let me
know because I'm just scared I'm not
going to find this again thank you so
much for watching guys please subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
