a foundation review on the new well
fairly new I would say covergirl outlast
stay luminous natural glow foundation I
have mine in 842 medium beige have no
makeup on my skin currently I just have
my eyebrows filled in because they take
forever and I'm going to be applying
this foundation now with the Real
Techniques sculpting brush usually I use
Beauty blenders most of the time not so
much on camera I've noticed but off
camera I always use a Beauty Blender but
for foundations that tend to be glowy or
tend to be more luminous I like using a
brush to get as much coverage as I can
because usually when a foundation is due
it has like a little bit less coverage
than like a matte foundation and beauty
blenders tend to make foundations on
even more dewy so I want to see like
it's true doing this on my skin without
a V blender I'm going to apply some
primer before I put on this foundation I
have used this foundation once or twice
before this point I just want you to see
how it applies how it looks on my skin
and all that stuff so I'm going to prime
my face first
I always prime my face no matter what
foundation I use so just like the smart
thing I guess would be to prime
regardless so I'm using the Make Up For
Ever step one skin equalizer in
smoothing the smoothing one okay why was
that so hard to get out I'm just gonna
rub that on my fingers and press that
here you I love that this foundation has
a pump it's probably my favorite thing
about it so just going to pump it on the
back of my hand I'm going to do one pump
for now if I have to add more I will and
just dab it in
and start applying it I like to apply
this foundation by pressing it into my
skin I don't really like to rub so much
I feel like I get more coverage by
pressing
um it's currently that time of the month
so I got three little friends right here
snap crackle and pop who are on my face
so we shall see how it covers it
and I'm adding the second home
I usually do two pumps with a lot of
foundations
maybe you need a pump and a half I don't
really think you need two full pumps
well I mean depending on what you want
to cover so
I have applied two layers of this
foundation like I get sometimes I get
like rashes here if something breaks me
out and I'll get like a red rash and I
find that it doesn't get cakey so it is
buildable I didn't build a little
coverage but the coverage I don't know
if you can tell is where the goop it's
pretty good
and then after I press everything in I
go in off it move it out
okay so this is the foundation on my
face and you can tell is luminous it's
very very dewy it's it's a very dewy
foundation and it even feels duly on my
face I'm going to give it a couple of
seconds to maybe or a couple of minutes
and maybe set in place okay so I brought
you in closer so you can kind of see
it's been on my face for like about a
minute a minute now and it is very very
glowy very dewy it did not let me zoom
you a little more it did not cling on to
dry areas around my nose or right here
these two areas is where I get the
driest my t-zone is actually the driest
part of my face and usually if a
foundation is too cakey or heavy it like
flakes really ugly right here and right
here so it does not cling on to any dry
patches because obviously it's a very
dewy foundation so this is what it looks
like up close as you can see it's not
like 100% full coverage because you can
still see my red birthmark in between my
eyebrows that I have and a little bit of
redness peeking through on my pimple
there but it gives but a geat but it
gives a nice just like medium coverage
it evens out the skin tone it makes it
look healthy I'm going to go ahead and
finish the rest of my face and then I
will give you like my full review on the
product okay so I put on like very
minimal makeup too slow but I shall
don't actually just use a little bit of
bronzer
I didn't highlight my face just because
I want you to see the fat I didn't even
put on some lip I just want you to see
the foundation while it's sitting on my
skin while I talk about it so like I
said earlier actually really love this
um there are a couple things about it
that I don't like which I'll talk about
but for the most part I think it's great
for dry skin I have dry skin and it's
really good I have very dry skin and I
like it I will say that even when it
sets you still feel it on your face like
it's tacky you touch it and it feels
dewy so I would highly recommend setting
this foundation with a powder even if
you do have dry skin
use like very little powder just to set
down that tackiness and so I could feel
like powder on your face and I mean you
don't feel it tacky at all why making
those faces I know you don't feel
attackee at all but if you were to touch
your face you would feel it I know it's
not a big deal for some people because
some people don't touch their face but
it's a big deal for others so I just
wanted to point that out I kind of saw
that coming because it's a luminous
foundation it wasn't like a liquid to
powder another thing I do not like is
that it does settle into my pores I have
to use a smoothing primer or a pore
filling primer with this product because
it will settle just slightly into my
pores nothing too crazy honest just I
noticed that and I want to tell you guys
that if you have very very very large
pores I'm not exactly sure if you would
like this well maybe using something
like benefit Porefessional will help you
another thing I noticed is that it
doesn't last
like the full day at least not on me I
won't I have a question to ask you guys
really quickly would you guys prefer
next time I do a foundation review like
next time there's a new foundation on
the market and I pick it up to review it
for you guys would you want me to do a
first impressions to where where I wear
it throughout the day and I show you
what it looks like at the end of the day
or do you prefer reviews I personally
don't like to film first impressions
because my opinion changes like
instantly and that's why I like to try
foundation like two times before I do a
review like I've worn this two times
before this time just so I can like
gather my true thoughts and then tell
you guys about it because sometimes I
change my mind on first impressions but
anyway just let me know in the comments
anyway so this doesn't last as long as
Revlon Colorstay on me as long as my
makeup forever face and body doesn't
last that long but I get about six hours
of this where it still looks really good
so you know I guess it depends I have
really dry skin and foundations don't
break up on my skin unless they're matte
foundations so it just depends on your
skin if you have really oily skin I
don't think you would like this I don't
have a shimmery bronzer on I have a very
matte bronzer actually this is a face
powder but a dark one the powdered
underneath my eyes with like a matte
powder and everything and you can still
see that my face look
nice and dewy and luminous I didn't
powder my face like I should have just
because I wanted you guys to see how it
looked without powdering if you have
normal to combo skin I still think you
would really like this
just remember to powder your face and I
still think that that luminosity will
shine through a little bit but like I
said it's a very dewy foundation and I
don't know if you would love it if you
had oily skin I love the packaging I
love the pump I mean it's not like so
beautiful but I like that it has a pump
and that's the best thing a drugstore
foundation can do for me I got mine at
CVS so it's a little bit more expensive
at CVS as opposed to Target or Walmart
so I would get it in those places also I
did have the original covergirl outlast
stay fabulous foundation it's the one
that looks just like this but with the
blue pump that everybody raves about
it's like everyone's favorite I had it
and I liked it for a little bit but then
when the winter came I had to give it
away because my skin was just too dry
for it so maybe if you have combination
skin and you have that foundation it
would be nice to mix it with this one it
seems like the formulas would be good
for mixing I don't know since I don't
have that one anymore but if you have
oily oily skin I recommend the one with
the blue pump so yeah I give this a
thumbs up for my skin type and I don't
find that it oxidizes on me I find that
it stays the exact same color oh another
thing I did notice that I didn't like as
it kind of gets in my little laughs
lines like if I'm laughing it'll kind of
set in the little line so just make sure
that you apply your primer like you're
smoothing primer on those lines as well
so yeah that completes this video I hope
you guys enjoyed my thoughts or enjoyed
this video on my thoughts on this
foundation I never do foundation reviews
have you guys noticed I feel like I'm a
fool and I can't really from like review
foundations I don't know why I like suck
at it I hope you enjoyed this video
