a review and demo application type of
video with this this is the it cosmetics
bye bye foundation I initially was going
to do a first impressions but my mind
changes so much when I use a product for
the first time I really have to play
around with a product before I can give
you an honest review because sometimes I
like to use it with different primer
different tools to apply it I have to
play around with something before I give
you like a full review so that's what
I'm doing today I've been using this for
about two weeks non-stop so I already
know how I feel about this and in this
video specifically I really really
really wanted to compare it to the a
cosmetics your skin but better CC cream
I posted a picture of this on my
Instagram a ton of you guys asked me
well what's the difference between that
and the CC cream I'm also going to be
comparing it to this product for those
of you who wanted to know that so let me
give you my little backstory okay so I
was just sitting on my couch one day and
I was flipping through the channels and
I came across like this whole special on
this product the a cosmetics owner was
talking about why she created it and she
uses it the whole thing and it just
intrigued me so much that I had to
purchase it immediately it looked that
amazing I haven't heard anybody talking
about this yet I really haven't seen
much buzz on the internet about this I'm
not sure if it's new or old I just saw
the special and I purchased it okay so
I'm gonna start off by telling you what
this claims to do this is not a
foundation it's called buy buy
foundation because you don't need
foundation after using this you know
that's what they say this is a
full-coverage moisturizer it has SPF 50
just like the CC cream and it's
basically described as like your
all-in-one product it's your moisturizer
it's your foundation it's your concealer
it's everything in one product is your
sunscreen and I really feel like it is
that to be honest with you just right
off the bat I really love this product
it does everything it claims its gonna
do but I am a little bit torn on this
product because it's just so incredibly
similar to my CC cream that I don't
really understand I'm going to get into
the demo at the end of the video I'm
going to show you how it applies on my
skin and everything but really quickly I
I'm gonna compare it to this product
just in case you were wondering that is
honestly the main question I got like
wait a minute that looks just like this
ez Kreme what's the difference okay so
when you turn the bottles around first
of all they have the exact same
packaging which is okay I mean that has
nothing to do with it I love the
packaging of these products I love that
they have a pump this buy bow front this
by by foundation has a pump but when you
read the back of the bottles they say
the exact same thing like I'm not even
joking they say the exact same thing
they both have the same amount of SPF
and they're both titanium dioxide and
zinc oxide they have like the physical
sunscreen both of them the only
difference is that the front of the
by-by foundation just says full coverage
moisturiser and then the front of the CC
cream says full coverage cream instead
of a full coverage moisturiser all of
this information is written on the back
of the bye-bye foundation it's the same
so I'm really confused as to what the
difference is if I'm gonna be honest to
me I only tell like a slight difference
when it comes to two things the first
one being that the by-by foundation
smells a little bit better
it smells like oranges it has a nice
delicious citrusy scent so I think it
smells better than the CC cream and the
other thing I noticed is that this one
is a little bit more hydrating a little
bit more dewy I would say a little bit
more hydrating but it just looks a dewy
or on my skin when I initially apply it
I'm like whoa this is it really does
look like a moisturiser when you put it
on so it's just a little bit dewier this
one is still very hydrating and dewy as
well this one just a little bit mo just
a little bit mo initially I wanted to do
this video by applying this one to half
of my face and then this one to the
other half of my face but I don't have
the same shades this is in the shade
light and this is in the shade fair this
one is much lighter and I don't have the
CC cream in the shade light but if not I
would have definitely done that video I
think that would be a cool video
basically if you're a fan of the CC
cream you might be a fan of the buy buy
foundation I find them just so similar I
don't think you need both of them if I'm
going to be completely honest I will say
though if you like kind of like a
citrusy scent go with eBay by foundation
and if you have like really really
really really really dry skin go with
the buy buy foundation
as I find it just a little bit more
moisturizing also I find that the
coverage is pretty close ly the CC cream
has just a tad more coverage but
honestly I don't think so they both say
full coverage I think the coverage is
very very similar let me go into more
detail on the by-by foundation for those
of you who click this video specifically
for this product I really really love it
but that's no surprise of course I find
that it applies really well with a bunch
of different things I love it with my
Beauty Blender I love it with this brush
today I applied it with the elf brush
the ultimate blending brush and it
applied so nicely this is a three dollar
brush it just buffs into the skin so
beautifully this blends really well I
don't know if it's because it's like a
moisturizer it just blends right and you
can use your fingers a Beauty Blender a
brush anything I just find that it
doesn't get streaky or cakey or weird
like I said earlier this has a very dewy
finish light and fresh this would be the
perfect product for the spring and
summer because it has a high SPF so
you're really protected from the Sun but
it has coverage as well you're not
throwing on a tinted moisturizer that
barely covers anything you have really
great coverage in it as well
extremely buildable I could apply two
layers of this and it won't get cakey I
do have to set this though it is a
little bit too dewy and too hydrating
for me so I usually go over it with my
pores powder my RCM a powder and set it
down and then apply like bronzers and
blush and all that stuff on top of it
okay so now I'm gonna go into like the
demo of this video I started off with a
very fresh clean face I had just washed
my face I have some redness here on my
cheeks because my face was itching
earlier this morning and I started to
scratch the side of my face and I got
really red there but I didn't apply any
real primer I just threw on some
Smashbox primer water as kind of like a
base and then I went in with this
product I started off with a pump on my
elf brush and then I started to blend
this into my face and I don't know if
you can tell but it did a pretty good
job of covering the redness I had
towards my jawline it has really great
coverage lens so easily and it just
looks so dewy as you can probably see
and probably tell it just looks very
very very hydrating I was also very very
impressed with the fact that it did not
take up around my nose and in between my
eyebrows because usually when things are
really great coverage they cake up in
those areas and you can see like right
there in between my eyebrows I usually
get a lot of cakiness like it looks
really bad with full coverage products
but this looks nice and natural the only
thing I will say though is that you're
gonna probably want to use a primer that
covers your pores kind of like a benefit
Porefessional or the Make Up For Ever
smoothing primer because this kind of
sinks into your pores just a little bit
so I definitely recommend using a pore
filler before hand I'm wearing it right
now obviously underneath all this makeup
and I just think it looks so beautiful I
will say though that it doesn't last a
million hours I have foundations that
last a really long time on the skin and
this one doesn't really do that and it's
not supposed to it's not like a long
wear foundation but I get about a good
five hours with that so yeah that
completes this review I hope you guys
enjoyed I hope that for those of you who
already have this product and we're
thinking about buying this maybe now
you'll pass on it maybe you'll still buy
it if you're like me and you like in the
makeup and you like all of them makeup
so yeah thank you guys so much for

already and I will see you in my next
video

similar I thought that I think that I
think that look please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in

then this one I'm loving using this
underneath lipsticks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
