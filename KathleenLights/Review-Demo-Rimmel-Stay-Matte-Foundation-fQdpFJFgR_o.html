review on the brand-new Rimmel stay
matte foundation stay matte foundation
that came out really recently really
quickly though I wanted to explain
what's going on behind me this is my new
setup that I'm gonna be working with for
like the next six months I'm not exactly
done I still have to do something to the
walls the walls are really plain but
this is pretty much when I'm working
with I know my old set up is a little
bit cuter but this is a super last
minute of what I could do in my old room
so I hope you guys like it I hope you
like it
I'm still working on the lighting
situation and what I'm going to be doing
with that so the lighting might be a
little bit off in this video but I'm
working on it so yeah now that I'm
pretty much done with all this stuff I
can start doing my regular uploads like
three times a week and get back into
filming so sorry for that little hiatus
sorry so anyway the review is going to
be on the Rimmel stay matte foundation
I've been using this for about a week
and a half for a while I've used about
seven times so I pretty much know how I
feel about this I am doing a demo in
this video so I'm gonna show you like in
a clip how it applies and the finish and
what it looks like in the coverage and
all that stuff so I do - a demo in this
video just to let you guys know but
really quickly I'm going to tell you all
the things I like about it and the pros
and cons or whatever so really quickly
I'm going to tell you all the things
that this foundation claims to do it's
supposed to be a feather-light liquid
mousse that blends flawlessly for
natural-looking skin all day shine
control silky smooth formula leaves a
perfectly matte baby soft finish
lightweight texture and won't feel heavy
or greasy I honestly was not gonna buy
this because you guys know that my skin
is like super incredibly dry a lot of
foundations of cakey on my skin
especially once that same at any
foundation that says matte in the title
I stay far far away from them but I
really wanted to try this because I've
been loving like moosie kind of
foundations lately I don't know so I
decided to give it a try just in case I
might like it and I surprisingly really
love this foundation the first time I
use this foundation I really wasn't a
fan of it it made me look extra dry and
I just didn't like it but I found a way
that it really works for me I use it
with the baby skin instant pore eraser
and it works really well I just feel
like if you have dry skin as long as you
use a really good primer then you'd be
good with this so let's talk about the
pros and cons okay pros the color match
is actually pretty good I kind of just
wind it it's called I have the shade
true ivory they only have eight shades
which kind of sucks but they're not very
cool toned or anything
they're pretty warm so if you like
warmer tone foundations like I do they
will it will suit you another good thing
is that even though it is matte it
doesn't feel cakey or drying like it
doesn't look matte on my skin when I put
it on it's like a satin finish I want to
say it's not super matte so it has a
really nice finish to skin it's super
comfortable to wear you know some matte
foundations make you feel like go make a
mask on this does not do that it's
really really lightweight it isn't
greasy at all by the way I think that
this would be perfect for a normal to
oily skin like combination skin if you
have dry skin like me I would suggest
you use a moisturizer before you use
this and then use like either a
moisturizing primer or like a really
good primer that evens out your skin and
it kind of covers your dry patches
before you use this but I really think
that way skin would really like this
normal skin I really think that you can
make it work no matter what skin type
you have because it is really
lightweight but it does have really good
coverage this I would say has a medium
to full coverage this is the foundation
I'm wearing on right now by the way and
it covers all of my redness I have like
a bunch of redness right here and it
covers my redness perfectly another
great thing by the way is the price
point this cost me $4.99 which does
pretty good it also didn't break me out
I've worn it for about a week and a half
now and I have not gotten any breakouts
and I've had it on all day for several
days and I have pretty sensitive skin so
that's a good thing
okay and now I'm just going to tell you
guys what I don't like about this
foundation there really is only one
thing I don't like about it and it is
the wear it gives me this foundation
looks flawless right off the bat but I
only get about five hours of wear with
this foundation before it starts to
break up and it breaks up a pretty damn
splotchy like it looks flawless for a
while like about five
and then after it starts like crack and
look really weird my friend Gabby was
like oh yeah I noticed you had like some
spots on your face after wearing it for
like about five to eight hours it does
wear off in an unattractive way
foundations never last on me regardless
like no foundation lasts more than like
six hours for me except Revlon Colorstay
that could probably last through the
apocalypse for me like it lasts forever
but that's the only foundation that
lasts really long for me most
foundations they were off pretty fast
not gonna lie
so yeah that's pretty much the only
thing I don't like about it is the way
it fades not so much to wear but the way
that it fades it's it's not cute guys
it's not cute so I'm just quickly going
to show you the demo how it applies on
what it looks like on my skin and the
coverage it gives me I'm going to go
ahead and insert that clip right now for
you guys
so as you guys saw on the demo it
applies pretty evenly I really think
that you should try this out it it
doesn't hurt it's $4.99 so it's really
inexpensive so I really think it would
work for you especially if you have like
combo skin I think this would be your
friends all and I rate this foundation
probably like I would give it a beat I'm
gonna give it an a because it kind of
wears off pretty weird but I do really
really like this I definitely give it a
B it's a B it's good stuff so yeah it's
pretty much everything I have to say
about this foundation I hope you guys
try it out let me know down below if you
have used this and if it worked for you
and yeah that is all I have to say thank
you so much for watching it please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
