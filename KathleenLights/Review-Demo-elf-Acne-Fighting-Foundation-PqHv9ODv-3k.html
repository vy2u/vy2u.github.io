a review and demo on the elf acne
fighting foundation I hauled this not
too long ago and a bunch of you guys
wanted to see a full review and demo on
it so here I am so we have eight
different shades I got mine in the color
buff I did buy mine online so I honestly
winged it I was like um okay it look
like I'm buff I don't know I haven't
seen this foundation at any targets or
any place that they sell elf I have only
seen it online since it is fairly fairly
new at least on the website it says new
right next to it so it's new so this
foundation claims to be a lightweight
acne fighting foundation works a
disguise redness blemishes and uneven
skin tone it has a flawless coverage
that is infused with acne fighting
ingredients like salicylic acid witch
hazel tea tree and soothing aloe to help
prevent and treat acne blemishes I
haven't been wearing this foundation
every single day or long enough for me
to tell you if it's acne fighting or
anything like that
but I can tell you that it has not
broken me out and I do have sensitive
skin and I really don't care if a
foundation makes my skin better as long
as it doesn't make it worse you know
what I mean so if it's doing absolutely
nothing I'm okay with that too and so
far I've had no problems with that I
will be showing you the demo of me
applying this just so you can see the
coverage that this has but I'm also
going to be showing you like up close
like really close to my skin so you can
see how it kind of lays on my skin if
that makes sense because any foundation
pretty much looks good from far away but
up close is when you see you see the
real stuff okay before I go on to the
pros and cons like I always do I'm going
to go ahead and show you the demo of me
applying this
okay so after watching the demo you kind
of have an idea of the coverage that
this has this has full-on coverage which
of course is a pro if you have any like
acne blemishes or acne scars and stuff
like that a lot of redness discoloration
this is a really good foundation for
that because it covers so well
continuing on with the pros of this
foundation I really really love the
packaging of this foundation I like that
it looks so sleek and it's really cute
and I love that it has a squeeze tube
which makes application so much easier
another thing I really really loved
about this foundation is that my face
did not stay wet after I applied it I
mean as soon as I put it on I did have
like tackiness to the touch you know
just like most foundations but it does
eventually set in and dry I did not
powder my face after I put this on and I
will explain later why I didn't but I
never you know I never powder my face
after I use this and it doesn't bother
me it doesn't have that tacky gross
feeling I mean I guess you feel just a
little bit of tackiness but nothing that
bothers me and I'm one of those people
that really really hate having my face
feel like I'm wearing foundation and I
have to say that I don't really feel
like I'm wearing foundation not really
at least I like that another great thing
is that this foundation lasts a pretty
long time on my skin I do have dry skin
so most foundations typically tend to
last longer on my skin anyway but this
one does last a good eight hours on my
face I would consider this foundation
not 100% matte but it's not doing by any
means I did I do look dewy right now
because I added a lot of highlight to my
face cuz mama goes a little crazy
sometimes I'm not gonna lie I put
highlight on my face like I put a lot
but alone without any highlighted
products this does give you like a satin
finish which satin finishes are actually
my favorite kind of finishes when it
comes to foundation satin and dewy
finishes are my favorite I'm not running
into that flat matte look if you do want
that super matte look then just set it
with a powder like I said I didn't but
I'm sure that if I set it with a powder
it would be like full-on matte the Sun
fog
to me a little bit I'm not gonna lie
like while I'm applying it on my face it
does have like a paint like a strong
paint set but as soon as I'm done
applying my makeup I do not smell it
anymore it is not one of those scents
that lingers on your face so that
doesn't bother me
oh and another great thing which is
probably the greatest thing about this
is that it is six dollars on the elf
website which is insanely inexpensive
now I'm going to talk about the things I
do not like about this product one being
the color selection there are only eight
colors which is ridiculous because there
are not only eight skin tones in the
world guys you know so I'm sure a lot of
people are going to struggle to find
their right shade in this just because
there's only eight to choose from and
some people have yellow undertones some
people have pink undertones and I just
think that there should be a lot more
colors another thing I don't like is
that this kind of looks a little cakey
on my skin I'm not going to lie a little
cakey I just take into consideration
that has a witch hazel in it and
ingredients that would typically be for
a person with oily skin so obviously
it's not going to give me the same
results as it will for someone with oily
skin so it does look a little bit cakey
around my nose and in between my
forehead this is definitely a foundation
or I know I'm wearing foundation you
know like when you look in the mirror
and you're like yeah I could tell I have
foundation on this is definitely it so
with that being said I don't recommend
this for people with really dry skin I
recommend this for people with normal to
oily skin it kind of looks a little bit
patchy and crusty right around my nose
and then between my foreheads and it
kind of just sits on my skin really
weird because there's so much dryness
going on on my face so I mean that
bothers me when it comes to this
foundation because nobody wants to look
like they have a cakey nose or anything
like that so I mean definitely check it
out if you have a lot of dry patches on
your face I proud I would skip it but if
you don't look into it it's really
inexpensive and I think it's worth $6
even if it doesn't work out for you and
it's cute which is not a good reason to
my foundation so yeah that is everything
I have to say about this foundation let
me know down below if you have tried it
and what you think about it please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next one bye
