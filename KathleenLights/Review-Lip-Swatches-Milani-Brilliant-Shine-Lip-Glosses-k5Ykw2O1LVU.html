the Milani brilliant shine lip glosses I
have six with me here right now and I
posted a video a couple days ago on a
review on the Milani lip intense liquid
colors and I asked you guys if you
wanted to see my thoughts on the
brilliant shine lip glosses and a couple
of you guys said yes so here I am and
again of course I will be showing you
lip swatches of all of these on my lips
so before I show you the lip swatches I
want to talk a little bit about them
there are 14 of these in total on the
Milani website but I only have six of
them you can find these at CVS Walgreens
Target anywhere where they sell Milani
these lip glosses claimed to be super
super shiny yet not feel sticky or tacky
like most glosses that are super thick
and glossy tend to feel the packaging is
really pretty I love Milani packaging I
love the gold details I love that it has
a doe foot applicator because it's a lot
easier to apply and they retail for 549
which is incredibly cheap they have a
bunch of beautiful different colors on
their website and I like that they
arranged and finishes I have four cream
finishes that means that there's
absolutely no sparkle in them which is
my favorite I love that and then I have
two sparkly glittery ones as well so I'm
going to go ahead and show you the lip
swatches on my lips and then I will talk
a little bit more about that after keep
in mind though I do have to say that I
have really pigmented lips I have like
read my lips are really really red
naturally so no matter what lip gloss I
put on unless it's like completely 100%
pigmented you will see my natural lip
color shine through so these might look
different on me than they do on you not
only because everybody has different
skin tones so lip glosses look different
everybody but because my lips are so
pigmented so yeah just keep that in mind
I'm gonna go ahead and show you the lip
swatches now
okay so as you can see these lip glosses
are pretty pigmented especially
considering the fact that my lips are so
pigmented on their own I do love the
pigmentation these look beautiful
beautiful over lipsticks like this is
the one I'm wearing right now and even
though it's really nice and pigmented
you can see how pigmented it is it looks
amazing on top of a red lipstick same
goes for this coral one and this pink
one these three are my favorite ones
pink lady coral crush and read my lips
these three are my absolute favorite one
personally I am NOT a fan of the two
glittery ones umm luminous and new touch
these are just not my cup of tea I don't
like super glittery lip glosses not my
thing but if you're into glittery lip
glosses then yeah I'm sure you would
love these I'm probably gonna give these
to my mother or something but aside from
that I am really really impressed with
these lip glosses like really impressed
especially the fact that they're so
cheap and there's just such good quality
they're not sticky whatsoever in my
opinion but they are super super glossy
so they were right about that a hundred
percent they do have a little bit of
tackiness them because it is a gloss but
not even like I it doesn't bother me at
all
oh also another downside of these lip
glosses is that you do have to reapply
throughout the day they're not super
super long-lasting you do have to
reapply which doesn't really bother me
all that much I just throw it in my
purse reapply no big deal um I really
love the scent of these to me they smell
there's some oh my god it smells like
something specific oh um have you guys
ever tried the Oreo brownies they come
in like little packets and they're blue
and it's like Oreo brownie yeah this
smells exactly like exactly like Oreo
brownies is it weird that I did I feel
that way so the scent gets an A+ from me
because I love like yummy delicious
baked good type of sense so I look these
don't smell bad I'm really big on the
whole weird
plasticky scent type of thing so I love
that so yeah the only bad thing is that
they
lasts all day and I'm not really too
fond of the glittery shimmery glosses in
their collection but I really really
love these lip glosses I think they're
worth the money they're really
affordable you can get them at the
drugstore I don't think it hurts to try
these out
I recommend pink lady the most I think
and this red one is beautiful too I
recommend these three like I said
earlier so definitely try out any of
these lip glosses let me know if you own
any and what you think about them thank
you so much for watching guys please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
