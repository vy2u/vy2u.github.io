a quick review on the fairly new Milani
lip intense liquid colors this is what
they look like they are bold lip glosses
basically they come in four amazing
shades and I'm gonna be showing you lip
swatches in this video cuz I know you
guys like that so before I go on to the
lip swatches I just quickly want to tell
you a little bit more about the product
they claimed to be super shiny intense
lip glosses but have the staying power
of a lipstick which is nice when it
comes to the packaging there might me so
much of the Marc Jacobs lip glosses they
have like the similar packaging I feel I
don't know have you guys seen those they
look similar when you take the top off
it has a little wand with a sponge tip
applicator which is my favorite um way
to apply lip gloss I do not like lip
glosses that have like a V brush I feel
like every time you go to put your brush
back into the tube like the brush gets
messed up or is that just me Amaya
Savage
I don't know these retail for 649 on the
Milani website and you could also get
these like at CVS Target Walgreens any
drug store that sells Milani so these
are fairly inexpensive which is great
for people on a budget so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you the lip swatches and
then I'm gonna tell you things I like
about this and the things I don't like
about this
okay so as you guys saw in those clips
they are extremely intense lip colors
just like they claim to me they're not
for the faint of heart they're loud and
they're bold which is my personal
favorite I love intense bold lip colors
especially in the spring and summer when
it comes to which ones I love the most I
do love the pink one in the fiery coral
this one is my absolute favorite it is
so loud and oh my god I love it and I do
really also love the red extreme one
which is the one I'm wearing right now
these two are my favorite ones out of
the four just in case you were wondering
okay so let's top pros I love the colors
I love how intense and bold they are
they're not just basic bland new lip
glosses
I love the formula I love that they are
very very creamy and they just glide on
your lips and they don't skip you know
how some lip glosses you'll put on and
it's extreme or they skip that doesn't
happen with these lip glosses whatsoever
I love the doe foot applicator I love
that not too much product comes off on
your wand so when you're putting on your
like Oh everywhere I really love the
packaging I know the packaging is not a
big deal to a lot of people but I just I
think they're cool they look nice in my
drawer I like it that's one of the main
things I really love about melania is
their packaging I love anything that has
gold detailing and a lot of their
products do so I like that I also really
really love the staying power of these
bad boys it claims to be long lasting
like a lipstick and I agree because
honestly it feels like I'm wearing a
lipstick it's not sticky or goopy
whatsoever it's literally like a creamy
moosie formula if that makes sense which
is also why they are so pigmented
there's like a lot of pigment in these
bad boys and then of course I also love
that they are drugstore and they are
very affordable now cons on the product
there are a couple things I noticed
about these things I did not like one
thing that they get on my teeth a lot
like after I apply it I have to really
make sure that there
is nothing on my teeth I have to do the
little thumb trick and get some off the
center of my lips because it gets all my
teeth I don't know what it is about this
but it gets on my teeth so just make
sure that if you buy these you examine
your mouth before you walk out the door
also another thing I didn't like it does
feather and it does bleed throughout the
day you know how some creamy lipstick so
we'll just start to smear down your chin
yeah that happens with these so I
recommend using an anti feathering lip
liner the one that I use all the time is
the elf lip lock pencil it's just a
clear lip - a little broken it's just a
clear lip liner so what I do is I just
lined the outside of my lips like
literally the border of your lips and
then you apply the lipgloss on top and
it will not feather at all I love this
elf lip liner it is amazing I know
Milani also has one and so does urban
decay but this one works fine for me and
there is no feathering at all once I use
this so that that takes care of the
Federation problem so yeah those are the
only two things I noticed that I did not
like that I wish didn't happen but hey
they're cheap and they're good Oh
also they have a pleasant scent I know
that's a big deal for some people and it
smells like a baked goodie I don't know
what it is it doesn't smell like plastic
or you know it's no it's a pleasant
scent okay guys so that is at the end of
this review I hope you found this
informative at all I also have some of
the Milani brilliant shine lip glosses
