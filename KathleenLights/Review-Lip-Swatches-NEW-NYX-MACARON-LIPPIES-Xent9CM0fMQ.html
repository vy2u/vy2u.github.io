a review on the new mix macaron lippies
these aren't lipsticks that just
recently came out and they are inspired
by little macaroons I picked up the four
that seems the most wearable and then I
picked up one other fun color just to
try out because let's face it even
though blue lipstick is really really
cool I love blue lipstick I think it's
awesome it's not something I would
typically wear on a day-to-day basis or
even out honestly I never see myself
wearing blue lipstick and Danny would
seriously how hard is that give me saw
me wearing blue lipstick he gets grossed
out by red lipstick so imagine but yeah
I'm going to go ahead and get started
talking about these bad boys I ordered
mine online and it came in this really
really cute bag there's lace and it says
NYX and it also came with a free lip
liner I don't know if everybody got this
when they ordered theirs online as well
but this is in the shade nectar and it's
a metallic pink lip liner I honestly
don't see myself wearing this cuz it's
like super metallic but it's cool that
they threw this in the bag anyway I'm
also going to be showing you guys lip
swatches in this review of course you
guys know I always show you lip swatches
and yeah I'm just going to be telling
you my thoughts about them so the first
one what are we talking about is called
black sesame and it's the one that I got
that is the least wearable out of all of
them it is just a straight-up grey
lipstick not a very wearable color I
know but honestly I bought it to wear it
in the fall time with like a really
really dark lip liner I thought it would
be like your really cool effect in the
fall I don't know I know what I'm
talking about but it is very very creamy
and pigmented and rich but on my lips
for some reason it looks very blue I
don't know if it's just me but it comes
off like a bluegray more than anything
and I wanted it to be like a very true
cement great I'll probably have to use
like a darker gray lip liner underneath
just to get this true gray color but I
actually really really like it I think
it's going to be super fun and I
definitely
commend black sesame if you're into like
cool dark dead looking lips that sounds
awful but you know sometimes it's fun I
think I don't know this next one is
called lavender and it is the one that I
was the most excited for because it is a
baby lavender color and it is the one
that disappointed me the most which
really really sucks I broke mine on top
a little bit like I squished it but
besides that this color really
disappointed me because it goes on super
chalky I feel it is rich and creamy but
you cannot do too many coats of this on
your lips because the color just kind of
wipes away the more layers you add if
you know what I mean it's just kind of
patchy in some areas I think that if you
use a lip liner underneath it might
really work for you that's what I'm
going to do I'm going to try to find a
lip liner that's similar so maybe I will
get less patchiness and anyway this is
the kind of lipstick you're going to
want to use a lip liner with regardless
it was kind of hard for me to draw
inside of my lips with this color I
don't know why but even though it was a
little bit patchy and wasn't my favorite
I do still really like the color and
hopefully I can make it work this next
color is called rose and it is one of my
favorites I have two absolute favorites
and this is definitely one of them this
is a super super super bright bold pink
in-your-face but it's more of the
Bubblegum kind of pink it's not like a
hot pink it is a very pale bubblegum
pink like a true bubblegum pink in the
tube it actually looks darker than what
it looks like on my lips on my lips it
does look like a straight bubblegum
color so don't be fooled by the way it
looks in the tube because it comes off
more pale and like neon on your lips
this one was very very creamy and also
kind of hard to fill in my lips with
just because it was so opaque the
pigmentation on this one is unreal like
with just one swipe it is super super
super pigmented so I would definitely
try to use a lip liner with it because
it was hard to draw in my lips since it
was so so pigmented this next one is
called orange blossom and it is a very
very vibrant orange but it is different
on the lips than it is in the tube and
honestly for some reason I find this
color really really hard to wear I love
orange lipsticks that are like my
favorite colors to wear on my lips
and I will rock an orange lipstick any
day of the week but this one is just
kind of like so pale and I don't know
how to describe the color of this that
it's kind of hard to wear I don't know I
still like it I was hoping that it was
more similar to what it looks like in
the tube and what it is on my lips cuz
in the tube it just looks like a really
nice hot vibrant orange and that's just
not what comes off on the lips but it's
still a color that I will be wearing and
the last lipstick is in the color violet
and it is the one I'm wearing on my lips
right now and it is my absolute favorite
out of all the ones that I got this one
is the most creamiest the most pigmented
not patchy whatsoever the formula of
this one is the best out of all the five
that I got if you are just going to get
one of these lipsticks
please get violet because it is amazing
especially if you're into the bold
purple lip I swear no patchiness
whatsoever it goes on like a friggin
dream it's just like so nice and creamy
and so pigmented I love it I love the
bright purple lip and I really don't
have many colors that's similar to this
so I'm really really happy about this
color I really really love it okay so
overall I would say that these lipsticks
are pretty good I don't think they're
amazing I don't think they're great
aside from this beautiful purple one but
I still think they're good for the price
they were six dollars each and there
aren't many colors or aren't any colors
at all that are similar to this at the
drugstore
the only other brand that I know that it
has crazy colors they're similar to this
is lime crime and they expensive so for
the price you can't beat them and like I
said earlier they have a bunch of
different colors blues greens yellows
they have crazy colors I just picked out
the ones that I saw myself actually
wearing and even though these colors are
the more wearable ones of the bunch
they're still pretty intense and they
are not for the faint of heart if you
are not used to wearing bold bright
colors then stay away from these only
major downside of this product is the
freaking packaging for some reason once
you're applying your lipstick it kind of
like goes back into the tube like it
falls down and
the tube so you have to hold the clear
part while you apply it that's not a big
deal at all but I'm just you know
telling you guys what I do like about
the packaging though is that it does
look like when you put your lipstick all
the way in it locks you hear the noise
and then you know it locks close it and
you know it won't be like wiggling all
over the place so that's good anyways
those were my thoughts on the new NYX

video and I hope you enjoy my lip
swatches thank you so much for watching
