lip swatch video actually three things
because I also think I'm losing my voice
one the lip swatches you are about to
see are very very messy and I will go
into more detail in the review portion
of this video but very messy I'm sorry
please forgive me and let's try to look
past them and - if you don't follow me
on snapchat or Twitter I burned off my
eyelashes tell you more about it at the
end of this video ok back to the show
member
you
hey guys I don't need to tell you what
this video is about because we're like
halfway through this video already so if
you don't know what this video is about
by now but just in case today's video is
going to be a lip swatch video and a
review video and now that we are done
with the lip swatch portion of this
video I'm going to be talking to you
guys about the new colour-pop lippie
stix so color pop is constantly
releasing new colors like it feels like
they're releasing new colors every week
and whenever they come out with a set of
new colors I never do a whole specific
video about them but they came all with
a new formula so I really wanted to do
this video usually when they come up
with a new formula I sit down and talk
about it with you guys and so of course
when color pop came out with this new
matte ex formula in there lippie stix I
knew I wanted to talk about them so
basically they are their regular lippie
stix it's in the same packaging and
everything only like I said it's a new
formula they have a ton of different
formulas they have the sheer lippies the
cream lippies the statins the matte so
glossy finishes hyper glossy they have a
ton of different finishes now they have
matte ex
this formula claims to be a super super
matte finish but without the dry feeling
there's no tugging it's not a rough
formula and that's what color pop was
trying to achieve they also said that
this was the type of formula that you
only needed one swipe like with one
little swipe you get crazy intense color
payoff and that is 1000% true now with
that being said there are some things I
don't like about this formula so
initially the matte ex formula was
introduced when they came out with this
guy right here this is in the shade
trust me they kind of came out with this
like one-time limited edition color in
the new formula and I loved it when I
got trust me in the mail I was so
impressed because it is so insanely
pigmented it goes on so smooth no
cracking no cakiness
just like crazy matte color payoff it's
insane I literally thought they'd hit it
out of the park with this formula and
then they came out with pappan which is
this guy right here which I think they
came out with this when they hit 2
million followers on Instagram I think
that's when they released this color and
again same
goes with poppin amazing color amazing
formula so when they released all these
colors I was so excited I was ready to
just like go nuts with these but some of
these I'm gonna be honest I don't like
at all I'm not exactly sure when these
colors launch right now when I'm filming
this video I'm not 100% positive so I
will update you guys in the description
box come back in a couple days and I'm
sure I'll have that updated below or
follow me on snapchat because I will
update you guys when these launched on
snapchat as well since I really have no
idea okay so like you saw on my lips
these are very matte there are there's
like no shine to this product whatsoever
which is awesome if you're looking if
that's what you're looking for you know
you want a matte lipstick this is a
colour-pop lippie stick in the shade
blood it is a matte formula like their
original matte formula I'm gonna swatch
it on the back of my hand so this is it
right here you can see there's some
shine to it it's not glossy by any means
but it's not like completely matte now
I'm going to take pop in on the back of
my hand this is the matte ex formula I'm
also going to take shadow so you can see
the difference okay so you can see right
here this is blood they're regular matte
formula this is poppin and this is
chateau
they're matte ex formula much more matte
obviously as you can tell so this
formula is perfect for those of you who
were like man the original matte formula
wasn't as mad as I want it to be and
this is for you okay so as for cons I do
have a few of them but only in specific
colors I do think this formula is bomb I
think the formula is amazing but you
have to pick the right color I'm gonna
be completely honest not all of them
look the same you can't really tell on
camera I try to get close-ups but I
don't know if it came off as much as it
does in person some of these colors look
very very cakey at least on my lips I'm
just giving you guys my personal opinion
some of the colors looked very very
drying on me and I don't know if it's
because my lips are naturally pretty dry
but I've noticed that with a lot of neon
shades you have to have like almost a
perfect formula for a pastel neon to
look good and these past aliens don't
look good on me for example like topless
this really
insane beautiful orange when I looked at
my lips in the mirror they just looked
cracked uneven patchy I would try to go
over it to smoothen things out but it
would just end up looking worse and it's
not because it dried out because these
don't dry out like a liquid lipstick
they don't like suck the life out of
your lips it's just the way it looks on
the like of the pastel neon shades so
personally I did not like topless I
wasn't a huge fan of barely-there
just because it looked cakey and uneven
separate II that's not a word but it
looked like it just separated on my lips
it kind of sat on top and tickler did
give me that problem as well and then
the other shade I had a really big
problem with the patchiness was she bad
which I'm so sad this is their nude this
is like the most beautiful undertone I
love this nude so much and from far it
looks so beautiful like I want to
continue to wear it but it does it looks
kind of cracky and gross on my lips but
besides those colors that I mentioned
and maybe like another purple that I had
that problem with the rest apply
flawlessly just like popping and just
like trust me perfect very very
pigmented very very smooth I will also
say that another con I found with these
with all the colors is because it is so
pigmented and because it just glides
like you just barely have to move your
finger I found it a little bit difficult
to stay in my lip line like you
definitely 100% need a lip liner with
this because it can get messy very fast
so just warning you use a lip liner they
also sent with the PR package their
primer and I used the primer under some
of these especially the ones that I
didn't like just to see if the primer
made a difference and the primer did
make a difference with the neon colors
if I applied the primer first it didn't
look as cracky but it didn't make a
world of a difference you know what I
mean like it made a difference but not
mmm
but yeah that completes this video these
are my thoughts while some of these are
amazing some of these are not my
favorite also if you're wondering about
my eyelashes okay I kind of updated you
guys on snapchat and on Twitter but I
was sniffing a candle not this one but
pretend I was sniffing a candle I'm
gonna make a long story short I was
laughing about something like I was just
hysterically laughing I don't know what
I was doing but I was hysterically
laughing
and I went to smell a candle and the
heat of the flame like burned the tip of
my eyelashes off I don't know how but I
got really close and all of a sudden I
kind of felt kind of a little like a
little bit of a crunching on my lashes
and I burnt off the tips like I'm not
even joking I burnt off the tips and
these lashes are long and wispy and
these are stubby and short I'm gonna
have to use falsies for a few months
until they grow back I've been taking
all of your recommendations on Twitter
to use castor oil to help them grow I'm
gonna condition them I'm gonna work on
my lashes but if you're wondering why
I'm going to be using falsies for a
while in my tutorials that's why also
there's a lot of construction going on
in my home recently because we're
getting some things fixed in my house so
I'm not exactly sure if I can have a
video up on Wednesday I am gonna try my
best
hopefully I can record anyway and there
won't be too much noise maybe I'll make
it a voiceover I'll try to do my best to
get a video up but for the next like two
weeks I am gonna be having some
construction going on in my house so
sorry but it is going to be very very
noisy so it's almost like impossible to
film but I will I will work my way
around it okay so that's it thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye how I
don't know how but I was almost shocked
at how dry this made my hair it's a dry
conditioner it's supposed to add shine
and make your hair soft but it dried out
