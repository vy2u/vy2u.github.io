this is not a real tattoo and if it
looks familiar it is the tattoo that
Tris has in the movie divergent actually
bought divergent the day came out on
blu-ray and then it had these fake
little tattoos inside the DVD and I was
like I want to be Tris so I put on the
exact same tattoo that she has in the
movie because I don't know okay my DVD
why not today's video is going to be a
review and lip swatches on these lip
glosses by the balm and they're called
the read my lips lip glosses I actually
have had these lip glosses for about a
month or so I want to say and I wanted
to film this video when I got these lip
glosses but for some reason I didn't but
I'm kind of glad that I did wait so long
to do this video because I've had them
for so long already that I know exactly
what I feel about them and there's
actually 11 lip glosses in the entire
collection and I do have all eleven to
share with you guys I don't know if I
mentioned it but I'm gonna be doing lip
swatches as well you guys know I do lip
swatches I was actually really excited
to get these because I had wanted them
since the first time I saw them when I
thought they came out with this I was
like oh my god I really really want
those and actually tweeted I need those
read my lips lip glosses in my life and
then Courtney from the balm thank you so
much Courtney if you're watching this
video she sent me an email and she was
like hey I'm sending in the lip glosses
because I saw your tweet I hope you
really like them
and I was really really excited I was
like oh my god thank you so much you
know you didn't need to do that so these
were sent to me but I wasn't asked to do
a video on it she was honestly just
giving them to me just because she's
really really sweet like that but I'm
gonna do a video on them anyway because
I do have the whole collection and I
figure if anybody is looking into these
lip glosses they might want to see lip
swatches and they might want to see
opinions on them so yeah even though
they were sent to me
this isn't sponsored I wasn't I wasn't
asked to do this video I wasn't I'm not
paid my honest 100% review this is what
the packaging looks like my lights are
kind of washing them out a little bit
but it's really cute packaging it says
read my lips lip gloss and it has like a
comic book strip type of thing on the
packaging the bomb is so so like famous
for their packaging
I honestly think they have like the most
beautiful packaging out of all makeup
brands they're really good about it and
I love the bomb so much I'm a big fan of
their stuff and I'm a really big fan of
these lip glosses as well so anyway so
once you take the actual lip gloss out
this is what it looks like this is the
lip gloss in the tube they're pretty
long and I think that they're really
pretty and sleek it has like this little
thing on the lip gloss it kind of looks
like the path inge you know what I'm
saying like the comic book type of stuff
it's like a comic book theme here and it
just says lip gloss infused with ginseng
which is really cool actually that these
lip glosses are infused with ginseng
because ginseng is like a really good
antioxidant and stuff so it's kind of
nice that that's in these lip glosses if
you think about it so yeah before I get
into the lip swatches I will go ahead
and give you my full review on these
these videos are kind of longer I like
to go kind of like in depth with these
reviews though these lip glosses retail
for $15 on the balm website or anywhere
where you can get the balm and that is
pretty pricey but I do think that
they're worth it because they're they're
cheaper than a lot of lip glosses that
are high-end you know I'm saying it's
kind of like the in-between I think I
think the formula is really really nice
these are not sticky whatsoever out of
all the lip glosses that I've ever owned
in my entire life these are the ones
that are the least stickiest and I
definitely recommend this for someone
who hates the stickiness like myself
they're probably about as sticky as a
NYX butter gloss and if you're familiar
with those those aren't sticky another
great thing is that they are super super
pigmented I'm actually wearing this one
on my lips right now but I have it
sheared out so I just have it like
dabbed with my finger it can go a lot
more pigmented
this but they are all super super
pigmented with the exception of two
actually two of them are not so
pigmented but they're not sure either in
terms of what they smell like
to me they smell like a spicy cherry I
don't know if that makes any sense
they have like a cherry scent but today
some oh my nose for like a spicy cherry
like it it's a cherry with a kick to it
I don't know it's nothing that bothers
me and it's nothing that lingers on your
lips when you are applying it you
definitely smell like the cherry scent
so if you are somebody who's not into
those kind of sense if you like
something that's unscented this is not
for you because you definitely smell it
when you're applying it but I promise
you as soon as you're done applying it
you don't smell it anymore so that
doesn't bother me at all actually like a
scent I also love that these have a doe
foot applicator I know a lot of lip
glosses do but I love that they have a
doe foot applicator because I don't know
about you but if you've ever had those
lip glosses that is a brush like a brush
tip and when you go to apply it right
back into the tube like the brushes get
messed up and then you have like brushes
sticking out everywhere and then it's
really hard to apply I don't know I'm
not down with brush tip lip glosses oh
yeah overall I think they're great I
love them a couple things that I'm like
about them is that because they are not
sticky you will need to reapply these
throughout the day this isn't going to
be the type of product that you can put
on go out the door and expect to wear it
for like seven hours straight that's not
going to happen because they're not
tacky a lip gloss that is very very
sticky will stay on your lips for many
hours of the day because they are so
tacky and they're going to stay on your
lips that's just something you have to
take into consideration if you want a
lip gloss that isn't sticky then you're
gonna have to reapply throughout the day
which that's not something that really
bothered me especially for the nude
shades because they're just no-brainer
shades honestly you just stick them in
your purse and you're good to go
actually keep this lipgloss in my purse
all the time the one I'm wearing it's
probably my favorite one and it's just
so easy I do have to reapply throughout
the day not like constantly not like
every 20 minutes but it's easy to me I
have it in my purse and I just I love it
another thing is that the darker colors
and the range colors like this are a
little bit harder to apply because it is
a doe foot applicator you're not going
to get like a perfect sharp you know
application throughout your lips so I
definitely recommend using a lip liner
with the darker shades so yeah those are
the only like little negative things I
have to say but they're nothing that
bothers me so yeah now I'm just going to
go ahead and show you these lip glosses
on my lips I'm actually going to go one
by one tell you what I think about this
certain color just in case you're
interested in one particular color this
first one is called snap and it is your
typical nude I know in the packaging it
does look a little bit Brown a little
scary but it doesn't come off super
brown on the lips
keep in mind please guys that my lips
are very very very pigmented so certain
lip glosses are going to look different
on me but yeah this one is probably like
my second favorite out of the bunch it
is a beautiful nude color it does have a
little bit of Brown to it but it has
like a hint of pink as well
I honestly think of Kylie Jenner when I
see this I know like the Kylie Jenner
lip craze but I feel like this is the
Kylie Jenner color in lip gloss form
it's like that really nice brownie nude
it's just beautiful this next one is
called gir like huh kind of gir and it
is a beautiful beautiful mauve shade
this is also kind of like a nude color
but it has a lot of moth to it I really
love how glossy these look on lips they
give your lips incredible shine and they
make your lips look bigger than what
they are like it makes your lips look
really nice and pouty because it is so
glossy like when you first apply them
and it's just like it makes your lips
look juicy in my opinion it's just that
beautiful mauve everyday lip gloss
another great one to throw in your purse
this one is called Kabang I'm going to
I'm going to say the names like that
like really dramatic because that's what
I think in my head when I read this
Kabang and this is the only one out of
all of the 11 shades that I don't like
personally on me
like it has like that frosty weird color
to it but I know a lot of people love
shades like this if you're into colors
like this then go for it you know it's
just not my personal favorite and it
does leave my lips with glitter on them
like as the color fades throughout the
day they're still glitter remaining on
my lips which I'm not a fan of you know
this next one does another favorite and
it is called pop and it is a beautiful
orange coral color it's so pretty this
is one of the two shades that I said
that were not as pigmented as the rest
of them but they weren't super sheer
either obviously as you can see there is
pigment coming off on my lips but it's
not super super BAM like the other ones
but this one is so gorgeous especially
in the summer time like in the spring
and summer moving on to my favorite one
and this one is called BAM and it is BAM
so pretty it's the one I'm wearing on my
lips right now this is the perfect
everyday pink it's not very nude and
even though it's not like a super nudie
kind of pink I feel like it would look
good with a lot of different makeup
looks sometimes I feel like I can't wear
certain eye looks with certain pink
lipsticks because they clash but this
doesn't I recommend this one out of all
of them the most it's just so gorgeous I
love it so much this one is called zap
and it is another one that is a little
bit shimmery or a little bit frosty but
it I actually really really like this
one I don't know I just love the color
so much this is another one that is a
little bit sheer when you apply to the
lips this is the second one I was saying
that wasn't as pigmented as the rest but
I still like anyway I just think the
color is so so juicy and this looks
amazing or I'm talking amazing on top of
a pink lipstick like a hot pink lipstick
it just makes your lips looks so so
juicy this one actually isn't as
glittery as Kabang I had mentioned that
Kabang leaves my lips with glitter after
it has faded throughout the day but this
one doesn't do this next one is called
pow and it is amazing it is that
beautiful beautiful hot pink with purple
undertones like a fuchsia it's so
incredibly gorgeous it looks beautiful
on the lips and
your lips look nice and glossy it's so
so pretty especially with like a purple
lip liner this one looks really really
good with magenta lip liner from Mac if
you are into these fuchsia kind of lip
glosses this one is amazing this one is
called hubba-hubba and it is a really
pretty red with pink undertones like
when you look at it in the tube it looks
like it's just a typical red lip gloss
but there's a lot of pink undertone to
it's really pretty on the lips and it's
a nice alternative to just like a flat
red color I really like red lip glosses
or red lipsticks that have like that
pink undertone I'm a fan and this is a
good one this one is also another one of
my favorites and it's called wow and it
is wow it is your typical firetruck red
like that hot firetruck beautiful red
yeah this is it I am very much into red
lip glosses I think that they just make
your lips look nice and pouty and big
and luscious I love red lip glosses I do
recommend wearing this on top of a red
lipstick or on top of a red lip liner
like full your entire lips with a red
lip liner and then apply this on top
because I did mention earlier that these
do fade throughout the day so you don't
want to constantly be reapplying red lip
gloss because it's kind of hard unless
you have like a compact mirror it's
going to be a little bit hard to reapply
often so I definitely recommend using a
red lip liner under and then you're good
to go
this one's called Vava voom and it is
another red lip gloss but it's a very
deep red and this is for all you people
out there who love that dark red lip
it's just really really classic and
beautiful and looks amazing in the fall
time as well I tend to skip out on the
really bright red lipsticks in the fall
and go for like the more dark vampy red
lip and this one is is beautiful and
then the last one I'm gonna be sharing
with you is called boom and it is this
one and it is beautiful it is a dark
vampy lip not very similar to ba-ba-boom
actually it's more on the purp
sighs so it has more of that berry
purple undertone it looks really pretty
on the lips when you look at it in the
tube it kind of looks like it has
glitter in it but that does not come off
on the lips actually I just noticed that
for the first time right now but when I
have it on my lips I don't notice it
this one is going to look really really
pretty in the fall and like I said with
these darker colors make sure you use a
lip liner because dark lip glosses there
aren't made to last all day will fade
and get weird unless you have a lip
liner so yeah I hope this video wasn't
too long but those were my thoughts on
the bombs
read my lips lip glosses I really really
love them definitely check them out if
you're interested I just wanted to make
