a demo type of video it's also going to
be like mini reviews on this these are
the new bold metals collection by Real
Techniques they came out with brand new
brushes and I have all of them to share
with you guys today this video you guys
know I never lie to you guys this video
is sponsored by Ulta I want to just flat
out say that I want to make it a point
in any video that I ever do I don't do a
lot of sponsored videos at all actually
but whenever I do I want to make it very
clear this video is a collaboration with
Ulta they actually reached out to me and
asked me if I would like to demo these
in a video and I was really excited
because if you follow me on Twitter
which you should but if you follow me on
Twitter I tweeted like when I first
heard about these brushes I tweeted I
was like I don't care how much they are
I am buying those Real Techniques
brushes so I was planning on getting
these anyway so when I received that
email from Ulta asking me if I wanted to
demo these brushes I was really excited
you guys know how I am and I would only
do a sponsored video if I believed in
the product and I am a big fan of Real
Techniques alone as you can see I keep
all of my Real Techniques brushes in
this cup right here these are their
original brushes I've purchased all of
these myself so that is what this video
will be today I will give you my
thoughts on them and they will be my
100% honest opinions cuz you know that's
how I roll so yeah they are dirty
because I I just use them on my face but
I will insert clips of them clean you
know cuz they're a little dirty so
there's a lot of controversy going
around with these brushes and I will
tell you my thoughts and kind of like
I'll just give you some info on them
these are what the brushes look like
like I said they're from Real Techniques
and they are exclusively at Ulta I'm not
exactly sure if they have them on the
Real Techniques website but I know that
they are Ulta specifically there are
seven brushes in the collection you get
two gold ones these gold ones are called
the base brushes I have two brushes from
your base tokyo-based and then these two
are the rose gold ones and these are
called they're finishing brushes and
then you have three silver brushes and
these are their eye brushes I will do
close-ups I will zoom in I'll do all
that foil and I love the packaging or
like this the type of brush these are
pretty pricy brushes they're on the same
price as like Mac and stuff which is
very rare for real techniques because
they are an affordable brush brand but
I've actually was doing a lot of
research before this video and I was
watching their Channel
by the way if you don't know Real
Techniques is a brand owned by the pixie
wool sisters and I've been watching them
on YouTube for years they're probably
one of my favorite youtubers hands down
they're like amazing makeup artists
it took them a really really long time
to come up with these brushes and these
are like their luxurious brushes they
have the original ones that look like
this on the end they're the best
for the price these are amazing and so
they decided to come out with a more
luxurious line now a lot of people are
like oh that's kind of pricey for Real
Techniques but it's their luxurious type
of brushes if that makes any sense
that's like if right now Mac came out
with a line of brushes that were more
affordable these are their luxury
brushes and they definitely feel
luxurious you grab those and they're
great quality they're amazing they don't
shed they're fantastic and then you grab
these and they're like they're heavy
they're very very like you could tell
like a lot of money was put into these
brushes and they're they're just like
beautiful beautiful and what's crazy is
that when I received this in the mail I
first took it out of the box I was like
whoa these are heavy
um I thought it was just gonna be like
empty on the inside like if you were
gonna tap out that hurt like if you were
gonna like flick your finger and you
were gonna hear that like hollowness
like it was completely empty on the
inside but that is not the case they
feel very heavy especially this one
right here they feel so heavy they feel
so well made guys and I'm being a
hundred percent with you they feel very
well-made so I'm quickly going to just
touch base on the packaging
the rose gold ones are my favorite I
think they're beautiful but I really
love the gold ones as well what's really
nice about these brushes from Real
Techniques is that if you can tell the
original gold ones have yellow hair
coming out at the bottom like it starts
to fade until you like from yellow to
white to match the gold the rose gold
has pink and it starts to fade from pink
to white to match the rose gold and then
the same with the silver it goes from
like a gray to white and I think that's
such a beautiful little touch
these are definitely brushes that look
fancy and look nice
another great thing about these brushes
is that they're designed kind of like
diamonds I don't know if you can tell
they have like sides it's not a brush
that's completely round for example this
brush is a round like most brushes
they're round you put them on the table
and it you know it glides these brushes
the way that their bodies are they don't
go anywhere and pixie woo sisters um
purposely made them like this so that
you could put your brush on a vanity and
that it would and it wouldn't roll off
which is kind of like a dumb little
thing but it's actually really cute that
they did that okay now so in terms of
quality these brushes are incredibly
soft this is the softest one and it's
just like they're all really soft that
this has the most hair so oh it's so
soft they are just a little bit softer
than these and these are already soft
but they are softer than those now
what's cool about these brushes is that
every single brush is tapered like on
the sides it goes from like short to
long they're tapered like this so that
they can mimic real hair like brushes
with real hair but all of these brushes
are synthetic which is really important
for a lot of people some people only
have or only buy synthetic brushes and
these are all synthetic every single one
is synthetic but the way that it's cut
and the way that it feels they tried to
mimic real hair and in one of the videos
that I was watching the pixie blue
sisters said that they're not only glued
into the barrel but they're tied as well
so that it won't shed it won't shut okay
so with that being said I will go
through each brush tell you my thoughts
and demo them for you so let's get
started I'm going to start off with the
base brushes the base brushes are these
two gold ones now I don't have a demo
for you for this one because I just
don't exactly know how to use it yet
this is the 101 triangle foundation
brush it has the number at the back 101
now I saw one of the pixie Wu sisters
demoing this and it looked like it would
apply your foundation really nicely but
I am not used to a brush like this for
foundation personally I like a buffer or
a sponge most of time I really like
sponges with my foundation so I didn't
really know how I would use this it is a
really cool concept
it's a triangle kind of thing so the way
that she used that she painted it on her
face and then flipped it to get the
triangle right you know in these parts
but this is the only brush that I'm like
I don't get it I'm being completely
honest with you guys you know I don't
lie so this one I'm like how am I gonna
use this I just I don't know this brush
retails for I have the prices right in
for me
this brush retails for $23.99 now like I
said these are expensive brushes because
they are their luxury brushes and I'm
not lying guys these feel like luxury
this next one I love to death this is
the 100 arched powder brush this is the
softest brush ever ever it's amazing and
this is perfect for setting your face
because it's so big but it's a paddle
style brush which is my favorite I don't
typically love brushes that are powder
brushes that are big and fluffy all
around because I feel like you could
only use them for powder but this you
just lay it flat on your face you could
set your foundation and you could use
this for bronzer that is what I used it
for today because it is tapered as nose
you can see it's like a paddle it's
tapered like this this is perfect to get
right into your cheeks to give you like
a very soft contour I wouldn't say this
is a contouring brush by any means
because it is big and fluffy but I just
bronze my face with it really nicely I
used my Jane cosmetics bronzer to do
that it's a warm product but I wasn't
trying to contour or any
and I feel like it distributed the
product nicely what I love about this
brush is that it's not super dense and I
love that I don't know if you can tell
but when you look it you see like it
just it's not dense so it blends the
product really nicely I highly recommend
this one this one is $25.99 and worth
the $26 in my opinion okay so let's talk
about the rose gold brushes which in my
opinion are the prettiest to look at and
these are their finishing brushes that's
what they call them so this one right
here is number 301 and this is their
flat contour brush now I really like
this I'm gonna be completely honest when
I got this in the mail I was like oh I'm
not gonna like this this is way too
dense like when you you see it's it's
not like the NARS eita brush that's
really soft and fluffy I don't have that
one because that suspensive but um this
doesn't feel like that this is a very
densely packed um
brush so I was like hmm I don't know I
don't know but I used it today for cream
contouring now cream contour is
something that I've always kind of
struggled with a little bit because it
is harder to do in my opinion I feel
like cream contouring is a little bit
harder to blend with just any brush so I
used it today I actually just used my
Maybelline fit me foundation this is the
stick one I used this and I drew it on
my face and then I started to buff it
out with this brush and I was pleasantly
surprised to see how easy it blends out
cream products so this is perfect for
cream contouring because it is so dense
I don't know I haven't used it with a
powder contour it might work like that
perfectly fine to just contraire your
face with a powder with this as well but
I find that because it's so dense it
blends out cream flawlessly on the skin
and I get the most natural cream contour
ever even though the brush is very
densely packed the hairs are super super
incredibly baby soft so don't think that
because it's dense it's like a rough on
the skin it's not it's very soft you
know because it is so dense this might
also be great to put on your foundation
I took it into the nooks and crannies
and like buff it because it's a you know
it's dense and it would both the
foundation really nicely and get like
right in here and in between my forehead
I think I'm onto something
this retails for $25.99 okay so the
second brush in this little rose gold
line this is the number 300 and this is
their tapered blush brush what no
they're tapered blush brush okay
this is my favorite brush hand down guys
if you are going to pick up any brush or
any two brushes but if you're going to
pick up any brush out of this whole
collection I highly recommend going with
this one this does so many things talk
about a real multitasker I promise you I
used this today for my under eye
concealer so I grabbed my Maybelline fit
me
this isn't sponsored by Maybelline I
just really like Maybelline products so
I just grabbed Mike my Maybelline fit me
and I'd added it dotted it dotted it can
I speak today I put it all over my under
eyes highlighted with it as well did all
that stuff and then I took my brush and
I started to blend it really really
nicely onto my face what I love about
this brush is that it's tapered to kind
of like eight-point it's a it's also in
that paddle style it's a paddle style
brush but it tapers to like a really
nice point and that point gets really
really close underneath your eyes and
then I kind of just cleaned it off on a
like a spot cleaning kind of thing I did
a quick spot cleaning and then I applied
some powder underneath my eyes I just
dabbed it into my powder and I set my
under eye concealer with this and of
course because of the shape it sets my
under eye can see there really nicely
you know it's a it's a great little
brush this is also amazing to contour
with I didn't use it in the demo but
I've used it to contour since I got it
conk with powder contour and it's so
nice because it's so like tapered and
perfect this little thing right here
gets so perfect into the hollows of your
cheek bone this is an amazing contour
brush not only that I mean this does say
this does say it's a blush brush I
didn't put on blush today and it's too
small for me and my personal opinion
it's too small for blush for me but I
swear it does it all I also used it
today to highlight my
face I use my physician's formula Miami
strip my Holy Grail
um highlight and I just highlighted the
tops of my cheekbones nice wings thank
you
Hey and it gave it such like a nice
highlight this is a very intense
highlight on its own but because of the
way that the brush is tapered you can
either do a really light hand or a
really heavy hand and it applies the
product so nicely this one is $23.99
okay and last not least let's talk about
the silver brushes and these are the eye
brushes as you could tell so this one
right here is the 201 brush this is
their pointed crease brush now um at
first I was like what how am I gonna
yeah this is a very densely packed brush
the way that I have liked to use this
since I got it I really liked using it
to blend out like my concealer onto my
eyes or my Paint Pots or anything like
that
I used my benefit stay don't stray and I
applied it to my eyes and then I just
kind of buffed this into my eye to kind
of make everything look nice and
seamless and what I really like about
this brush I didn't think I would but it
gets perfectly underneath my eyebrows
because it goes to a really nice point
you can get that perfect position per
second you can get that perfect
precision present precision you can get
that perfect precision oh my gosh you
can get that perfect precise application
which I really really like I also use
this brush to highlight the inner parts
of my eye like my inner corner because
it does come to like a nice little point
fun retails for $15.99 this next one is
a it's called the two hundred oval
shadow brush and is another favorite of
mine I love it for so many reasons I
love the shape of it it's like a big
think of like a flat shader brush but
like a big version and a fluffier
version so it's kind of different you
can use it for different things so what
I've used it for today is I just got
like my my powder like my setting powder
and I dipped it into the powder and I
applied it to my entire lid to set the
like base I had put down before and then
I just
my Physicians Formula like my same
highlight my face highlight and I dipped
it into the bronzer shades and I applied
it to my entire lid this is the perfect
brush to put like a really quick wash of
color not only can you pack on some
color to the lid but once you twist it
on its side because it is fluffy it gets
perfectly into the crease so this is a
perfect brush to apply something on the
lid and then just grab it and put it
right into your crease it's not too too
dense or too too harsh you know so it
does it does a lot of things at once and
then I just dipped it into the lightest
shade and used it as a brow bone
highlight as well because I love like
kind of like fluffy brushes like this to
highlight my brow bone
this also retails for $15.99 and then
the last brush I will be talking about
is this guy right here this is the 202
angled liner brush now this one I love
and I hate like I have a love-hate
relationship with this one and I love it
because it is time me this is so tiny
that when I was doing my winged today I
feel like it was so incredibly easy to
do my wing I know if I'm not about you
guys but it's so hard to do my wing and
most the time I don't do it on camera
because it's just hard to do but this is
so so freakin small so freakin small
that I feel like it made just thin
little line it was a lot it was really
easy to do the only thing I don't I
sound a love-hate relationship the only
thing I don't like is that it's not it's
really skinny but it's not so
so like crisp paper-thin that you can't
get a very very very very sharp wing
look you can see like this one my wing
looks like right now and even though I
really really like it and I kind of like
it like this but if you want a super
crisp like you want the pointiest point
to his point to his wings this is not
going to give it to you because it is
just not like it's not as thin as paper
this also retails for $15.99
okay guys so I hope this video wasn't
too long but I just wanted to give you
like throw in for me but I just wanted
to give you like thorough information on
these products I know a lot of people
are going to complain about the price
and I absolutely agree with you 100%
pricey but they are worth the money I
don't think every single one you need to
go buy every single one but I highly
highly recommend these two right here
actually I really like this brush a lot
a lot I highly recommend these three
right here and if you're into cream
contouring this one's a fabuloso I don't
thank you guys for your constant support
every single day and all the love that
you give me I appreciate it so much and
