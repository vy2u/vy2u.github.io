a review and swatches have a video on
eyes shadows that I have been recently
introduced to and they are crazy good
and they are color pop eyeshadows their
individual eyeshadows but they're so
inexpensive they're very affordable
they're five dollars each and you can
get these at color pop calm I will leave
the website down below if you want to go
check these out they are so good I will
be giving you my thoughts and showing
you swatches on my hand of these
eyeshadows I have 12 to share with you
guys today I kind of been hearing some
buzz about these eyeshadows for about a
month now but I didn't think they were
this pigmented and like metallic they're
definitely not your typical eyeshadows
though it's not a powder it is
definitely more of a cream finish like
when I dip my finger in this it feels
almost wet to the touch and look at that
look at my finger
look at that they're just insane and so
worth the price and I really wanted to
film this video because the second that
I got them in the mail and I started to
play around with them they reminded me a
lot a lot of the Stila magnificent metal
eyeshadows if you're familiar with the
seal of magnificent metal eyeshadows
they also have that creamy wet texture
to them when you touch them and they're
all really really metallic and really
beautiful as well but these retail for
$32 each and this is $5 and honestly I
would pay $32 for these because I like
this texture and I like this type of
eyeshadow someone who has always been
interested in trying this product but
didn't want to spend $32 on it I
definitely recommend colour-pop
eyeshadows because it's like the same
thing also these steal eyeshadows come
with like a little dropper like a little
bottle that has a mixing medium in it
that you can use in conjunction with the
eyeshadow to make it just even more
intense and obviously these don't come
with that but you can use anything you
can use mac fix+ you could use eye drops
anything and they mix really well with
this because it is a cream finish it's
not going to disturb this product
whatsoever sometimes I will
use mac fix+ on an eyeshadow and it will
kind of mess up the eyeshadow because it
is a powder finish and it's not intended
to be used with mac fix+
but these are like what and creamy and
they work really well actually this elf
makeup lock and seal is like the perfect
combination with this if you want this
to look even more metallic and even more
intense
I recommend the elf makeup lock and seal
and it's like three dollars so I mean
I'm hooking you up here great great
great combo okay so I'm going to go
ahead and share these swatches with you
guys because I know that's what you want
to see by the way all the eye shadows on
my eyelids except like my brow bone
highlight is from colour-pop cosmetics
actually filmed a really quick eye
tutorial right before I'm filming this
on this little eye look right here but I
don't know if I'm going to put it up
comment down below if you want to see a
tutorial on this look because if you do
then yeah I'll put it up so when you
order them online they do come in this
little box right here and then you open
it and then it's the actual eye shadow
and then when you turn it around it does
have the name of the eye shadow right on
the back so I'm going to start off with
this one this is the color I have all
through my crease right now and it is
called smash and it is a beautiful tan
color with a little bit of like a gold
Sheen I do have this one in my crease
because it's not glittery or like too
sparkly and it does work well in the
crease it just gives you a nice glow to
the eyes I definitely recommend this one
this one is so pretty for everyday or
anything like that and I will say that I
do recommend to use these eyeshadows
with your finger they applied the best
with your finger I'm not like a huge fan
of how they apply with the brush
personally you just get such a nice
pigment with your finger this one
actually surprisingly worked really well
with a brush in my crease I used like a
synthetic blending brush and just buffed
it really nicely in my crease and I got
a lot of good pigment from that probably
because it isn't like a glittery sparkly
color it's kind of like a satin finish
to this one so that's why it was
probably easier to build up in my crease
but nonetheless this color is so
beautiful to just throw on your whole
lid buff it into the crease and that's
it you got your eye look and it was like
five seconds so pretty by the way I did
go ahead and choose more neutral shades
because
I'm a neutral kind of gal I do have a
couple of little pops of color here and
there but most of it is neutral because
I wanted to pick out colors that I would
wear the next one doesn't have a name on
it I don't know why I guess the sticker
fell off but I'm pretty sure this one is
called desert and this one is gorgeous I
don't know if you can tell by the way
that when you first get these little
eyeshadows they have like a snake print
on them I don't know if you can tell or
you can see it because I've been likes
watching all of them
so the pattern kind of blends it away
but it's still really cool anyway this
one is so pretty it has a very warm
camel color to it so nice in the crease
as well if you were someone who likes
those warm Browns that have a little bit
of an orange undertone this one is
really pretty and it also works in the
crease you don't really need to use your
fingers with this one I find with a
brush it also works but I love about
these eyeshadows is that they're
literally color pops like they are a pop
of color on the lid personally I think
they work best paired off with powder
eyeshadows like you can do a whole look
with like any regular eyeshadow and then
grab one of these and like tap it in the
center of the lid and it will transform
your look immediately so nice paired
with just basic neutral regular
eyeshadows love it okay so this next one
is called three like the number three
and mine came a little bit broken but
that's okay because the color is perfect
one of those eyeshadows that in the
light looks brown and then when you move
it around it kind of has like a purple
hint to it somewhat does have hints of
like little purple or blue glitters in
it and it is so so stunning this next
one is called animal and it is a really
hot - like vibrant coral shade this one
would have been so perfect like
throughout the entire summer it is so
beautiful this one feels like mu C on
the skin like not so much wet like the
other ones almost like a mu C texture
this one does have some gold flecks
throughout it but you can't really tell
on the eyes all that much you can
definitely see like there's a little bit
of Sheen to it it's not completely like
matte on the eyes but still so pretty
nonetheless if you're into coral
eyeshadows this one is so pretty this
next one is definitely one of my
favorites definitely top three most
beautiful ever and it is called game
face and look at it you know you know
you guys know I'm crazy about coppers
and colors
like this this one is so intense and
pigmented you can see it like in the
light it shines like it shines it's so
gorgeous this one feels like extra wet
and creamy and the pigmentation is so
pretty it's like a very metallic copper
color these kind of colors work in the
fall and in the summertime such an
overall gorgeous metallic finish this
one is another favorite of mine and I
feel like it would be a lot of people's
favorite and it is called I heart this
like I a little harder than this I heart
this it's so pretty it's like a topi
color and the sheen on this is
incredible this is the only one I will
say that you really have to kind of pack
on the lid because it can be a little
bit glittery and chunky but that's what
I really really like about this all you
have to do is add like fix+ or a mixing
medium and the pigmentation on this is
incredible if you're only going to buy
three out of all the ones I'm going to
show you today this one is definitely
one of them if you're into super flashy
metallic glittery eyes because this does
have a little bit of like a glittery
sheen to it but it is so pretty mixed
with fix+ you have no idea this next one
is really really cool it is called
frisky and it is a black eye shadow with
a bunch of blue little glitters going
through it and you can see when I turn
it it looks like a deep blue and then it
looks black it's it's amazing this would
look so beautiful with like a sticky
blue base underneath like a blue NYX
jumbo eye pencil as your base and then
this on top it would just stick to it
and make the glitters shine and look so
vibrant on your eyes definitely
something a smokey lover would really
like okay now I'm going to show you my
all-time favorite my top favorite the
prettiest one out of all twelve that I
own absolutely gorgeous and it is called
get lucky and it is the eye shadow I am
wearing on my lids right now it is a
metallic true gold color and the only
other eye shadow that I feel is similar
is Urban Decay's half-baked but this one
is 10 times better and ten times more
intense and pigmented but it's that true
gold color if you know what I mean this
one you can tell instantly it's
different like when I touch it so so
creamy and buttery like look at that
sheen on my finger it
insane it glides on the eyelid there is
no patchiness to this eyeshadow
whatsoever it's probably the least
patchy Asst i shadow i have ever come
across in my entire life
this next one is for a lilac e purple
lover and it is called eye candy your
topi purple pinky color I really don't
know how to explain this but there's a
little bit of taupe to it I feel this is
another one that would look really good
and mixed with fix+
to get that super vibrant intensity but
nonetheless it's so so pretty it has
like little flecks of silver stuff in
there and it's just it's really nice the
next one is called Liberty and it is an
tans girl it is intense it is a super
metallic silver it's probably the most
foiled one out of all of them like as
soon as you swatch it you're like whoa
whoa I need glasses that's ready my eyes
that's too metallic not too metallic
metallic in all the right ways like so
so incredible if you were into metallic
eyeshadows Liberty is so nice this next
one is also really cool and it is called
BAE like BAE like you my BAE yeah it's
called babe and this one is so
incredibly unique like the second I
opened it I was like ooh that is pretty
it looks like a regular dark eyeshadow
but when you turn it in sunlight it
looks purple and then when you turn it a
different way it looks blue so it's that
dual chrome of blue and purple so pretty
also another smokey lovers favorite it
comes off a lot more purple on the
eyelids but when you turn certain ways
you do see a little bit of the blue
flecks in it but it's like a deep purple
so so pretty and then the last one I'm
going to be sharing with you is called
so Kish so cliche I need to learn how to
read I don't know how to say this this
one is also really really unique and I
think a lot of people are really going
to love this shade another one that's
like two-toned will do a chrome like two
different colors in one when you look at
it it kind of looks bronzy but then
there's a lot of pink to it there's a
bunch of pink little glitters throughout
the whole thing that kind of transformed
the eyeshadow be pink glitters really
stand out on your eyes and it's just
pretty okay guys so those are all the
swatches of the 12
