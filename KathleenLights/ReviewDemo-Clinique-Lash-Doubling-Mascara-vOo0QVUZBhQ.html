filming this video at five o'clock and
it's like dark outside
I see myself pretty dark in the
viewfinder just I'm a fool like that but
I wanted to kind of do a review on a
mascara that I think is phenomenal and I
know you're probably wondering like
girls atmosphere was been around since
like 1987 it has yeah probably not 1987
but it's been around for a very long
time and I wanted to do a review on it
because I don't see a lot of people
talking about it on YouTube in fact I've
been watching YouTube for awhile and I
don't hear anybody talking about this
and I'm thinking that's probably cuz it
sucks but no it doesn't it's my favorite
mascara it's amazing it's the Clinique
lash doubling mascara mascara double
volume and this thing this this little
guy is fantastic I love this mascara I
am going to show you a demo I'm going to
show you I'm going to show a clip of me
applying it and just like a side-by-side
comparison to my fair lashes and to
another mascara I go into detail but
really quickly I just kind of wanted to
show you the packaging this is what it
looks like it's it's Clinique and the
wand is just a regular wand I show you
an up close very soon it's one of those
bristled wands it's not a rubber wand
I don't like rowboat roba I don't like
rubber ones they just they've never seem
to work for me regular bristles are the
kind of mascaras that I tend to go for
and again really fast before I show you
the clip I wanted to explain my the type
of lashes I have because people like
mascara for different reasons I don't
have long eyelashes but they're not
short either they're kind of medium
length they're not super long they're
not super shorts are just average in the
middle and I like mascara that gives me
volume so whenever I go buy mascara I
look for ones that are voluminous but
they give you length too and
this does that so I'm going to go ahead
and get into the clip okay so what I'm
going to do to show you how well this
mascara works is I'm not going to be
curling my lashes at all because I want
you to see um the curl that this mascara
gives on its own and I'm going to be
doing this I only I'm going to do one
coat and then compare it to my bare
lashes and then I'm gonna do another
coat and compare and then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take my Maybelline
the colossal volume express mascara and
I'm going to do this eye and the reason
why I chose this mascara is because I
know it's a holy grail to a lot of
people and a lot of you absolutely love
this mascara so I wanted to show you
like side by side just to sort just to
show you how amazing this mascara so
this is what the brush looks like up
close as you can see there's not much
there's nothing special about this
really I do like the fact that goes from
fat to skinny like it from oh what's
that I don't know what that was but um I
like the fact that it goes from thick to
thin because it helps to get you know in
those areas yeah
it's really hard to record yourself
putting on mascara and not get out of
the frame because you're looking in a
separate mirror so bear with me people
so this is a mascara with just one coat
on my top and bottom lashes I have like
one extremely long lash happens with
every mascara I don't know this like
little strand of lash right here just
has a mind of its own and just sticks up
like alfalfa really weird I don't know
but yeah as you can see it's really
volumizing and it does lengthen a lot
I've had this mascara for a little over
three months maybe a little more I don't
know I'm bad when it comes to that but
so it does clump a little bit faster now
than it did two months ago you know so
keep that in mind this isn't completely
new but I think this mascara is amazing
as you can see with just one coat it
makes such a crazy difference I
absolutely love this I just I love this
so much
um so I'm not gonna do two coats I was
gonna do two coats of each mascara but
decided to just keep it at one coat just
so you can see honestly
I don't do two coats with this mascara
it's I think it's amazing with one coat
honestly I do so I'm going to go ahead
and do this I with the colossal volume
here like I'm not in focus
okay so this is one coat of the
Maybelline colossal value vol I say vol
I say that we're really weird I don't
know um I don't know can you tell the
difference I can I mean it's not a huge
it's not a huge difference but I really
I really can tell the difference this I
has a lot more volume and has its
thicker around the lashes I feel like
this does give you volume but the
Clinique lash doubling gives you a
little bit more length if you can see
there and because the colossal volume is
so wet I feel like it clumps a little
bit quicker than the lash w eyelash
doubling is in a wet formula at all it's
not like a dry formula but it's not wet
so yeah I just I honestly think that
this eye looks better but that's just my
opinion so so as you saw in the demo um
the clinic lash I have mascara all over
the place
the Clinique lash doubling mascara gives
you volume and length and it might be a
little weird that I wanted to show you
kind of in comparison of the colossal
volume but it is loved among a lot of
people and it is a very good mascara
it's it's a good it's a good mascara and
I just kind of wanted to show you in
comparisons because I wanted to compare
a great mascara to a mascara that I also
think is good but I don't think it's as
good but it's good so I just I just want
more people to know about this mascara
because I know the clinic isn't as
popular as benefit and Mac and because
when you think Clinique you think like
skin care at least I do I think of like
for mature I feel like clinic is like
for mature women and they deal with like
making your skin better and they're you
know they're they cater to your skin a
lot but you never really think of a
mascara when you think of clinic a good
there at least I never did I got a tiny
one I got a sample of this years ago and
I was like blown away I recommend this
mascara so much
it is a pricy mascara since its from
Clinique it's not a drugstore one but
compared to like benefits they're real
or like the Dior show that a lot of
people love this is fifteen dollars
fifteen or sixteen dollars or somewhere
than that so it's not a cheap mascara
but it's not really expensive like half
of the high-end ones that you see it's
like six dollars more than your
drugstore mascara so I mean I just I
love it so much and I can't get enough
of it and I continue to repurchase this
over and over again um yeah so that was
my review sort of is my first review and
it was probably an epic disaster I don't
even know if I wasn't focused the whole
time it was probably a hot mess but you
know what whatever I just wanted to get
the word out I just wanted I just wanted
people to know I want people to know
that this is the business okay just I
just wanted people to know thank you so
much for watching please subscribe I
would greatly appreciate it and now see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
