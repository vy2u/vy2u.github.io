going to be the writer dye makeup tag
slash makeup look it's not going to be a
full-on tutorial but I do want to show
you my writer dark products in action I
had tweeted saying that I wasn't going
to do this tag because I did a similar
video to this about five months ago
where I took a product from each
category and I showed you my all-time
favorite and I did that for a drugstore
and high-end like I did two separate
videos it was called my favorite makeup
of all time something like that so when
I tweeted that I wasn't gonna do it a
lot of you guys were like do it anyway
and then so many of you guys gave me the
idea to turn it into a tutorial so that
is what I'm gonna be doing today I'm
gonna link Jacqueline Hills a video down
below because she created this
ride-or-die tag so you want to see her
Rhino joy makeup products I will link
her below so I'm gonna get started I'm
so sorry that my recent videos like all
of them have been pretty chatty hmm I'm
sorry I also want to give you guys a
little bit of a disclaimer 90% of these
products are high-end and I'm so sorry
about that it's just when I think of
like my ultimate favorite most of it is
high-end it wasn't on purpose it's just
these are my ride-or-die products and I
don't want to lie to you guys my number
one primer is the Too Faced hangover x
hangover RX face primer replenishing
face primer with coconut water probiotic
based ingredients and skin revive errs
this is also silicone free I have very
dry skin so I look for moisture in a
primer and this one is just my favorite
because it sinks right into the skin so
it doesn't feel like a heavy moisturizer
but it gives you a nice base to apply
makeup on it's amazing for foundation my
ride-or-die is the makeup rubber face
and body foundation now this is being
discontinued unfortunately they are
replacing the face and body with the
water blend very similar formulas but I
do prefer the face and body this one's
still good I just like this one a little
bit more I don't really like change so I
do like to shake this up and usually I
apply all my foundations with a Beauty
Blender but for this specific foundation
I like using a brush because it is
mainly water-based and if I used a
Beauty Blender it would just soak up all
of this my favorite brush to apply this
foundation has been the jus vias j11
three-round buffer from julius please
and I just like to squirt this
foundation
on the brush I use a lot of this
foundation but that's because it is such
a sheer coverage but it has 1.69 fluid
ounces so it has more than your average
foundation so the way that I like to
apply this foundation I like to bounce
this into my skin so I start in little
sections with a bouncing motion so it
takes me a while to put this foundation
on I'm not going to lie so the reason
why this is my rider diet is because
every time I wear this foundation I get
complimented on my skin every single
time and this is the foundation I wear
to events because it looks great in
photos it looks great in the daytime it
looks great at night time a lot of
people always tell me like you don't
even look like you're wearing foundation
and I love that because when your skin
looks like skin that's an awesome
compliment now my skin has been breaking
out really badly recently not like
breaking out in huge pimples but my skin
is doing some weird thing and it's all
over my chest a lot of you guys are
telling me it's because my skin is like
detoxing because I'm eating so healthy
these days and my body is like doing a
detox I don't know if that's true but
hopefully that goes away soon but if you
do have a lot of acne scars or like
pigmentation issues this might be too
sheer for you now I'm gonna go in with
concealer and this one was really hard
for me because the NARS radiant creamy
concealer has been my ride-or-die for a
long time now I've gone through so many
tubes of this I will say it is my
ride-or-die because it's the one I've
used so long but I think I might like
the Tarte shape tape concealer a little
bit more this one might be my new
all-time favorite yes I'm gonna go with
the Tarte shape tape because I just I
love it so much definitely my all-time
favorite concealer I know it's so soon
to say that but I just I love it I still
love my NARS radiant creamy that's
definitely a super close second like
super close
I'm just gonna buff this in with the
same brush I was using
I'm also going to drag that on to my
eyes I don't really have a favorite
eyeshadow primer to be completely honest
with you because I used concealer so
often as primer I have very dry eyelids
so eyeshadow doesn't typically crease on
me so I'm actually I actually don't have
anything for that category then I just
usually use my concealer this concealer
is really awesome because it doesn't
really crease that much all of my other
concealers crease more compared to this
one I don't know what's so special about
this one but sometimes I even forget to
set it which is crazy of thing I'm gonna
take a little bit of my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in vanilla just to try
to hide that little sucker right there
okay so I know that there's two
categories for powder space powder and
under-eye powder but I'm just going to
go ahead and combine the two and talk
about my RC ma no color powder this is
my favorite powder of all time I do
really love other powders like their
powders that have come really close to
this but when I sit down and think what
is my all-over like amazing powder RC
I'm a no color powder but this is just
so good to set your under-eye concealer
it's almost traceless like you cannot
see this on the skin it's fabulous and
it's only $12 so affordable and so good
so I like using this to set my under
eyes and to set my whole face I don't
really set my ho entire face that often
but this one does it really well so I
just went ahead and set my entire face I
don't like to set my entire face when I
use this foundation because I love the
dewy effect that that foundation gives
me but I don't know just decided to set
my whole face please someone leave me a
comment down below on how I can help out
my chest pimples that are happening it's
like all over my chest okay so I'm going
to quickly touch base on my favorite
brow products I don't really use brow
wax or brow pomade I am more of a brow
pencil kind of gal I have to go with
this one this is the Anastasio brow wiz
it's probably my favorite brow product
because it just lasts so long on my
brows I don't know what's in this
formula but it lasts all day there are
really good dupes out there but this is
the one I just grabbed the most
I also love their brow definer and my
all-time favorite brow gel is the Loreal
brow stylist plumper it doesn't even
have like the name on it anymore because
I've used this so much I like the shade
light to medium because it kind of gives
my brows a highlighted look love this it
keeps my eyebrows in place it's just the
best I love it way more than any other
high-end brow gel I've ever ever ever
used okay so now I'm going to talk about
my favorite contour powder actually my
favorite contour kit I'm just going to
throw this in there when I want to
contour the Too Faced cocoa contour kit
is my favorite I love it way more than
the Kat Von D one I love it way more
than the anastacio one my mirror broke I
hate that I will say I don't love the
packaging I think it's a little bulky I
think it could be thinner I don't like
this at all it's like glittery and weird
but these three shades I love I mean you
can tell like cocoa is like one of my
favorites I love using light cocoa to
highlight underneath the eyes and medium
cocoa is my favorite contour powder ever
and whenever I just want to bronze up
the skin even more I go in with dark
cocoa but mainly light cocoa and medium
cocoa are like heaven for me I
absolutely love them so if we're going
to talk about an actual bronzer my
ride-or-die is the girl lactic matte
bronzer in the shade Cabo I love this
bronzer because it's not too warm but
it's not a cool bronzer either it gives
me enough warmth without looking orange
I'm gonna add just a little bit of this
because I feel like it went a little
heavy with the contour and this bronzer
is super pigmented so I'm just gonna
warm up the cheeks a little bit I also
really love the formula of this bronzer
it's not just the color that I liked the
formula it looks really really smooth on
the skin I'm gonna drag this down to my
neck because well my face is looking
like a different
they're a little bit okay so next
category is blush and actually went back
and forth between this one and Milani
between this one and Milani baked blush
in Luminoso that is my second favorite
blush of all time I always take that
with me to travel but if I'm gonna be
completely honest like which one do I
use way more it's always NARS madly NARS
madly is like the strangest blush
because when I first went to buy it I
applied it to the back of my hand and it
looked like nothing like it just looks
like a pinky nude not much to it but I
actually love how it looks on the face
it goes with every single makeup look
dark smoky eye light smoky eye bear eyes
it just goes with everything I love it
so much okay so for highlight this was
also really hard for me because I was
almost positive I was gonna include the
Laura Mercier
baked highlight and zero one it's like
the matte baked highlight that is
probably my all-time favorite highlight
but it was kind of a tie with this one
and when I look back to see which one
I've used more it is this one this is
the Physicians Formula shimmer strip in
Miami strip I only focus on these top
three colors I love them both for
completely different reasons but I've
just used this one more often but
seriously that one is also my
ride-or-die light this one has a very
strange formula this one is kind of
stiff when you rub your fingers in it
but I find that that really helps with
the longevity like for some reason I
find that this highlight lasts forever
on my skin and I'm honestly just going
to add a little bit of this
okay I'm sorry I have to mention this I
have to it's also my ride-or-die I love
these two the same so I'm going to take
my met radiance baked powder highlight
in zero one by Laura Mercier and I'm
gonna apply some of that to my cheeks
because I mean okay maybe I like this
one just a little bit more I just I've
used the Physicians Formula one for
years so it holds a really really big
place in my heart I just I love this
highlight okay so now I can move on to
the eyes okay so the next category is
write or die I shadow palette it is the
Too Faced chocolate bar palette this is
the palette that I've used the most I
actually had to repurchase another one
this is a decently new one because my
old one it was like used to the bone
obviously this isn't a palette I pick up
when I want a super bold colorful smokey
eye or anything like that but on a day
to day basis I feel like this is enough
for me so I'm not gonna do like a whole
full-on crazy eye look with this because
I'm actually on my way not right now but
I'm when I'm done filming this I have to
go to a baseball game so I'm gonna do a
very natural eye look I'm gonna go in
with salted caramel I love this
transition shade fun fact my love for
the shade salted caramel is what
inspired me to create the eye shadow
Cornelius from my where the light is
quad the shade Cornelius it's not the
same but salted caramel definitely
inspired that color
this is a NARS crease brush probably too
pricey I'm also going to take salted
caramel on my lower lash line I'm going
to take hot chocolate and I'm going to
work that on the outer corners
I'm going to take a triple fudge and I'm
going to kind of use this as an eyeliner
I'm going to smudge it really really
close to my lashes I'm using this like
wet and wild flat shader brush I'm going
to take semi-sweet right here and run
that on my lower lashes and then I'm
going to take triple fudge one more time
and just focus this on the outer parts
of my lower lash line
to highlight underneath my bra and I'm
going to take white chocolate and then
I'm going to take champagne truffle to
highlight my inner corners
okay so four eyeliners I know I spoke
about specific liquid liners and gel
liners and all that in my other videos
but for this video I want to
specifically talk about tencel eyeliners
because I use these way more than any
other type of eyeliner like regular
pencil eyeliners on my red eye eyeliners
and for black I don't think any other
eyeliner compares to the NYX gel pencil
liner in pitch black this is there twice
Julie eyeliner I love these I also love
the brown one I wish they came out with
more colors because I love the formula
of these they stay on my waterline all
days I have NARS black eyeliners make up
forever black eyeliners so many black
eyeliners and the next one is hands-down
the best and my favorite and when it
comes to colorful eyeliners I love the
color pop creme gel liners they make the
best colorful eyeliners in my opinion
this one is mr. Bing which is my
favorite Brown eyeliner of all time
shameless plug I know but I love this
eyeliner the color pop eyeliners last
forever on my waterline as well and I
just feel like they're way better than
high-end eyeliners in my opinion next up
is mascara this is my all-time favorite
mascara
akiko extra sculpt Volume Mascara hands
down the best mascara I have ever used
it gives me so much volume but it gives
me a lot of length as well and this is
the kind of mascara that I can go over
and over and over and it doesn't get too
clumpy like it can get pretty clumpy but
it's not too much and I love it way more
than other high-end mascaras I've tried
in the past now I know I don't really
wear falsies that much on my tutorials I
wear them every once in a while my
all-time favorite lashes have to be the
Christina lashes I get these on Amazon
they're super affordable and these are
the wispy lashes really similar to red
cherry I'm pretty sure they're like made
by the same people I don't know but I
just get the christina ones they just
look so wispy and long and beautiful
love these my favorite eyelash glue of
all time is the Eschete o companion
eyelash glue I love that you can brush
it on this one keeps my falsies on all
night love this eyelash glue I also
really really love the house of lashes
glue as well okay so we are almost done
now
talk about lips my favorite lipstick I'm
not just saying this I promise I'm not
just saying this but my favorite
lipstick of all time is Aquarius by
colour-pop this is the one that lives in
my Beauty room I have another one that
lives in my purse it's the lipstick I
wear the most I'm so sorry for the next
colors like all lip categories my
favorites are nudes I'm so sorry I love
a bold lip but I wear nudes more often
so it makes sense that nudes are my
ride-or-die Aquarius is just my favorite
lipstick and it's $5 so affordable and
it just looks so pretty it's nice and
creamy it has kind of like a glossy
finish but not too glossy my favorite
liquid lipstick of all time this one's
really tough because okay Oprah makes
the best liquid lipsticks on the market
in my opinion they are the ultimate
liquid lipstick they don't dry out your
lips but they last all day they transfer
a bit but they're so creamy
Miami fever and Havana nights are
obviously my favorite from Oprah but I
love Sal Paulo so much I wear Sal Paulo
so often but I cannot find Sal Paulo
anywhere literally anywhere like I don't
know where I'd I don't know what I'd do
with it
for Glaus my favorite glass of all time
is the buxom full-on lip cream in the
shade White Russian this formula in
general is my favorite I have so many of
these buxom lip glosses it's sticky
enough to wear it lasts a long time on
the lips but it's not too sticky to wear
it's annoying the formula is just on
point and when you put it on it has a
minty like feeling it's very cooling lip
gloss it feels like cold when you put it
on I know if this claims to be a
plumping lip gloss but it doesn't plump
my lips at all it doesn't burn or
anything it's just like a nice minty
coolness and white Russian is my
favorite because it just goes over any
nude lipstick perfectly
okay and then the last category is
setting sprays my favorite setting spray
is the skin Danai via makeup finishing
spray in Bridal I don't know the
difference between Bridal and the other
one but this is just the one that I go
to the most oh i sprayed like all of
that into this great
it makes my makeup last all night as
opposed to any other setting spray I own
seriously I love love love skin the Navy
a settings brace okay guys so that
