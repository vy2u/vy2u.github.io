video I was gonna film in front of my
desk but there was like 30 boxes on my
desk and it looked ridiculously ugly so
I had to film with a backdrop except all
my back drops were in Danny's truck when
I was filming this video and Danny was
not home so here you go
ladies and gentlemen I bring you a
really really really unprofessional
video with a black um bedsheet with
little clips on the sides alright enjoy
the show hey guys so today's video is
going to be a makeup tutorial on the
look I'm wearing right now I'm extremely
fallish I know it's winter but I'm I
can't get away from these mustard colors
I know this is actually my favorite
color to wear like I could wear this
color every day of my life it's my
favorite it's also my favorite like kind
of eyeshadows oh my god anyway so
today's video is a makeup tutorial like
I just said and it's mainly using the
Too Faced chocolate bomb bomb really I
love this palette it's so so good I
don't think I love it as much as my
original chocolate bar but it's close
like I love it and you guys know I
wasn't a big fan of the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette I don't own it I
didn't like it I bought it I returned it
but this one I really love and this look
may be a little bit bold for some of you
but you could totally tone it down
totally tone it down with a nude lip I
just wanted to show you guys a tutorial
using my lippy stick and tarus cuz it's
been so highly requested to do a
tutorial with this lip color so yeah
that is what I did and I really hope you
guys enjoy it I know it's similar like
with the rosy colors to looks I've done
in the past but like I said a tutorial
using this lipstick was really requested
and I just love how rolls gold pairs
with these Brown lips so yes if you want
to see how to get this look then just
keep on watching so I'm going to start
this video by priming my lids I'm using
the Milani eyeshadow primer I really
love this primer and it's so affordable
I'm going to take my Too Faced chocolate
bonbon palette and I'm going into the
shade divinity and
just using this to set that primer down
now I'm going to go into almond truffle
and I'm going to use this as my
transition shade I'm taking a sephora
crease brush and I'm just uh f---ing
this into my crease so that all the
eyeshadows blend really nicely on top
I'm going to take the color pop
eyeshadow in weanie and I'm applying
this to my entire lid with my fingers
now I'm going to take a small little
crease brush distance four more feet and
I'm just buffing out that eyeshadow I'm
going into almond truffle and I'm using
that same brush to further blend the
eyeshadow just so it looks like the
weenie shade blends seamlessly into the
other colors okay back into the palette
I'm using cashew chew and I'm taking a
fluffy brush and I'm further blending
lots of blending in this video okay I'm
going to go into the shade satin sheets
this is an Oprah 11 brush and I'm just
applying that to the inner half of my
eye and in my tear duct as well and then
I just went over that weenie color to
intensify it a little bit mole all right
back into the shade divinity I'm using
this to highlight underneath my brow
bone now I'm going to take this
beautiful color this might be my
favorite shade in the palette it's
called a Bordeaux and I'm using this
kind of like a soft eyeliner on the top
of my eyes really close to my lashes
okay so I'm going to move on to my face
before I finish my eyes I'm priming my
face with anivia hydration essence
primer I'm still testing it out I don't
know how I feel about it I definitely
like the post shave balm a lot more so
for my foundation I'm mixing two
together the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless and the Becca luminous
foundation so for concealer I'm using my
Maybelline and better skin concealer and
I am just applying this to my eyes
you've seen me do this about a trillion
times you know underneath my eyes and
between my eyebrows on my nose on my
chin I'm just highlighting the those
parts of my face while covering my dark
circles as well
okay so it's a set that I'm using my
trusty RC ma no color powder and I'm
setting my under eye concealer and every
or else where I applied concealer all
right back to the eyes I'm going to take
a pencil brush and I'm going to dip it
into that Bordeaux shade and I am just
buffing this on my lower lashes and then
I'm taking satin sheets and highlighting
that inner part of my eye for mascara
I'm using a Mike Eagle extra sculpt
Volume Mascara and then for my bottom
lashes this is brand new I just bought
this it's the max extended play
gigablack lash I hear a lot of people
raving about it for the lower lashes and
I really really loved it this was the
first time I used it and I really like
how it made my lower lashes look a blast
and then I just popped on some falsies
these are the christina wisps falsies I
got mine on Amazon so to finish off my
face I'm going to contour using the Wet
n Wild contour palette in dulce de leche
and I'm using an elf contouring brush
this brush is amazing for a really
precise chiseled out contour it's really
fabulous I love it so much and then I'm
gonna take the lighter shade in this
little contour duo and I'm gonna put it
underneath my eyes just to highlight a
little bit okay so for blush I'm using
my malli effortless airbrush duo and I'm
taking this peach blush and I'm popping
that on the apples of my cheeks this is
a Sonia Kashuk a blush brush and I
really like it then I'm gonna highlight
my face this is a up and up brush from
Target really really inexpensive and a
really great brush I'm highlighting my
face just a tiny bit with that highlight
I wanted to warm up my face a little bit
more so I took this Milani baked bronzer
and I'm just warming up the skin just a
touch more
so to finish off the look I am applying
my lip color I'm taking the colour-pop
lippie pencil in the shade tauros tauros
tauros tauros and then I'm filling in my
lips with it and then I'm going in with
the lippy stick in Taurus right on top
so that completes this lick I really
hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much
