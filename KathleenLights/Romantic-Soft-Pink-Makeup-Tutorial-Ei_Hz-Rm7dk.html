tutorial on this look I was so surprised
at how many people wanted a tutorial on
this look I was wearing this in my
empties video and there were a ton of
comments telling me that I needed to sit
down and film this video so I did I
didn't think I was going to because the
look is literally so easy it's like
easiest look ever but I love this look I
think it's so romantic and pretty kind
of like ethereal and like a soft pink
yeah this is actually a talk through
makeup tutorial and if you want to see
how to get this look on my face then
just keep watching so I'm going to start
off with my face since the eyes are so
simple I don't really get a lot of fall
out with this look I'm going in with the
NYX born to glow illuminating primer and
I'm just using this on my skin to help
it look nice and glowy this stuff is so
similar to the Mac strobe cream and it's
way way way more affordable the
foundation I'm going to be using today
is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation it's the same foundation I
was wearing in my empties video I have a
love-hate relationship with this
foundation sometimes I like it sometimes
I hate it I like it for the most part by
the way I'm using the shade porcelain I
like it for the most part but it can
look pretty cakey around my nose
sometimes it just looks heavy on my skin
I don't know why but I like it it's just
I don't know I'm using a sponge from the
brand mascara it's really really similar
to the Beauty Blender and it's more
affordable the concealer I'm going to be
using today is the Tarte shape tape
concealer I can't seem to use any other
concealer I mean I do don't everyone I
have other concealers I love but these
are just my favorite right now and it's
making me want to go on another synapse
at declutter I kind of stopped that
series because there was nothing else I
really wanted to declutter but after
discovering this amazing concealer I
want to kind of get rid of some of them
because I don't really use them so I'm
just adding a little bit on
inner corners right here to then blend
it out I mixed the shades light/medium
and fair and I'm just going to blend
that out you really do not need a lot of
this concealer I know when it comes to
YouTube videos like you'll see youtubers
just like paint on the concealer like I
do I always like paint on my concealer
but for this one specifically I feel
like you don't need to do that because a
little go such a long way so yeah I'm
thinking of doing that I really really
really want to give away or get rid of a
couple of my concealers because this one
is just so amazing just a couple just a
couple just get rid of a couple I'm
going to take a little bit of the shade
fair and apply it to areas I kind of
want to highlight a little bit I'm going
to go in with another cream product and
then I'll set my under eye concealer and
all that so I'm going to take my cover
FX custom enhancer drops in the shade
sunkissed this is the bronze II shade
the light one I have been using this as
bronzer I love it so much so I just take
some in the back of my hand
after I shake it a bit and with that
same sponge I use for foundation and
concealer I'm just going to apply some
to my face
I think this might be the best liquid
bronzer I have ever come across in my
life it just blends so well into the
skin I'm gonna apply some more for the
other side of my face Selene learned how
to open my door now
looks like I'm gonna have to change the
doorknobs no privacy with that one I'll
close my door and I'll ask her to stay
outside because I'm filming and she just
opens it she's like yeah no I'm coming
in I'm going to add some to my doll line
here okay so now I'm going to go ahead
and set my under eye concealer and set
areas of my face where I feel like it
needs to be set I'm going to take my RMS
Beauty on powder just kind of like a
translucent HD powder and with this
Sephora Pro contour number 79 brush I'm
just going to set everything
so after powdering my face looks a
little bit more matte than I wanted to
so what I did was I went in with this
shimmery bronzer it's so dark like this
is way too dark for my skin tone so I
have to make sure I use a super super
light hand this is an elf mineral
bronzer in the shade beech bronze I'm
going to take this pressure here I
bought it at Ulta this is the it
cosmetics for Ulta line exclusively at
Ulta and this is their airbrush powder
brush so I'm going to take a little bit
and then I'm going to really tap this
off
okay so I'm going to go ahead and do the
eye makeup because I really feel like I
need to do my eyes already okay so I
lied apparently there is fallout with
this look because of the glitter I
completely forgot about that for some
reason so I would suggest doing your
eyes first before your face makeup I'm
going to take my surprise rinds on a
salty on water run as long as paneling
I'm going to take this shade right here
called buon fresco and I'm going to buff
this into my crease using a morphe m4
for one brush I'm adding just a little
bit of this color to my crease because I
will go back in to intensify it in a
little bit I'm going to take Tim pearl
which is this lightest shade at the
front and I'm going to use that to
highlight underneath my rubble and then
I'm going to go in with this shining
star right here this is the butter
LONDON a butter LONDON something it
doesn't say I hate when companies do
that what is the name of this thing it's
like a cream eyeshadow but it's not like
a cream in my opinion it has a similar
consistency to hair gel
like really thick sculpting hair gel
that is the consistency of this but
they're just like little potted
eyeshadows in jelly form this specific
color is in the shade frosted and it's
my favorite one they sent me like four
shades this is so stunning my favorite
way to apply this is with my finger so
I'm just gonna dip my finger in this and
I like to build up the coverage so I'll
go in a couple times but I'll just start
to apply this to my eye
I'm not trying to flick you off I
promise I know it's my middle finger but
it's not my intention and apply some
more the really good thing about this
eyeshadow is that it builds really well
it doesn't get sticky and they last a
long time on my eye I'm going to go back
into the Anasazi palette and I'm going
to take Blom Festo again I can't say
that word normal and with that same
crease brush I used earlier I'm going to
add a little bit more of this eyeshadow
now I'll just go in with a little bit
more of that frosted shade from my inner
corners I'm going to mix these two
shades together premier and Primavera
first I'm going to go in with Vermeer
and then I'm going to top it off with
Primavera
for my lower lashline I'm doing
something extremely simple I'm going to
go in with buon fresco on a little
pencil brush this is a tiny little
Ecotools shadow smudger brush I'm going
to run that on my lower lash line and
then over top of that I'm going to take
burnt orange I'm going to curl my lashes
you can go ahead and wear falsies within
my empties video I wasn't wearing any
falsies so I'm just going to coat my top
and bottom lashes with my benefit roller
lash so that completes the eye is really
simple and we're pretty much almost done
when I filmed my empties video I wasn't
wearing any blush I just went in with my
highlight and I used my makeup geek
highlighting palette and I first went in
with the pink shade this is called
starlight I'm going to try out this
brush this is the morphe r-36 I'm going
to dip it into that starlight shade you
definitely want to tap off the excess
when you're using these highlights
because they're extremely pigmented and
then I'm going to go over top with the
shade night light which is the lightest
gold shade
I'm going to mix the shade night light
and star light and highlight the nose a
little bit and I'm going to take just
star light and highlight my Cupid's bow
for lips I was wearing a very very very
nude lip almost concealer like but I
think it ties in with like the light
pink ethereal look I'm going in with the
buxom true nude lip foundation in the
shade buff this is the lightest shade
it's so light the trick with this
specific color is you cannot apply too
much I find that when I do that I get
that disgusting white thing on the
inside of my mouth you don't I'm talking
about so I actually have to tap this on
my mouth and then I just blend that in
and then I went over it with the
colour-pop ultra glossy lip in the shade
fairy floss this is my favorite shade
out of all of the new color pop glosses
it's just like a very very light nude
but it's not too pigmented it's a sheer
formula I love it I find that gloss is
this color that are too pigmented give
you that weird thing you think I was
talking about
okay guys so that completes this look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I love
looks like this with like a super nude
lip and everything kind of like
monochromatic I hope you guys enjoyed

swallowed that
and with that same crease krrish you
definitely want to tap tap F no I'm
