tutorial on this look I'm wearing I'm
sorry that this is a voiceover intro but
I lost the footage of my intro so I has
to do a voiceover but I've gotten a lot
of requests from you guys over the past
few days telling me to do a Valentine's
Day makeup tutorial using at my dream
Street palette so that is what I'm doing
for you guys today
another dream Street tutorial this is a
rose bold smoky eye perfect for a
Valentine's Day and for today's tutorial
I'm mainly focusing on the eye makeup so
I already have my foundation my
concealer and my powder on in this video
but I do show you everything else but
let's just go ahead and jump into it I'm
gonna take my dream Street palette and
the first eyeshadow I'm using is magical
I'm gonna use this color as my crease
shade I'm using this on a big fluffy
brush and I'm pretty much just putting
this eyeshadow all over my eyeball
apparently I'm really just I want this
color to be everywhere basically so I'm
just blending that in going in little by
little and adding more color and then
I'm gonna take shooting star and on a
smaller brush still a big fluffy brush
but not as fat I am applying this a
little bit more precisely in the crease
not taking it as high up as I took
magical you know what I'm saying oh I
took some powder and I applied this
underneath the eyes because I did apply
my foundation already so I wanted the
fallout to fall on the powder and not on
my foundation but I took the shade
twinkle and this is the star of the show
I'm just applying this all over my lid
with my finger and then I went into
elfish and I'm just applying this to the
outer corners and dragging this color
into my crease I'm gonna start building
this color up little by little as I go
on in the tutorial because I want it to
be pretty dark in my crease so I do go
back into this eye shadow a couple of
times
during this tutorial I also don't want
things to look too harsh in the crease
so I go back in with shooting star and
I'm just blending out elfish I don't
want it to have any harsh lines I don't
want it to look like you know too
intense so I'm just constantly blending
out the harsh edges and then I took some
more of Magical to give it that peachy
look in the crease I really love how the
peach just makes the crease pop so I'm
just
a little bit more of that and then to
highlight my browbone i'm going in with
Moony of coats i'm gonna wet my brush
and i'm gonna take a little bit more of
twinkle even though you don't need to
wet this eyeshadow it just looks so
intense when you do so I'm applying just
a little bit more on my lid and then I
went back into elfish and I did the
exact same thing just applying this to
the outer corners and dragging that into
the crease and just blending blending
blending I'm gonna go back in to magical
and you guessed it as add some more to
the crease and blending some more and
then I just repeat this step a couple of
times
for my lower lashline I'm just gonna
take the same shades I used in my crease
in the exact same order a little bit of
magical a little bit of shooting star
and a little bit of elfish I'm just not
gonna drag elfish all the way across my
lower lashline I'm just focusing this on
the outer corners on my lower lash line
just to mimic the top lid and then I
went in with a deep brown eyeliner this
is the Makeup Forever aqua XL I pencil I
wanted like a deep chocolate color and I
love these eyeliners they're awesome
they last all day and then for mascara I
went in with the Lancome monkey a big
mascara and it's an awesome mascara it
makes your lashes look incredible but I
wanted something a little bit extra but
I didn't want to go in with falsies so I
went in with the kiss individual lashes
and I just applied some of these on the
outer corners
well not like only the outer corners but
I didn't drag it all the way and then to
finish up at the face I went in with the
Wet n Wild mega Glo contouring palette
and this is in the shade due to the
leche I just used the contour side to
contour my cheeks a little bit but to
bronze up the skin I went in with these
you a suntan bronzer I love this bronzer
and I'm just applying this all over my
face to give me a nice bronze look I'm
gonna mix two blushes together but I'm
gonna go in it with the Burt's Bees
toasted cinnamon blush first I love this
blush I can't get enough of it but I
wanted something a little bit pinkier a
little bit rosier to put on top so I
went in with the essence silky touch
blush in the shade babydoll and this
added the nice little pinky touch
perfect for Valentine's Day I'm aware I
went a little bit overboard with the
blush but you know sometimes that
happens for highlight I went in with the
unreason highlight with a Nastasia it
actually launches today when you're
watching this it launches on Valentine's
Day and it's amazing it's beautiful so I
just popped that a little bit of place
and then I went in with the Ben Nye
final seal matte makeup sealer and wow I
don't like this I mean obviously what
was I expecting it's a matte makeup
sealer but I just wanted to test it out
and supposedly it's great to make your
makeup last all day so that's awesome
for you Orly gals out there for my lip
combo I first lined my lips with the
Catrice lip foundation this is like the
lightest one they have I forget the name
it's not on the actual lip liner and
then I went over it with the colour-pop
Lux lipstick in boy because I wanted it
just a little bit lighter and this is
like the perfect mixing lipstick and
then I wanted a glossy finish so I went
over it with the anastacio lip gloss in
the shade undressed which is like a
super nude nude but it looks so pretty
and juicy but yeah guys that completes
this video I hope you guys enjoyed thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next
