tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
here it is using my new color pop collab
I came out with a new quad and then two
new lipsticks two of these and for those
of you who don't follow me on Instagram
or Twitter you guys are like what
because I have not discussed this on my
channel yet but I will have an entire
video dedicated to this tomorrow because
tomorrow is the launch date this is not
available today it's not available yet
but it will go for sale tomorrow so I'm
gonna have a whole video dedicated to my
new quad and my new lipsticks swatches
and everything but I wanted to film a
quick tutorial using my new quad this
new little collection is called where
the night is and I am so so happy with
it I hope you guys really like the
colors I wanted to do something a little
bit more bold so for today I am using
two of the shades in the quad I'm using
this one right here called Porter yes I
named it after my dog this one is called
Porter and then the really pretty pop of
rose gold on the lid is this one right
here and this called weenie which weenie
is what I call saline I really really
love how this turned out I'm also using
the lippy stick and Aquarius which is
one of the lipsticks I created so if you
want to see how to get this makeup
tutorial it's like a rose gold halo with
a little bit of warmth I really hope you
enjoyed if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching so as
always I'm priming my eyes with Mac's
prep and prime 24 hour extended eye base
this primer is amazing with color pop
shadows because it really helps them
stick to your lids I love this primer
and then I'm going to take translucent
powder and just dust that over my lid so
that everything blends smoothly so I'm
going to take makeup geek eyeshadow in
the shade creme Brule and this is a
Sephora Pro blending crease brush and
I'm just dusting this into my crease as
my transition shade then I'm going to
take Mirage also by makeup geek and I'm
going to use this as my brow bone
highlight
it's kind of like a mix between a mat
and a sheen it's a really pretty eye
shadow now I'm going to take Porter from
the quad and I love this eye shadow look
at this border I love it so much and I'm
going to start by applying this with my
finger and I'm just putting this on my
entire lid and then I decided to switch
over to a synthetic brush synthetic
brushes work best with color pop
eyeshadows as opposed to like natural
hair brushes so I'm just applying this
all over my lid bringing it up to the
crease and making sure that everything
is nice and blended and then I'm just
going to go back into the eye shadow and
making it more pigmented on the lid and
then I got out of the frame you know as
usual so I'm going to take makeup geeks
eyeshadow in the shade cocoa bear and
this is another brush pipe here it looks
like a Mac 217 only it's like a
synthetic version which is perfect to
blend out to color pop eyeshadows and
I'm just applying cocoa butter into my
crease and blending it all out now I'm
going to take weeny my favorite shade
and with my finger I'm gonna apply this
to the center of my eyeball kind of like
where my pupil is if you know what I'm
saying so I'm just applying that to my
lid and then blending it out with like
my own finger and then I'm going to go
back into the shade Porter and I'm going
to apply this to the outer corners and
the inner corner I'm trying to create
like a halo eye effect I only want weeny
to stand out like right in the center of
the lid so I'm going to move on to my
face before I finish up my eyes I'm
going to prime my face with the Nivea
postmen shave balm and I'm going to
apply that to my entire face and then
I'm going to take my makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation in the shade 140 and
I'm just gonna like skim through this
because you've seen me put on my
foundation about 6 trillion times so I'm
just applying that with a flat top
kabuki by morphe and just you know
blending benen as usual as usual now I'm
going to take my bare minerals concealer
I think this is called like the serum
concealer not exactly sure I will have
the name
down below and I'm just applying this
underneath my eyes and other plates
plates no other places of my face to
highlight and then I'm blending that all
in with my Sedona lace 217 brush and to
set all that because as you can see that
concealer leaves your face like kind of
dewy so I'm going to take my cosmetics
bye-bye pores pressed powder and I'm
going to apply that underneath my eyes
just to set the concealer to help it
from not creasing and to take away like
that ultra doux eNOS and then I'm just
going to apply this everywhere else I
put that concealer okay so let's finish
the eyes I'm going to take Porter again
on a pencil brush this is a pencil brush
from morphe and it's a synthetic pencil
brush which is perfect you know like
I've been saying so I'm applying that to
my lower lash line from the outer corner
all the way into the inner corner and
then I'm going to apply a black eyeliner
this is from NYX it's their gel black
eyeliner and I'm going to tightline with
this and apply this to my waterline as
well and then I'm also going to take
that same black eyeliner and apply it
really really close to my top lashes
kind of like if I'm making an eyeliner
but I'm not I just want some definition
just not too much and then I'm going to
take my pencil brush and blend that all
out so there are no harsh lines
now I'm going to take makeup geeks Coco
bear and I'm going to blend out my lower
lash line with that a little bit just so
that it looks exactly like the top part
of my eye I'm going to go back into
weeny with a pencil brush and I'm going
to apply this directly under where we
need is on the top lid and then I'm
going to go ahead and apply some mascara
this is the L'Oreal telescopic carbon
black and then to highlight my inner
corners I am using the Kiko eyeshadow in
the shade 208 which is Mac whisper of
guilt
it's a dupe totally the same thing so to
finish off my face I'm going to take the
Too Faced cocoa contour kit and I'm
going to take light cocoa and apply this
underneath my eyes just to kind of
brighten up under there a little bit
then I'm going to take medium cocoa and
this is the perfect undertone for
contouring and I'm going to contour my
face this is a Sephora brush like when
they collab with Haku photo it's a
synthetic like tulip style brush I
really like it I bought it at Sephora
that's nice so I'm just contouring my
face with this you guys know that I
don't like a super super harsh contour
that's just me you can go ham if you
want to the world is your oyster I'm
just gonna do a nice soft compound
cocktail and now I'm going to take this
nude spectrum blush palette by zoeva and
I'm going to take this pinky nude shade
and I'm going to apply this to my cheeks
to my cheeks I was going to say it
Chingam but now my cheeks this is an elf
face powder brush and I'm just applying
a light light layer to my face then to
highlight my brow bone I'm going to take
that same Kiko 208 water eyeshadow and
apply this to my cheek bone but I wanted
something a little bit more so I took
this laura geller do o it has french
vanilla and Portofino
those are both highlights and I just mix
them both together and I applied it to
my brow my brow bone what's wrong with
me to my cheek bones the tops of my
cheekbones and then I applied it to my
inner corners as well just so that
everything can you know be matchy-matchy
for my lips I'm taking the Libbie pencil
I created with color pop in the shade
Aquarius and I'm applying this to my
entire lips and filling them in as well
and then I'm going to take the Aquarius
lip stick and apply it right on top it's
a cream finish so it has a nice like
glossy finish I love it at when I was
smelling it because it smells so good I
don't know what's different about these
but they smell ten times better than the
regular lipsticks but anyway that
completes this makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoyed please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
