a make a tutorial on this really fun
vampy look I love how this warm rose
gold pairs with a really dark purple lip
and they get so fun and wintery today's
video is special because it is sponsored
by NARS I'm gonna be sharing the NARS
unfiltered cheek palettes with you guys
I'm using them in today's video this is
unfiltered one and then this one is
unfiltered too unfiltered two is
actually my personal favorite these
palettes are awesome they come with a
ton of different blushes bronzers
highlights whatever you want to use
these for they have matte and shimmer
shades
I like unfiltered too because it's more
suitable for my skin tone unfiltered one
is really beautiful though I mean it's
perfect for those of you with maybe
medium to deeper skin tones and filtered
to actually has my favorite NARS
highlight of all time which is hot sand
this one right here I love this
highlight so when I found out it was
gonna be in this palette I got so
excited it's I love it they really are
fun palettes unfiltered one is a little
bit more warm and unfiltered too has
more cooler shades this blush in the
shade Exhibit A I wish I could wear this
on my cheeks this would be an amazing
eyeshadow for me but if you have deep
skin this must look stunning on the
cheeks you can create so many different
looks with this you don't have to use
them on your face only I mean I used two
of these shades as eyeshadow today
they're really fun and they have really
fun packaging too but anyway I really
love how this tutorial came out and if
you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyelids
and I'm going in with this eye shadow
from morphe it is the ES 89 and I'm
taking this color into my crease and I'm
really going to focus this color in my
crease because I'm only really using a
few eyeshadows so I want to make sure
that this color is nice and diffused and
very pigmented in my crease and then I'm
going to go in with this color pop
single eyeshadow in the shade la la it's
a really pretty rose gold and I'm gonna
pop this on my entire lid
I'm then going to take that same morphe
eyeshadow we used earlier and I'm going
to use this to blend out that Lally
shade just so that there are no harsh
lines or harsh edges and everything is
nice and blended I'm gonna take this
single eyeshadow by NARS this one is
called Galapagos and I'm going to kind
of use this as an eyeliner I've done
this in my videos in the past but I'm
just gonna focus this really close to my
lashes and create a soft faded eyeliner
look just so that it looks a little bit
deep closer to the lashes makes it look
a little bit more smoky I really love
doing this I'm then gonna take that same
Galapagos eyeshadow and I'm just going
to pack some of this on the outer
corners just let it looks a little bit
deeper on the outer corners and a little
bit more smoky I'm also taking my time
with applying this eye shadow because it
is a dark brown so I don't want to apply
too much too quickly but I just go back
and forth applying a little bit at a
time and then I went back in and blended
out the eyeshadow some more with my
brush okay so I'm going to move onto the
face before I finish up my eyes I'm
going to take my glossy a priming
moisturizer and I'm going to prime my
skin with this and then the foundation
I'm using is the la girl pro coverage
illuminating foundation and I'm going to
apply this to my entire face
or concealer I'm using my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade vanilla
and I'm going to apply this underneath
my eyes to hide my dark circles but to
also highlight my face I'm also applying
this on my nose in between my eyebrows
on my chin just so that everything is
nice and even and highlighted
to set my concealer I'm going to take my
RC ma no color powder and I'm going to
apply this everywhere I applied some
concealer but I'm also going to set the
rest of my face with this powder because
this foundation is a little bit too
tacky for me so I always make sure that
I set it so I'm not only setting my
concealer but I'm also setting my
foundation okay to finish up the eyes
I'm going to take this jouer eyeliner in
the shade matte plum and I'm going to
apply this to my waterline I'm going to
apply a lot of this because I will blend
it out with a pencil brush
I want the purple to show up a lot so I
just took my pencil brush and smudged
out the eyeliner just to make it a
little bit more smoky and not so perfect
I like it to look a little bit more
smudged I'm going to go into the NARS
unfiltered one pallet and I'm going to
take this mauve shade called
out there and I'm gonna use this to
blend out the purple eyeliner I just put
down to make it look a little bit more
Mavi and bring out the purple tones in
the eyeliner and then I'm going to go
back into the NARS galapagos eyeshadow
and just focus this on the very outer
corners of my eyes just like the top lid
I'm pretty much mimicking what I did on
the top for mascara I just applied a ton
a ton of mascara I use the maybelline
plumped up colossal volume and then to
highlight my brow bone I took that same
NARS unfiltered one palette and I took
the shade watch me and I used that to
highlight underneath my brow bone and
then I went into the unfiltered 2
palette and I took the hot sands
highlighter and I applied this to my
inner corners to highlight and then to
finish up my face I'm going to go in
with bronzer I'm going to take the NARS
Laguna bronzer and I'm going to use this
to bronze but also contour my face a
little bit
for blush I'm mixing two colors I'm
going to take the shade take over from
the unfiltered one palette and I'm going
to take this peachy shade from the
unfiltered 2 palette this one is called
Fame and I'm just mixing them both
together and popping them on my cheeks
to create a peachy bronze blush and then
for highlight I'm going to take my
favorite the NARS Hots and highlight and
I'm going to pop this on the tops of my
cheekbones and on my nose just to
highlight I love the shade I apply a lot
of it but I really like it and then to
finish off the look I'm applying my lip
color this is the color pop ultra satin
lip in the shade hutch and that
completes this video thank you guys so
