a Sephora huh I recently was on this
four website made a few purchases I am
addicted to the just arrived section at
Sephora I know I've mentioned that a
hundred times but it's like I love it
there and I got a lot of questions like
why do you buy so much makeup if you get
sent so much makeup and I don't like to
talk about products that I only get sent
from PR because there are ton of other
brands that don't send PR and I don't
want my channel should just be PR stuff
I want to buy things on my own I want to
try out products talk about different
brands so that is why I just continued
to buy makeup I've used the majority of
these products so that I can kind of
give you many reviews but there are a
couple things I haven't tried yet but I
still wanted to mention anyway because I
want you guys to let me know if they're
any good and I just realized my nails
are pretty bare but I have like nail
polish chipping on a bunch of them and I
hate chippy dales so ignore that so my
box broke on this but I recently
purchased this I've never heard of this
brand before I don't know if it's new or
not but it's called perfect and this is
their skin perfection broad-spectrum SPF
30 this is kind of like a tinted
moisturizer this one is in the shade
radiant which is a little bit too dark
for my skin tone not gonna lie a lot of
bed too dark but I'm wearing it today
and I made it work I blended it in
really well but I was interested in
buying this because in the summer time
I'm like obsessed with tinted
moisturizers you know SPF with just a
little bit of coverage I like that look
in the summer it has vitamin C and E
hyaluronic microspheres peptides omega-6
and coconut oil paraben free for all
skin types TSA approved and I love that
this is a physical sunscreen it is very
very mu C I'm not really used to my
tinted moisturizers feeling like this
because even my it cosmetics one it's
not as mu C this is like mousse in a
tube and at first it threw me off but it
blends in really really well this has
very light coverage but it just gives
your skin a nice even tone also from the
brand perfect this is their liquid gold
illuminating Perfector for body face and
hair it has green
verbena verbena and avocado oil lifts
treat gloss detox protects smooth
hydrate energize condition and
illuminate I am using this right now on
my body I don't know if you can tell can
you tell right here on the shoulder
maybe not as a body illuminator is
really the only way I've used this I
don't know how I would use this in my
hair like I don't know have you guys
tried this in your hair let me know
because I find that to be a little
strange and I also think it might be a
little bit too creamy for a face
highlight and it isn't as intense as I
would like a face highlight to be so for
now I'm pretty much only using it on my
body it gives you a nice moisturize
feeling and it gives your skin a slight
very slight golden glow I got two
products from the brand origins I love
this brand for skincare and these are
part of their ginseng line which I
actually don't love I know a lot of
people swear by this line but I don't
really use anything from this line so
this is the ginseng energy boosting
treatment lotion mist it has like a
bunch of stuff in it it has water citrus
lemon peel oil grapefruit peel oil
spearmint leaf oil and a ton of other
stuff I have actually been using this
kind of as a face primer like right
before I put on my actual face primer
because this really does hydrate my skin
and I love the scent I love anything
that smells like oranges or anything
citrusy and it makes my face feel extra
moisturize like I definitely understand
there lotion mist because it does feel
like a lotion mist but yeah I've only
used it a couple times but liking it so
far I'm addicted to sprays like anything
in a spray bottle that I could spare
anybody I want to buy I don't know I
know that's weird but I do I like sprays
and then I got the ginseng peel-off mask
to refine and refresh I got this because
I was interested in the whole peel-off
aspect of this mask it has coffee beans
in this and a ton of other things it's
supposed to minimize pores but also give
your skin like a nice radiant like
refreshed look I haven't tried this yet
but it has the coolest color it's a
golden pink duochrome
which is why I bought it I know that
sounds ridiculous but look at this look
at this this
looks like fireball eyeshadow from Urban
Decay like seriously is it a shadow or
like highlight I don't know it has the
coolest colors to it which is a stupid
reason to buy a skincare product okay so
let's talk about something I don't
really like all that much this is the
Laura Mercier eye art caviar color
inspired edition I bought this because I
thought the colors were stunning look at
these really pretty like soft everyday
colors doesn't look like much but I was
really intrigued by these like pinky
Browns the shimmery colors are not very
pigmented like look at this color like
there's barely any payoff but that being
said I love the mattes in this palette I
think the mattes blend really really
well
I love the tones and the matte colors
they're really nice but for the price I
don't think it's worth it because I
don't love the shimmer shades and half
of these are shimmer I bought another
Too Faced Born This Way concealer
because they accidentally sent me to
fairs and they didn't send me a light
shade so I bought this shade light
because this is perfect for me and when
I am more on the tan side like this is
perfect for underneath my eyes and I
love this concealer if I want a nice
natural finish something that doesn't
have too much coverage like at a
day-to-day basis but after discovering
the Tarte shape tape concealer like I
don't want to wear any other concealer
and it's crazy because I raved about
this in my last month's favorite they
born this way and the Born This Way is
still really good but holy crap I don't
think I've ever used a concealer I like
more than this I know that's a huge
statement but I think this has become my
favorite concealer of all time more than
the Urban Decay Naked skin even more
than my NARS radiant creamy concealer
which is my favorite concealer ever like
favorite I think I like this more I know
that that seems crazy but it's true
loving that concealer so much but I
didn't want to pick up a shade light in
the Born This Way because I still really
do love this
anyway I purchased this I got a huge PR
package from Urban Decay in the mail
with their new mundos palette and
their new eyeliners and three of their
all-nighter foundations this by the way
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
liquid foundation it's brand new but the
colors they sent me were too pink like
they sent me all pink shades so I went
on the Urban Decay website and bought
the shade 3.0 because they are not
selling this at Sephora yet I had to buy
on the Urban Decay website and I'm in
the shade 3.0 in the naked skin so I
figured I would be 3.0 in this one I've
heard really amazing things about this
I'm a little nervous to try this because
I hear that it's super matte super full
coverage and usually those kinds of
foundations look really cakey on me so I
don't know let me know if I'm gonna do
like a first impressions of me wearing
this throughout the day if it really
does last a long time let me know I also
hear that it oxidizes pretty badly which
worries me okay another foundation II
type of product I've never heard of this
brand and I was really intrigued by the
claims this is from the brand called
sweat
I believe the brand is called sweat it
says sweat for active beauty and this is
a mineral foundation it has SPF 30 and
it is water resistant for up to 80
minutes I have a twist up brush comes in
this like packaging right here this is
the foundation this tiny little driver
here this is a mineral foundation which
looks like there's not much product in
this actually how many ounces 1.09
ounces that's like nothing oh my gosh oh
that's us but anyway it comes with this
like contraption right that you're
supposed to I've never tried this before
so I don't know what you're supposed
okay look it comes with a brush I hit
wow that's the first time I open this
and you're supposed to like buff it onto
your skin like this and you're supposed
to also put let me see you're supposed
to open this I think I'm so confused
holding twist brush up right load pot
gently screw pot upwards until it stops
oh oh I see okay okay so now it's it's
in there good oh cool
okay remove twist brush cap then turn
base to expose the brush
we've already don't let wake up
gently shake and downward angle then
apply to face as desired and sweat to
clean pull up on brush and rinse with
warm water okay this comes off like that
oh pretty cool so you're supposed to
like shake okay yeah oh yeah
powder is product is really coming out
on this OH
but anyway besides the fact that it has
like no product in here it's a very
small little tub it says it has natural
ingredients UV protection it's
refillable oh yeah you can also buy
these separately so once you run out of
the product you don't have to go and buy
the whole thing I thought it would be so
cool to buy this to put this to the test
I am thinking when I saw this online I
thought it would be a great idea to do a
video where I put this on like apply
makeup I don't put on makeup when I
workout I hate working out in makeup but
I thought it would be really cool if I
did a video like a demo of first
impressions where I put this on my
entire face kind of like as a mineral
foundation and then workout go do my
usual workout and then come back and
show you guys how it held up let me know
if that's something you would be
interested in because for those of you
who do like to wear makeup to the gym
this might be something to think about I
don't
this has really shitty reviews on the
Sephora website though I'm not gonna lie
not the best reviews but decided to get
it anyway okay so next up I got this
logo right here this is from the brand
josie maran and it is they're a surreal
skin Aragon finishing balm I saw this on
the just arrived section as well and I
thought it was very very interesting
this is what it looks like um it's
really really pretty packaging the first
time I opened this I thought I was
missing like a huge chunk because look
at this do you see that hole it's a very
big hole but I'm sure it's just that the
product gathered around the edges
whatever anyway this is supposed to be
kind of like a skin care product slash
makeup primer this creamy whipped
lightweight formula finishes both your
skincare and makeup routine for a smooth
long-lasting radiant glow makeup glides
on seamlessly I've been using it as a
primer and it does hydrate my skin
really nicely it gives me kind of like
the feeling of a moisturizer not exactly
sure if this is 100% necessary
it's something I have to play with a
little bit more but it does feel like a
nice hydrating moisturizer to be
completely honest with you I got this a
Bobbi Brown highlighting powder I got
mine in the shade afternoon glow and
this is what it looks like it's a nice
pinky highlight it's the highlight I'm
wearing on my face right now and this is
the kind of texture that is not powder
you know like when you put your finger
in this kind of highlight it doesn't
feel powdery at all and I have just come
to the conclusion that I prefer a
powdery highlight because this is the
kind of formula that looks really
beautiful from afar like it gives you
the most beautiful beautiful glow from a
distance but when you get really close
to my face you kind of see the highlight
sitting on top of my skin it looks
almost glittery even though there are no
glitters in here I don't know if I'm
making any sense like you can kind of
see the texture of the highlight not the
texture of my skin but you know I have
highlight on my face this is still a
stunning color and if you're into this
kind of formula it is a beautiful
beautiful color okay and then the rest
of the products oh my gosh they're all
lip products I went ham ham urban decay
recently came out with a new vice
lipsticks and they sent me about 10 of
them in the mail and I really really
loved the formula of them but I picked
up five of them I got mostly news but
then I got to fun colors as well this
one is called insanity and it is a cream
finish and this is the lipstick I'm
wearing right now I really really love
their creamy finishes because they're
really like kind of glossy looking so
comfortable and they're full color and
they're just they have a beautiful Sheen
to them I love the peach enos and this
lipstick really beautiful I'm really
loving that that one was insanity then I
got this one this one is in the shade
tantric this one is more pink and this
is a sheer finish finish as opposed to a
cream and it's just a really pretty
light baby pinky color and for colors
like this I don't mind sheer coverage
because it looks just so nice on top of
a lip liner just to give yourself a nice
light flush of color really pretty if
you're intimidated by lipstick a sheer
finish is a little bit more wearable and
then I got 1993 and this is their
comfort matte which means it's a nice
lipstick but it is comfortable I haven't
worn this one yet
but it's like the exact same color as
their 1993 lip liner I have a lip liner
already and I wanted the matching
lipstick it's a really beautiful brown
but it's not too Brown and I've tried
their other comfort mats and I really
really do like them and then the two fun
colors I got or junkie and Savage I got
junkie because I don't really have green
lipstick and I know that that's not very
wearable but I thought for a fun look
why not and this is like their metallic
finish so it's a very very very shimmery
green color probably only would wear
this like on I don't know st. Patrick's
Day or something but I don't have
anything like it so I decided to give it
a try I promise you I know it sounds
dumb but the only reason I bought savage
is because that's what I call saline
like Celine's new nickname in this house
is Savage
she's a savage she really is so when I
saw this lipstick online and reminded me
of my dog so I bought it and plus it is
a stunning hot pink color like how cool
would this look with like an orange
eyeliner and then like a hot pink lip
for summer and this is actually their
mega matte finish which it isn't as
creamy and comfortable as their comfort
mat but I still don't think that it's
very drying so yeah really cool and then
I have three more products to share with
you and they're also lip products
I got two bite Beauty lipsticks I'm
obsessed with the formula of this this
is their new a mousse boosh lipsticks
they sent me a few of them I fell in
love and I bought a ton of colors and
then I saw these two I didn't have these
I wanted to buy them these are actually
really cool colors as well this one is
in the shade squid ink which you can't
really tell in the bullet but it's a
navy blue like a deep navy blue my
newest obsession recently has been blue
lipstick but like a deeper blue lipstick
I don't know what's up with me but I've
been on the hunt for the perfect deep
blue lipstick and this one is squid ink
and I really really love this formula
and then I also got this one which is
called kale which is a green lipstick I
know another green lipstick I don't know
why but it's completely different from
the Urban Decay one because this is like
almost
a black green it's a super super dark
green this would look so cool for like a
grungy makeup look and then the last
product I got Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lipstick I have most of these but
I didn't have this one this one is in
the shade echo and like I said I've been
on the hunt for the perfect navy blue
lip color this one is kind of like a
royal purpley blue there's a little bit
of purple in this one it's amazing and
when it comes to bold colors I do love
lipsticks and I love those lipsticks but
when it comes to bold colors I prefer a
liquid lipstick just because they stay
in place and they don't get everywhere I
cannot wait to try this so yeah that
