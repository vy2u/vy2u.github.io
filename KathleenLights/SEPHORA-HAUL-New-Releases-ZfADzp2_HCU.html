except for aha obviously this is this is
different please excuse this for now I'm
still trying to set up my room as you
guys know I have been changing my room
for like literally eight months and I'm
moving things around I'm changing things
up and it's literally like the middle of
the night so my lighting is awful I
usually always have natural lighting so
if my landing looks weird that is why
and I'm still trying to decide what I
want to do with my setup like what kind
of backgrounds I want to do I'm still
gonna do my background with the lights
and my vanity like I will always have my
vanity I'm still gonna do that and also
when I film makeup tutorials I always
face my window my windows right here so
I always have like my computer desk
behind me that's so gonna be happening
but I want like a variety in this room
to kind of switch up the background
every once in a while so I'm not done
organizing this this looks like a hot
mess right now so please ignore this I'm
just trying to seeing what I want to do
and how I want to set things up so
here's a test run
but anyway so today's video is a Sephora
haul I just recently picked up a few
things on Sephora and I wanted to share
them with you guys did get like a crap
ton of stuff but I got some things I had
my eyes on and I don't know if I want to
share them with you guys today so the
first thing I want to show you is this
really cool makeup bag it's a little bit
bigger than I would like it's like very
large and in charge but I loved the look
of this so much I was like yes I want
that it reminds me so much of like the
fenty Beauty line the new Holiday
Collection kind of has this packaging
it's like very galactic and Spacey and I
really really love this bag it's really
cute because I mean Sephora comes out
with bags like this all the time
depending on the season but it just has
a little pocket on the top you could put
your brushes right here in the little
slits I had it back just like this that
I got like last summer that I bought
from Sephora but I ended up giving that
one to my mom and then here is like the
entire space where you put all your
stuff in so I wanted to pick this up
it's so so pretty I love it but anyway
now that I got that out of the way I
picked up the huda beauty faux filter
foundation I was so excited to get this
I've had my eye on this ever since I saw
swatches online I picked up mine in the
shade creme brulee and here's the thing
I kind of just guessed my shade I'm
usually very good at guessing my shade
online like if they have a description
like fair to light skin tones with a
warm undertone like if it has a
description I'm usually really good at
my shade so I picked up creme brulee and
then when I got it in the mail I was
like oh my gosh this is so gonna be
perfect for me that's gonna match me
perfectly but it actually comes out a
lot whiter than it looks in the bottle
I'm not sure if you can tell but as I
was blending it onto my skin I was like
oh my gosh this is like too pale for me
so I have to get a darker shade this is
the foundation I'm wearing on my face
right now but I had to apply a lot a lot
of bronzer but I feel like this is my
perfect like natural skin color because
right now I have a little bit of a tan
on but I feel like this would match me
perfectly without a pen so I do want to
try out a different color just to give
it a fair shot because I don't know how
I feel about it yet I really like how it
looks I like how it feels on the skin it
was really easy to blend I used the
brush at first a brush that I'll show
you in a second but then I didn't really
love it so I just started applying it
with my Beauty Blender and I loved how
it applied with my Beauty Blender so the
finish was really nice but I was just
thrown off by the color you know so I
really want to try out a different color
but I think I'm really gonna like this I
really like this packaging you know a
lot of people don't like the fact that
this is plastic instead of glass but I
break everything I drop everything so a
part of me kind of really loves this
foundation I feel like it would be like
easy to travel with it's not gonna break
you know and shatter everywhere I also
bought the hooda Beauty complexion
perfection pre makeup base I'm also
wearing this underneath my foundation
right now I definitely want to try out
this foundation without this primer to
see if I end up liking it more or less
you know because this primer is very
interesting I think I really like it it
feels like a moisturizer as you're
applying it to your skin but once you
really start working it in it kind of
gets a little tacky and a little bit
sticky and I feel like that really helps
the foundations stick to it I love tacky
primers especially for my dry skin I
feel like they create a nice barrier
between the foundation and my skin and I
really like how the foundation applied
on top of it I like this combo but I
will keep you updated on this but so far
so good
I also got the brush that she released
with Miss Foundation it's the hooter
beauty
flexion brush the blend and buff
complexion brush and I don't like this
okay not that I don't like this it was
fine it was fine but you know what I
think it was a little bit difficult to
blend on my skin because of the tacky
primer feel like it was a little bit
sticky and it was kind of hard to blend
around with a brush once you started
using like a damp sponge it blended in
perfectly so I don't know I have to try
this brush out again with that
foundation without the primer but I
don't know if I love it it is $25 I
don't know if it's worse than $25 and
know what I'm saying I'll keep you
updated on that but okay I got some hair
stuff this is from a brand I had never
heard of before I got to Sephora I can't
even pronounce that last name but it's
Vernon Francoise this is the nourishing
water mist supposed to wet the hair
while infusing it with a blend of amino
acids which help to repair strengthen
and protect it from color fading so I
wanted to give this a go I actually got
it just for the packaging I thought the
packaging was own that's an aggressive
mist oh that's a long mist you see my
hair actually is not wet am I supposed
to lose when it's wet shake before use
hold approximately 30 centimeters away
spray liberally onto roots
medium length and end of dry hair okay
okay I could do a dry this was actually
a really stupid idea since my hair is
kind of ironed a little bit and that's
just gonna frizz it right up but anyway
I got this if any of you have tried out
this brand let me know what you think
about it is it good the mere thoughts
below I got two things from Pat McGrath
I really like Pat McGrath I know that
her stuff is super super fancy like Dez
expensive but the stuff is actually
really good quality I am NOT crazy about
like the highlights and all the other
stuff that she came out with but I was
really interested in these little
lipsticks these Rito for $38 so so
they're pricey but I have heard nothing
but good things about these lipsticks
and I wanted to get one for myself this
is the Matt trance lipstick and I got
mine in the shade
1995 I like that name that's so cute
it's actually the lipstick I'm wearing
right now I love it it's so weird it
kind of has a powder formula like it
feels like a lipstick while you're
applying it but then it dries on your
lips almost like a very thin powdery
texture but it's not drying I don't know
I really really like this formula do I
think it's worth the $38 I'm not sure I
have to try it out a little bit more I
have to wear it throughout the day
really give it a test but they love this
packaging it is so pretty the other
thing I got from Pat McGrath Labs is the
perma gel ultra lip pencil and I think
I'm in love it feels like just any old
typical lip liner the only thing I don't
like about this lip liner is you do have
to sharpen it it comes with a sharpener
but I don't like the fact that I have to
sharpen eight I got mine in the shade
done undone and I love this lip liner I
wore today for the first time and I fell
in love as I was applying it for some
reason it was like really easy to
overdraw my lips and to make them look a
little bit bigger than they are because
they're not normally this size so it was
really easy to get like a perfect
overdrawn lip with this I don't know if
it was the color or the formula but it
was very creamy it just glides on and
this color specifically has like a very
almost unnoticeable Sheen to it it's
like not like a flat matte lip liner
there's a little bit of something to it
so I really love this color and this
formula feels really really nice do I
think there are dupes out there possibly
the colour-pop ones feel very similar to
this and they're way way cheaper so just
keep that in mind but so far so good I
really like this one alright so next
thing I got was this and for some reason
I was so intrigued by this thing I
cannot wait to try it it's from the
brand la vanilla they make the really
healthy like deodorants and this is the
healthy underarm detox mask it's a brush
on mask that has charcoal malic acid
silica and it helps remove aluminum and
impurities from the underarm area which
you know aluminum is not very good for
you and the reason I really wanted to
try it it says it's supposed to ease and
shorten the transition to natural
deodorant while nourishing and
lightining your underarm area so I
cannot wait to try this
hold it's really good like I have such
high hopes like please be good I'm so so
excited apply an even layer to clean dry
underarms leave on for 5 minutes and
rinse with warm water
for best results to use one to two times
a week I want to see what this looks
like oh my gosh okay yeah I just really
smell like anything I'm gonna use these
on my pits today so I've been really
wanting to try out this dry shampoo it's
from bumble and bumble so I got the
little version because I didn't know if
I was gonna like it or not and it's the
powder tres invisible nourishing dry
shampoo with hibiscus extract for dry or
damaged hair I have dry damaged hair so
I really wanted to try this out yeah I
don't know if I like it I don't know if
I like I'm very picky with my dry
shampoo I don't look for a volume or
anything like that I strictly use dry
shampoo to make my hair look cleaner you
know just so I can go one extra day
without washing my hair I don't know if
it was because this had no white cast
but I wasn't sure if I was applying too
much or if I wasn't applying enough
sometimes I like to see that white cast
believe it or not because I really don't
know what I'm doing if I don't so I
think I applied too little but I found
that it wasn't really doing anything I
didn't feel like it made my hair any
cleaner or at least any less oily I
don't know I have to try it out a little
bit more because I was kind of thrown
off based on first impressions so let me
know in the comments below if you like
this I guess is this your Holy Grail
product so you really love it or do you
hate it let me know down below I'd love
to know your opinion on this all right
and in the last four things I purchased
are from the Fenty Beauty Holiday
Collection I was so excited when I saw
this and I kind of picked up like one
product from each category the only
thing I didn't get was the eyeshadow
palette because if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys I don't
know what it is about the palette that I
don't like like I look at it and I'm not
inspired by it I don't know what it is
about it I don't know if it's the fact
that it's all shimmers there's something
about the palette that just doesn't call
for me I don't I don't love it but I do
want to purchase a few other things so I
got the eyeshadow brush this is the
galaxy 2 way I shadow brush and I
honestly wanted it just for the
packaging I love this galaxy themed
packaging she's got going on I think it
is so so pretty look at me
that is really pretty I don't like
double-ended brushes but I don't mind
them when the other side is kind of
stiff like this because you can still
store it and not mess up the brush since
it is like small dense and stiff so this
looks like a really good brush you know
like to pack on color on the lid and
then to like smudge on the lower lash
line so I love this I like double ender
brushes to travel with and then I got
this Eclipse two-in-one glitter relief
eyeliner and I was really confused by
this but apparently it's a transforming
metallic to glitter formula so you're
supposed to apply this to your eyes like
an eyeliner like I did today and the
little bits of glitter do peek through I
don't know if you can see the shade I
got is neptr which by the way is the
cutest name of ever neptr I got this
color because it's kind of like a dark
dark dark black green and then it has
like a little green flecks in it like
little sparkles and you can kind of see
the sparkle on my eye but it says to
really activate the glitter to make it
pop you're supposed to rub your eyes
when it's completely dry for a custom
glitter effect which makes me a little
bit nervous because I don't want to mess
up the eyeliner but I am gonna go ahead
and try to rub it in you guys probably
can't see from there but oh yeah oh wow
okay so it really does activate the
glitters it's very similar to the ciate
lip glitters we made a video on not too
long ago where you would rub your lips
together and that would activate the
glitter that's kind of like what's
happening here let me see if I can zoom
you guys in okay so this is the eyeliner
without it being rubbed in like without
activating the glitter you could kind of
see the sparkle and then this is after I
rubbed my eye so I think that's really
really cool you can use this eyeliner
both ways the only thing I would be
worried about is if you rub a little bit
too hard you might mess up your eyeliner
like you might actually take off your
eyeliner trying to activate the glitter
you know what I mean but it is a really
cool effect I mean look at that and
really just like activates the glitter I
think that is so cool I really like that
I mean I'm into that I don't love the
brush it was a little bit difficult to
work with I'm not great with eyeliner so
you probably could tell there that it's
a little wonky I'm not the best at it
but I found it to be a little bit
difficult to work with but I still made
and I actually really really like this I
think it's fun and then I got this
starlit hyper glitz lipstick I love this
packaging look at this happy honestly I
bought it just for the packaging alone
because I knew I wasn't really gonna be
into a lip product like this and I was
right I don't love it I think I just
don't love the color I got but it looked
like the most natural color out of all
of them this one is called starlet did I
say that already it's pretty but it's
just extremely foiled it's like a
metallic orange e nudie peach and the
first time I applied it I was like woah
woah I'm not into this I'm not into this
but when I tapped it in and kind of
blended it out it did look a little bit
more wearable that way so I was able to
make it work but I personally think it's
just a little bit too intense for me but
I just love this packaging and I think
with like a really good lip liner
underneath and then like an opaque lip
gloss on top that isn't as shimmery I
could totally make this work and then
the last thing I got in this ha is the
fenty Beauty cosmic gloss lip glitter
and this is in the shade spacesuit look
how cool this lip gloss looks I mean
this looks incredible color so pretty
it's like pink and orange ewwww I love
it the only thing is I'm a little bit
nervous because I hear a couple people
saying that this is kind of like a lip
plumper like it makes your lips tingly
and stuff and I'm not really into lip
plumpers that much but I'm actually
gonna try it on right now why not on top
of this
it does have a really pretty iridescent
to it all right no but I hope it's not
like lip plumping but anyway guys that
completes this video these were all the
things I recently just picked up from
Sephora I actually just waste a huge elf
order on eyes lips face com I purchased
so many things they have a ton of new
makeup definitely let me know down below
if you want to see an elf haul next like
let me know let me know I don't know if
two hauls back-to-back are too much but
let me know if you want to see an elf ha

that completes this video thank you so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
