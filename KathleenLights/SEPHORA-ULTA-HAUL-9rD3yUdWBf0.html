a haul I know you're thinking then you
just do a haul like a huge haul like
yesterday and yes I know but that was a
drugstore haul and I was recently on the
support website and I bought a couple of
things and I was also on the older web
site and I bought a couple of things
there as well most of it is high-end but
I don't use drugstore products to share
with you i buy things to review for my
channel ok that's what brings me joy at
25 I got a new hair product so this is
from the brand mazzani mazzani um I'm
not exactly sure how to pronounce this
brand but it is the scalp care
conditioner it's supposed to be an anti
dandruff conditioner
it has peppermint oil and cucumber
extract and I got this because I'm not a
huge fan of dandruff shampoos I find it
they really strip my hair because my
hair is so so dry on its own so what I
thought this I was like wait a minute
anti dandruff conditioner that sounds
weird because usually you massage the
dandruff shampoo like into your scalp to
help with the dandruff but I never put
conditioner like at my scalp yes this
says it's a scalp care conditioner so
I'm excited to try it it I hope it
doesn't make my hair too greasy I
wouldn't say I have like a dandruff
problem but every once in a while if I
use certain hair sprays certain dry
shampoos I can get like the little fleas
so I don't know if this will keep it at
bay I'm not sure I've never even tried
this let me know in the comments below
if you tried this I bought it at Ulta
next up is this guy that I got at
Sephora and I thought it was a great
value this is a $75 thing like I paid
$75 for this and I know that some insane
but I love the Beauty Blender so much
that I do think it's worth it for me
because each sponge is twenty dollars
and I buy Beauty blenders anyway so I
figured I can save some money by just
buying this whole kit it's so available
on Sephora the only thing that sucks is
that I really really really really hate
the red Beauty Blender so you know what
I guess I'm not really saving that much
money am i I'm technically only saving
five dollars because I will not use the
red Beauty Blender because it's horrible
it bleeds everywhere in the sink it like
it oh so maybe this isn't the best value
for me but you know what if you like the
red Beauty Blender and you use Beauty
blenders all the time this would be a
perfect set for you so I do get PR
part but it's never really for sure like
I get PR for certain collection they'll
send me certain like really big launches
but other launches they won't which is
totally fine I don't mind I went out I
got this palette because I've heard so
many people raving about it I just have
to try it out for myself
this is the Tarte TARDIS pro Amazonian
clay palette and I love their Amazonian
clay formula right after that I have to
say I do not like how much this weighs
this is like the heaviest palette I own
it's so heavy but I mean it has a
ginormous mirror look at that cute
mirror like you could totally take this
with you to travel and you don't need a
mirror this is the best mirror ever I
saw so many people talking about this in
their yearly favorites videos and I love
how it's set up you have like your brown
isle your purple iron iron your
cranberry Isle and then like your more
neutral isle with a little pop of blue
at the end you have a black you have a
light color you have transition shades
you have so many colors and it smells
like vanilla cocoa it smells exactly
like the Too Faced chocolate bar palette
I mean all of the Tarte palette smell
like this mal I feel kind of feeling to
face under a little bit but that's okay
and then the other palette I got like a
week ago so I threw away two packaging
this is the tarte maneater palette
another palette from tarte and to be
honest i didn't think i was going to buy
this just because the packaging it's
like I gotta be honest there's something
about cheetah print that just throws me
off
Rosie the wrong way I don't know what it
is but anyway I love this palette it is
so good it's so compact so perfect to
travel it has a mirror and it has eight
eyeshadows that just scream my name this
is the palette I'm wearing on my eyes
today I actually have this color like
right here this is the shimmer shade I
have and then these smushed underneath
my eyes and then I have this in my inner
corner I used this entire palette you
can get a full look with this the only
thing I wish the one thing that would
make this be perfect literally the
perfect palette would be if they kind of
like split this shade in the middle they
didn't make it so big and then they
added one more shade right here and they
made it like a black oh my gosh if that
were the case this will be the perfect
freakin palette I highly recommend it I
think it's exclusive to all so that's
where I bought it it's fantastic my next
product is a drugstore foundation this
is the Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating
tint with hyaluronic
it says it's supposed to moisturize and
plump skin for 24 hours I got mine in
the shade for dnews practically wearing
the foundation today immediately when I
first applied it I was like this is my
fav foundation it's amazing it looks
beautiful
I'm obsessed but but it does settle into
my lines right here I have like these
smile lines that I hate foundation loves
to sink into those and a little bit on
my forehead as well so just keep that in
mind this is definitely a foundation I
feel kind of sinks into the fine lines
but besides that it blends it out so
easily like nothing it comes in the
exact same packaging is that Clinique
foundation with the doe foot applicator
wand and I kind of just like stamp this
all over my face and blend it out with a
brush and it blends it out perfectly
besides the issue I told you I love it I
also don't love that it's kind of tacky
you definitely want to set this down but
it's so hydrating it almost feels cool
when you put it on your face it's like
the weirdest I don't have my clean it
but as you're blending it in it's like
feels cold on the face like so I picked
this up on the Sephora website this is
the marula intensive care treatment and
styling oil and I bought this because I
have been wanting to go like silicone
free with my hair products and this is
silicone free it also has this color
safe and it means
frizz and repairs strands it's also for
coarse curly or thick hair that being
said I do not have to take hair like I
have a lot of hair I would say but it's
very very very fine
look at this look at this look I just
brush my hair to make any sudden
movements like my hair gets knotted so
maybe this isn't the best but I wanted a
silicone free oil so I bought this one
and it comes in this really beautiful
bottle like nice and peachy and I'm
going to trace them actually right now
I'm just going to put them in my hand
doesn't feel sick at all gonna put some
on my ends you okay not bad my hair
feels nice and soft nice and shiny I
will continue to use this oh my gosh
look how cool okay I don't know if this
is new but Ardell came out with faux
mink falsies when I saw this on the also
website I nearly peed myself
I love ardell lashes but I've always
wanted that
to come out with the kind of wispy lash
that look like real hairs even though
they're wispy they're beautiful and they
look real but I wanted something even
flutter here and more like natural and
hair looking and they've added my braids
they came out with full mink falsies and
these say that they are luxuriously
lightweight with an invisible so the
band is clear and they are beautiful
they look so stunning I cannot wait to
try this on my eyes and they just look
so promising so this product that was
supposed to try out today and then let
you know what I thought about it but I
didn't use it because I'm a 90s Minardi
it obvious a nerd and an idiot and what
this is the Al Genest
splash hydrating setting mist I need to
stop buying setting sprays I really need
to stop it's gotten out of hands but I
really wanted to try this one because it
says here on the back that it refreshes
and cools the skin while providing a
weightless feel it's supposed to be a
hydrating serum like in a mist and
supposedly it also makes your makeup
last all day cuz like a bunch of crap in
here and has seawater seaport extract I
don't know a bunch of stuff and I was
supposed to use today but I just used my
Milani setting spray instead it's just
been habit for me but I'm still going to
use this and try it out because I really
like the claims it's not like your
average setting spray so let's see how
the mist is hmm not my favorite I
already know I already know because look
look at the mist on the Milani one it's
like perfect ah you hear that that's
like perfect this one's like actually
that's not so bad
I still have high hopes for this I'll go
to school ok so so far came out with an
highlighting palette this is their
luminizing palette I'm sorry
it comes with six shades and I was so
excited when I saw it I tell myself that
after this haul I would be on a makeup
no buy I definitely don't need any more
so I'm forcing myself to only buy a
makeup item if it's brand new and you
guys want me to review it or you're like
curious about it that's the only time
I'm going to buy makeup okay I'm gonna
know why but anyway so this is what the
illuminating palette looks like I like
the packaging it's cute and you get six
highlighting shades and I like the color
collection feel like you can really
target a bunch of different skin tones
with this I really like these I'm
actually wearing this highlight on my
face right now I mixed it with another
highlight I'm about to show you here in
a second this color gives you a really
pretty natural high
like a lit from within glow is so
beautiful I really like this white one
and I really like this gold shade right
here
this dark pink one is really pretty too
but it's just too dark for me the only
colors I don't like are these two right
here I find that they are not as
blendable as the other shades there's
just a little bit chunky and a little
bit too glittery for me but I like the
rest of them so I do think that this
palette is still a hit I think this is
nice if you see it in the Sephora store
definitely swatch them and check them
out but the other highlight I'm wearing
on my face I actually layered it on top
of that white gold this is let me show
you this is the Stila heaven -
highlighter and I got the shade hidden
this is the strangest freaking highlight
ever okay so this is what it looks like
it's the strangest formula ever like
when you put your finger in you
definitely think that this is a cream it
feels wet oh my god business of cream
yeah I have to be a cream this is not a
powder but when you apply it to the skin
it doesn't apply like a cream and
applies like if it's nothing it's like a
jelly formula is so we were at first I
didn't like because I didn't feel like
any color was really coming off it's a
learning curve though I wouldn't use a
natural haired brush I would only use a
synthetic highlighting brush for this
product you have to use something like
this this is the Real Techniques setting
brush and it's synthetic so it picks up
the products a lot better I read a lot
of negative reviews on this but it's
something you have to work with it you
have to try to love it and then you will
I bought 2 blush palettes one from the
drugstore and one Nitai end this one the
drugstore is called the NYX was from NYX
it is their sweet cheeks blush palette
and it comes with a ton of colors I
actually bought this one on the NYX
website I believe and this has a huge
color selection you get two shimmery
blush which could be highlights
depending on your skin tone a neutral
one a peachy one and then some team I do
wish they had like one more nude in here
I'm wearing this blush right now layered
with one of these blushes but mostly
just this one I've only used one so I
can only base my opinion on this I liked
it I think it blended out really nicely
it wasn't chalky I can't wait to try out
the rest they feel really nice the only
one that feels kind of stiff and gritty
is this one right here with the red feel
nice when i swatched them
very very pigmented you need a very
light hand with this if you have a happy
can be careful
and then this palette is like the exact
opposite like you can apply and apply
and apply and it never looks like it's
too much it's a new ambient strobe
lighting blush palette I also get PR
from hourglass but I never know what
they're going to send and when I saw
this I just had to smash it up I thought
it would be perfect to travel with
because you have like a really pretty
neutral almost wrong shade a mauve and
then a nice pretty corally pink these
have glitter in them these have shimmer
which you guys know I don't like but I
don't mind them in my blushes as long as
it's not chunky and these don't feel
chunky I'm wearing this color right now
kind of dusted a little bit on top of
that other blush and they just blend out
like a dream there's such nice powders
they give your cheeks a nice glow
without adding like too much sparkle
okay so have one more product to share
with you and then the rest are lip
products I went mid crazy so next
release a mixing medium I got so excited
because I feel like the only brand I
know that does a mixing medium is Mac I
haven't really seen one at the drugstore
so these are amazing because you can mix
this with any powder eyeshadow and turn
it into a liquid eyeliner especially
pigment like if you scoop a little bit
of a pigment out onto your hand add a
little bit of this little mixing medium
mix it all up and then it turns into a
liquid eyeshadow it's awesome there's a
ton of ways you can use a mixing medium
and I hope this one is just as good as
the Mac one such a useful little guy I
had to pick it up so Sephora collection
came out with a crapload a crapload of
new liquid lipsticks I totally for so
long they have like 10 liquid lipsticks
and they weren't expanding their line at
all I picked them 7 of the new shades I
don't know if I got all of them or maybe
I missed a few the only thing I don't
like is that these are not named they're
just like numbered like this one's
called 39 some is called 25 nothing
spicy about that but you know that's
okay I haven't even opened these the
only one I have tried on my lips is the
new word oh no it's still in here ok I
picked up eight not seven and I did try
out this one already this is called 32
it's a really pretty nude it's very very
very nude but
like that so I love this color I think
this formula is really really nice
they're not too drying for a liquid
lipstick I think they're pretty
hydrating and now with the new color
selection it's awesome I haven't watched
any of these at all but I'll show you
close-up swatches I already know the
formula is good
so I mean I'm excited to have all these
cool like news so my community has these
matte creme lip crayons that I really
really liked but they released one in
the shade cava which if you don't like
Beauty you know that they had their
creme lipsticks I forgot what they were
called but they were amazing and they
discontinued them something wrong I love
the ones they replace them with their
amuse-bouche lipsticks are amazing cava
was one of the coolest colors they had
red Sina is my favorite I have a couple
backups of that lipstick because it's
just amazing but cava was wonderful with
a really cool toned mob and they
released that shade in a matte crème
crayon so we can still have common out
so awesome because I love this formula
so much I feel like these are so
underrated cognac is one of my favorite
brown colors to wear on my lips ever
like out of every brown lipstick I know
they're really really really good such a
pretty cool tone Bobbie pink really
really stunning I highly recommend these
if you have not checked these out
they're so incredible definitely worth
the money okay so we're about done I
just have three more lip products I
bought some liquid lipsticks you have a
J Catholic Trinity matte lip kiss proof
liquid the fix both my back it says lip
gloss but there's ain't no little Oh J
cap is a really really affordable brand
that you can find out also that's where
I bought these and why authorities were
available I really wanted to try them
out I'm actually wearing one of them
right now I'm wearing this shade right
here this one is called wandering eyes
and then I have a more like warmer Brown
called tonight my name is and then this
one is a really really pretty everyday
pink this one is called champagne blood
now when they say their kiss proof
they're not kidding like these do not
transfer probably because they don't
transfer they do look a little drying on
the lips but they don't feel drying like
I don't feel like my lips feel dry but
personally don't mind I actually don't
mind a dry liquid lipstick I like that
they don't transfer
the kind that I wear if I know I'm going
to go out and eat like a really huge
meal because they do not come off I
saved my more hydrating ones for like
day to day the only thing I don't like
I leave for this color right here the
one I'm wearing is pretty pasty I have
to wait for it to dry and then do a
second layer so this is two layers of
this color and so if I got really up
close to your face
you would see that it is slightly patchy
so that's the only thing I don't like
but with that being inside of these are
extremely affordable they're only a few
dollars and I definitely think they're
worth checking out you give a little and
you get a little you got to work with it
you got to build it up it's a little
patchy but you know it's cheap so yeah
