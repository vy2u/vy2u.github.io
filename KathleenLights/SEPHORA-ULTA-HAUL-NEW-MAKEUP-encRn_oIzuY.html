a Sephora and Ulta haul mainly a Sephora
haul but I did purchase a couple things
that I do want to share with you guys
but these are products I got during
these two forms vib sale I just don't
know when I'm posting this video because
I'm in the middle of pre recording and
there's a lot going on so I don't know
how far after the vib sale I'm posting
this but I had a whole video
recommending products to you guys so
it's not my fault
now fault have you missed the sale but
these are just products I picked up
during the sale I wanted to save 15% and
I also got some stuff up Ulta and I'm
gonna share them with you guys it's not
a bunch of stuff
but a few of these things are breeding
people I see pretty pricy just because I
really wanted to try it out since there
was already a sale going on I took
advantage of the sale by the way ignore
my hair and I want here right now after
I found this video actually I'm gonna
take off my makeup take a shower wash my
hair I feel like I always look like a
watermelon head every time I do a button
I know I have a huge forehead I'm
totally okay with it used to bother me
as a child but I have a big for it and I
feel I couldn't have my hair in a bun
you're gonna really see how big my whole
hair day so let's start off with the
things at Sephora okay so I purchased a
perfume I know my perfumes go back
before I can finish them up but it's an
addiction I love trying out new perfumes
and then I saw that they came out with
flower bomb nectar I don't know if this
is limited edition or not but when I was
reading the notes and I was reading like
about the perfume yes by the way I did
purchase this without smelling it I
don't recommend you do that at home I
just I can tell if I'm gonna like
something based off of the notes
basically everyone was just saying that
it was like flower bomb but sweeter
which I love flower bomb and I love
sweet perfumes so I was like a sweeter
version I'm all about it so it's called
nectar and I actually took this with me
to Canada and to New York this is what I
traveled with not ideal for traveling
I'm gonna say but I really wanted to
give it a fair shot before this haul so
I can tell you but I love the scent it
has that flower bomb base to it you know
what I'm talking about like that you
know
like that flower bamhi scent but it is a
sweeter version kind of reminds me like
if they dropped a little bit of cotton
candy in the original flower bomb that
is definitely what I smell so I was very
very pleasantly surprised I think it
smells wonderful and it does last a very
long time on my skin not as long as the
original though that one is like but it
does last a long time immediately when
you spray it is very very sweet almost
like holy crap the more you wear it the
more like you know sinks in with your
natural scent and I really really like
how it smells if I had to choose between
this and the original I would go with
the original I think the original smells
just a little bit better there's nothing
like that classic Flowerbomb scent but
if you wish Flowerbomb was a little bit
sweeter then I think you will love
nectar it is smell that like that but
it's delicious okay so I don't know if I
had a dream that I already purchased
this palette or what but I could have
sworn I had bought the visor or visie
art still don't know how to say tryst
palette and they have another palette
that's in a similar packaging but it's
gold this is like the rose gold one I
know I have the gold one but I could
have sworn I bought this rose gold one
but I guess not but I decided to pick it
up during the vib sale because these
vies are busier palettes are very very
expensive and I really wanted to pick
this one up because it was full of just
like really pretty peachy pink colors
and like berry tones and I'm typically
not super drawn to colors like this like
if I saw this in a random palette at
Sephora I don't know if I would
necessarily run to pick it up but I was
really impressed with the gold palette
that looks like this that I really
wanted to pick up the triste one and I
didn't look the other day with this
shade this color is so gorgeous and
buttery but like super pigmented and
boiled I didn't have an issue blending
they lasted all day on the eyes and I
really really like them do I think that
this palette is worth the money I don't
know I liked the gold one a little bit
more than this one if you're a die-hard
vines art girl then you will love this
but for me I have other palettes in my
collection I like more so I got no their
eyeshadow palette this one was also
ridiculously priced but I got the pop I
don't know why I apologize I'm such a
fool this is the Pat McGrath motherships
sublime palette and this is the bronze
ambition one I have the pink one and I
love it
no it's so much money for six little
eyeshadows but I think Pat McGrath
eyeshadows are so good I even think
they're a little bit better than visi
our eyes are some ones coming out of
fate I feel like Pat McGrath are a
little bit more foiled but these are
just basic standard bronzy gold
eyeshadows and I don't know why I bought
it this was for sure an impulse buy like
I I wasn't thinking I loved the
packaging I don't know I mean the
formula is incredible these eyeshadows
are beautiful they're amazing but dude
it's six eyeshadows and that's like a
fifty five dollar palette I don't know
totally I I I don't think it's worth it
just just saying and it's kind of bulky
for just six eyeshadows let me think
about it
this is turning into a very depressing
haul but I purchased it I did and I did
a look with it and I loved it I looked
so chocolaty and bronzy but I don't know
I don't know man
okay so this was another impulse perch
perch another both perch I don't know
for some reason every time I hear sale
at Sephora I like run to the tom for
section I don't really love Tom Ford
makeup all that much there's a ton of
things that I've tried out that I
haven't been impressed with but for some
reason I was really eyeing this this is
the cream cheek color and this is in the
shade
piano solo piano solo piano solo but
it's a beautiful copper cream blush and
this is actually the blush I'm wearing
on my face right now and it is so glowy
the only parts where I highlighted my
face I have on the anastacio I'm reezy
highlighter but I only have it on right
here in this little tiny section on both
sides like right up here by my eyes the
rest of the glow on my face like right
here that's this that is this creamy
cheeky blushy product first time I used
this I did not like it because honestly
it took me like 20 dips to build this up
this is a very sheer blush you do have
to build it up quite a bit to get a
significant amount on your cheeks but my
favorite way
it has been with the elf stipple brush
this is just like the small traveling
one they have a big one but for some
reason I think the small traveling one
is better but that's probably just like
my brain but I use the elf simple brush
get up in there and then I just like
stipple this on my cheeks and I really
love how this looks I do this before I
apply any powder product so I do this
before I set my under eye concealer and
I love the dewy glow it is beautiful I
just hate how much I have to build it up
I'm on the lookout for a dupe for this
it doesn't have to be a drugstore Duke I
don't know if I would find a dupe for
this at the drugstore but I'm definitely
on the hunt to find something similar
even at Sephora from a cheaper brand or
a brand at Ulta that's cheaper I don't
know I'm on the hunt for a dupe because
being a soul I really really love it I
think it's so pretty and I think it
would be perfect for summer if you're
not even wearing that much makeup just a
little bit of foundation a little bit of
this on the cheeks and then like out the
door if you want to do like a full
creamy look so yeah it was kind of like
I don't think I'm gonna like this but it
turned out to really like it okay so
during this sale I was watching a lot of
people's recommendations videos and I
was watching Jamie Page beauty's video
I'm sure she recommended these so I
picked them up of course cuz I'm super
frizzy and this is the no frizz
smoothing hair wipes from the brand igk
it's their swipe up hair wipes and
basically I haven't used this yet
obviously first time I open this
basically there's just like a little
wipes I don't want to do now my hair's
in a bun and I'm about to wash it but
you just rip this open and then you just
swipe the sheet over your hair wherever
you want some added smoothness and shine
so I mean we're excited to try these out
I feel like this would be great to
travel with keep talking about traveling
I'm sorry I am a very frizzy gal I have
curly hair and it's just naturally
frizzy all the time so I'm really
excited to try these
we finna try those so I have been
wanting this actually for a long time
but I'm waiting for the sail to pick it
up because mama don't eat anymore
browsers and I know that I know I'm
pretty bronzed out at this point but I
have heard so many people like so many
people say that this is their favorite
bronzer for years this is a very famous
bronzer okay this is the Guerlain
terracotta bronzer it's the bronzing
powder natural and long-lasting tan and
I got the shade 0-1 brunettes but this
is the one I got I know is a little bit
warmer than I'm used to I kind of like
in neutral bronzers this one is a bit
warm but I loved it when I got in the
mail I was like oh gosh I'm not gonna
like this gonna look like too light and
warm a little strange and I did not like
the fact that this is scented this
smells like this smells like what I
pictured my grandmother's bathroom to
smell like in 1976 I'm just not into
this super overly powdery perfume scent
in my product especially because
fragrance II things kind of break me out
I've been using this for a while now I
purchased these things before I left to
Canada and then I took this with me to
Canada and be using this bronzer a lot
and so far I haven't noticed any
breakouts but I despise when there's
fragrance in my makeup products but
anyway what I'm wearing on my skin right
now I don't really picture myself
wearing this like in the winter but for
spring and summer it's so warm and
delicious and I feel like it kind of
makes me look like I have a tan I've
kind of been rotating this one and the
it cosmetics bye bye pours one I've been
loving them both at the moment the
cosmetics one is just a little bit
shimmery err but this one still gives me
that warm terracotta glow even though
it's not Sheree okay another thing for
frizzy friends out there I got the
living proof instant D freezer no deep
freezer D freezer it says for softness
and shine
anytime get smooth between shampoos it's
just a you know anti frizz spray sprayed
on your hair kind of finger comb your
hair and it kind of D frizz is a bit and
I agree just a little bit of this
throughout your hair kind of like on the
top and around here it really does help
with your frizziness yeah I mean so far
so good I kept it here it didn't travel
with this or anything but I think it's
doing the job I think it's deferring I
picked these
and I was so intrigued by this and
honestly it does not show up on camera
the way it does in person you cannot see
the neon on camera at all these are from
the brand incredible like incredible
incredible and these are called the
listen hard girl real neon lip paints
these are these are only ten dollars at
Sephora
these are really weird they're cut
they're like lip creams but really
insane neon lip creams like you I'm
telling you it does not translate on
camera at all
so watching them is pointless or you're
looking at the swatches like oh look no
no no they're super super neon and I
thought I was gonna like the orange one
a lot more than the pink one because I'm
an orange lip gal but the orange one is
so streaky on its own at least when you
do like one layer you see right through
it it's so patchy and the only way you
get kind of like an even application is
if you - if you do two layers but once
you do two layers it gets so crusty and
weird I do not like two layers so a
little goes a very long way with this
product I would say the best way to
apply and to get like full jnanis is
with a lip brush because throughout the
day I find that it fades really nicely
it kind of leaves your lips with a stain
I'm kind of like on the fence with these
the pink one is really cool and a lot
less patchy but I'm gonna try these out
with a lip liner underneath maybe adding
a lip liner will really help with the
patchiness and also I don't I'm still
working with these something I did not
like dog hair on my lip this is the
Josie Maran arvin moonstone glow stick
it's the multi-use poor smoothing
hydration snake no I personally do not
like this it's kind of like you know I
feel like this is a very popular product
these days milk has one milk make up
that one is really really nice perfect
to cover up your pores this one is weird
because it has a duochrome color to it
and I knew that going in but I thought I
was gonna be more of like a champagne
pearl color but this color moonstone has
a pink undertone it has like a strong
pink shift to it
so when I'm done applying this to my
face my face looks red like it looks red
and irritated and yes after it sinks
the skin like my face is gonna look that
red anymore but I still have that pink
look to the skin and it just looks weird
in my opinion and I don't see a
difference when I apply my foundation on
top anyway so to me it's kind of like a
pointless product whether I use it or
not I don't see a difference so to me
it's not worth it like I don't like this
okay so I got a couple things at Ulta I
really just wanted to show you guys but
freaking lemonade crazy
palette I got this is new from
Maybelline and I think this is the
cutest palette Maybelline has ever done
like look how cute it says lemonade
create like I love the aesthetic I love
it this is actually the eyeshadow
palette I'm wearing on my eyes right now
and I really really like it but there's
a but I know unfortunately there's a lot
let me talk about the pros really quick
I love this packaging I love how smooth
these eyeshadows are they're very very
soft and they are incredibly easy to
blend if you have an issue blending
eyeshadows where things look patchy
these will not look patchy like these
eyeshadows will never look patchy they
have a very powdery dusty formula which
makes it kind of like so easy to blend
and so easy to work with if you're a
beginner you will you'll just get a
perfect blend every time that being said
this does not last on the eyes by the
end of the day I noticed that my eye
makeup is pretty much gone and I find
that the only way I can make this work
is if I use a super amazing tacky primer
so as long as you're using a really good
base that's gonna make your eyeshadow
stick to it you should be fine I'm just
so used to going in with concealer and
using that as a primer and I usually
don't have any issues but I guess
because the eyeshadows are so so so soft
they do fade a little bit quicker so
just keep that in mind if you want to
try this palette out use an amazing
eyeshadow primer
okay so something I do really really
like got these um uLTA Beauty mineral
blushes this one is in the shade Tiger
Lily and this one is kala Lily are they
all lilies
this one is a very shimmery nudish kind
of blush and then this one is a more
like mid-tone pinky color these are
really good they have a super nice
formula to them very buttery very smooth
they don't look patchy on the skin at
all and they're very cheap blushes that
this
Tiger Lily is my favorite it makes your
cheeks look so glowy in it's incredible
this is the perfect blush for spring
like perfect if you have like kind of
like my skin tone it just makes the
apples of the cheek look so glowy and
healthy with a little pinky flush it's
gorgeous I love it and then the last
product I want to talk about sadly I
don't love okay so I got the Mac gently
off wipes plus micellar water like
that's what they're called
gently off wipes plus micellar water I
don't know these are okay I'm not gonna
say these suck because I've definitely
tried other these wipes that I hate but
and I don't hate these like they're okay
I just wish they were a little bit more
like watery like I don't know the simple
micellar ones these that are empty I
used last one today those are very wet
and they do feel like you're just
rubbing water on your skin I don't know
they're amazing this felt a little soapy
like there was some bubbles to this and
they do take off makeup really well but
they leave my skin feeling a little
strange exact completes this video these
were products I just recently picked up
on Sephora and Ulta and they've been
testing it now and yeah definitely let
me know what you picked up at the
Sephora sale I actually haven't spoken
to you guys about the sale since I've
been back what did you guys buy I'm
dying to know them down below
alright also because also has like an
amazing deal I think they have like 20%
off the other day and the point system
at Ulta is 50 trillion million times
better than the point system at Sephora
but that completes this video guys thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
although that one is like
but but this is excuse me I'm a little
sake this is what I traveled with not
ideal for travel date what English
