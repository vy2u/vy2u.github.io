a vib vib Rouge recommendations video
I've actually never done a video like
this before on my channel ever I always
do VIP hauls every time there's another
vib sale I always do a haul for you guys
but I thought for today I would tell you
guys everything I recommend if you are
looking to splurge with this VIP haul
now if you guys don't know Sephora
doesn't have many sales ever there's
only two a year and it's always around
the fall time and around the spring time
the only weird thing is in the fall time
you get 20% off and in the spring time
you only get 15% off I wish it was both
20 I get that so I've been getting so
many questions like hey what do you
recommend I get I really want to splurge
on some good stuff I want to take
advantage of the sale what should I get
what should I get so I thought I would
sit down and film this video for you
guys and these are still things I would
recommend in the fall as well maybe
you'll skip this sale and wait for the
fall one so you can save 20%
regardless you can take my
recommendations now or later in the fall
just come back to this video but I
really wanted to make it a point to
focus on products I think are worth
splurging on so these are very pricey
items this whole video screams dessa
spensive but if you're gonna buy them
might as well save some money on it
right I don't wanna waste too much time
on each product so I'm really gonna try
to brace through these okay so if you're
looking to splurge on skincare there are
two brands I think are very much worth
the splurge and that is tatcha and drunk
elephant these are my two Holy Grail
skin care brands but they're both very
very very very pricey brands like
vaporize there are so many torture
products that really blow me away this
being probably the main touch' product I
love this is the essence I've spoken
about this in the past but it just makes
my skin feel amazing else will love the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist not
everything works for me but the majority
of their stuff does and same goes for
drunk elephant I mean this is such a
great brand all natural does the most
amazing things to my skin and if you've
been looking to splurge on a luxury face
oil the marula face oil is the way to go
this is such a pricey oil one of my most
expensive oils in my collection but
honestly I see such a huge difference
when I use
it hydrates but then it smooths out my
texture as well
I love marula oil period I also really
love their a TLC so carry baby facial oh
did I mention this this is their TLC
night serum it's amazing for your
texture and this is also a great face
mask for texture as well I just freaking
love drunk elephant so much another
product that I did splurge on myself and
I've never regretted it I've never
looked back
the foreo is so amazing this is what I
use to clean my skin every single night
and morning I'll just apply my face wash
onto this you press this button it
vibrates
I lost my charger so yeah I need to give
another charger I don't even know if
they sell that separately but I'm not
buying a whole entire new foreo so if
that's the case I'll pretend to vibrate
with my hand but this is the one for
sensitive skin and it just deep cleans
my skin without breaking me out or
irritating my skin I do not like the
Clarisonic and yes I've tried the
Clarisonic with the sensitive brush head
there's even like an ultra sensitive
brush head or something did not work for
me
the foreo sensitive is the way to go in
my opinion so I know Sunday Riley is a
big hit and a lot of people like their
good jeans and I forgot the other names
of other stuff and they're a great brand
they're just very very pricey but I did
want to give a huge shout out to the UFO
ultra clarifying face oil because when I
was really really breaking out this
helped me so much it's one of my
favorite skincare products and it's my
favorite Sunday Riley product it's not
the most popular Sunday round product
but it's definitely my favorite I love
this house they like acid in here it
just does a great job of clearing up my
skin a little ghost a Betty buddy long
wait so you guys have to see this coming
right you guys know what I wanna talk
about now
take a wild guess perfumes okay listen
when it comes to vib sale you need to
take advantage of those expensive ass
perfumes this is Flowerbomb the biggest
bottle the 3.4 fluid ounce bottle this
one this cost 164 dollars excuse me star
165 I mean yes granted you don't have to
get this size but I do think it's worth
it you only need a couple spritz and it
will last you a very very long time
especially if you're getting a 50% off
this is one of my most expensive
perfumes in my collection but I go back
to a time mint
again this smells so unique and
beautiful and floral has a little bit of
a sweet powdery scent but not like
powder like I don't explain it it just
smells absolutely amazing and when it
comes to the sale this is the first
perfume I thought of Viktor and Rolf
perfumes in general are amazing because
I have Bambang which is another Viktor
and Rolf perfume this one is a little
bit sweeter I get compliments every
single time I wear this perfume and the
bottle is amazing I love this guy I'm
like almost done I'm halfway through
this also lasts a super long time on the
body just like flower bomb I mean you're
smelling it for hours which is why I do
think it's worth it because that guy's
head that's expensive and this size is
also 165 dollars which is crazy but the
longevity is always worth it for me and
then another bad boy that's also very
pricy it's not as pricy as Victor off
believe it or not but it's totally worth
the splurge because it lasts forever on
your skin and if you've been looking for
a spring fragrance that's really gonna
take you through the night let's give us
some amazing look no further than chanel
Coco Mademoiselle it's such a beautiful
spring scent
it's a beautiful always scent in my
opinion but it lasts an eternity on the
skin and you just smell so sexy and
beautiful I love it okay so now we can
jump into makeup related products I have
a few eyeshadow palettes to share with
you guys actually he was surprised how
many I showed about its if you've been
wanting to splurge on an eyeshadow
palette like I'm talking about splurge
on a real real juicy one one day you're
gonna be like I'm so glad I splurged on
this these are so amazing and honestly
the price is ridiculous I know they are
they are so worth it the looks you get
out of this are so beautiful and they're
just so creamy and smooth these are
probably the best eyeshadows I've ever
used in my life these are the Natasha -
no no shadows but specifically the
sunset palette and the Lila Pilate the
Lila palette I
about a million times ready with the
tropic palate is also the same price but
I keep hearing horrible reviews about
the tropic palate supposedly and
Natasha's gonna change her formula so I
cannot vouch for that palate I don't
know why she would ever change your
formula like I don't get it but these
these are so amazing if you're into warm
colors you will love the sunset palette
it's full of just its most beautiful
sunset i shadow 'z and if you're more
into the purples and the warm purples
and the pinkies and you will really like
this one as well I'm not much of a
purple eyeshadow wear but I really
really love the Lila palette and I
always look at the price of this they're
like a hundred and thirty dogs that's
crazy that's so much freakin money if
you've been thinking about splurging on
these now is the time or maybe wait till
fall but pick them up during a sale but
I do realize those are ridiculously
priced even with the sale so I have
three of my favorite Natasha Turner
palettes that I so think are worth the
money they're the little ones that look
like this they're called the eyeshadow
palette fives and these three are my
favorite these have that same buttery
amazing formula and they're a great way
to try a Natasha - no no I shadows
without spending over a hundred dollars
I mean granted these are each 48 dollars
which is crazy and it's like got a
little plastic thing but I think if they
are worth it I don't know what it is
about these they last forever on my eyes
they never fade and they just they just
blend like a drink they're the best so
she has quite a few but I would
recommend palette number 13 I also
really love this guy this is kind of
like a mini sunset palette without being
the mini sunset palette and this option
when I came out with like a mini so if I
was like this big this one is kind of
like a mini sunset palette it's not that
warm but it has those coppers Browns
those warm shadows this one is number
four pilot number four and it is
beautiful I'm wearing this color all
over my lid it's like the champagne
shade you see and then I also have a
little bit of this on my outer corners I
also have a little bit of this on my
inner corners as well if you are looking
for a unique one I'm obsessed with this
one I've only used it a
all the times because I never really
wear silvery greens but every time I use
this I am blown away by this palette
those other colors you can get them in a
lot of other palettes but I find that I
don't have any other eyeshadows in my
collection that look like this it's
amazing this is the number 9 palette and
you have your like topi Silver's and
your green I love this palette I have
more palettes
I know it's good I see but you know I
mean - are expensive the busy art vies
art I've never really known I've never
learned how to say this these palettes
are amazing they're as good as everybody
says they are these two are my favorites
I personally don't feel the need to
purchase any of the other ones they just
seem a little boring to me I know I know
it's a little mean but they do seem
pretty boring this is pretty boring but
it's a necessity palette it's so
everyday basics you'll never not use
this kind of palette you have every
eyeshadow you will ever need under the
Sun and it's great to travel with I mean
the packaging is a little bit like mmm
plasticky and like why are you $80 oh
yeah did I mention these are $80 that's
a lot for just one palette but they
blend like a dream and you have all your
mats your neutrals all the colors you're
ever gonna need because you have a black
and a very light color and then
everything in between
and I also freaking love this one this
has like deep rich jewel tone colors
without being like shimmery beautiful
deep earthy colourful shades that just
looks so flattering and they're very
wearable because they are a little bit
deeper this palette is amazing I'm
always dipping into this okay so my last
palette I'm including this because I
think it's very pricey for what it is
because I don't use it all the time I
don't use it that often but I still
think it's worth the money that is the
Urban Decay moondust palette feel like
it's not talked about enough I mean I I
don't talk about it enough it's so
awesome but I can see why people aren't
so quick to use it I mean it's just a
bunch of moons si shadows if you're
familiar with the Urban Decay moon dust
shadows they come in like little singles
you can use them wet or dry if you use
them dry they just give you a little bit
of sparkle but if you use them wet they
look insane on the lids I love them both
ways and you look at this and you're
like $49 for a stupid little shimmer
shades but no they're so unique they're
not just
Maree eyeshadows they're like glittery
and fun and I'll always pull this out
from time to time if I'm ever looking at
myself and I'm like this lip needs a
little more Sparkle I just dip my little
finger into one of these and pop it on
the lid I actually have lithium on my
lid right now I only put it on right
here I just want a little bit of sparkle
right here and I think it just changed
the look and made it look so sparkly all
right so now I'm only talking to a
specific group of people out there all
you people with extremely dry skin I'm
talking Sahara desert skin pay attention
to this part listen up if you've been on
the hunt for a primer that just does not
hydrate enough I'm talking about you've
tried every primer Under the Sun nothing
seems to hydrate the skin you need this
in your life and I know it's so
expensive but if you suffer from
extremely dry skin or like those dry
patches
you know when foundation clings on to
like the driest areas of your face it
looks a hot mess this this this fixes it
this is the hourglass number 28 primer
serum it's hydrating it's anti-aging
it's amazing and I know you're looking
at me right now like Kathleen 65 is
dollars for a primer you're crazy I know
it's insane but they do sell a smaller
version it's a travel size for $22 so if
you want to check it out it's like this
break for $22 but still it's better than
65 every time I come across someone who
has like ridiculously dry skin and they
tell me their foundations just look like
crap on their skin I always tell them
have you tried that hourglass serum
primer thing cuz I would transform the
foundation you put on top I don't wear
it that often on camera just because I
have like this like guilty conscience
and it's so pricey but I save this for
those days where I'm like what's gonna
fix this speaking of hourglass the
hourglass fantastic foundations
holy crap if you haven't tried these the
VMB sale is the time to try it
I know $46 is a lot of money for a
foundation but this looks amazing in
photos it applies like a dream it's so
smooth and never looks cakey and it
never lets me down plus it's such an
easy application it's a foundation stick
it's just a lot of money considering you
don't even get one entire like full
ounce it's so pricy but I keep going
back to this foundation and time and
time again
have like a million foundations in my
collection and I use this one a lot so
that has to tell you something I totally
think it's worth the money another
foundation I so think is worth the money
it's the foundation I'm wearing right
now this is the Giorgio Armani power
fabric long wear high coverage
foundation it has SPF 25 whenever I have
a very long event I will wear this it's
that special occasion foundation like I
don't wear it unless I need that
flawless long wearing look and I don't
need that every day so I don't use this
that often but whenever Mama's in need
this comes through for me I love this I
would recommend this for those of you
with normal to oily skin but if you have
dry skin like me if you hydrate really
well then I think this looks really nice
if you've been wanting to splurge on a
foundation for the sale those two are
major recommendations but of course I
always recommend you get a sample before
you buy anything that's áfourá one brush
I want to recommend during the sale
because it's a pricey brush but this is
my ride-or-die stippling brush I know
you guys have seen me use this in
tutorials but I never really talked
about it this is the makeup forever
122 straight and wavy brush it's the
best stippling brush in the world it's
the softest stippling brush I've ever
freakin used there's just something
about this it's so flimsy but like in a
really good way and the bristles are so
soft I use this to bronze I'm even use
this to contour I use this to apply
blush I use this to powder my face it's
one of those brushes that for me was
definitely worth the investment because
I use it for so many different things so
I'm so glad I purchased it and even use
this little end to like mix up my
foundation because it comes to like a
point I don't know I love this brush if
all my brushes disappeared this is one
of the first ones I would go and
repurchase okay I have to talk about
hourglass again I have to this is
limited edition but I checked on Sephora
and it's still available so if you can
get it during the sale oh my gosh you
freaking me this in your life if you
guys like highlights that don't
emphasize texture highlights that just
make you look glowy from within this is
the hourglass ambient metallic strobe
lighting palette and these are three
highlighters they're way more intense
than their ambient lighting powders like
those are very very natural these are
more intense but as natural as intense
can get or as intense as
chucking it what one of my most used
highlighter pilots ever this is in
second place after my Norris bonk
disable highlighter palette that was
limited-edition and is no longer
available this is as good as it's gonna
get this is as close as you're gonna get
you know what all ambient lighting
blanks are worth the splurge in my
opinion they just look great on the skin
and their bronzers are beautiful your
bronzer will never look muddy or just
gross when you use an average last
bronzer my favorite is the luminous
bronze light and even though this is a
pricy bronzer the application and the
way that it looks on the skin is so
worth it so I know I don't talk about
this on camera all that often and I
honestly keep it as like a collector's
item I only wear it on special occasions
I'm that kind of person I know but this
is the Dior nude and Luminizer and this
is in the shade 0:01 this was limited
edition and and it went away for a while
but then it came back and I think now
it's permanent I think it had like a
really high demand but it is gorgeous I
don't know if you can tell like in
certain lights it looks a little pink
but then it does look kind of gold it's
the most beautiful champagne reflect
ever that's what I have right here the
tops of my cheekbones and if you apply
this to your entire face and then you
set your face with like setting spray
you look like a goddess
such a pricey highlight but the formula
and the texture is beautiful okay so
these are the best freaking eyeliners at
Sephora you need them in your life right
now like right right right now I like
the matte ones more than the shimmery
ones but I am wearing a shimmery one on
my waterline today and it's amazing
these are the Marc Jacobs
Highliner gel crayons you get the matte
gel crayons and the regular Joe crayons
these are so creamy buttery smooth
easiest application in the world it's
just like soup right on the waterline it
always looks extremely pigmented like
full-on color and the best part is it
lasts all day on your waterline
I mean honestly these are the best
eyeliners I've ever used I love them
that much and I know they're pricey for
an eyeline you're like still want to
splurge on that you should I know I know
but it's worth it and take advantage of
the sale because I feel like you'd be
blown away by those eyeliners and then
the last product I want to talk about
are the cover effects
some enhancer drops either the
highlighters or the bronzer this is the
best liquid bronzer I've ever used
but these cover effects like drops are
so so pricey but have you been looking
to splurge how many times I said splurge
in this video this is so worth it mine
is all like dingy and busted because
I've used so much of this the color is
right and I love this and when I run out
of it I'm totally gonna purchase another
one because I so think it's worth the
money okay guys that completes this
video these weren't my vib sale
recommendations but I would love to know
what you're planning on picking up
during the sale I would also love to
know your recommendations is there
anything that I don't have that you love
that's worth the splurge like I would
