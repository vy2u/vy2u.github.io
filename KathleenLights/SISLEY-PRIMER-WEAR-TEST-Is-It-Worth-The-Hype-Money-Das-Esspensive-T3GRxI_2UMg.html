have been wanting to do for a really
really long time now and it is a true
wear test I want to put this product to
the ultimate test this is from a brand
called Sicily which is a ridiculously
expensive brand I get it so far past
decimas that's not even a spent that's a
heart attack that's about it
and they sell this at Nordstrom this is
where I purchased this and this is a
double tensor instant and long-term and
it's a moisturizing gel at least that's
what it says on Nordstrom but it has
been going all over YouTube sort of but
people use it as a face primer right
before your makeup and supposedly this
is like the best primer in the entire
world I have heard I think I heard Jack
McConnell talk about it but I've mainly
heard nikkietutorials rave about this
everyone uses this as a primer and
everyone says it's like the best smells
amazing primer ever and it supposedly
makes your makeup last all freakin day
like no jokes but here's the thing
here's it sit down - no I mean you're
probably already sitting down are you
watching this YouTube video standing up
so weird huh unless you're like watching
dishes and watching YouTube that
actually does how I watch a lot of my
YouTube I want a lot of YouTube standing
up that still has a sticker anyway what
I was saying is here's the thing
this is 192 dollars you thought I was
gonna stop by 100 you know almost two
hundred dollars for this product I mean
you put taxes on it and shipping this is
like a two hundred dollar primer no Shea
Syndicate stores I love her she is a
makeup goddess she is an extremely
talented and I watch on her videos I
love her but the first time I heard her
talk about this and I looked it up and I
saw the price I was like what and I know
Cicely is an extremely luxurious brand
so obviously it's going to come with a
high price tag and Cicely is very known
for their skincare
it's mainly used by a lot of mature
women and it's highly raved about so I
don't want to take anything away from
that I was just shocked at the price I
don't know how this could possibly be
worth the money because I have a lot of
primers that prolong the wear of my
makeup that aren't even half the price
of it so while I would normally never
buy a primer like this I have a youtube
channel where I like to test
things out for you guys oh I hate these
little things I know they're to hang
your clothes up but like my contract
right so maybe some of you guys were
just as curious as me so when you
thought circling around the internet
because I have heard a lot about this
recently I have never tried this on my
face before and I gotta be honest I'm
kinda excited I'm going to go into a
little bit more detail on this product
based off of the Nordstrom website it
says it's a fresh gel with second skin
like lifting and priming effects it's
for anyone who wants immediate and
long-term lifting and firming results it
has oat seed extract that's supposed to
create a continuous stretchy and
flexible 3d mesh on the skin surface and
it has lemon extracts that are supposed
to tone and a combination of plant-based
ingredients and tiger nut and cottonseed
extracts strengthens a dermal structure
yeah that sounds like a lot of promises
in a little bottle which is probably why
it's priced so high I'm going to be
doing half of my face with this primer
and I was going to leave the other half
blank but I never put on foundation
without the primer so I thought that
wasn't going to be a fair test so I
looked at on my primer collection and I
picked this out this to me is the
closest thing I could think of to this
even though I haven't tried this yet
this is the amani perfect 10 primer
serum nikkietutorials had mentioned in
her video that this kind of gets tacky
to the touch like when you put it on
your entire face it kind of gets sticky
which helps all the makeup just stick to
your skin and that's why it lasts all
day but I find that to be the case with
this I've talked about this in the past
before on my channel but it's an
excellent primer I got this at Target
and this isn't a drugstore brand this
primer is $34 so it is much pricier than
drugstore primer but it's nowhere near
no the price of the Sicily one so I
thought this would be a good comparison
because if my makeup looks exactly the
same on this side at the end of the day
that you're full let's go in with the
Sicily primer I'm going to prime this
center my face mmm I don't know how much
I'm supposed to put it I had a feeling
this was going to have a really strong
scent and it kind of does it how to you
have a specific scent and now I cannot
put my finger on it but this smells like
something my grandmother used to wear or
used to have takes me back somewhere I
just don't know where
it does feel tacky it's starting to feel
really really sticky on the skin so
that's for show on this side of my face
I'm going to go in with VA imani primer
I'm going to put it on with my other
hand just so we don't get any ideas this
one is not as tacky it's a little bit
more liquidy this one is more of like a
serum but it gets really sticky as well
okay so both primers are on my face this
side of my face is a little bit more
shiny just because the amani one has
that serum consistency and it's a little
bit more hydrating but this one doesn't
feel dry on my skin either it kind of
feels like I'm not wearing anything
anymore although I still feel the
tackiness and I'm going to go in with
foundation I decided to go with the
foundation that didn't claim to be long
wearing just because I really want to
put this primer to the test so I'm going
to take the covergirl vilest healthy
elixir and I am in the shade buff beige
and I also want to use the foundation
because I personally find that it
doesn't really last that long on the
skin and I haven't tried it with either
of these primers so I'm just going to
pump some of that Almagro this is also
going to be a really good test to see if
this is what's breaking me out because I
noticed a little bit of breakouts when
it took this foundation off but I did
use a mask the night before for the
first time so it could have been that
mask I haven't used that mask yet
because I'm skirt
okay so it looks the same on both sides
of my face like the foundation looks the
same I wanted to apply it on camera just
to see if I notice a difference in the
way my foundation applied but nope I am
just going to finish putting on the rest
of my makeup and then I will be right
back okay so I am so sorry I told you
guys I was going to pop on camera after
I did my makeup but that wasn't the case
when I come to do my makeup it was
around like 115 and it is now 338 I did
my makeup and then I went to go have
lunch and I was there talking to Danny
for like a long time and then I was like
oh my gosh
I was in the middle of filming a video
so I came back and Here I am I want to
say I was done with my makeup around
1:30 it's almost four o'clock so I have
had this on for a couple of hours now
obviously it's too soon to tell but I
didn't want to pop on here and let you
guys know I didn't put on a setting
spray just so we can really really put
this to the test so I will be back at
the end of the night and I will give you
guys my final thoughts I will leave in
the description box what makeup I'm
wearing right now and we will see how
this primer compares to a much cheaper
primer at the end of the night hey guys
I'm back
it is officially 10:13 p.m. and I've had
this makeup on my face
for about eight to nine hours roughly
and okay let's take a look see here what
do you guys think from your point of
view what do you guys think this is the
side where I use the Sicily primer
that's as much as a car payment and then
this is the side where I use the amani
primer I don't know let me know you guys
in a bit I think both sides look pretty
similar the only thing I will say they
think I see my highlight more on this
side then on this side I think it has
faded more on this side and I noticed
that early on today like halfway
throughout the day I looked in the
mirror and I noticed that this side my
highlight was a little bit more poppin
then this side but besides that I don't
know what do you guys think more
affordable sign crazy crazy Sun I do
think my makeup looks a little better on
this side I have to be honest this side
looks a little bit a little bit more
faded I feel like I see my blush a
little bit
or on this side for sure I think right
I'm not going crazy and the crazier part
is that this foundation doesn't really
last for me I mean it's completely come
off on my chin it's fitted around my
mouth it's not a foundation that lasts
really long but I think it lasted a lot
longer than it did last time and it's
got to be these primers I will say I do
think this primer worked out a little
bit better than this one I think it held
on to my makeup just a little bit better
so does it do what it's supposed to do
yeah I think so even if this one is just
a little bit better I do not think it is
worth that extremely high price tag I
mean I would have been even more upset
if I paid that much money and it didn't
prolong my makeup I mean I'm impressed
I'm impressed with the primer it's a
great primer but is it worth the money I
personally don't think so this is so
crazy guys $200 of crazy I will say
though if you have mature skin and
you're looking for that lifting and
tightening effect then maybe this is for
you I personally didn't notice that but
maybe mature skin really does benefit
from this remember I am only giving you
my personal experience way way too much
money I even think a hundred dollars is
a lot so the fact that is like a hundred
and ninety okay guys so I'm actually
pleasantly surprised I didn't think I
was going to like this but I like it I
do I'm going to continue to use this for
special events and stuff like that but I
will not be repurchasing but yes I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I was so
curious about this product maybe some of
you were to connect nice video thank you
guys so much for watching and please

will see you in my next video bye time
and then I was like oh my gosh
