quickly wanted to come on here and tell
you guys something I wanted to make this
video I'm on my phone but I have been
literally trying to figure this out for
like three days and it's driving me nuts
so I first thought that my youtube
channel was hacked because there was
this it looked like I was commenting
like weird things to people so I'm like
oh my god my China got hacked let me
change my password and then it'll all be
fine then I come to realize that I never
got hacked somebody made a YouTube
channel with my exact name and photo and
I thought I thought that was impossible
like if you try to create a channel with
someone's name it'll tell you like oh
this name was already taken but what
this person did was instead of doing
instead of putting a lowercase L in
Kathleen they put an uppercase I which
an uppercase got an uppercase ion and
lowercase L looks exactly the same so
that's how this person was able to to
put my like exact name it looks exactly
the same
and then copied my same exact YouTube
profile pic so this person is commenting
like atrocious things to people
like telling them that they're like
stupid subscribers that they're gonna
that they're going to delete them
somebody tweeted me on Twitter asking me
why I called them a racist why I called
them a racist I'm like I wouldn't I
would never say that to anybody what are
you talking about and then she like
screenshot of it and showed me so please
please please I'm making this video
please if you see that I reply to you or
you see my comments on my videos from
now on click on the channel like click
on my channel and if it takes you to my
channel my videos then that was me that
was me
responding if it takes you to a random
channel with no videos then that is this
impostor person because if it looks I
mean it looks like the same exact
channel but if you click on this person
kathleenlights with my same picture if
you click on it it takes you to a blank
channel with no videos it has my same
biography and everything this person
went above and beyond to do this they're
writing like stupid stupid mean things
and it's not me and
I've been trying to get a result I
reported it as cyber bullying and
harassment because they're saying really
mean things to my subscribers and then I
also reported it as an impostor
someone who's fake a fake account trying
to be me so actions are being taken but
I'm trying to figure this out as soon as
I can
so please place it I just wanted to make
this video please if you see my comment
and it looks like I would never say that
click on the channel and chances are
that's not me so I just want to make
sure that if you get a weird comment or
a mean comment that's not me I would
never tell you guys anything mean so
just please please bear with me while I
try to figure this out and try and like
help me help me like spread the word
that there's someone with my same name
and picture just being a terrible person
so just want to tell you this guys
there's an impostor on the loose and I'm
trying to figure it out but I would
never say mean things to you I love you
guys thank you so much and let's see if
we can figure this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
