chats I actually just got done filming a
video which is probably why maybe you've
seen this ensemble in another video and
I was actually not going to do anything
else for the rest of the day and I
decided to sit down and talk to you guys
I decided to do cat chats number two
because you guys really seem to like my
other cat chats video wait a minute this
is cat chats number three it did a
two-parter so this is cat Chasse number
three and I told you guys if you wanted
to see a cat chat style video every
single month like once a month and a
bunch of you guys said yes so actually
this month is going to have to catch at
videos September will have to because I
got a lot of questions asking to do a
cat traps video on some anxiety and how
I deal with anxiety kind of like my
anxiety story and I thought about it and
then I wasn't gonna do it and I was like
no it's really really personal I don't
want to cry on camera but then I thought
maybe if I could help at least one
person out there then maybe it is worth
it filming the video even though it is a
more personal video I'm definitely going
to film it for you guys so that will be
going up sometime this month as well but
I need to like think about it and kind
of like gather my thoughts and stuff and
then work up the courage to sit down and
film that video so today I decided to do
a cat chats video and it's gonna be a
very controversial video by the way do
you like my corner this is going to be
my cat's corner from now on this is you
guys never see this anymore you guys
used to see this a lot when I was back
home in Miami but this is kind of behind
me whenever I face the mirror you know
sometimes I film and it's really dark
and I face the mirror like the light
bulbs this is always behind me um but I
decided to kind of switch it up whenever
I do cat chats videos so this is my cat
jets corner do you like it I hope you do
because I want to make this my cat's
corner maybe I'll put up a sign right
here this says can't chance corner I'm
gonna pay my nails that's why this is
sitting here so today
is going to be all about sponsored
videos what I think about sponsored
videos a dark cloud that hovers over the
worst sponsor and how much people hate
it and I'm going to talk about it we're
gonna I'm going to share my thoughts so
I have been watching YouTube for a
really really long time since I was in
high school not that I was in high
school a long time ago but since I was
like a sophomore in high school so I've
been watching YouTube for a long time
I've been watching YouTube before it
became like YouTube when there was only
a few girls doing Beauty videos on
YouTube like I remember the first ones I
saw were mischievous still to the state
can't say her name
mischievous mischief get by Tiffany D
and Emily Noel I remember seeing them a
few years back before it really got
introduced to the whole giant world of
beauty so I have been on YouTube for a
long time not me personally but been
watching videos for a while and even
before I started as this destructing and
even before I started making YouTube
videos myself sponsored videos never
ever bothered me now before everyone
gets upset let me explain why I kind of
assumed that everyone is being sincere
in their video so if they're talking
about John Frieda Frizz Ease that's the
first thing that just popped into my
mind by the way if someone is talking
about John Frieda Frizz Ease and it is a
sponsored video and John Frieda is
sponsoring that video I'm gonna really
believe that they really like John
Frieda Frizz Ease because they're using
it in the video you know and I know that
not everyone is like that I know that
some people do sponsored videos just to
do it just for the money he just you
know for the brand deal for whatever
reason and it kind of ruined it for
everyone else because I have seen people
do sponsored videos like friends of mine
who really genuinely believe in the
product that they are being sponsored
for whatever and they get so much hate
for it people really go batshit crazy in
the comments section about sponsor
videos and I and I understand I agree I
agree with you guys to a certain extent
let me give you my opinion I feel like
I'm not voicing it correctly let me see
understand where people are coming from
I understand that you get frustrated
when seeing a video and it's sponsored
and seeing another video for an insane
person and it's sponsored and then
seeing another one and it's sponsored
it's frustrating it's like do did you
forget why you started YouTube in the
first place and when I started YouTube
videos I didn't expect to have the
followers I have or anything like that
I honestly started YouTube because I was
bored at my house honestly and I really
really loves makeup and I felt like I
could talk to a few people and just kind
of like become friends with people on
the internet that was really my
intention and my goal I never thought I
would have over 200,000 subscribers and
it's crazy so I really understand the
more subscribers you get the more
companies try to reach out to you so
when someone on my feed does a sponsored
video I'm like oh cool
her video is sponsored I'll watch it and
that's it I'll move on with my life do
you not I mean
I don't sit there and like try to attack
this person for having a sponsored video
I just don't think it's nice I don't
think that people should be attacked for
sponsored videos now on another hand I
think that people doing YouTube videos
need to be smarter because at the end of
the day the people that are watching
your YouTube videos are the people that
are important like my subscribers are
what's important I never want to
disappoint my subscribers and that's
just me that's just the kind of person I
am
so when I see a certain youtuber do
things that are dumb it upsets me like
for example there is somebody I watch on
YouTube every other video is a sponsored
video so this person will put up like a
regular video and then the next five
will be sponsored and then a regular
video and then the next five will be
sponsored and I'm like well of course
people are gonna attack you in the
comments you know I'm really against
cyber bullying and whenever you comment
something like oh my god this is so
pathetic this is so effing annoying wow
what the hell a lot
you're hurting somebody's feelings at
the end of the day and you're being a
cyber bully I don't care what anybody
tells me so I don't condone that but
when you put up a sponsored video every
single day I mean you you get what's
coming to you you really really do it's
common sense of course people are going
to be upset because the old you the
who used to do videos for fun and used
to talk about products you loved
genuinely and stuff like that but that
person is gone so I understand I totally
understand like can one of your videos
not be sponsored please I get it
but I see absolutely nothing wrong with
someone having a sponsored video like
once or twice a month you know if one of
their videos is sponsored in the month
or if two of their videos is sponsored
in the month and they're still putting
out original content and they're still
working really hard and doing favorites
videos and reviews genuine reviews and
makeup tutorials and stuff like that
then I don't see why that person should
be attacked I don't get it certain
people do this for a living a lot of
people have jobs aside from YouTube but
a lot of people do this for a living so
when a brand comes up to them and gives
them the opportunity to do a sponsor
video on their YouTube channel they're
going to take it now I agree with that
if you genuinely love the product for
example I have gotten emails lots of
emails from companies asking to do
sponsored asking to do sponsorships and
they'll send me the product and I'll try
it and I'll hate it
that is that has happened to me more
than three times I like I absolutely
hate this and they'll email me like okay
what are we doing this video when are we
going to be when is this sponsoring
video happening and I have written back
listen this product didn't work for me I
don't feel comfortable talking about
this to my viewers that's just on me I'm
not fake I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do
it no it's not what they want to hear
but I don't care and then I'll usually
just say oh I'm sorry it didn't work for
me would you like me to send this back
and they'll usually respond with no it's
okay keep it because they're a little
bit upset which I don't care if I upset
a company I'm sorry I don't care if I do
not love what I'm talking about I'm not
gonna talk about it I'm sorry that's
just me so I automatically assume that
everybody on YouTube is the same way and
I know that that's not true like
sometimes you'll watch a video that's
sponsored and you know this person
really well because you've been watching
their videos since the beginning and
then they're using like a primer and
let's just say they're using a makeup
primer that they used to say that they
hate and yet they're like I love this
primary works so well on your life girl
you used to hate that primer who you
trying to fool I definitely understand
where you're coming from with that um
but I just wanted to come on here and
say like what are you what do you guys
think I'm perfectly fine with seeing a
sponsored video every once in a while
from someone but I agree with you like
really do three videos out of every five
have to be sponsored that's pretty
ridiculous to me because at the end of
the day your viewers should be your
friends I feel like people should have
more respect for their viewers than that
because for example I put out three
videos a week I try my best to put out a
video Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays I
try my best and I will film and edit
even when I feel bad like that is my
goal this is my job this is what I do
okay I have to film edit and post and I
try to write back to all of you and you
guys are really nice about it you guys
are always like oh my god you write back
to so many people that's so sweet I try
to write back to a lot of you on my
videos because I really do care about
you guys and I feel like you guys are my
friends and I've gotten so many nice
letters and you guys are nice so I never
want to a lot of you are nice some of
you are a little mean and I feel like
people should take their subscribers
into consideration so I don't think that
all their videos should be sponsored
personally but do I think a sponsored
video every once in a while is okay yes
because you know we're all human and
it's okay as long as you believe in the
product I have to I have to make that
very clear I just wanted to ask you guys
you agree with me do you think every so
often a sponsored video is okay as long
as they're being sincere and as long as
they're putting out other content that
isn't sponsored a lot more frequently
than sponsored content did that make
sense no I just wanted to talk about
this because I feel like it's that dark
cloud that surrounds YouTube also
because I have really been trying
something out that I actually really
like and that actually has been working
for me and I'm almost afraid to talk
about it because I don't want to get any
hate or any like on my channel because
it's something that I feel like
everybody talks about but it really has
been working for me and I
almost mad that it has been working for
me you know I'm almost mad I wish I
would have hated it but actually really
liked it so I mean I'll go more into
details in an upcoming video about that
but I just wanted to tell you guys I
hope you guys support me through my
journey on YouTube and I hope you guys
stay stay liking my videos and stay
liking my content I just want to let you
know no matter what happens you know on
YouTube like if I ever hit like a
million subscribers or five hundred
thousand which seems it seems like a
stretch I'm million I feel like very few
people hit a million I think I don't
know but if that ever happens to me I
hope you guys are so supporting me um
throughout it all and don't think and
don't ever think that I will ever become
fake or ever not be me anymore because
no one is gonna make me not be me no one
is ever going to make me talk about a
product that I don't want to talk about
and that's what I think people don't
understand you wouldn't have to do
sponsored videos if they don't want to
they really don't have to no one is
going to make me talk about a product
that I know it doesn't work or doesn't
work for me no one no one okay I'm a
strong believer in being true to myself
on YouTube
I tell Danny this all the time like I
don't care what any company has to say
if I don't like it I do not like it I if
it makes the company feel better I just
won't talk about it at all I won't sit
there and bash your company I'll just
won't talk about it but I will not
praise a company or I want to praise a
product that I don't think deserves to
be praised if any of my videos I've ever
sponsored in the future it's because I
genuinely believe in that product I want
you guys to know that I will always be
true to who I am because that's just how
I was raised
and that's just the kind of person I am
you can ask any of my friends I'm weird
and I'm loud and I'm annoying but that's
who I am and that's the kind of person I
will continue to be and no one can try
and sway my decisions or alter my
beliefs and I want you guys to know that
I get such good feedback on my videos
from you guys daily and I hope you
continue to support me and love me even
if I have 3,000 100 billion million
subscribers or if I have 200,000 do you
get me I hope you get me and honestly I
want to talk about sponsor videos
because I feel like no
talks about the elephant in the YouTube
room sponsored videos oh and another
thing guys just because I get sent a
product to review like if a company
sends me a product to review and I
reviewed on my channel doesn't mean that
the video is sponsored like I don't
think people realize that some companies
just send people like youtubers products
so that they could feature them in their
videos if they like them or so that they
can review them they don't pay them
doesn't mean they're affiliated with
them you know some put so I'm companies
just send products for them to test out
does not mean their videos are sponsored
whatsoever I got a question on what was
it on the LA girl glaze the lip paints
because LA girls sent me their new lip
paints and I did a whole lip swatch
video and someone was like hey this is
faster and I was like no so yeah leave a
comment down below what you think are
you guys okay with seeing a sponsored
video every once in a while
agree with me that youtubers should put
out original content in between there so
in between their sponsored videos and
not only do sponsored video because
that's kind of a slap in the face to the
rest of us so I don't mind a sponsored
video but give me a non sponsor video -
yeah no I also tell me if you like my
cat chats corner tell me if you like
this or not
I just want cat chats to have like its
own little thing so that's why I don't
want to sit in front of Big Bertha over
there that's what I call her Big Bertha
I hope you guys liked this video or I
mean I don't know I'm just sitting here
talking out of my butt right now
honestly
and if you are looking forward to my
anxiety video that should be up soon
sometime this month thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you have a
great great day thank you for all the
support I get on a daily basis I cannot
