a fashion haul I haven't done one of
these videos in a long time I know and I
want to do these more often it's just I
never really buy in bulk like this like
clothes life
I usually just scroll through forever 21
or other online shopping stores and if I
see a couple things I like I'll buy it
but I never buy a lot of things at one
but I thought I would sit down and film
a fashion haul since I haven't done one
in a while and again if my camera goes
down my tripod is broken and my tripod
has not come in the mail yet I don't
know what's taking so long
I have to check my order but anyway I am
going to go ahead and get started I
purchased a few things from forever21
agassi Free People and a couple of
things from Nordstrom so that's what we
are dealing with today
I have shoes clothes and accessories to
talk about ok so I saw this bag by the
way I bought everything online and I got
everything not too long ago so most
likely everything is still on the
website and if it is I will link
everything down below if it's not linked
down below maybe it's not on the website
anymore for some reason or another my
doll is saying I saw this bag on forever
21 and I fell in love with it it is a
super electric chartreuse color and it's
so neon that you can't even see the
color in its full potential in the
viewfinder it is so loud I thought this
would be perfect to take with me to the
pool or something like that I don't have
a beach bag I personally don't like the
material of this though it's like a foam
not a foam but I don't know how to
describe this Dayna
but it feels almost like spongy and I
would think this would get dirty really
easily like in the sand if you take it
to the beach or were like it might get
stained easily so that part kind of
thrown me off but I like it anyway I
think it's really cute and it even comes
with a bag inside it's a pretty large
bag and you could just throw like your
makeup in here whatever I got the cutest
little sandals at forever 21 look at
these these are so cute they're very
springy in my opinion but still very
summery at the same time I love them and
I mainly love them for the colors I love
the green and I love how all these
colors just pair with it so well and I
love these little tassel things and for
summer I don't like to buy pricey
sandals because if I'm going to
or anything like that like I just I
shall probably get messed up I'm a
savage I throw things everywhere and
forever21 sandals do not last very long
they're not the best quality but they're
super affordable I got the Sula tube top
is that what this is called I'm not sure
but I have been looking everywhere for
something like this I just wanted a
simple little black tube top or white or
brown I only found this one in this
color I want them in all colors if you
have any recommendations let me know
because I love throwing these on in the
summer with a pair of ripped jeans or a
pair of shorts they're just so
comfortable and you're not burning hot
in these because there's no sleeves it's
literally just like this piece fabric
and that is perfect for me in Miami
because it is so freakin hot here I need
that I need I need to breathe in the
summer so as some of you may know I
dress mainly for comfort that is number
one and then I dress for fashion but I
cannot be in something uncomfortable no
matter how cute it looks if you can't
doesn't matter anything exciting but I
got this really comfortable shirt at
forever 21 it's kind of like a muscle
tee it comes down pretty low and
sometimes I hate that because it does
tend to show my bra but I'll just put on
a bandeau for things like that this is
right up my alley I wear things like
this all the time I just throw on a pair
of jeans and a comfy top and I'm good to
go and this one's good because it's
comfy and casual yeah it's not a graphic
tee which is mainly what I'm in all the
time so this is a nice little change and
I mainly bought it because I didn't have
sleeves let's be honest speaking of
graphic tees I had to get this also from
forever 21 it has come to a point in my
life where I will buy any shirt that has
Pink Floyd on it no matter what it looks
like I will buy that shirt it's funny
because it kind of started off as like a
little game this is my dad's favorite
brand of all time he is so ridiculously
obsessed with pig Florida I can't every
time I go to his house we talked about
David Gilmore Roger Waters like I know
everything about this ban and I barely
even listen to them just kidding I want
to wear band tee if I didn't listen to
the band I know that's a rule but I'm
not like is a huge fan my dad is but it
started off as a joke one day I wore a
Pink Floyd shirt to his house once and I
bought it because he reminded me of him
and he was like oh my gosh so excited
that I had a Pink Floyd shirt on that
now like every time I see a Pink Floyd
sure I just have to buy it I have to
there was a comment one of my recent
videos to do a t-shirt collection of
like all my favorite t-shirt and even
had a bunch of thumbs up which is funny
to me
but I have so many graphic tees and so
many of them are Pink Floyd so I got
this shirt and it has a little cutouts
on the shoulders and it is baggy I got
this in a size small I wish it would
have been a little bit smaller so keep
that in mind if you're Pink Floyd fan
and you're looking at the shirt mmm what
is your favorite Pink Floyd song if you
are a Pink Floyd fan my dad's favorite
song is um keep talking which is one of
their weirder songs honestly I don't
know why he likes it so much but he
plays it for me almost every time that
I'm out of those I know the whole song
my favorite is shine on you crazy
diamond not that anybody asked me but
just in case there are Pink Floyd fans
out there anyway okay let's move on to a
different store I bought a few things
off of Free People and I really really
love that brand I love free people but a
lot of their clothes is this pants all
right dazzl cents and my entire life
I've shopped that forever 21 it's what I
know
so sometimes the price difference is a
little shocking but you can tell the
difference in quality none of their
clothes have ever ripped on me or broken
on me or like a button popped off that's
never happened to me those three people
and it happens to me all the time with
forever 21 I mean you get what you pay
for and I picked up this really
comfortable casual also shoulder black
tops and it has these little buttons all
the way down and I think it's so cute it
did throw me off at first because the
bottom is like flowy so I thought it was
going to make me look a little boxy and
not going to like kind of does but I
just love how comfortable it is and how
soft the material is I don't know I just
really really do like this shirt and I
think with the right jeans or the right
pants that this would look really cute
like with chokers and I don't know I
really love off-the-shoulder tops
another not so exciting but really comfy
tank is this one this is also from Free
People I purchased this one in pink
because I wanted it for my friend
Melissa's gender-reveal it was like
outside in the barbecue and it was
really hot so I had to wear something
like this so I got it in pink and I just
loved it so much it was it's so
comfortable that I went back and got it
in this really beautiful green shade the
back does have dislike triangle dip so
just be aware of that
when I wore it to the gender-reveal I
did wear a band oh I wore like a white
band oh and you kind of saw it peeking
through but I thought it looked really
cute and I also saw a few people wearing
it the opposite way like I saw people
wearing this as the front even
the tag is here I've seen people wear
this shirt with like a really cute bra
showing and this like really pretty dip
so I mean you could wear either way
because the line is going down on this
side and the line is also going down on
this side so who's to tell you what the
front is I personally like to wear this
one tied at the waist I even did that
for my pink one I just find that when
you wear it loose it does look a little
bit boxy because the bottom is a little
bit wider so I just like to tie it on my
waist I like that look a little better
oh I forgot to show you this one when I
was talking about forever 21 it's a
really cute Olive jumpsuit and it was
only I still have the tag it was only
seventeen ninety but I'm a little bit
iffy about this one because I don't
think I look good in it everything from
her to me one fits me extremely long I'm
around five one so I'm pretty short and
firm so anyone does not carry a petite
section on their website which I always
have to go and get my stuff tailored
which I mean sucks but whatever what can
I do but it's not because it's long
because everything is long I just feel
like this fits my body weird I don't
know if it's because my torso is kind of
short I know a part of me really likes
it but a part of me kind of doesn't let
me know your opinion down below how do
you think does this make me look a
little strange by the way it's been
raining all day the weather has been
terrible here the past few days so if
the lighting is off the Sun is like in
and out let's move on
my sister discovered the cutest little
boutique it is called Valley huh hey
Donna calm I will have a dumbbell oh the
other day my sister was actually like in
this boutique I'm not sure it was just a
little local boutique but I purchased my
things online she went into the store
and she showed me these pants like she
took a picture of herself wearing me
pants and I was like oh my gosh I need
those pants right now so I bought them
online look at these pants aren't these
the most beautiful pants
I love wide leg pants I think they're so
classy and you could pair them with so
many things like a little crop top
little flowy tops
I love wide leg pants so much and these
are so summery they're very nautical
looking to me these are of course too
long for me I do have to get them
tailored but I like the way they fit
when my sister tried them on she told me
they ran big so I did get an extra small
and these fit me pretty good on the
waist this would pair so well with a
really cute top and really like six
chunky gold accessories I loved it so
much that I even bought the same pair of
pants in blue only these have lights
I will admit I think the red ones are
nicer but these are really nautical too
and they love anything nautical my
favorite color is red but they're both
beautiful I love those pants and then I
also got this jumpsuit which when I
tried it on I didn't notice that I could
adjust the straps so in the clip I will
show you it looks a little tight on me
now that I know that you can adjust it I
think this jumpsuit is fabulous I love
this so much is from the same boutique
you can't tell here but it's a navy blue
jumpsuit and has these really cute
cutouts on the side and it does like a
crisscross strappy thing here towards
the neck and I love the style of this
because it goes right up under your
armpits kind of and it covers your
little chi chi's you know everybody has
these little T's here when you wear a
strapless outfit those Chi Chi's kind of
like fold over it's normal we all have
it and this goes right up under armpits
if it covers your chi chi's which I
really really appreciate I think it fits
really nicely it's not too baggy
sometimes I find with jumpsuits because
I am so short that I will get that like
diaper look at the bottom but I think it
fits really nicely this would look
stunning it was like a red lip like this
with your hair like picked up in a
really high sleek bun yeah and then the
last thing I got from that really cute
little boutique was this top and I
bought this to wear like at the beach
over my bathing suits it's just a really
basic red pinstripe button-down that's
really baggy and kind of beachy I love
tops like this or shirts like this that
are baggy and like Paynter II I could
just picture somebody painting on a
canvas and wearing this in a movie
because only people paint like that in
movies but I love this little thing I
totally see myself worrying that a lot
oh I also picked up some jewellery from
that boutique I got these earrings they
have a few different colors but I love
dark green and I love dark blue so I
went with these I'm not one to wear like
really colorful jewelry but I do love
anything jewel tone and I love both of
them I think they're really cute they're
small enough to where they don't really
clash with anything you're wearing but
yet they're the perfect size to wear you
can actually see them on your ear you
know you can actually see the color so I
really like these and then I also picked
up these from that boutique they're just
like the little dangly earrings and I
don't really wear earrings like this
anymore but these just reminded me of
like old-school Magic City a show
something from the 40s I don't know old
school earring
and I love anything old-school and I
just like the combination of this like
aqua color with the gold I think it's
really really beautiful oh and the only
other jewelry I bought I forgot to
mention it earlier when I was showing
forever21 stuff I have been looking for
a gold choker like this forever I have a
ton of gold chokers but a lot of them
look kind of cheap I get most of my
chokers at forever 21 but this one kind
of looks a little bit more expense a
little classier not as bulky it's a
really pretty like flat gold choker and
I think it's so stunning it looks a
little pricier than it is which I really
like so I got that I got it on a
jumpsuit this is from Agassi and Agassi
is like a really similar store to
forever 21 I love elephants they're my
favorite animal and even though I don't
like wearing clothes with like a bunch
of elephants on it I thought that this
had just the right amount of elephants I
absolutely fell in love with this little
outfit because it comes with the padding
right here on the boobs so you don't
have to wear a bra with it and you also
don't have to wear like nipple covers
with it because a lot of the jumpsuits
when I can't wear a bra with them I'll
just put like the nipple cover thing on
it but this comes with padding which I
absolutely love
but I have a little hole right here and
then you just tie it here around the
boob and I just think it's so nice I'm
still wearing my bra in the clip I don't
know why I didn't take it off to show
you but I left my bra on but this is
perfect for summer I just think it's
really really cute and then these these
are a little bit more elegant I got it
in black and in white because I fell so
in love with this at first I got it in
white but I loved it so much that I went
back and got it in black this is a
two-piece jumpsuit from Agassi I posted
about this on Instagram I'll show you
the picture I'm wearing the white one on
Instagram I mean it's not a full body
shot but I am wearing the white one and
it is called the Kendall jumpsuit it's
definitely one of those outfits that you
will draw attention to yourself just
because the lace detailing I just look
so pretty just I really really love this
little outfit I highly recommend it and
a lot of the times those pants fit me
weird on the waist but that one doesn't
and then the last place I want to show
you is Nordstrom and I only picked up
three things at Nordstrom I got this
leather jacket and I know that this is
kind of like a summer haul but last time
I was in Vegas I went out one night and
I wore my favorite jacket it was from
Topshop it was like a faux leather
jacket it was so
- I love this and I accidentally left it
at the place I was at I even called
lost-and-found but it was nowhere to be
found so I have been on the hunt ever
since for a really nice leather jacket
that wasn't too boxy or wasn't too like
motorcycle looking and I found this one
I feel like it's just enough it is
awesome it's a faux leather jacket from
Nordstrom it's from the brand blank NYC
I don't I don't know that brand but I do
love this jacket and it actually looks
very similar to the one I had from
Topshop so I'm so happy I have this in
my life because I miss my leather
jackets so badly my arms don't feel
trapped in this I feel like I can move
and wiggle around it's a very
comfortable jacket and I really really
love it don't forgot this shirt from
Nordstrom
it's a pink floyd shirt in the boys
department so i got an extra large
because like i said if i see a pink
floyd shirt i'm gonna buy it and then
the last thing i picked up are a pair of
shoes and these are the cutest little
cute
this is from a brand called saludos i've
never heard of this brand before but i
saw this on the north stern website and
i just coded a bow fee there are these
blue little flats that have flamingos on
them two different little flamingos and
i think that is so cute flamingos just
remind me of Miami and remind me of
summer so I thought this would be the
cutest little pair of shoes ever and
they're comfortable I like them but
you're done that completes this video oh
I also got this from forever 21 from my
make up videos they're not very summery
but it just kind of like reminded me of
like dangerous woman ariana grande you
know I thought I would get them anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this fashion haul

these in the future that completes this
video thank you guys so much for
