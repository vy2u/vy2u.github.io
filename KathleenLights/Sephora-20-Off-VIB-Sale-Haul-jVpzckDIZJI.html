my Sephora vib sale ha so it's actually
really late what time it is
10:55 on Sunday night damn near midnight
and there's video that's supposed to go
up tomorrow as you guys know I post
Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays but I
haven't been home all weekend so I
didn't get a chance to film this earlier
and I just have a feeling I'm getting
sick like it's that time of the year
where everyone around me is sick and
it's starting to rub off so I decided to
film this really quick before I went to
bed I am so tired but I knew I needed to
get this video up as soon as possible
because I'm pretty sure the vib sale is
like almost over I think it ends today
actually and it has been so requested to
do a haul if you don't know about the
vib sale basically twice a year it's
always like in November and in the
spring Sephora will give you like 20%
off if you are a VIP member before I get
the comments yes I go a little bit
overboard I go a little bit ham at the
vib sale but you know support never
gives you 20% off why not go ham
actually spent hours watching everyone's
vib sale video a couple days ago that I
placed another order and bought more
things so if you want to see a part two
even though the sale is over like if you
want to see another Sephora huh yeah let
me know if not I'm sure this is you know
I got this this is from dr. Dennis gross
and it is their Pro facial steamer I
have had my eye on this for a little bit
ever since I first saw it but it is such
a pricey product that I never wanted to
take the plunge but you know what that's
what it was enough I grabbed it and it's
pretty much exactly what you think it is
it's just a facial steamer I wanted to
buy this for those days where I like to
do like an at-home spa I'll take a bath
I'll put on a face mask I'll do like the
whole thing and I always loved giving
myself really nice facials and I mean
you totally don't need to buy this to
steam your face because all you have to
do is boil some water stand over the pot
and steam your face that way it says
step 1 clean your face pat dry step to
fill the water tank with distilled water
turn on device and steam for 9 minutes
and then choose your alphabet up heel
followed by dr. Dennis crow skincare
serum blah blah use your own skincare I
also got my sister-in-law one
this is what it looks like weird to go
over to going on and off pretty simple
I'm excited I'm excited I don't feel old
so I bought a moisturizer this is the
Peter Thomas Roth glycolic acid 10%
moisturizer fragrance free
non-irritating h a formula with
antioxidant vitamin E vitamin A for all
skin types this had really good reviews
on the sephora website and i was just in
the mood for a new moisturizer as you
know I've been having some skin issues
if I had a dollar for every time I said
that I feel like what I am currently
using isn't working as well as they used
to I'm still very loyal to my drunk
elephant skin care but I was using the
origins night immense moisturizer every
night before bed and I just wanted to
switch it up with something else
so I picked this up and I've used this a
couple of times already and I really
really like it I feel like my bumps are
a little bit smaller in the morning it's
supposed to boost cell turnover and help
diminish fine lines and wrinkles haven't
been using it for that long to tell you
it's amazing or not but so far so good I
will keep you updated I picked up this
product from Kate Somerville this is the
anti back acne clearing motion it has 5%
benzoyl peroxide if I come out of breath
I'm totally getting sick I know I know
I'm getting sick I picked this up
because of makeup by Tiffany D I was
recently watching one of her new videos
or a favorites video and she mentioned
this I don't really love Kate Somerville
products I've tried a few things that I
really like but some things have been
Miz's for me but she mentioned that this
was making such a nice difference on her
skin and I was like okay I'm willing to
try anything
it's supposed to be really good for
clearing out your pores it helps acne
blackheads and even though I don't
suffer from acne recently I have been my
skin is been acting really weird and
it's recommended to use one to three
times a day but it can dry out your skin
so I'm definitely not going to use it
that often I'm going to try to do it
like every other day but I hope to love
it as much as make about seven a day
this is a mask by the brand
derma doctor this is the Kakadu see
amethyst clay detox mask i have the
kakadu with c face wash and i really
really really love it so i wanted to try
out other things from this brand it says
magnesium rich amethyst clay absorbs
Imperia
and detoxifies without removing natural
oils I like to hear that provides gentle
resurfacing exfoliation and helps leave
skin feeling smooth er brighter and
softer sounds good to me I hope I hope I
like this little bit like the face wash
feel I've been feeling like I wanted a
different face oh it's purple it's like
amethyst yeah ah this smells amazing
this smells exactly like the red
starburst oh my gosh
literally cherry starburst oh I can't
wait to put this on my face I will
definitely be updating you on this face
mask you're just supposed to apply it
leave it on for 15 minutes and then
rinse it also is recommended to use
three times a week I'm gonna try to use
it for about a week and then I will let
you know what I think about it but it
smells delicious so I hope it's good and
then this is technically the last skin
care product this is from the brand cope
re and it is their coconut crush scrub I
actually mentioned this in one of my
favorites videos a few months back I had
gone on the Caparo website once to buy
like a shimmery body oil and they sent
this as a sample and I loved it so much
that I had to buy it now during the sale
I love using this right before
self-tanning because it does a really
great job of exfoliating and really
getting rid of the dead skin but it
leaves behind kind of like a moisturize
feeling I wouldn't I wouldn't call it
oily but you feel very very hydrated so
the self tanner goes on really really
nicely on top and like the tanning
mousse doesn't cling on to any of your
dry skin because your skin is just so
moisturized so I love using this before
I tan it's a really really good natural
exfoliator and I highly recommend that I
love it so I've decided that I want to
try out different shampoos I have been
using the same shampoos for a really
really long time now and I just wanted
to switch it up so I got two different
ones for two different reasons this is
the bumble and bumble bee bee Sunday
shampoo this is a clarifying shampoo I
have used a ton that I really like
something that I really really hate but
I'm still on the hunt for like the
perfect clarifying shampoo and this one
had really really good reviews it's
supposed to be a deep weekly cleanser
that really lifts away product build-up
all the styling products that you put in
your hair during the week this shampoo
is supposed to take it right out and
leave your hair feeling
squeaky clean my only hope is that it
doesn't dry out my hair because I have
very very dry hair so I hope that this
doesn't like totally strip it I plan to
use this like once a month so we shall
see how this goes I will definitely
update you on the Sephora app it says
this product is not suitable for
color-treated hair well I guess we'll
just have to see about that and then the
other shampoo I got is the brioche EO
pre ojou how do you say this rose Darko
repair shampoo no sulfates no silicones
or parabens I wanted to really give this
a shot because I am such a big fan of
the rose Arkell milk I use it in my hair
everyday I love that it's so lightweight
and this had really good reviews on the
Sephora app as well it's supposed to
repair your hair and be very hydrating
at the same time so I have very very
high hopes like I'm definitely gonna be
washing my hair with this like tomorrow
I'm so excited if you have tried any of
these shampoos at all leave me a comment
down below and let me know if you like
them or not I have a lot of hair but I
have very very fine hair
superfine very frustrating it gets
tangled so so easily so let me know do
you think I would like these so I have
one more non makeup item and then the
rest of the stuff in this haul is makeup
this video is gonna be long so I had no
intention of buying a perfume during the
sale I have so many perfumes and I need
to focus on using the perfumes that I
already own but I have been using this
rollerball so much that I was like you
know what you gotta buy the perfume you
just gotta buy it and this is a perfume
I've already talked about on my channel
it's from Stella McCartney and it is the
pop perfume this smells like freakin
Barbies I can't except aunt first of all
it looks like a Barbie perfume does it
not like this would totally be a
life-size version of a perfume Barbie
wears tell me no Barbie would rock this
I had got in this perfume in a point
perk at Sephora and immediately when I
smelled it I was like oh my gosh
this smells like Barbies it smells
identical to the plastic little shoes
that you would buy Barbie like if I
close my eyes I could totally picture
myself playing in my room with Teresa
like I really can picture it anything
that could make me feel so nostalgic
about my childhood is worth buying so I
some son of a carnie pop I love the
packaging I love the scent and it lasts
a pretty good time on me it's not like
the most long wearing perfume ever but
like I love it actually I really love it
I picked up two eyeshadow palettes that
I probably wouldn't have picked up if
there wasn't a sale this one is one I
didn't think I wanted I really didn't
think I needed this because it reminded
me too much of the Anastacio Modern
Renaissance palette which is like one of
my favorite palettes of all time so
incredible and this one by huda beauty
just looks so similar so I felt like I
didn't need it but then I thought maybe
I did this is her textured shadows
palette rolls gold edition' take it up
it's this little thing right here and it
has kind of like a Z palette style
packaging I have heard so many mixed
reviews about this palette some people
loved it to death
and some people don't like it at all
some people say the mats are really
creamy some people say the mats are
really chalky like I don't I don't
understand so I decided to pick it up
for myself and I have used it one time
but I'm still not sure how I feel about
it but I love this shade angelic I wore
it all over my lids such a pretty pinky
gold and then the rest of these shadows
are kind of like pressed glitters or
like pressed foiled pigments they don't
pick up well on a brush but it is
recommended that you use these shades
with your finger so that's what I'm
going to do when I try it I haven't
tried these shades yet I just used the
shimmery one and then a lot of the
mattes I have to use it a little bit
more let me know if you have this
palette if you love it if you hate it
leave me a comment I would love to know
your opinion on this palette seriously I
mean and then the other palette I got is
one that I've always wanted to get but
then I was like okay maybe I should but
no it's the vice art or busy art not
sure how that's pronounced it is their
neutral matte palette this is such an
overpriced palette I can't even tell you
how ridiculously priced this stupid low
palette is everyone freaking loves this
palette I don't know anybody who
dislikes it I never thought it was worth
it for me because Sonia Kashuk literally
has a palette that looks just like this
I'm gonna grab it okay so this is the
visor one and this is the Sonia Kashuk
one they're not identical obviously this
one has a good bright orange shade right
there while this has more
like cooler tone Browns but besides that
they're pretty pretty similar and this
one is much much cheaper so I wanted to
buy them to compare them like is it
really worth spending that much money on
this palette or should you just go ahead
and stick to the Sonia Kashuk one I have
been a huge lover of this palette for a
long time you have seen this in many of
my tutorials so we shall see I'm
actually wearing this all over my eyes
today and I really really love it I
think it blended really well so
pigmented and so easy to use they like
blended themselves so I don't know I
might really like it I am so sleepy that
I feel myself falling asleep filming
this video I picked up two powders don't
know why I picked up two but I did this
is the Laura Mercier candle blow shear
perfecting powder I got the shade one
and I also got the shade - I have the
Laura Mercier candle glow foundation and
I really really like it
so I thought that I might like this
powder as well it's a modern pressed
powder that sets perfects and finishes
leaving skin with a diffused subtle
luminous glow this is in the shade
number two which it looks very peachy in
the pan so when I first opened it I was
like oh my gosh that might not be my
color but it sets my foundation really
well I actually think I'm really really
gonna like this it's kind of like the
hourglass ambient lighting powders but I
think that this might be a little bit
thicker I think these powders might have
a little bit more coverage this kind of
is a little bit more concentrated so I
picked up the shade 2 4 all over my face
and I also picked up the shade one which
I like this one the most this one is the
most luminous it's lighter and it has
more of like a pearly finish I used this
one underneath my eyes I didn't use it
to set my under eye concealer but I used
it right on top of the powder I used to
set my under eye concealer and I loved
the glow it gave my face like underneath
my eyes makes your skin look really
beautiful and really really dewy so far
I'm really liking this my opinion can't
change I've only used it a couple of
times I know I just have to see for
those of you wondering I am wearing it
the LA girl Pro coverage HD foundation
in the shade fair and I used the powder
in number two to set the foundation
right on top and I think it is a
really nice combination I am in love
with this foundation guys and it's so
affordable it's so good the rest of the
products are lip products of course coz
I can't stop buying lip stuff I saw this
for the holidays and I could not resist
I had to get me one this is a buxom
full-on lip cream in the color White
Russian which is my favorite lip gloss
of all time White Russian it's seriously
it's my favorite
but look the holiday limited edition one
comes with a little diamonds on the top
how was I not gonna get it I had to get
it why don't you buy your favorite lip
gloss if they made a limited edition one
with a diamond on it I think so as you
know I can't get enough this lip gloss
it's my favorite now have one for here
my beauty room and one one for my purse
it's a win-win I picked up another lip
gloss from the brand Besame I love best
amazed packaging it's so vintage and
like old and classic and I feel like I'm
in a different time when I use makeup
from Besame and this is their sweetheart
glaze luminous lip protectant and
moisturizer aka it's a freaking lip
gloss it's in the shade for10 caramel
and it is a beautiful beautiful just
natural brownie nude perfect for
everyday I do have to say the best I
made lip glosses aren't my all-time
favorite I definitely prefer the buxom
ones way more but I really liked this
color it's such a pretty fall nude you
know so my beauty came out with like an
exclusive limited edition lipstick this
is their amuse-bouche lipstick in the
shade Vampira ly pretty mouth color they
created this shade to help support like
men who have prostate cancer and it's a
really really pretty purple mauve shade
a really pretty rich shade it has a
little mustache on it here in the front
and then the same little stamp on the
back that says 2016 I thought it was
such a cute little thing they partnered
up with the Movember foundation to
support men's health and I'm hoping that
a percentage of like their profit goes
to the foundation I didn't really read
that on the website I was trying to look
to see but I'm assuming that's why they
made this lipstick so of course that was
just more reason to buy it and I love
colors like this anyway especially for
the wintertime I think they're so pretty
and the bite amuse-bouche lipsticks are
one of the best lipsticks I've ever
tried anyway so I recommend
me bite lipstick they're so incredible I
picked up that and then the last two
lipsticks I picked up um I'm not sure
how I feel about them it's so weird
they are the ardency in Monster
long-play supercharged lip colors I have
two shades that have sweet nothing and
Valentine I'm actually wearing sweet
nothing on my lips today underneath the
buxom lip gloss and actually I was also
wearing the caramel lip gloss on top of
this lipstick when the video first
started but these don't last like an
incredibly long time probably faded
since then but anyway I have another
lipstick from ardency in that is really
really good so this kind of threw me off
a little bit this shade and sweet
nothing it's such a beautiful shade but
first of all its oh my gosh this smells
so bad I can't get over how bad this
smells it smells like rotten play-doh
so weird let me see if this one smells
like that okay you see this one doesn't
smell that bad this one in Valentine
smells way less harsh I'm pretty sure I
got a bad one then there's no other
explanation this one in Valentine goes
on a little bit creamier goes on a
little bit smoother really beautiful
color they're very very pigmented but
this shade and sweet nothing although
the color is stunning first of all it
smells pretty bad and second of all it's
very very stiff like when I try to apply
this it kind of skid over my lips it was
a very very dry lipstick but I love the
color so much that you know what I'm
gonna look past that I'm just gonna
throw a gloss on top because it's such a
beautiful peachy nude I don't know it's
like a pickle I'm in with this one I
don't know oh yeah that completes this
video these were all the products i
