do you guys remember when Cornelius
would always hang out on my desk like
when I first started my channel if you
remember this you have been subscribed
for a really long time
Cornelius always used to love jumping on
my desk and sleeping on it when he was
just a little bit younger and now after
getting two more dogs filling in Porter
he like stopped hanging out with us and
he just stays in my bedroom all day and
sleep under the pillows like his life
consists of sleeping on his own in
another room so for some reason today he
wanted to hang out in this room and he
jumps on my lap and got on the table I
was like whoa haven't seen this side of
you in a minute Porter and literally
staring at him like but anyway today's
video is to be a hall and I just
recently uploaded a hall not that long
ago right it was pretty recently where I
uploaded an elf I'm a Sephora haul today
it's a Sephora and an alcohol mainly
support I know guys I don't know I don't
know why I don't need more makeup
I am constantly getting rid of makeup I
give away bags of makeup every month and
I also keep buying makeup I can't stop
so you know before this video is a
thousand years long I'm going to get
started ok so I'm going to start off
with all the things I got it so for us
and most of this stuff is Sephora stuff
and there's actually a few things in
here that I don't remember if I got them
at Ulta or Sephora so yeah aren't you
really mad right now cuz he's sitting
here Porter I left him - that's not fair
that's not fair ok so the first product
I got is this guy and I'm really shocked
that I got out of here than a huge sword
- this is decent for a pro pigment
palette I think in my last and for ha I
spoke about the warm support Pro palette
and I was really liking it here's the
thing these things are almost $70 ok so
I mean they're big palettes and they're
very sturdy they have a huge mirror
they're really wrote this is what this
one looks like this is the colorful one
I forget what it's called
oh the editorial one these don't feel
cheap I will say that they don't look
this mirror I don't think I've seen a
mirror this clear in an eyeshadow
palette in my life
Porter are you joking mmm
the packaging is amazing like seriously
if you're going to travel this is like
the only mirror you need I mean this
isn't a palette I would travel with but
what you get mad at me when it comes to
the warm palette I found that that one
really wasn't worth the money not
because of the quality it was good
quality Porter you're distracting me
it's really good quality it's just I
feel like I can get a very similar look
with a bunch of other palettes you know
I wasn't anything super special is what
I'm getting at so I whatever you $68 for
that palette but I have seen so many
good reviews on this one and I was like
you know what that one is unique enough
for me to spend $68 you know they don't
really have anything in my collection
that's like this so I decided to pick it
up and I cannot wait to play around with
this more they're very very pigmented
I've only watched a few of them I'm
actually wearing a couple of these on my
eyes but like only on my lower lashline
I have something else on my lid and I'll
show you later I have this orange shade
smoked out on the lower lash line like
everywhere and then I have this amazing
dark reddish pink really really close to
the lash line and then I just have this
white shade as my problem so I used
those three shades today but so let's
move so creamy very buttery
whether it's like equals alright so I
got two primers and honestly I don't
know why have so many primers but I can
help myself so I thought a Josie Maran
release this and I love Josie Maran I
love argan oil and the oils I'm Betty
dye which I'm sure you know but just in
case there's any new people out there I
don't say in every video at all but I
have dry skin and this is the Argan moon
stone drop it's a makeup priming and
highlighting oil and it just comes in
like you know the standard argan oil
packaging but it's kind of like a
holographic oil not no not holographic
it's like a double yes it's like a
unicorn opal kind of shift you know what
I'm talking about these things are very
popular these days it comes with this
dropper and I use this yesterday as a
primer before my makeup and it worked I
found it to be extremely hydrating to be
honest it's just argan oil with a little
bit of a sheen so it's like putting
argan oil
the primer and I used to do that all the
time and I would really recommend it for
dry skin but I don't think anybody with
oily skin would like this
at all because it is and always pretty
oily obviously so I don't know I think
it is a little gimmicky for me
personally I don't think it gives enough
of a sheen you know that openness
doesn't really come through once I've
already blended it on my entire face it
just makes me look extremely dewy but I
mean I can use just regular argan oil
for that
marula oil all the other hundred oils I
have I didn't really need this I didn't
see a huge difference to be like wow
totally worth it it's good it's just not
mind blowing I guess as well I'm trying
to say this next primer is from Kiehl's
that's right
Kela that's before oh my friend money
vet tech me like oh my god cube is that
Sephora and I was like what I love heels
they make my holy grail eye cream and I
picked up their micro blur skin
Perfector it has lipo hydroxy acid bark
and lentil extracts it's supposed to be
a lightweight skin smoother to instantly
refine skin texture a lot of skin
texture and minimize the appearance of
pores while improving skins quality over
time that sounds fabulous
I had to pick it up and I used it
underneath my makeup today for the first
time and so far so good I found that it
really did smooth out my skin and yeah I
felt like it really did what it claims
to do the more I use it the more I see
how much I like it but let me know your
thoughts below if you've tried this
because I haven't heard anybody talking
about it so I got this this has a memory
mist from the brand way and it is a heat
protectant and I love this I love this
so much I've only used it once but I
think I really like it so you're
supposed to miss lightly and evenly onto
dry hair prior to blow drying or flat
ironing or you know heat styling to lock
in a smooth blowout or the perfect wave
not only does it protect your hair from
the heat but it gives you hair an
incredible shine shine and long-lasting
memory to any look using a one-of-a-kind
formula the lightweight spray memorizes
your hairs shape and texture until your
next shampoo and I think this is true
because when I did my hair last week I
noticed that it stayed styled a little
bit longer than it usually does
I can only imagine it was this because
it was the only new product I used and
it made my hair soul shiny like it
protected my hair from the heat but it
also made it shiny it was awesome
I don't know this might be my new
favorite heat protectant and there's
something special about this I can't
figure out yet but there's definitely
something special about this and
hopefully I continue to feel the same
way about it because I really really
liked it I got a hair mask
I was recently in LA and playing hair
went to it I never really styled my hair
I'm lying I do I always I in my hair my
hair is naturally curly after ironing my
hair for 15 years straight I've kind of
lost the curl there a little bit but I
heat styled my hair so much like day
after day when I was in LA that whoo
took a toll took a toll on my hair it
was so dry and brittle and I just wanted
a new hair mask my living proof one is
still my absolute favorite but I just
wanted to try something else and this is
from the brand diva curl which I love
this brand whenever I style my hair
naturally curly this is the melt into
moisture mantra butter conditioning mask
it is 100% sulfate paraben and silicone
free which I try to always use hair
products that don't have cellphones
there are a few hair products I use that
have silicone in it but I really love
but for the most part I try to avoid
that and I picked this one up
specifically because it said it was for
people with really really dry hair that
will be me so I wanted to give it a shot
they recommend to leave it on for three
minutes minimum but if you want like
extreme moisture you can leave it on for
15 to 20 minutes in like a little hair
wrap thing and then wash your hair so
I'm really really excited for this one
this is a brand cons thing in both of
their faces right here maybe you think
it is so creepy I'm going to take you
guys up you guys are like William ale
this is a brand called Lee lobby or Lila
B not sure how to say it but I've never
heard of this brand
Sephora is bringing in so many new
brands it's kind of getting me excited
because I feel like I keep seeing the
same brands over and over just the same
thing all the time and seeing new brands
and different products just get me
really excited so when I saw this I was
like I'm
I'm gonna try that okay let me put this
test
Fatima Freddy down if you at all know
relax all right
you better not ask me to get off that
desk you were begging me to get up there
of course okay it may take you up for
the guy so this is the flawless finish
foundation from this brand and guys this
is the craziest packaging in the world
like look at this I don't know how to
enter but this feels like if I'm holding
a brick it is so heavy but this is the
heaviest little powder foundation in the
world and I got mine in the shade be
natural and this very open it like how
cool is that so freakin heavy oh my gosh
and it's like such cool packaging and
it's so small even though it's so heavy
it's so small and I kind of love it just
for this packaging like I kind of want
to keep it in my pocket safe forever as
for the product I used it today for the
first time and I really liked the finish
it kind of gives your face a very
natural satin finish because it has a
slight sheen to it
nothing shimmery but it's almost like a
hydrating power it looks a little sheeny
but like very slightly
I don't know this packaging just blew me
away it's like do you hear that this
feels almost like ceramic that's not
good for me I'm very clumsy okay another
hair product this is from the brand i GT
and honestly all the products I've tried
from this brand are just based on
packaging alone they have the coolest
packaging everything looks totally
different and it's just it's so cool I
love it but this is the expensive Amla
oil high shine topcoat and I believe
that I bought this before the memory
mist because this is awesome of like
rafi protectant it says it's like a top
coat for nails this you'll be protecting
glaze instantly forms to hair creating a
transparent weightless shield that adds
intense color depth and dimension and
prism like shine AHA oil nourishes
strengthens and softens hair after the
wear of color treatment and feels the
cuticles
hair color from fading and damaging from
heat tools leaving your hair looking
expensive ass that's what it says so
what does I keep protecting but
according to this it does a little bit
more than this one does you guys know I
have two smelling okay
it actually doesn't really have a scent
it just smells like conditioner that's
what it smells like
I don't know I feel like this is so easy
you just spray it on and it gives you
nice shine so I don't know I have a
feeling I'm going to like this more or
just reach for this one more because it
is so easy but I am going to give this a
shot oh wait you don't use this as a
heat protectant like right before you
use this in place of conditioner that's
why it smells like conditioner okay so
it says after shampooing work expensive
through your hair a massaging gently
down the cuticle from root to tip leave
on for two to three minutes and then
rinse use one to two times per week in
place of your conditioner up oh my gosh
this is a very hydrating conditioner
that also protects your hair from the
heat that is so weird
alright so excited for that okay last
thing I got from Sephora I believe this
was so expensive you want talking about
a sprint business or sleep this is the
AL Genest
Al Gore onic acid and collagen it's
basically called the genius liquid
collagen and this is a collagen based
formula that's readily available for
youthful vitality let me tell you
something guys I turned 25 and my life
changed I've spoken about it a few times
on my channel but I felt myself become
an adult it was like it happened
overnight and I could just feel my
collagen leaving like I feel it you know
the other day I got in the pool I had
SPF 50 on but I wasn't wearing my hat
and I woke up the next day with a
sunspot like here on my face and I
freaked out my mom has sunspots on her
body and she was like well I mean you're
already 25 so this was expensive but I
feel like skin care products are worth
investing I mean if they work for you
and use it for anti-aging products from
now and the first ingredient in this is
collagen and I had a really good reviews
on Sephora and I open it let me show you
what it is it kind of looks really cool
it has like little yellow bubbles on the
inside of this and when you're applying
it to your face I use it last night for
the very
first time when you're applying it to
your face like you feel the little jelly
bubbles just like dissolve into your
skin and it doesn't feel sticky or
anything it just kind of feels like a
serum and honestly if you've on the
sephora website and you read all the
claims of this product it sounds amazing
so even though it was like the craziest
price I don't know I really wanted to
pick it up anything that's going to help
me maintain my youth that would be nice
even though I'm sure you're watching
this video like you look young I know I
know I know I did
actually the other day I went to a
restaurant and a girl put down a kid's
menu in front of me I'm not kidding this
is the second time this happens to me I
was offended at the same time I was a
little excited I'm not gay but yeah I
bought liquid collagen and hopefully it
works really well I'll keep you guys
updated though I use the rest mine but I
didn't notice a huge difference like
this morning when I looked in the mirror
my skin looked plump and nice but I
didn't notice a huge difference so this
is probably something I'm going to have
to use over time to see a difference and
then I guess I will keep you guys
updated but let me know if any of you
have tried this okay and then the rest
of these products I got at Ulta I got a
foundation this is the bare minerals
bare Pro performance wear liquid
foundation I have SPF 20 I was a little
bit on the fence about buying this
because I had seen my friend Laura
review it and I think she really didn't
like it
this comes with a pump I think she
really didn't like it but then I saw
another review and then they loved it so
I was like girl I don't know if I picked
it up anyway I got the shade warm
natural but this is too light for me
right now
but I did mix it in with another product
I bought it all up and that is the
Catrice prime and fine makeup
transforming drops and I got mine in the
shade darkening kind of just like a
little thing you mix in your foundation
and it's going to darken it they also
have a lightening one I believe it's
just white like a white cream this one
is brown I don't know how I feel about
this I think it's the color that's weird
I don't know if this is like the right
tone to use as a shade dark inner but
this is what it looks like it's just
like like a brown cream but the
undertone is a little bit like reddish
so I feel like and made my foundation
look pinky I don't know I didn't even I
didn't even apply that much I did two
pumps of this on the back of my hand and
then I squeezed some of this and I mix
it all up and it did darken my
foundation so it I mean
I'm wearing it right now and obviously
you can see I darkens it up quite a bit
to match the rest of my body but I feel
like it changed the undertone I don't
know how I feel about this I'm going to
try out with a bunch of different
foundations I have but I'm not sure
about this little brown liquid after
this foundation I only wore for the
first time right now like before I set
out from this video is the first time I
put it on and obviously this probably
made a difference in the finish and the
way it looks on the skin but I think it
looks really nice the coverage was
really good so far so good I have like
really bad smile lines and this one
isn't sinking in too badly it looks good
around my nose and in between my
eyebrows which is my problem area I say
this a hundred times but I have to play
around a little bit more and then I'll
see how I feel about it I got two
eyeshadow palettes one of them is from
NYX and I got really excited when I saw
this I think the concept is really cool
it's the ultimate multi finished shadow
palette and this is what it looks like
on the inside I love how it has like a
purple row a pink copper row a bronze
row and they're like a little ivory row
and I love how they all match but this
row is matte this one is like a shimmer
row and this is a glitter row so I'm
really excited to see how these wear
that's what three piece watch right
there you can't yet but that is really
really gorgeous that looks so shimmery
mix eyeshadows are so hit or miss for me
there's some that I love to death and
there's some darling
Oh hopefully this is one of their good
palettes I can't wait to play with this
on the eyes I have a few different
shades but I got mine in sugar high
that's more me obviously and then I got
this palette that I'm so excited about
this is the ultra beauty palette it's
from the Ulta brand and it is the
Melissa Michele palette it's a collab
with Melissa Michele here on YouTube
this is her pretty little face and this
is the pouch she created and I was so
excited to pick this up mainly because I
love Melissa Michelle and you know
what's weird the first video I ever saw
her was a swap that she did with Nicole
Guerrero
they did like a swap do you remember
those so you remember those swaps people
don't do them anymore but they had a
beauty swap and I was subscribed to
Nicole Guerrero but I hadn't
know who Melissa Michelle was and they
did that swap and I fell in love with
Melissa she was sitting in her closet I
believe filming that video and I
subscribed her and I've loved her ever
since so I'm so happy for her that she
created a pallet this looks so pretty
these colored these are the eyeshadows
and these colors are so neat and then
you get the highlight and the blush and
you even get a matte liquid lipstick and
this color is super beautiful and yeah
the eyeshadow oh this is what I'm
wearing on behind completely forgot to
say that all the eyeshadows I have like
on my lid are from this palette I'm
wearing rosemary in my crease
bing-bang on the outer corners and in my
crease as well and then I have this
gorgeous gorgeous color all over my lid
and that's the entire look I have and I
love it I haven't used any of the other
eyeshadows so I can't tell you if
they're good or not oh I also used
Weezie to set down my eyeshadow primer
but before that I did use I really
really liked them actually used a little
bit of the blush in my crease as well so
yes I can't wait to play with this more
Congrats Melissa and I got this which I
hate I'm going to put this into this
appointing products video it is garbage
at least for me it's garbage doesn't
mean the Scarb are for you if you love
this I'm sorry this is the Tarte lid
lock eye base I was so excited to pick
this up because I have been on the hunt
for a dupe for Mac's painterly paint-pot
or soft ochre and I feel like I have
found dupes in the past but they're
always getting discontinued which is so
weird but I really want a pop just like
painterly and I was like oh my gosh this
is perfect this is in the shade buff it
looks just like soft ochre I hate and
hate is a strong word but I really
really really don't like this it is so
drying like when I applied this to my
lid it looks like a patchy dry it was a
disaster and I was like oh maybe my lids
are just really dry I have very dry skin
so I use it the next day with like eye
cream underneath and it just it just
looks dry on my skin it's not for dry
skin if you have oily eyelids you might
really like this because I feel like it
just sucks the life out of my lids so I
do not like this at all I couldn't blend
eyeshadow on top of it it has to take it
all off and then use a primer that I
really like because this was an oval for
me that's both times that I used to
okay then last but not least I got this
little guy
this is the Catrice million styles lip
topcoat and I got mine in the shade
highlight lips and this is pretty much
just like a shiny shimmery like opal
looking lip copper glossing what I mean
let's say I'm satisfied is to my lips
I'm wearing a point zero right now and
it's a matte liquid lipstick but I want
to see how this looks on top of it
you can't really see the sheen or the
openness to it but it did make them look
just like glossy lips well I could put
them till you really like this since
it's not too intense is probably perfect
to throw on like every week would
lipstick just to give yourself a glossy
finish so so yeah guys that completes
this video this was everything I got
from Sephora and Ulta I hope you guys
enjoyed this video you know the other
day I was looking random sidenote the
other day I was looking through old
boxes and I found this this is Selena we
