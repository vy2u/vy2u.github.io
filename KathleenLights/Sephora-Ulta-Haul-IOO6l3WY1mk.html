a little ha for you guys I tweeted the
other day that I was at Sephora and if
you guys wanted to see what I bought and
a bunch of you guys did by the way
follow me on Twitter if you don't you
should so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started and show you guys everything I
got I also went to old time I got a
couple of things at Ulta so I'm gonna
show you the stuff I got at all so first
so I picked up 4 lip products from Ulta
and they're all NYX products I usually
only go to Ulta to pick up NYX things
because I feel like if I want drugstore
products I might as well just get that
at Target because they're a little bit
cheaper than that Ulta so every 2 for
lip products and they're all like in the
same family don't they look similar
I know I don't I picked up one of their
soft matte lip creams these things are
amazing I have two of them and I love
them I want to pick up like all of them
they're so good I got mine in the shade
Sydney and it is just like a pale pinky
purple reminds me a lot of snob from Mac
like snob lipstick it's just a nice
amazing matte pinky purple like I just
said and I think that this would be
perfect for spring it which is why I
picked it up and I looked I picked up
another butter gloss and this one is in
the color Eclair I love these things and
for some reason I only have creme brulee
don't know why I went specifically for
meringue and now one was sold out so I
picked up Eclair which is what's on my
lips right now and I love these they're
not sticky they're super glossy and they
last all day and they're incredibly
cheap so and then I pick it up
two of their butter lipsticks I was
really excited about these when I found
out they existed and Ulta is pretty far
from me back when I was in Mississippi
like Ulta was right across the street
from my house pretty much but also it's
pretty far from me now so I picked up
two of the butter lipsticks I got
fun-sized which is just like a peachy
nude a really light peachy nude and then
I picked up cotton candy which is a very
very pale like bubblegum pink it's very
very close to cotton candy and I really
really like these the only thing I will
say about these is that you have to like
exfoliate your lips before you apply
these because they
gonna sink into your lines and if you
have like chapped lips and stuff this
will accentuate the crap out of your tap
lips
so definitely moisturize put on like a
chapstick underneath these or anything
like that so that they could look as
nice as they can because they kind of
emphasize the nastiness and also the
packaging is a little bit like cheapy
looking I feel like it's a cheapy
packaging I don't know those are just my
only two complaints but aside from that
I really really love these colors I
think they're so pretty and perfect for
spring I also picked up this Maybelline
master highlight highlighting blush in
the shade nude and I've heard so many
things about these like highlighting
blushes but I had to give it a shot and
I am so impressed that is the blush
slash highlight I have on my face right
now I am not wearing any blush or any
highlight just this one product and I
love it love it love it so much I want
to go pick up coral and all the other
really pretty ones because I think they
are amazing they're super pigmented and
I just think they give you like the most
beautiful glow like I've ever done I'm
feeling it I'm feeling the glow guys I
really love it definitely check these
out they're from Maybelline and I think
they're pretty new so and then the last
thing I picked up at Ulta is the it
cosmetics naturally pretty palette this
is probably the thing that I'm most
excited for out of everything that I
bought I'm so happy that I purchased
this because it is literally perfect
it really is let me read this to you
really quick it says it's with hydrating
aged reverse and prevent conflicts
infused with peptides hydrolyzed
collagen silk antioxidants and drops of
light so basically heaven created this
palette and it is beautiful it has this
like plush packaging reminds me a lot of
The Naked palette the original Naked
palette where it's like a pillow but
it's so beautiful
and these colors are amazing I promise
you that I don't think I've ever seen
such creamy matte shades in my and
my life these are all matte colors but
they feel almost like creams I don't
know how to explain it the pigmentation
is on point and they're not chalky at
all like they're probably the best matte
shadows I've ever come across in my life
like us like even Mac Urban Decay like
these eyeshadows are incredible and I
love that comes with a giant
transforming pearl shade which is
basically like your highlight shade it
does have shimmer and this is supposed
to be like you could layer it on top of
any of these eyeshadows to give it like
a pearly finish but yeah they're all
super pigmented I love every single
thing about this palette and I think you
might become one of my all-time
favorites of life so so amazing and for
so many shadows $42 isn't terrible so
check out the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette because I think you will
love it now I'm gonna show you the
things that I got at Sephora I said I'm
gonna get a bunch of stuff like makeup
stuff I went specifically for a
moisturizer because I needed a new
moisturizer and after doing a lots and
lots of research I decided to go with
the origins high potency NIDA means
mineral-rich renewal cream kind of hurt
my feelings buying this because it is
$40 and I'm used to buying my
moisturizers from the drugstore
none of the moisturizers that I was
using recently we're doing anything good
for my skin my skin has been breaking
out of my forehead like I've been having
some problematic skin so I figured I
needed to do something to my skincare
routine I've changed it up quite a bit I
know you guys want to see an updated
skin care routine but I'm waiting to get
my perfect routine and then I'll show it
to you guys but yeah so I picked up the
origins boys razor and I've heard so
many good things about this
I had like almost 5 stars when I checked
on makeup a leader at Sephora calm and
this says it has resurfacing ingredients
to help remove dry flaky layers to
reveal brighter texture and clarity what
you guys know the issue with my skin is
not so much acne as it is texture and
the dry nasty patches so hopefully this
does good things to my skin
I will update you guys and let you know
I hear good things about origins and I
honestly have never tried anything from
them so hopefully this is a good one
continuing on with skincare I bought a
new face wash I have been using purity
for a really long time now and it is my
ultimate favorite face wash but my
friend mainland insisted that I picked
up the fresh soy face cleanser I have
heard really good things about this
specifically from makeup Ally a lot of
people have said that it's better than
purity some people say that period is
better but I don't know I guess I'll
figure that out it's fragrance free and
pretty sure it's like paraben free it's
like a really gentle cleanser let me see
how this smells oh it smells like
cucumbers kind of it smells like really
cucumber ewwww I don't know I came so
well the smell doesn't bother me so I
also picked up this little duo that was
right at the front of the store next to
the register and it is the tarte
maracuja oil and the maracuja seed
brightener eye treatment these are just
like tiny versions of them but I decided
to pick it up because it was ten dollars
and I think that that's a pretty good
deal this is what this is the size of
the eye cream it's not insanely small
and this is the America's oil which I
haven't tried any of these products
before but I've heard really good things
about the American oil so hopefully I
like them and if I do I will definitely
buy the full size this is so cool this
is a little pump oh my god you just like
press the top and it sucks the product
and you pump it out that is really cool
that blows my mind
that was a blow your mind that blows my
mind okay I picked up the NARS radiant
creamy concealer because I hear one more
person say anything about this I will go
nuts but I've heard so many good things
about this so I hope it's as good as
everyone says I got it in the shade
custard I've heard so many good things
and this better blow my mind because if
not I'm gonna be very upset these little
containers are pretty darn expensive so
yeah I picked it up because it's
my shopping cart online for like three
months and I decided to just go ahead
and pick it up when I was there
yesterday I posted this on Instagram but
I picked out the Urban Decay electric
palette and I am over the moon first of
all look at this packaging oh no this
packaging is unreal you know something
you know it's just it's just my silica
like I just want to look at it all day
my desk insert it cuz packaging is
outrageous but what's even better is
what's inside the palette look at how
crazy these colors are they're like
super intense the mirror is large and in
charge good lord look at the size of
this so I want to blind you but it comes
with a little brush that's actually a
very very good brush super easy to pack
color on with this brush I really love
it so yeah a bunch of you guys said you
wanted to see a review swatches in the
tutorial using this if you want to see a
review with like in-depth swatches and
stuff like that let me know in the
comments below and I'll do that but yeah
that is the Urban Decay electric palette
and let me last two things I got at
Sephora are these hold this I've
assigned Amelia is here and she is
helping me clean up my little Sephora
mess thanks Amelia you're the best so
like I was saying the last two things I
picked up from Sephora where these
little double-ended white lipsticks they
were $12 each which means like $6 a
lipstick they are pretty small but I
wanted to try and eat out first before I
bought a full sized bite lipstick just
because I heard so many good things
about them but I wanted to kind of like
test them out for myself and they're
phenomenal
I love them so much I really really want
to go get I want to go buy a full-sized
versions of these lipsticks because
they're so creamy so pigmented the smell
is really really nice like a really
pleasant scent and oh my god I really
really love the formula they're so nice
this is what they look like they come
like they're just double-ended the
lipsticks are on each side and I just
think they're really cool and practical
you just throw it in your person you
have to
six I don't know I really really like
these this little doe right here comes
with violet and Palomino follow me know
is like a nice intense fuchsia reddish
pink that was a horrible description but
you catch my drift
that one is Palomino and then the really
pretty violet color is called violet and
it is a nice radiant orchid type of
shape and then this one is probably my
favorite one it comes with more neutral
wearable colors this one is in leech
which is a really really light pinky
nude kind of like a mauve a pinky nude
and then this one is in musk which is
just a darker version of that like a
brown kind of nude instead of like a
pinky kind of new so I really really
love these I really want to go pick up
leech that was probably my favorite one
check out the bite Beauty lipsticks
because they're good so does everything
I got at Ulta and Sephora let me know
down below if you have any of these
products and if they're good or not
