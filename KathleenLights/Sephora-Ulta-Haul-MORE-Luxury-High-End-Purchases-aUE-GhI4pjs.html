a Sephora haul actually a Sephora and
Ulta haul actually a Sephora and Ulta
and Nordstrom and Beauty - ha because I
did pick up something from Beauty lish
that they don't sell it at Ulta or
Sephora and same goes for a Nordstrom I
got something that they don't sell and
so for Ulta but they're really two
products so you know there are a lot of
luxury products in this video today
actually recently purchased a ton of
things from the drugstore which then
made me want to go in Sephora and try
out some more high-end products there's
just so many things that I've had my eye
on recently that I've been wanting to
try out so I finally did and and I have
a few recommendations from you guys in
here there's actually like three
products in here you guys recommended
which I'll go into detail as I go on Oh
before I get started I do want to
mention something so you guys know when
I film facing my window you guys don't
really know the setup happening here but
whenever I film tutorials I always film
them facing my window cuz I get better
lighting like that and that's always
right in front of my desk where you see
my computer behind me and like the
frames and stuff and I have my little
message board that I've been putting in
the back of all my videos but all my
recent videos and they say like random
little things in every video and I was
thinking I kind of wanted to do that on
this side as well I was thinking of
taking this off and putting another one
there to have like another little
message board here when I film videos in
front of my vanity because I film a lot
of my videos sitting here and I've just
been loving switching out the board and
writing new little messages I don't know
that might be stupid but I just been
having fun with it so I was wondering do
you guys want me to take this off and
put like another little message board or
should I just keep the be the light you
know what do you think definitely leave
it in the comments below okay I'm gonna
go in no particular order so I want to
show you what I bought off the Beauty
lish website I finally bit the bullet I
feel like I've been wanting this since
the day it released this is the advice
art get on their pro vol.1 grande Grande
whatever this is a pellet that they
recently released and it has 30
eyeshadows in it and this is a very very
pricey palette I've been back and forth
with this guy because when I first saw
it online I was like you know what I'm
not really into the colors that much but
I love Weiser eyeshadows so much like
the warm matte palette is one of my
favorite palettes their stuff is just
really creamy and easy to blend I just
love using visor shadows so I was like
you know what I'm gonna get it and this
is what the palette looks like if I said
it's 30 eyeshadows it's a very pricey
palette so I really want to try this out
really test it out and see if it's worth
the money right off the bat I will say I
hate this I want to rip this off so bad
I'm gonna have to use a scissor I don't
understand palettes with these things I
mean I get it they're trying to do that
so that they don't get this part dirty
or whatnot but I I don't mind getting it
dirty this little plastic thing just for
me cheapens the product and it just it
drives me mad but besides that like I
said the colors weren't really calling
my name but when I saw it in person I
was like oh my gosh yes I really like
the color selection because you pretty
much have everything literally any matte
eyeshadow you hom need these are all
mattes by the way but you have all these
light colors even like like pinks and
blues and then you have these super cool
toned grays and cool toned Browns but
then you have really warm shadows as
well I feel like there's so much variety
in here and you also have these crazy
pops of color so it looks even prettier
in person in my opinion I did use it
today for my eye look the shimmery thing
on my eye is something else but it did
blend really really nicely I only used a
few shades I used some of the Browns but
I really really liked it I don't know if
it's worth the money just yet but so far
so good okay so this next product has a
little bit of a story to it well a few
of these products do these were
recommendations from you guys I tweeted
the other day in pure desperation
because honestly I've been on a little
bit of a struggle bus it's like the
minute I turned 25
I got smile lines I got wrinkles on my
forehead I feel like they were always
there but that's the meaning I hit 25
they like really sunken and now my
foundation just sits in my smile lines
Nora what foundation I'm wearing no
matter what primer I've used I've tried
so many things no matter what I was
using my foundation was just settling
into the lines even when I would set
that area I always set this part it
would just settle right into my smile
lines and it's so crazy cuz Gabby for
like RKL polish photo shoots she
literally has to sit there behind the
camera and like every two minutes just
to go up to my face blend in the
foundation because it just settles
so quickly so deeply it's insane anyway
I tweeted you guys as
if you knew anything that I could put on
my face that would help my foundation
from sinking into my lines and I got a
few recommendations from you guys and
one of them I did have to get at
nordstrom because I didn't sell it at
Sephora or Ulta and that is the Giorgio
Armani day long skin Perfector for your
trouble zones and honestly this was
pricey but the subscriber who tweeted to
me was like this works for me it's
really good try it out so that's what
I'm doing I honestly will try out
anything anything that's gonna help
myself on Dacian from settling until
these damn lines it says it's an
advanced skincare 4 day long makeup glow
instantly pores and shininess look
reduced foundation application is
improved milky emulsion helps absorb
sebum riposte sweat and keep skin
looking fresh all day I will say this is
not a radiant primer like you don't put
this on your face and feel glowy and so
beautiful and do you know they use it
yesterday as my primer I put it all over
my entire face but this almost like
disappears on the skin when you put it
on it sinks right into the skin I did
feel like it really smooths out my skin
I've only used it once so I really have
to give it another shot with different
foundations better play around with this
more and see if this really does make a
difference because it was buddy but I
see but I'm gonna give it a fair shot
and really really test it out and then
another primer you guys recommend it for
me when it came to my smile lines and
like the little ring keys on my forehead
this is the YSL Touche Eclat blur primer
I've been hearing about this for a
really long time and I never wanted to
get it because I have tried out the girl
on primer that looks very very similar
to this comes in a bottle it looks just
like this and it has little gold flakes
in it just like this but I found that
the girl on primer didn't really work
for me and for my skin so I gave that
one to my mom and I just I figured this
would do the exact same thing but there
was actually a couple of you who
recommended it to me and after the
second one I was like fine I'll try it
and I'm wearing it as a primer today and
I really liked it it really smooth out
my skin it kind of gave me like a
barrier between my foundation and my
face and I do feel like my skin looks
really smooth I mean I am using a
different foundation so maybe that's it
but I really like how my foundation of
on top of this primer like I said it was
just a first impression so I really have
to give it a go but so far so good is
hope pricing you guys recommend it but I
see but I see stuff let me tell you and
then this guy this guy I feel like it
has made a difference I'm not even
kidding I've only used this twice this
is the Kiehl's powerful strength line
reducing concentrates clinically
demonstrated to decrease appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles and improve
radiance and texture it has hyaluronic
acid all that good stuff
it does say to use morning and night and
I used it last night for the first time
and when I woke up I don't know if it's
just my mind but I felt like my skin
looked a little bit more stretched like
it didn't look so lying right here and I
just concentrated this on my troubled
areas I put it here around my mouth and
then on my forehead and I feel like I
saw a difference in the morning I don't
know if I'm crazy but I feel like it did
and and I feel like this works as a
primer as well in those certain areas
because the subby who recommended it to
me told me if she puts it on before her
foundation and it kind of just expose
everything perfectly and that's what I
did today
I used the YSL primer but I put this
right here in this area and in this area
and I swear to you like let me zoom in I
could be the foundation I just purchased
a new foundation but I don't think so
let me zoom you it okay usually you guys
have seen it like in my intros of my
tutorials and stuff I have like these
deep smile lines right here and you can
still see it here a little bit but this
one I feel like you can't see it as much
and I feel like it's because I'm wearing
this underneath my foundation right here
my foundation isn't sinking into my
lines as much as it usually does I don't
want to get too excited but hopefully
these products really work for me thank
you to everyone who recommended products
to me I'm gonna keep trying your
recommendations see what works best
thank you guys for always having my back
I freaking love you guys I purchased two
new hair products the first one is a
hairspray this freaking brand gets me
every time for its packaging this is the
igk intern flexible hairspray I thought
I was gonna smell amazing but it doesn't
it smells it smells like regular
hairspray it doesn't smell bad at all
but I thought it was like but no but
supposedly this is a great hairspray
that's not gonna make your hair flake
and I used it today on my hair
usually put hairspray on my curls but I
used it today and I like it's not
crunchy at all like at all I didn't make
my hair feel stiff or anything so I
don't really use hairspray all that
often but I wanted to dowel into a new
one and I loved the packaging on this so
let me know if you've tried it because
I'd love to know your thoughts and then
I saw this and I got really really
excited I work with breo's you and they
send me products all the time but I had
never seen this before and I got too
excited and I just purchased it I'm sure
this is brand new but this is the Brio
don't despair repair strength and
moisture leave-in mass oh my gosh I got
so excited when I saw this because the
don't despair repair hair mask is my
favorite hair mask it's one of my
favorites it's amazing and this is a
leave-in version of that so you just
spray it onto your hair and it's like a
leave in conditioner almost but like a
leave-in mask it's supposed to repair
damage repair split ends it's supposed
to leave your hair really strong soft
and healthy and hydrated so I am so
excited I put it in my hair last night
after I washed it and I'm gonna keep
using this I want to see how this
compares to my Rose Arkell milk because
I used this last night in place of my
rose Oracle milk and I really like it so
far but like I said these are all first
impressions so I don't know if I love it
just yet okay so let's talk about a
product I truly did not like at all
which kind of shocked me because I
purchased it based on all of the great
reviews but this is the lila bead
glisten and glow skin illuminator I keep
trying out this brand this Lila B brand
because I really loved their setting
spray and they're all over face powder
is awesome as well but their eyes shadow
quad I didn't like and this I just don't
like this is a skin illuminator I
thought it was gonna be a powder skin
illuminator but it's not it is a creamy
skin illuminator but this doesn't
illuminate to me this is just shimmery
cream with a little bit of glitter in it
and it's not the little gold specks I
don't like it's the fact that this isn't
very illuminating when I went to apply
this to my face today I put it directly
on top of my foundation with my fingers
I didn't have any powder on my face yet
and this looked awful I started to lift
up the foundation I had underneath
started to get cakey and weird and it
just wasn't illuminating my face at all
it was it was just so
strange I do not like this product at
all maybe if you like a very very very
natural barely-there glow this will be
for you but for me personally it just it
did absolutely okay so I picked up a new
foundation and concealer a new luxury
foundation and concealer both from Kevin
of Kwan and this is the etherealist skin
illuminating foundation and the
etherealists
super natural concealer I'm not even
going to pretend like I didn't buy this
because it was called the super natural
concealer and now it's a stupid reason
to buy a concealer but I saw this
concern and I was like huh super natural
concealer like that's so funny super
natural but I didn't purchase it right
away I kept it in my car and then I saw
someone crap I forgot who mentioned this
in their yearly favorites video and I
was like okay fine I'm gonna try it out
so I did purchase it and I'm wearing it
today and I really really liked it
surprisingly I was kind of shocked that
I liked it so much because to me nothing
holds a candle to Tarte shaped tape
which by the way I completely forgot to
mention my NARS soft matte complete
concealer and my yearly favourites
I used this the majority of the first
half of the year how did I forget to
include that but anyway I love this one
a lot like instantly as I was blending
it out I loved how it looked because it
gives you a nice like matte finish but
it's not too matte it looks very natural
it doesn't look super natural actually
it looks super natural Wow the only
thing is it does crease pretty easily
you do have to set it right away whereas
with shape tape you don't really have to
set it this one definitely needs to be
set but once you set it it just looks so
nice I don't know how it lasted on the
day but I like it so far they've only
been wearing this foundation for about
an hour now but I freaking love this
foundation can I say that already this
really is a skin illuminating foundation
it says it's a moisture packed
lightweight foundation that provides a
luminous airbrushed appearance yes yes
yes yes yes
leaving skin with a naturally radiant
glow there's a silky smooth texture
delivers semi satin medium coverage and
blends effortlessly onto the skin I
agree with this so much I feel like it
is a very illuminating foundation but
it's not wet and dewy looking like it's
illuminating but airbrushed
at the same time your skin looks almost
like perfected but super healthy and
radiant but not too much
I hope this wear is really nicely
throughout the day I got mine in the
shade light I feel like it gave me the
glow in all the right areas I mean I do
have an illuminating setting powder on
top but immediately the second I put
this on as I was blending it out on the
skin I was like yes I love this yes for
me this is an a-plus so far I'm also
really really loving the setting powder
I put on top I got this from Ulta this
is the Laura Geller baked balance and
glow illuminating foundation I got mine
in the shade light I don't think this
should be called an illuminating
foundation because I personally don't
see how anybody would want to wear this
like as a foundation like pack it on as
a foundation because it's very
illuminating it's a very glowy powder I
would call this an illuminating setting
powder but regardless I love this I've
only used it today for the first time
but I feel like I found something I'm
gonna use all the time that I'm really
gonna love I used a different powder
underneath my eyes but then I went in
with this with a very light hand with a
big fluffy brush and just dusted this
all over the face to set down my camera
Daquan foundation and I love it I feel
like this sets down your foundation
without making it matte I'm just like
the perfect amount of luminosity I I
love this powder I picked up the new
Stila shimmering glow liquid eyeshadows
I got a few of them because I'm obsessed
with the Stila
glitter and glow somebody called the
glitter and glow shimmer shadows they're
amazing that just packed with glitter
they look insane I love them so they
just came out with shimmer and glow
shadows which is kind of like the same
concept only they're not as gallery
they're more of like a foiled metallic
finish so I picked up some shades that I
really saw myself using two more unique
shades these are like a purple and a
blue I thought this would look so cool
like in the spring and then I got more
wearable shades the one I'm wearing on
my eyelid today is kid'n that's the one
I really really wanted because kitten is
like the best Stila eyeshadow of all
time it's a total classic and I freaking
love it I applied two layers like right
here on the inner corners and it just
looks so pretty so glowy on the lids
these swatch so nicely I'm gonna be
inserting swatches for you guys but
they're so gorgeous and I only picked up
six shades but there are so many and
they look phenomenal all of them and
stealin
send me some of their collections not
all the time but I didn't receive these
so I just knew I had to get some because
they are gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous I
actually picked up two skin care
products and then the rest are lip
products and then we are done I feel
like we've been here for a million years
but I got these two products let's start
with this taco one I was so intrigued
when I saw this on the Sephora website
this is the deep cleanse from tacha and
it says it has clarifying Japanese
loofah fruit extract and I exactly sure
what that is or what it means but it
says it's an oil-free formula that
cleanses with amino acids without
over-drying leaving skin soft refreshed
uncomfortably hydrated it's supposed to
help unclog pores while clarifying your
skin tighten the skin smooth the skin
fix its texture and it's supposed to do
all of that without over-drying the skin
so I used it last night for the first
time it kind of threw me off a little
bit it has the weirdest texture ever I
guess it's all of the like exfoliating
things in it but it's not little beads I
don't know the consistency on this
product is really weird kind of sticky
and I know that this is targeted for
normal to oily skin but I wanted to pick
this up just to use maybe a couple times
a week to really help clarify the skin
and exfoliate without using like a deep
exfoliator because I do use my dr.
Brandt one and I really love that one
but I just wanted to try out something
else and I really stand by tatcha I feel
like they make products so well they're
very pricy brand but they're a brand
that I think is definitely worth the
money so I'm not sure if this is worth
the money for me but I cannot wait to
use it more and then I picked up this
product because of Nicole Guerrero she's
one of my favorite youtubers I've been
watching her since she had that Rihanna
right here I'm obsessed in the career I
love her so pretty much and this is the
origins out of trouble 10-minute mask to
rescue problem skin she spoke about this
in her yearly favorites and I
immediately picked it up because she was
saying it's like the best mask ever I
haven't used it yet because I was just
trying out so many new things last night
I didn't want to overdo it but this is
supposed to really help your skin it has
super absorbent zinc oxide and sulfur
calming camphor camphor and salicylic
acid which I love salicylic acid but
it's supposed to soak up oily shine
refine rough texture and get rid of pore
clogging dead cells and debris I don't
have any
oiliness or any shine to my face so I'm
a little bit concerned about this
product I hope it doesn't dry out my
skin let me know the of dry skin and if
you use this because I know she has like
normal to oily skin I think so let me
know if you have my skin type and if
this works for you if you have tried it
okay so then the last products I got
were all lip products I got two of the
new Fenty Beauty Matt Moselle plush
matte lipsticks I love the packaging of
these they're like look how cute I
really really love this packaging I got
two colors I got spanked and I got up to
no good up to no good it's like a super
warm peachy nude really really pretty at
first I was like oh is this gonna look
good on me but I think that when I have
a little bit more of a tan it's gonna
look really nice especially in the
summer really really liked it and then I
feel like spanked would look good on so
many different people like so many
undertones so many skin tones this color
is absolutely gorgeous I love it they're
a little bit hard to apply because they
have this little round tip but you can
perfect anything with a lip brush and I
love how small these are you can throw
them in your purse and they feel so
comfortable on the lips they're matte
lipsticks but they don't dry out my lips
at all I really really like this you go
Rihanna good stuff and then I got one of
the buxom Vava
plump shiny liquid lipsticks this is
brand new I've never tried this out
actually I haven't tried this one out
yet but I got the shade feel the passion
lips get all the action with Vivid pout
plumping color with an innovative lip
hugging paddle to precisely deliver one
stroke color for a fully saturated satin
lip shine pact
it's basically a liquefied lipstick that
has a lip plumper in it so I'm really
excited to try this out this is a really
pretty pink hopefully it doesn't hurt my
lips and then the last two products I
got were from Stila these are the stay
all day shimmer liquid lipsticks they're
just like their liquid lipsticks only
these are shimmery version so I got
patina shimmer and a luminaire shimmer
so patina was one of my favorites Tila
liquid lipsticks I feel like when liquid
lipsticks first got on the internet when
people were first discovering them
patina was everyone's favorite liquid
lipstick I would go to my Sephora in
Mississippi and it was always sold out
people loved patina and now they created
a
version it's not too metallic which I
really really like because metallic lips
are not my favorite but I do love a
liquid lipstick that has a nice like
glittery shine to it I think it can look
really pretty and then a luminaire
shimmer tastes gorgeous I love this one
even more than patina shimmer it is
stunning it's like a shimmery nude it
looks so pretty but okay guys so that
completes this video these were all the
products I recently purchased off of
beauty lush and Nordstrom and Sephora
and Ulta and some of these things hurt
my wallet but hopefully they're all
worth the money I cannot wait to play
around with them even more if you've
tried any of these products let me know
how you feel about them in the comments
below
but that completes this video guys thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
I'd like it to keep what with an
innovative lip hopping lip humming with
an in with a no what did I drop
