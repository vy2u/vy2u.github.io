a since flora Hall a very important and
special Sephora haul because it was
recently existed for a vib sale now I
really wanted to do this video
completely different I wanted it to be
like an epic Sephora haul and I wanted
to give you guys vib sale
recommendations like a couple days
before the sale but since I was like on
a youtube break and I was taking some
time for myself I wasn't really focused
on makeup much and I just didn't have
the time to post my recommendation video
it was just a big mess and I know that
by the time I upload this video the
support vib sale is completely over but
I thought better late than never
at least I hope so I hope you guys still
want to see this video and if you want
to see what I purchased during the sale
were about to get into it I will say I
didn't go crazy in the sense that I
bought like a million things but I did
go crazy in the sense that I lost my
mind and I purchased two items I always
said I would never ever ever buy and
really the only reason why I bought them
is because they were on sale and even
then it's crazy we don't save that much
during the vib sale I mean don't get me
wrong if there's a time to buy from
Sephora it's definitely during the sale
because you never get a discount at that
place anyway
but what I mean is it's not like a crazy
discount but it's something and that's
the only reason why I love those
products like I said I didn't buy a ton
of things but the crazy things we're
going to leave the what were you
thinking purchases towards the end that
we're going to breeze through the other
stuff okay so I picked up this kula tan
sunless tan anti-aging face serum
everything about this product spoke to
me it's 70% organic and it has a daily
use gradual tan treatment it says enjoy
a natural looking radiance year-round
with our daily use 70% organic sunless
tan anti-aging face serum a potent blend
of argan oil vitamin C hyaluronic acid
and plant stem cell cultures leave your
skin feeling smooth hydrated and glowing
our streak-free and trends for free
lacks up to three days and is great for
use alone or added to your everyday face
moisturizer and I don't know it just
sounds so promising I'm so excited to
use this and it is so cute I love the
little bottle I haven't tried much from
this brand I'm really excited to try
this I hope I loved it I have one from
the brand Clarins that I swear by I'll
drop that one into my moisturizer at
night and in the morning my face matches
my body if I had the night before it's
amazing but I thought maybe I would like
this one a little bit more I think the
ingredients are better I don't know I'm
just really excited to use this let me
know if you've tried it I know it's
brand new to Sephora but if any of you
guys have picked this up already and I
have tried it let me know how you feel
about it because I'm very very excited
have a little fun I'm very excited I
purchased this hair product from the
brand breo's you and I love this brand I
use so many of their products in my hair
amazing and this is brand new I just
thought on Sephora it is their scalp
revival charcoal and coconut oil micro
exfoliating shampoo doesn't it smell
crazy I have never tried anything like
this in my life
you pretty much just use this like you
would a regular shampoo only you really
have to work it into your scalp and
really massage there so it could
exfoliate and then once you do that you
just rinse it out and use your
conditioner like normal it says it
contains gentle coconut derived
cleansers and the exfoliators are also
vegetable based so that's pretty cool
it's supposed to gently remove the dead
skin and impurities from the scalp and
hair I cannot wait to use this because I
use a lot of dry shampoo so I feel like
mama needs something like this to really
get in there sometimes and I hope I love
it because I love this brand I'm
thinking I might love it I hope so I got
this because of my friend Laura mrs.
Lowell in here on YouTube she was raving
about this and I buy pretty much
everything Laura recommend but she said
this was an amazing self-tanner
I am a huge believer in loving tan that
is my favorite tan in the entire world
in my opinion nothing can beat loving
tan I know it's super overhyped but it's
one of those products that's overhyped
for a reason I have yet to come across
self-tanner I like more than that but
Laura said this one was really good and
it came with a mint which I love the
tart mitts are amazing they're that like
soft velvet texture that really
distributes the chance perfectly I use a
tartness all the time with my loving tan
Tanner a lot of brands make mix like
this by the way but and she mentioned
that this one doesn't really I mean I'm
not going to I was stupid
but Laura said that this one didn't have
a really bad scent that it was really
easy to use and it smells good so I'm so
excited to try this out and I love this
packaging it does I'm going to get to
ridicule summer
because it's getting me the system I
just realized I'm not wearing anything
on my lips I'm going to pop on some lip
gloss this is the book so nothing
careful this is the book some blushing
margarita this gloves you guys know
these are my favorite lip glosses and
this is a limited edition color for Ulta
I know this video is about Sephora but
this color is amazing and you need it if
you like these books and glosses so my
advice to you is to run to Ulta and get
it I bought mine online anyway I bought
another hair product I have been trying
out this brand a lot recently this is
igk and they have the coolest packaging
it's honestly the reason why I've been
trying out their products because I love
their packaging so much and it's so cool
everything has like a cool different
background this one is like a pink silk
bedsheet this is the prenup instant
spray hair mask I was reading about this
on the support website and it just
sounded so interesting so I really
wanted to try it it says inspired by
splash masks I don't even know what a
splash mask is but this is a high
powered in shower treatment that
performs like a traditional hair mask
but works in under a minute
it's supposed to be conditioned repair
and strengthen your hair and it says it
has a 360 spray that gives you a simple
application and coats every hair what
does it mean 360 spray I'm kind of
scared to spit huh I don't know what I
mean it says you should use this at
least once a week if you use Hot Tools
or if your hair is chemically treated
and basically after you shampoo your
hair and you rinse it out and really
rinse out the water you're just supposed
to spray this to your entire head leave
it on for a minute and then just comb it
with your fingers and then rinse it with
cold water and supposedly it's a green
hair mask and I hope it's really good so
yes okay so now we are starting to walk
into la fury territory because it was a
sale I had to stock up on my favorite
makeup wipes in the world these are the
co Shindo cleansing spa waters and I got
the pact that brings three they have
like a really big one but I like the
smaller packs to travel with each little
package comes with ten cloths I love
these they're very pricey for a makeup
wipe so I always go in between these and
my simple my seller ones because over
from the drugstore they're very
affordable fees not so much but I'm
obsessed with these these are so wet
they're very saturated and they get
all of my makeup off and I only have to
use one wife most of the time I have to
use two everything comes off and it
doesn't leave a film on my face it
doesn't strip my skin sometimes I find
that if the wife is just like too wet it
will leave a weird residue on my face
and how does it happen with these just
like literally water that take your
makeup it's amazing
I love these wipes and yeah I have to
restock almost okay and now the rest of
these are ridiculous
purchases so I purchased this honestly I
don't know why I did but I did this is
the Giorgio Armani microsil loose powder
and I got mine in the shade Universal
nude this comes in three different
colors bronze light Universal nude and I
pink one I think and I have to be
completely honest I don't I just don't
really like this demo there's nothing
special about this it is pretty much the
elf under eye setting powder that white
powder that has the little glitters in
it this is pretty much the NARS crystal
powder the loose one it does the exact
same things as those products and this
is 45 bucks so I don't think it's worth
it I didn't think it was gonna have the
little glitters and I don't mind a
little glitter because on my face you
can't really see them that much all that
does is brighten up the under-eye so
when you set your under-eye concealer
with it it gives you like that bright
look I think Kat Von D has one like this
Laura Mercier has one like this there's
just so many other brands that do this
but I don't think you need this Armani
one honestly I just don't even see
myself using this I have so many other
powders I love way way more than this
it's pretty and I like it I'm not saying
it's about product it's a good powder
it's just like not life-changing and
it's just so many other brands that do
the same thing so yeah I bought it but
it's not my favorite I actually think
that I might give this to my mom I think
my mom might like this okay so my next
two purchases please don't judge me okay
I know I'm going to get so much crap in
the comments please and as written
I just I don't know why about me okay
these two products are both from the
same brand
I've never purchased anything from this
brand in my life and I got to be honest
I probably won't purchase anything else
because if I wasn't doing YouTube at all
trust me I would never buy this but I
got two products from Christian
Louboutins
the tendency the guys name but I
purchased this because of makeup by
Tiffany be okay blame makeup by
stephanie be 100% terpil but a purpose
she did an entire video dedicated to
this product and I bought I waited for
the moment that I could use the discount
all for Sephora I purchased the
Christian little is hidden I'm so sorry
for butchering that I cannot speak that
language so my pronunciation sucks but
this is the lash amplifying lacquer this
is a freaking mascara and honestly I'm
keeping the box because I need it to
live in here because I feel like I paid
like 20 dollars for this case alone or
like 30 dollars because this is a $70
mascara let that sink in I mean
obviously look at this packaging this
feels extremely heavy I got mine in the
shade Cole I saw make it by Tiffany's
video like I said and this looked so
crazy on her lashes and she was talking
about how she always gets compliments
people always think she's wearing
falsies when she wears it and I don't
know how I feel about this obviously in
my personal opinion that no offense to
anybody who really loves luxury makeup I
personally don't think this is worth the
money I'm I knew I was never going to
think it was worth the money at $70 and
the benefit roller lash which is
high-end is like $30 which is feet but
not as feet you can get to benefit
roller lash --is and still so I knew
even if it was insane that I wasn't
going to think it was worth the money
but I wanted to see what it could do to
my lashes and I'm wearing it today on my
lashes I'm going to zoom you in I'm
wearing it today on my lashes and I
really wanted you guys see what it looks
like and I want you to tell me what you
think do you look at my lashes and think
oh my gosh I've seen your lashes look
like that a million times
other mascaras have done that to your
lashes I kind of feel that way I kind of
feel like here it looks a little strange
don't get me wrong I think it's good but
because of the price I'm just being
really really picky with it I do think
it makes my lashes look really long I
prefer something a little bit more
volumizing I want my mascara to make my
lashes a little bit thicker I think that
if it dries like in a week it when it
dries a little bit more I think I might
like it a little bit more but yeah what
do you think I mean I don't think it's a
miracle worker I think it definitely
looks
on Tiffany I think it looks awesome on
her lashes but yeah I don't know
obviously I'm going to continue to use
this probably going to be the only
mascara I'm using for a couple of weeks
because I really want to get some use
out of it because I paid an armored leg
for this and you know I don't want it to
sit in my mascara drawer the way all my
other mascaras do so I want to keep here
my vanity I'm going to do this all the
time and I received my opinion changes
and the last product in today's haul is
another like I said another Christian
loosing product and it is a nail polish
yes this is the product I said I would
never ever ever buy in a million years
but here I am holding it in my hand and
I thought that if I ever did buy this I
would get the classic red with the black
stabber here but I didn't I got this one
they came out with like a nudes
collection and I just loved the color of
this so I wanted to get this on a set of
the black one and I got mine in the
shade Sweet Charity which is described
as like a sheer vanilla so I'm assuming
it's not a super opaque nail polish look
how extra is this nail polish do not get
me wrong this is the most beautiful nail
polish bottle I've ever seen like I mean
I mean this has been much but you could
tell you could just tell by looking at
it and feeling it this is luxury but
there's no way this could ever be worth
fifty dollars but that's how much this
is folks squidgy dulles brush is a
little long I do like something a little
bit shorter just because I feel like I
have more control and I prefer kind of
like a fatter brush the wand is not my
favorite but hopefully this lasts long
time on my nails to at least feel good
about it you know but I think this would
look so pretty on like my vanity or
something like that you know I think it
would look nice this blade obviously
that's not why I purchase it by
purchases to try this out to sale makes
me do crazy things
alright so yeah that can leave this
video guys these were all the products I
recently purchased from Sephora because
