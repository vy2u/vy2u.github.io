a Sephora haul for those of you who
don't know these past couple of days the
vib sale was going on which if you're a
beauty insider you get 10% off I believe
and if you're a vib or VIP Rouge you get
15% off I usually go really really
really really really ham during the vib
sales my favorite one is the one in
November because you get 20% off the one
in the spring is 15% and surprisingly
enough today I don't have a lot of
products to show you I just picked up a
few things but some of these things a
couple of these things are expensive so
I'm glad I got to use at least 15% not
much but it's something I think that the
sale is over now I think like yesterday
was the last day I'm not sure I placed
my order online and the coupon code was
like Rouge note or something like that
okay so the first product is the most
expensive thing I bought I have been
wanting to try this for so long but I
just always thought it was completely
overpriced like I didn't understand why
this is so much money this is the foreo
but I bought the Luna 2 and the purple
one which is for sensitive skin this is
200 buckaroos people why I don't
understand why is this so much money but
I was reading the reviews online and I
mean everyone said it was amazing so I
just had to give it a try I'm one of
those people who is kind of against the
Clarisonic I know I know it's like a
cult favorite I just don't find it
necessary my hands and cognac sponges
have been working just fine for me like
I've been able to wash my face for 24
years without using the Clarisonic but
people just say really good things about
this so I'm gonna give it a try this is
why I didn't go ham on this whole
because well this alone I wanted to get
summery products so I picked up these
guys right here this is from the brand
philosophy pure grace summer it's a
shimmering dry body oil and you have to
shake it up like if you leave it alone
see like all the glitter will set and
then the oil will be just left at the
top so you want to make sure you shake
this before you use this I have used
this once and I really really like it it
does leave my skin a little bit I
wouldn't say sticky but I can feel it on
my skin but it does leave
pretty like golden sheen to the skin let
me see you let me show you can you tell
probably not Kato
okay Joe doesn't this arm just look like
Jennifer Lopez's arm
this is Kathleen's arm and this is
Jennifer Lopez I don't know in person
you could definitely tell I love the way
this makes my skin feel like the other
day I wore I wore it to a baby shower it
was at a park I wanted to try it out not
like something you would think to wear
to a baby shower but I did I do want
something just a little bit more intense
so like I want a very delicious golden
II type of product that's similar to
this but I do love this nonetheless and
I really really really like how this
smells this grace scent is delicious
okay so the other summery product I
bought is this this is the Vita Liberata
broad-spectrum SPF 50 I get really
excited when things are SPF 50 for some
strange reason this is also a dry oil
I'm in the market for these kinds of
things
it says passionflower and argan oil so
face hair and body this is the little
packaging I'm really excited to use this
one because it's a dry oil that has SPF
in it which in the summertime like SPF
freak I used to not care before like I
used to like baked in the Sun when I was
like 14 through 18 very very bad those
years why did I do that I don't know but
now I'm like has been it's an SPF or sun
protection in a non-greasy formula
unlike any other oil you've ever tried
gives your skin the most stunning dewy
radiance it says it has free radical
fighting organic argan oil fatty acids
vitamin E passion flower oil and
conditions dry damaged skin and it's
water resistant for up to eight hours
it comes out not so much like a spray
it's a little it's a little sporty it's
a little squirty but that's okay I don't
exactly know how good it is in terms of
protecting you from the Sun I'm always
skeptical about SPF sprays and oils and
stuff like that but still I'm excited to
try that I got a blow drier because this
is what this was in they're like just
arrived section and I been wanting a
tiny little blow dryer to travel with me
and I thought this was awesome this is
the mini blast travel ionic
dryer it had pretty good reviews people
said that it was pretty powerful even
though it was so small I'm excited I'm
excited to see like how powerful this
little guy really is okay so two more
things before I jump into Z makeup I
bought I was watching my friend Laura on
YouTube the other day mrs. Lowell Elaine
Porter is falling asleep sitting down
he's like she posted a video the other
day talking about like her top five
favorite perfumes or like her perfume
collection and we like a lot of the same
sense so when she posted that video I
picked up to travel perfumes based on
her recommendation and one I'm crazy
about and one I do not like that much so
let's talk about the one that I'm
obsessed with and it is Tom Ford and war
this is so expensive Tom Ford perfumes
are insane
they're so pricey obviously since I had
never smelled it and I ordered this
online I just bought the rollerball guys
this smells incredible it smells so
sexual like that's how I can describe it
it's a very sexy like dark scent I got
picture a woman in a bar in the 40s
she's a redhead she's wearing this and
the men cannot get enough of her so good
it's so good that I literally like
freaked out when I got in the mail and I
purchased the bottle using my 15% off
code and then the one that I don't like
I don't like so much it's this right
here this is Beach by Bobbi Brown
everyone loves this just have really
really really great reviews online so I
was like oh that's a no-brainer I'm
gonna get it I'm gonna love it like it
definitely smells beachy like I can I
can see why it's called Beach but to me
it has like a strong powdery undertone
it kind of gives me a headache I don't
know what it is I don't really love it
the beachy sense I like I'm more
coconuty and more like tropically not so
I don't know there's something about
this that I don't like but I'm gonna
give this to my mother because my mother
would love this okay so let's move on to
the makeup this is what I was most
excited for
I was literally waiting for the sale to
purchase this because ever since I heard
duck
talk about this I wanted to buy it
Jacqueline spoke about this in a couple
recent videos this is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk compact this is the
luminous silk powder foundation and she
was saying great things about this this
is so much money and I was so skeptical
about it I was expecting to get this in
the mail and be like okay you know I
have a ton tons of powders that feel the
exact same way but no this powder is
amazing
I got mine in the shade number four and
I'm wearing it today I love this I can't
I can't deny I can't sit here and lie to
you guys I freaking love this this is
ideal for dry skin it just looks
beautiful like beautiful today was the
first time I used it but instantly when
I put it on my face I was like that's
why it's a million dollars ha ha ha
speaking of Giorgio Armani luminous silk
I was browsing the just arrived section
as I always do I am a just arrived
section stalker on my Sephora app and I
noticed that there was smaller versions
of the Giorgio Armani luminous silk like
smaller bottles like this little bottle
right here I threw away the box I don't
know why that I did this comes with
point 6 fluid ounces and this is around
the $40 mark which is still ridiculously
priced if you wanted to get this full
size it's like 62 dollars it's
ridiculous it's so pricy still has a
pump and everything and it was in the
$40 range yeah it's not cheaper but when
you're someone who has about a million
foundations and you rarely go through a
full foundation it kind of benefits me
to get the smaller bottle I know what
you guys are thinking didn't you hate
that foundation
remember Kathleen it made you look like
a greasy hot dog are you delusional yes
I remember
I do but something was telling me to
give this another shot I tried this out
like two times when I was living in Key
West and it was like on the hottest days
of life and it did make me look like a
greasy hot dog at the end of the day and
I wasn't feeling it but for some reason
when I saw it in a smaller little bottle
I was like you know what I'm gonna give
her another shot
and Here I am giving it another shot
it's the foundation I'm wearing today
I don't know call me crazy but I might
like it I don't know the sale gets tip
me guys he gets to me I got a lipgloss
from the brand
Besame I got this amazing lipgloss this
is tangerine and I don't hear a lot of
people talking about this brand but they
have pretty good lip products from what
I've tried I'm wearing this lip gloss
today on top of a from Miami fever
liquid lipstick and I really like it it
is a little sticky but I don't mind that
especially if you want your lip gloss to
last a really long time usually the
sticky ones are the ones that are long
wearing so I got that lip gloss this I
got because of nikkietutorials I think
she spoke about this in a recent
favorites video it is the ardency in
bunker rock on waterproof liquid liner I
got mine in the shade black and it's the
liquid liner I'm wearing on my eyes
today it reminds me a lot of Kat Von D
trooper the reason I picked it up is
because she said it was like Kat Von D
trooper but better is like the Kat Von D
one but it's a felt tip instead of a
brush tip and I find it's just a little
bit easier to use it's super super matte
and super black this is awesome
something I did not like this is the
Laura Mercier bronze butter face and
body veil this isn't a shade of gold
lust this is like a cream bronzer and I
don't know if I just had different
expectations for it but I found that
there was no payoff like no color payoff
like barely anything maybe it's supposed
to be like that but it's just like too
sheer for me I don't know it just gives
me like the same illusion as this spray
does and I feel like the spray is easier
I just kind of expected it to be more
pigmented and actually show up as a
bronzer something a little bit more warm
and more pigmented but it's just pretty
much like a creamy golden glitter veil
it's weird not my favorite so and then
the last thing I got was something from
NARS this is their hot sand illuminator
if you saw my favorites video I am
obsessed with the limited edition NARS
duo that has Laguna and hot sands so I
thought I would get the hot sands
illuminator like the liquid because I
love
the powder so much and this is such a
pretty natural like liquid highlight I
love it I first want to blend this out
on my hand I was like okay this is
nothing like this is literally nothing
but I feel like this would be perfect to
mix in with foundation or to use as a
primer it's not glittery it's not like
intense just gives you like the right
amount of glow just like the powder it's
subtle but still really beautiful okay
