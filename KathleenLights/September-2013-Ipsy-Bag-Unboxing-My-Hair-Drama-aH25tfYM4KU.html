get on to the video I'm going to address
the elephant in the room and that is my
hair yes it is dark brown and I will
tell you that this was not my intention
if any of you guys follow me on
instagram you know that I posted a
picture talking about how I was going to
get my hair done and I went in wanting
to get an ombre I wanted it to fade from
like a brown to very very blond like I
wanted it to have sort of like my
natural color on my roots and then to go
to like the caramel color I had before
and then I wanted it to be like blonde
and then this happened I don't know how
it happened I went to a professional and
I showed the person multiple pictures of
what I wanted I went in there with the
intentions of going lighter and I came
out with my hair ten times darker I was
very upset when I looked in the mirror I
was like what the it was just
really really shocking to me and I don't
know if you can tell but my hair looks
very green where all my blonde
highlights used to be it is now green
hair oh you can see why I was pretty
upset I was actually planning on filming
this video yesterday or the day before
and I was just in a bad mood like I
wasn't feeling it but then I realized
you know it's just hair and there are
other things in life that are more
important though me sitting here feeling
bummed about my hair when there are
actual real issues in the world just
made me get over it really quick I am
going in tomorrow to start getting it
lightened again the process all over
again I don't like dark hair on me
especially dark hair with a hint of
green so hopefully very soon the
original kathleenlights will be back to
normal this this is stopping very soon
tomorrow I probably won't have this hair
color okay now moving on to the actual
video I'm sorry if this intro was like
five minutes long oops by the way I'm
feeling very baggy today I'm just in
t-shirt and jeans it's Sunday so Danny's
just sitting at home watching football
and we are we're like not doing anything
today so I'm just in t-shirt and jeans
because we're not doing anything today
okay now moving on I got my empty bag in
the mail a couple days ago and I wanted
to do my monthly unboxing video so here
we go okay so when you go to pull out
the bag you have these two cards this is
just basically to tell you all the
brands that you could possibly get let's
be real nobody Rize and then this is the
other card I guess just to promote her
new makeup line Michelle Phan came up
with a makeup brand called M and oh it
comes with a sample of her makeup the
natural talent palette or something like
that oh my god they're little samples of
a blush and three eyeshadows that's cool
now moving on to the actual bag this is
what the bag looks like this month I
really love this color not a fan of like
the pattern on it but I mean it's cute
whatever okay so the first thing I see
when I open this bag is actually
something that I was hoping I didn't get
and it is the john frieda for repair
shampoo and conditioner the reason why I
wasn't too crazy about this is because I
feel like shampoo and conditioner is one
of those things that people are very
picky about not everybody likes the same
chef who not everybody uses the same
kind of ingredients in their shampoo and
conditioners so I was kind of skeptical
when they were sending this I was like
oh that's going to be very hit and miss
for a lot of people and it is probably a
miss for me I'm not really into the John
Frieda shampoo and conditioners but if
you are that's great that they give you
this it's pretty good sample sizes be
full size of these products are about
seven dollars each so yeah
this is the first thing
in my bag the second thing I see is this
starlooks coal I pencil and we got a
starlooks product in one of our empty
bags a couple months ago and I was in
love with it it was a really creamy lip
liner I loved it
so hopefully the eye coals are just as
good
okay so this is black it is pretty black
but it doesn't go on super creamy I mean
it isn't drying at all I made like seven
lines there you can see it isn't it
isn't very drying it does go on creamy
not the creamiest I felt but it is
pretty creamy and it is very black and
this by itself is $12 which is already
more than what you pay clear to back
that's good
next thing is this little sample of a
mascara it's called it's so big
volumizing mascara by Elizabeth Mott I
cannot see that we open it cuz I can't
see it
ok so it's a pretty small mascara it's a
decent sample though and it comes with a
fiber bristle one it's not rubber which
is typically what I go for anyway so
hopefully I like this mascara so the
full-size version of this mascara is
actually $19.99 so I'm pretty sure this
is a high-end mascara I've never heard
of this brand but it's pretty expensive
and then the last thing in the bag is
something that everyone got everyone got
a NYX full-size eyeshadow I got mine in
the color velvet suede and it is a color
I probably would never wear I don't
typically wear baby blue eyeshadow it's
not my thing but they are very pigmented
and they are very good eye shadows so
I'm sure that everyone who got an itchy
back this month we'll probably get some
use out of these eyeshadows I could
probably use this in the winter for like
a winter I just realized I'm not wearing
earrings I always wear earrings I'm just
off I am just completely off anyway like
I was saying I could probably use this
eyeshadow in the winter for like a
winter wonderland themed
makeup look that I'm actually thinking
about doing so oh so I'll definitely
keep it but I'm not something I would
wear on a day-to-day basis and the price
of these eyeshadows are 450 okay guys so
that was everything I got in this
month's epsy back I've got to be honest
it is not my favorite bag that I've ever
received I wasn't too thrilled about the
shampoo and conditioner and the color of
my eyeshadow but these two products
seemed pretty good so I mean it's it's
50/50 I definitely have liked other bags
in the past more than this one but I
still think that if C is worth it I mean
you're not going to love them all so
okay so that was it thank you so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
so as always I'm going to try out these
products for you okay I took off all of
my eye makeup because I figured since we
got a little sample of the end cosmetics
from of my hair aside from everything I
figured I would try out these little
samples okay so I'm going to try out the
blush the blush is nice it just has too
much shimmer for my liking
not my favorite okay let's see these
eyeshadows
okay so the eyeshadows are nice I mean
they're pretty pigmented I will zoom in
at the end I'm going to try out the
starlooks Kohl eyeliner
it goes on the water line pretty smooth
actually ow
okay stab myself a little bit okay so I
recommend being very careful with this
before you tight line like I said it's
not the creamiest eyeliner but it does
it up now for what I'm really interested
in my mascara
okay so this mascara is actually pretty
good but extremely messy
I got mascara all over my eyelids and I
usually doesn't happen with me when I'm
putting on mascara so yeah the mascara
is pretty good in terms of length but I
got mascara all over the place but I
mean it's a good mascara um the
eyeshadows blend really good it seems
like the M cosmetics is pretty good not
something I'm typically interested in
but I mean it's pretty good I did not
like the blush and the eyeliner went on
pretty smooth it didn't seem to smear
was a little bit more rough than what I
prefer but not too bad so yeah I think
that's it I think I'm done with the
little review yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
