which means I'm going to be filming my
September favorites today and I wasn't
gonna film this video at all actually
because I only have five things I want
to talk about but I want to make a habit
of filming these videos every single
month no matter what because they're
probably my favorite videos to watch
like I just love seeing what people are
loving at the moment so yeah just
because they're only five things doesn't
make it any less of a favorite to you so
let's just go ahead and get started oh
and I also have one regret this month
that I'm gonna share with you guys I
never have regrets in my favorites
videos just because I do a lot of
research before I buy a product so I'm a
little shocked that this just didn't
work for me but I will talk about that
at the end of the video anyway okay so
my first favorite I was really impressed
with when I first bought it and it is
this bareMinerals little duo in the
Epiphany that's what it's called
and it just comes with two eyeshadows
and these are what the eyeshadows look
like it comes with such a beautiful
shimmery kind of taupe and a nice deep
matte Brown I am so obsessed with this
guy's you have no idea I have worn this
little duo to work almost every single
day and it makes me so incredibly happy
because I've been on the hunt for the
perfect taupe for the longest time I
don't know if you guys have ever heard
me say it but every time I think like
ooh that's a beautiful taupe and I buy
it and it just doesn't go on right like
it comes off flaky or the pigments and
show up and it just gets me so bad I
have been looking for such a nice taupe
for such a long time and I have found it
this is the most pigmented taupe color I
have ever seen in my life it doesn't go
on flaky or patchy it is gorgeous and
this brown color complements it's so
beautifully like literally all you need
are these two eyeshadows on your eyes
and it's like the most beautiful eye
look it's amazing I had actually never
tried bare minerals eyeshadows before
this I've actually never tried anything
from bare minerals before this and I am
completely sold these eyeshadows the
pigmentation is awesome it's super
creamy and smooth I love these I'm
definitely gonna go pick up some more
definitely interested in bareMinerals
now it's this just sold me I love this
so much and it was only $17 I mean that
is pretty pricey but considering that
just one Mac eye shadow is almost $17
it's pretty good okay so my next
favorite is this liquid eyeliner by NYC
and I'm pretty sure it was like $2 yeah
it is a liquid liner with a brush tip
not a felt tip which felt tip eyeliner
czar usually what I tend to go for but
this one is a brush tip and holy
guacamole I have never used an eyeliner
that is this matte in my entire life
when I tell you that this eyeliner is
matte I mean business
I was searching online for a liquid
eyeliner that is really really mad I
wanted it as matte as can be um and a
lot of people were talking about this
eyeliner and I was like NYC that's
extremely cheap I'm gonna give it to go
and I did and it is incredible I know a
lot of people have had problems with
this saying that it flakes off in
patches or like it gets kind of crusty
towards the end of the day and that it
doesn't last long I haven't had that
problem with it I don't usually have
problem with eyeliner smudging or
flaking off um I don't know maybe my
eyelids I don't know but I haven't had a
problem with it and I definitely think
it's worth trying out anyway just
because it's like two dollars and it is
so mad I'm someone that doesn't like the
glossiness of the eyeliner it just I
don't know I feel like eyeliner looks
kind of cheap when it's a little glossy
it's actually the eyeliner I'm wearing
right now and surprisingly it's super
easy to use I would think that a brush
tip wouldn't be as easy as a felt tip
but hey it is my next favorite is an
oldie but goodie I've had it for so long
it's probably my third purchase of this
and it is the Mac blush in harmony this
is probably the first Mac product I've
ever used in my life I was like about 15
when I started using this 15 or 16 I
don't know if it's because I took it
from my sister or if I took it from my
mother I don't know one of them uses
this or use this before and I use it as
a bronzer if the
victim at brunch because it's not too
red it's not too orange it's not too
gray it's like the perfect shade for me
and it just makes me look so tan and
nice and it's a perfect contour shade
for me you definitely could use this as
a blush it would be a really pretty
blush and it is perfect for the Fall
it's like the perfect fall color so if
you're looking into blushes that Mac
maybe you could check this one out cuz
it's really nice so the other day I was
at Target and I made a shocking
discovery in the elf section and that is
this lip lock pencil I had never seen
him before I didn't even know that elf
means something like this but I was
reading the box and I was like I have
been wanting something like that for a
really long time I don't know if you
guys are familiar but Urban Decay makes
a lip liner that is clear I think it's
called ozone and it's basically um so
that your lipsticks don't feather or
bleed out and I have been wanting that
for a really long time but it's a little
expensive for me to wait on the clip
liner I was like I don't know I don't
know if I want to waste that much I'm
gonna live like yeah certain things I'll
splurge for a lip liner I don't know so
then I saw the elf make something that's
exactly the same and it is called the
lip lock pencil and it looks like this
it is a lip liner that is completely
clear and all you basically do is line
the outside part of your lips like like
if you were using a lip liner but a
little bit more on the skin kind of
creating a barrier from your lip to your
skin on your face if that makes any
sense and then you just fill in your
lips with your regular lipstick so if
you're one of those people that loves
wearing dark lips that are very glossy
and it's always feathering and bleeding
and it's always getting smudged all over
your face and it's annoying
I know then definitely check this out
because this will not let your lipstick
bleed I know it sounds amazing and it is
I actually tried it the other day I wore
uptown mauve
I wore uptown now from Milani and it is
a pretty dark lipstick and it can get a
little you know feathery because it is a
glossy lipstick so I tried this on and
my lipstick did not bleed or feather so
definitely check it out if you're having
trouble with your lipstick like bleeding
awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
and for my last favorite I'm kind of
cheating because I've only had this for
like 10 days yes I know but it is my
Sigma creme de Couture palette I love
this thing I just got it recently but I
have been loving and been using it all
the time I love these two colors it's
orange and the brown the brown is so
beautiful I use it in my crease all the
time it just comes with so many fun
colors I wish they would have launched
this in the summer but you know what can
you do a beautiful palette and it is
pretty inexpensive considering how many
eyeshadows you get in the palette and it
is about I want to say $32 so and the
Purple's are so beautiful these greens
right here so people got a green fan but
they're still really beautiful this
palette is so nice ok guys so that was
it for my favorites of the month I know
it was a little bit but those are things
I have just been obsessing over recently
now I'm gonna talk about my product
regret and before I show you guys I know
a lot of you love this and I know that
it's pretty popular on YouTube like I
feel like everyone looks it like
everyone everyone loves it and here I am
the black sheep who hates it I know I'm
sorry but it is the L'Oreal True Match
super blendable crayon concealer I know
don't hate me but I don't like this it's
just a concealer in a crayon and it's
actually very very smooth and very
blendable like I'm amazed at the fact
that a concealer in a crayon is so
smooth and creamy but why do I hate it I
will explain right now
this clings on to my dry skin like you
wouldn't believe and you would think
that a concealer that's so creamy and
smooth and blendable wouldn't emphasize
my dry skin so
but it really does I actually use it
today it's the only thing I have on my
face I didn't use foundation I just used
this kind of like on my pimples and
underneath my eyes and around my nose
where I get really red around my nose
and when I was done I was like I even
put on some powder and then I put on
some blush and bronzer and even that
like it just didn't sit on my face well
like I don't know if you can tell you
probably cannot but there's like patches
of bronzer like my bronzer didn't go on
very smooth at all I would have to get a
little bit closer for you guys to tell
but I have a lot of dry flakiness around
my nose in between my eyebrows around my
mouth like it just started to get super
dry and it's just clinging on to all my
dry skin and it so yeah I had really
high hopes for this product actually
looked for it everywhere I went to
Walmart CVS Target I look for it
everywhere I really wanted to get my
hands on it because I've been looking
for a concealer to use kind of like on
spots on my face and then just go out
the door I don't have to use foundation
and I thought that this would be the
concealer for me but it is not my dry
skin hates this thing which is a huge
bummer but anyway these were my
favorites of the month I really hope you
liked this video guys please subscribe
if you have not already and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
