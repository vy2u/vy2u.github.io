I I know but that's okay
my hair um today is not cooperating with
me
it didn't that really puffy stage so
puffy I woke up today and I was like oh
today's video is going to be my August
no today's video is going to be my
September boxycharm unboxing one of my
favorite times of the month and actually
I have to leave my house soon before it
starts to downpour like crazy it's about
to rain really badly so I better make
this quick oh so this is what the inside
of the Bach the Bach this were the tip
of the box looks like this month it has
this cute little card thing right here
that says 20% off your purchase from
Tarte calm if you use the code full
block see if you have been wanting to
buy something on the Tarte website then
go ahead and use the code fall Block C
and get 20% off I will put the code down
below just in case you forget okay so
then we get the card in the box that
says Fashion Week fabulous that's your
card on the back it gives you a list of
prices and descriptions so I never toss
this card okay so the first thing we get
in this month's boxycharm is a Coastal
Scents palette and this one is in Cairo
I think they gave out like maybe four
different palettes I could be wrong but
I find this so incredible because it's
an actual palette you know how some
monthly subscription services just give
you like a couple of eyeshadows as like
samples or something but this is a real
full palette has 12 eyes shadows which
is great this is the perfect kind of
palette to travel with because of the
mirror and it has really nice neutral
shades some shimmer some matte I'm
actually a pretty big fan of Coastal
Scents
in general they were the first makeup
brushes I ever bought they I really like
their eyeshadows I think they're pretty
good for the price I'm not saying their
makeup forever
but they're really good for the price
and these palettes retail for 1295 and
obviously this is a full size palette it
looks pretty small because it is like a
little compact palette but it's 1295
$13 and I'm excited to use this next
thing in the Box is this NC la Los
Angeles nail polish I think I've heard
of this brand before I'm not sure maybe
I've seen it somewhere mmm I don't know
and I got mine in the shade call my
agent
this is such a pretty polish I don't
know if you could tell it's a red but it
has like it's like neon I'm not using it
you see how it's like a little bit
brighter than a regular red love it I
love red nail polish I think it looks so
classy and the bottle is really really
really cute too
this is obviously a full size and this
retails for $16 for a nail polish that's
expensive okay so the next thing in the
box really excited about it is a
full-size Carina Tarantino mascara it
the mascara is called feared the flat
fleur de leche fleur the lash all at all
um I love to read a Tarantino boxycharm
is actually the monthly subscription
service that introduced me to it because
I had no idea what this brand was and
all of you guys were like I love you
guys but a lot of you guys were like oh
my god that's a great brand they sell it
at Sephora or they used to its high-end
really good quality and we got a full
status miss Curt got a full-size mascara
and the packaging is beautiful it has
like that classic Terina Tarantino
packaging look at this look at this how
pretty
let me see the wand oh yeah oh yeah that
is my kind of one it is a little bit
larger but I love wands like this for
some reason I feel like I'm gonna like
this
it has like the natural bristles which I
prefer you guys know I love it this is
full-size of course don't even have to
tell you guys that this retails for $19
and
in our box is the tarte lipsurgence lip
gloss
which is amazing tarte is a great brand
it's an amour it's a more expensive
brand they sell that at Sephora
everyone loves Tarte for a good reason
that I just love tart so they gave out
one lip gloss and each box and this one
is in the shade tipsy it's that really
pretty bright coral color this is a
full-size lip gloss and this retails for
$19 the last thing in the Box is in this
thing and Santa bag almost broke this oh
this is a little perfume oh it's wet in
here nice this is a perfume and it
smells absolutely amazing perfumes are
always really weird to get in
subscription boxes cuz everybody has
different tastes in perfume different
taste in perfume yeah different taste
super here but oh my goodness this
smells amazing hello by Harvey prints so
yes
the perfume is called hello oh it has
the notes here Mayer lemon white
grapefruit and Satsuma mandarin yeah it
definitely smelled the fruitiness in
this for sure this is a full-size
product it's like kind of like a
rollerball type of thing only it has a
spray instead of like a roller so it is
a full-size product and this retails for
$29 this is such a great thing to just
throw in your purse and that's exactly
where you're going okay so the total
value of the box this month was $96 and
it is real real $96 because everything
in the box is full-size this is a great
subscription service if you are tired of
the samples if you've done other
subscription services and you're like I
want full-size I want to always have
full-size then I would definitely
recommend box trim it is more expensive
than say it C or something like that but
personally I think you get more bang for
your buck because everything I got was
full size so I mean
and you want to see some of these
products in action they budging okay so
you guys are gonna hate me you guys are
really gonna hate me but I'm not gonna
be able to try on the this nail polish
because my nails are painted oh but this
is such a pretty color
I'm sorry okay so I'm just gonna try out
like a couple little colors from this
palette right here this guy I'm just
gonna take this matte Brown right here
and pop it in degrees this is a little
morphe brush
I didn't even put on some primer I just
have a little bit of like concealer from
when I was doing my under eye concealer
I just pops them on my lid so I like it
I've always been impressed with Coastal
Scents I'm just going to take this
little highlight shade it's yellowy gold
oh that's pretty
I like that I'm going to get this dark
brown
I just wanted to show you like a little
bit of crease action so you can see the
pigmentation it's good shadows for the
price it's this definitely is a palette
that's going to come in handy for me
because it's just so compact and it has
a bunch of colors in it I'm going to
take off my mascara trying to take off
my mascara I smudged my eyeliner so
ignore the hot mess that's happening
right here this is a closer look of the
mascara most amazing packaging in the
history of the universe and
okay so this is two coats of the Tarina
Tarantino mascara and the wand is big it
is big but I did my bottom lashes with
it and I didn't have a problem with it I
just obviously had to like look down and
then wiggle it and it worked and I love
this mascara like look at it I did have
to do two coats so the first coat I was
like huh
but then two coats I really really like
it I know that this is gonna be the type
of mascara that I love once it dries up
a little bit I like more of a drier
formula this is wet if you like a wet
mascara you won't like this but when it
dries up a little bit I'm going to be
really in love with it I just no but I
mean you could tell it did a nice it
gave me length and volume I really like
it I'm gonna go ahead and do this I and
I'll be right back
okay so I'm quickly going to show you
what this looks on my lips there's
definitely a more summer color but you
know let's wing it oh the heck's this
has a really cool applicator it like
bends here explain it
it's a doe foot applicator but it like
the nevermind
this smells really good that's tart what
do you expect okay so this lipgloss is
not super super pigmented but it is
super glossy and very shiny this would
look so pretty on top of a lipstick on
top of the lipstick I was wearing
actually before I took it off to but to
apply this that one looked so pretty
it's definitely a really pretty lip
gloss topper okay guys so that was
