my buck C Sherman Buxton I love how you
guys refer to it as buck see Sherm now I
think that's so funny I don't know why I
caught a Moxie Sherm okay you know the
drill this month is my August Vox
September you know the drill let's open
this bad boy gonna get a scissor this
time but I don't break a nail
okay so this is what ZBOX looks like
this month it says run run run way for
some reason that's a hard word to say
runway-ready
say that five times fast run away why
didn't I read one word anyway so yes
alright let's dive in so the biggest
thing is this this is the provides skin
type hydro milk
it says hydration with potent
antioxidant botanicals hydro milk
contains active levels of natural
ingredients to help improve skin
hydration and fight free radicals Oh
drop the card okay this is $48 you're
ready Norma's hey that's offensive
it says nourish and moisturize your skin
what does this spit I don't get it is
this like a moisturizer this is a
moisturizer basically yeah hydro milk
like a milky moisturizer it says it
contains natural ingredients to help
improve skin type duration apply daily
on to the palm of your hands and then
gently massage in a circular motion on
to face and neck so this doesn't have
SPF so you're gonna have to put on SPF
underneath this this is a big size this
is a full-size obviously it's $48 it
says it's formulated for sensitive skin
and areas prone to dryness test around
the eyes ear lobes and below the chin
mmm smell this for some crazy reason
alright like the packaging I don't know
it's like I like it
that's my landing okay so the next thing
is this this is from the brand Vasanti
we've actually got a Vasanti brush in
our box before this is like a typical
foundation brush I don't use these
brushes for foundation for foundation I
always say for fair foundation but I
always use these brushes for face masks
I know it sounds weird but you can even
asked Danny he'll vouch for me I have
like three of these in my bathroom and I
use them for different face masks I hate
the feeling especially for a clay face
masks like mud masks I hate the feeling
of putting it on with my fingers is that
strange am i weird probably so I just
like put it on with brushes like this
and I feel like it is more hygienic as
well I mean you can use this for a
foundation but I like your for face
masks so this is a full-sized product
and it is $32 oh right II think oh my
god this is crazy
okay so I didn't notices this is a
little thing like this which I'm pretty
sure actually this is a sample oh it's a
bonus item wait a minute how many
products one two three four five there
are six products in the box this month
and this is a bonus that's cool this is
from the brand Kardashian beauty I've
never seen this in any monthly
subscription like the Kardashian line it
is the black seed dry oil
let me read about it because I have no
idea what that means it says a
nutrient-rich treatment and styling aid
that rejuvenates and nourishes hair so
it appears strong thick smooth and
gloriously shiny apply a small amount
into palms and distribute evenly onto
damp hair or used to smooth frizz at
roots and ends or add shine to dry hair
let me smell it
of course oh it's covered
well I can't tell I can't smell it oh
it's oh it is dry this is a dry oil oh
I'm gonna put some in my hair
this smells really good it smells like
argan oil I like this I like this it's a
cute little bonus item and it smells
delish so next thing in here is this
thing this is scratch I guess the brand
is called scratch and they are nail
wraps I've actually never tried nail
wraps
oh no I'm nervous I'm excited though
I've always wanted to but I've always
felt like I would suck at it it comes
with a little cuticle pusher a nail file
and the nail wraps is a really cool
design it's like gold and white yeah I'm
gonna give this a go wish me luck
because I suck at nail stuff and then
the last thing in this box is this and
this is from the brand Tarte which is a
high-end brand so that Sephora I love
Tarte and it is their smolder eyes
Amazonian clay waterproof liner in the
shade gold and it comes with like a
smudgy side and then like the eyeliner
side oh my gosh that's beautiful that is
such a stunning gold like old gold color
I actually really love this I thought it
was gonna be a like yellow gold but it's
more of a bronze I don't know why I
thought it would be a yellow gold
because it matches the packaging come on
Kathleen but it is beautiful I'm gonna
actually add some to my lower lash line
I really like this a lot I really like
that oh I love it I like that it wasn't
the last thing in this box I just didn't
notice because the last thing is so
later and this is what it looks like
this is the q3
this is the cella eyebrow defining gel
this is full-size and it is $18 I have
gotten chela before I think right we've
got in that brand okay so it is a clear
brow gel I'm glad that it's clear not
tinted because obviously not everyone
has the same I already have eyebrow gel
on so I don't want to put on on top
because I don't want that to sway my
opinion but I will update you in another
video if I think this is good or not so
yeah that is everything I've got in the
box this month six items this month that
is amazing so I did the math and the
overall value for this box is a hundred
and thirty-two dollars that is freaking
insane
you pay twenty one dollars a month for
this box guys if you haven't checked out
boxycharm please do so because you get
your money's worth and then some because
most of the time everything in the box
is full-size like ninety nine point nine
point nine and I'm a ninety percent of
time
it's full-size so you're not just paying
for little samples in the mail and you
get good stuff I'm like amazed tart oh
my if I like them this month I mean I
like most months but I like this month a
lot right I think it's so worth your
money
132 dollar value that's insane anyway so
let me know what your favorite product
in the box was this month thank you guys
