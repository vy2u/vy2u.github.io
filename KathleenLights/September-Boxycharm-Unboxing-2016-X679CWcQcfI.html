my sexy Sherman Beck's I'm cheating this
month I actually opened it already okay
so if you guys follow me on instagram
you saw that i posted this picture at
the end of august boxycharm actually
sent me that palette because they wanted
me to test it out since that palette was
gonna be featured in the September box
so I already know that that palette is
in my box I mean and I also opened it
and I thought that maybe I would do this
video a little bit differently let me
know in the comments if you prefer this
kind of unboxing I don't have done it in
the past but I want to make sure 100%
I'm gonna be sharing with you the
products I got inside I actually haven't
opened anything inside the box i just
opened the box and i saw what was in
here and i thought it would be a good
idea to try them on as i go
that's why i only have my face makeup on
not my eye makeup let me know if that's
something you would like or do you
prefer me just talking and then
inserting clips of me using it i think
this way it's kind of fun because i get
to try it out and tell you my thoughts
like right away so yes this is all well
this is what the box looks like this
month and i'm just gonna get started and
of course i'm gonna grab this guy right
here this is the palette i was talking
about this is from the brand studio
makeup and it is their on-the-go
I shadow palette I have been playing
around with the one that they sent me
I'm not gonna swatch this one at all
because I'm gonna give it to my cousin
but this palette is awesome it actually
reminds me a lot of the Kylie Jenner
palette the pigmentation is so good I
really really love this let me let me go
grab mine I haven't had coffee in a long
time and I'm drinking it today and I
feel wired okay so like I said this is
the studio makeup on the go palette this
is full size and it actually retails for
$49.95 I didn't think it was this pricey
but I mean that's pretty cool because
you only paid $1 for your box so that's
really nice and it's included in the box
okay so I'm not gonna do like a
full-blown smokey eyes I have to go run
errands and I don't want this to turn
into a tutorial but I'm going to take
this color right here and put it
underneath my brow bone and in my inner
corners
I'm going to take this color right here
and put it in my crease
I'm going to take this dark brown shade
and do the same thing pretty much just
add this on the outer corner drag it
into the crease a little bit
and then I'm just going to take this
beautiful Mitchell color I'm going to
put it all over the lid and then add a
little bit of black on the outer corners
you
and then I'm just going to add a little
bit of this brown to the lower lash line
and put on some mascara
so I think this palette is great I
quickly wanted to show you me applying
some of the shadows just so you can see
their pigmentation perfect for traveling
you have all your neutral shades and
even a black so good stuff okay now that
we've been talking about that full 18
minutes okay so the next parts and
bosses just a little guy right here I
love these things I got so excited when
I saw this in the box this is the pure
lip layer hydrating lip lacquer I have a
ton of these colors what colors is fiery
do I have this one I'm not sure I have
to check I actually have a few of these
in my collection these are really really
nice it goes on like if it was a liquid
lipstick but it doesn't dry completely
matte which I don't mind because they
last so long on the lips and it gets
your lips like a really nice shine I'm
gonna be twisting this for like a
million hours I see it there it is yeah
I definitely don't have this color and
oh I have lipstick on let me take it off
oh my gosh these things are so good this
is like full-on color
the only bad thing about this product is
it's not super precise when you're
applying it you're gonna need to grab an
angled brush maybe some concealer and
kind of fix the edges but I'm not going
to do that today cuz whatever I'm so
happy they included this in the box
because it's something I already own and
have loved I have like more of their
nude everyday shades but this color in
fiery I really like it they almost act
as a stain they last so long this of
course is a full size products and this
retails I don't even notice the theme of
the box this month it's camp glam sorry
I forgot to tell you guys a theme but
anyway this is full-size and this
retails for $22 next up is fet this is
project beauty hair Girt hair vert
project beauty hair girth kind of like
hair yogurt smoothing yogurt hair mask
it's prebiotics quinoa and super
botanicals for beautiful hair sulfate
and paraben free I wonder if this has
silicone in it okay so I think it does
have silicones but it has them like at
the end of the list so it probably has
very little it says it helps tame unruly
frizzy and dry hair I don't know I'm
gonna test it out or maybe give it to my
mom it's in strawberry-banana I'm so if
I can even smell it cuz I'm so stuffy Oh
mmm this smells so good
oh it smells so good smells it smells
like my childhood for some reason I want
this as a perfume this is a full-sized
product and this retails for $11 to more
things in the box this is one of them
this is the Hikari eyeliner in the shade
Raven I think we have bottom this brand
in the box before this is a full-size
eyeliner in this retails for $13 buy the
sticker it appears to be a black
eyeliner oh it's it's one of those
things I have to open oh I hate that
okay oh nice its retractable
okay so it went on my waterline really
nicely I liked that it wasn't drying it
was easy to apply obviously I like to
judge an eyeliner by how long it lasts
in my waterline but so far so good and
then the last thing in the Box actually
a nail polish from butter LONDON
which if you know about butter LONDON it
is a pricy nail polish so it's really
awesome to get it in the box this is in
the shade yummy mummy it's kind of like
a muted gray with a hint of a silver
sheen in there I have my nails painted
so I'm not gonna paint my nails right
now but it's such a pretty color and
this is perfect for the fall because
it's a nice neutral Toby gray color and
this is full size of course and this
retails for $15 okay so the overall
value of this month's box charm is a
hundred and ten dollars which is Gracie
you know it's Gracie
you know it's crazy this month actually
was pretty awesome it's one of my
favorite months in a while boxycharm
