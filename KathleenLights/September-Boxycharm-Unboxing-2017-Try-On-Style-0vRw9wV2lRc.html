mob bucks you Sherman bucks I get a lot
of questions about my little cup this is
a Starbucks cup I bought this on the
Starbucks website and this is where I
drink my Cuban coffee every day I'm
obsessed with this little cup bread is
my favorite color and I just I love it
yeah let's just jump into my boxy Sherm
shall we
so as you can see I have absolutely no
makeup on today there are quite a few
things we're gonna try out in today's
but these two things just spell out the
theme of this box is boxy body and for
his thing in the Box is this I was
really surprised to see this in the box
actually because this is an eyebrow
pencil from Mac it's called eyebrows
literally this is called eyebrows I like
not an eyebrow pencil or anything it
just says eyebrows eyebrows by Mac this
pencil will add everything you need
shape color and density this is
obviously full size and this retails for
$18 and they sent the shade spiked I'm
not sure if they sent that shade to
everyone but that's the shade I got so
that's the shade we're gonna try out
wind it up here and see that wow this is
pretty dark I'm sure we can make it work
I'm use the new wing
okay so obviously this eyebrow pencil is
just a little bit too dark for me I do
like the dark brows but this one might
just be a little too dark for me but I
did like the formula I think it applied
really nicely my brows look hideous on
their own which is why I mean they look
crazy right now I haven't done my brows
in like a month I'm actually going
tomorrow to finally fix them a hair is
like down here it's intense but anyway
besides that I did like the formula I
just didn't like the fact that there
wasn't a spoolie I had to go into
another brow pencil and brush it out
because there is no spoolie on this and
I don't understand why I like a brow
pencil without a spoolie why why yeah so
this is like although it is pretty
interesting that Mac is in a boxy charm
I mean Mac is now at Ulta guys that's
insane
when I was in high school if you weren't
wearing Mac you just like weren't cool
Mac was the it brand and it's so insane
to see that it's now going into Ulta and
colour-pop is going into Sephora like
what its life is insane anyway let's
move on next up in the box is this thing
this is the pure soirée diary's
eyeshadow palette this is a full sized
palette that retails for $34 and these
are what the colors look like they're
very very let me take this thing off
they're very pretty very natural colors
I haven't even swatched them yet oh they
feel super creamy ooh
even this mat feels really really
delicious well so of course I'm gonna
test out a couple of these eyeshadows on
my eyes just so they see a few of them
in action I'm gonna zoom you in really
quick but first I'm gonna apply some
eyeshadow primer and then I will begin
I'm gonna go in with splurge and I'm
gonna use this color in my crease
I'm gonna use this color as my brow bone
highlight going in with this shade now
it's like a reddish brown I'm gonna add
a little bit of this on the outer
corners and in my crease
I'm gonna take this shade and I'm going
to use this on my entire lid why did I
say bid like that blade
now I'm going to take a little bit of
this like dark purple color I'm gonna
add some of this on the outer corners
I'm gonna go back into that shade we
used all over the lid and I'm gonna just
intensify it I'm gonna do my lower lash
line as soon as I'm done applying my
foundation and stuff so let's move on to
that really quick okay I know this video
is all over the place but there the
things are all over the place next thing
in the box is this is our next step to
our makeup this is the bare minerals
face perfecting brush it is a foundation
brush I'm pretty sure this released when
they released their serum foundation and
I think I've already tried this and I
don't remember liking it I always apply
my foundations with a Beauty Blender if
not I use my it cosmetics like heart
foundation brush but I never use like
flat top I never use like these round
flat brushes like this and this one has
a little hole in the middle I don't know
if you can see that but you're supposed
to like drip their serum Foundation into
this little hole but they do say this
foundation brush works with any
foundation so we're gonna try it out
today I'm not sure I'm gonna eat because
I really I just prefer a sponge because
my skin is dry and it just makes the
skin look a little do here I'm actually
gonna take the Too Faced peach perfect
comfort matte foundation I have been
testing this out let me know in the
comments below if you want me to do an
entire review on the whole collection
I've pretty much tested things and I can
give you like a hits and misses video
instead of like a first impressions you
know so I'm gonna use this you actually
do really like this foundation I'm gonna
pump some okay I put it in the hole oh
my gosh wait I didn't even prime the
skin
am I crazy I'm just gonna use a
moisturizer
okay now I'm ready but it's just this is
so weird it's like collected in the hole
so I
I feel like a lot of the foundation
stays collected in that home we're gonna
press and then rub but I felt like a lot
of the foundation was just staying in
that hole and not really coming out but
if you do kind of like press on the skin
it does come out she's gonna add a
little bit more
I like how it fits right in between my
eyebrows that's awesome I probably would
love this brush if it wasn't for that
hole because I actually like how small
it is and it gets perfectly around your
nose your brows all that stuff all right
so really quickly I'm gonna do my
concealer and some powder and some
bronzer and all of that before I
continue on all right now I'm gonna go
back into the pure palette and I'm just
gonna go back in and do my lower lash
line and just you know finish this up
okay so I'm pretty much done with the
eyes I really really like how this look
turned out and like how these blend I
like how these apply I don't know I
really really like this palette it's
very natural perfect for everyday but
you can get a really nice smoky eye out
of this so this one is a winner for me
I'm going to apply some mascara and I
will be right back
okay so we are only halfway through the
box I feel like I've been sitting here
filming this video for hours now but we
are halfway the next thing in the Box is
the sky I was so excited when I saw this
in the Box Ryoji or brioche you one of
my favorite brands and yet I still don't
know how to pronounce it I love this
brand they make one of my favorite
leave-in conditioners and one of my
favorite hair masks they're so good oh
this is thinner mask how did I don't
notice that this is the don't despair
repair deep conditioning mask for some
reason when I opened the box earlier
today to see what was inside I thought
this was something totally different but
yeah this is so exciting it cuz it's in
like a travel size now I could actually
take this with me to travel because mine
is in like a tub you know it's a little
harder to trouble with this isn't the
full size the full size is like 36 or
like $35 this one though is 20 bucks
which I just loved this whole squeeze
thing but I don't think you can get this
one at Sephora I wonder if I can get
this size on the actual website because
I actually prefer this packaging over
there you know but anyway this is a
great deep conditioning hair masque it's
free of sulfates silicone parabens it's
just really really great stuff it's 98%
natural and I just I love this friend so
much I'm so excited that we got this in
the box I'm so excited you guys get to
try this cuz it's such a good hair mess
but okay moving on next ah the box of
this this is from a brand studio makeup
and this is their loose blush got to be
honest that throw me off a little bit
when I first read that because I don't I
don't own any loose blush and I don't
know if I would reach for a loose blush
you know and just the thought of loose
blush kind of makes me nervous but this
color looks so pretty good
here we go I'm not gonna open this all
the way so it's not messy just gonna
leave a little and I'm gonna take my
Linda Hallberg 310 brush and I'm just
gonna dip right into this blush ooh I
like that I'm just gonna play a little
more though I really like this color
it's very natural it does have a sheen
to it but it's not something that's
bothering me it's not like glittery or
anything so this is really nice
Packaging isn't super convenient whose
powders are a little bit more
time-consuming but I really love this
color and you will never run out of this
blush by the way this is called the
luminous loose blush and I don't know
what the name of this blush is it
doesn't say I don't know if they only
have one color or something I'm not sure
okay and then last but not least we have
a colour-pop ultra satin lip which is
amazing I love older satin lips they're
the best formula colour-pop makes and
even though these are only six dollars I
think it's amazing that they're in the
box because it's just so so good and
this one is actually in the shade little
stitches which I just gave this one away
to one of my friends so funny so funny
how life works it just came right back
to me
okay guys so that was everything I got
in this month's but see sure I did the
math on my calculator and the overall
value of this box is one hundred and
forty-one dollars which Wow some of the
things in the box this month were a
little odd for me but I overall really
enjoyed it this is amazing this is so
good
this is amazing these two things were
the only things I was like not my
favorite but I mean for the price you
cannot beat boxy cherm so hey guys let
me know if you like this box this month
you hate it do you love it let's discuss
in the comments below but exactly with
this video guys thank you so much for
