my September favorites these are
products I have been loving in the month
of September and I'm cheating a little
bit because today is September 24th I am
filming this on a Thursday and this
video will be going up until Wednesday
of next week so about a week from now so
these are products I've been loving in
the past three weeks really quickly
before I get into the video you guys
know if you saw my update video that I
can't film videos in October Porter what
you're doing so I have pre-recorded a
ton of videos and the whole month of
October will have pre-recorded videos
because I thought that would be better
than just not posting for an entire
month I'm going to try my best to see if
I can record but I can't make any
promises which is why I'm actually
filming this video a week earlier than I
would normally it's because I am just
way way way too busy and videos from now
on will be pre-recorded but just for a
month hopefully like I'll explain in
another video anyway so let's get into
the products I have been loving in the
month of September okay I have to have
to have to talk about this product I've
only had this product for like a week I
know ridiculous I know it's really dumb
but I need to tell you guys about it
this is the bare minerals bare skin
complete coverage serum concealer this
is one of my new favorite concealers of
all time to me it's up there with Mac
Pro Longwear and Urban Decay Naked skin
not consistency wise but how much I love
it like how much it's a favorite to me
this really feels like I am putting on a
serum it's so lightweight but it's full
coverage at least I feel like it's full
coverage and it just feels so fresh and
light and if I set it right away it will
increase its the concealer that's under
my eyes right now and I don't really
have any concealer on I love it I've
been using it every single day that I've
worn makeup since I got it so I just
quickly wanted to mention it bonus item
okay so this next product you guys
probably saw coming but I have to talk
about the ofra long lasting liquid
lipstick in Miami fever this
is the liquid lipstick I created with
Oprah and surprisingly I'm not wearing
it today even though I love how this
looks with this eye look I love this so
so much I have been wearing it non-stop
it's like all I've been wearing in my
videos if you guys haven't noticed I
think it's so pretty
every time you guys send me a photo on
Twitter I'm wearing this I retweet it at
least the ones I see sometimes I don't
see all of them because so many people
are tweeting that it the pictures just
go to the bottom you guys look so pretty
in this lip color it just suits so many
different skin tones I think like the
deepest of skin tones can wear this and
it looks really stunning and I really
just can't stop wearing it it is the
most comfortable liquid lipstick I own
not this specific one these ofra liquid
lipsticks are also here so I had to give
it a shout-out because I'm very proud of
it and I think it's just so stunning I
will have it down below I will link it
and you could actually get this products
for 40% off using my coupon code I have
all the information down below when I
haven't been wearing the liquid lipstick
which is rare but when I haven't been
wearing it I have been wearing color
pops cream lippy stick in choker this is
like an everyday nude shade but I love
the undertone in this you guys know if
you follow me on snapchat a lot of the
times I'm barefaced
but I have this in my purse I had to go
get it out of my purse I've had this in
my purse and I'll just throw on some
mascara I'll highlight and then I'll
throw this on and I won't even wear
concealer and I just love how it looks I
love this and I do want to mention this
one I have a tutorial coming up using
this this is in the shade grunge another
colour-pop lippie stick this is a
beautiful fall color like if you are
looking at the colour-pop lippie stix
and you're wondering which ones you want
to get for fall I highly recommend
grunge it's that really pretty brown
purple deep color so my next favorite I
have been a die-hard fan of since the
moment I put it on my face for the very
first time
the smashbox camera-ready BB water SPF
30 this is what's on my face right now I
love this it's become a Holy Grail item
for me you have to shake it up right so
you shake it up before you use it and
then it's just like a dropper like that
and then you just push the little button
and it comes out out what did I say alt
how's weird I love this it gives me a
light but buildable coverage like it
covers up my redness really nicely I
would say light to light medium like it
has good coverage for what it is it's a
BB cream but not really because it has
that really watery texture it's it feels
like I'm putting on water on my face I
freaking love this the first time I ever
use this I was here in my beauty room
when my friend Gaby was here and I was
like I don't know I don't know if I like
it I don't know she's like your skin
looks really good that was like I don't
know she's like I like it and then the
more I use it the more I fell in love
it's amazing I highly recommend this if
you have dry skin I don't know if I
would recommend this for oily skin
because it is a dewy like luminous
finish you do have to set it if you
don't want that do we finish I said it
today but a lot of the times I don't set
it oh it does have that dewy appearance
I don't know if you would love it if you
have oily skin but a few people have
actually told me that they have oily
skin and they really like this so I
don't know I would just recommend going
to Sephora and getting a sample of this
it has SPF 30 so it's perfect for a day
to day wear cuz you know that's a really
good amount for your face my I have I'm
the shade light that's what I was trying
to say there my next favorite has been
this bad boy right here I have been
using this non-stop this is the elf mad
format palette and a lot of companies
have come out with palettes like this
where they're just a bunch of matte
neutrals but this one is special to me
because of its packaging is that weird
okay the Kat Von D shade + light eye
palette amazing high-end really great
quality eyeshadows but it's very big and
this one is so little it almost fits in
your bucket so little in your bucket
this is the perfect traveling palette
because you have all the neutrals you'll
ever need I used this on my eyes when I
went to my best friend's baby shower I
used this on my eyes the other day when
I went to a party for it was like a 20s
a Roaring Twenties themed birthday party
and I wore this on my eyes it has every
undertone it has like a warm brown a
pink brown purple a grey like colors to
highlight with and it's such an
affordable palette this is only a few
dollars because it's elf it's very very
affordable so I have been using this a
ton this is the Becca backlight priming
filter this is their primer it's pretty
much brand new ish I purchased this the
second I saw that they came out with
this I was like oh I went online and I
bought it Becca is known for their
highlights like their luminous products
they do they do them so well so when
they came out with a luminizing primer
that claims to make your makeup last all
day I was off for it I don't think it
makes my makeup last all day like oh
it's such a great like prolonging primer
I don't think so but I love the way that
this makes my skin look and foundation
just sits so nicely on top of this like
this makes my face glow and it
moisturizes really well it takes away
all the cracky dryness and how in my
face and I just look like I am radiant
and luminous I love this it was a pricy
primer but Becca is a pricey brand but
you get what you pay for because it is
really good quality okay this is this is
also cheating too I just recently got
this but I wanted to mention this this
is the Wet n Wild Fergie highlighter
this is in the shade Hollywood Boulevard
I wanted to mention this just in case
this is limited edition so you can go
out and get it this isn't the highlight
I'm wearing today of course I should
have worn it but I've been wearing this
on days where I haven't worn makeup like
I just throw on some mascara a little
bit of something through my brows and
that's it and I highlight with this that
may sound weird but the undertone in
this just makes my skin glow I love the
formula of this wet and wild highlight
and it's so big you get a lot of product
and I think it was like five dollars
such an inexpensive product and it gives
you a beautiful glow I love it a lot of
people complain
they can't find really good highlights
from the drugstore and this is one of
them I don't know about any of the other
Fergie highlights but this one in
Hollywood Boulevard
the texture is unreal I love it very
smooth creamy the beautiful sheen up get
it this is really random but I love this
this is the pixi endless brow gel pen
you can get this in the drugstore
section at Target this is basically just
I have mine in the shade medium and it's
not my color
this is a little bit too ashy for me it
makes my eyebrows a little bit gray
toned but I still use it because I love
it I have to sharpen mine so I've used
mine a lot this is basically a tinted
wax like that's all it is and on days
where I'm like oh man I gotta take
Porter to the vet or saline to the vet
you know it's their checkup let me just
throw this on my brows dee dee dee dee
dee to see the wax keeps my hairs in
place and it gives them color so it
makes them look thicker and like shade
it in all the bald areas are filled in
it's just a quick one-stop shop this
little pixie um gel pen so I want to get
it in like a warmer brown shade because
this Brown is too ashy for me but I
really love it okay so something I've
been loving for months and I haven't
spoken about it I don't know why this is
probably my most used little duo of all
time this is the NARS duo in the shade
it's called Isolde it has a warm gold
and a copper this is what's on my eyes
right now this is the only thing I have
in my eyes except I have like a light
warm brown in my crease just to have
like a matte eyeshadow in my crease this
is the only thing on my eyes right now I
use this like it's going out of style Oh
daddy wants to go out to dinner I
grabbed this oh crap I have to do my
makeup but I don't know what to do I
grab this I have worn this so much and I
never wear it in my videos I actually
wore this in my boxycharm unboxing my
most recent one and a lot of you guys
are like oh my god your makeup look so
pretty
and it was this and it's so funny
because I always do my makeup like that
and I decided to wear today in the video
just so you can see this is like my
everyday
I shadow look when I want to try like
when I actually wanted to eyeshadow I
always grab this NARS is a pricey brand
but this little duo is worth every penny
I use it like it's going out of style so
I used to not like this but recently I
really have been liking this this is the
essence I hurt stage I should but I say
that right I hurt stage eyeshadow base
this is a $2.00 eye primer and I like
this I didn't used to like this before
because it was a really dark yellow
color and it doesn't work when I'm super
fair but when I have a tan to my skin I
love this primer because it covers up
all my veins and it gives like a yellow
but not like a jaundiced
tint but it gives it like a nice yellow
tint to my eyes kind of like a warm
color it looks like I have cream
eyeshadow on but I don't it's really
nice and it does make my eyeshadows more
vibrant I really really love this I got
this I bought this at Ulta essence is so
underrated I love that brand and I have
been using this a lot on my off days
like on my off filming days so I just
wanted to give it a little shout out
everybody was really into the it
cosmetics bye bye pores loose powder
everyone loves it but I didn't like it
because I didn't like opening a jar and
done and going through the trouble of
using a loose powder even though the
Laura Mercier translucent loose powder
is heaven-sent so I go through the
trouble with that one but I just didn't
want to go through the trouble with it
cosmetics one I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna lie to you guys it wasn't like my
favorite but this it was upside down
this is on another level good I don't
know if the fact that it's pressed it
makes it at ten times better but it does
this is the cosmetics bye bye pores
airbrush silk pressed finishing powder
it has collagen silk peptides and
antioxidants it cosmetics has really
good ingredients in their in their
makeup and this is in the shade
translucent I have been using this so
much I find that actually is translucent
even though it looks like the color of
paper right here but but let me show you
like okay look at my finger do you see
anything barely anything on my finger
but somehow it sets your makeup really
nice
that's your under-eyes really nicely and
especially this area right here Eddie
ray psa's your pores this is wizardry I
don't know it's magic so I only have
three more things to talk about I know
my favourites videos are really long
but you guys tell me you like my long
videos so you guys know that I don't
really wear false lashes all that much
to be completely honest with you I only
wear them on special occasions when I'm
going out at night with Danny like if
I'm going out to dinner with Danny's
like a nice dinner
I wear eyelashes or anywhere like where
I'm out at night I think that falsies
look really pretty and occasionally in
my tutorials the House of lashes eyelash
adhesive is my all-time favorite I've
purchased like a million of those but I
have to talk about this one from the
Brenna sceeto this is the companion'
long lasting bond this eyelash glue is
on another freaking level I don't even
know how to describe it it like sticks
my fingers together like it is so tacky
the House of lashes one is tacky as well
but this one is even tackier I will
continue to purchase the House of lashes
one but I had to give a shout out to
this one because I have been using this
one since I got it in the mail and it
like gets tacky immediately like you
could wait 10 seconds and then put your
eyelashes on and it'll stick to your
lashes for the entire night and your
eyelashes will not plop off in the front
or anything like that
unreal Oh remember when I said I only
had three more products to share with
you I lied now I have three more
products to share with you and that's it
I want to give a quick shout out to this
guy right here because I fell in love
with it the moment I put this on my
nails this is the Essie nail polish in
the shade leggy legend it came out for
their Fall collection I love colors like
this that remind me of fall leaves like
autumn it's like a metallic sheen that
sometimes looks green sometimes looks
orange gold bronze red it has so many
different shifts and if you can find
this at your local Walgreens or wherever
they have Essie near you
then I would pick up a leggy legend
because it is so pretty and I'm going to
wear
a lot for fall this is the soap and
glory rich and faux miss shower jelly
shower and bath body wash I love this
this looks like I barely used it because
I haven't used it yet this is a
brand-new bottle cuz I went through a
big one I keep this in my guest bathroom
because in my shower
I used the L'Occitane almond shower oil
you guys know as my holy grail shower
body wash but Danny loves that too like
he loves it and it's so expensive so
sometimes I like to take a shower in the
guest bathroom and use this this is my
favorite because I feel like people
really like showering in my shower in my
guest shower because of this it says it
has an almond oats and brown sugar scent
and yes it does no you're not gonna
smell like a pancake but it has a
delicious honey almond oh my gosh sugar
read oh my god
I delicious scent that when you are
washing your body you're like I think
they're gonna start selling soap and
glory at Target now no I'm sorry
at Ulta now because they took it out of
Sephora for some crazy reason I don't
know but now I think they're going to
start selling it or they already started
selling it at Ulta and I love this
sucker right here my last favorite has
been the perfume that I've been wearing
a month and it is Gucci Guilty I have
this little guy to share with you this
is their rollerball but it's not a
rollerball which is a main reason why I
wanted to talk to you guys about it it
is a little spray why don't all perfume
companies do this maybe a lot of you
guys are watching right now like hey I
like the rollerball I don't like the
spray so watch your mouth and I'm sorry
if you guys feel that way but I just
love this little spray personally I find
that if I'm wearing or I'm using a
rollerball I go through those tiny
little roller balls so quickly and this
is a mini perfume like just like you
spray a big perfume you have it in a
little in a little in a little spray I
just go chica chica chica and I'm good
to go I love that it's not a rollerball
I love that it's a tiny little spray
Gucci Guilty you do it right so the
packaging is a main reason why I've been
wearing
let's just throw it in my purse and like
splash it on not splash it on spray it
on but besides the packaging the only
thing I don't like is I don't know how
much I have left because it's like a
solid black color but I love the
packaging anyway but besides that this
is such a sexy beautiful nighttime scent
I love it let me read the notes really
quick so it says the top notes are a
mandarin orange and pink pepper middle
notes are geranium peach and lilac and
the base notes are patchouli and amber I
love when fragrances have patchouli in
their base notes because it gives it
like a very sexy like strong independent
woman scent Porter what are you growling
at what are you calling it it's
definitely like a soft spicy but floral
scent at the same time a little bit
sweet I know it has a lot of fruits in
the notes but I find it more like spicy
floral just a little bit fruity not
sweet I meant fruity I love this perfume
it's very sexual in a real liking so
those were my monthly favorites leave me
a comment down below what your all-time
favorite product was this month and
maybe I'll check it out
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
