my monthly favorites video we're gonna
be discussing products I was loving in
September and I have to be completely
honest I don't have groundbreaking
earth-shattering products this month I
just I don't know I kind of have
mentioned this in my recent videos but I
haven't really been feeling myself I'm
in a funk
I'm not really inspired I it's just been
a really anxious September like the
whole month was very anxious for me and
just sad things happened this month and
I'm just not as positive and happy as I
would like to be so hopefully October is
better so even though I feel like I did
try out new products in September I
didn't really use them enough to talk
about them today but the products that I
will be talking about today I do truly
love and I've been using them so much so
I'm just gonna jump right in and
drinking my coffee this is a cup that my
friend America made me has like my
little monogram here and I have been
loving to drink like black coffee with a
little bit of coconut milk delicious but
anyway my first favorite is this hmmm
perfectionist finishing powder this is
in the shade porcelain I bought this on
the H&amp;amp;M website hmmm has makeup now like
their own Beauty line hmmm definitely
has some hits and misses some things are
really good and other things not so good
but I love this this is an extremely
extremely pigmented powder this is in
the shade porcelain which is obviously
like too light too fair for my skin but
I love using this underneath the eyes to
mattify and brighten at the same time
like it mattifies any shininess on your
face but lately I have really been
liking that I've mentioned it about a
hundred times already I'm gonna mention
it again I'm sorry but I have been
having some serious skin issues and I
can't quite put my finger on what
exactly it is I think I might have
Malaysia for leaky tees that's not how
you say it but I need to speak to my
dermatologist to see if maybe that's
what I have I just I don't know I've
been liking more of a matte look to my
skin because my dewy your foundations
will kind of emphasize all the texture
that's going on in my face right now and
I've got lots of texture these days only
been highlighting in the places where I
want the glow but the rest of my face
I've like
it pretty matte and this powder is
awesome it's not too drying or too thick
or chunky or powdery and the powder is
very very pigmented what I love doing
with this is I'll set my under eye
concealer with like my our CMA no color
powder and then I'll take just like a
little setting brush dip it into the
powder and just add this right
underneath my eyes and that really
highlights my face because it is such a
light powder but it's a very pigmented
powder like it has coverage and I just
really like this powder I don't know
it's been my go-to for really
brightening the face in those areas like
in my t-zone underneath my eyes and it's
also mattifying so I don't know I like
it okay so my next product is a pricey
one but I love this so much I've been
using it non-stop literally the whole
month this is the kavanah quan sculpting
powder and this isn't new or anything
but this shade is new this is in the
shade light and this is what it looks
like I have the shade medium which is
this shade right here then this is the
first one they came out with and I
really like this I thought it was really
good until they came out with the shade
light and I loved it way more personally
for my skin tone sometimes when I use
this one it can look a little bit too
grey it looks a little bit too ashy too
muddy
this one is perfect it's the perfect
tone to where it doesn't look too gray
but it is pigmented enough to where it
does carve out the cheeks I have this on
today only I did put on like a warmer
bronzer on top it's just my favorite
contour powder right now it's my go-to
it's so tiny so it just fits easily
anywhere
the only sucky part is that it is tiny
and does suspensive this is a very
pricey contour powder but I love it I
can't deny that and I've been using it
all month I think it is worth the money
because it's so smooth it blends well
and I love the color okay so my next
favorite is an eyeshadow palette that I
didn't think I was gonna love as much as
I do this is the masquerade palette by
the brand julius place love this it's
one of my favorite eyeshadow palettes
honestly I have two tutorials using this
palette already I will link them down
below in case you're interested
I'm using this right now on my eyes
today very simple even though this looks
like an insane crazy colorful palette
you can do everyday looks
with it as well I just used pretty much
all the matte shades here just kind of
put it everywhere got a little bit of a
smudgy look this Giza color is stunning
on the inner corners I love this palette
and it is extremely affordable now I
heard a few things about this brand like
supposedly they had like horrible
customer service I'm not sure I did
purchase this one myself but the other
two like the first two were sent to me
this one I bought with my own money and
it did take a while to ship to me I'm
not gonna lie like it took a little bit
longer than expected but I got here
perfectly fine and the quality is just
so good so I don't know I didn't really
have any bad experiences with this brand
I just have been using it so much this
and another palette that I will talk
about next month I have been using those
two pilots non-stop but I really wanted
to mention this one I know it might be
sold out hopefully I will come back and
stock very soon okay so I got to talk
about this foundation really quick this
is the Urban Decay all nighter
waterproof long-wear liquid foundation I
have been using and abusing this I love
this so much it's the only well no it's
not the only I have used a ton of other
foundations in September but it has been
my goal to especially when I'm doing a
more dramatic look or whenever I just
want something to look good for a really
really long time especially since it has
such a great coverage like I've already
said a hundred times I've been having
some skin issues and it's like this is
the only foundation that covers them I
have a ton of breakouts going on on my
forehead on the side of my face here and
now kind of like around this area i 100%
have to use a really good moisturizer
underneath because if not I will just
cling to on my dryness but if i prime
really well this looks awesome
and it just looks so flawless the only
thing I really really hate about this is
the fact that I have to mix these two
shades
this is 3.0 and 3.25 oh and they also
oxidize that's another major downfall
like you see it oxidizing as you're
applying it to your face which is kind
of bizarre but I have to mix these two
shades because 3.0 once it oxidizes it
is almost a little bit too orange for my
skin and I don't like that and then 3.25
on its own is a little bit too pinky
like I know it's a neutral undertone but
for some reason on me it looks it just
looks off my perfect combination
unfortunately is mixing these two I feel
like you either hate or love this
foundation and I happen to be somebody
who completely loves it at least because
of the issues of having right now with
my skin I just love the coverage okay so
I'm gonna talk about a few lip products
because I've been wearing kind of
minimal make-up this month I have really
been focusing on my lip color I love
throwing on lipstick and just some
mascara and going out the door and of
course I gotta put my eyebrows on
so eyebrows mascara and lipstick and
like bronzer I want concealer
pretty much of always a mango but these
have been the lip products I've been
using a lot I want to talk about this
one really quick because it's not really
a lipstick I mean at all it's not this
is the Milani moisture lock coconut oil
infused lip treatment I love this I used
to talk too much crap about this because
I used to have a raspberry one and I
don't know if it's just because that one
had a tint and it made my lips look a
little bit red and I don't really like
that I don't know that one it just
wasn't my favorite this one is awesome
because it's clear so it looks pretty
much just like a clear gloss on top of
your lips but it's so hydrating and so
moisturizing I love throwing this in my
purse and if I don't have any makeup on
I'll just throw this on my lips and it
doesn't look weird because it's clear
and it smells so good it smells exactly
like a coconut tropical getaway it's so
good the scent is amazing it lingers on
your lips so I feel like I smell the
coconut I really like this when I've
been wearing liquid lipsticks these are
the two that I've been wearing the most
in September this one is the Kylie
cosmetics matte liquid lipstick in the
shade
I have all of them and I haven't tried
any of her like brand spanking new ones
like brown sugar or like some other ones
but this one is my absolute favorite out
of all of the ones that she has the
formula isn't the best I've ever tried I
prefer the Oprah ones or the dose of
colors the GA one's a little bit more
than this but I love the color so much
that I've just been wearing it on me is
looks completely different than it does
on anyone else I've seen it pulls very
Brown on my lips but like a nude Brown a
peachy peachy nude Brown for my
collection it's pretty unique I don't
really have many liquid lipsticks or
many lipsticks that have this undertone
it's what I wore in my recent makeup
tutorial I mean I put a lipstick on top
but that's what I was using and then the
other liquid lipstick I have been using
a lot is the Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lipstick in the shade project
chimps I was browsing the just arrived
section on my Sephora app as I do once a
day and I saw that she came out with
this new color and I do get PR from Kat
Von D but some with PR sometimes you get
new stuff sometimes they don't so
immediately when I saw this color on the
sephora website like I bought it like
instantly I knew it was gonna be a red
that I was going to love and it is I
love it's what I'm wearing on my lips
today I love this shade of red oh my
gosh I just tried to pull it up on the
Sephora app so I could read to you what
the description of this liquid lipstick
said and it says we do not currently
carry the product you requested please
try another search what do you mean I
bought this like three weeks ago was
this limited edition like extremely
limited edition because if it is not I
feel like crap I would definitely check
your local Sephora maybe ask somebody
for this color if you are interested
because I love it so much and actually
when I read the description it's said
that a portion of the proceeds go to
help the chimps which I thought was
really nice so whenever I've wanted to
wear a red lip this month I have been
reaching for a project chimps the only
thing I don't like about this is that I
have to put on two layers like this is
too full layers of this because it is a
very thin formula it's not fully opaque
on one layer I gotta be honest but I
look past that because I just love the
tone of this red but when I haven't been
wearing liquid lipsticks these are the
colors I've been wearing they're both
nudes it's been a very nude month for me
this is a lipstick from the brand soap &amp;amp;
Glory I bought this at CVS no I bought
this at Walgreens and I have no idea
that soap &amp;amp; Glory made its way to
Walgreens now like I walked in and I saw
this huge wall at Walgreens dedicated to
slope angle
and they almost peed my pants I was like
oh my god that's amazing because I used
to sell that at Sephora but now it's
sold at Walgreens this is their sexy
mother pucker lipstick in the shade of
andÃ¶ beige I have been using this so
much it doesn't look like it but I
really really have mainly because I love
the scent of these lipsticks they smell
exactly like a MAC lipstick SEP
delicious vanilla scent only a little
bit more faint like it isn't as strong
as the MAC lipsticks but it's there you
smell that Mac scent but besides that I
really really do like this color it just
goes with everything everything and
anything it is very light has a very
natural finish it's kind of like a satin
finish and it's not extremely pigmented
but it's beautiful it's a nude I like
sheer nudes and I have just been
throwing this on when I want to give my
lips a little bit of color but I still
want to keep it nude and this one is
also a nude but it's a little bit more
glossy a little bit more hydrating on
the lips this is the flower beauty hydra
silk ultimate lip butter in the shade
naked petal so this one is a little bit
darker than the soap &amp;amp; Glory one it is
more pigmented it's a little bit more
hydrating and i just love how this feels
on the lips even when my lips are
chapped this just applies really really
nicely i love this color so much it goes
with so many different eye looks and it
just makes your lips look nice and juicy
i really really really been liking this
okay so in a recent tutorial i had
mentioned that this brush was going to
release next month but yesterday i was
looking at trend moods instagram and i
saw that this was already released which
makes me extremely excited because i
freaking freaking freaking love this
brush i have all of their new
beautifully oh by the way these are
called the beautifully precise that i
spit i think I spent the beautifully
precise brush collection from elf eyes
lips face calm I have all of them and
most of them are really good some of
them I don't care for but this one is
highly recommended by me this is their
smudge brush I call it a pencil brush
because I mean it's a pencil brush but
its name is a smudge brush synthetic so
it's not very scratchy on your lower
lash line which I hate very scratchy
pencil brushes this one's not like that
I love this week
it comes to a very very pointy very
precise tip Oh beautifully precise the
fact that it does come to this point
gets it so easy to get the color really
really really close to your waterline
this is my go-to whenever I want to
smudge out eyeliner on the lower lash
line like if I put an eyeliner on my
waterline and I want it to look really
smoky I'll just take this brush wiggle
it right under there and it just smudges
the eyeliner so nicely and it blends it
out and blows it out it's just awesome I
freaking love this brush and it's only
five bucks they're really good but this
this is my most favorite this has been
like my favorite brow Joe I love this
this is from Givenchy it's this you want
she it's a very pricey brand I know yeah
I do munching it is there mr. Brown room
brow setter I purchased this on the
Sephora website just to throw this into
my luxury makeup hits and misses but I
ended up loving it so much I don't
regret buying this the only thing that
completely sucks is I can already see I
can already see it getting a little bit
goofy and gunky on the inside because
obviously this is a brow gel so I apply
it after I fill in my brows the brown
pigment from my brows gets mixed in with
this brow gel so I am afraid this is
gonna look really ugly here soon but I
have been using it non-stop it's like
the only brow gel I want to use and the
only reason why I think it's worth it
for me personally even though it's just
a clear brow gel a ton of brands make it
this is the only clear brow gel that
keeps my brows up I personally like the
feathery look to the eyebrows
I think brows looks so pretty when
they're just like a feathery and up and
bushy looking and this brow gel does
that for me it keeps them up and in
place all day but it doesn't get crunchy
it doesn't feel like I'm wearing like
hairspray on my brows and I love this
brow gel for that reason I got to give a
shout-out to the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana bourbon perfume I was on the
just arrived section on my Sephora app
when I noticed that Elizabeth and James
added two more sense to their Nirvana
line they have the Nirvana white perfume
which I don't like at all actually and
then they have the Nirvana black perfume
which I love I own that one
and then I saw that they came out with
two more sense which is nirvana bourbon
and then they came out with Nirvana rose
I believe it's like a pinky color I'm
not sure I haven't smelled that one yet
just because I don't really love the
scent of roses
I bought this specifically to take with
me to New York you guys know I always
buy new scents whenever I'm traveling to
a new place and I'm so happy I picked
this one up almost everyone at my
meet-up at Jen Beauty was complimenting
me on how I smelled like so many of you
who came up to me and hugged me we're
like oh my god she smells so good you
guys smelled really good too by the way
but a lot of you guys were telling me
that I had smelled so good and it was
this and I was really shocked because I
was sweating like a pig that day on both
days because I was so nervous so the
fact that so many people were
complimenting me on the way that I
smelled made me so happy
the notes on the Sephora website say
vanilla bourbon Oakwood and tuberose oh
my god it reminds me so much of New York
it's so funny and I reminds me of when I
smelled it like I think of all of my
subscribers which is so nice it smells
very strong in my opinion and very
woodsy musky it actually lasts a pretty
good time on my skin
there has been some mixed reviews about
this specific scent but I personally I
really like it so yes a a plus okay so
that completes this video these were
products I've really been loving in the
month of September I hope you guys had
an amazing September and I hope you guys
