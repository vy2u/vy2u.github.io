my September favorites I was honestly
gonna say me that's how off I am that's
how I but it is September its September
my nose is still really stuffy so please
excuse my voice and I'm just gonna get
into it I'm gonna show you all the
products I've been loving this month
some of these I've been using more
towards the end of the month I'm not
gonna lie just because at the beginning
of the month
with the whole hurricane happening this
month and coming back to no power and it
was a lot going on I wasn't really
wearing makeup the beginning of this
month that much I don't have like a ton
of new exciting like innovative cool
amazing things but I have been loving
all of these products and I really
wanted to talk about them so let's get
started so I want to give a quick shout
out to the colour-pop no filter
concealer I have been using this a lot
especially in September when I left to
Mississippi I had completely forgotten
to pack my makeup I was I just packed my
clothes my dogs when I left but I
completely forgot that I had a bag in my
bag already that had this concealer I'm
usually like neutral but in the bag I
had light I had a face mist mascara at
an eyebrow product so I only used this
while I was in Mississippi and I had a
lot of restless nights while I was over
there and this really helped this is
such a good concealer especially for the
price it's like six dollars and you get
really great coverage it lasts a really
long time and it does increase that
badly it creases just a little bit but a
little goes a long way and I just love
how it makes the under eyes look it's
the concealer I'm wearing underneath my
eyes today I also love mixing it with my
Tarte shape tape but I have been wearing
it a lot on its own they're like it's
becoming one of my favorite affordable
concealers hands down it just gives me
good coverage without drying out my
under eyes but yet it still manages to
stay kind of matte and flawless looking
without being too much you know and the
more I use it the more I like it like
the first time I used it I liked it but
now that I use it more often and
comparing it to other concealers I
really like it and I really like the
shade they do oxidize but I find that
they oxidize immediately like within a
minute it's already as dark as it's
gonna get so I have really been enjoying
this concealer it just makes my skin
look so smooth and almost perfect but
not too perfect you know good stuff okay
so this product I just quickly want to
mention because its back
I never thought I'd see this day again
do you guys know that whenever I apply
my foundation eight times out of ten I'm
using a Beauty Blender or a damp sponge
to apply it but if I am using a brush
this is the brush I always use you guys
see me use this a ton and it is the it
cosmetics love is the foundation brush
it is so good there's something about
this brush but I love way more than all
my other foundation brushes I can't even
explain it it's just the perfect density
it's so incredibly soft it buffs in the
foundation it's amazing it just makes
the skin look so nice not streaky at all
it really just applies foundation
perfectly I don't know what it is it's
amazing but it was limited edition and
it came out um I think last year in
October for breast cancer awareness but
they brought it back and if you buy this
brush any time during the month of
October which is Breast Cancer Awareness
Month it cosmetics will actually donate
one of these brushes I'm like reading it
off the Ulta website because I had
forgotten but it cosmetics will actually
donate one of these brushes to the
American Cancer Society's look good feel
better program to help women face the
effects of cancer with confidence so
when you buy one of these brushes they
give one away to a woman who's dealing
with that and I think that is amazing so
I'm really excited to see if it's the
exact same brush I know that the
packaging is different now the new one
has like pink sparkles on it which I'm
really excited about but hopefully it's
like the exact same brush because it's
so incredibly good highly recommend it
and I highly recommend you checking it
out if you're looking for a foundation
brush it's my favorite for a reason it's
so good okay so blush I have been using
only like very recently but I love this
blush and I have to say I don't love
Burt's Bees makeup in general I know
they just came out with a ton of stuff I
don't like the eyeshadows the more I use
them I just I don't like them they're a
little bit too muted for me they don't
have that much pigmentation but I really
really love this blush this is in the
shade bear peach it's just a regular old
peach blush but I just love how it has
kind of like a soft Sheen to it
but nothing that's too noticeable yeah
it just gives your cheeks a little bit
of like a luminous flush it's very
minimal but it's so pretty
I just really love peach blushes I mean
I feel like I'm always talking about
peach blushes on my
they're my favorite because I think they
do pair well with really warm looks but
I also love them with like cool tone
looks I love a cool tone I was like a
pop of peach on the cheeks
it's the blush I'm wearing on my face
right now and I just absolutely love it
I have been using it non-stop ever since
I got it and I cannot put it down which
is why I wanted to mention it to you
guys because it has become one of my
favorite blushes like ever ever I don't
know what it is about it I just I love
it I have to give a quick shout out to
the Too Faced just peachy mattes palette
it's what's on my eyes right now it's
what I've been wearing a lot this month
there's just so many mats to choose from
and I love my eyeshadows they're just so
natural and honestly like these are the
type of looks I do on a daily basis just
a few matte shades something natural but
that really makes your eyes stand out so
I love that they have these dark shades
to really like intensify the look and
then all these natural shades for
everyday I just really like this
probably I think it's very good it
smells amazing can't smell it right now
cuz I'm super stuffy but it does smell
amazing and I've been using it non-stop
actually have a tutorial using this
palette up on my channel it's like the
matte peach smokey eye I have been
loving it it's really good quality and
they blend really well and there was
actually somebody who commented on my
recent video asking me like man does
that palette look like the elf matte
format - palette when I read that I was
like BBB
oh my god it does I wouldn't say they're
dupes but let me show you how right here
this is the matte format - palette one
of elf's best creations right here it's
such a good palette and it's so
affordable now you can see how they're
obviously different the elf one has more
dusty shades they're not as peachy or as
vibrant it's a little bit more neutral
you know it's not as peachy and warm but
I feel like you can kind of get similar
looks with this you have this dark
purple and then you have like this
orange e shade and this light pink like
I said they're not dupes but if you have
been wanting to try this and you just
don't want to buy it for one reason or
another you might want to check out the
elf matte format - palette because you
can get such a beautiful all matte look
with this palette as well so color pop
released a ton of pressed powder or like
face products they came out with pressed
powder highlights
and pressed powder bronzers now this
bronzer is called private party there's
one thing I don't like about this
packaging is that the actual name of the
bronzer is not on this packaging it's
just like on the cardboard packaging
that this comes in which actually isn't
a big deal unless you make youtube
videos I guess but I just took off the
sticker that was on the unit cart and
then I popped it right here so I
remember this one is private party but
anyway I love private party and I like
it so much more than I thought I would
a lot of the bronzes are very warm but
this one is like beautiful I love it it
also has a warm undertone but not as
orange it kind of has like a more suntan
kind of warm undertone to it and I know
I say this like a hundred times in every
video but it has a slight sheen to it
this has a little bit of like gold and
glitter all throughout this bronzer but
when you blend it all together and you
apply it to the skin it just gives you
the most beautiful bronze like actual
bronze glow to the face because it's not
too much and it's not like actual chunks
of glitter you know macary fine golden
that used to be my favorite bronzer in
high school like my senior year in high
school and I wore it all the time but
that one actually has like glitters in
it this reminds me so much of Mac refine
golden and don't hold me to that because
I haven't used that bronzer in like two
years so I don't remember what that
looks like but this reminds me of that
like when I put it on I feel like I'm
getting refined golden without the
actual glitters in it it just kind of
looks like a sheen if the bronzer I'm
wearing on my skin right now whenever I
apply this I just feel like I'm
instantly getting tanner like it doesn't
look like bronzer it looks like my skin
is like actually tan I love this and I'm
so sad I didn't discover this like in
the beginning of this summer because I
feel like this would have been my go-to
bronzer all summer it's just such a
pretty undertone and I love the look it
gives the skin so I've been using this a
lot so I wanna talk about a foundation
and I know what you guys are thinking
like oh my gosh she's gonna talk about
the two-faced peach foundation but I'm
not while I have been loving the peach
foundation and I've been wearing it a
lot I have been wearing this one even
more like throughout the entire month
which is weird because I haven't really
been wearing it in videos but I love
this foundation this is the milk makeup
blur liquid I have been using it
since the first day they sent it to me I
want to say use it in a video or did I
or maybe I wanted to and then I I didn't
get around to it but this is such a
great foundation for so many reasons
this is Matt okay it's a matte
foundation but it does not look Matt I
don't know any explaining it that sounds
so stupid but I it looks so gorgeous
like it looks matte without drying out
my skin without looking like I have a
thick mat layer of foundation on my face
you know it looks beautiful I don't know
how it does it but it gives you really
full coverage without putting a mask on
your face obviously I always go in with
a super hydrating primer like today I
went in with moisturizer a dewy face
mist and then I went in with this
foundation just because I have very dry
skin but I find that when I do that it
still works for me if you have to
moisturize a little bit around my nose
because sometimes it will sink into
though like you know this part of your
nose and it gets a little crusty but
it's beautiful in between my brows which
is another trouble area for me and it
doesn't cling on to the dryness there
and it lasts all day on my skin every
time I wear this foundation right before
I'm about to wash it off I'm like wow I
love how this makes my skin look and
it's very rare for me to say that at the
end of the day so I really really have
been liking this so this was the other
product I took with me to Mississippi
this is the elf Beauty shield
antioxidant enriched skin protection
it's their daily defense makeup mist I
was using this non-stop in Mississippi I
think I used this like 10 times a day
I'm not even kidding this is supposed to
be a fine facial mist that's formulated
with key antioxidant licorice extract
and vitamin E for a nourishing layer of
Defense that helps protect your skin
against everyday environmental
aggressors and I wanted to talk about
this in my face mist video but I
couldn't find it anywhere and I finally
found it today underneath like Danny's
side of the bathroom like under his part
of the sink which is so weird because I
don't put things there and put things on
my side but I like how calming this is
on the skin I don't think it's anything
like crazy amazing different and special
but I have been using it all up this
month which is why I wanted to tell you
guys about it I like how it smells I
like how it feels on the skin it's very
hydrating but it's not sticky and the
mist isn't like the best or anything but
I find that when you just spray up and
then put your face into it it works
wonders like
beautiful leaves your skin looking a
little bit dewy and very very hydrated
and it kind of feels moisturizing on the
skin but it doesn't leave your face
sticky like I said or it doesn't give
you a greasy feeling so I have really
been liking this one and itself so it's
really inexpensive and I mean it has
good ingredients in this product so that
it's a win-win another thing I used this
for I know this sounds really weird but
whenever I felt really really anxious or
like on the verge of a panic attack
I noticed that settings brace really
calmed me down I would kind of like
stand outside when we left to
Mississippi and I would just spray this
on my face and just like stand there in
the Sun and breathe in take like a
really deep breath and breathe out and I
don't know if it was like the coolness
of the face mist or the fact that I like
spraying water on my face it just kind
of calms me down and like brought me
back in the sense was super calming as
well I really I can't smell life but I
really like how it kind of like and I
know that that's weird and never a
reason to buy something but if you
already have a setting spray try that
trick out ok I have to talk about this I
love this I've only been using it for a
little while but I absolutely love this
if you are an hourglass fan if you're a
high end fan and you really like to just
indulge in makeup and like splurge in it
you need this you need this this is the
hourglass ambient metallic strobe
lighting palette the only thing I don't
like about this is that I feel like this
would only work for those of you with
light medium to very fair skin tones I
hope they come out with one that targets
medium to deep skin tones because this
will just be way too light so I really
hope they release that in the future
just so everyone can try this out but I
absolutely love this freakin formula it
is so good this isn't like they're
regular ambient lighting powders I have
this one that's just their regular
ambient lighting palette that looks like
this
all these powders although they're a
little bit highlighting and luminous
they're more just finishing powders this
they actually made strobing highlights
and to me they are way better than the
ones they came out with that released in
singles I don't know if these are like
the same thing only in one palette maybe
I misjudged
other ones but I feel like these are
just way better today on my face I have
a mixture of these two highlights it's
mainly this one but on the very top of
the cheekbone I did add this golden
shade and I loved it it looks so
beautiful on the cheeks but what I love
about these is although they're very
highlighting because they are they
highlight your face you know you get
that metallic look they are extremely
natural they're not frosty or glittery
or like wow that looks like extremely
fake you know it's not that kind of
highlight melts right into your skin
like it sinks right into the skin it
doesn't emphasize texture at all
it looks so smooth yet very glowy it's I
love this palette so so much I think
it's personally worth the splurge worth
the money because it is such a beautiful
highlighter and I feel like anybody will
love this formula if you're looking to
splurge on a highlighting product this
is a good one earlier in this month la
girl sent me a package that had a few
things in it and they came out with
these ultimate lip intense stay auto
liners they're just lip liners and I
have been using this shade non-stop nude
a lot it's a really pretty nude cuz it's
a dark nude but it's not too deep it has
a really great undertone to pair with so
many different nude lipsticks on top you
know it's not too much of anything and I
actually really like these lip liners
from la girl they're super affordable
and very very creamy they remind me a
lot of like a high-end brand I just
can't put I can't think of it I don't
know definitely check these out on the
la girl website they have a ton of
different colors and they're just so
creamy and so comfortable to wear and
then I also want to give a huge shout
out to this nude this is gorgeous I love
this this is the new girl lactic I think
it's new it's the matte lip paint in the
shade spice I feel like I haven't spoken
about curl lactic liquid lipsticks in a
while but they make one of my favorite
formulas like definitely top 5 they're
so comfortable to wear and they last all
day and this color in spice is just so
beautiful and perfect for fall because
it's it's literally like the perfect
fall nude because it has a little bit of
that spicy undertone so pretty perfect
for like really warm smoky eyes I just I
really like this color and I highly
recommend it I've also been wearing I
think the shade called Sahara but of
course I can't
anywhere I've looked everywhere for that
shame at work the other day I don't know
what I lose everything it's not like an
arrow sign thing I think it is I feel
like we lose everything but anyway I
have been loving that and then last but
not least I just wanted to give a little
shout-out to my little Mondeo whole
necklace it's like the little evil eye
