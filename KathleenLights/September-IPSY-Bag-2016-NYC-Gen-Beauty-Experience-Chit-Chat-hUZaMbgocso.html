all about that it's vague I'm gonna
unbag it in this video so a lot of guys
have been telling me you are liking the
way I'm doing my unboxings now I did it
with my boxy charm and I also did it and
I also did it with my Ipsy bag last
month I just feel like I want to make my
unboxings a little bit more entertaining
or a little bit more useful so I like to
try on the products as I go before I
would kind of just unbox everything and
then when I was done filming I would
kind of do my makeup with it and insert
clips but I feel like if I do it as I am
filming I can give you my thoughts
initially like right then and there the
only thing with that is that I'm not
like super surprised because I already
know what's inside the boxes or the bags
you know what I mean so I did take a
peek of what is inside I haven't opened
anything I haven't swatched or felt
anything so it's still a first
impression I just peeked in saw more or
less what I got and then did my makeup
according to what was in here
you know you guys know what I mean I
don't know why I'm explaining cuz you
cuz you know so yeah before I get into
my Ipsy bag I just want to give you guys
a quick chitchat about New York City I
will leave right here at timestamp so
you can fast forward if you do not give
a rat's ass about my experiences in New
York or be talking about New York Way if
you're like I don't care then no problem
I hear you fast forward this video and I
will put the time right here where the
actual unbagging starts because I didn't
want to sit down and thank you guys for
going to Gen Beauty and I thought what
better video to throw it in the nipsey
video because my unboxings are so short
this one's gonna be long though so I
just really wanted to say thank you to
everyone who went out to Gen Beauty on
Friday and Saturday Saturday and Sunday
it really was amazing meeting so many of
you I was at the Oprah booth from 2:30
to 4:00 o'clock on both days I had a
meet-up both days it was really really
amazing and I'm so glad that I did that
because the trip to New York had me
really really really anxious I don't
want this video to be too long I don't
want to go into too many details but we
got there Wednesday night and then on
Thursday it was a great day we spent me
and Dani we went to Starbucks in the
morning and then we walked around
Central Park and I thought I was in a
movie I swear I felt like I was in a
movie
I see Central Park so much on TV
and it was so cool to actually be there
I hadn't never been to New York before
it was my first time and it was amazing
Central Park is so much bigger than I
thought it was I was like kid in a candy
store in Central Park I loved it but
then after that we wanted to go to
ground zero and we wanted to see the
9/11 memorial like that was really
important to us to go and see it and
when I got there holy crap I cannot
explain it to you
seeing everything gave me so much
anxiety I was kind of like walking
around and reading everything and
looking at all the pictures and my heart
was just like dhanananda I couldn't
explain it
I felt I don't even know I don't know
how to explain it going to that is like
reliving 9/11 all over again it's just
so incredibly sad they show a lot of
footage and videos they show text
messages from people like voicemails
from people who are affected during that
time and you can just feel the sadness
and the anxiety and the panic just
reading and watching all of that it made
me feel so sad I don't know it's it is a
beautiful beautiful memorial and I
really love how they have all the names
of the victims you know so they never
forgot it and it was really nice to go
and see but it put me like on edge and
the feeling kind of stayed there like in
my soul for the rest of my trip on
Friday we just kind of walked around New
York City and holy crap if you live in
New York City how do you not like
there's so many people it is so
fast-paced I mean it is magical it is a
magical city but it's so it's so intense
I was like scared tip of it to people
and then people like bump into you and
like not even notice so just keep
walking and you're like sorry I'm sorry
I wanted to go to Times Square and
actually we were driving down Times
Square and the driver was like here it
is this is Times Square and I was like
oh I'm not getting off the car there was
so many people and I don't know if it
was a busy weekend I guess New York
Fashion Week or was that last week I'm
not sure but there were a lot of people
or maybe it's always like that but I was
kind of nervous but I didn't want to get
off my car because I thought I would
have a panic attack in the middle of
Times Square and that wasn't gonna be
pretty one thing that is really really
cool about New York I feel it's that's
probably the best place to vlog at
sometimes I hate vlogging because I feel
like I'm being judged by people like are
you talking to your camera or but in New
York like you can vlog and nobody would
notice I feel like you could be naked on
a unicycle juggling and no one would
notice everyone's just my
their own business just trying to get to
where they're going like no one cares
what you're doing that's pretty freakin
awesome
that's not like that in Miami people
stare at you if you're doing something
they're just like staring at you with
judgment but anyway and then I was
really really like extra nervous for
Saturday and Sunday I get so nervous
during meetups like oh my gosh no idea
but you guys are so awesome and nice and
it really did calm down my anxiety but
actually the first day of Jen beauty
which was Saturday as soon as I got in
my Oberer to leave back to the hotel
thank God it happened after but as soon
as I got into my uber I lost my vision
on my right eye and that happens to me
sometimes it had it happened in a few
months but I suffer from really really
really bad migraines and it causes me to
lose my vision for a little bit I've
gone to eye doctors brain doctors head
doctors I've gone to all of that and
everyone tells me it's just a migraine
but as soon as I got in my burr I
noticed that and I was like oh my god
I'm about to get a really horrible
migraine and 20 minutes later it hit me
like a rock and it was probably the
worst migraine I've ever had in my life
we went back to the hotel room and I was
like crying in the bed for like two
hours my head hurt so bad if you suffer
migraines I trust me I know it sucks
there's like nothing you can do
I took excedrin and it did nothing I ate
I tried to like take it away but just
time and tears took it away and then
once I felt a little bit better after I
had eaten I really wanted to go to the
benefit dinner because benefit was
hosting like this murder mystery dinner
and I wanted to see all my youtube
friends cuz I didn't get a chance to
hang out with them during the day at Jen
Beauty so I went and it was a lot of fun
I was there with Casey Tess and then
like a bunch of youtubers but those are
the people I was sitting around so big
people I was hanging out with the most
and the dinner was actually in Chelsea
in New York and we were three blocks
away from the bomb that went off and as
soon as I heard the news I freaked out
like I went into panic mode and I tried
I tried not to pull a kathleen because i
was in front of so many bloggers and
youtubers and I didn't want to form a
show in front of these people I would
just look at Danny with like my eyes
like wide open he's like calm down relax
I wanted to leave I wanted to just go
back to my hotel room there were streets
that were blocked off and I felt so bad
because I was you know sitting talking
to Casey and you know we were just
talking to
life and I love Casey seriously Casey
Holmes is awesome we're just sitting
down talking and my mind just kept going
to like the TV they had like the news on
the TV and I just kept looking at the
news and looking at the news and I tried
to focus and just like not panic but I
couldn't help it horrible anxiety as
soon as we left we left pretty early I
was like I have to get out of here as
soon as we left I was like crying in the
car panic attack it was so scary that it
happened so close to us thankfully
nobody died from the explosion thank you
so much there were a few people who were
injured I think like 25 but no deaths
thank God and it just caught me off
guard so much that the next day when I
went to wake up to go to Jenn Beauty on
Sunday I almost didn't go I could I
can't explain to you the panic like in
my chest like I did not want to go I
didn't want to leave my hotel room I
just want to stay there until I had to
go home and I was so close to not going
so close and I'm again I don't I get
emotional but when I got there on Sunday
there was a girl she was actually the
first girl in line she told me that she
came all the way from Israel and then I
immediately felt like pure dog when
I left on Sunday I had told Danny I'm
like can you imagine if I wouldn't have
gone like I would have disappointed her
I mean I would have disappointed
everybody but I this girl came from
Israel like I would have disappointed
her so much and just the thought of that
made me feel so bad like I almost let my
anxiety get in the way from meeting my
subscribers and thankfully I went you
know I pushed my feelings all the way to
the back of my head and I was like no
I'm gonna meet my friends I met and I
hugged so many of you and that's also
what I want to say in this video thank
you so much for sharing your stories
with me
I really hate meetups at the same time
because you can only be with someone for
like 40 seconds and then they have to
leave you know they make you go you
don't want to make people wait in line
for so long which I understand I hate
when people have to wait in line for me
like that I don't like that at all but
then at the same time I don't I don't
want to make people leave so fast I wish
I could have stayed with each and every
one of you individually like longer
because we were talking about so many
things and I just wanted to hear more
stories but I just wanted to say thank
you for those of you who came up to me
sharing your anxiety stories with me
saying that I helped you like you guys
make me so happy I feel like I can't
believe I helped people with their
anxiety I am such an emotional wreck
I am so unstable like my anxiety always
gets the best
of me so when people tell me that I help
them with their anxiety it blows my mind
and it makes me feel so much better
thank you for being so sweet to me I'm
sorry you had to wait in a line I hear I
felt so happy for the hour and a half
Saturday and Sunday when I was really
anxious on my trip after we left on
Sunday I went to go have dinner with one
of my YouTube friends Rosita if you
follow her Rosita Appelbaum she is
awesome I connect on her and such an
emotional level I feel like she is so
down-to-earth so real I freaking love
her so much so we went to this
restaurant called the Smith and let me
tell you something I had the best
avocado tacos I've ever had in my life
if you live in New York or if you're in
New York City it's like in Manhattan
pretty sure because it was like three
blocks away from my hotel and I ordered
it without cheese obviously I'm not
eating dairy but even without the cheese
it was perfection the best avocado tacos
ever seriously ever and then the next
day we went to the airport and they were
still looking for the guy that was um
responsible for the bomb and that was
just really like oh my god I had my
throat in my butthole the entire time
that I was in the airport and my plane
was delayed eight hours I was supposed
to leave at 11 a.m. and I ended up
leaving at 7 p.m. it was just
frustrating but so happy to be home and
happy to start filming again I know this
week videos have been kind of boring but
I will jump into tutorials and jump into
more fun stuff I'm gonna be doing a
battle of the foundation sticks I'm
going to do two videos I'm going to do a
drugstore version and a high-end version
with you know drugstore foundation
sticks and then high-end foundation
sticks because I feel like foundation
sticks are so popular right now so that
video is coming up if you have any
requests for specific videos leave them
down below I'm also working on doing a
room tour and a makeup collection
updated all that stuff I'm working on it
so yeah okay all right so this is what
the bag looks like this month I actually
do like this bag at first I was like
what is happening there but I like it's
like little dancing women I think it's
cute so the first thing in the bag is
this blue thing right here this is from
the brand Aiko London and this is their
I do liquid eyeliner and it's like a
mini version of their eyeliner or their
liquid liner waterproof lash enhancing
and it's in carbon black lash enhancing
oh this is like
fad Chubby's no I don't know if I'm in
like this I kind of prefer more of a
fine felt-tip this is more of a thicker
fatter felt tip well I'm going to try it
out anyway by the way I have been
watching rain a lot at CW show I don't
know did it get canceled I feel like
what's happening there but I'm almost
done with season two and I don't know
what I was thinking
I don't want Mary and bash together I'm
completely over that I do totally love
Conde at least where I am right now I
love him so much but then I also really
love Francis it's really hard I don't
know
you
okay so even though I don't really love
the style of the pen I like that it's so
mad I'm not sure if you can tell but it
goes on very very black and very matte
which I really really like it is a
little bit drier than I'm used to so I
have a feeling this might dry out pretty
quickly but it's a sample size it might
not be too bad
and actually feels pretty dry trying to
do the wing
okay I'm not even going to attempt to do
like a super sharp wing because like I
said ten times this is a little chubby
for a sharp wing this is already getting
a little too dry for me okay so I think
I might have gotten a dry one cuz that
was a little bit of a struggle
I felt like I had to keep going back
into the cap or like shaking it up to
get a lot of pigment that's the first
time I use that so a little strange next
thing is this little guy right here was
this oh yes I had seen this earlier okay
well mmm this is the two-faced lip
injection extreme this is like a little
sample size of it I have actually
mentioned these once in a disappointing
products video I believe I personally
don't love this oh my gosh this one is
like what color is this this does not
have a shade it almost looks duochrome e
in the bottle but I think it's just like
their clear color I'm gonna go ahead and
give this one to my mom because she's a
psychopath who actually likes these
I'm just getting smells really good if
you like maybe this one is different
from the one I've tried I kind of want
to test it out I try to this once and it
burned the absolute crap out of my lips
like on an insane level I came out with
like a pink shade of purple shade and
all those and I tried those out but this
lip injection extreme I don't know if
this this one I've tried
and obviously extreme probably means
that it's more intense but you know what
for the sake of this video I'm gonna put
it on my mouth let's take off my lip
stick comes get
okay let's see how long that lasts on
cuz I'm already showing it's real it so
next thing in the bag is dis this is
right here this is the eyes by to go spa
green tea eyes the energy drink for your
face aka the dark circle warrior oh nice
three under-eye treatments with collagen
amino acids and vitamins yes yes and yes
so I've never tried these out before
I've kind of used something similar to
this I do like the ones I've tried in
the past they feel really hydrating
underneath the eyes I'm probably gonna
do this later on tonight I feel like my
face needs a nice pamper session nice
hydration it's so dry right now with
like all the skin is she was mama's been
having so I'm really excited to try
these out and this is actually a pretty
decent size for Ipsy like three separate
treatments that's pretty good update on
the lips I don't think they're as bad as
the other one I had their full size and
all their different colors they're like
brand new and I tried the nude one on
and it was unbearable this isn't so bad
and it says extreme I don't know okay
this one this is the event hydrating
serum it is hyper all adrenix
non-comedogenic and it is for sensitive
skin I really really like this brand
because I have sunset of skin myself I
think that these little samples are
perfect to travel with like I prefer
taking something like this on vacation
versus like my full-size product so this
is nice I'm actually gonna hide this one
away once I figure out what's going on
with my skin
then I'll dump it to some skin care I
don't want to irritate my skin even
though it's for sensitive skin I don't
want to use this just yet but I will be
keeping this because I really do like
this brand this is from a brand called
Serafina botanicals and this is their
guava butter 91 percent natural creamy
lip and cheek stain if you like my lips
are numb feel like they never truly
burned they just went completely numb
hmm okay well okay this is what it looks
like guava butter let's watch this okay
it's not too scary it doesn't look as
dark as it does in the tube still let's
see how this blends
I'm so nervous to put this on my cheeks
feels kind of greasy just a little bit
do my lips look bigger too
every time I see really big lips or if I
like overdraw my lips and I try to do
like a pouty lip I always think of mrs.
toad from Thumbelina because she got
like that big juicy lips
I know chotto is like the voice of the
frog and it's like supposed to be like
looking like chattel but that's what I
think of okay I'm gonna use this honest
Beauty buffing brush and I'm going to
top some of these on zebra and then I'm
going to tap some on the back of my hand
you know to be on the safe side
what do you think does it look a little
patchy here I feel like in my mirror it
looks a little patchy you guys think I
don't think it looks bad actually
actually think it looks nice and I kind
of fresh-faced I obviously didn't apply
too much and I think it does look nice I
think it looks really really natural
which I like I'm gonna try it out on my
lips now so let me just take this off
and honestly I think that this does make
your lips look bigger like I feel like
it does right I have kind of like a
small top lip but I think it does make
it look a little bigger but I honestly
it's because your lips get so irritated
that they like swallow up and you can
kind of tell on the outside parts of
your lips like it irritates them and
like swells your lips up therefore
making your lips look big and juicy so
I'm gonna try this out on my lips I'm
just gonna okay so I actually really
like it on my lips I like the hydrating
feel it gives my lips and I really like
the color it's in the shade pure guava
and yeah that's it so guys that was
everything I got in this month's epsy
bag I will leave the names of the
products down below and next to it I
will have what it cost as a full size
product because some of these are full
size but some of these are not so yeah
