a pizza is it so my healthy when you
order it with a bunch of vegetables on
top because that's what I did
hey guys so today's video is going to be
my tips to buy boxing it's a bag but you
get why they're my Ipsy bag get here
solely I even had an issue with my Ipsy
bag last month but it is Thursday the
24th it's like almost October rent baked
and checked now it's time for delivery
we put it in the a twin I had to take
the top of the website off anyway it is
it's almost October and now is when I
get my FC bag but whatever it's okay
let's open it all three dogs are here
today okay so this is well this is the
card look at desi looking very sexual
likey
so this what the bag looks like this one
I really like the bag I really like why
am I feeling on this bag by the way um I
will have the prices of everything
listed below a lot of these products are
not full size so I'm not sure how much
they really are but I will have the
product details down below and how they
how much they cost as a full size item
does that make sense
okay this is Debbie this is the first
thing I saw in the box it's called
trust-fund beauty I'm guessing that is
the name of the brand
I really wish if she would just give me
a description on these cards it is a
nail polish in a beautiful color this is
like a dusty purple I really really love
this color I love getting nail polishes
in my bags or my boxes a lot of you guys
don't you guys tell me you hate it but I
love it I'm like a nail polish border
and I really like this color I've never
heard of the brand trust fund Beauty but
hopefully it's a long wearing nail
polish so so buddy next thing in the bag
is this little trio by the way this is
full size so that's a good start is this
little trail from NYX and he says Oh on
keto says if see and NYX I guess like
NYX teamed up with oopsy to create this
palette
oh my god I guess they created like a
cute little trail together this is it
so this it has like a black a brown like
a shimmery color let's swatch them this
one like has this one for some reason
has like no pigmentation at all like
watch like maybe I could use that was
fixed plus I don't know let's swatch the
okay this one has more pigmentation
right there that's the middle shade and
then this is the dark shade right there
so not terrible not the best this first
shade is not very good but the other two
I'm sure with fix+ can be used so that
is really pretty I think it's kind of
cool that they like collab do on a plane
so next sing easy books I'm pretty sure
that's full size maybe so we actually
really like this brand this is the okay
I'm not gonna say that ravine of na oh
my gosh I'm sorry it is a little like
deluxe sample I don't know why it but
it's like bright that's so weird it's a
deluxe sample of the soothing moisture
mask it says it's for sensitive skin
that's awesome I'm really excited to try
this soothing moisture mask I actually
really like that brand so I'm hoping I
like it so far so far like I mean it's
little but you can get probably like
three uses out of this maybe I have to
see and the next thing in my bag is a
lipstick and this is for sure a
full-size lipstick it's from the brand
city color and city call yeah this is in
the shade one nightstand
we're skinny okay so oh and leg is that
goner I like is that good I know I
typically try on this product but I have
a red liquid lipstick on and I wasn't
planning on filming this video because
my lips if I really just got here like
not that long ago and I already had my
makeup on but I'm going to swatch it on
the back of my hand
next month won't be this way
promise I promise this is what it looks
watched on my hand
that's really pretty that's such a
pretty berry shade
I love these shades on like dark skin
tones like deeper skin tones I love it
so yes I think city color is like a very
affordable brand like a drugstore brand
but I'm not sure where you can get city
color actually so that's cool that
that's in the books in the back and then
the last thing in the bag I'm keeping
that bag I love it is this thing right
here and it is from the brand my nose so
is T it is from the brand temp to which
I think temp 2 is I can be making this
up but I think time 2 is like though Shh
right if you didn't know what that was I
was I called airbrush makeup 10 - right
I think so and it says it's their
champagne Shh am pane yeah champagne
shimmer don't tell me I need a temp to
machine to use this here are five ways
to shine with our SH oh this is pretty
big but yeah you see this goes in a temp
to a thing like this it says place a
couple of drops on your fingertips and
lightly dab on the apples of the cheeks
blending towards the temple okay I don't
need a machine good cuz I don't have one
apply a drop to a lip gloss oh that
would be really cool or use on your body
oh okay so this is the color this is
probably something I rather mix in with
foundation cuz it's pretty dark at least
for my skin skin tone to be a highlight
on me as you can see but that's really
stunning let me see let me blend it
better see it's like a very pinky toned
like a rose gold that's really nice but
that wouldn't be a highlight on me I'm
too fair for that but it doesn't feel
bad like this might be a really good
thing to mix in with foundation okay so
that was everything I got in this
month's FC bag I will list products
below with prices we got two full-size
products actually I don't know if this
is full-size maybe it is it's pretty big
actually I don't think this is full-size
but two full-size products that's
awesome
this lipstick is beautiful really
stunning for the Fall I love berry
shades like this and you can't go wrong
with nail polish so overall I'm happy
with this bag I'm really excited to try
this face mask the only thing I'm like
about to be completely honest is this
because the pigmentation was a little
bit lackluster for me like this first
one is not pigmented at all I don't
understand yeah I really do love if see
that's why I continue to pay for it um
and you guys really like my Ipsy videos
