all about makeup setting sprays you guys
have been asking me to post this video
for weeks now I know I know I'm so late
on this but today's videos another
episode in my makeup stash series we're
gonna go through my setting sprays I
know I just recently decluttered them if
you saw that random rambles video and I
spoke about all of them briefly in that
video I got rid of a ton of them I'm
gonna give you my reviews but I'm gonna
talk about everything mainly the spray
nozzle I feel like that is a
deal-breaker for a lot of people I know
it is for me and the spray is very
important on a setting spray so I'm
gonna touch base on that and I'm also
gonna show you guys like the mist on all
of them all that good stuff so today is
just makeup setting spray talk I know
that can be a little boring but if
you're like me if anyone out there is
like me and loves setting sprays this
videos for you I can't get enough of
setting 3 it's just something about a
bottle and like I don't know I just love
the whole experience of setting my face
now I do have a ton of them so I wanted
to break this video up in two videos
these are just the high end setting
sprays if you want to see a drugstore
version of this video leave a comment
down below and I'll definitely do that
for you guys now some of these I use in
different ways like some of these I use
strictly to set my face some of them I
use them like skincare almost but anyway
I'll talk about it as I go on and if you
are a setting spray collector like me
well let's get into it so I'm gonna
start off with the spray that beats all
sprays when it comes to the nozzle on
this like the mist it has the best mist
out of all the setting sprays I'm gonna
talk about well there's another one
that's just as good in a different way
though I'll talk about later but this is
the cover effects illuminating setting
spray there are major cons to this but
holy crap this is the best spray ever
it's an illuminating setting spray I
thought that meant it was gonna be very
very dewy and just leave your skin like
looking a little wet but this has
shimmer in it this has actual shimmer in
the bottle and you definitely 1,000%
have to shake this up before you use it
because if you do not shake this you
will have giant spots of glitter all
over your face that is not a good look I
don't love it for that reason I don't
like having little shimmers on my face
if you shake it up really
you can avoid it a little as long as you
extend your arm out really far and you
don't apply too much but honestly I
continue to use it because the spray is
just so satisfying it's the finest mist
ever it's truly one-of-a-kind I love it
so much I hope they come out with like a
regular setting spray because they do
have a mattifying one I hope they come
out with something that's in the middle
something that doesn't mattify you but
it doesn't make you Edward Cullen either
you know like I have a medium this
though this is so weird
you would think that this has the exact
same spray as the illuminating one but
it does not which I'm sure disappointed
so many people because I honestly I was
disappointed I was like yes finally
something without shimmer I didn't even
care that it was mattifying I was like
I'll take it I'll do it but the spray on
this is different it's not bad at all
it's a good spray but it's not as
excellent and beautiful as the
illuminating one I'm not gonna lie I've
only used this like once or twice didn't
love it it did kind of make my skin feel
a little tight but I have very dry skin
so obviously this wouldn't suit me this
was just sent to me by coverfx and I
wanted to test it out anyway it's not
terrible I think maybe if you have dry
skin but you do have an oily t-zone this
might be okay for you but if you're
extremely dry like me I don't love it I
don't think it's the best the Kat Von D
lock-it makeup setting mist is really
really good I told you guys in that
declare video that I was gonna test it
out a little bit more and honestly I've
only tested out twice since that video
you know having to evacuate at all but I
tried it out last night I did a full
face of makeup set my face and it lasted
all day I think this is a great long
wearing setting spray if you are only
using a setting spray to make your
makeup last all day I think this is a
really good one and I really recommend
it the spray on this is really good as
well but it is powerful and it is long I
don't I don't know how to explain it it
just sprays very far I don't know if you
can see it like it just like goes it
sprays long and very intensely like a
lot of products comes out of this so
when you go to set your face all I
recommend is that you really extend your
arm out do not use this one up close but
the mist is very fine it doesn't leave
like squirt water marks all over my face
I really like this one I'm gonna leave
the ones I don't like at all for the
very end Oh am I
I'm not talking about priming sprays in
this video either because I do feel like
those are different these are just
setting sprays unlike face mists or
maybe I should have spoken about primer
spray because it's just too much so much
this is the og of makeup setting sprays
I'm almost completely out of this one
this is the Scandinavia the makeup
finishing spray it's well free paraben
free it's excellent I love it I always
travel with this one because it really
does lock my makeup in very similar to
the Kat Von D one it just sets my makeup
so nicely and extends it all day I don't
know which one is more long wearing and
maybe I have to test that out but this
one makes my makeup last all day I love
it and I love this brown this too for
being one of like the first setting
sprays at least that's what I think the
mist is really fine I love it it's
amazing to continue on with skin and
navy I might as well touch base on these
this is the Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray and this is the Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
this one is long-lasting and this one is
cooling and hydrating I love both of
these they are both made by small urban
decay setting sprays are made by
Scandinavia which means I totally love
them I think the all-nighter one does
keep my makeup on all night I kind of
feel like skin like the original
Scandinavia one is a little bit more
long wearing that could be just me in my
mind but that's how I feel and I also
don't love the mist on this one as much
as I love it on this one they're very
similar but this one gets more of your
face I don't notice man this one kind of
like it's not as wide you know it's not
terrible I've definitely used worse and
the chill one is awesome if you have dry
skin because it does feel very cooling
and hydrating if you want it to be even
colder you can like leave this in your
fridge and just use it throughout the
day - like refresh and hydrate your skin
if you live like in Miami and it's super
hot I don't know but I do like this one
as well I don't use it as often as I use
the all-nighter believe it or not but I
do like how hydrating and cooling it is
and when my skin feels extra tight at
some times I reach for it okay so this
one I didn't know if I wanted to speak
about this one today because it's just
like a serum mist this is the pure serum
mist infused with hyaluronic acid and
onsen water I don't know what onsen
but this is from the brand skin Inc
they're a skincare brand and I love this
this is so hydrating and oh my gosh I
just I loved this spray it makes your
skin look dewy and glowing and beautiful
it looks great it's like a priming spray
and then it looks great as a setting
spray it just makes your skin look
awesome I also like to use this on days
where I'm not wearing any makeup it's
kind of like a spray serum it's amazing
the only thing is okay so the mist is
excellent on this but I think mine is
messed up but every time it doesn't
happen all the time and it's probably
not gonna happen now of course not it
sprays perfectly but okay it's not doing
it but sometimes when I use this it'll
like it'll click weird and then like
it'll squirt like little fat droplets of
water like on my face and it happens
right at the bottom so I think that's
more of like a like this battle's issue
and I'm not gonna buy a whole nother
bottle just because my little thing is a
little defective because this is
expensive it does come in a beautiful
glass bottle I love this packaging this
is more of like a luxury spray because
it has skincare benefits in it as well
so I do think it's worth the money
because of that I did not know I was
gonna love this as much as I do
this setting spray is beautiful there's
so many things I like about this okay
this is the glam glow glow setter makeup
setting spray first of all this smells
like bubblegum like delicious yummy
vanilla bubblegum I'm obsessed with the
way this smells it just makes me want to
set my face all day because the scent is
so delicious so major points for that
glam blue love that it also has a great
mist it does straight for a long time
like look at this like do you see that
the mist is so fine and it also does it
for a really long time like you don't
have to sit there and like it sets my
makeup beautifully and I do feel like it
does extend my makeup a bit I've only
used this once
since my declutter video I know but
these were the last two to test out
before I had to do this video but I feel
like it did extend my makeup not as much
as my skin to Navia one or my Kat Von D
one but I did notice a difference and
it's not drying it's not like mattifying
it gives your face like a nice glowing
complexion but it's not too dewy it's
just it's really good I like this one a
lot alright so I want to give a huge
shout out to this guy because I've never
mentioned it on my
ever but I use this all the time I'm
like halfway done with this this is the
honest beauty elevated hydration
replenishing mist I guess I haven't
spoken about this because I keep this in
my bathroom and I just forget to talk
about it since it's not like here in the
Beauty room but I really love this I
like it for many many many reasons that
are like this one this one is just very
calming to the skin whenever I feel like
oh my gosh I just I've used too much
makeup this week or if something really
irritates my skin for example off topic
completely but I have been trying out
the YSL all hours foundation yeah
I'm extremely sensitive to that I gave
me little bumps on my face and this
really helped comment down
this has chamomile in it which is a
natural like calming product it also has
calendula it helps calm and soothe it
has aloe vera which is also really
calming and soothing I love anything if
you slap aloe vera on something I'll buy
it seriously I'm obsessed to condition
the skin while hyaluronic acid attracts
moisture locking in hydration it has
great ingredients I mean honest Beauty
has really good ingredients this is free
of alcohol parabens phthalates
formaldehyde PE G's fragrances dyes it's
awesome it just has a very natural scent
but I love how soothing this is on the
skin so whenever I'm really irritated or
anything like that after I wash my face
I'll spray this on I'll go in with
skincare and all that stuff and I use it
like throughout the day to just soothe
and refresh the skin so I really love
this oh the spray sucks on this by the
way it's not like a fine mist it's a
little squirt II but since I don't
really use it with makeup I don't care
alright so if I had to just throw away
all of my setting sprays and only keep
five only keep four this would
definitely be in my top four this is the
morphe preppin set makeup setting spray
I'm almost completely done I have maybe
like two more sprays of this if I'm
gonna be completely honest with you I
don't think there's anything fancy about
the formula I mean I do like the formula
it'll use my skin very dewy and hydrated
but it's awesome strictly for the mist
and I will purchase it time and time
again for the mist alone this one was
sent to me but once I'm done with the
two bottles I have I will purchase it
I'm obsessed
it just the continuous mist is so
amazing and
you can just hold it down and it sets
your whole face it makes everything just
look so beautiful on the skin especially
if you have like a really chunky
highlighter on and you want it to blend
into the skin I really really love this
setting spray this is the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist this is my
second bottle and almost done with this
one I used to use this all the time as a
setting spray like when I first
discovered it I was in love I used it on
top of my makeup all the time but now I
don't use it that way anymore I strictly
use this as a priming spray but I did
want to mention it because sometimes
sometimes I'll throw it on top of my
makeup if my foundation looks really
matte if my makeup looks really thick
cakey and dry you know how you know that
feeling if you have dry skin when your
foundation looks really dry it looks
awful it doesn't even look like real
skin it's so gross all you need is a few
spritz of this and it transforms your
skin into oily skin it's amazing I love
this but I would only recommend this if
you have severely dry skin because it is
kind of oily it has kind of like a serum
consistency and it will leave your face
a little bit sticky if you apply too
much but I love it underneath my makeup
it's amazing it's pricey that suspensive
that's like super expensive I know but
the packaging is so pretty I know that
doesn't matter but so at least it's
beautiful right alright next up we have
these two-faced hangover 3 and one
replenishing primer and setting spray
talking about it because it's both it
claims to be both it has coconut water
probiotic based ingredients and Skinner
drivers it's silicone free alcohol-free
and oil free honestly I think this is
just like a liquefied version of their
hangover RX primer it's like it's so
similar it's very very hydrating the
other one is just a little more
moisturizing obviously because it's like
an actual moisturizer this one leaves
your face so duly so hydrated I love it
as a primer but as a setting spray I
don't think I love it that much I just
think it's kind of like oh okay cool a
dewy setting spray it doesn't make my
makeup lasts any longer but it's not
super like wow do we so it's kind of
like good it's just I don't know I don't
love it as a setting spray a little like
no it's just it's alright you know it's
not here or there so I don't I don't use
it like that at all but I keep it
because I do like
as a primer and the spray isn't terrible
I wish it was a little better but I mean
I've seen worse it's not that alright
and now I have a for setting sprays I
really did not like I have a few that
are like any to me so those I don't
really care to talk about but these I
just I don't like this one I thought I
liked but turns out I don't they'll be
having in to me sometimes this is from a
brand called pretty vulgar and this is
their luck it in permanent bitch face
setting spray the packaging is what sold
me on this product this is the reason I
bought it it's so pretty I mean this is
nothing but it's just it just looks like
a a perfume bottle I love it I freaking
hate this thing okay this leaks
everywhere I'm not sure if you can tell
but it's awful and I don't even like
store it on its side it's stay standing
up but it leaks like there's no tomorrow
total packaging fail I don't know if
it's just mine but it's such a mess and
makes me not even want to use it because
everything is just like so sticky and
weird the formula is also pretty sticky
and not like in a beautiful dewy way and
like oh I don't like this tacky feeling
way I don't know I don't love it I
thought I did but I used it with
foundations that I truly love like
diehard Willy Grail foundations and it
just looked weird I don't know it works
with some foundations but it doesn't
work with others and I just I'm gonna
get rid of this I don't like this I mean
you know I'm gonna get rid of it I
already declared it well if you saw my
declutter video but you know this Brown
this also sucks it like squirts out a
little thing I just don't like it this
is the milk makeup blur spray I love
milk makeup they have such cool unique
things but this blur spray no and I most
likely don't like it because it is a
mattifying setting spray this is the
invisible Matt makeup setting spray it's
supposed to give you like a soft focus
blur effect you're supposed to shake it
up really well I just I don't like this
it makes my skin feel really tight like
really weirdly tight I don't know if
it's just my skin type I don't know what
it is but I don't like it I also don't
love this spray it's nice but I feel
like the the droplets are kinda big and
it just it's not a fine mist that's the
thing it's a nice mess but it's not a
fine mist you know this is the Marc
Jacobs recover perfecting coconut
setting mist and I don't like this just
for I have a little bottle
I don't like this this leaves like giant
oily drops all over my face and it looks
like a super fine mist like it really
really does but I don't know what it is
about it that it just it looks weird and
it breaks up my makeup I don't know if
it's like the coconut if there's coconut
oil in this or something it starts to
make it like separate on the skin it
don't really like the setting spray I
don't like the spray or the actual
formula as a setting spray it just
doesn't work for me I would prefer the
tatcha one over this this one breaks up
my makeup while the tattoo and doesn't
it's so weird and I like it as like a
primer but since I don't like the spray
it's just not worth it for me in general
I also don't like the scent of this it's
like really strong I don't know and as
I'm spraying it on my face I like don't
like it I feel like I'm like suffocating
on this side mmm not a fan and then the
last one I don't like is the Tarte ready
set radiant skin mist it's not that I
hate this product it's it's just that it
does nothing for me the spray is like
short and quick and just like squirty
it's weird it's a little fine but I just
it's not my favorite and the formula
it's just kind of like what's your face
and then it doesn't really do anything I
just there's no room for this in my
collection I guess it's kind of like
boring you know doesn't do much so I'm
gonna pass that along okay I so that's
complete this video these were on my
high-end setting sprays and my thoughts
on the nozzle and spray the mist to me
