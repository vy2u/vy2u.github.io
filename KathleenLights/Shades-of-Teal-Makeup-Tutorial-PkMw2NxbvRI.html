tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I wanted to play around with the new
color pop colors for spring it's like a
really pretty mint ocean turquoise and
an insane blue and honestly this is very
similar to looks I've done in the past
with different colors I even did a look
very similar to this with color pops
weenie and Porter but I just love this
kind of I look it's like the halo eye
where you have like a lighter shade in
the middle it's one of my favorite
techniques to use I do looks like this
all the time I just switch up the colors
so yeah I wanted to play around with the
new color pop colors these are available
already and and okay so I tried the
braids I love this hairstyle I've loved
this since I was a little girl it
reminds me so much of Miss Hilda I've
said this before in a video I feel but
it reminds me of the little girl who
missed Trent bold throws over the fence
by her braids by her pigtails
even though hers weren't like this in
the movie she just had like a regular
braid anyway
Nicole Guerrero uploaded a tutorial on
how to do this so I tried my best and I
followed along her tutorial but I feel
like I just suck I cannot do hair I suck
so if you're frustrated because you
can't do here we're the same you and I
you and I
we're the same but anyway if you want to
see how to get this makeup tutorial
right here then just keep watching okay
so oddly enough I'm starting off with my
face I never do I always start off with
my eyes but we'll go with it
this is the skin a navy APRI Murs spray
and I'm just spraying that on my face
and I'm going in with a new foundation
this is the Josie Maran vibrancy argan
oil foundation this is in the shade
cosmic and I'm liking it I think it's
really nice but sometimes I feel like it
sits on top of the skin I need to play
with it a little bit more but it's nice
and dewy and I like it so far it's not
my favorite but I really like it so far
so for underneath my eyes I'm using the
Catrice waterproof camouflage concealer
I'm applying this underneath my eyes to
cover up them dark circles and I'm also
applying this to my eyelids to prime for
the eye shadows and I'm just going to be
blending that in with my Beauty Blender
to set all that creaminess down I'm
taking my RC Maino color powder and I'm
using this Sephora 47 brush to set my
under eye concealer I'm pretty much set
everywhere else
I applied concealer as well I also took
this wedding Wilde stippling brush and
just dusted some of that powder on the
rest of my face I'm going in with a
bronzer that I have been loving so much
ever since I tried it this is the Too
Faced sweetheart bronzer in the shade
sweet tea I love it because it has like
a shimmery side and a matte side and
when you combine them you get a
beautiful bronze glow I'm applying this
with my zueva 90 brush one of the best
bronzer brushes in my opinion love it so
now I'm going to go ahead and start on
my eyes I'm using the makeup geek shadow
in peaches and cream and I'm applying
this into my crease with the morphe e23
brush and then I'm going in with makeup
geek creme brulee and I'm also applying
this into the crease but a little bit
more precisely in the crease and i'm
using the morphe m4 4-1 brush to apply
that just going back and forth and now
i'm going in with this stunning amazing
color by color pop this is one of their
new super shock shadows for spring it's
in the shade luckily and i'm applying
this now with a Marc Jacobs brush but
honestly this is the kind of eyeshadow
that applies the best with your fingers
and you'll see here in a second but
first I am taking makeup geek bedrock
and I'm just used
I shadow to kind of blend out the edges
of that blue and now I'm going to take
on associate Beverly Hills I shadow in
the shade fawn with the same brush I'm
using an e 28 by morphe and I am just
blending this into the crease so that
you get a nice gradient from the blue to
like the warm Brown here's what I'm
talking about this eyeshadow looks
stunning once you start applying it with
your fingers I find that some color pop
shadows do look great with a synthetic
brush but this shade specifically apply
with your fingers I'm taking this luck
c22 9 brush and I'm dipping it into luck
fully and then buffing this into the
crease
this is just going to make everything
blend better I went back into fawn and
blended that some more but just go back
and forth with these two shades and make
sure there are no harsh lines excuse me
I went back into creme brulee by makeup
geek it just dusted that into my crease
and now I'm going to take this beautiful
color pop shadow in the shade flower
shop and with my finger I am just
applying this right to the center of my
eyelid I'm going to try to blend that
out a little bit with my finger as you
see here but I'm just going back and
forth with the navy blue shade and back
with my finger and just blending things
out you'll get the hang of it once you
try it yourself now I'm going in with
this stunning amazing Kat Von D eye
shadow it's called electric warrior and
I'm applying that right on top of flower
shop I want it just a little bit more
green in this look a little bit more
teal I'm taking white lies by make a
peak and applying that underneath my
brow bone to highlight and then I'm
going to take Mac nylon and apply it to
my inner corners and then go in with
makeup geek voltage right on top so to
line my waterline and my tie line I used
color pop swerve it's just a black shade
but I think I do like my next one the
best I'm going in with this tiny little
brush this is the zoeva 240 brush and
I'm applying makeup geeks peacock right
to my lower lash line that's why this
pencil brush is perfect for that because
it's so tiny and now I'm going to apply
some mascara and go in with these lashes
I bought these on Amazon I just searched
demi whispies and then
this came out and I decided to buy it
because it came in a pack and I loved
them amazing so anyway I'm going in with
the blush and this is Milani baked blush
in Luminoso a really pretty peachy blush
and now to highlight my face I'm
actually going to take an eye shadow
this is the Milani bella eyes eye shadow
in the shade below chiffon it's such a
pretty like white gold and for my lips I
went in with the anastacio liquid
lipstick in the shade it's really pretty
but it got a little bit crusty on the
inside of my mouth but I do love the
color so yeah that completes this makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed I
love how blues and teals pair with like
a peachy lip so yeah thank you guys so
