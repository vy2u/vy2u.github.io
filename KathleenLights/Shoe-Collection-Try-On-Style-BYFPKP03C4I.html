a fun video a quick hopefully hopefully
it's quick recently I have been getting
a lot of requests to incorporate more
fashion videos on my channel and I will
be doing that very soon um I want to
start including more look books and
fashion hauls and things like that and I
will be doing that in the near future I
can't do that right now and I'll tell
you why in a different video there are a
lot of changes happening right now in my
life that I will discuss in another
video but anyway I decided it would be a
fun video to do my entire shoe
collection these are all the shoes I own
and I was not going to do this video to
be honest with you because I got some
negative feedback in my sunglasses
collection someone had commented like
wow you have four ray-bans you must be
so rich when that person didn't know
that one of them actually cost me 50
bucks on Black Friday and I've collected
those four weigh bends in the past like
four years I don't want these collection
style videos to come off as soon Otte or
braggy because that's not who I am at
all
I'm from Hialeah so you know where Haley
is I'm just not that person recently I
have gone in really really into shoes I
never used to be like this at all
I was good with like a pair of sandals
one pair of heels and then a pair of
sneakers and I was good but it was
really highly highly requested to do
this video and when I did get some
negative feedback in my sunglasses
collection I tweeted to you guys saying
you know what forget it I'm not gonna do
a shoe collection video because I don't
want all the negativity that surrounds
it and pretty much all of you were like
who cares just do it anyway who cares
what people think so this video is for
you guys who wanted to see it anyway if
you are someone who's going to be really
offended by the amount of shoes I have I
know I have way too many pairs of shoes
more than anybody needs if you're
someone who will be offended by this
then please just don't watch don't just
to watch but for those of you who want
to see my shoe collection then I hope
you enjoyed this video and if you want
to see all the shoes I own then just
keep watching
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
