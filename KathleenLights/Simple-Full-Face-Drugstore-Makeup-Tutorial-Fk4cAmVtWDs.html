hey guys so let me address something
really quick
my dad decided to play his guitar right
when I went to sit down and film the
intro of this video let's try to look
past that
okay so the music didn't stop so um
hey guys this is gonna be a voiceover
intro I wanted to say a couple of things
so today's video is going to be a
drugstore makeup tutorial a full-face
drugstore makeup tutorial on this look
right here I wanted to do something
really really easy like for beginners
simple every single day type of thing so
this is what I came up with I am using
the wet n wild palette in no filter I
believe this is what it's called it's
from the Fergie line I'm mainly using
that bronzy pink color which by the way
is really similar to Mac's tan pigment
just saying oh and my brows I want to
touch base on them really quickly I use
my elf eyebrow kit so I did use
something from the drugstore as well
only I didn't film it because I take
forever to do my brows and I like this
but I think it makes my eyebrows just a
little bit darker than I'd like I really
like bold eyebrows and you guys know it
but I like it to come off a little bit
more warm and not as dark as this but I
use this from time to time and yeah I
just wanted to tell you guys that so
that you don't comment down below like
hey your eyebrows are scary I know guys
I know so yeah like I said this look is
super easy anybody can do it I mean it's
really really simple and so if you want
to see how to get this drugstore makeup
look then just keep watching so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to take my Milani brow eye highlighter
and I'm going to use the matte side and
I'm gonna apply this underneath my
eyebrows and just blend it out with my
fingers and then add this to the inner
part of my eye as well
next I'm taking my Maybelline Color
tattoo in the shade barely branded and
I'm going to use this to prime my eyes
and use it as a base for the eye shadow
I'm going to put down
I'm going to line my waterline and my
tight line with Maybelline's master
drama eyeliner in Midnight master as per
usual the eye shadow I'm going to be
using is from this wet and wild palette
and I'm using that pinky bronze color up
at the corner and I'm going to wet my
brush with fix+ before I dip it into the
eyeshadow just to intensify it a bit and
then I'm just going to pack this all
over my lid
to blend out the harsh lines I'm going
to take this matte Brown from this NYX
love in Paris palette because the brown
in the wet n wild palette is too dark
for the crease so I'm going to take that
on a Mac 217 and just blend out the
edges this look is pretty simple and
soft so I don't want to go too crazy
with anything in the crease next I'm
going to take this lighter shade in the
palette and I'm going to use this to
highlight underneath my brow bone this
color isn't very pigmented it's the only
one in the palette that doesn't have a
lot of pigment to it which is why I put
down that Milani base first next I'm
going to take my Jordana fabula nur in
black and I'm just going to add a little
wing not too thin or not too thick or
anything like that I got too close to
the mirror and then I got out of focus
because I wasn't paying attention if I
was in focus or not so yeah you don't
have to add a wing but I just wanted to
I'm going in with my L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black mascara and my Maybelline
the rocket vol right on the top I'm
going to move on to the rest of my face
and I'm using my hard candy sheer envy
primer to prime my face
the foundation I'm using is my Revlon
Colorstay foundation in 250 medium beige
I want to say I have it in the
description box but I think it's 250 I
kept smelling my foundation because I
just realized how good this foundation
smells and I never noticed it but yeah
that's why I'm smelling my too much but
I'm using this on my Real Techniques
sponge and it looks like I'm stamping my
face pretty hard but I'm not just the
fast-forward effect I guess
then I'm going to go in with my
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
15 fair and I'm going to use this to
cover up my dark circles and to
highlight underneath my eyes a little
bit
I'm going to blend that out with my ELF
pointed foundation brush
to set that I'm going to use my
Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35 creamy
natural and I'm just going to use this
to set my concealer underneath my eyes
to prevent it from creasing and I didn't
get a lot of sleep that night so well
the night before so my dark circles were
pretty bad even with concealer over them
but let's just ignore that I'm going to
take the dark brown in the wet and wild
palette and on the tiny little brush I'm
going to smudge this really really close
to my waterline
then with a pencil brush I'm going to go
back into that color we used in our
crease and I'm just going to blend out
the darker Brown just so that it looks
nice and blended and smoked out I'm
going to move on to the rest of my face
i'm using my Physicians Formula bronze
booster and I am just going to bronze up
my face a little bit like I said this is
a really simple day that they look so I
don't want to contour or anything like
that I'm using my ELF complexion brush I
believe that's what it's called I'm just
going to warm up my skin a little bit
take it on my neck and all of that jazz
and then I realized I didn't put mascara
on my bottom lashes so yeah anyway I'm
gonna move on to my blush I love this
blush this is from pixie and it's called
healthiest honey and it's just like a
warm peach it's really really pretty I
love it just like from day to day
because it gives some warmth to my
cheeks actually got this blush eye
marshals for like two dollars which I
know pixie is pretty expensive at Target
so I love this blush moving on to my
lips I am using my revlon matte balm in
the color elusive and I'm just going to
put a light layer of this all over my
lips and then I'm going to top it off
with a lip gloss and I am using the NYX
butter gloss in fortune cookie just to
lighten it up a little bit I thought it
was a little bit too pink so this is
just making it a more milkier version of
that color and that is it that is the
end of this really simple fast
day-to-day drugstore tutorial I really
hope you enjoyed this look thank you so
