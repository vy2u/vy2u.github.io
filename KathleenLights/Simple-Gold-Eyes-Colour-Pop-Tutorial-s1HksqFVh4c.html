a quick eye makeup tutorial using color
pop eyeshadows this is a top through
tutorial just because I'm only doing my
eye makeup in this video I'm only doing
my eye makeup in this video because I
specifically want to show you how the
color pop eyeshadows work on me or I
wanted to show you this eye look but
everything on the rest of my face will
be in the description box as per usual
but anyway if you want to see this nice
metallic gold eye then just keep
watching my eyebrows look super scary
right now because I have nothing else on
my face
don't be alarmed okay so the first thing
I want to do is I'm going to prime my
eyelids and I'm going to be using the
elf glitter primer to do that you don't
only have to use this primer for glitter
you can use it for just regular
eyeshadows too I find that it really
helps adhere your shadows to your
eyelids this doesn't leave like a tacky
feeling to your eyelids but I find that
with these eyeshadows I don't get any
skipping you know like if you were to
apply a powder eyeshadow on top of a
sticky base it would kind of like skip
and get stuck but these are so like
creamy that I find that they don't get
stuck so I'm going to start by applying
a color to my crease and for that I am
going to take this color right here
called
smash it it isn't a matte eyeshadow by
any means at all you can see but it
isn't glittery or sparkly so for the
crease it gives you a nice finish it
does have like a sheen to it but it's I
think it's so pretty for the crease I'm
going to take my morphe MV 25 brush this
is like the perfect brush to apply this
eyeshadow with
I just decided to go ahead and do this I
and then bring you in closer okay so
next I'm going to take this color right
here and it is called get lucky and it
is literally my favorite eyeshadow out
of all the color pop eyeshadows I own it
is incredible incredible incredible
definitely recommend using these with
your finger as I said in my review look
at that look at that Sheen
oh so good
now I'm just going to take this one
again which is the one I used in my
crease taking that brush and blending
out that gold a little bit and then
going back in to get lucky and layering
it again now because I don't have an
inner corner or brow bone highlight type
of color I'm going to just take my
Milani by the eye shadow in Bella
chiffon and I'm going to use that to
highlight underneath my route okay let's
get in the frame and it looks white in
the pan but it has a beautiful gold
Sheen to it
this also is what I use to highlight my
face I'm just in love with this and love
okay and really quickly I'm just going
to add a little wing I'm going to use my
NYC liquid eyeliner and my Jessie's Girl
liquid eyeliner and I'm just going to
add a little wing off-camera I also
added my Maybelline master drama
eyeliner in midnight master okay so we
are almost done
for my lower lashline I'm going to take
the color smash again and on this outer
V brush from makeup geek I am going to
run that underneath my lash line
then I'm going to take this really fun
color right here called I heart this I
need to be in the frame what is wrong
with me it is called I heart this and it
is absolutely gorgeous like out of this
world and I'm going to take it on a tiny
little brush like this this is from
Coastal Scents and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take my ELF makeup lock
and seal and I am just going to pour
some right onto the brush and then dip
it into the product and this isn't going
to mess up the product at all because
this is a cream product anyway so I'm
going to dip it right into the product
and run that underneath my lash line and
this is just going to intensify the
eyeshadow if you don't have this you
could use mac fix+ or eyedrops that all
works the same
you can get quite a bit of fallout with
this eye shadow that's why you usually
do my eyes before but since this wasn't
a full face tutorial I just did my face
makeup but when you do use this eye
shadow i recommend using doing it before
your face makeup but it's gorgeous back
into this makeup geek out of your brush
I'm just going to tip it right back into
smash and do that one more time
and this time I'm going to bring it a
little bit further down just to make it
nice and bronzed and smoky down there
now I'm just going to curl my lashes
apply some mascara I'm using Mac an
extreme dimension 3d black lash longest
nine meba

makeup tutorial really hope you guys
