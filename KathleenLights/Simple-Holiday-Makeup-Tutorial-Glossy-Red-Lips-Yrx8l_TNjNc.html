tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I wanted to do a Christmas look with
some green eyeliner which is what I did
but I didn't want it to be too
complicated so I went pretty soft on the
eye shadow it's not that many eyeshadows
and I went with a glossy bold red lip
which is very different for me because I
never wear glossy red lips it's always
matte but I really like how it looks I
think it's so fun for the holidays
especially for Christmas if you
celebrate Christmas if you don't you can
totally use this look for anything that
you want you could just change the
eyeliner and put a black eyeliner
instead I wanted to film a completely
different video today it was still a
holiday look but it was gonna be a
little bit more glamorous with very dewy
skin but my skin still hasn't gone back
to normal I told you guys already but I
recently tried a face mask that
completely irritated my face I woke up
with tiny little bumps all over my face
and you could still see them they've
gotten a lot better they were worse but
when I tried to film that makeup
tutorial it looked so bad because you
just saw my bumpy skin everywhere too
much dewy too much dewy so I decided to
go a little bit more matte for this look
I love it I know it's really simple but
I think it's a really nice holiday look
and I'm known for being simple I'm not
really known for these crazy dramatic
makeup tutorials and that's okay there
are a ton of people who do crazy
dramatic looks I promise once my skin
goes back to normal I will do more
tutorials better just horrible but I
really really like this and I think I'm
gonna wear this on Christmas Day I'm
having some family over and I think I'm
gonna go I think I'm gonna go with this
I look but I'll probably skip the
falsies anyway okay I don't know why my
voice is gone I woke up today and it's
like my voice is gone but I'm not sick I
don't know what's happened in there like
I don't know I don't know anyway if you
want to see how to get this makeup look
then just keep watching okay so I'm
starting out this look the same way I
always do I'm using my eye shadow
I'm a potion in enigma again ignore my
voice I don't know why it's going away
I'm going to take my visor palette this
is the neutral matte one and I'm using
that really light shade to kind of set
down my primer and I'm going to take
this warm shade in the palette and I'm
going to use this color in my crease I'm
just putting this color all I did
because I thought I was too far but
anyway I am putting this color all over
my crease really blending that in there
kind of a transition shade but I really
just I just want this everywhere and
then I'm gonna go in with my Becca
palette this is the ombre Rouge
eyeshadow palette I only want to use one
color in the palette which is that
really pretty orange you Brown but I
mean I'm sure you guys have warm toned
matte shadows in your collection just
use those
so I'm blending that in back and forth
I'm really focusing this kind of
directly in the crease not so much
everywhere and then I'm going to take
this matte shade from the Weiser palette
and I'm going to clean up the look a
little bit by applying some on my lid
and then I'm going to take the white
shade and use that to highlight
underneath my brow bone or on my brow
bone yeah so for eyeliner what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to draw an ugly line
first as usual and then from the top of
the flick you want to drag down and
that's how I create my winged liner and
then I build in the color on the inner
corners I'm using the Kat Von D ink
liner in the shaded Bukowski it's a
really pretty forest green color and
then I'm gonna take a makeup wipe and
kind of clean up the flick and then
perfect it again with the eyeliner and
then because I thought the eye shadow
looked a little bit too warm against the
green I took that more cool toned Brown
in the visor palette and then I am just
buffing this into my crease just to add
a little bit more of a neutral touch not
so warm on the eyes and I'm going to go
ahead and start my face makeup before we
finish up the eyes i'm using my Imani
perfect-10 primer and then I'm going to
go in with foundation this is the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation I love
these badboys and mix the shades 3.0 and
3.25 and I am applying this with my
Beauty Blender by the way I'm not a huge
fan of this green eyeliner I love the
color so much which is why I use it but
it kind of crumbles a little bit it's
kind of difficult to work with but I
love
the color so much anyway I'm taking the
tart shape tape concealer in the shade
light/medium and I'm applying this to my
face and then I'm going to go over it
with the shade fair because light/medium
is too dark but sometimes if I use fair
on its own it's a little bit too light I
really wish they would come out with
more shades they don't have enough
shades in the range but anyway I'm
applying this blending this out with my
Beauty Blender this is the best
concealer in the world I have know I've
used it a hundred times but I mean after
discovering it I don't want to use
anything else it's so it's so good it's
amazing
unlike this eyeliner that's a little
rough rough around the edges if you know
what I mean to set my under eye
concealer I'm going to use my NYC smooth
skin loose setting powder and I'm going
to set my under eyes with this using a
fluffy brush and I'm also going to set
everywhere else where I applied
concealer okay to finish up the eyes I'm
going to use another really bad eyeliner
actually if the counting one isn't bad
it's amazing it's the formula is a
little bit too rough for me this
eyeliner those eyeliners not very good
this is the Makeup Forever aqua eye
pencil and I never tug up my eyes but it
was just like not pigmented enough I had
never used this color before it was my
first time so it's not the best it's an
olive green color the color is amazing
but it was just a little bit hard to
work with it wasn't very pigmented I
took that vies art I shadow that I
pointed out and I'm using this to blend
out my lower lash line and then I'm
trying to go in with the eyeliner some
more to make it a little bit more
pigmented on my waterline and then I'm
going in with a more red tone eyeshadow
in the palette and blending that out as
well
I'm gonna highlight my inner corners
with a new exciting product this is the
LA girl strobe light strobing powder in
the shade 100 watt and I'm using that to
highlight my inner corners I'm popping
on some falsies this is by house of
lashes on Sephora they're in the style
timeless and then I popped on some
mascara on my lower lashes one of my
favorites mascara right now the trish
mcevoy a high volume mascara perfect for
your lower lash line super volumizing
and now I'm contouring my face I'm using
the Wet n Wild contour palette in dulce
de leche and I'm using the contour shade
to really hollow out my cheekbones and
then I want to warm up the skin a little
bit more and I'm using my Physicians
Formula bronze booster on a big fluffy
brush and I'm just using this shade to
really warm up the skin
for blush I'm going to take the H&amp;amp;M
blush in the shade brown sugar it goes
with any look it's the perfect nude
blush it's really really nice and I'm
just popping that on my cheeks and then
I'm going to attempt to highlight just a
little bit just that it'll be I'm gonna
use my essence pure nude highlighter
this is perfect if you have very
textured skin because it doesn't
emphasize it too much it's a very very
natural highlight so I'm just popping
that on my cheeks on my nose on the face
and then to finish up the look I'm going
in with my lip color this is a Mac Pro
Longwear lipliner in the shade he sheds
he should know he said she said I can
never say that why it's like I always
struggle to save this name anyway I love
this lip liner at last all freaking day
and it's a very very beautiful deep but
not too deep like the perfect holiday
red but I wanted it to be glossy so I
popped on the NYX intense butter gloss
in the shade apple crisp and this David
the Christmassy touch I was looking for
I loved it so that completes this video
