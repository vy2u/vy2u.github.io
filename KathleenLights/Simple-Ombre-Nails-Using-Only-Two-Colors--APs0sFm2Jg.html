a quick ombre nail tutorial and I'm also
going to be showing you a little trick I
learned on how to get a perfectly clean
manicure so the first thing you're going
to need is some acetone you're going to
need a little wooden stick to clean
around the edges you're going to need an
old nail polish brush or just any brush
to paint on the nail polish any color of
your choice this is just a pink one from
Sally Hansen it's called eye pink I can
and any white nail polish this is OPI
alpine snow you're also going to need a
base coat and top coat but the base coat
is obviously optional I just like using
your base coat and then you're going to
need a ziplock bag
so the first thing I do is I take my
acetone this is just one from like the
Target brand it's pretty cheap and it's
a huge bottle and I'm just pouring some
into the cap of the acetone now I use
this to kind of clean around the edges
of my nails the little trick I was
talking about but for now I'm just going
to set that aside you're going to want
to take your ziplock bag and just lay it
flat on your towel or on your desk or on
your table or wherever it is you're
doing this and all I have on my nails
right now is a base coat
I used the Revlon Colorstay base coat
it's my favorite base coat my nail
polish lasts forever when I use this so
you're going to start by painting your
thumb with the nail polish color you
chose and I'm starting the ombre from my
thumb all the way to my pinky so the
thumb is going to have the darkest shade
of pink and my pinky is going to have
the lightest shade of pink so I'm just
going to do one coat let it dry and then
do my second coat and the little trick I
was talking about is I take my thumb and
I dip it into the cap or have the
acetone in it and then clean around the
edges of your fingernails now when you
do this I do recommend painting your
thumbs last so you can use your left
thumb on your right hand and your right
thumb on your left hand but for the sake
of this tutorial
I painted my thumb first but yeah you
just paint your thumbs last that way you
can have a perfectly clean manicure on
each of your nails and then when you go
paint your thumb you can clean around
the edges with the little wooden stick
or a q-tip or anything like that so that
is a trick I learned and then you have
perfectly clean nails because you dipped
your little thumb and cleaned around the
edges
so for your second finger the index
finger you're going to want to take your
pink nail polish and blob a dot on the
ziplock bag and then take your white
nail polish and dip one dot as well
you're going to take your little old
nail polish brush and then mix the
colors together now I recommend doing
this in a room where you don't have your
fan on or the AC isn't like blasting on
you while you're doing this because a
the nail polish can get thick pretty
quickly so that's my suggestion so that
it doesn't go up and get nasty and also
you should work pretty quickly so that
it doesn't think thickened up or
anything like that
so here I'm just adding the topcoat I
mean the first coat and then I'm letting
it dry and then adding the second coat
and then I'm going to clean around the
edges with my thumb again
now if you don't want to dip your thumb
into acetone if you're not you know
that's not your style you can just dip
the wooden stick into the acetone and
then clean around your fingers
so this is what the second nail looks
like as you can see it's just about a
shade lighter than your thumb okay so
for your third nail you're just going to
blob about the same amount of pink as
you did the first time and when it comes
to the white nail polish this time
you're going to add two blobs of the
white like before you added one this
time you're going to add two and you're
going to do this each time your nail
changes so when you get to the fourth
nail you add about the same amount of
pink as you did the first time only
you're going to add three dots of white
instead of two and then with your pinky
you add four dots of white instead of
three now the reason you have to
constantly start over like start with a
new blob of pink and then add white nail
polish is because it doesn't get goopy
and tacky that way because if you were
to just continue to add white nail
polish to the blob you already had up
the ziplock bag it would probably get
really thick really quickly so this way
you get a more smoother application so
here I'm just painting my fourth nail
letting it dry and then adding a second
coat and cleaning it around just doing
the same thing on each of my nails just
adding an extra blob of white to the
paint
I'm sure you understand I don't know if
I'm explaining it pretty well but I'm
sure you understand
so after you've done painting your pinky
you should have something like this of
course you can use any different color
you want but right now all I'm going to
do is add my topcoat I use the Revlon
Colorstay topcoat this is probably the
best topcoat I've ever used because even
if you get like any mistakes on your
nails like there's a bubble or a bump
for some reason when you use this
topcoat it like smooths everything out
and makes everything look nice and even
I love this topcoat it kind of like
minimizes the mistakes on your nails and
it looks amazing and it also leaves your
nails like extremely extremely glossy I
just love it so this is the finished
manicure I just think it looks so nice
and it beats trying to find like five
different shades of pink nail polish to
achieve an ombre nail look it's just so
simple because you're using only two
nail polishes I hope you like this guy's
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
