full-face drugstore makeup look
absolutely everything that I use in this
tutorial is from the drugstore except
what I used to fill in my eyebrows but I
don't fill in my eyebrows on camera just
so that I make sure that everything in
this video is complete drugstore it is
using the what a mild vanity palette and
I know what this is this continuing on
people can get their hands on them I
don't think they'll sell them at stores
anymore but I got mine off Amazon and it
was like two dollars I mean you have to
pay for about I think shipping is 5
bucks but if you think about it that's
pretty cheap considering that these
shadows are so pigmented and so creamy
and so smooth that's all anything I love
so much talking about facts in my phone
I mean my camera is dying like a little
bit place I can't think anyway so yeah
everything I use two primers to
everything is drugstore so it's a really
affordable look and I absolutely love it
it's one of the looks I've been wearing
a lot lately
umm it's really flattering and it kinda
looks good on every skin tone every I
should I color everything so I hope
you've enjoyed this so yeah if you want
to see really affordable and beautiful
makeup look then keep watching okay so
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna prime my lids umm this NYX
eyeshadow base this is in skin tone I
really do love this but it can crease so
I like to use it with elfs eyelid primer
I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'm gonna
prime Animalia take some under
take that all the way up to my brow bone
blend that out and then with my ring
finger just kind of go into that
eyeshadow base
and just put that all over this house
like a yellow undertone to it it's very
yellowy I don't know if you can tell
okay and we're done driving our lids um
I'm going to be using the vanity palette
by one wild my precious vanity palette
I've been obsessing over this so
beautiful I can't even I can okay
I'm going to be taking just like a flat
shader brush like this and I'm going to
be using this like really shimmery
champagne tea color you can see that
yeah and I'm just going to find that all
over my lid you can have to continue to
dip your brush in with this color
because it is a little sheer I mean it's
pregnant it but to get that really like
shimmery look all over your dead you
have to dip your brush in a few times
okay then with a big fluffy brush like
this this is the Sigma e-40 it's like
this really big fluffy brush I'm taking
this color right here it's like the
peanut butter color I don't know if it's
just at this the exact color of peanut
butter I'm weird like that so I'm just
gonna I'm going to take that in and
slowly just work that into the crease
we're gonna blend this color in with
that shimmery color
sounded okay then I'm going to take a
pencil brush like this sounds a little
dirty let me write that down
I'm surprised like this and I'm going to
go into this matte highlighter cutter
and I'm just going to be putting this
into my tear duct area this is going to
go as our highlight
and then I'm going to take a fluffy
brush like this or any brush you want
and I'm going to put that as my
highlight under my brow bone as well
now taking a Mac 217 a dirty Mexican
scene I just use it on this side that's
why and I'm going to be taking that same
peanut butter color and I'm just going
to be working that a little bit more
into the crease I'm bringing it close
into my eyeball like I'm bringing it all
the way in and then I'm working it on
the outer portion of my lid
then I'm taking that same pencil brush
and I'm just going to take that
underneath my eye that peanut butter
color I know it's not called peanut
butter but that's the reference I make
to that color then I'm going to go back
into my a 217 brush and I'm taking the
darkest matte color right here it's
really dark deep brown and I'm going to
be working that on my outer V and a
little bit into the crease
it's kind of deep in the look a little
bit not going to take it super far in
like I did with the other sheet just
working it on the out portion and into
the crease a little bit
and take that same pencil brush and just
like we did with that peanut butter
shade I'm going to run this under my
lash line next I'm taking my favorite
eyeliner of all time
it is the Maybelline master drama and
I'm going to want line my waterline
now I'm just gonna line with the
Maybelline line stiletto I am an epic
fail on camera with this so I might just
cut this out but what you want to do is
not line it all the way in like this one
I stayed away from like that shimmery
color because I really want that
shimmery color to just kind of stand out
you don't want to bring the line too far
and you want to make it as snis possible
and wing it out I'm gonna see if I can
do this
successful yeah I could not do that on
camera had to get like extremely close
to UM to the mirror and then you
couldn't see me I mean I'll try better
next time to record it while I'm on
camera but yeah the little trick I use
well if you ever messed up and you make
the little line one with too thick I
always get a makeup remover wipe and
kind of just with the nail with my nail
kind of just make it straight and you
get like you know all this and you just
clean it up
but yeah so it makes it like a straight
line looks more cat-like so after I've
done that I'm just going to be taking
the same really dark shade from the
vanity palette and with my 217 I'm just
going to darken darken that outer V up a
little bit just going to Pat it and work
it into the crease a little bit just to
make the look a little bit more dramatic
and then I'm taking this shade right
here this one a wild um black and
Panther it's a matte black I was like
glitter in it but when you put on your
eyes it's completely Mac matte and I'm
using a fluffy brush like this and I'm
barely dipping it into the to the
eyeshadow and I'm just going to Pat it
on the outer V like swoop it lightly
so that's I'm just gonna PI man mascara
I'm using Jordana's best lash extreme
best last best lash extreme what is
wrong with me I haven't been curling my
lashes lately I'm like a issue with that
so I'm just going to go ahead and apply
it directly okay so that is the eye
makeup and now I'm gonna move on to my
face for my primer I used I recorded
like I was putting on my face and I
didn't realize I was recording so I used
the Monistat chipping ready powder Jo
and I'm out that's weird but I'm sure a
lot of you know that this works as a
really good primer so yeah that's what I
use as a primer and for my foundation
I'm using Revlon Colorstay this is 250
fresh beige and I use this when I am
tanning so it might be a little bit dark
but like my self tanner has worn off i'm
using the sigma f84 I love this for
foundation and yeah that's not that's
not that's not a good color but let's
try to blend this in as well as we can
it doesn't look too bad once you start
to blend it
okay that seems to look fine it's this
is one of my favorite foundations of all
time like high-end low-end this
Colorstay is amazing I need to get one
in a lighter shade because you know I'm
not tanning all the time so okay next
thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna
contour a little bit since I look a
little bit tanner with this foundation
already I don't want to look like Snooki
so I'm just gonna contour a little bit
and I'm going to use this because this
brush gives me like a very light kind of
contour and I'm using the elf contour
and blood contour blush and bronzing
powder and it looks like this I love
this thing so much and usually people
wouldn't think to contour with this
color because I had like showers in it
or it's like house like a sheen to it
but I love it
I'm just very lightly because this
powder is pigmented as you can tell it's
gonna lightly contour I don't want to
have you contour
around my temples tops of my forehead on
my chin do and then with the same brush
I'm just going to wipe it off my little
towel here I'm going to use this blush
and I'm going to lightly brush this back
after I can't constantly dip my brush
into it because this brush doesn't
really like put like on your face that
makes sense
okay look in there dirty and all you
know um for my highlight I'm using
actually one of the shades in this
Revlon Colorstay quad this is the quad
called adventurous and I'm using this
shade right here and lightly put this on
my cheeks and I like it because looks a
little bit scary now I kind of just
smooth it out so you can just give like
a flush of highlight I like it because
it is gold it's like a Goldy
and it goes on super pigmented so I just
push it out my fingers but it gives a
nice and now you can tell can tell nice
little Sheen to the face I love that as
a highlight it's awesome okay now all
that's left is my lips and I have been
absolutely loving this I am using the
covergirl LipPerfection jumbo gloss balm
this is in the color ballet twist I love
this this is like the most nicest subtle
pink I think I want to go back this is
the only one I have is you want to go
back and get like a bunch more so I'm
just going to put that all over my lips
this has a gold Sheen to it as well it's
like a light pink with a gold chain this
is why I added a gold highlight as
opposed to like a pinky or one so yeah
this is my
this is my full face drugstore makeup
look I love absolutely every one of
these products and I use them all the
time let me zoom in so you can see
better I absolutely love this covergirl
jumbo gloss balm it stays on for a
pretty long time and it's super glossy
you don't need to put a like a lip gloss
on top of it or anything like that like
some lipsticks I just absolutely love it
so yeah this is the finished look thank
you for watching and please don't forget
to subscribe I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
