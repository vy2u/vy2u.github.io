a make a tutorial on this look right
here it definitely is more on the glowy
side and it works really well for me
since my skin is so dry I don't know how
this specific routine would look on you
if you have oily skin but you can
customize this look to exactly the way
you want it this isn't like my go-to
summer makeup look I am wearing like a
full face of makeup I'm wearing like
foundation blush bronzer highlight like
I'm doing the whole thing the only thing
I went really natural on was on the eyes
it is a very warm like shimmery golden
eye look I didn't add a wing I didn't
add eyeliner I went really simple with
the eyes but my face is definitely full
face if you want to see my go-to summer
makeup look then let me know in the
comments down below because it's not
this it's a lot less makeup so this is
very summer appropriate because it's
nice and tan and bronze enos so yeah if
you want to see how to get this glowy
makeup then just keep watching okay so
the eyes are very very simple today so
I'm going to go ahead and do my face
first I am using my L'Oreal magic lumi
light infusing primer this is a very
very like luminous primer your going to
look nice and dewy I really really love
this so yeah I'm gonna try to cover up
this gigantic planet in between my
eyebrows and I'm using my yabby
concealer in the shade buff for that
then I'm going to move on to my
foundation I am using the bomb shelter
tinted moisturizer so it's on foundation
it's a tinted moisturizer and I'm using
my makeup geek brush to apply this this
oxidizes as I put it on my face so yeah
I love this tinted moisturizer it finish
it like dries to a nice powdery finish
and the coverage is pretty decent I
really really love it
then I'm going to move on to concealer
I'm using my booboo cover-up and I'm
just going to apply this to cover up my
dark circles I'm not going to go too
crazy like doing a whole the highlighted
look just covering up those dark circles
I'm going to set that with my Mac
emphasized powder and I am using my Real
Techniques contour brush to do so
I'm going to move on to the eyes now to
prime my eyes I am using my Urban Decay
a primer potion and I'm going to be
using my lorac Pro palette for this look
and I'm going to take this color right
here called taupe I believe and I'm just
going to add this to my crease and this
is just going to be my transition shade
I'm going to take this shade right here
it is called light bronze and I'm going
to apply this to my entire lid using a
regular fat not fat flat shader brush a
regular flat shader brush I believe this
is the Mac 239 then I'm going to take
this color right here called gold and
it's just your basic gold color I'm on a
Mac 217 I'm gonna apply this to the
outer view of my eye and then bring it
into my crease then I'm going to take a
fluffy blending brush with no product on
it and I'm just going to blend out the
harsh lines I'm going to take this dark
shade right here it is like a chocolaty
color called sable and I'm going to take
a pencil brush and just smudge this
really really close to my lashes on the
outer V of my eye just to give a little
bit more definition that's going to make
my eyelashes look just a little bit
fuller at the base it's really really
natural I'm going to take this cream
color right here and this is going to be
my highlight shade so I'm applying that
underneath my brow bone but for my inner
corner highlight I'm going to take this
color right here called nude it's just
like a shimmery nice nude and that's
going to be my inner corner highlight
then I'm just going to curl my eyelashes
I believe this is a Revlon eyelash
curler and then I'm going to apply my
mascara this is the Mac and extreme
dimension 3d black lash longest mascara
name ever but I am so obsessed with this
mascara it is definitely a new favorite
of mine and I'm just going to apply two
coats of this to my top and bottom
lashes
moving on to the rest of my face now
that the eyes are done I'm going to take
my josie maran argan illuminizer and my
Real Techniques sponge and I'm going to
be applying this to the tops of my
cheeks and then blending it out for
bronzer I'm using my Mac bronzer this is
in the shade refine golden I love this
bronzer in the summer because it does
have like little shimmers in it it's not
like chunks of glitter the glitter
doesn't show up on your face but does
give you like a sheen it gives you like
a beautiful glow I love love love this
bronzer so I'm just going to apply this
just to give myself a nice bronze below
I'm not going to like do a contour or
anything like that just to warm up my
skin a little bit then I'm going to take
my betty lou manizer by the balm and I'm
gonna apply this to like the back of my
cheeks just to give myself a little bit
more of a glow just like a very
highlighting bronzer it is a shimmery
but it's beautiful then I'm going to
take my Mac blush this is in the shade
margin and I'm gonna apply to my cheeks
like a savage apparently and then to
finish off the look I'm going to go with
the covergirl jumbo gloss bomb I believe
that's what they're called and this is
in the shade ballet twist and then I'm
going to top it off with this jus a lip
gloss and I don't remember the name I
believe it's like glace or something
like that yeah and I'm going to apply
this more to the center of my lip just
so I could look a little bit more full
and glossy right at the center so that
is the end of this look I hope you guys
