a makeup tutorial on this look right
here actually wore this yesterday and I
really really liked how it looked so I
decided to film a story on it it wasn't
like requested or anything I just wore
yesterday and I was like I like this I'm
going to film with tutorial so that is
what I'm doing today it's kind of more
cooler tone than I like I'm into like
orange e coppery golden e eyeshadows and
this is like purple and kind of topi and
even the lip is a little bit more cooler
toned so it's a little different for me
I think but I really like it and I hope
you do too and if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep watching
I'm gonna start by priming my lids with
Mac's painterly paint-pot are you
surprised I have so many veins on my
lids as you can see and I really like
this because not only does it prime for
eyeshadow but it covers up those veins
I'm going to take this foiled eyeshadow
by makeup geek in the shade mesmerized
and I'm going to apply that to my entire
lid using an elf flat shader brush this
brush is literally $1 from Target
and it really packs on color just really
well so anyway I'm going to take this
eyeshadow from makeup geek called
Barcelona Beach I'm using mostly makeup
geek eyeshadows today and honestly I was
supposed to do this part first but I
didn't so I just added my transition
shade after my lid color which I usually
don't do that but anyway I'm just going
to go back and apply more mesmerize
since most of it did get blended away
since I was adding that color to my
crease
I'm going to take this one it's called
white lies against Omega V and it's a
stark white eyeshadow but I kind of like
it because it's not too too pigmented to
where it looks like you're just putting
white underneath your problem raw bone
so it highlights nicely I'm going to
take my Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper and I'm going to add like a
little baby wing and it's gonna be like
a half baby wing I'm not gonna bring it
all the way in but you can do whatever
you want honestly that's just what I'm
doing so I've been telling you guys that
I've been really stressed out since I'm
in the process of moving right now so my
dark circles have been like really oh
that was a lot of product my dark
circles have been really bad so my
savior has been this first aid beauty
triple eye remedy so I'm just applying
that underneath my eyes I like to apply
it with the applicator but today I just
pressed it in with my fingers so I'm
going in with a matte foundation so I'm
going to apply a nice radiant primer
this is from Laura Mercier I don't know
how I feel about it yet I don't think
it's better than my angle for a primer
by Too Faced but I'm still testing out
so I'm going to use my Maybelline fit me
as you see Selene here's daddy screaming
anyway I'm using my Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless this is a very matte
foundation not super matte but I do have
to use a like radiant primer underneath
and then I find that it works really
well but I actually really like it like
it's matte but it's nice and I have to
work in sections I have to do half of my
face first and then do the other half
because this foundation dries so quickly
it is no joke like it dries instantly
but I feel like it's a natural matte
finish
my skin is really dry so if I don't
moisturize and I don't use kind of like
a highlighting primer underneath like I
did today than it does cling to dry
patches but I've actually really been
liking it and it's nice mixed with the
original fit me so after put on some
foundation I'm going to put on some
concealer this is the Maybelline master
concealed its new and it's amazing guys
it is thick but it goes on so smoothly
that it kind of thinned out I like to
apply it with my fingers because here
like it blends in nicely that way I
really really love it I'm gonna apply it
on my nose and my for in-between my
forehead and on my chin just to
highlight a little bit and I don't want
that like stark white under-eye
highlight today I usually like that but
I'm just gonna set my under eye
concealer using my Mac MSF natural in
the shade medium just so that it does
increase and what's not so to highlight
my face I'm gonna highlight first
because this is kind of like a creamy
consistency not really but it's a little
wet this is from dry lactic and it is
her pearl base it's a nice pinky color
like curly finish and it's so pretty it
gives such a nice glow to the cheeks I
like to apply it with like a dense brush
like this this is a real Techniques
expert face brush and I love the glow it
gives my skin
so I'm going to finish up my eyes and
I'm going to take this makeup rubber eye
shadow in the shade M nine to eight I
believe I will list it below and on this
little tiny brush I'm gonna apply this
really really close to my waterline
almost directly on my waterline and then
I'm going to take a pencil brush and
this foiled eyeshadow by makeup geek in
the shade Caitlin rose and I'm just
gonna blend that out I think it looks
really pretty like the purple with the
dark purple with the light purple has
like a nice iridescent and then I'm
going to highlight my inner corners with
that same girl lactic pro base so after
that I just applied falsies and mascara
to my lower lash line and that is it the
eyes are pretty much done it was only
two eyeshadows on the lid it was super
simple so now I'm going to contour and
this is a true match powder in the shade
c8 it's technically a face powder like
for darker skin tones but I really like
to use it as a contour because it does
blend so smoothly like it's a really
nice contouring powder because it's
meant for your face and it's just really
blendable I really like it so I'm using
that to contour I'm speeding this up
because it takes forever so after that
I'm gonna ply some blush this is from
Tarte it's their Amazonian clay blush in
the shade exposed it's a really natural
plummy everyday shade it kind of goes
with everything I recommend these
blushes so hardcore because they last
forever on the skin then I'm going to
take this lip liner from Charlotte
Tilbury called iconic nude I just got it
like I just bought it a few weeks ago
and it is so pretty it's a true nude it
doesn't have like peaches or pinkies or
probably's it's like a true like nude I
love it
so I'm applying that to my entire lips
filling it in a little bit and then I'm
gonna go over it with a lipstick this is
from Maybelline it's like their new
matte collection and this is matte
blissful it's like a pinky purple like
it's pink but it has a little bit of a
purple undertone I think it's beautiful
is probably one of my favorite ones from
the matte collection
and then usually I would just leave it
matte like this because I love matte
lips but I'm gonna top it off with
karkos lip gloss in oslo oslo oslo i
don't know just to give it a nice glossy
finish okay guys so that completes this
video I really hope you enjoyed it it's
a little bit different since it's a
little bit more cool tones but I hope
you guys liked it thank you guys so much
