little bit different I didn't think I
wanted to post this video but I've got
in so many questions and I've gotten so
many requests to update you guys on how
my skin is doing what I'm doing to heal
my skin like what's the update what's
been happening so that's what this video
is going to be about today very laid
back until I want to talk to you guys
about the products I've been using on my
skin but I was using what I am using
everything I've been doing for the past
three months to try to get my skin back
to what it used to be so I have always
been someone who had a really good skin
and didn't really suffer from acne or
major breakouts whenever I would break
out it would be in like tiny little
white bumps on my forehead or it was
just like a few large huge pimples
around that time of the month and then
after about like a week it would just
fade away with the bumps they would fade
as well after a few nights of really
good hydration and taking care of my
skin but recently around the first week
of August my skin totally freaked out
and I didn't know what it was I knew it
wasn't makeup because it started
happening on my chest as well and I
don't put makeup on my chest so it was
really weird it got really irritated I
just started getting bumps all over my
forehead and all over my chest there
were like little tiny red pimples but
they weren't like pimples I don't know
an exciting them I spoke about this
briefly in another video I will link it
down below but it actually started off
on my chest I started to notice red
bumps all over my chest and I hadn't
changed my body wash I wasn't using
anything that would irritate my chest I
never spray perfume on my chest always
on my neck so it was really weird and
then it started happening on my forehead
and it first started out like right here
on my forehead and as the days passed on
it started to spread all over my
forehead it got wider and wider and
wider on my forehead and it was the
strangest thing like I can't even
explain it it was like texture all over
my forehead and some of it was pimples
and some of it was just bumpy it was so
weird it's something that has never ever
happened to me before so the only thing
I could think of
that it was my diet because I had
recently changed my diet the beginning
of August I kind of cut out dairy
completely from my life I no longer eat
milk cheese eggs and I also cut out meat
I had recently gotten to a gastrula gist
because my stomachaches were getting to
the point where it was after every
single meal I had a stomachache and
that's been happening since I was a
little girl I thought it was normal to
have a stomachache after eating and then
when I went to a gastrula gist he was
like you know maybe you're allergic to
dairy and I was like whoa damn maybe so
I just started having a plant-based diet
to see if that would improve my health
and it did I stopped getting
stomachaches like I haven't had a
stomach ache caused by food in a really
long time but then this was happening to
my skin and I was like oh my gosh and
maybe is my body going through a detox
so for a while I thought it was that and
I just continued on with my regular
skincare since for months and months
prior to this my skincare was working
fine and then it just wasn't going away
and I figured that a detox wouldn't last
that long so I ended up going to a
dermatologist and I had never been to a
dermatologist before but I thought it
was the only thing left to do it got to
a point where my skin looked better
without foundation because whenever I
wore foundation they just looked like
tiny little fungus balls all over my
face really gross I know my mom so she
didn't really tell me much she just told
me it was acne she kind of looked at my
face and was like okay here's some
products now I will say that before I
show you any of the products I'm using I
am NOT a dermatologist I am NOT an
esthetician I don't know crap about skin
I didn't go to school for that please
take my advice with a grain of salt and
just because something worked out for me
doesn't mean it's gonna work out for you
and vice versa skin is such a tricky
touchy subject
so she prescribed two things for me and
I was really hesitant to try these
because they are very strong and I
didn't want to damage my skin any
further but I mean I was willing to try
anything she prescribed this epidote
Forte and it is an ad up Pauline I don't
know what that word means
and benzoyl peroxide gel and this is a
topical cream which they are very very
strong and then she also gave me this
these are topical little solution pad
and this is it doesn't have an exact
name it just says clindamycin Meissen
clindamycin clindamycin oh my gosh
clindamycin clindamycin phosphate
topical solution 1% and they just look
like this there are little pads you can
see that but they're just like little
pads and they smell like pure alcohol
like pure friggin alcohol she told me to
wash my face she also gave me like this
green tea cleanser that didn't really
work out for me I didn't like it at all
she told me to just wash my face before
bed and then apply the epidural forté
and then in the morning wash my face
again and then apply the little solution
pads this was supposed to just like
disinfect the acne or disinfect my
problem areas so I ended up really
really loving this I found that this
made an incredible difference this on
the other hand I have a love-hate
relationship with this so the first
night I used this I was floored when I
woke up in the morning my face looked 20
times worse than it did before I use it
it was so inflamed my skin went nuts
overnight and of course I went to
Twitter and I like flipped out and a lot
of you guys were telling me no keep
using it
topical creams usually make your skin
look worse before it makes it look
better so I ended up taking everyone's
advice because I got so many comments
that's that the same thing so I used it
one more night and I I'm so mad I don't
have a picture but my skin got better
like it dramatic it went from really
really bad to pretty decent like the
next day I was like oh my gosh it's gone
down so much the dermatologist also told
me to skip a day because I told her I
had really dry skin she was afraid this
was gonna dry on my skin too much so
when I went to use it again I noticed
zero changes like it had fixed it but it
wasn't really fixing it much and then
when I went to use it again it actually
kind of burned my skin a bit like once
it took everything to the surface and
kind of calm down my skin a bit it
wasn't working anymore I feel like this
was just burning my skin so I completely
stopped using it I feel like it helped
as much as it could and then I kind of
just went back to my same old routine my
skin was better but it wasn't going away
and after a few days of no improvement I
thought okay I'm just gonna do my
research myself I'm not gonna go too
I'm gonna figure this out on my own and
thankfully I had you guys to back me up
because I got so many tweets and
comments telling me that they thought I
had Malaysia for Leakey peace I know
that's how you say it but I'm not
exactly sure how you're supposed to say
it so it's like an inflammatory skin
condition that's triggered by like the
yeast in your skin or too much yeast and
when I started to Google images of
people who had this it looked really
similar to what I had Delta this day I'm
not exactly sure if that's what I had
but that's what it looked like so I
became my own doctor and I started to
treat my skin like if I had that again I
don't recommend that so a lot of the
treatments or how you get rid of Malizia
well good is pretty much orally like
antifungal medications something that
you definitely need to see your doctor
for but since I didn't know if I had
that and for some reason I don't know
why I didn't go to the doctor to ask if
I had that I used this on my skin and I
know this sounds crazy but it helped a
little bit this is nicer all it's an
anti dandruff shampoo and I pretty much
use this as a face mask that sounds
really bad but I used this as a face
mask only on my forehead I only put it
on my forehead and on my chest for a few
minutes I didn't want to leave it on too
long just a few minutes and then I would
rinse it off and wash my face and do my
normal skin care this really helped the
inflammation I truly believe that my
skin was reacting like that due to like
bacteria on the skin or fungus on the
skin I'm not exactly sure so I used this
a few times and I found it to be really
really helpful but I'm a chicken when it
comes to skin I didn't want to use it
too much so I kind of stopped using this
and I moved on to other things I started
to use a very very simple skincare
routine like very very simple and then
started to think like you know this has
to be something I'm eating there this
has to be something I'm doing and I
started kind of like an elimination diet
process I got extremely simple with what
I was eating I was eating like the most
bland most basic just like nothing foods
that I know never irritated me just to
see what it was and I kind of came to
the conclusion I think I know what
caused it I'm pretty sure that it was
kombucha I noticed that I was drinking a
lot of kombucha
and this was happening it's helped so
many people it's so good for you it kind
of has like good bacterias in it it also
has yeasts in it which could probably be
the reason it has a lot of beneficial
things to it and I wish that there would
be another explanation but there has to
be something in kombucha that my body
does not agree with but once I started
this whole elimination diet process and
I stopped drinking kombucha it took a
while but I noticed that my skin started
to get better now let's keep in mind
that at this point like as Kathleen is
doing this elimination thing and she
stopped drinking kombucha she didn't
think it was the kombucha I still
thought it was something else so I
started to invest in two different
skincare options and I am so convinced
that this has really helped my skin this
is the Sunday Riley UFO ultra clarifying
face oil it says this for oily to acne
prone skin which is the reason why I
didn't want to try it but I had seen so
many good reviews that I was like why
not let me try this so the first night I
use this I saw an incredible difference
in my skin it has 1.5% salicylic acid
treatment oil and my bumps just looked
less red whenever I use this now because
it is for oily skin I only use this
about twice a week there is a major
thing that I'm going to share with you
right now that I promise you it's what's
made my skin better but I'll get into
that in a second but yeah I noticed that
because my skin was so congested this
was just helping clear my skin to be
safe I started using a more natural skin
care so I started using the vanna cream
gentle facial cleanser I got this at
Target this is great for sensitive skin
free of dyes lanolin fragrance masking
fragrance parabens formaldehyde and
other preservatives sulfate free and it
is amazing it's so gentle I love it way
more than the Sara B facial cleanser and
more than the Cetaphil one those leave a
little bit of a film on my face when I'm
done washing my face this one didn't do
that it's really really great I
definitely recommend it for those of you
with sensitive skin and it's pretty
affordable I got it at Target like I
said I was using this strictly instead
of any of my other face washes and it
made a difference in how red my skin was
my skin was getting so red from just
drying it out and then for my
moisturizer at night
I noticed that my beloved my beautiful
origins night immense moisturizer wasn't
doing it for me anymore every time I
used it it was almost like my skin like
got worse the next day I don't know what
it is because I am a huge believer in
that cream it has made a huge difference
in my skin but for what I'm going
through currently I don't like it so
much I have always really loved the
ultra Repair Cream by first a beauty
it's safe for sensitive skin it's
allergy tested no artificial fragrance
and it helps hydrate parched skin
relieve minor irritation due to eczema
and other conditions and it's awesome
every time I have a really bad reaction
to something I always use this like for
years I love using this whenever my skin
needs a really good pick-me-up
so I have been using this at night time
before bed in conjunction with this this
my friends is a miracle product I have
come to the conclusion that the reason
why my skin is getting back to normal is
because of this this is aloe vera pure
natural disgustingly scented aloe vera I
don't like the scent of natural aloe
vera
it smells literally like armpits Danny's
dad actually has an aloe vera plant in
his backyard so I go and I steal some
aloe vera from him and it was actually
Danny stepmom who gave me the idea she
used to have really bad acne when she
was younger and she said that aloe vera
healed her skin so I started using it
and oh my gosh this is a miracle plant
I mean aloe vera is used for so many
different reasons they do call it like a
medical plant and I agree I love you so
what I would do is I would kind of like
rip open the aloe vera plant like this
and then I would get all the juices and
spread it Essam so disturbing I would
spread it all over my face and it's
really gross at first because the scent
is like but I would just rub it into my
skin like unto my full face I put it
everywhere and I would put it all over
my chest and it wasn't so bad because
aloe vera dries instantly like it feels
goopy and sticky and kind of like slime
it feels very very slimy but it dries
really really fast so you're not
sleeping with like this slimy what wet
thing the whole night it dries fast the
scent kind of lingers but I mean it's
totally worth it I recommend this for
everyone I don't
know if like aloe vera gel works the
same like the ones you use on sunburns
or like aloe vera face masks that they
sell in store I don't know how good that
is I would just recommend buying the
actual plant and using that on your face
it's the most natural way to do it and
in my opinion it's the most potent if
you don't have a plant of your own I
mean I see aloe vera everywhere I've
seen it at Publix I've seen it at a
bunch of grocery stores aloe vera has
become my new best friend I swear by
this it has made an incredible
difference in my skin I will say because
it dries instantly I don't think it's
really great for hydrating the skin it's
amazing for purifying the skin and for
like clearing the skin but it doesn't
really hydrate my extremely dry skin so
yeah I want to show you guys pictures of
what my skin looks like now I want to
say that I do have some scarring from
the situation that has been going down
for the past three months almost four
months that I've been on this journey to
good skin I've never really had really
bad acne in the past so I didn't know I
mean I always knew I always knew it's
bad to pop your pimples everybody tells
you that it is it's bad because I had
like two really large
disgusting pimples and from messing with
them and from popping them so much I
have scarring but it was so bad that I
am very very accepting of what's
happening right now it is almost
completely gone from my chest you can't
tell in the video but I have a few spots
where it's still bumpy I still feel the
bumps it's still red in some areas but
nothing like how it was before and
hopefully it continues to go in this
direction hopefully the Kombucha was the
culprit and now that it's gone out of my
system I won't be drinking anymore
hopefully things stay on this path but I
just wanted to update you guys on my
skin because I have been asked so much
try out aloe vera it is so good for the
skin let me know if you've tried this I
know we all have skin issues and we're
all struggling with our skincare so
let's turn the comments into advice for
one another
leave a comment down below with your
current skincare issue and maybe someone
else who has previously had that issue
but found a cure for it can comment and
we could just give each other advice on
our skin because it is
process oh I wanted to zoom in so this
is my forehead now it was so bad I can't
even tell you this is the scar this is
completely flat like you know there's no
bumpiness there but I have like these
three dots that I don't think are going
anywhere and I have the scarring from
the bumps over here as well but yeah
that's all I wanted to talk about today
that completes this video thank you guys
so much for watching it please subscribe
