my updated skincare routine this video
has been so highly requested and I'm
finally finally doing it if you can
probably already tell I'm doing this
skincare routine just like I did my last
one I have absolutely no makeup on my
face the only makeup products on my face
is the Loreal brow builder and then I
added one layer of mascara to my top
lashes and that's it just those two
products I have no concealer no
foundation and I'm doing that because
just like I did in my previous skincare
routine I want you guys to see my skin
my hair is crazy
I want you guys to see what I'm working
with I do really want to give a
disclaimer oh and I look at a makeup
product and I know that it's like
overpriced and just like too much money
and a lot of the times I'll pass on like
ridiculous like Dior Chanel and yso and
I usually skip on those brands when it
comes to makeup but personally I feel
like skincare is where I will throw my
money because you can spend all your
money on your makeup and if you don't
have a good skincare routine if your
skin isn't doing well then the makeup
you put on top doesn't look good either
if you have a crappy serum or a crappy
moisturizer and you're saving your money
for that really pretty highlight skip on
the highlight and buy yourself a really
good moisturizer or a good serum when
you have a skincare product that only
sits on your face for a few seconds like
for example a cleanser things like that
you don't have to splurge I mean don't
get me wrong they're really good
products at the drugstore and they're
really good cheaper alternatives I like
to really invest in my skincare that's
just the way that I see it but stuff
like cleansers and toners is something
that you can save your money on I
recommend investing in really good
serums and moisturizers because those
stay on your face overnight and they're
the ones that really penetrate the skin
and help the skin so you can kind of
save your money in other areas of
skincare these are just my personal
favourites everything in this video is
tried and true so I'm going to start
with my nighttime skincare routine in my
previous video where I talked about
skincare I talked about my favourite
face masks everything I went into full
detail but I won't talk about face masks
in this video I will do a whole separate
video on my favourite face masks
if you guys want me to I think when it
comes to skincare less is more in the
sense that you don't want to pile on
products it might irritate your skin
simple is best if you guys don't know I
think I talked about it in every video
that I have dry skin but I have dry
sensitive skin I have really sensitive
skin anything will irritate it so I'm
going to start with my night time
routine and usually have makeup on my
face so the first thing I do is I go in
with Bioderma I haven't found anything I
like better than Bioderma with removing
my face because it literally feels like
I'm putting water on my face um it was
tricky to get this in the States but now
they sell it on beauty lush calm which
is amazing it's for sensitive skin which
is perfect for me it cleanses removes
makeup and soothes and it's fragrance
free I love it because it doesn't
irritate my skin I could even put this
in my eyes and it doesn't sting my eyes
at all it takes off all my makeup
without me having to tug or pull on my
skin it literally removes every trace of
makeup I love it so much and I love that
it's a non rinse formula so it doesn't
feel sticky or weird on my face is
literally just feels like water if I
have super heavy makeup on like I'm
talking like heavy I will usually go in
with the Colleen Rothschild radiant
cleansing balm I use a lot of cleansing
balms a lot of them Antipodes I've used
a lot and I really love the Carol's
Carol's Daughter shows honor what the
Colleen Rothschild one also really loved
the L Genest one that I talked about in
a recent favorites video but that one I
like it on simple makeup days if I just
want my skin to feel extra hydrated and
I don't want to use that that one's
great because it's very hydrating but it
doesn't remove makeup as well as this
one so once I'm done taking the majority
of my makeup off I go in with a face
cleanser and I like to use one like this
because this is also a makeup remover I
make sure before I go to bed
that I don't have any makeup on my face
and I have found that any other face
wash doesn't really remove makeup the
way that this one does this is by the
brand philosophy and it is their purity
made simple one-step facial cleanser and
it doesn't dry out my skin
just so rare so rare I had been on the
hunt for years to find a cleanser that
doesn't dry out my skin this one any
other one I want to talk about they're
the best so I used that as you saw in
the clip with a cognac sponge
everybody loves the Clarisonic I ain't
about that life is long I'm scared of
the Clarisonic I know it's really
amazing but I just find that this guy is
so good and this is like seven dollars
um you can find cognac sponges
everywhere a doctor sponge has them for
really cheap they come in all different
styles this is the white one it's the
original they have like a black charcoal
one for people with oily skin they have
a hydrating one and all that stuff so I
just like the simple white one I love it
because it's a very very very very very
mild gentle exfoliator barely an
exfoliator but it gets right up in there
and it like deep cleans okay so I forgot
to show you this in the clip of me like
doing everything but I wanted to tell
you guys about this toner because if you
guys have been watching my channel for a
long time I have never found a toner
that doesn't irritate my skin ever I
even bought two pure witch hazel and it
was working for a while but then kind of
dried out my skin so I use the Kiehl's
cucumber I said that weird
cucumber herbal alcohol-free toner for
all skin types particularly dry or
sensitive skin which is what I am I is
dry and sensitive this doesn't dry out
my skin it's almost hydrating at the
same time a toner is just there to
balance out your pH levels from all the
cleansing and stripping you want you
know the pH and your skin to be back to
normal so that's basically what a toner
does and I just really like heels okay
so this is the product I almost did not
talk about because it's ridiculous it's
ridiculous I cannot believe I bought it
I cannot but this is a serum that has
changed my life I won't use any other
serum I just won't I won't
this is the drunk elephant TLC Fran
mousse glycolic glycolic night serum
refine and regenerate looks like this is
$95 okay before you guys kill me I
honestly
I was just so tired of serums because
none of them were doing anything for me
and I was at Sephora in Miami and I was
talking to the girl and she was telling
me she's like oh we're gonna get a brand
called drunk elephant soon and that
brand is amazing they're amazing and I'm
like oh really so she was just telling
me how this whole brand is so amazing
and like the founder and like the story
behind it so I went on safari calm and I
googled it and they already celled it
and they were already selling the brand
online and this had like five stars
people were raving about it like if it
was like gold put it on the back burner
for a really long time and then I was
just like you know what I'm gonna buy it
because all these people like it didn't
have not one negative review so I
purchased it and it's amazing it's a
refreshing hydrating gel that resurfaces
dull congested skin by gently lifting
dead cells away revealing an even toned
and radiant complexion fine lines
wrinkles and other signs of aging will
be greatly diminished
along with excess oiliness acne and the
appearance of pores so I really really
like this because it is a chemical
exfoliator aside from a serum I have
recently realized that physical
exfoliators like little beads kind of
damage your skin a little bit so a lot
of people recommend like HHA it which is
an exfoliator if you don't know so this
might be really confusing to a lot of
people but a lot of people say that
using like a serum with hae in it or
just like pure H a I have one from
Paula's Choice that's 10% HEA that's
amazing and I use it like once a week
I love Paula's choice but anyway this is
a bunch of ingredients in it that's good
for you but it also has 10% ha8 which
when you wake up in the morning the next
day your skin feels like baby smooth and
it kind of it's a gentle exfoliator and
it just leaves your skin radiant I apply
this to my entire face and it feels
really really cooling and the first time
you use it you notice kind of like a
tingling sensation on your entire face
it's like so strange but it feels really
nice I use this only three times a week
because the
ninety-five dollars and that is why I
use it only three times a week because I
cannot use this every day because I
would go through it so fast and
seriously I know it's ridiculous I can't
believe I said almost hundred bucks on
this but it's changed the texture of my
skin and that is the issue I have with
skincare or like with my skin I mean is
my texture I get bumps like it like a
road gross and this just completely
changed the texture of my skin I don't
like the packaging because this feels
like drugstore packaging and for what it
cost that just shows you they didn't put
much thought into the packaging because
all the goodness all the expense is in
this area okay so after I put on my
serum I go ahead and put on my
moisturizer you always want to put your
serum on first and then you put your
moisturizer on top because it's going to
like create the barrier so that the
serum and the moisturizer get soaked
into your skin nicely this was also in
my last game carotene it's my holy grail
nighttime moisturizer I will not use
anything else ever ever ever this is the
origins high potency night night Emmons
I find that this really helps the little
whiteheads all over my forehead that I
get it really hydrates my skin in the
morning my skin feels so hydrated and
not dry it's honestly the best and I
tend to avoid the eye area when I'm
putting this on my face so that I can go
in with my eye cream and a lot of the
time honestly I put on my eye cream
first I guess sometimes I forget I
either put on my face cream first or my
eye cream I don't know but this is the
product that blew me away out of all of
the products I was like when I use this
this is the Kiehl's midnight recovery
eye they have a midnight recover a
midnight recovery serum that a lot of
people love I haven't tried that but
this is the midnight recovery eye and it
put all the other eye creams I've ever
used to shame there were some that I
really liked but none that I really
loved and this one I more than love it's
the best thing to happen to my under
eyes and I know that that sounds really
dramatic but it completely took care of
the darkness I had actually I didn't
sleep at all last night so my under eyes
are pretty bad but this the darkness
under my eyes became so much lighter so
much brighter and even you guys noticed
in previous videos like wow have you
been using an eye cream because I can
tell your under eyes look better and
that's crazy coming from you guys like
that you guys noticed that it's crazy
what this did to my under eyes I put my
cousin jeanine onto this and she called
me like a week later she's like why I
wish I could have taken a before and
after picture because it has
dramatically changed my undereyes in
that short of a time and I was like you
welcome so that is everything I do at
nighttime my nighttime skincare routine
is a little bit more like in depth than
my morning literally I do two things in
the morning so when I wake up in the
morning this is the face wash I always
use this is the fresh soy face cleanser
fresh is a great brand and they're
usually very very natural this is
fragrance free and it's for all skin
types it's a very very gentle cleanser
but I don't know it's I love it just as
much as this but for different reasons
this takes off make up a little bit more
vigorously so this is why I use this one
a night but if you have super sensitive
skin and super dry skin this is amazing
I mean oily skin can use this too but it
has cucumber in it so it's very calming
to the skin it's just a nice gentle
cleanser and I love it in the morning I
use I buy the little one because it's
$15 the big ones like 50 I think so I
just keep my middle and then this is the
moisturizer I use on when I'm done
washing my face and then I am done this
is the Colleen Rothschild shear renewal
cream this stuff is great because it
sinks into your skin almost instantly I
would highly recommend this for oily
skin if you want to put on cream in the
morning but you but you're oily and you
just want to deal with something super
like this is amazing I use it too
because I'm gonna type of person that
even though my skin is dry I hate day
creams
targeted for dry skin because they're
like heavy on my face even though my
skin is dry I rather go in with
something like this that's light and
then apply like a really thick primer or
like a nice hydrating serum right before
my makeup no my dear mother I know
that's like really weird but it's what I
like to do so I highly recommend this
year renewal cream because it's so
lightweight it absorbs
gently but yet your face still feels
like you moisturized it it says a
promotes new cell turnover to help
minimize the appearance of fine lines
and wrinkles but I don't know if that's
true
so I mean I haven't used it for like
seven months or anything like that for
me w hotel but yeah so that completes my
skincare routine my morning and night
routine I hope you guys enjoyed this
