tutorial on this look right here this is
the look I was wearing in my morphe
palette swatches video that I posted on
Monday it's just a little bit more
intense I added a little bit more black
eyeshadow than I did that day and I
added a little bit of a gloss on top as
well but more or less it's pretty much
the exact same look I will link this
palette down below in case you are
interested I also have a 10% off code
with morphe in case you're interested
it's just kathleenlights it saves you
10% but yes I will link this below this
is my personal favorite look to do with
this palette because it's so smoky and I
love it
for going out at night clubbing a
romantic dinner
I love how super smoky eyes pair with a
really really nude lip but if you're not
into that super nude lip I know a lot of
people aren't just pop on whatever color
you want and I know I say it all the
time but this look is actually super
easy because there's no winged eyeliner
or any false lashes of course you can
add a wing you can add some false lashes
make it even more dramatic but I feel
like they look smoky and dramatic enough
to where it doesn't need eyeliner or
false lashes so if you're someone who
just doesn't mess with the falsies or
the eyeliner this look is definitely for
you and yeah I guess that's all I have
to say if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching okay
so I have already primed my eyelids and
now I'm going in with my Milani shadow
eyes in black ink by the way I'm getting
a cold so my voice is very crazy right
now but I'm just using this as a base
underneath my eyeshadows it's just like
a black chubby crayon I'm going to take
this light orange e peachy color in my
crease from the palette and this is
going to be the transition shade I'm
really going to pack this color into my
crease because I want the crease to be
very very warm and then I'm going to go
in with this bronze shade right here and
I'm just going to take a flat shading
brush and apply this to my entire lid
right on top of that black color
now I'm going to take that peachy color
again and I'm just building some more of
this color into the crease and then I'm
going to go back into the palette and
I'm going to use this gray cool tone
brown color and I'm going to use this to
kind of blend those two eyeshadows
together the bronze and the orange this
is going to be like a sandwich in shade
just using this to blend out the edges
making sure there are no harsh lines and
then I'm going to take this light matte
color in the palette and I'm going to
use this as my brow bone highlight I'm
gonna add another color on top of it but
just for now that's the brow bone
highlight excuse me so I'm going to take
the black in the palette and I'm just
packing this color on the outer corners
of my eyes and slightly dragging this
into the crease I want to make the look
nice and smoky so I'm just applying that
black little by little and then I
applied some more of that bronze color
on the inner part of my eye to intensify
the shade a bit I'm going back into that
cool tone gray brown color and I'm just
blending some of that into the crease
and going back in with the bronze shade
you know just layering so I'm going to
start with my face makeup before I
finish up the eyes and I'm taking my NYX
angel veil primer as my primer to smooth
the skin and then I went over it with
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation and I'm just applying that by
bouncing a damp sponge on my face so for
concealer I'm using the crease liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer I
love this concealer so so much it's
definitely one of my favorites at Ulta
and it's like three or four dollars I
love it so I'm just applying this
underneath my eyes to not only highlight
my face a little bit but to cover up my
dark circles this has really really
great coverage I'm in the shade light
beige and then to set that down I'm
using the NYC smooth skin loose
translucent setting powder and I'm just
setting everywhere I put some concealer
down okay so to finish up the eyes I'm
going to take that first shade in the
palette and just apply a little bit
underneath the brow bone and then I took
a little bit more of that peachy orange
shade and applied some in Mike
and then I applied the same peachy
orange shade underneath my lower lash
line and then I took my NYX lazuli gel
pencil liner in the shade pitch-black
and I use that to tightline and to apply
to my waterline as well and then I'm
going to take a smaller little pencil
brush and I'm going to take that grayish
brown color and I'm going to focus that
really really close to my waterline I'm
sorry that these parts of the video are
a little bit blurry I don't know why my
camera was not focusing on my eyeball it
was like focusing on my hair so strange
I'm sorry but I applied some of that to
my lower lash line and then at the very
outer corners I applied some of that
black eye shadow with the same brush I
took some more of that peachy color on a
fluffier pencil brush and just blended
all those eyeshadows together nice and
smooth and blended and then I just
curled my lashes and I applied my it
cosmetics super hero mascara and that's
it oh wait what's happening oh no wait I
have to highlight my inner corners ok so
I took the first shade in the palette
and I highlighted my inner corners with
that because it's so intense and still
brightening and I loved it but now we
are done with the eyes okay so for my
face I'm contouring my face using the
Kevin Kwan sculpting powder in the shade
light and I'm just contouring my face
with this this look is kind of you know
dramatic and smoky so I want to make
sure I'm carving out my cheekbones and
I'm contouring but I also wanted a
little bit of warmth to the face I
wanted to bronze up the skin a little
bit so I use the hourglass ambient
lighting bronzer in the shade luminous
bronze light and I'm just putting that
everywhere then I'm going to not not
necessarily bake but I'm just going to
clean up my contour a little bit using
that same NYC powder I just applied a
little bit of powder there or a lot of
bit of powder and left it on for like a
second and then dusted it away and
cleaned up my contour a bit so for blush
I'm taking this urban decay after go
after girl after go in the shade and
decent it's a very peachy orange shade I
love it and for highlight I'm taking one
of the news you a highlight this is in
the shade of citrine it's definitely my
favorite one out of all
them and I'm just highlighting my face
with this color with this highlight
whatever you want to call it and then to
finish off the look I'm applying a
liquid lipstick this is a very very nude
liquid lipstick this is from dose of
colors and it's in the shade sand it's
very very light but I really like it and
then I applied some lipgloss on top this
is the Catrice infinite shine lip gloss
in the shade like a nude life and yeah
that completes this look I really hope
