tutorial I'm on like makeup to tour I'm
on a makeup tutorial role it is on this
look right here I haven't used makeup
geek products in a while so I decided to
just bust out my makeup geek eyeshadows
so that yeah make a week I can't find
the words today all the eyeshadows on my
eyes are makeup geek is what I was
trying to say it's like an icy green
with a really intense lower lash line I
know a lot of people don't really like
lower lash like a super intense lower
lash line but I think it's so like
captivating I love super smoky lower
lash line so that's why I kept the top
really simple no liner like just like
two eyeshadows pretty much and then I
focused the drama on the bottom so yes
my hair is a mess and so is the lighting
the lighting in this video was like
really off I feel because I'm filming
really late at night which I usually
film during the day so I don't have any
sunlight at all in my room right now so
I'm sorry that the lighting kind of
sucks anyway if you wanted to have to
get this look then just keep watching so
for a primer I am using the Mac
painterly paint-pot
I use this all the time it masks the
veins on my eyelids and I really like
that this eyeshadow is from makeup geek
all the eyeshadows are from makeup geek
this one is called baby face and I'm
just using this to set the excuse my
singing I'm just using that to set down
the Paint Pot now I'm taking high tea I
love this eyeshadow I highly recommend
it it's a nice like olive green but it's
really pigmented it's really amazing I
don't know I really really love it so
I'm taking one of her boiled eyeshadows
and look at that look at that fullness
it's amazing by the way I'm recording
this voice over really really really
really late in the middle of the night
so my voice is like cracking anyway this
foil eyeshadow is called charmed and I
started putting it on with an eye shadow
I mean with a brush and then I just
finished putting it on with my finger
I'm going right back into high tea just
to blend everything out and then I'm
going to take ice queen and this is
going to be my brow bone highlight I
like it because it's not a flat white
color it has like a sheen to it okay so
this is a brand new product I just got
it's the Marc Jacobs it looks like a
pill that's why I was a doing that and
see Marc Jacobs undercover coconut
primer I got it just because it said it
had coconut in it and I feel like I put
on a little bit too much this is the
first time I used it and it smells
faintly of coconuts not too much but it
is really hydrating it basically feels
like a super intense moisturizer I don't
know if it's as good as the two-faced
one just yet and Here I am looking for a
brush to put on my foundation but yeah
let's move on I'm gonna mix these two
foundations this is the Too Faced Born
This Way and the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
tramonto me yes The True Match Lumi okay
it's really late guys I love mixing the
two because the Too Faced one just gives
you a flawless finish but adding the
L'Oreal one makes it a little bit dewier
so I noticed that I didn't really match
my neck much I'm not as tan as I usually
am so it didn't match my neck so I'm
like trying to drag it down and I'm like
hmm yeah the colour it's a little off so
I'm just gonna add a lot more concealer
than usual to try to blend everything
out I'm using the Maybelline and better
skin concealer I can't stop using this I
wasn't a big fan of it at first and now
it's like one of my favorites I cannot
stop using it so I'm just applying this
all over my face like I usually do just
adding probably a little bit more than
use and with my Sedona lace 217 I am
blending all that out
I'm going to set all of the concealer
with the Maybelline fit me powder in
1/35 creamy natural this is a real
techniques contour brush by the way and
I'm just using that to set everything
okay so I'm going to finish off my eyes
and this part makes me cringe because
you guys know I hate tugging at my eyes
and I never really do but for some
reason I did tonight this is the Milani
shadow eyes chubby stick eyeliner thing
in black and then I'm just smudging that
out with like a little Ecotools brush
I'm going to work on smoking out that
lower lash line this is dirty martini
it's such a nice deep green I'm applying
that right on top of the eyeliner and I
put the black base so that it can look
like a super super dark green so yes I'm
just blending that out with a morphe
pencil brush then I'm going to go into
high tea this beautiful like grey olive
color and putting that right on top and
then I'm just blending everything out
for my inner corner highlight I'm using
shimma shimma on a pencil brush and then
I want my lower lashes to be like very
volumizing so I'm using the Clinique
bottom lash mascara because I feel like
it gives my lower lashes a lot of volume
and then for my top lashes I just threw
on some L'Oreal telescopic and that
completes my eye look a lot of people
complain that I don't wear falsies
enough but I just don't wear them all
the time it's not very practical for me
I don't know I just don't wear it a lot
wear them a lot but anyway I'm just
warming up my skin before I go ahead and
contour using the NYC Sun and bronze in
Montauk bronze and then I'm going to
contour my face this is the Kevyn Aucoin
sculpting powder in medium and I'm
contouring with a morphe M five-10 brush
I love this brush to contour with
because it doesn't give you like a super
harsh you know NARS EDA brush kind of
contour it's a little bit fluffier for
blush I am using makeup geek spellbound
and I'm using the same brush I used to
bronze my face with and that is the Real
Techniques multitask brush for the
highlights i am using the betty know the
mary lou manizer by the balm this is the
morphe M 501 brush if you were wondering
so yes I'm just highlighting you know
like I usually do and then to finish off
this look I'm adding my lipstick I
wanted something very very very pale
nude but you can do whatever you want
this is Cairo it is a NYX soft matte lip
cream and I am just applying that to my
lips as you can see it's very very light
super pale you can put like a lip gloss
on top or use an eyeliner an eyeliner a
lip liner under instead anyway that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
