tutorial on this look right here it is a
daytime glam kind of look but really
nice for the springtime this isn't by
any means like a minimal springtime
makeup kind of look like it's not very
fresh face and minimal makeup this is
like the whole nine yards like I have
makeup on it's a little bit more subdued
than what you would do if you were going
out at night this video is a special one
because it is a collaboration with my
friend here on YouTube desi Perkins
which I know you guys are all subscribed
to her because she's amazing and
beautiful we've been going back and
forth for months we've been wanting to
collab for months but we just never got
around to doing it and we didn't know
what to do
so we decided to do spring looks I would
do the daytime and she would do the
nighttime so I'm gonna link her video
down below I'm gonna link her channel as
well her look is also a springy kind of
look but obviously I'm more suited for
the nighttime like going out on the town
kind of look I actually got the chance
to meet her when I went to I met LA and
she's just as pretty and on the inside
as she is on the outside cuz I mean we
all know she's beautiful but she also
has a really kind and really nice
personality I love her so much so make
sure you go subscribe to her because you
won't be disappointed she's a lot cooler
than I am her videos are a lot better
than mine go subscribe but anyway sorry
if you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching ok so I've
already done my eyebrows because they
take a million years to do so I usually
most of the time to the off-camera I've
decided to do a face first which is
really rare for me I usually always do
my eye makeup first but it's not going
to be like a crazy black smokey eye or
anything so I'm gonna go and start with
the base
I'm using my bare minerals primetime BB
primer cream in light this is really
good because it has SPF 30 in it which
is nice in the springtime if you're
going to be out during the day or
anything like that so I actually really
really like this primer and I find that
the tint kind of does even out your skin
tone just a little bit because I don't
want my makeup to look really heavy I'm
going to use the Make Up For Ever face
and body foundation I have mine in 30 -
this is a very light coverage foundation
but it makes your skin look really nice
it lasts all day and I just really like
how it wears and how it looks for
concealer I'm using the Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade 15 fair
I like this concealer I like on a
day-to-day basis because it covers well
but it doesn't feel heavy like the NARS
radiant creamy concealer is a little bit
more thick and full coverage I don't
know why I'm comparing the tooth but I
really like how this one feels on a more
daily basis
I look a little crazy right now but it
all ties together I'm going to take a
powder again from the Maybelline fit me
line and really like this line this is
135 creamy natural I like this because
it kind of has a good iridescent to it
it reminds me a lot of Mac's emphasize
powder and I'm going to use that to set
my concealer I'm also going to set the
concealer on my eyes I'm using that
concealer kind of like a primer today
but you can use like a real primer so
for my eyes I'm going to keep it very
neutral as you can see there's no liner
or anything but it just has a little bit
of glam with the sparkly lid I'm going
to use my it cosmetics naturally pretty
palette because they have really pretty
warm shades in this and the first color
I'm going into is this one called
transforming pearl it's just like a
shimmery champagne shade and this is
going to go underneath my brow bone and
on the inner corners of my eyes next
with a fluffy blending brush I'm going
to take the color called warmth it's a
really pretty light light brown with a
little bit of a pink undertone it's a
warm Brown and I'm going to take this
right into my crease
then on a smaller blending brush this is
the Dell iam tool 776 I'm going to take
this one called sunrise it's a really
pretty light neutral Orange it's not too
bright or in-your-face
so I'm going to take this on the outer
portion of my eye and into my crease as
well
on a small pencil brush I'm going to
take that same sunrise color and I'm
going to drag it all the way across my
lower lash line for that really pretty
sparkle on the lid I'm going to take
this color pop eyeshadow in the shade
lovely it's a really pretty like
champagne e gold glittery goodness I
don't know how to describe it but you
obviously can see it and I'm just going
to apply this on my lid but I'm not
taking it on the outer corners I'm just
focusing this on the inner part and
right in the center
I'm not going to add falsies of course
because this is more like a daytime look
I mean you can if that's what you're
comfortable with but I'm just going to
apply some mascara I'm going to take the
colossal volume Express on my top lashes
and then I'm going to take the
Maybelline lash discovery on my bottom
lashes but before I do that I'm going to
curl my lashes this is the shoe Laura
eyelash curler
okay so to finish off my face I'm going
to keep it fairly simple I'm going to
take this bareMinerals bronzer in the
beach is waiting it's a really pretty
bronzer with kind of like a sheen to it
it's a nice like glowy sheen so this is
what I'm using on my entire face because
I don't blend to contour or anything
since I want this look to be nice and
warm but nothing harsh like a contour my
brush smells really good well don't know
why
you
I'm gonna add a little bit of blush just
like a tiny bit time it I'm going to use
the Clinique nude pop blush this is a
really pretty like everyday natural
peach color and I'm only bringing it
right there and right there normally I
would just leave it like this because
the bronzer is kind of glowy in itself
but I am going to add just a little bit
of highlights I'm going to use the
hourglass luminous light ambient powder
because it's the most natural highlight
I have it's perfect for every single day
and it just gives like a touch to your
face
so I'm only adding very little you could
completely skip this step cuz a nice
luminous bronzer is really pretty just
by itself and then I'm going to finish
off the look with a nice bold lipstick
this is um a bright coral from Wet n
Wild this is in the shade what's up doc
which if you saw my recent cat's video
you know why this is funny to me it's so
intense like it's even more neon in
person I recommend lining your lips
first but surprisingly enough I do not
have like a nice coral lip liner with
all the lip liners I have
I love these wet and wild megalast
lipsticks because they literally last
all day this lipstick kind of stains my
lips to be honest like it's on my mouth
for a long time and it's not matte or
glossy it's like the perfect formula
okay guys so that completes this makeup
look honestly my favorite part of this
look is the lip I surround it I
surrounded my entire look based on this
coral lipstick that I highly recommend
the beautiful
I think it's glamorous but daytime
glamorous for me at least so thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
but I'm Anna I'm good even I'm gonna use
my Maybelline fit me concealer in the
shade darn it
I'd like this I like this for that
really pretty pop of sparkle I'm going
to take this color pop eyeshadow in the
shade lever lovely lor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
