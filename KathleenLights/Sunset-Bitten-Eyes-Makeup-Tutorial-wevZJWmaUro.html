oh hey guys so today's video is another
makeup tutorial this one is a little bit
more dramatic than the last one I posted
when I did my entire makeup geek
collection video where I showed you guys
all my makeup geek products I got
requested to do a video using the shade
bitten though that is what I'm doing
today I also know that you guys
requested the look I was wearing in that
video and I was actually just playing
around with the makeup and I created
that look so I'm gonna try to recreate
it cuz I remember what I used but I'm
still going to try to recreate it for
you guys don't you worry hopefully so
yeah this is one of my favorite looks to
where it's very me very warm
reddish-brown colors it's one of my
favorite looks to do I do have a look
coming up using the mega Pro palette
that is more cool toned well Oh almost
dropped this that is more cool tone so
stay tuned for that but this makeup
would look absolutely beautiful if you
have green hazel you know those kind of
eyes because the red tones really make
green eyes pop now I just recently did a
look similar to this using my amrezy
palette from Anastasia but it was
limited edition not everybody has that
palette so I figured since it was
requested for me to do a look using
bitten that I would do this because it's
like my favorite with the oranges and
all that stuff have I been talking too
much already
so if you want to see how to get this
look then just keep watching okay so the
first thing I'm gonna do is pry my
eyelids and recently I have gotten into
prime my eyelids with concealer I don't
know why this is the LA girls Pro
concealer in creamy beige three beige
yes this is a zoeva brush I'm using to
blend that all out
so the first eyeshadow I'm taking is
Peach Smoothie by make it eek I am using
all makeup geek eyeshadows in this video
and I'm just buffing this into my crease
with a sigma e40 brush just a fluffy
blending brush I cannot
that word and that's going to be my
transition shade then I'm going to take
cocoa bear and I'm going to blend this
into my crease as well but this one is
going to be a little bit more precise
I put Peach Smoothie pretty much
everywhere this one is going to be
directly in the crease kind of a little
more precise basically
next thing I'm doing is I'm going to
take this eyeshadow right here it is
called burlesque it's a nice cranberry
shade and on a flat shader brush I am
just going to pack this on my entire lid
you can skip this step if you just want
to use bit in by itself but for some
reason I decided to layer them so the
first thing I'm doing is just applying
burlesque on the entire eye and then I'm
going to take bitten I'm going to take
the bitten eyeshadow and I'm going to do
the exact same thing bitten is a little
bit more pigmented and it has a little
bit more red while burlesque is a little
bit more purple cranberry this one leans
more towards red and it's matte
burlesque isn't matte but I don't know I
just kind of like the combination of
both of them so I'm going to pack this
off my entire lid then i'm gonna take
cocoa bear again I'm going to take my
Mac 217 and I'm just going to start
blending this into the crease I kind of
want the colors to blend together cocoa
bear and biddin so after this point
basically it's just a lot of going back
and forth and blending and just making
sure that they kind of blend together
does that make sense I hope so
so I'm basically just buffing that Coco
bear eyeshadow into the crease and then
after that I'm going to go back into
bidding and I'm going to apply it to the
lid because a lot of it did get blending
away a lot of it did get blended away
with all the blending we did okay
how many times am I going to say blend
in this video I don't know
so yeah just packing that on once again
and then I'm going to take a fluffy
brush with no additional product and I'm
going to blend out the edges of those
colors then I'm going to dunk my
eyeshadow brush roll the same brush I
just use into this shadow right here
it's called chickadee it's a very orange
yellow kind of color I love it and what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
dust this in my crease kind of where the
cocoa bear shadow ends I'm just going to
go back and forth and I'm going to dust
it this is just going to give the
eyeshadow look more warmth and a hint of
orange I'm going to go back into cocoa
bear and then put some more in my crease
and that's just what I did right there
I'm going to take these two eyeshadows
this is white lies and vanilla bean
Emily and I'm going to blend them
together we'll use them both together as
my brow bone highlight and then I'm
going to go into shimma shimma and I'm
going to put this directly under the
arch well I guess everywhere but I'm
also going to put this on top just to
give it more shine like a shimmery look
I'm taking a makeup wipe and I'm just
cleaning up the eyeshadow just in case
there was any fallout or anything like
that I'm going to take my Maybelline
master drama eyeliner in Midnight Master
and I'm going to tightline with this and
then I'm going to also apply this to my
waterline as well I think this look
looks really nice with black eyeliner
this is my Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper and I'm just going to add a wing
I could never do this on camera but it's
going to be like a medium sized wing not
too too thin but not too thick either
and then here I'm just curling my lashes
I'm going to skip falsies today and I'm
going to take my Jordana best lash
extreme and just pack that on I'm going
to move on to the rest of my face really
quickly before finishing my eyes I'm
taking my primer this is the Too Faced
hangover RX primer I love it it's my
favorite and then I'm going to take my
makeup forever HD primer this nope
foundation this is in the shade
da-da-da-da-dah one oh god what is this
called hold on let me open my foundation
drawer
I'll tell you right now okay that is in
the shade 140 yes 140 I'm going to take
my Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20
and I'm going to apply this to my dark
circles this is really full coverage and
I love it it covers up the dark circles
pretty nicely then I'm going to take
this product right here this is the
Maybelline nude Maybelline oh my gosh
I'm terrible all that I have it in my
drawer as well okay this is the
Maybelline Dream Lumi touch highlighting
concealer this is in the shade ivory and
I'm just applying this underneath my
eyes and to the center of my face just
the parts that I want to be highlighted
just to highlight my face a little bit
more and I'm blending that in with a
real techniques contour brush my Holy
Grail concealer brush it is life I love
it more than anything for concealer it's
amazing
I'm going to set all that using my
Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35 creamy
natural uses all the time it sets my
under-eye concealer
really nicely because it's a funny
milled powder I like it so I'm using my
ELF tapered highlighter brush to set
that it's perfect for setting concealer
under the eyes it's amazing
okay so after I've set my concealer I'm
going to move on to my eyes just to
finish them up I'm going to take bit in
again and I'm just going to apply this
really really really close to the
waterline this is a brush from equal
tools you can get equal tools at
Walgreens or Walmart or anything like
that so I'm just applying this really
close to my waterline and then I'm going
to take Coco bear and on a pencil brush
I'm just going to go back and forth and
I'm going to buff that out so that the
colors can blend together nicely and it
could look nice and smoky underneath my
waterline then I'm going to take shimma
shimma
once again and I'm going to apply this
to my inner corners I wanted a really
really intense inner corner highlight
since the look is pretty much all matte
I thought it would look really pretty
with an intense shimmery inner corner
and then I'm just going to apply the
mascara to my bottom lashes and then we
are completely done with the eyes so to
finish off my face I'm going to take my
Jane bronzer this is in the shade
inspire and I'm just gonna bronze up my
face I didn't want to do a heavy contour
or anything like that I just wanted to
you know add some warmth it's a very
warm look I didn't want to do like a
heavy contour so just adding some
bronzer to the places you would
naturally contour though just to give a
little bit of definition
then I'm going to take a makeup geek
blush this is in the shade infatuation
definitely one of my top three favorite
makeup geek blushes ever it's amazing it
just gives a lot of warmth to the cheeks
because it's kind of bronzy at the same
time it's matte but it gives a warm
color to the cheeks I love this blush so
much it's amazing and incredible I love
it anyway moving on I'm just gonna take
shimma shimma again and I'm going to use
this as a highlight this is like one of
the most intense eyeshadows I have ever
used so it gives a really beautiful
intense highlight and you guys don't I
love my highlights so I just decided to
add it to my cheekbones because might as
well it was just there sitting in front
of me so that's why I used it as a
highlight so I'm highlighting my
cheekbones the bridge of my nose and my
Cupid's bow as well for lips I am taking
this colour-pop lippie pencil in the
shade skimpy and I am filling in all my
lips with this oil Philly
I am lip lining and then I'm filling in
my lips with this yes that's how you
would say it right yeah this is kind of
like a peachy nude a brownish peachy
nude a really beautiful lip liner and
then on top of that I am using the
colour-pop lippie stick in skimpy in the
same shade so it is a little bit lighter
and the in its glossy as well so this is
the lippy stick it's lighter and glossy
err and really really pretty I love this
combination I'm not a fan of skimpy
lippy stick by itself but with the
skimpy lippie pencil underneath it's a
nice combo did I lose anybody there
because I feel like I did
so I hope you really like this look I
think it's perfect for this time of year
I absolutely love it
