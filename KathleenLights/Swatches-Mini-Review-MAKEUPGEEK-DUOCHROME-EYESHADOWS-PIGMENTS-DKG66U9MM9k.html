mowing the lawn
Oh for today's video I'm just gonna walk
you through the brand new duochrome
collection by makeup geek she came out
with 12 brand new dual chrome eyes
shadows which if you don't know what
dual chrome is it's basically like two
colors in one these eyeshadows each have
a shift to them depending on how the
light catches it or depending on how you
move your eye or your face or whatever
you get two completely different colors
and it's very metallic hence the name
duo for two in chrome like very metallic
like that beautiful shift all of these
eyeshadows are incredible but before I
get into the review I will go ahead and
show you guys swatches and I will walk
you through all of them I will give you
a description of all of them she also so
she came out with 12 eyeshadows and then
she came out with eight duochrome
pigments now because these are pigments
these are even more intense than the
eyeshadows they have an intense duo
chrome finish to them I'm someone who
has all of the original makeup geek
pigments but she completely like changed
the packaging it has she has brand new
packaging now and I love it so much more
of a big complaint that people had when
it came to these makeup ich makeup geek
pigments that when you would open it
there would be like pigment everywhere
because it was just too full and it
didn't have a stopper or anything
now the pigments come with this little
guy right here it's like a stopper so
only the pigment comes out of this tiny
little hole which is really easy to take
out or to dip your brush in or swift it
into the cap so these new pigments are
not messy the packaging is really good I
love like the new caps they're really
pretty twelve new eyeshadows and eight
new dual chrome pigments a lot of people
were confused in my Instagram post but
the eyeshadows are six dollars each so
these dual chrome eyes shadows retail
for six HD pans
six bucks each and the pigments retail
for $12 each obviously they're bigger
they have a lot more product so they're
going to be more extensive so these are
$12 each both extremely affordable for
what you're getting there fantastic so
without further ado let's go
ahead and get into these swatches okay
so we are starting off with pigments
this first one is called sugar rush it
is a translucent base with icy blue and
purple reflux it's really really
beautiful all the way they're really
beautiful I'm gonna say that a hundred
times
okay let's move on so this next one is
kaleidoscope I really love the name of
this one I think it's a cute name so
this is a slate blue with pink purple
and teal reflex I'm trying my best to
get like all like all different
duochrome
angles as you can see with my hand I'm
trying I'm doing the most alright this
one is a huge favorite of mine it's
called wildfire it is a red coral base
with gold reflex
this one is called chameleon and it is a
deep teal base with gold reflux
this one is mood ring and it is a pale
gray bass with purple pink reflux this
one is so stunning by the way if you
hear like a dog's collar I have all
three of my dogs in my room as I'm
filming this voiceover so your warrant
this next one is called prism and it is
a white base with peachy pink reflux so
pretty much looks white but in certain
angles it looks like an intense peach
this one is really cool
this next one is called insomnia and it
is a pigment she already had in her like
line and it is a red brown base with
blue reflux this one is my all-time
favorite out of all of the pigments and
it is called hologram it's an orangey
pink base with green and gold reflux
this one in my opinion is a must-have
all of them are worth it but this one is
a must it's stunning okay so now we are
moving on to the eyeshadows the first
one here is called volt voltage at
trouble saying that voltage it is a
vanilla base with yellow reflex like
super intense Goldy yellow reflex to it
really cool this next one is called I'm
peach list and it is a buff base with
peachy pink reflex you can't really see
this one on my skin since the base color
is so close to my natural skin tone this
one is called phantom it is a white base
with violet purple reflex
this one is one of my favorites out of
the eyeshadows is called ritzy it's a
warm red Brown base with green gold
reflex
this one is called karma another
favorite of mine it is a golden base
with yellow-green reflux this one would
look so pretty all over the lid I love
this one a lot this one is called mai
tai and he reminds me a lot of an urban
decay eyeshadow I believe I'm not eggs I
don't remember what brand but I know
it's a dupe for a high-end one and it is
in apricot base with orange reflex
apricot apricot base okay I said that
weird this one is black light and it's
an electric purple base with icy blue
reflex this one is really really intense
like just one swipe when you're like
woah woah woah that's metallic this
one's real awesome this next one is
probably my favorite this one is Secret
Garden it's a deep espresso base with
bright teal reflex I mean they're all my
favorite I can't say that this one's my
favorite favorite but it's so beautiful
like a really deep really pretty color
this one is called havoc it's a warm red
brown base with teal reflux
this is also my cup of tea because of
that warm reddish base I love colors
like that I'll probably be using this
one a ton so this one is called typhoon
and it's a deep teal base with green and
gold reflux
this one is rockstar and it's also an
eyeshadow she already all hat like had
in her collection and it is a medium
silver base with purple pink reflex
this last one is called steampunk and it
is a black base with rich copper reflux
this is another favorite of mine and
also a must-have it is stunning
