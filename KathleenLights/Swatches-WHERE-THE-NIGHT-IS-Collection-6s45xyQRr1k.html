I'm like sweating and this always
happens to me when I sit down and film
these kinds of videos like I get major
anxiety and like my I'm sweating in like
my boob area I'm sweating all over the
place but today's video is very very
very special to me because it is the day
where I talk all about this guy and
these guys so if you guys follow me on
Instagram then you already know what I'm
talking about and you've already seen
swatches and if you tell yesterday's
video then you already know as well but
I have teamed up with colour-pop once
again to come up with a brand new little
collection and I'm so happy with it so
this is what the quad looks like and the
quad is called where the night is which
have you been following me for a long
time you guys know that I had come out
with a quad a few months back
like back in April with colour-pop
called where the light is and this is
what it looks like so where the light is
and now has a new sexy sister I am so
proud of this quad specifically because
when I did this one when I did the where
the light is quad I really had a vision
in mind that I wanted it very natural I
mean there is like a really intense gold
and a nice glittery brown but Cornelius
is a very matte light shade and glow is
a matte white I wanted something that
was very soft and wearable for everyday
but when it came to wear the night is I
knew that I wanted something bold and
different and I'm gonna get into the
names and how I came up with the names
and how I came up with the whole thing
here in a second but I quickly did want
to tell you guys that this is now
available if you do follow me on
Instagram this is now available to
purchase right now it went live today
December 26 and I will link it down
below I will link the quad and the lip
products down below you know the quad is
$20 and the lippy stick and lippy
pencils there are five dollars each so
very very affordable I will have the
colour-pop website down below so you
guys can check it out and I have
something really really really really
exciting to talk about so now all of the
eyeshadows sold in my quads can be
purchased in
visually you can get all eight of these
eyeshadows individually so if you like
three from here and you like two from
here you can buy five of those five
eyeshadows you know you don't have to
commit to the quads but I will say that
if you guys are into it like if you
already have this because before you
couldn't buy these individually go if
you already have this and you're like
ooh I want the sister you know I want
the packaging you have to buy the whole
thing in order to get the box so if you
only like one eyeshadow then only buy
one of the eyeshadows or if you don't
like any of them don't buy any of them
but you know what I mean so let's say
you only like one of them you can buy
that single eyeshadow alone and then
that's it but you don't get like the
cute little packaging which I really
really love so if you do like all four
then just go ahead and buy the quad
because you get the cool box to go with
it so then you can have like the little
sisters together so I'm firstly going to
go ahead and swatch and talk about the
or the nidus box and then I'll go into
the lip products but I did want to tell
you guys really quickly about that that
you can buy um
these eyeshadows individually because I
get tweets all the time saying like oh
my gosh I hit pan on blaze blazes my
favorite eyeshadow but I don't want to
buy the entire quad all over again for
one eyeshadow which now you can do that
so if there's one in here that you've
hit pan on and that you've used the
whole thing up and never wanted to
commit to getting all of them again you
can purchase that one shadow you could
do it okay so moving on here we are this
is where the night is and it's so funny
I really quickly want to tell you guys
about how I came up with this name so
originally we were only going to do
three eyeshadows we were gonna do them
and they were gonna be sold individually
and it wasn't gonna be a quad and then I
was sitting at home or sitting here I'm
not home yet I was sitting here and I
was watching Breaking Bad with Danny and
I was eating popcorn and for some reason
my mind just wandered and I was like how
cool would it be if I made one more
eyeshadow with color pop like if we did
four eyeshadows and we made a quad and I
named it where the night is like for
some reason it just hit me one night
watching Breaking Bad and I immediately
text Jordan which is my friend over at
colour-pop and I gave her the idea and
she's like I love that idea let me run
it by the peeps at colour-pop and they
love the idea too so I feel like I feel
so proud of this because it was just an
idea I had like one night watching
Breaking Bad like the name of this and I
thought it was cute and clever since I
already had where the light is and I'm
very very very very proud of it and I
came up with that name because I had
already chosen three like nighttime
shades to be honest these aren't really
like nighttime shades these are just
shades that I personally would wear at
night I mean I would wear these during
the day as well Who am I kidding but I
like them for like nighttime going out
kind of colors so this is what the box
looks like and you just open the top and
here are the eyeshadows and I love them
so very much and you just open up this
little bottle something just fall right
out so I'm gonna go one by one and tell
you guys the colors and how I came up
with the name so I'm going to start with
my all-time favorite one out of all four
of them and it isn't this one right here
and it is a really really stunning rose
gold and this one is called wienie which
I knew is a really really weird name
when I created the where the light is
quad I named one of the eyeshadows
Cornelius because Cornelius is my oldest
dog and I love him so much so I knew
when I created another quad that I
wanted to include my other two dogs in
the quad as well so I decided to name
the pink one after my little weenie girl
so this one is named weeny after Selene
I was getting tons of questions on
Instagram like wow why didn't you name
one of them Selene like way to go you
named one Porter and one Cornelius screw
Selene but actually weenie is named
after Selene if you guys have been
following me for a really long time and
I'm talking like a really long time like
when I adopted Selene I adopted Selene
from the Humane Society and I was going
back and forth on Twitter I didn't know
what to name her I personally wanted to
name Selene hazel like that was the name
I wanted to name her like the second I
saw her I knew I wanted her name to be
hazel and
didn't want her name to be hazel and he
was hell-bent on naming her Selene um
from the girl from underworld her name
is Celine he loves that movie so he was
like I really want to lean I really want
to lean in really was lean mm-hmm and I
wanted hazel but in his defense I named
Porter and Cornelius oh you know her
name of course ended up being Selene
which now I look at her and I can't
picture her like having any other name
like to me she's a Selene but I hated it
so much in the beginning that I would
just call her my Cellini wienie and I
would like dr. really call you're my
little Cellini weenie that it just stuck
so we've been calling her that
ever since now it just kind of referred
to her as weenie or silly it depends so
yeah that one is weenie and it's
definitely my favorite one colour-pop
has another rose gold eyeshadow called
Lala but it has a lot more copper to it
this one is more of like a true rose
gold and I love it and it's so beautiful
I will link a tutorial down below where
I use this like in the center of my lid
yesterday so tomorrow and it was like a
halo eye beautiful I love this shade so
yes anyway moving on this one is a
really really intense like chartreuse
color it's a little bit of green and a
little bit of gold like combined in one
this is actually the eyeshadow I'm
wearing on my lid
I have other eye shadows of course but
like the main pop of color on my lid is
this bad boy right here this tutorial
will be up sometime next week I think on
Monday but I'm not exactly sure yet but
anyway I love this shade this is
probably the most bold or the most like
unwearable but I wanted something really
unique that I don't really have in my
collection the reason I came up with
this eyeshadow is cuz I was googling
this is really weird but I was googling
um like uh red carpet dresses but like
celebrities have worn and I found this
dress that was this exact color and he
was described as a like chartreuse color
so I started googling like things that
were the color of short truce and I sent
them to like Jordan at color pop and I
was like I want something exactly like
this and they did it exactly how I
envisioned it and this one is called
telepathy and I know that
seems like a really weird name like that
has nothing to do with me I don't know
it's the first name that came to mind so
I just went with my gut feeling and I
named it telepathy I'm strange like that
this one can be very wearable if you
pair it with like bronzy or gold shades
like you can make this wearable you can
even put this like on the lower lashline
as a pop of color and have like
something very neutral and natural on
the top so yes I love this eyeshadow
okay so this next one is named after my
third dog I have three dogs and it is
called Porter which is my tiny little
Yorkie out of all my dogs he's the one
that's like attached to me like by the
hip like he doesn't leave my side my
other dogs are more independent and like
have a life but I am Porter's life he's
like can I be with you all day please
also speaking of which Porter my party
boy came to say I know Gideon me
generate a puppy you have an eye shadow
named after you how do you feel about
that so this is the first eyeshadow I
came up with like when colour-pop
approached me to do like three shades
this was the first one in my mind and I
wanted a really really really deep
reddish burgundy with a ton of like gold
glitter in it and it also has like pink
glitters in it as well you can't really
tell unless you're really really up
close but it has a bunch of little pink
sparkles in it too and I love this shade
so much this is also the eye shot I used
all over my lid in yesterday's tutorial
there's just so many ways you can wear
this eye shadow because it doesn't have
a sheen to it I mean there's glitter in
it but it doesn't have like a weird
sheen so you could even use this like on
the outer corners and like drag this
into your crease and it's not gonna look
weird or shimmery it's just gonna look a
little bit like glittery and fun and I
really love it on the lower lash line it
looks so incredible on the lower lash
line I love it I love it there's so many
ways you could use this eyeshadow and
then last but certainly not least is
this bad boy right here and this one is
called midnight and all I told Jordan
was I want a black like a black bass
with a crap-ton of gold glitter so much
glitter that you could barely even tell
that it's black and then this came out
and if you look really closely it has a
bunch of little purple glitters in it as
well which I think gives it a cool
little unique twist you can tell unless
you're really close to it but I love
love love love love this eyeshadow it
kind of looks like a vintage black gold
it looks so pretty all over the lid I
will be doing a tutorial using this
shade as like the main focus coming up
soon and I love it and I named it
midnight because it just I don't know it
remind I don't know I reminded me of
midnight again I'm something that if it
just pops into my head that's what I go
with and it just popped into my head
midnight when I initially swatch this
eyeshadow on Instagram a lot of people
thought that it looked really similar to
blaze but they're actually like
completely different this one's more
black and blazes like 100% a bronze
color they just both have a ton of
glitter in it okay so those were all the
eyeshadows in my where the night is box
now I'm gonna talk about the lippie stix
I came out with so I have two lippie
stix and two matching
lippy pencils and I'm going to talk
about the nude first I've been wanting
to come out with like a nude shade for a
while now and to be honest I don't think
anything will replace Lumiere in my
heart I think to me Lumiere is like my
perfect creation I love Lumiere it's at
the top of my list but I really freaking
love this one and this one is called
Aquarius and if you guys didn't know I
am an Aquarius my birthday is January
27th so I named this one Aquarius and
this is a really really pretty nude
shade I don't exactly know how to
describe it to me it's like a neutral
nude it's not to like Bobby it's not too
pink it's not to like brown it's it's a
neutral nude and I love it it goes with
so many different looks I wore it in
yesterday's tutorial and this is a cream
finish my favorite finishes from
colour-pop are the matte ones but I
wanted the nude to have like a gloss to
it because so many people when they put
on nude lipstick they top it off with
like a nude gloss anyway because I think
nude lips look really pretty matte but I
also think they look really pretty
glossy so I decided to come out with
like a cream finish it's not necessarily
there because I think they have a glossy
finish but it's very very creamy and it
has a
really really pretty shine to it I just
I love the finish of this I'm so happy
that I went with a cream instead of a
matte and the lip liner is different the
lip liner is a little bit more pink it's
still a nude but it has a little bit of
a stronger pink undertone then this does
this one is like straight-up neutral
this is a little bit pink e'er F
swatches on Instagram where I'm wearing
this by itself I'm also wearing this by
itself and then I have a picture wearing
both of them combined so that is
Aquarius they're both called the queries
by the way but this is Aquarius and then
the other lippy stickin pence what came
out with are these and these are called
Taurus and if you guys didn't know
Danny's birthday is May 2nd he's a
Taurus so I decided to name this one
Taurus and this one is a really really
warm brown it's a little bit deep it's a
dark brown but it's not like super dark
it's not like limbo from colour-pop or
like the Kylie lip kit in true brown
which is like super dark this one is a
little bit lighter and a little bit
warmer it has a lot of warmth to it
which is what I envisioned I wanted like
a super warm brown and this is a matte
finish so so beautiful these were so
comfortably on the lips this is like
unlike any other matte lips like I have
they're so incredibly comfortable I love
the colour-pop matte lip ease I love
them and then the lip liner is actually
not as warm so the lip liner looks like
a true dark brown not like super dark
but it's definitely a true Brown whereas
the lippy stick is a lot warmer so on
Instagram I also have a picture wearing
this by itself wearing this one by
itself and then combined because the
swatch I'm about to show you is actually
these two products combined and just
like the swatch you saw of Aquarius not
that long ago was these two products
combined as well so yeah those were the
swatches and the names of the shades a
lot of you guys wanted to know how I
came up with the shades how I came up
with the names so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and it wasn't weird
but I do want to say thank you thank you
