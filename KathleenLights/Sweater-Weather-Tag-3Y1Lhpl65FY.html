and it is the sweater weather tag I'm
sure you guys have seen this time before
it is going around YouTube right now and
I just think it's so cute I know tag
videos aren't for everybody not a lot of
people don't like to watch them but I
really do and if you don't that's okay
but that is what this video is going to
be about I wanted to film today since it
was my day off and I didn't really know
what to film I kind of like writer's
block but like vlogger block I just
didn't know what to film and I
remembered that I really like this time
and that I wanted to film it so that's
what I'm doing which by the way I'm
trying my best to upload more frequently
it's just that since it's the holiday
season I have been working more hours at
work and it's just getting a little
hectic but hopefully when everything
calms down I'll be uploading a lot more
I also partially wanted to record to
show you guys that I decorated my desk
not very well but I decorated my desk I
don't know if you remember but I had
like the little pumpkins with the red
flowers and I kept that through
Thanksgiving and since it's now getting
closer to Christmas I wanted to do more
Christmassy kind of decorations and I
just love the whole white Christmas look
my Christmas tree is like blue and
silver and everything I love the whole
silvery look and I am obsessed with this
snow globe I got at Hobby Lobby like so
cute it's a snowflake
I love snowflakes like I'm obsessed with
anything that has a snowflake on it and
I know that I know you guys love the
glitter jars I had back there but they
were just so messy I did everything to
keep the glitter on them like I googled
today hair sprayed it I trust me I did
everything I could to keep the glitter
on them but no matter how secure it was
I would get glitter all over my brushes
all over my makeup it was just I got
tired of it I was like good enough I
can't do this anymore so I switched them
out and I got these really cute candle
holders at Hobby Lobby but anyway this
isn't a vanity tour so let me just go on
into the actual video and the questions
pulled up on my phone so let's get
started favorite candle scent okay so I
know that every one shows a bath and
Bodyworks candle when it comes to this
question like everyone and I really do
love bath and Bodyworks candles they're
amazing but they are a little expensive
so I always get them when it's like the
deal too
420 or something like that I don't
remember but I'm obsessed with Glade
candles like I buy Glade candles all the
time and they're one of the few candles
I feel that actually make my house smell
good some candles I don't smell them
it's really weird but Glade candles are
awesome and the candle that I have been
obsessing over recently I got like a
week and a half ago and it's gone it's
like nothing left Danny
burnt the crap out of this thing like he
was obsessed with this candle but I got
a bunch of other stuff in this scent I
got like 12 Glade plugins to put all
over my house I got like the candle I
got spray stuff like I love this scent
it's the pure vanilla joy and I am a big
vanilla lover but there is something
like there's a difference between this
and like regular vanilla this smells
like a warm cookie vanilla like a
Christmas even illa as opposed to like
the French vanilla it smells like a like
another type of vanilla okay
I'm not making sense obsessed my entire
house smells like this definitely go out
and smell the pure vanilla joy candle
because like if you're having a little
over you are going to love this coffee
tea or hot chocolate coffee I'm addicted
to coffee it's gotten really bad I drink
coffee every day I am addicted to it and
since I suffer from like a lot of
anxiety and all that stuff it's not good
for me to drink so much coffee yet I
cannot stop what's the best fall memory
you have definitely Danny Danny and I
got married in the fall so automatically
whenever I think of the fall season I
think of Danny since we got married so
Danny was my is my favorite fall memory
which makeup trendy prefer dark lips or
winged eyeliner both best fragrance for
fall
Gucci by Gucci definitely 100% Gucci by
Gucci it smells so elegant and classy
and like rich and sophisticated and
girly and feminine like a woman it
doesn't smell like strong or like old
ladyish but it smells really really
classy and I just think that it's
perfect for this time
here go out to your local Macy's and
smell this I think they might have this
at Sephora - I don't know but go smell
this cuz it's my favorite Thanksgiving
food I don't feel like NATO got any
white gold but no my little just kidding
that's just what everybody eats for
Thanksgiving in Miami like my entire
family I'm Hispanic that's all they eat
like they don't eat stuffing and like
cornbread that doesn't happen in Miami
but my all-time Thanksgiving food is
mashed potatoes mashed potatoes is one
of my favorite foods of all time
regardless I'm sure my sister is
watching this right now and is like yeah
I get mashed potatoes at every
restaurant I'm obsessed with mashed
potatoes but I just feel like it's the
perfect side dish to Turkey like if you
know how much potatoes on Thanksgiving
like I mean what's Thanksgiving what is
autumn weather where you live really
cold I am not used to cold weather at
all since Miami is like an inferno in
the middle of December so the fact that
where I live is like 36 degrees right
now it's it's killing me guys other than
Mississippi right now and honestly it's
hard the autumn here is hard and I'm
sure it's people who live in Mississippi
they're like this is nothing but I I get
cold at like 60 degrees I mean most worn
sweater to be honest my most worn
sweater is like my Kardashian tracksuit
I wear that every day since it's so cold
here I don't care I go everywhere in
that tracksuit because it's like really
really warm but I have been wearing this
one a lot lately
it's my favorite cuz it's so long and
has like the cute little patter and I
have just been wearing it all the time
must-have nail polish this fall I
haven't worn nail polish in weeks and I
know that that's just gross I hate naked
nails but my nails chips so easily at my
job because I'm constantly like opening
boxes with a box cutter and like my nail
breaks every five minutes it's just I've
been having to repaint my nails so often
since I've been working there and I just
I got fed up and I was like no I'm not
doing it anymore I'm just kidding I am
gonna be painting my nails soon it's
just so hard to keep up with them but it
seems like every fall in winter this is
my gold
nail polish it is my sinful colors and
it's called last chance it is a really
really really dark green it almost looks
black but definitely in the Sun you see
that it's green you can definitely tell
it's green in the bottle it's green but
it is a beautiful color I'd be
complimented on this nail polish every
single time I wear it and the best part
is these things are like two dollars at
Walgreens can be that football games are
jumping in leaf piles considering I'm
not a football fan and the only football
game I've ever watched completely was
the friend football game where they all
play football in the yard on
Thanksgiving and that's not a real
football game so I'm gonna go with
jumping in leaf piles skinny jeans or
leggings definitely leggings I love
skinny jeans I really do I wear them all
the time but if I can wear leggings
every single day for the rest of my life
I would wear that I am a casual comfy
girl at heart like I dress for comfort
as long as it looks cute and it's
comfortable I will wear it so leggings
are pretty much everything I wear combat
boots or Uggs
combat boots I love combat boots I think
they're so like edgy and like street
style I love that style it's so cute
it's pumpkin spice worth the hype
abso-freakin'-lutely don't you pretend
and say you don't like pumpkin spice
don't you pretend favorite fall TV show
um I don't know I'm a big show watcher
so definitely the Vampire Diaries right
now Vampire Diaries is so good right now
I can and revenge revenge came back like
on Sunday and I'm just so good but I
think the Vampire Diaries it's like both
of them right here
mmm the Vampire Diaries a little bit
more by the way if you watch The Vampire
Diaries comment down below I want to
know if your team's dilemma or team
Delana Dilla as I say I don't know I am
team Selena 100% I feel like everyone is
team Damon like everybody wants her with
Damon yes
I went through that face but no her true
love is Stefan and I don't care what
anybody tells me what song really gets
you into the fall spirit I don't know if
this song is really old or new or semi
old or new I don't know but it is
stubborn love by the Lumineers I am
obsessed with this song right now I
heard it on a commercial like two weeks
ago and now it's like the only thing I
listen to but this song is so good it
reminds me of Christmas for some weird
reason well maybe because I heard it for
the first time two weeks ago so but
honestly I love the lyrics I will link
the song down below go listen to it and
read the lyrics it's like such a
beautiful song
totally loving the Lumineers right now
