random facts about me tag
I like this tag it's cool basically you
just quickly say 50 random things about
yourself and I'm going to try to do this
as quickly as I can I am the biggest
scaredy-cat on the face of this planet
I'm pretty much afraid of everything
except like marshmallows and puppies and
stuff like that when I was a little girl
my brother my sister used to tell me
that my mom had a twin sister with red
hair who lived in Hawaii and they always
used to tell me that the sister who
lived in Hawaii was really their mother
so we had different mothers I've seen
every single American action will be in
the entire world and I know all of the
songs like I can sing every mary-kate
nasty song verbatim in seventh grade all
the seventh grade teachers had like a
voting who was best dressed best
personality all that stuff and I won
best eyes which I didn't even know was a
category but I won that category which
is kind of cool I am obsessed with dogs
puppies wrinkly old dogs any dog I am
obsessed with I'm a huge animal lover on
its own but dogs are my life when I was
a little girl I took out all the
cushions from the sofa and I put them on
the floor and I was jumping on them one
by one and for some reason I had a
pencil in my hand that didn't have an
eraser so it was a sharp metal and I
tripped and fell and the pencil went
straight into my mouth and made a giant
gash in the back of my throat and I had
a whole dismay my dad told me once that
I was named after Kathleen Turner but I
don't know how true that is I'm obsessed
with anything cherry-flavored yet I
absolutely hate cherries my first crush
ever was Jonathan Taylor Thomas
home-improvement
he was beautiful to me when I was
younger and till this day he still holds
a big place in my heart my favorite
thing in the world to do besides makeup
is writing I love writing creative
writing with my favorite subjects and
I'm currently in the middle of writing a
book I think Jack's Mannequin is
probably the best band in the entire
world I was extremely sheltered as a kid
my dad didn't let me do anything or go
anywhere and my friend Omar used to call
my house the force field where I was
never allowed to leave I hate cake Oreos
and chocolate-chip cookies I have a
goddaughter her name is Alyssa and she
is what I hope my future daughter will
be like when I was a little kid we had
field day like at the end of the year
where all the kids got together and
played sports and did a bunch of stuff
and since I was extremely uncoordinated
I was only a part of tug-of-war and I
was at the back of the rope when I
slipped and fell and the kid in front of
me stepped on my face I cried every day
on the first day of school up until
fourth grade I really hate going ice
skating because my biggest fear is
falling on the floor and getting my
fingers chopped off as somebody skates
by
when I was younger I was in love with
Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon and I'm not
talking like oh I liked 62 masks no I
was in love I had dreams about Tuxedo
Mask
I named my dog Cornelius which is the
main guy in a movie Thumbelina which was
one of my favorite movies growing up
when I was in high school I used to talk
in a British accent almost every single
day and all my friends absolutely loved
it and used to ask me to talk like this
all the time bats are probably the
scariest things I've ever seen
I can eat butterscotch candies for the
rest of my life
when I was a little kid my sister really
enjoyed sitting on my head whenever I
annoyed her or something I don't know my
cousin Janine and I had this like
obsession with these little bugs
we called them tickle bugs I don't know
if that's what their name was and we
used to catch them and keep them in our
little crayon box add some leaves and we
would call those our pets everyone used
to tell me that I look exactly like
Hannah Montana
I can literally recite all the words to
the little rascals The Parent Trap and
Peter Pan I have extremely pointy ears
as you
see and I have been called leprechaun
elf gremlin Furby avatar something from
Lord of the Rings and many of the things
that have pointy ears Gary Sinise is my
favorite actor of all time I just love
that man with every inch of my being
like I I love Gary Sinise I'm 21 years
old and I have never been to a club
before one time I was with my friend and
I was eating a chicken sandwich from
McDonald's and she said something so
funny that I could not stop laughing and
a piece of chicken came out of my nose I
plan to go full on blonde in the future
but I'm really really afraid I was like
damaged and the maintenance and how I
would look as a blonde I know it's
really weird but I cannot take a shower
if I have chapstick on my lips if I get
in the shower and I just feel water
touching my face while I have chapstick
on it's just weird and then it gets
messy and I just that is something that
grosses me out
so much and I don't know why when I was
younger I stood on my couch and I did
this and close my eyes and threw myself
forward don't ask me why but that's how
I have this tiny scar on my chin middle
school was a very dark time for me I
would say it was filled with 20% good
memories and 80% embarrassing moment I
get seriously emotionally invested with
TV shows when Michael Scofield dive in
Prison Break I cried for three days
being around little kids makes me really
really nervous that they're gonna fall
or something is going to happen to them
in my present and I can't handle that
when I was younger my cousin Janine and
I ate an entire thing of tums because we
thought it was candy and we drink a
bunch of champagne because we thought it
was apple juice seriously where were her
parents when I was younger and I would
go to Disney World I used to think that
the Beast costume was like the scariest
thing in the world and in every picture
where my mom is posing next to like
beauty at the Beast I'm like I was a
major pushover in high school I just
kind of let
anybody say anything to me and that
changed when I met Danny and he was like
girl we got to fix that when I was
little Barney was everything I can't
tell you how many times I've gotten oh
my god I thought you were so mean before
I met you I've got to met so many times
because people say that I have like a
mean face I don't see it and then they
got to know me and they're like oh
you're gonna go me there
I get really depressed whenever I watch
a movie where a dog dies so if there's a
dog in the movie I always check spoilers
make sure the dog doesn't die because if
they do I will not watch that movie one
time um my cousin my grandma and my
friend and I were all playing dominoes
dominoes is like a Hispanic game I guess
I don't know what I'm doing here but my
grandma has fake teeth and one time when
we were playing dominoes I told her to
do this and she did it don't know why
but her cheese went flying right into my
little cousins face I cannot for the
life of me sleep with socks on it
literally freaks me out the thought of
having my feet like when I was 10 I
found out that Santa Claus didn't exist
and I really thought that my entire life
up to that point was just one big lie
when I was like 13 or 14 I saw the movie
13 ghosts which traumatized me so
severely that after that I just can't
see scary movies and The Jackal still
haunts me till this day when I was in
third grade I was obsessed with one of
Madonna's CDs and one of the last days
of school we were able to bring a CD
that we liked and when I got there I
told my teacher to play like a virgin
and she was so offended by that but I
had no idea what a virgin wasn't third
grade so I was really confused and
thinking about it another so funny
I really really hate cinnamon buns so
much that even the smell makes me want
to gag for some reason no one can
pronounce my name correctly in Miami
they always used to call me
Faline and it bothered me so much how
hard is it to say kathleen its kathleen
there's no a in between it's not
kathleen Butterfinger babies were like
my favorite candy of all time and it
still breaks my heart that they just
don't make them anymore i don't know why
i was a genius
candy okay guys that was it these were
50 random facts about me this tag was so
hard I had to like sit there and think
