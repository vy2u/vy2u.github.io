bag tag and I'm ashamed of myself for
even doing this tag because my purse is
beat up like you're gonna look at it and
be like honey no but I thought you know
what whatever just do it anyway
who cares so that's what I'm doing
be nice this is my purse and it looks a
lot bigger on camera it's not big it's
like one of those one of these little
guys so it's not very big it doesn't
hold a whole lot and it doesn't look
like it to beat up on camera but when I
turn it these little things yeah it's
coming apart it's it's not doing good
it's not doing good guys
um no this is not a real boy baton my
friend got this from New York it's like
is he called Chinatown I don't know I've
never been to New York but I know that
that thing's gonna get all the person
stuff yeah so my friend was the one who
gave it to me
actually it was hers and I borrowed it
so much that she was just like just take
it just go just take it and I'm kind of
a hoarder I did clean out my purse
before I did this only like receipts and
stuff I just took out I had like a
thousand receipt ID there just crumble
receipts and throw them in there I don't
know what that says about me but that's
what I do so I did sing other receipts
but everything else that's in here I do
carry this in my purse every single day
oh and also the zipper broke
it does not close I think it's time for
a new purse I don't know if there's like
a specific thing you show first in these
videos you know like keys and then this
and this so I'm just gonna go magician
style and just pull stuff out and just
go from there
okay so I keep my Juicy Couture glasses
with me at all times I cannot see from
far I don't wear them ever because I'm
extremely in denial but I do need
glasses not that there's anything wrong
with them it's just that glasses give me
a headache no matter what kind of
glasses they are they just really give
me a headache so they look like this
becoming a little pink case that I drew
on because I got them when I was like 15
and
on everything when I was I've seen and
ruin that so they just look like this
and they're I don't know what the
prescription is uh yeah so Wow I keep my
glasses in my purse as of course keep my
keys in my purse like everyone else does
um to my car into my house I have my
little Eiffel Tower I'm obsessed with
the Eiffel Tower and I have my little
Eiffel Tower keychain and a picture of
Danny when he was like three I'm gonna
say wasn't he the cutest little thing
well I think so so yeah those are my
keys
oh I also keep my sunglasses in here
which I don't have a case for cuz they
were given to me by my cousin um yeah he
just gave them to me like here and well
these anymore
and I absolutely love them they are fake
ray-bans you're like wow girl is any of
your stuff real no because if I can get
them cheaper and they look like ray-bans
hey why not so that's why I'm not so
bummed out about having a case cuz they
were like really cheap they're fake and
if they break I mean whatever they're
not real I also keep my wallet in here
um like everyone else keeps in their
purse but yeah this is just a huge
wallet I love really really big wallets
and I got mine at JC Penney like a
little two years ago I think I got it
and I love it because it's justice it's
is huge I love this okay before I show
you the next thing do not judge me this
is gonna be so awkward to show you I
should have lied and just taken this out
and then pretended like I don't walk
around with this in my purse but I keep
I keep this heart jewelry box thing
and okay guys the reason why I keep it's
getting broken it's like breaking it
just which is kidding me the reason why
I keep this is because a Danny was on
deployment in Africa and he brought this
to me when he came back from Africa and
then I kept it in my purse like when he
gave it to me I put it in my purse and
for some reason let me see he went to
Africa in 2011 Oh dr. easy take it easy
Oh God he went to Africa I think it was
cells in 11 no oh my god I'm horrible
wife the point is that ever since he
gave this to me I've kept it in my purse
and for some reason I cannot take it out
now
even if I switch purses this has to go
with me everywhere and he thinks that
I'm really strange and that that's not
normal but he's probably right and that
heart alone takes up like half of this
purse but you know what I keep Kleenex
in my purse just in case you never know
it's a splash and go moist wipes it's
alcohol free and it's for your hands and
for your face and stuff just in case you
know it's good to have you think umm I
keep my dark kiss a fine fragrance mist
that I showed in my April April
favorites always in my purse um I keep a
hand sanitizer this is just hand
sanitizer from target like regular old
hand sanitizer because that's good to
have right
oh I keep my ipod in here but I don't
keep my earphones in here because Danny
got me beats
when he was in Guam and sure beats are
cool but they're like this big and they
don't fit in my purse it's bad enough
that I keep a giant heart in my purse my
beats don't fit in there so I just keep
my ipod which what's the point right but
I keep my phone in there anyway oh I
keep some advil in here because you
never know when you're gonna have a
headache I also have this tiny little
thing that I got from CVS you keep like
pills in here and I used to take vitamin
E every single day I haven't taken it I
don't know why I've just gotten lazy I
just haven't taken my I haven't been
taking it but I used to keep my vitamin
E in here in here and I used to take it
every single day should this you should
do that keep doing that so the last
thing I have in my purse is this what do
you call these things I can't remember I
know what they're called but here's
where I have like all my goodies I like
to call them I'll go ahead and show you
I have a bunch of stuff that I don't
know I find necessary to have I guess in
my purse I have my favorite lotion it's
the johnson's melt away stress lavender
chamomile lotion helps you unwind and
feel at ease I hate putting lotion on my
whole life since I was a little girl I
never like the feeling of lotion in my
hands it just it drove me crazy but this
one I can handle I can handle I can
handle a few as long as they're not
already greasy I can put them on and you
know I could deal with it this one's not
greasy at all and it just smells like
lavender like that lavender and
chamomile smell no you know what well I
guess it does smell this smells exactly
like baby like baby shampoo like that oh
my god that baby you know just mind I
think of babies that smells like babies
I also keep a blistex chapstick it's the
medicated one it has SPF 15 and it's
minty but usually unlike mint but this
one's really good because it's one of
those that if your lips are chapped and
you put it on your lips it feels like
really tingly like it's burning in it
for some reason I like that oh I also
keep my a OS hand lotion this one is
also not greasy at all and it smells
amazing I love how this one smells and
it's cute it looks like a little like a
little egg I don't I really like it so I
keep that in here um I also keep date
quill
you must think like advil and mmm just
just in case I keep day Cola I mean I
keep my favorite lip product of all time
it's the blistex
by the way ballistics is my favorite
brand of chapstick they're amazing I
keep this it's like a little stackable
thing and it's the revive and restore
like this one's reviving this one's
restore and this one tastes kind of
minty but I like it because it's really
really thin so it's good for just like a
simple chapstick like under your
lipstick and stuff it's like the EOS
ones that are really thin and not like
so thick but this one is my absolute
favorite this one is thick and this is
really good when you have extremely
chapped lips this fixes them overnight
like I will put this on at night and in
the morning the next day my lips feel
like butter it's so soft and the smell
of this I can smell this all day oh my
god this smells amazing and they're cute
and they're stackable revive and restore
little blistex things I like this I also
keep earrings in my little bag just in
case I can't tell you how many times
I've left my house and I'm like ah back
I didn't put earrings on happens to me
all the time and I cannot be without
earrings I just feel like if you're
gonna put on any jewelry vote for me if
you're if I'm gonna have any jewelry on
I want to have earrings on I don't know
I also keep my little Juicy Couture this
one is Viva La Juicy this is the only
to get to a perfume I like I feel like
the first I don't like the first one but
this one's heavenly oh my god this
smells so good and I keep the little one
in my purse it's like about to finish
but you know I like to keep tiny little
perfumes in my purse and I keep up bobby
pins and little rubber bands in here I
keep a bunch of them in here because
again you never know what can happen
wouldn't it you might need bobby pins or
little rubber bands one day and the last
thing i keep in here is this eiffel
tower bottle opener okay
I'm not a drinker I don't go around
those popping bottles and drinking all
day but my cousin gave me this for
Christmas and I think it's the most
beautiful thing did I mention that I
have a eiffel tower obsession I do I
just think it's the most beautiful thing
like even if it had no purpose if it
wasn't a bottle opener I would still
keep this it's awesome but it has come
in handy you know someone's like oh crap
I'm I'm bottle opener Mike hey here you
go
beer but yeah I don't really I don't I
don't drink guys I'm really I don't have
this in here cuz I'm an alcoholic I
really I don't drink ever ever okay guys
so that's it that's everything I keep in
my first I also keep my phone in my
purse but I mean I keep that with me if
I'm home thank you so much for watching
