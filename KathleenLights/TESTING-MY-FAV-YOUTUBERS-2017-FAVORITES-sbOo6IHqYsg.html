exciting it's a full face of first
impressions but not just any full face
worse impressions I'm actually trying
out all of my favorite youtubers yearly
favorites since I started watching
YouTube my favorite YouTube videos to
watch our monthly favorites and yearly
favorites there's just something about
those videos I love and especially
yearly favorites there's something so
exciting about watching my favorite
youtubers talk about like one item in
each category because we try out so many
things and throughout the entire year
we're constantly testing out so much
makeup so when people really narrow down
their favorites I just get really
excited I've been watching all of my
favorite youtubers really favorites for
weeks now and I picked out products from
everyone's video that I hadn't tried out
yet because I'm not gonna lie I've tried
out the majority of everybody's
favorites but there were a few products
I just hadn't tried out yet so I
accumulated all of them and I have a
full face of makeup here I love how this
look turned out I discovered a lot of
good stuff and I really really want to
know your guys's yearly favorites I know
that you mentioned some of them in my
yearly favorites video like in the
comments but I really want you to
comment down below in this video and let
me know out of the entire year what was
your like Holy Grail product and if I
haven't turned it out before I'm gonna
go out and purchase it and I'm gonna do
this same type of video only with my
subscribers yearly favorites I was
totally inspired to do this video
because Jamie Page Beauty just posted a
video not that long ago testing out all
of her subscribers favorites I
definitely want to do that as well so
let me know in the comments below
doesn't have to be just in 2017 like
your all-time favorite favorite product
that you haven't seen me use before I
think that would be really really fun
ignore my background I'm still working
on it I still have to hang up a bunch of
things I want to hang up on the wall
it's still a hot mess but anyway I'm
gonna leave everybody's channel down
below every youtuber I mentioned in this
video I'm gonna link their channel below
so you can check them out I highly
recommend watching all of them and if I
mention them they'll be down below so
yes if you want to see how to get this
look and if you want to see my thoughts
and my first impressions on all this
makeup and just keep watching okay so
we're gonna start off with primer
and I have a little bit of a situation
with that usually I'll just go in with
one primer but I have three to test out
the first one I'm going to use is the
farce Ollie unicorn essence this is a
skin enhancing antioxidant serum that
you can use underneath your makeup
I heard Rosita talk about this beauty by
Rosita here on YouTube I loved her so
much not gonna lie to us like that I'm a
little bit I'm a little bit worried I
always see people dripping this all over
their face on Instagram and I'm like but
she's sorry but she says she loves using
this as a primer she puts it on her face
and then leaves it there for a couple
minutes and then she says it gets nice
and sticky and that it's a really great
base for makeup so I'm just gonna apply
a little bit of this I'm gonna do the
Instagram look the Internet is weird so
I'm just gonna tap this in oh my gosh
this smells the wit genius Wow
this kind of oh my gosh you know what
this smells like well not when you smell
it in the bottle but when you're
applying it to your face it kind of
smells like the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer or like the chocolate bar
palette oh my gosh this does get really
sticky mmm I like that I like that so I
just had to pick this up the second I
saw nikkietutorials talking about this
in her favorites video I was like sold
I'm buying it this is the amazing
cosmetics illuminate primer highlighter
and this is in the shade glow she talked
about how this was her favorite primer
that made her look really radiant but
still kept her oils at bay all day so
I'm not very oily but I like it to look
what I did
okay so on-camera like on my viewfinder
my face looks really glowy or when I
look up close it is very shimmery it
doesn't it's not hydrating I mean it
doesn't claim to be a hydrating primer
it really is just gonna give you like a
sheen to the skin in person it's just
very tiny glitter particles like all
over your face which I don't mind as
long as it doesn't look shimmery through
my foundation but from far away I mean
my face looks very glowy but yeah it
feels like there's nothing on my skin
like nothing so this might be amazing
for you if you're oily but you still
want to look glowy but anyway the third
product I'm gonna apply to my face
before I go in with foundation is also
from amazing cosmetics I heard Dana
speak about this Dana Anne here on
YouTube this is the line smoother and
primer I got so excited when she was
talking about this with your yearly
favorites because if you guys saw my
recent haul I have been struggling with
my smile lines it's like all my
foundations love to sink right in there
and she says that she uses this and that
it really helps the foundation from
sinking into the lines and I was like
what
I bought that immediately
I don't know if I'm applying too much
and then she just tops it in looks that
looks pretty good
let's see how foundation looks on top
okay so for foundation this is really
difficult because I felt like every
foundation everyone was talking about I
had already tried except this one and I
was very shocked at how many people had
this in their yearly favourites already
because this just recently came out so
when I saw a few people talk about this
I was like whoa that must be good but
the person who sold me on this was Manny
he was saying how good it was how much
he loved it so I am going to use it this
is the shade Punjab I'm not exactly sure
if this is my shade I can never find my
shade in Norris foundations they all
tend to pull really really yellow oh my
god that I even tell you what this is
called this is the new NARS natural
radiant long wear foundation it says to
shake Wells there don't it's a little a
little deep for me but we'll make it
work
this looks really pretty yeah I just
started putting on and it looks really
pretty
every time I'm filming a talking
tutorial the part where I'm sitting here
just like balancing the foundation on my
face I'm just like sitting here in
silence and I always feel so strange
don't even try using my right hand it
just doesn't even work and I can't fight
this feeling anymore
I forgot it what a stud fighting full
okay so now that this foundation is
completely on my face I freaking love it
and don't want to get too excited but
this looks really pretty on the skin
like I almost look poreless and
everything looks just so smooth now I
just applied it
so obviously this could look like crap
in two hours I love right now it looks
really really pretty and it feels just
like barely tacky there's a little bit
of something but I wouldn't even
consider this tacky and honestly for my
dry skin I can go without setting this
okay so for concealer this one was
really difficult because I felt like
everyone was talking about the Tarte
shaped tape and an are soft matte
complete concealer great great
concealers but actually saw two people
talk about this this is the YSL all ours
concealer now I didn't like the all ours
foundation but I'm excited to try out
the concealer i saw rachel from
rachhloves talk about this and she was
saying that it looks so beautiful
underneath the eyes she says she uses
the shake two and three I got the shade
three I wanted to shade too but it was
sold out and I have a feeling this is
gonna be too dark for me for underneath
the eyes but we shall see
go like one shade lighter than this for
underneath the eyes because I do like a
bright under eye look but we will
brighten it up with some powder
well this blends so easily it's like
boom boom boom and it's done blend it
okay that is the concealer blends it in
okay besides the color I really like how
my under eyes look because I don't know
if you can tell I'm gonna go like this
they kind of look a little dewy but they
don't feel too sticky or tacky I'm sure
it's not crease proof because I can see
a little bit of creasing on my eyes
right now but it's not creasing so bad
though I am definitely gonna pick up a
lighter shade because I am very
intrigued by this concealer and if it
lasts a long time I mean it is the all
hours that lasts a good amount of time
that could be a new favorite who knows I
was in between two powders today I
wanted to try out the Patrick Starr
powder that he recently came out with
with Mac I really wanted to try out that
powder not only because I love Patrick
Starr but because Nicole Guerrero spoke
about it in her yearly favorites and it
was like the only thing I hadn't tried
in her video but I'm gonna save that for
another video and I'm gonna use this
powder instead because my friend Chrissy
from raw Beauty Christy she spoke about
this in her yearly favourites and I had
been excited to try this out anyway so I
picked this one because it's like the
only drugstore product in today's video
except for the eye liner and the lip
liner so I really wanted to switch it up
with a drugstore powder this just
recently came out as well I've actually
heard a lot of people talk about this
powder saying it's so amazing so I am
I'm really really excited to try it I
got mine in the shape fair I also picked
up fair light but I figured since I want
to brighten up my under eyes I'm gonna
go with fair for this video I love the
fit me line they used to have a powder
do you remember I used to talk about it
was at 135 creamy natural they don't
make that anymore and I used to love
that pressed powder I'm gonna grab this
NYX brush and dip it
I'm just gonna kind of bake with it and
then I'm just gonna immediately sweep
that away I just got this brush in my
eye
this one they should make me look pretty
poreless as it is but I feel like this
powder also smooths out my skin really
nicely and every time I apply a heavy
amount of powder like I just did it
underneath my eyes you can see it
sitting on my under eyes and I feel like
you cannot see this powder sitting on my
skin at all well I really like this
powder like no joke so you just get into
a crap out of me that's why your thing
on with Nivea the model okay so so far
so good I feel like my base looks really
really nice okay so you know drill gonna
move on to the eye makeup before I
finish up the face I have a couple
things I want to use on my eyes so let
me get started this video is going to be
it's so long the main one being this bad
boy this is the sassy Sienna's palette
from dose of colors this one is a little
bit of a cheat because even though I
haven't used this palette at all yet the
baked Browns palette is one of my
favorite palettes in the entire world
and they have one called marvelous moths
that I've also used in tutorials that I
love and then when I saw this that they
came out with sassy siennas look at this
color selection it this is great
Kathleen I don't know what does this is
right up my eye I love this colour
selection and I heard Katy luster luxe
talked about this she was saying it's
really good and how much she loves it so
I had to give it a try because I love
Katy some of my favorite youtubers I
feel like if I talk you through this
part of the video it's gonna be crazy
long so I'm just gonna point and you
know while a little music and we'll do
it that way
okay so I am gonna add a little bit of
something else I wasn't going to but I
really want to I heard I see button I
know she's not called se button on you
two anymore s day here on YouTube I've
been watching her since she was sitting
in her dorm room
isn't that crazy but she spoke about
this in her yearly favorites video this
is the Charlotte Tilbury eyes -
mesmerized long-lasting easy color and
this in the shade bet that's one of
those like creamy pots I have one of
these in Cleopatra and I really really
like it but I really wanted to try this
one out because she says that basically
throughout the entire year she went just
like blendness on her entire lid and be
out the door so I really just want to
try this on my lid I'm not gonna take it
all the way across my lid I'm just gonna
focus this mainly on the center and
dragging it towards my inner corners
okay so I'm gonna add more eyeshadows
from a different palette I'm gonna use
the Maybelline city mini palette that
they did in collaboration with makeup by
Shayla I've actually been wanting this
for a while and never got around to
picking it up and then I heard Casey
Holmes talk about it in her video and I
love Casey and I was like you know what
I'm gonna buy that because I've always
wanted it I really want to use this gold
on my lid and I'll probably use this as
my brow bone and maybe I'll use a little
bit of the black just really really
close to my lashes and see how that
looks and then I'll finish up my under
eyes with this guy so let's do that
okay so Casey Holmes also spoke about
the Lonnie London am to PM Co eyeliner
pencil in her video so I decided I
really wanted to try it out because it
was the only eyeliner but somebody spoke
about in their favorites video that I
hadn't tried and I'm pretty sure her
favorite was the black one but I decided
to pick up mocha which is the brown one
so I don't know if this one is good
we're just gonna try it out
ooh I really like that that went on so
so creamy like like butter now I'm gonna
pop on some mascara and I'm really
excited to try out this mascara because
I heard Alana Davison talk about this in
her favorites video and she said that it
was like her favorite mascara ever by
the way my computer loves to turn on and
off by itself she was even saying that
it was like the best Lancome mascara she
had ever used she didn't think anything
was gonna top it this is the Lancome
monster big once here big mascara grande
volume mascara it says big volume all
day we're so excited
okay guys so my eyes are completely done
what do you guys think first of all I
just want to say this mascara is freakin
amazing I think it made my lashes so
thick and voluminous it's like insane
this glittery gold shade in the Shayla
palette is stunning on top of eyeshadow
like it looks so pretty I love the way
the dose of colors shadows blend I mean
I I love this look I just applied a
little bit of contour to my cheeks
because the bronzer is I'm using our
shimmery they're not matte so I just
wanted a little bit of contour on I'm
gonna be trying out too in this video
fun recommended by J kissa and her
yearly favorites and the other one
recommended by Jamie Paige beauty and
her yearly favorites as well and Tina
also spoke about this color in her video
as well yes they are the exact same runs
are only they're two different colors
it's so weird because I've had these
bronzers sitting in my collection for
weeks now and I never tried them out so
I'm gonna start off with Bali Sands this
is the one Jake acai uses she is very
very fair and I'm pretty for myself so I
feel like this one might work for me as
well I love shimmery bronzers I love
bronzers that give you a glow so I don't
know why I my gosh my camera's dying I
don't know why I've never tried this so
I'm just going to pop some on the cheeks
it might be a little too fair for me
right now but I'm sure on my natural
skin color
it'll be fine by the way this is a Sonia
Kashuk blush brush I'm sure when I'm a
little bit more fair this one it's gonna
work for me so I'm just gonna put that
off to the side for now and I'm gonna
try out Capri coast it's just a little
bit warmer and a little bit deeper I
really like that it kind of glows I mean
obviously it's a shimmery bronzer it's
like a glowy bronzer but it's not
glittery some of these shimmery bronzers
can be a little glittery this one's not
this is like the perfect summer
sunkissed lit-from-within kind of Roger
because as you can see I'm like applying
a lot and it's not coming off too
pigmented Haziq so it has a very nice
soft application which I really really
like okay so for blush I've heard so
many people talk about the new makeup
forever what are these called artists
face colors and they did send me quite a
few of them but like I said that was
another product that I just had in my
collection
I hadn't tried out they weren't really
calling my name or my attention you know
I've been stuck on toasted cinnamon but
I heard my friend mrs. Lowell in talk
about this specific color and hearing
your lis favorites it was the bee 302
powder blush and then I also heard raw
Beauty Christie talked about the b11
zero so I bought this little empty one
that you can put two in and I got these
two shades this is the one that my
friend Laura recommended mrs. Lola Lynn
and then this is Christie's favorite so
I think I'm gonna do a little bit of a
mixer room because they're both sunny so
I really like the texture of that blush
I had a little bit of a sheen to it but
it wasn't glittery you guys know how I
feel about glitter it just looks really
natural and really pretty on the skin
not too powdery at all so yes okay so
for highlight honestly I went on a
mission looking through all of my
favorite youtubers yearly favorites
videos and I have tried every single
highlight everyone has talked about
except this one my friend Rose was
talking about this Rosita beauty by
Rosita she spoke about this Mirabella
highlight this is the brilliant mineral
highlighting powder in the shade
swirling pearl so she was saying it's
just a very natural and pretty pearly
iridescent on the face so I'm going to
use my equal tools controlled setting
brush it's my favorite highlighting
brush of all time
this color is very pretty but it's not
my favorite I feel like it doesn't look
as smooth on my skin as I would like it
to look I'm sure this would look really
nice if you use it wet though that must
take this to a whole nother level I
don't know because it's not my absolute
favorite you know what I'm gonna try it
out wet and I literally don't know where
my highlighting brush is I just had it
in my hand okay see I lose things out of
nowhere era I'm gonna spray my Linda
Hallberg brush and I'm just gonna pop
this right at the top of my cheekbones
oh yeah okay so it's definitely much
more intense it has that kind of formula
that works wet or dry so I really like
that
but I love your Rose don't be mad I know
it's your favorite but on my skin it
just doesn't look the best I love
setting down my highlight it just makes
it melt right into the skin all right so
the only thing we have left is the lip
product actually have three to try out
so I'm really excited about this
I was watching Emily Noelle's favorites
videos the Emily awards are like my
favorite things to watch every single
year and I relate to her so much because
she's like a drugstore Queen like me I
feel like she's the drugstore Queen I'm
like a drugstore princess and she's like
the queen I feel like she has that love
for drugstore makeup the way I do like
this not just like pretend like we love
drugstore makeup so she's in a whole lip
category in her video and when she spoke
about lip liners this was the only lip
liner she spoke about more like these
lip liners these are the NYX slide on
glide on lip liners and now I've tried
these in the past I used to have them
like back in the day when I was looking
to my collection they were like nowhere
to be found I don't even remember using
these I know I have I just don't
remember and she said that her favorite
was nude suede shoes which is the one
I'm gonna use today
so I'm not gonna fill them in all the
way I'm gonna leave a little space in
the middle for another lip color but
these are super creamy that was like so
easy to apply you really know your stuff
Emily you really know your stuff I also
really wanted to try out this product
from Newt Styx I've tried a few of the
new six sticks and I really like a lot
of them but I have never tried this one
this one is in the shade whisper which
my friend Jamie Jamie Paige Beauty she
spoke about this one in her favorites
video and I was like ooh I never tried
that one before and I just want to fill
in my lips with this I love it already
already this is such a pretty color this
is my kinda nude that is beautiful I
like that a lot okay and lastly for lips
I heard Tati Westbrook talked about
these
I mean if I've heard a few people talk
about these but Tati was the one who
really sold it to me in her yearly
favorites she talked about it was like
one of the best formulas these are the
YSL liquid lipsticks no no no no the
Couture matte stains they're like liquid
lipsticks but they're more of a stain
she said that they last all day that the
formula is really comfortable I was just
so intrigued by that she really likes
the more bold colors but I really wanted
to try this one out this is in the shade
number 7 I know it's a nude but I really
wanted to give this a go I'm probably
not gonna tell the difference on top of
this freaking lip combo I already have
on but I really trust Tottie's
recommendations as well wow this
applicator is actually really easy to
use it has like this weird like flat
bendy thing you can get right up in
there perfectly
Wow people should really look into this
lip applicator the only thing the only
thing I really don't like about why I
sell are the sense why does everything
smell like that the scent isn't too bad
though and I already feel like I'm I
can't smell it anymore
I'm really gonna give this a go on its
own probably tomorrow I'll probably wear
it throughout the day and see how I like
it but so far so good I love the
applicator on that yeah guys I guess
that's it I loved trying out everybody's
favorites I wanted to try out the
highlighter that Alyssa Ashley mentioned
in her favorites video I took a
screenshot of it it's the laura geller
baked gelato swirl illuminator in
diamond dust it looked so beautiful on
her in her video and I really wanted to
buy it so I did but it hasn't gotten
here yet but I am still really really
excited to try out that highlighter cuz
it looked so nice on her but anyway this
was so much fun I feel like I've
discovered some really good stuff and I
feel like I'm gonna be using a lot of
these a lot so yeah guys that completes
this video thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I'll see you in my next
video bye so I accumulated today what I
guess that's it
Oh mystic eye teeth because I really
because oh holy moly mm-hmm
this brush picks up too much product why
does it sound like the world is ending
outside do you hear that please let that
be a very large airplane I got in here
yet and I really I'm getting my stick
all over my teeth what's happening
it because I feel like I've heard it
