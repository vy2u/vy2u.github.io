a waterproof makeup tested video my
voice is so like in the process of being
lost I mean I don't know what's
happening but I don't feel sick or
anything like that
so I don't know why my voice is doing
this like I really don't know but
so today Emilia and I are going to go to
my mom's house again the pool she's
actually here in the room Emilia yo hi
guys and we're gonna go to my mom's
house to get in the pool and I thought
oh my god is the perfect time to film
this video I've been wanting to do this
video for students a long time since
like last summer I've been telling you
that I wanted to do a full face of
waterproof makeup and I wanted to test
it out to see if it was really
waterproof I want to jump in the pool we
are really going to test how long her
proof this makeup really is I was
looking around my makeup collection for
all the things that were labeled
waterproof and I don't know I did my
best I did my best
the only thing I don't really have
that's waterproof is an eyebrow pencil
so I just put on the Anastasia brow Wiz
in soft brown and then I'm going to take
the clear brow gel also from Anna Sophia
and I'm going to run this through my
brows because on the website on Sephora
it says this is a very long wearing brow
product which it is I love this brow gel
but I don't think it's necessarily
waterproof I also don't have a
waterproof primer so I'm going to take
the ordinary high adherence silicone
primer I've never tried to stop before
so it's probably stupid to try it out in
this video
but I don't have a lot of refinement and
this says it's high adherence so maybe
it'll grab on to the foundation who
knows let's see what is the smell good
you're my name something was smelly so I
would smell like like rub it in your
hand are you stuffing oh man I chipped
my nail this is a person I don't face
all over food I don't get a good girl I
think it smells good I mean it's not
like that okay okay so for foundation
I'm going to be mixing two different
foundations they're both waterproof this
is going to work this is the Rimmel
lasting finish 25 hour we're full
coverage
Jen and it says full coverage foundation
enriched with comfort serum instant
perfect coverage that lasts all day
sweats
heat humidity and transfer proof which
sweat proof is kind of like waterproof
right and then this is the Urban Decay
all nighter waterproof long wear
foundation you guys already know I love
this foundation when I have that
horrible skin irritation that happened
to my face a couple months ago this was
like my go-to I love it
but I'm going to mix a little bit of
this one in because this is too light
for me right now
I have a little bit of a timer you can
tell but I'll do I'm going to put it on
the bug on my hand and then I'm going to
take like few pumps of that and I'm just
going to blend it in with my flower
Beauty sponge I've never tried out this
rimo foundation actually like ever in my
life I was saving it for this kind of
video okay so for concealer I'm going to
be taking the Catrice cosmetics liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer I
love this concealer but I've actually
never tested it like it's waterproof but
I've never tested that I don't really
get oily much so I've never really
noticed I guess it broke up due to sweat
or oil I don't know because I don't
really at least I've never noticed
actually saw casing homes spoke about
this in like a disappointing products
video and I was like a little bit but I
don't think it worked with her oily skin
so I don't know if this really is
waterproof like it claims to be okay so
to set my under eye concealer I'm going
to be using the Catrice prime and fine
time and fine mattifying powder and
transparent and this is a waterproof
setting powder so I'm going to set my
under eyes and my eyes I'm also going to
be putting this powder pretty much like
everywhere kind of to sit down like
foundation even though that foundation
really does not need to be set the Urban
Decay one just in case I'm going to set
everything okay so I'm going to keep it
really simple on the eyes so I'm going
to finish up my face makeup while I'm at
it I'm going to take the Tarte bronzer
in Park Ave princess I don't have the
matte version I only have the shimmery
version and I had no idea this was even
waterproof but when I searched on the
Sephora website for a waterproof bronzer
this one popped up and I already have it
so I'm going to use it I'm digging my
believe about 100 brush and I'm just
going to brown the skin obviously this
isn't going to like contour my face much
because it's vetti t-midi it's like a
warm bronzer with golden shimmers really
pretty for summer little
this bronzer will totally emphasize your
pores though just be weary of that I
usually only use this bronzer I was like
a light dusting on the skin after I
contour but I didn't have any waterproof
mat bronzers so this will do
and then for blush I'm going to take
this water-resistant blush from cargo
cosmetics it's called Los Cabos and I
couldn't find a waterproof blush in my
collection anywhere so I found this one
and it's water-resistant I know it's not
waterproof but it's as good as it's
going to get and this is also a shimmery
product so I'm gonna be very shimmery on
my face have to blend it calm down
alright don't worry about fate I have to
blend it so I also kind of had an issue
with the highlight I didn't have a
waterproof highlight in my collection
there's not many waterproof highlights
on the market I will say but this one
this is the Tarte Amazonian clay
highlighter in exposed this one unless
Sephora website claims to be very long
wearing not that I have anything to do
with being waterproof because just as
something lasts long does it mean it'll
last once water hits it but that's the
one we're going to try out today in the
volta let me just add a little bit exam
already a shimmer princess here
this is also a Linda Hallberg brush this
is the 306
okay so I'm just going to apply the
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray this is also something does it
going to be waterproof but when I
googled it that's what people were
saying so alright let's move on to the
eyes I'm going to keep it really simple
especially since none of my eyeshadow
palettes are waterproof so I'm going to
take the bronzer I use and I'm just
going to run that in my crease I'm also
going to drag that on my lower lash line
now I'm going to take me Marc Jacobs
Highliner Maps Jo eye crayon in the
shade brownie these are waterproof and
these are amazing but I've never tested
them in the water so it's always fun I'm
going to take a pencil brush and just
smudge the eyeliner so it is a little
smoky err
now I'm going to apply some liquid liner
I'm going to take the next epic ink
liner and this is a weatherproof
Fah
okay so I have to pick that I will do
that after all right so I tried to clean
it up my wings don't match and I'm just
animals past it because it's I stress on
that I'm going to blow fuse for mascara
this was a hard one because I despised
waterproof mascara I just don't like how
hard it is to take it off and I know
that it's waterproof so it lasts all day
and it holds a curl but for me it's just
not worth it but I found this in my
collection and I've never even tried
this this is the waterproof version of
the live audience a Chanel it's a Chanel
mascara and it's waterproof but it's
actually a brown color so this is the
only one I was able to find to find this
like brown color and that's what we're
using
okay so this is a mascara I will say
right away I don't like this I have
never tried it before it's just been
sitting in my collection closed and it
was so dry like it applied so dry I mean
it looks nice on the eyes but it was
very very very dry like a dress for Mila
ever so let's see if it doesn't smudge
you know if it stays
okay so we're pretty much done now for a
lift I'm going to go in with my Makeup
Forever aqua lip lip liner this is a
waterproof lip liner and I'm going to
take the shade at 170 and I'm just gonna
leave it like this filled in because I
don't have a lipstick or a liquid
lipstick that claims to be waterproof so
this will be the test and yeah
let's go sit down okay so we are on our
way to my mom's house I probably
mentioned this to you in the video but
the rest of this video is going to be
kind of like blog style because I didn't
want to take my Canon to my mom's house
so I'm filming the rest of the video on
my Sony which I still don't know how to
take this filter off
yes
but anyway we'll still be able to check
how this makeup looks once I dive in the
water and stuff and I'm also going to be
we're also going to film with our GoPro
which this doesn't have a face filter so
that consists man I'm a little nervous
because the site is black
I don't know you could tell it was about
that.we I just know it this way over
here is our gravy bunny worst case
scenario I will just stand in the rain
and we consistently oh by the way I took
off my orange lip because I ate
something and it was like oily in my
kitchen it didn't want the oil to mess
with the lip liner so I took it off and
I'll just apply it again on again some
compounds are clearly set to my mom's
house sky is like like but we are going
to test this out right now I just put my
lip back on is doing okay okay let's
test this makeup
I think tell me any duties okay well the
lipliner is awesome and the eyeliner the
liquid liners like pretty in flux is
just a little bit let me see
the mascara is on there but it is
running under running a little bit no
actually I think that's the what did you
put eyeliner I know it's running mark
take a point yeah for real I'm sure I
mean I smudged it down
although Moki okay they're not quite in
the room at that part is just okay so
the most scares the only thing that I
see that it's kind of like it just like
a beginner
how does my bronzer bronzer looks it
looks perfect let me just see the
foundation oh yeah how's the foundation
yeah the foundation is cakey hurry up
cakey yeah it's quicker on the nose now
the highlight feel like and wash away I
mean it wasn't waterproof it's not that
yeah no it's not there yeah I'm going to
try to go under a bunch of tiny piece
it's already coming off I mean on the
inside yes I'll enter still the same it
just man against God yeah this chlorine
is burning my eyes hey Darce
oh my guys this order sister Dorothy
okay it's actually not so bad it is
cakey for sure around the nose I t-zone
is where the season here right around
the bronze area soon just move pretty
good looks pretty good my nose area
always dis cakey and disgusting with
foundation so that's probably why that
happened on my nose if I were to use
more of the urban decay foundation I
wouldn't have really done that because
that's like one of my Holy Grail
foundations I love it
I am surprised at how much it's rubbed
off like I am really surprised at how
much it rubs off because those things
last on my lips for a long time like I'm
wearing that all night I'm really really
impressed with this NYX eye liner and it
stayed intact there well that looks
pretty good this mascara it's not bad
because I don't like it when mascaras
like smudge like if it's a waterproof
mascara and you have black all over the
bottom of your eye that is pointless
this one's in a new ball so let's melt
out I mean it clumps together but that's
because I'm I went underwater and this
eyeliner this Marc Jacobs one on my
waterline is waterproof because I went
under and I still see it like right
there on my waterline I'm pretty
impressed
I think the bronzer stayed on I can't
really see the highlights that much but
actually yeah I see it a little bit
everything else I touched it all day
it's pretty good right no yeah no yeah
just a lip in the nose area network
creamy totally approve this okay guys so

version of waterproof makeup test didn't
