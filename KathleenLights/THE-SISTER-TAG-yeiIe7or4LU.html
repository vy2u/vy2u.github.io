sorry that the light is so yellow but
we're at our mom's house right now so
like this is the only lighting I could
have right now since you know my whole
room situation so it's a little yellow
but yeah we don't argue anymore we used
to hate each other
yeah because of the age difference she
was my annoying little sister when I

middle school I guess yeah no elementary
school number seven what's the best
thing about one another shot didn't
matter okay what's the best thing about

well lately with Sophia because my
daughter's three going on 27 yeah so I
tend to lose my patience with her but oh
yeah definitely her personality her
sense of humor like I said she's the
funniest person on the face of the
planet and she is the only person aside
from my husband that I can be completely
100% my true self around yeah like if
people read the conversations we had
over iMessage like people with it would
be
Mircea like we're very open favorite
inside joke there's a fish that's just
okay but this is stupid because inside
jokes I don't be funny with many people
on the inside but at one time telling
the story because I'd already remember
that well I don't even know if I was
there um one time um we were sitting
around the living room and her dad my
brother our brother and I were just
talking randomly and there was a fish
tank behind us that was really dirty
full of algae I think they hadn't been
cleaned in years
yeah like there were no pictures there
were no fish in it and then we were all
just engaging in conversation I forgot
what we were talking about but my
brother randomly just busts out with I
hope you know there's a fish in the tank
and we were like what where did that
come from and I was like I like pizza
yeah like it's not funny to them yeah
but now every time something is really
really random sister know I'll be like
okay there's a fish in the tank favorite
