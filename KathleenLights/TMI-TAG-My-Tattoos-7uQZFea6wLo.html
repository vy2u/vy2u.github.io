because it was raining all day and I say
that as it suddenly gets gloomy in my
room but anyway it was raining all day
and I was like I cannot film today
because there's absolutely no Sun it's
been raining super gloomy not gonna film
and then I looked at the weather on my
phone and it said it was going to be
raining all week and raining a lot and
then I thought man I'm probably not
gonna be able to film tomorrow or the
next day and since I was not prepared to
film a beauty video today I figured what
better video to film then they TMI tag
so that is what this video is going to
be today did it need that long
introduction absolutely not but by the
way you couldn't already tell I'm
feeling a little Danny sick today
Danny's sake is like home sick I'm kind
of feeling homesick too but yeah I'm
feeling Danny sick today so I busted out
my favorite picture of us and I put it
right here even though it does not match
with my furniture actually the glare of
the fan is driving me crazy on that
frame right now like that's all I keep
looking at and the window is like
reflecting off my glasses let's just
let's just take this off and let's just
let's just put this down then
number one is what are you wearing I'm
wearing my jogging clothes actually I'm
going to go jogging later and I'm
literally in like sweats and a sports
bra and this ensemble ever been in love
yep I'm also in love with this little
fellow right here ever had a terrible
breakup no not really how tall are you
well I like to think I'm 5 2 well at
least that's what my driver's license
says how much do you weigh any tattoos
yes I have 7 tattoos so the first tattoo
I ever got was the star on my foot I got
it when I was 16 years old and honestly
there is no meaning behind this tattoo I
just got it because my sister had the
exact same one and I was like The
Annoying copycatting little sister and I
got myself a tattoo and then my best
friend got the same one and it's just
like a circle of beautiful stars on
everyone's feet and by the way I am
covering my feet in these clips because
I know some people have like toe issues
and they don't like to see toes so I'm
just trying to not to have like scary
looking toes but toes are just weird
right I don't want to show my toes
that's weird the second tattoo I got was
this hideous disgusting thing on my
wrist it's supposed to be a key like a
heart key I got this when I was 17 it's
supposed to be like a heart key and it
does not look like a heart heat the guy
completely messed it up he had to do it
over like four times like it was a hot
mess really the guy had no idea what he
was doing and what he put on my wrist
was not the picture I gave him not even
the least bit and I will be covering
this tattoo with something else in the
future in the near future hopefully
because I can't even look at it uh drive
me nuts the heart on my pinky was Miley
Cyrus inspired I had like a phase where
absolutely loved Miley Cyrus and
everything about her before she went
absolutely nuts
um I'm not a big fan of Miley Cyrus at
all anymore but I used to be and I just
loved her heart tattoo on her pinky and
I basically got the same one
Danni helped me pick out the music note
behind my ear because it was either
between this or a feather and I just
wanted I really love music and I just
really loved the feather there was a
meaning behind it I just really really
liked it so Danni liked the music note
more so I was like yeah and I just went
with the music note that the two I have
right here is pretty self-explanatory I
mean it's a cross and I believe in God
so that's that um this one on my back is
the infinity sign and me and Danni
actually got the exact same tattoo only
his is a lot bigger and we just wanted
to get a tattoo that symbolized our
relationship so we got the infinite sign
and then the one on the side of my foot
is a John Mayer quote from the song
gravity and it says keep me where the
light is this tattoo is actually in my
handwriting it is a little bit sloppy
and a little bit weird but I like it
that way because it is in my exact
handwriting and even if it was a little
crooked and stuff I made him do it
exactly the way that I wrote it I have
been obsessed with this quote since I
heard the song gravity for the first
time and that quote just stood out to me
like no other I can't even stay here and
talk about all the things that keep me
where the light is just means to me but
it is a very special tattoo for me any
piercings yep I got my ears pierced and
I've got my belly button pierced what is
your OTP OTP stands for one true pairing
what's your favorite fictional couple
okay so I'm going to go ahead and cheat
and say that I'm allowed to have more
than one one true pairing I'm going to
go ahead and start off with Stefan and
Elena I am team Selena 100
I am NOT team Damon and Elena and I
don't care what anybody tells me Stefan
is her one true love just go ahead and
watch season one one more time and just
just go do that just go do that also
Jack and Emily I mean they need to wake
up and smell the coffee because it
hasn't happened yet and got I have I
don't know why I also haven't seen the
last few episodes since Danny and I
watch that show together and I'm not
allowed to watch it without Danny so if
it has happened please don't tell me
Oliver Felicity I am so tea Melissa tea
even though it has not happened yet
I am hoping hoping that it does ask for
Caffrey on my favorite couple in a
comedy and that is Danny and Mindy they
need to be together they're just
destined of course after Ross and Rachel
but that's just that's without saying
Ross and Rachel I'm econ but I've got to
say the two on-screen couples that are
my absolute favorite that I feel like it
doesn't get better than them they are
the freakin best they are the one
preparing both of these and that is Jim
and Pam from the office hands down best
couple out there they are perfect and
then the couple that really pulls at my
heart strings and that is Sarah and
Michael Scofield from Prison Break and I
know that Prison Break is like a show
that ended a long time ago already but
they get emotional just talking about
Michael Scofield and Sarah perfection
purr fection okay so I think that's
enough with the otps I bet I mean I can
go on forever I watched a lot of TV
favorite show my hair show hands down
has always been friends but aside from
comedy I think that my favorite show
right now has to be arrow it's is good
favorite bands my favorite band
I love Jack's Mannequin more than
anything in the world like Jack's
Mannequin is my life they are the best
if you don't know who they are
YouTube their songs and you will not
regret it
they're amazing specifically the song we
were made for each other
go go go youtube it right now go
something you miss something right not
someone something I miss fund it because
I can't find it anywhere it's my
favorite candy did they like
discontinued fun dip what's that about
favorite song my favorite song is boys
of summer by Don Henley that has always
been my favorite song forever and ever
never yeah where's our summer I done
Henley how old are you I am 22 guides I
get comments on a daily basis telling me
that I look 15 and honestly it doesn't
bother me and I take it as a compliment
but it's like on a daily basis like oh
my god you look 12 why are you putting
on makeup if you're like 13 guys in 22 I
promise zodiac sign I am an Aquarius
although I am nothing absolutely nothing
like my sign quality you look for in a
partner I mean besides the obvious that
I could never date somebody who's like I
just need like someone funny I need that
comedy in my life and Danny makes me
laugh like nobody does it's he's
hilarious to me but besides that I
cannot deal with men who aren't manly I
know that sounds kind of messed up but I
like the rugged rough hands I don't care
protector warrior type of man like her
kind of guy like I'm very I need that in
my life because I'm such a pansy and I'm
such a chicken for everything that I
need to be with someone who's like
seriously a warrior that's the only way
I could explain it that sounds like
super Pocahontas or like some Mulan type
stuff but that is a major quality I look
for a guy who's not
Hansy basically as blunt and mean as it
sounds just a manly man favorite quote
you could probably guess it it is keep
me where the light is it is a quote from
John Mayer's song gravity favorite actor
my favorite actor of all time is Gary
Sinise if I could meet any famous person
and history of the world
it's Gary Sinise he's Lieutenant Dan in
Forrest Gump if you guys don't know who
I'm talking about he's also in CSI New
York which is my favorite CSI out of all
the csi's cuz he's in it but I love him
he's a great actor and he also seems
like a pretty stand-up guy he is a big
supporter of our troops and he's just
fantastic but I just want to meet him
but besides him I really really love
Kevin Bacon a lot too favorite color my
favorite color of all time is red but I
also really like the color peach how
long does it take you to get ready in
the morning well it depends where I'm
going if I'm just going to like Target I
will slap on literally the first thing I
see for my hand a bun and walk out the
door like I have no shame walking out
like a complete mess when it comes to
like Walmart Target the grocery store I
just don't care but if it's somewhere
where I actually have to get dressed and
do my makeup and stuff like that then
yeah I gotta say I take a pretty long
time ever been in a physical fight no
what are your turn ons nice manly hands
that's a major turn-on um nice teeth I
like my teeth cologne when Danny wears
this cologne I'm like ah smell delicious
turn offs
I really hate like overly cocky arrogant
men like oh my ego is bigger than me and
a tool and momma's boys' no me no likey
Mama's voice me no likey the reason I
joined YouTube I have been obsessed with
watching YouTube videos since high
school like that's all I did and I would
watch them so much that I got to a point
where Danny was like why don't you do
this like why why don't you make videos
I mean you're on YouTube 90 percent of
your day might as well and I did fears
oblivion just kidding
that was a Fault in Our Stars reference
if you got that reference you're my best
friend and if you've never read The
Fault in Our Stars
then this didn't make any sense to you
I'm not gonna list all my fears because
I would be here till the end of the
century because I got a lot of figures
gas stations and the Vader's planes cars
people last thing that made you cry I'm
a crier guys I cry all the time
any just hint and emotional anything on
any show any movie and it's just like
waterworks I'm always crying last time
you said you loved someone right now
actually when I was texting Danny
meaning behind your youtube name while
my youtube name has like a double
meaning for as long as I can remember I
have been obsessed with lights like
author middle school in high school like
I have just been fascinated with lights
I don't know and it just so happens that
my all-time favorite mac eye shadow in
history over the world is called amber
lights and I thought okay I will just
switch the amber and put Kathleen and
there you go Kathleen lights has nothing
to do with me liking lights but it all
ties together I don't know I just I
don't know what just happened like that
last book you read the last book I read
is The Fault in Our Stars it was awesome
the book you're currently reading I'm
not currently reading a book but I want
to start divergent my friend lend to me
and I need to start it because the movie
was so good that I really want to read
the books last show you watched
I was watching Melissa and Joey all of
last night so that's the last show I
watched favorite food oh this
another one I can go on forever I love
food but my favorite food of all time is
Mexican food
I could eat Mexican food every single
day but very very close in second would
be Honduran food like food from a ludus
oh my god delicious like amazing
definitely Mexican and Honduran food are
my favourite place you want to visit the
number-one place I want to visit that
I've always wanted to visit my whole
life is Paris last place you were the
last place I was I haven't traveled in a
long time but the last place I was was
Disney World I went with Danny like four
years ago
no like three years ago yeah so I was
like a while ago I haven't been we
haven't traveled in a long time last
time you kissed someone um the beginning
of January I haven't kissed Danny since
January and it's a little depressing
last time you were insulted
honestly I don't get insulted easily I
get annoyed easily when people are mean
it annoys me but I don't get insulted I
just feel like people who try to insult
you are just sad individuals and have
nothing better to do with their lives so
just don't feel insulted if somebody has
something bad to say about you who cares
so I don't really get insulted that
easily unless Danny tells me something
insulting Mike I don't like it lipstick
and I'm like that's rude and that
insults me favorite flavor of sweet I
love absolutely anything cherry flavored
yet I hate cherries which is weird but I
love cherry flavored things what
instruments do you play
none I have no talent favorite piece of
jewelry my favorite piece of jewelry has
to be my wedding ring and it symbolizes
everything that's important to me so of
course my favorite piece of jewelry is
my ring I still haven't gotten my
wedding band though I know this is like
the engagement ring but I still haven't
gotten my wedding band yet we're working
on that last sport you played sport last
song you sang Weiss off frozen last
night for like the first time ever will
