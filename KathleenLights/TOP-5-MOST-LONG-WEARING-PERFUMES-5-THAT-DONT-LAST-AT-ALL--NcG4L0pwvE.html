something I asked you guys on Twitter if
you wanted to see and a bunch of you
guys said yes I made a poll asking you
guys if you wanted to see my most long
wearing perfumes that I have in my
collection like the ones that last
forever on my skin the ones that make it
through anything and then I told you
guys I also wanted to include my bottom
5 D perfumes that don't last on my skin
at all we're kind of doing a top 5 and
bottom 5 when it comes to how long a
perfume lasts because there are a lot of
perfumes in my collection that I love so
much just because I love the scent but
they just don't last on my skin so it
doesn't mean I don't like that perfume
it just means it just doesn't last on me
so that's what we're talking about today
longevity not really the cents
I mean I'm gonna go over notes and
everything but it's mainly about that so
I'm really excited for today's video I
know that there are some people who just
don't like perfume videos because you
can't smell them here with me so
sometimes it does feel a little bit
pointless but I'm gonna have the notes
here written on the screen and I'm gonna
try to be as detailed as I possibly can
we're gonna discuss the perfumes that
literally last forever on my skin you
guys know I am a perfume collector I
know that sounds horrible because
perfumes eventually go bad but I'm
obsessed with perfumes I have so many
different perfumes I've tried so many
different scents and out of all the ones
I own these are the ones that just last
the longest on my skin which makes me
always go back to them I'm always
constantly using these five perfumes
because they just last forever there
really is no point in wearing a perfume
if it doesn't last on you and I hang on
to a bunch of perfume that doesn't last
on me just because I love the scent but
it's so frustrating then you have to
carry a travel-size in your purse at all
times even though I already do that it's
kind of annoying but I'm gonna go ahead
and jump into these and I'm not gonna go
in any specific order and before I get
started sorry longest intro ever but
before I get started I do want to
mention everybody's skin is totally
different and certain perfumes that last
forever on me might not last long on you
I know it seems weird but sometimes I'll
smell someone and ask them what they're
wearing and when they tell me I'm like
oh my gosh I've tried that perfume in it
does not last on me like how do I still
smell you it's just crazy everyone's so
different but these are the ones that
really really work for me and I feel
like they might work for you too but I
don't know
that put all that in this flame for just
in case so this is the cheapest one out
of all of them this is aqua Lena pink
sugar and I've spoken about pink sugar
100 times on my channel
none of these perfumes you've never seen
before except maybe one of them but this
is so affordable in terms of perfume I
think the biggest bottle is like $60
which for a lot of brands that's usually
the price of their smallest bottle so I
really appreciate the price on this guy
and while this lasts forever on my skin
I'm gonna repeat myself a lot in this
video I just know it this is a sweet
lover's dream if you're into very sweet
scents I say run and try this bad boy
out it is so good it was my go-to for a
while it's so insane how perfumes will
literally transport you in time
I honestly think that's my favorite
thing about perfumes all of these
perfumes just remind me of something
different in my life I find that so nice
they're like little memories in a bottle
I freaking love four fumes but anyway
every single time I wear this somebody
compliments me without fail they're
always like oh my gosh you smell like
cookies or oh my gosh I just want to eat
you you smell so sweet you smell so
yummy it's always like you smell
delicious
I want to dip you in some milk and eat
you a little bit the notes are very
sweet and fruity it has cotton candy
vanilla it has a little bit of musk and
even though it is very very very sweet
it doesn't give me a headache and I
don't find it to be too overpowering
that's just me personally I know some
people don't like it and say that it's
too sweet but I like the sweetness of
this if you guys have ever tried product
candy I feel like that one is very very
sweet and even though this one smells
like sweeter it doesn't give me a
headache like Prada ken I don't know and
if I had product candy I would mention
it in my non long-wearing perfumes list
because Prada candy does not last on my
skin at all and it's a bummer because it
does smell good but out of all the
really really sweet scents in my life
this is the one that lasts the longest
on my skin and I think it's freaking
amazing if you're like in high school or
something I think you might really like
this because it's just so like flirty
and girly I love it okay so my next one
I don't want to talk about too long
because I just recently spoke about this
in a favorites video but it is Jimmy
Choo by Jimmy Choo and this is such a
sexy perfume this is another one that
every time I wear it I get loads of
compliments people just tell me all the
time that I
smell amazing every time I wear this one
it's a sweet scent but a very powerful
sweet scent like a an empowering sweet
saying I don't know what it is about it
that every time I put it on I'm like oh
yes I'm ready for the day but it
honestly lasts forever on the skin and
I'll keep smelling it as the day goes on
sometimes scents are very long wearing
but you won't smell it on yourself after
a few hours other people will smell it
but just not you but this is the kind of
perfume I smell all day even on myself
and it's just it's epic this is freaking
epic alright so if right now all of my
perfumes were hanging off the edge of a
building and I could only save one of
them this is the woman I would save this
beautiful darling right here this is my
favorite perfume of all time not saying
a lot because I have a lot of them but
this one is my favorite it's been my
favorite perfume for about 10 years now
wow this is Gucci number two so it's
called - it's called Gucci - and for a
very long time I thought this was
discontinued I couldn't find it anywhere
and a part of me still believes it is
kind of discontinued because the only
place I could find it now is on the
Sephora and this is the only size they
carry now I used to always get the
bigger size the 3.4 fluid ounce but this
is one point six and I'm getting really
nervous about that because I don't know
I mean it's been available on Sephora
for a while now it hasn't been taken
down but I can't find it anywhere else
and that's starting to worry me because
Gucci has done that to me in the past
with Gucci by Gucci I'm not gonna talk
about it in today's video because that
would definitely be top 5 because that
one lasts ages on me as well but it was
discontinued and they took out Gucci
premier like they replaced through a
Gucci premier who which doesn't last as
long and doesn't smell as good so good
job Gucci good job I think out of all
the perfumes that have broken my heart
it's Gucci by Gucci because Danny
actually bought that for me on our first
date like how random but I love that
perfume it's amazing if you could still
find Gucci by Gucci I would get my hands
on it but don't get it confused with
Gucci premier because it's not the same
but anyway I digress this perfume can
literally go for days I will spray this
in the morning and I will smell it like
the next day at night I know it sounds
really weird but for some reason it's my
favorite perfume to wear like in the
pool in a jacuzzi or something like that
well it sounds really
weird but this smells so good in the
water I'm not crazy is there anybody out
there that feels that way about any
perfume in their collection felt like it
just smells really good when you're in
the pool I don't know I'm not so but
whenever I wear this I'll go take a
shower at night at the end of the day
and I'm like washing my body I will
still smell it and it just blows me away
every time it is so so so long wearing
and it smells so amazing if I could
describe this scent it's not really
candy sweet it's like fruity sweet I
think my favorite note in this fragrance
is blackcurrant for some reason every
time a perfume either has black currant
or patchouli in it it like drives me
wild those are my top two like favorite
perfume notes and I find that patchouli
lasts a long time on my skin and so does
blackcurrant I don't know if that's what
I love about this perfume but it's so
good it lasts forever I highly recommend
you checking it out the only thing I
don't like about this is the packaging
like this weighs 26 pounds this is so
heavy I hate traveling with this perfume
I never travel with it it's so freakin
heavy okay so this is gonna be no
surprise to a lot of you because this is
like the most long ring perfume on
literally everybody anytime somebody's
wearing this perfume I could smell it
from like across the room and that is
Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel this one is
a very fancy perfume this is like the
special occasion woman you bring her out
when you want to go to a wedding like a
baby shower a tea party a garden party
I don't know something very very special
this is my special occasion fragrance I
don't like to wear it on a daily basis
because it is that special kind of
perfume the scent is so beautiful I
would say out of all my perfumes like
here today this is the one that's the
most sophisticated and the most fancy
this is another perfume of mine that has
patchouli in it the patchouli I feel
like makes it so musky and elegant and
sensual I don't know it's so freakin
good
it literally lasts days it's such a
beautiful scent that will take you
through the night I love it if you've
been thinking about splurging on this
one I would say go for it because it is
worth the money since it lasts so long
on your skin okay and then the last one
I want to talk about its what kind of
made me want to do this video in the
first place I don't know if I've ever
spoken to you guys about this perfume I
want
say that I have I think I've spoken
about it on Twitter for sure but this
perfume is called chat with the 1881 and
it's from Nino Cerruti
so I don't exactly know how I discovered
this perfume but this was the only
perfume I wore in ninth grade actually
in eighth grade a lot as well I kind of
worked from eighth grade to my sophomore
year but definitely in eighth grade and
in ninth grade I feel like those were
the two years i warn't the most which is
so weird to think about now because I
can't picture myself liking this scent
as a middle schooler or as like a
freshman in high school because it's
such a like grown-up scent I think that
I'm a little bit shocked but this works
so well with my body chemistry I don't
know what it is about this that every
time I wear this people tell me I smell
really good and yummy and just cozy
that's literally the word people use
actually they tell me I smell very very
cozy warm and inviting every time I wear
this scent this scent actually warms up
very nicely like when I first spray this
it's not my favorite right off the bat
it does smell a little bit florally
which I'm not really into florals all
that much but as you where and it starts
to like work with your body that becomes
so delicious and I love it the longer
it's on my skin
honestly this perfume stays on my body
forever I know that the top notes are
like mimosa and I know that there's
chamomile in this scent I don't know if
I smell chamomile but I think I smell
mimosa I really do it does have like
those base notes of sandalwood and
vanilla so it does have a little bit of
something to it you know it's not just
flowers
I love it so much and it's funny because
the other day I put this on and then I
went to go hang out with Amelia and as
soon as I got in her car she was like
why do you smell like middle school she
knew right away that this is the perfume
I used to wear back in the day
that's how unique and different it is
and how much it stays on your skin she
was like whoa that just took me back
which I can agree this I don't know I
think that's why I love it so much this
takes me back to my teenage years like
right back to eighth grade walking those
blue hallways with my weird teal and
yellow earrings good times good times
so those were my top five most long
wearing perfumes and it was really
really hard not to include Viktor and
Rolf Flowerbomb in here or George
our money see those are like my sixth
and seventh place just in case you guys
were wondering I do want to give an
honorable mention in the long way or
category because this is the most long
wearing hair fragrance ever and even
though I'm not talking about hair
fragrance I do want to mention this
because I have six hair perfumes in my
collection and none of them last on my
hair like this one does this is from the
brand takka takka takka I'm not exactly
sure but this is their hair fragrance in
Julieta oh this does things to me guys
this does things to me my hair could be
smelling like buttholes I sprayed a
little bit of this on my hair and
immediately after everyone will be
telling me like wow your hair smells so
good even hours later people will be
like wow your hair smells so good I'll
have this in my hair and then I have a
different perfume on my body but I don't
really find that they clash I feel like
it doesn't overpower the scent on my
body if you're looking for a hair
fragrance that's actually gonna last in
your hair and not just fizzle out after
a couple minutes you need this in your
life okay so now I want to talk about
the bottom five in my collection so I
have a lot of different perfumes i want
to say i have like 225 and there are a
lot of them that are average you know
they don't last forever but they don't
fade after just an hour you know they're
just they're good they're solid these do
not last on me not even an hour it's
kind of like I don't know why I'm
spraying it on my body what is the point
no one ever smells them I'll ask people
like hey do you smell me and they're
like they're really so frustrating and
first only ones like well I'm so sad
about this is these Phil McCartney pop
perfume I've spoken about this in the
past because I love this fragrance so
much it smells so good it literally
smells like Barbie dolls literally I
don't know if it's because I grew up in
the 90s and I grew up with Barbies
that's literally all I ever played with
as a kid I was a Barbie girl but this
smell is identical to Barbie like to her
shoes or clothes I think even her like
skin her face I just smelled a Barbie
when I smell this such a fun scent that
honestly takes me back in time but I
never wear it anymore because there
really is no point honestly I have just
been using this to go to sleep after I'm
done taking a shower I'll just lay this
on my entire
and go to bed because it fades anyway it
just doesn't last on me okay so this one
is a major disappointment because it's a
suspensive this is the Versace fragrance
I think it's called arrows puffin arrows
it smells delicious this smells so sweet
like candy I love it and I love the
bottle because I truly truly do love
this fragrance but it's just one that I
have to throw in my purse every time I
go to wear it because after about two
hours I don't smell any more
I want my perfumes to last all day and
this one just does not okay so my next
one is extremely extremely frustrating
because this is one of my favorite
scents in the world I think it smells so
freakin good but it does not last on me
at all and that is Viva La Juicy by
Juicy Couture this one is like the sugar
one this is Viva La Juicy suka but I'm
just talking about the original people
did you see right now I don't know where
my bottle is actually I think I
misplaced there or I might have given it
away but I love the Viva La Juicy line I
think I have like four of these I have
Viva La Juicy the original noir the gold
one and then I have this one and none of
them last on my skin these fade within
an hour - it is crazy even less than
that just does not do it for me which
totally sucks because I smell this
perfume all the time on my cousin like
when she comes over
I can smell Viva La Juicy on her and I'm
like wow it just does not last on my
skin major bummer
which leads me to the next perfume
because I actually bought this perfume
when I smelled it like immediately when
I smelled it for the first time because
it smells identical to Viva La Juicy and
that is Gucci flora Gucci has a few
different Flora's but I am specifically
talking about the pink one and I don't
know the name of the pink one oh yes
gorgeous gardenia I don't know if I'm
insane guys smell Viva La Juicy and then
smell Gucci flora gorgeous gardenia and
tell me if I'm crazy or not but they
smell very very similar I actually like
flora just a little bit more but what a
major disappointment because this does
not last on me not even a little bit
Amelia actually had the exact same
perfume and when I was telling her
I was like man this crap does not last
on my skin she was like I know it does
not last on me at all so I don't okay
and then the last perfume I want to talk
about is one that smells so so so good
it's actually rated like five stars on
Sephora I think everyone and their
mother loves this fragrance and I am one
of those people as well I love this
fragrance so much but no load up nothing
it does not laugh and that is black
opium by YSL this smells like a sexy
night out like holy crap this smells
amazing I actually have this in a hair
fragrance and in two travel size because
I love this perfume so much that I make
sure I'm constantly spraying my body
like every hour like I keep the travel
size in my purse just to continue to
smell like this because this does not
last on me at all let me know in the
comments below if you have this perfume
and if it lasts on you because even my
mom tells me like man you put on that
black opium perfume and then like an
hour later I don't smell it anymore it
can be so frustrating and this one is
one of my most frustrating perfumes I
hope you enjoyed this video I hope it
was somehow helpful maybe if you're
looking for a really awesome long
wearing perfume you might check out one
of these but I would love to know your
thoughts on all these perfumes in the
