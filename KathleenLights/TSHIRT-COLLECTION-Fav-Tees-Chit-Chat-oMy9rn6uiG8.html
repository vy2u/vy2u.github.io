a little different I'm actually gonna be
sharing with you my favorite t-shirts I
know that that might seem like a weird
video but this was actually requested it
was requested like a couple months back
on a video I never got around to doing
it but I'm doing it now and that common
had a bunch of likes on it so there were
a few people who wanted to see this not
just one here's the thing I really
really love fashion so much but I like
to be comfortable more therefore I live
in t-shirts also I'm a hermit crab and I
don't really even my house much so like
my going-out clothes I don't wear those
as often as I wear like my t-shirts so I
have a lot I have a lot of t-shirts and
these are just my favorite ones I have I
have more okay I'm not gonna lie I have
a lot more I do I also have this thing
but if I love a certain show or if I
love a certain person or a certain band
a certain movie I have to for some
reason have a t-shirt I don't know why
I'm just that kind of person so I
gathered all of my favorite shirts put
them on my bed tried them all along for
you guys and we're gonna talk about them
okay so I think I'm gonna go in
categories yes I have categories let me
organize this for a second oh look
there's a cornelius under this okay so
really quickly before i get started i
just want to mention that i'm not sure
if you're gonna be able to get any of
these t-shirts i'm gonna try to find all
of them and link them below some of them
are really new i know that they're still
on certain websites but some of these
are really old and i don't even know if
you can get them anymore but like I said
this was requested so I thought I would
do it anyway and I'm just tired of the
same old videos you know I just I wanted
to do something I haven't done before so
here we are by the way I'm wearing a
Power Ranger shirt my favorite all right
so I have three piles for you we have
the movie slash TV show pile which
there's only one shirt in here that's
about a movie but I couldn't plan my
Back to the Future t-shirt anywhere so
there's only one in this pile and then
this pile is the musical pile the band
tees and then this is miscellaneous
alright so let's get this show on the
road let me show you my entire wardrobe
because I live in t-shirts literally if
you come to my house on any given day
I'm wearing a t-shirt okay so I know I
got this shirt at Urban Outfitters I
usually get shirts at Urban Outfitters
forever21 or Etsy so this is my Clarissa
explains it all t-shirt when I saw this
I just knew I had to have it I used to
love this show so much when I was
younger I was actually really really
young when this show was on TV but my
sister really liked it and she's seven
years older than me so a lot of the
shows that she would watch I kind of
watched as well and I loved Clarissa
explains it all and I remember watching
I show when I was younger and thinking
oh my god how cool I want my best guy
friend to come in through a window on a
ladder except they don't live in a
two-story house so not on the ladder no
this is the only movie one by the way we
see dog here flying everywhere
Celine sheds this has to be one of my
favorite t-shirts like definitely top
five this shirt says yippie ki-yay
mother and I actually have pencils that
say this I have a little blue pencil on
my desk let's say this this is a super
famous line from the movie die hard
it's an old 80s movie and I know it's
weird but it's one of my favorite movies
I have a few movies that I truly cherish
and love but shock people a little bit
like die hard I can recite the entire
movie pretty much I've seen it that many
times and I also really love Kill Bill
which I don't like gory stuff but I love
Kill Bill both Volume one and two but I
love this movie part two was alright and
I kind of really did like part three but
the rest are garbage
it's like those movies you know when
they don't know how to stop like okay
part 7 part a it's like enough a free
die hard of a good day to die hard it's
so weird
the original is my favorite this year
was actually a present for me by
boxycharm I spoke about Three's Company
and one of my boxycharm unboxing videos
and then they gifted this to me how
sweet is Nate I love this shirt so much
I was a huge Three's Company span when I
was younger I guess because I didn't
have a bedtime growing up which I don't
know why but I never ever did I would go
to bed like a Tuesday in the morning and
like my parents wouldn't even care they
would just leave my TV on and they
always played Three's Company really
late at night so growing up I watched so
much of Three's Company I was a huge
John Ritter fan is just so nostalgic for
me and I love this little shirt so thank
you buck Saturn it's one of my favorites
you guys have probably seen me wear this
a couple of times it's so funny how
every time I wear this t-shirt when I go
out in public
if there's anybody who has no idea what
this means they always ask me like why
do you have on a paper company's t-shirt
people get so confused but this is a
shirt referring to the office one of the
best TV shows of all time
it's definitely top five for me in terms
of comedy friends being the number one
in my heart and then the office is
definitely in second place and then I
truly love new girl which I don't have
any new girl t-shirts
I do have Knick earrings though love
this shirt it's so loud but I mean it's
Dunder Mifflin ha how cute how cute I
love this I know for a fact that if you
go on Etsy and you search Dunder Mifflin
t-shirts like you'll get a ton of
options speaking of the office this is
probably my favorite t-shirt in the
universe
my friend Gaby bought me this she bought
for me for my birthday and she got it
from this website called rage on I
believe I will link it down below but
she said it was the slowest shipping it
was like the biggest mission she
honestly doesn't recommend to anybody
shop on that website but I'm so glad she
did because I love this shirt I mean
come on but I gotta say my favorite
Michael Scott on this shirt though is
prison Mike prison my keys surprisingly
enough I only have four friends t-shirts
I have a couple that are tank tops and a
couple that are like long sleeves this
one is brand new actually I got this one
at Urban Outfitters and it was available
a few months ago but then it's sold out
and I got so excited when it came back I
was dying for just a plain white t-shirt
that had the frends logo on it and it's
finally mine
I love this shirt this one I bought on
Etsy calm and it's just a little simple
gray t-shirt that says Central Perk
which is the coffee shop that all the
friends hang out in so I mean there's
nothing special to this shirt it's just
like the Central Perk logo which kinda
represents Central Perk I mean this one
is also from Urban Outfitters and I
really love this one too because it's
very very cozy it has like a really soft
delicious material and I love that the
picture on the shirt kind of looks faded
and I love this picture of them I
actually have this photo like in a
poster I'm excessive I love this one
it's so soft I have to say this is one
of the t-shirts I wear the most oh this
one I got on Etsy and this just has the
names of all the characters this one is
so soft too by the way
Chandler Joey Phoebe Ross Rachel I would
love to know who's your favorite
friend's character mine hands down this
Chandler I think they all make the show
you know they all play such an important
role but Chandler is my favorite and
then I true I love Ross they're all
great they're all good on the show it's
not like How I Met Your Mother
do you guys watch our show I love how I
Met Your Mother and did not like how it
ended I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone
who's currently watching How I Met Your
Mother but the ending no it's not how I
wanted it that those are not the people
I wanted to end up to get there no but
for me the show is hilarious but Lily's
hilarious Robin's hilarious Barney's
hilarious Marshall Marshall arias but
Ted okay so how epic is this shirt right
here I mean does it get more epic than
this shirt I bought this shirt on Etsy
it's where I get like the most creative
t-shirts and when I got in the mail and
I put it on Danny was like oh I want
that shirt it says los Pollos hermanos
which if you don't know is the fast food
chain in Breaking Bad and if you haven't
seen Breaking Bad you absolutely have to
it's an amazing show which I know a lot
of you have seen it it's incredible and
I really judge a lot of shows based on
how they end and Breaking Bad had one of
the best endings I've ever seen me
personally I thought it was I thought it
was amazing Sons of Anarchy also had a
great ending everybody hated that ending
and I thought it was a poem it was like
beautiful anyway I'm talking so much in
this video and we haven't even gotten
through the first pile what's wrong with
me this is also a pretty new one try and
take off the dog here this one was a
gift from my friend Stephanie I'm not
exactly sure where she bought it it
doesn't say it here wait did Stephanie
buy this for me I don't remember but
this is a Nike t-shirt I don't think
it's from the brand Nike but it's
supposed to be like the Nike check and
it says just do it which is the Nike
phrase and honestly I can't say the
words just do it without thinking of
Shia LaBeouf but this is actually a
shirt about the walking dead it's a bat
instead of a check mark and this is
blood it's a negan shirt if you watch
The Walking Dead negan
is like the villain this season or these
seasons and he is such a good villain if
you guys haven't seen the Walking Dead
you absolutely have to it's just so good
good doesn't even begin to describe that
it is and then the last shirt it's
pretty new I know it's really bold and
it's really loud but it has Chucky on it
from the Rugrats and I really really
love the Rugrats it kind of makes me sad
that the kids these days are growing up
without the Rugrats like I was having a
conversation with an 11 year old the
other day and I was talking about the
Rugrats and she's like I've never seen
that and I was like what do you mean
you've never seen I got this shirt on
the Selena Gomez like merch website I
know a lot of people have their
reservations about Selena Gomez
especially with her new stuff and her
trying to curl her tongue with an
eyelash curler but I love her and
whatever she wants to do in her music
career i back her up on it cuz I think
that I just feel like Selena Gomez and I
would get along so well she's a cancer
isn't she I get along agree with
cancer's I have to sell in our shirts um
I actually think Selena Gomez was named
after her no way did I make that up
Selena was the movie that made me fall
in love with JLo I mean it was like her
first big thing but I love that movie
and I love sailing out my mom used to
listen to her music all the time it's so
sad about how she passed away and I
think it still hits people till this day
her death was so hard on Sony he went
she's so beautiful and talented so I got
this shirt at Urban Outfitters actually
not that long ago and then I got this
one which this one's my favorite I love
this shirt I was dying for a shirt like
this isn't this one so pretty look how
pretty she looks I picture this with
like black ripped jeans I don't know I
love this shirt and upsetting it if you
saw my John Mayer vlog you would have
known I wore this shirt to the concert I
bought it on the John Mayer like merch
website and I am surprised I am super
surprised that this is the only John
Mayer shirt I have in my pile I remember
when I went to go to the battle Studies
concert I wanted a heartbreak warfare
shirt so bad and he was selling these
shirts on his website that had like this
big heart on it and had the lightning
bolt through it and it was so expensive
it was like oh I'm gonna make my own
t-shirt for the concert so I never got
it and I want that shirt so bad I wonder
if they still have it like on eBay or
like Etsy or Hamazon or something and
then could you believe these are all
Pink Floyd shirts and I have a lot more
where that came from I have Pink Floyd
tank tops I have Pink Floyd sweaters 20%
of my
casual wardrobe is Pink Floyd I've
spoken about this in a video before Pink
Floyd is my dad's favorite band in the
entire world and now it's like a thing I
wore a Pink Floyd shirt in front of him
once and he like went crazy and was like
oh my god being Floyd and then it just
kind of became a thing like every time I
see a Pink Floyd shirt I have to buy it
it's like this weird thing I do like a
few songs though there's like five Pink
Floyd song I really really like but my
dad knows them all
so I'm gonna go through them really
really quickly this one I think I got at
forever 21 this one is just a really
pretty like a pinky blue dreamy tie-dye
ish type of shirt that has hair dye all
over the collar or that's not a collar
this part because I was dyeing my hair
one day and I didn't wear my hair dye
t-shirt I left this on and then I got
hair dye on this shirt
so now I have two hair dye t-shirts phoo
this one is a new one it's another
tie-dye shirt but it says Pink Floyd
1973 US tour and I like this one cuz
it's loud and vibrant and fun and I like
that it kind of goes longer on the side
here at the bottom and I just love that
it looks funky like this is such a sure
my dad would love my dad loves tie-dye
he's so funny the other day we were
talking about Pink Floyd and I was like
what would you consider them like rock
like classic rock or what he was like
neither more psychedelic I was like what
the heck does that even mean I have this
one this one is actually my least
favorite out of all of them because I
don't really think Pink Floyd my look at
this shirt but I do love the style of
this shirt I like that the sides have
these little rings and then you tie them
at the bottom and I love that the neck
does this little triangle cutout thing
so I do love the style of the shirt and
I wear it all the time I just don't like
the image on the front this is a boy's
shirt that I got at Nordstrom I hauled
this a couple months ago and I got a
larger size because this is meant for
little kids I got an XL and I like this
one because it has people on it and
usually my Pink Floyd shirts do not so
this one is a nice little change I also
have this one this is a t-shirt but it
has like little holes cut out on the
shoulders you know really cute really
cute the classic little triangle rainbow
thing and then these two are my favorite
Pink Floyd shirts they're so comfortable
I don't know what it is about these I
wear these all the time I gotta say
probably this is like my most worn
t-shirt ever
this one is so comfortable and I love
the fact that you could just slam it
over your shoulder and you can kind of
wear this in a different way and I love
shoulder t-shirts like this that have
the neck a little bit wider so you can
do that and I just I love it oh wait
there are people on this one too am i
stupid and then this one is extremely
similar they they're like almost the
same shirt only this one says Pink Floyd
in pink and it doesn't have a wide neck
but they're very similar they feel
almost exactly the same and I'm pretty
sure I got both of these either Urban
Outfitters or at forever 21 I can't
remember this one also has people on it
so obviously I'm a freaking liar okay
and then I just have a few random
miscellaneous shirts that I wanted to
share with you guys cuz I love them this
one is actually brand brand-new I got
our Urban Outfitters like last week and
it's just a Snoopy shirt that says don't
worry be happy' but there's a little
story behind this one
I was recently in LA shooting my fall
and the Oh polish collection and it's
all 70s themed so all the photos are
kind of like 70s ish 70s vibes and in
one of the shoots you'll see as the
week's go on we still got a few weeks
but in one of the shoots I was wearing
this shirt with like blue high-waisted
bell-bottoms I totally looked like Donna
from that 70s show like totally and I
was just so 70s with my record player it
was amazing and I fell in love with the
shirt and I went out and bought it
myself I don't know I just it now it
reminds me of the 70s and I kind of
really loved it now this one is from a
website called Martha of Miami
she's like a local Miami in here and all
of her clothes are like Cuban related
and so a lot of her clothes have little
phrases and like little Cuban sayings
and this one is so cute it has
Cuba on it the map of Cuba and then it
says roots which I felt was an amazing
shirt because I mean these are my roots
so I also have a tank top with cellulose
face on it and it says cruising how cute
is that
this one this one got stained and I
don't know how what is this this looks
like I was playing baseball and I slid
into home like what what kind what is
that I can't possibly be here died
because that's all the way down there so
I don't know what that is but I've
washed this like three million times so
I guess that's thing there I want to say
I got this shirt off of a random website
that had to do with dogs it says I was
normal three
what is baked Oh then maybe that's what
this is I use this shirt to spray paint
something one day and I wonder if this
is like spray-paint residue because this
totally is this is like a hot orange
spray paint stain but anyway I clearly
relate to this shirt because I was I was
normal three dogs ago and then I have
this every time I wear this shirt
Danny's like why I don't get it he
doesn't like avocados can you believe
that
avocados go well with everything with
toast with rice and so many more things
that I can think of right now
I mean guacamole oh hey guacamole I
don't know I got this shirt on Etsy I'm
pretty sure I even have avocado socks my
friend Stephanie I just found out she's
having a girl and I got her little
onesie with two avocados on it it says
let's have a cuddle I mean I just I love
it I love all the puns I love avocado
tastes great looks great I love it okay
guys so those were my favorite t-shirts
this is kind of like my t-shirt
collection I get emotionally attached to
some shirts for example there are a few
out here I want to share with you oh
look there's another Pink Floyd shirt
but that's not a t-shirt it's like a
sweater that's not a sweater but you
know like this this this shirt this
shirt this was my dad's when I was
younger it is covered in stains there's
white paint here from when he painted
the house like ten years ago and it has
not fallen off it has a fender on it
which is his favorite guitar and then
every time I wear this t-shirt I look at
it I just I think of my dad and it's
nice my mom is probably like is this a
video all about your dad are there any
teachers I remind you of me
I'm with my mom all the time I can't get
rid of that shirt no matter how hard I
try just like this this is a random
t-shirt it's not even a t-shirt like
it's just like a random sure forever 21
I bought this my senior year of high
school why do I still have it
I don't even wear this but for some
reason for the life of me I can't get
rid of this have this thing in my mind
where I can't get rid of certain things
that I had before I became
kathleenlights before like the YouTube
thing happened I feel like having things
like this in my drawer keep me grounded
and it kind of makes me feel more
appreciative I'm pretty sure I asked my
dad for $20 to buy this shirt every time
I do spring cleaning or I get rid of a
bunch of stopping I hate holding onto
things I don't use but I can't I will
not get rid of this shirt just like this
shirt this is
really funny Danny got this for me like
five years ago before you do when we
were struggling in Mississippi and III
in the military doesn't make as much
money as you would think and Danny got
me this when he was at e3 how cute I
cannot get rid of this shirt even though
I don't wear it anymore
oh yeah good times good times also a
shirt I can't get rid of and I don't
even want to tell you how long I've had
this tank top I don't want to tell you
this was my sister's tank top when she
was in high school and she's 7 years
older than me and my high school reunion
is in three years so I don't wanna talk
about that tank top but also another
thing I cannot get rid of for the life
of me okay so yeah that completes this
video these were my favorite t-shirts
leave me a comment down below if you
have a t-shirt you cannot get rid of no
matter what or if you have a very
special t-shirt your favorite band tease
something leave me a comment down below
and tell me the story behind it I would
love to know but that completes us with
