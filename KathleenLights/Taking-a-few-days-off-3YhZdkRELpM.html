told you guys April was going to be an
epic mess there was a hundred things I
had to do in April so many things
happening and I just wanted to post this
video because I need a break and I'm
just going to save any and break so the
other day I had a biopsy done this is
the kind of thing I was avoiding talking
about in recent videos but I feel like
if I just take a break and I don't tell
you why then you're not you're just
going to be like what so without going
into too much detail because honestly
not only is it no one's like business or
anything but people don't care to know
and I know that I know I should keep my
personal life personal but for those of
my subscribers who truly care what's
going on and really enjoy my videos for
me my personality and not just for
makeup I kind of want to keep you in the
loop a little bit but anyway I had a
biopsy done on my boob and I'm fighting
but like I said before I do have
fibrocystic breast disease that's just
when you have like a lot of fibrosis in
your breasts and it was harder to like
do the biopsy because of how much like
fibrosis is in my boob so like my whole
boob is black and blue and I'm okay I'm
finding that this is just a couple of
days ago a biopsy is not like a surgery
or anything they don't knock you out
it's not bad at all it's just like the
after part kind of hurts a bit and then
Danny told me like you know don't film
videos for a week just take a week off
let your cut heal up and I was like dude
it's just about feel like okay I can do
this and I was told me a video yesterday
and like my cut like popped open I don't
know if I put pressure my like picking
something up yesterday when I was
filming I don't know what it was and I
looked out and some of my bra was had
blood on it and it had completely
clothes at least I thought it was
completely closed and I called the
doctor and it's totally fine and this
biopsy honestly just came out of left
field I did not expect to do this
because I actually have the craziest two
weeks ahead of me like the craziest so I
decided that I'm just going to take a
chill pill I'm going to take a week off
I do have to pre-record
because I'm not gonna be able to film at
the end of April because like I said I
have a lot going on so I do have to
pre-record anyway in the next couple
days for that but I know that I'll feel
better if I just take this week off and
really regroup and refocus and I just
want like a week to myself I've been
icing my boobs because when you do a
biopsy like the bruising it's like
really
ugly at least my room so I just want to
like my home and ice my boob and I want
to focus on like kale polish customer
service and you know I want to tackle
other things like kale polish so I think
I'm going to take until next Monday off
and maybe post a video on Wednesday or
maybe I will post a video next Monday
but I'm aiming for next Wednesday I'll
start posting videos again and then I'll
be back for the fact hopefully April
like I said I just I knew it was going
to be a really crazy month for me don't
think I'm giving up on YouTube guys I'm
not I promise I've just been getting a
lot of unexpected purples and I'm
actually doing the summer photo shoot
for Te'o polish at the end of this month
as well and I can't wait for you guys to
see that to see I usually want to post
videos like this I'm like I'm really
sorry you know life got in the way but
honestly it's okay to take a break
sometimes my head is going on like a
million different miles with so many
things happening right now yeah I just
wanted to post this video because
usually I update you guys if I'm not
posting a video on Twitter or on
Instagram but I just wanted to make the
announcement here I hope you guys
understand it's just a week it's just
like four four video days if you think
about it it's just four videos I'll be
missing but another majority of you are
super super accepting and understand so
yet one suppose this video just update
you I'd never want to leave you guys
hanging it's gonna end this video now I
love you guys and I will see you next
week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
