and make this video really quick I've
been kind of doing these often where I'm
just like sitting down and filming and
not much beauty or not much like
creativity is going into my videos but I
do plan to make a complete change that
I'm so sorry there wasn't a video that
went up on went on Friday I just came
back from vacation I was there for about
a week I had enough pre-recorded videos
to post so that there weren't any
missing videos but the day that I got
back I had plans to film the very next
day and I got so sick I got like a
really bad cold I could barely breathe
like my nose was stuffy for days it's
still pretty stuffy but I feel so much
better my immune system must suck
because I know I get sick all the time I
get sick like five times a year with a
cold like it never fails but it's
probably because in Las Vegas the
weather was like 30 degrees and we were
on a balcony most of the time and being
in like that constant cold and it was
really really windy I guess it got me
sick and I tried to film my makeup
collection like an storage video I
haven't filmed one of those in a really
long time and I tried to film one that
was just sneezing throughout the whole
video like my eyes were watering my
makeup wasn't staying on I just felt
like utter crap so I figured I would
just scrap it I couldn't really get
through it
so I apologize about the missing video
Friday I filmed my boxycharm unboxing
video earlier today when I felt a little
bit better so that video should go up
tomorrow if you are watching this on
Sunday when I post and then tomorrow
morning I'm gonna film my makeup
collection video I should feel pretty
solid tomorrow like back to normal
because I'm feeling pretty good today
it's the first day where I don't wake up
super weak and groggy and stuffy and I'm
so sorry I know have been promising a
makeup collection for so long I even
said I would get it out before December
and here we are halfway through December
there is just something I don't I've
mentioned it in a few videos already but
I just hate constantly talking about it
but anxiety has been pretty bad lately I
don't know what it is I don't know
fits like the stress of the whole kale
polish thing and trying to get that
situated but I just um I don't know I
actually don't think has anything to do
with kale polish because usually like
that kind of stress is okay because it's
like work-related and I love what I do
and the anxiety I'm feeling is like so
weird it's it's almost like worrisome
anxiety like I'm constantly worried
about something but I don't I don't know
what I'm worried about
I feel like there's something in my mind
that isn't letting me just like I don't
know I haven't posted a makeup tutorial
in over a week on my channel it's been
like two weeks I just don't feel myself
I haven't felt very inspired or very
creative and the garage open so that
freaks her out every time I use the
garage open but the visible watch silly
portal is just the garage
right down sweetie but I made myself a
promise that when I came back from
vacation you know I let myself really
unwind for a week and I really did it
was it was amazing it had so much fun in
Las Vegas with my friends and my family
and I told myself that as soon as I got
back it was back to business it was you
know the old Kathleen was coming back no
more like sad anxiety Kathleen I'm not
gonna let my anxiety when I've been
doing so good with it and I don't want
it to control me so I know I've been
asking for this like a hundred times but
leave a comment in this video what
videos you would like to see for me
request anything requests stirred and
makeup looks be descriptive be very
specific what would you like to see from
me I want to really expand my channel
and just get you know back into the
swing of things cuz I have been feeling
bummed out for a few months it's been a
few months and I'm not gonna let myself
feel bad anymore
we all have those moments where you know
we feel off in life and that's okay but
as long as we try to you know pull
through and push forward and work on
happiness that's what matters so that's
what I'm doing
please leave me all the advice below
what kind of videos you would like it
doesn't only have to be tutorials what
other kinds of videos do you want to see
for me maybe more clothing hauls or
whatever you want just leave it below
I'm feeling pretty good I mean I was I
was sick these past couple days but I'm
feeling pretty good I want to get back
to beauty and makeup and those things
that I really really love as for Kayla
polish I just I want to thank you guys
so much a lot of you guys have been
tagging me in your post a lot of you
guys are receiving the polishes and I've
been so overwhelmed there were so many
orders and I didn't think that that many
people loved nail polish as much as I do
makeup is one thing but nail polish is
like a whole nother world for me and I'm
trying to get the orders out as best as
I can I will say that there have been
some trial and errors happening and I
guess that's just life when you first
open a brand are gonna be a few bumps
but I'm working on getting all the
orders out getting all the customers
happy we're really crunching down on
that customer service you if you have
any questions please email customer
service we're responding to everyone and
I'm just trying to make you guys happy
at the customer is first I want you guys
to be really happy with your purchase
and with your experience and just I'm
trying so hard to work on that I love
you guys thank you for being supportive
all the time even when I feel it I'm
feeling a little rocky even when I'm not
feeling so great and yeah that's all I
wanted to say look at my little huggsy a
subscriber gave this to me isn't it
beautiful
oh sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
sorry I'm sorry you all right are you
