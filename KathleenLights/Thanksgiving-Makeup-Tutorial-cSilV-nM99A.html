look right here and it is perfect for
Thanksgiving
first I'm starting off with my NYX
eyeshadow base and skin tone and I had
already primed with Urban Decay's primer
potion before this
now I'm taking this eyeshadow by Mac it
is called saddle and I am working this
into the crease and really really
blending it out I'm adding a lot of it
to my crease just cuz I really wanted to
show up it's a very very warm brown and
it just screams Thanksgiving I love it
then I'm gonna take some scotch tape and
put it on the back of my hand a few
times so it's not so sticky and it will
pull on the skin around my eyes and I'm
doing this so when I take off the tape
it looks like a really nice sharp cat
eye now I'm taking my Maybelline Color
tattoo pure pigment in breaking bronze
this beautiful gold color and I'm gonna
spray with fix+ so it could be extra
pigmented and pack that on my lid I'm
gonna be putting it on my entire lid but
I'm not gonna be passing the crease can
you just see it just looks like liquid
gold thumbs up this video if you know
what commercial I just referred to
anyway now I'm going in with like my
absolute favorite eyeshadow of all time
and it is Brown script by Mac I don't
know why it's taking me so long to get
this I just recently got it and it's
like all I use I'm gonna be focusing
this on the outer V of my eye and then
bringing it into the crease and I'm
gonna be doing this for a while I'm just
really building the color up as opposed
to going in with like a super strong
hand I'm slowly building it little by
little and really blending it out
you just want to take your time with
this and really really blend it so it
looks seamless
now I'm gonna take my wet and wild
vanity palette and I'm just using this a
deep chocolate color in the palette you
can use any deep chocolaty color that
you have and I am just putting this or
the tape meets my skin just to deepen
out just to deepen that little corner of
it
next I'm taking my Stila smudge eyeliner
thing in the shade downsell and it's
this nice warm brown and i'm going to
tightline with this and use it on my
waterline as well then I just go back
into that same color in the banovic
palette and I just wanted to deepen it
up a little bit more taking the cream
color in that palette and using that as
my brow bone highlight really quickly
I'm gonna go on to the rest of my face
before I finish underneath my eyes I
have already taken off the tape around
my eyes and you can see it's a pretty
sharp kind of eye a little effect going
on there and I'm priming my face with
the L'Oreal magic lumi light infusing
primer I love it it's really
moisturizing and I'm going in with my it
cosmetics bye bye redness neutralizing
correcting cream you guys know this is
like holy gross that is for me I'm
obsessed with it so I'm just using this
as my foundation and I'm going really
fast because I wanted it to be mainly a
eye to eye tutorial but I know that some
people like to see the whole face look
and all that jazz so that's why I'm
doing that
I'm taking my mac prolongwear concealer
and I'm using this underneath my eyes to
really brighten it up and to cover my
dark circles oh I also filled in my
eyebrows already by the way I have an
eyebrow tutorial I'll link that down
below if you're interested and of course
typical me I'm setting it with my MSF
natural going back to the eyes I'm gonna
take that same deep chocolatey color and
I'm gonna run this underneath my lash
line because I wanted it to be really
like sultry and smoky and then I also
added some Brown script as well because
I wanted it to be a little bit warmer so
I just took the time to blend that out
for a while and then I also blended the
super sharp edges that the tape of me
because I do like the sharpness but I
like it to be a little less like super
sharp and a little bit more like smoky
and now I'm gonna put on some false
lashes and then add some liquid liner on
the top but I wanted to do like a pretty
thick liquid liner and okay guys do not
make fun of me because I do not wear
false lashes like I never ever wear them
and they just did not turn out right I
tried my best and I'm just not a false
lash wearer it didn't look good like you
could totally see the band you'll see at
the end of the video and you're gonna
make fun of me but be nice because I
mean it was my first time guys so anyway
I used the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer to
kind of warm up my face a little bit and
then I went in with benefits hoola and I
am contouring with the hoola bronzer
used my favorite blush of all time and
that is max Melba it's like the most
beautiful color seriously if you don't
have it get it it's beautiful I never
wear blush like hardly ever
I'm not a big blush girl but really this
color is beautiful then I went in with
the bombs mary lou manizer highlighter
Thank You Gabby for giving this to me
because I love it it's beautiful
and I also use that as my inner corner
highlight on my eyes as well oh okay
brush your hair Kathleen seriously get
it together um I took max lip pencil and
insync and I never wear this because I
feel like it's too pale and chalky but I
I like to use it to kind of take the
pigment away from my lips because my
lips are really pigmented and red I'm
going in with Mac's velvet teddy
lipstick it's like the perfect nudies
fall color but it does come off a little
bit Brown on me so I just went back over
with a lip pencil to give it more of a
pinky shade so yeah guys that is it that
is the look I came up with I hope you
guys enjoyed it okay look you see just
see the band of the fake lashes yeah
it's bad it's embarrassing okay but I'll
get better
I mean I'll try to get better bear with
me guys bear with me I hope you enjoyed
