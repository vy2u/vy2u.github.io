about me tag which I know is like the
oldest tag ever it's like so old I don't
even know if anybody watches these
videos anymore
but I wanted to just kind of like film a
video about myself okay I just wanted to
film a video just so that you can get to
know me better just buy these you know
like 20 questions think there's more
whatever I found this
I found these questions I know that this
tag was going around a while ago but
since you know I'm new I'm new here on
YouTube and I just wanted to just you
know film this kind of video so I found
the questions and yeah I'm just gonna go
ahead and answer them okay first
question do you have a middle name no I
don't have a middle name but when I was
younger I was obsessed with telling
people that my name was my middle name
was Victoria I don't know why I always
just tell people my name is Kathleen
Victoria it's not my name is just
Kathleen um but my dad had told me once
when I was little that he wanted to give
me a middle name and he wanted it to be
Victoria my mom didn't want it so they
didn't put it and I thought that was
like the coolest conjunction like
caffeine Victoria so for a long time I
told people that that was my name

was yeah creative writing I loved I

your favorite drink it is definitely
Sunkist I love Sunkist I love orange
soda in general but I don't like Fanta
