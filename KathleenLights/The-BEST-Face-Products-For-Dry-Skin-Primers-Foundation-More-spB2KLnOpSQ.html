my favorite face products for dry skin
not all face products obviously but
mainly the base products like everything
you lay down before you go in with
bronzer blush highlight and all that
good stuff so I'm gonna be talking about
my favorite primers foundations
concealers and powders I actually took
this video idea from Jamie Jamie Page
Beauty I will link her video down below
she did a video just like this and I
thought that would be a great idea for
me to do as well so all credit goes to
her I will link her video down below I
loved it
she shared really great products and we
actually have some similar products so
anyway I've really decided to narrow it
down to products that are very hydrating
and very moisturizing as you guys know I
have very dry skin and all the products
I'm going to talk about today sit really
well on my dry skin and it just works
with my skin now I'm not saying these
are the ultimate best but these are my
favorite and I highly recommend
everything I'm gonna talk about I wanted
to skip unlike the shimmery and the
glowy kind of products for example for
primers I love the NYX born to glow
illuminator it's also great for dry skin
but it has like a pearly finish like it
looks shimmery and like a sheen on your
face those are not the kind of products
I'm gonna be talking about today not
like liquid illuminators or anything
like that nothing very highlighting just
strictly moisturizing hydrating products
at work for dry skin types because maybe
you have dry skin but you don't want to
be shimmery either I understand this
video is for you so I'm gonna start with
primers the Too Faced hangover X primer
is one of the best primers for dry skin
I don't think it makes your makeup last
all day like it's not a makeup extender
but it just goes on like a moisturizer
that just sinks into the skin and all of
a sudden your face feels nice and plump
and hydrate it it smells like coconuts
it has coconut water in it and it's
silicone free I love this I kind of feel
the same way about all three of these
partners I'm going to share with you I'm
excessive and I have to talk about three
even though I feel like sometimes they
do the same thing this is the glossy a
priming moisturizer so similar to the
Too Faced one feels like a moisturizer
going on your skin it kind of feels like
your skin just drink some water your
skin feels very very like refreshed and
all the dry flakiness is
and it's ready for makeup this one
though this one I do think it makes my
makeup last a little bit longer than the
other two this is the laura geller
spackle hydrating moisturizing under
makeup primer this kind of goes on clear
kind of like the same consistency as the
other one kind of milky but this one I
find gets a little bit tackier than the
other ones a little bit stickier I find
that I have to rub it in a little bit
more but I kind of like that because it
leaves my face super moisturized but a
little bit tacky to where I find that
foundation really sticks to it awesome
for my dry skin another talk less of
water honestly let's talk about
foundations I do have to apologize
though you guys know in my videos I'm
always talking about high-end and
drugstore there's always like a good mix
but when I sat down to film this video
and I grabbed all of my honest like
honest true favorites for dry skin there
weren't many drugstore favorites for
some reason I don't know why I love a
lot of illuminators from the drugstore
like glowy liquidy products but besides
that I don't know why I don't know so
I'm so sorry that there's like 90%
high-end stuff in this video I really do
apologize but the drugstore picks I do
have in this video I do love as well
okay so foundations you guys know my
all-time favorite foundation is the
makeup forever face and body I use the
shade at number 20 this is the
foundation that changed the game for me
I love a lot of foundations not as much
as I love this one it has very light
coverage like very light coverage but it
can build to like a medium coverage you
can put layer after layer after layer of
this it's very water based which is
awesome it looks beautiful on my skin
even when my skin is the driest the
driest this looks flawless but as I say
all good things must come to an end
make it forever is actually
discontinuing the face and body
foundation I bought a couple backups
they are now replacing it with the water
blend Foundation which is very good I
tried it it's good not as good as this
one though but very similar my next
favourite for dry skin is from the
drugstore and it is the Maybelline fit
me foundation this is the original fit
me they have a matte and poreless one
which is also excellent if you like a
matte foundation this one is the
original and it is so glowy
so DUII I feel like this foundation is
very hit-or-miss I'm someone it really
works for again even when my skin is
feeling so so dry this looks awesome on
top of it doesn't sink into any of the
fine lines it just gives my face a
beautiful glow and I also find that the
coverage is really good on this
foundation considering it's for dry skin
most of my foundations for dry skin have
like a light coverage light to medium
this one layered I can get a really
really great coverage and it does not
look cakey which is the problem a lot of
us dry girls have my next favorite is
probably my Julius out of the bunch
besides my face and body this one just
looks like your Jennifer Lopez it
doesn't have any shimmer or glitter or
anything but it's just so beautiful I
should tell you what this is right this
is the Becca aqua luminous perfecting
foundation this is Jennifer Lopez in a
bottle this foundation has light
coverage but it just evens out your skin
tone it makes your skin look so
beautiful I'm gonna say the same thing
for each foundation it looks like your
skin just drink some water but it does
it looks flawless in photos too in flash
photography this looks beautiful just
glowing young skin I will say though for
some reason I really have to work with
this foundation I kind of didn't like it
at first because I thought it was just
sitting on top of my skin but no this is
the kind of foundation you really have
to work into your skin I have to sit
there and like buff it in circular
motions but once I do it just sinks into
the skin and looks beautiful another
affordable option if you have dry skin
is the Bourjois healthy mix serum you
can't give this in the States but if
you're overseas or like in Boots
I think they sell this in Boots this
foundation is actually very long wearing
on me I like the coverage it looks
really good throughout the whole day it
does have more of like a gel serum --e
consistency which really hydrates my
skin this just makes me look so glowy
this video is so repetitive beautiful
beautiful foundation like one of my
favorites for sure
now I want to talk about a more
luxurious foundation if you are into
luxury makeup and you have dry skin I
really really recommend the goji endo
aqua foundation I think it's similar to
the Georgia I want a luminous silk
foundation that everybody is obsessed
with but I think this one is better this
one lasts longer on my skin it's the
Foundation I'm wearing right now I'm in
the shade two one three
I like the coverage I mean I'm wearing
powder on top which I'll talk about in a
little while but I think it has enough
coverage like I definitely have to build
it up on my cheeks but it never looks
cakey it just always looks fresh like
you look fresh and healthy when you wear
it this video is gonna be a million
years long let's talk about concealers I
got to give a shout out to the
Maybelline fit me concealer has been
holding it down for me for years this
concealer it's very fresh-looking it has
a duly finish you definitely have to set
this because I'm not it will crease but
it doesn't look cakey underneath the
eyes if you have very very dry under
eyes it doesn't emphasize the dryness it
just looks really nice with decent
coverage I think I get like a nice
medium coverage with this this next one
is even do ear is crazy this is the bare
minerals bare skin complete coverage
serum concealer this is a hardcore
concealer guys I think that you either
love this or hate this I have very dry
skin I happen to like this a lot
this has really really good coverage I'm
talking full coverage but it has an
incredible dewy finish I don't know how
they did that but it's like a serum II
concealer and it kind of looks wet on
the face I think with this one though I
do have to spend a little bit longer
blending it out with a Beauty Blender or
a brush or anything if you have dry skin
though I highly recommend you switching
over to a sponge a Beauty Blender it
always gives you like a more of a fresh
finish I do have to spend more time
blending this out because if not it can
look a little bit too much I want to
give a shout outs to the Wet n Wild
highlighting and concealing pen because
I've tried a lot of pen illuminating
concealers or Mike hydrating concealers
like this and this one is my favorite
and it's like three dollars sometimes
I'll put on a concealer and I'll realize
that it looks a little dry I will throw
this right on top and blend it in with
my concealer and this just helps the
other concealer blend out so perfectly
in smooth love this little wet-and-wild
pen and then my last favorite I'm like I
love this product so much I will
definitely be repurchasing this this is
the glossy a stretch concealer I have
mine in the shade light this is the
concealer I'm wearing underneath my eyes
this is the first pop concealer that I
truly truly love this works on blemishes
and
underneath your eyes this works so great
underneath your eyes it's a very glowy
concealer you think it's in a pot it's
drying its cakey no it's not it's so
beautiful I love this it's very very
emollient like when you apply it
underneath your eyes it's like shiny
like this is very very dewy but it has
amazing coverage as well I like this one
more than the bareMinerals one because
it's easier to blend out for me I just
have to tap it in this is a concealer
you have to set though right away like
right away because it's so creamy it
will crease and you can even use this
like on all on your entire face like
it's amazing okay let's talk about
powders you guys already know that the
RCM a no color powder is hands-down like
my favorite powder of all time
when it comes to being a powder that has
like no color you know not like a powder
foundation or anything like that this
one is my favorite I like it way more
than the Laura Mercier translucent
powder that powder is good I like it but
if my skin is really really really dry I
can't use it it will emphasize my
dryness this one never emphasizes my
dryness there's no white cast in photos
it will set my under eye concealer it
will bake my face it will set my whole
face it will do it all I love this baby
I want to talk about these products
really quick because even though people
consider these highlighters they're not
to me and they are the hourglass ambient
lighting powders some of these I really
really don't like like dim light does
not work for my skin tone I just don't
like it some of their new like strobing
highlighters are not my favorite others
are good but these ambient lighting
powders are so ideal for us dry skin
that the price tag is worth it in my
opinion I used to knock these off like
those hourglass powders so pricey they
suck it up but they're just made like
nothing is I love using ethereal light
this is ethereal light it's like a white
powder but it's not chalky at all
it's like perfect for us it has a little
bit of a sheen to it and I like to use
this to set my under eye concealer and
then I use this one in luminous light
whenever I want kind of like more of an
all-over glow to my face
okay so now let's talk about powders
with color in them not translucent color
ones from the drugstore I actually do
have a powder I really really like that
I think is great for dry skin it is the
fit me powder by Maybelline I think the
whole
that me range is great for dry skin this
is in the shade 135 creamy natural I use
this one to set my under eye concealer
or like in my t-zone this powder feels
like butter when I blend it they also
have a fit me matte and poreless powder
which I've never tried but their
original one is so creamy to the touch
it feels velvety on your hands doesn't
emphasize any of my dryness it almost
makes my skin look very healthy and
youthful for a powder it's really really
really great and then my other favorite
is so pricy okay this I've just come to
the conclusion that this is my favorite
powder I've ever discovered in like a
powder foundation kind of thing this is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk compact
dual use powder compact this is like a
luminous silk foundation in a compact
I'm gonna assume it doesn't say
foundation but there's coverage to this
and it's actually pretty decent coverage
for being a powder I love this I love
this this was so pricey I got it during
the vib sale but it is beautiful this
sets my makeup flawlessly like I set my
makeup all the time now I set my makeup
using this today and even though I was
like packing on the powder I was like
putting it all over my face my face
never looked powdery never looks cakey
never looks dry it just looks like you
set your foundation with like a velvety
soft natural powder that just always
looks good I do want to mention a
affordable alternative I don't think
it's as good and I don't think it's a
dupe but I also really really like the
bourgeois healthy balance powder I have
mine in 52 vanilla this has a very
creamy luxurious texture to it as well
the Giorgio Armani one is a little bit
better for dry skin a little bit more
luminous looking but this one is really
nice and doesn't emphasize my dry skin
even though it says it's a matte powder
okay so that completes this video those
were my favorite primers foundations
concealers and powders for dry skin if
you have dry skin and there's something
that you absolutely love that I didn't
mention today please please write it
