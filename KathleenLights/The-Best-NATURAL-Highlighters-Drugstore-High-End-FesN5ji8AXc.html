simple one I wanted to talk to you guys
about my favorite skin like
natural-looking highlights the other day
I was reorganizing my makeup and I was
just sitting on my floor and swatching
out my highlights and I notice that I
have so many highlights that are so
blinding and are so intense which are
amazing those are the best of course for
like a night out they look so beautiful
in photos but I realized that a lot of
people don't like such an intense
highlight for day to day I just love a
fresh looking highlight the kind of
highlight that just looks like it melts
right into the skin the one you can't
really see so intensely on the face I
mean you could definitely see it it's
highlighting but it's not like so I
thought I would gather all my favorite
beautiful natural-looking highlights and
I would share them with you today I have
five high end and I have five drugstore
so I feel like there's a really good
variety here I will say though that a
lot of these highlights are very very
similar like very similar I guess I just
have a type okay we all have a type I
have a type of highlighter I do have a
light skin tone so certain highlights
will look like a stripe on my face so my
highlights tend to be very light
none of these are like an intense pink
or an intense gold they're very very
natural basically these are the kind of
highlights that I would recommend to
like a bride someone who goes to school
someone who works in the office just
something to give you a glow but it is
in too intense okay I've tucked I'm
talking too much I'm gonna start off
with the one I'm wearing on my face
right now I actually have a combo going
on I'll get into the other one later but
this is the Laura Geller baked
highlighter duo in French vanilla in
Portofino I am only going to be talking
about this one right here this is French
vanilla and I believe Laura Geller has
this highlight sold separately I just
happen to have it in a duo Portofino is
beautiful too but this one's more like
an intense highlight I'm wearing French
vanilla at the very tops of my
cheekbones just to give a little bit of
a pop right there I love this so much
because it just doesn't look like a
stark highlight on the face
none of these do I feel like I'm gonna
get really repetitive in this video but
when you look at it in the pan and looks
almost like an under eye setting powder
because it's so light and there's not
much Sheen to it it kind of looks flat
compared to the Portofino side but when
you swatch it on the skin it just
catches the light so beautifully and it
looks so natural it's one of those
highlights
can definitely build it up though I mean
I put like two layers on my face it's so
buildable you can actually make this
pretty intense if you put a lot on I
love it and I don't wear it as often as
I should because when I put it on today
I was like oh why don't I wear this more
the formula is really beautiful it's
very very creamy it's a baked product so
it just melts right into the skin and it
doesn't emphasize any texture it just
looks so beautiful I really love french
vanilla from laura geller
definitely check it out the next one I
want to talk about I'm sure you saw this
coming a mile away I don't even want to
talk about this for that long because I
feel like I'm mentioning it in every
video and it is the essence pure nude
highlighter this is my favorite natural
highlight from the drugstore it's so
incredibly affordable but so incredibly
beautiful this is definitely one of
those hidden gems at the drugstore if
you haven't tried this yet please try it
out it's such a natural beautiful look
to the skin this one I feel would work
for even more skin tones than that one
whenever you feel like your face is too
matte you just pop on some of this and
it brings your skin back to life I have
this underneath the french vanilla
highlight I like put it all over my
cheeks I put a little bit of it on my
forehead on my chin it's one of those
products that for me works in multiple
ways I can get a big brush like I used
this one today it's just like a tart
brush I dipped it into this product and
I applied it pretty much everywhere like
a soft dusting and it gave my skin like
the most natural glow but then I took a
more precise brush and really packed it
on my cheeks I obsessed by the way when
I show you close-up swatches throughout
this video please don't judge them by
the swatches on my hands these are
definitely those kind of highlights that
you have to apply to the skin because
the first time i swatched the essence
highlight on my hand I was like okay
like I mean it's a nice blend and then
when I put it on my face I was like oh
my gosh okay so my next favorite is more
of a recent discovery for me and is a
pricey one but it is so beautiful this
is the widest o2 shake la lumière
divine very beautiful packaging but very
fingerprint e this highlight is so
elegant and beautiful it's so soft on
the skin it looks really similar to the
Laura Geller French vanilla but this one
is a little bit more of a champagne
undertone the formula is really creamy
and it doesn't emphasize the texture
underneath the only thing I don't love
about the intense like Instagram
highlighting look is that it can kind of
emphasize the texture of your skin
underneath because it's so metallic that
it will just pick up skin texture these
highlights don't have that problem I
love using this in my inner corners as
my brow bone highlight on my nose like
everywhere such a good one it is pricey
but I mean it's I just love it okay so
the next highlight I want to talk about
is probably the most natural-looking one
out of all of them and that is the
wooden wild color icon bronzer in the
shade to reserve your cabana clearly not
the bronzer first of all this powder is
q pengus using so much product in this
highlight and it's also very affordable
so I feel like you know that's a double
win
it also has SPF 15 which I never really
thought I needed SPF in my highlight but
hey if that's what you're into it gives
you the softest glow in the entire world
I actually used this highlight in my
drugstore Bridal makeup tutorial it does
not reflect too much light it just makes
your skin look like it is naturally duly
in those areas if you have very fair
skin you could also put this on other
parts of your face just to make your
skin look a little bit more glowy the
formula on this one is also very very
creamy like when you put your fingers in
this it feels creamy it's so amazing I
don't know
I love how natural this is my next
favorite is a very popular product when
it comes to a natural glow to the skin
this is the ambient lighting powder from
hourglass and I want to talk about the
shade luminous light I have a bunch of
these but I use them all in different
ways this one is the one I use to bring
a little bit of glow to my skin I use
this powder on my entire face not to set
my skin like I'm not setting my face
with any of these powders but after I
set my face and I want my skin to not
look so matte not look so dry I will
dust this on my face and it just brings
just oh this one has a little bit more
of a glow to it but it's still very very
soft there are like little glitters
scattered all throughout it but it does
not show up on the skin as like glitter
it just helps make your skin look a
little bit more luminous I don't know
how to explain it this looks so stunning
on the cheeks this is like the ideal
highlight for a bride it's so soft and
the powder feels like nothing on the
skin the formula of the ambient lighting
powders are very special I don't know
they're very
different to me they're so smooth and
they just look smooth on the skin I
really love this totally recommend it so
my next favorite is actually one that I
recently repurchased because mine was
very old and I think I got rid of it
like a year ago or more this is the hard
candy baked bronzer in the shade Tiki
again also not a bronzer I like but I
don't know that's not a bronzer
I feel like this highlight was so raved
about on YouTube a few years ago and
then it kind of just drifted away into
the dust once the huge stroking
highlighting craze came about in our
lives and took over but this one is
still beautiful it's still a beautiful
highlight it's just a little bit more
natural than what we're used to these
days this one is definitely a little bit
more golden in tone I know that a lot of
people don't like this because of the
ingredients but I don't find that this
irritates my skin and I'm only applying
this specific highlight like right at
the tops of my cheekbones and it has
never dated me or broken me out or given
me like any texture on my highlighting
areas it's really stunning really
beautiful if you're looking for a very
natural highlight that has a slight
golden undertone I would highly
recommend Teke because it's good okay so
the next ones I want to talk about are
these from cover FX they're both the
same type of highlighter only they're
different colors these are the perfect
light highlighting powders and I have
the shade moonlight and sunlight
moonlight is definitely my favorite it's
more suited for my skin tone versus
sunlight that's just a little bit deeper
in tone you can't tell it's just
slightly more golden tone and if I'm not
careful it could look a little bit too
dark for me so I usually just go for
moonlight that's a little bit more
champagne a little bit a little pinky
err anyway they're both very very
stunning natural lit-from-within
highlights
I love these it's definitely one of
those highlights that if you were to go
in store and swatch it on the back of
the hand you would be like oh this is
not going to do much and it almost feels
like powdery when you put your finger in
like a little too powdery but when you
blend it on the face it just transforms
and it melts right into the skin it
doesn't look powdery at all it's the
kind of highlight that when you're like
standing in front of me and I'm talking
to you you can't town wearing highlight
but if I turn my face and the light hits
it in a certain angle it looks so
beautiful and glowy the light needs to
hit perfect
in order for it to really stand out but
that's what I love about it because it
just looks so natural it doesn't look
like you're forced highlight to the skin
so I love these by coverfx they're
really good okay so next up I have a
highlighting face palette and it's by
elf this is the illuminating palette it
comes with four different shades this is
so underrated I feel like no one really
loves this because it is such a natural
highlighting product it's not gonna be
like a Nastasia glow Kate where you look
like Jennifer Lopez when you put it on
but a little bit more wearable while
depending on what your definition of
wearable is I think anything is wearable
if I'm going to be honest I'm only
really talking about these two at the
bottom I don't really wear these this
one is a little bit to oranjee tone for
me I don't like the glitter in this one
and this one is too close to my skin
tone to where you can't really see it
but these two are very very pretty these
colors are really beautiful you just
have to be careful with them when you're
applying them because they're a little
bit powdery it's one of those products
you're definitely gonna want to like tap
off your brush before you go in and
apply it to your cheeks because if not
you'll just apply too much I love these
mixed especially that's my favorite way
to wear them they just pair so nicely on
the skin because it's not too vanilla
but it's not too pink
they look very natural and very
beautiful this palette is so inexpensive
it has a great mirror in it and I think
it's a natural highlight but I don't
think it's non-existent I think it still
looks really pretty on the skin okay so
I only have two more products to share
with you this one right here is my
all-time favorite highlighter which I'm
sure you saw this coming this is the
Laura Mercier matte radiance baked
powder highlight in the shade 0-1 light
this is the highlight that opened the
doors for me and made me fall in love
with a more natural looking highlight
when I first discovered this I was like
I feel like the tie light is the perfect
mix between an intense metallic and a
very very very natural vanilla highlight
it's like the perfect little baby
because it gives you more of a glow than
some of these do but it still doesn't
emphasize any texture underneath it
still doesn't make you look like you
have like a freakin highlight stripe on
your face it's not too metallic it's not
shimmery it's the perfect amount of glow
it looks stunning I've worn this like a
hundred times and I have no dent in this
this is definitely my most used
highlight I take it with me every single
time I travel I love my GI powder
highlight and citrine that one has
become like another favorite of mine
like a true true favorite but that one
is very intense that one is very glowy
very JLo this one is just more natural
and this is the highlight I always reach
for on a day-to-day basis it's my most
used it looks so pretty even when I have
barely any makeup on like the simplest
makeup look this will just tie it all
together okay and then the last
highlight I want to talk about is more
of an honorable mention I don't really
use this one that much but I think you
would really really like this if you
have like porcelain snow white skin this
is the city color intense exposure
highlighting powder I do use this a lot
but not on like my cheeks I use this as
a brow bone highlight as an inner corner
highlight I use this on the eyes a lot
just not that much on the face but like
I said if you're very fair I think you
would really like this on your face it's
very very light it has that vanilla
creamy undertone this mofo really
surprised me because it's so inexpensive
I mean you could tell by the packaging
it's not the most luxurious packaging
but the product inside is actually
pretty good it reflects a lot of light
on the face because it is such a light
powder but it does have a sheen to it it
gives you a very natural subtle glow
snot like overly luminous it gives you
more of just like that light to the skin
it just picks up the light nicely and
kind of brings more focus to your
cheekbones the formula is a little bit
too powdery for me like if you're not
careful and you apply too much of this
you can kind of see it sitting on top of
the skin because it is slightly chalky
but if you apply the right amount it
does look really really stunning okay
guys so that completes this video these
were my favorite natural skin like
highlights I feel like so many companies
are coming out with boom highlights
which are amazing
I love my drawer full but sometimes I
like a little bit more of a tone down
glow I know they were all pretty similar
but I just wanted to give you guys some
options so I hope you don't mind that
and leave me a comment down below if you
have a highlight at home that you're
obsessed with and that is a natural
looking highlight if I didn't mention it

discovering those kinds of highlights
it's like a thing I don't know so yeah
