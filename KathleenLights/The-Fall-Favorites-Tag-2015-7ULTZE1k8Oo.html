a tag video I don't know I haven't done
a tag in a long time so today's video is
going to be a little bit of a chill one
just a little bit of a talky chatty one
there are a bunch of fall tags like
throughout the course of time here on
YouTube I think I even did one last year
maybe there are a bunch but Jacqueline
Hill recently created one or like her
own little version of a fall tag she
called it the fall favorites tag and she
tagged me and so many of you guys when
she tagged me in that video we're like
Jacqueline tagged you in that video you
better do it so here I am doing it for
you guys I might have this video up
later than usual I'm not exactly sure
how my uploading schedule is looking
like right now when you're watching this
because you guys know that all my videos
are like pre-recorded right now by the
way if you are wondering I just filmed
this makeup look and it's already up in
my channel but I'll link it down below
you in proceed okay so I'm just gonna go
ahead and get Porter Porter don't drown
my shirt don't you oh my clothes I'm
just gonna read the questions and get
started on this little Taggy tag my nose
is running why oh better no I better not
get sick the first question is favorite
fall candle favorite candle in the fall
and it's this one right here if you guys
have been watching my channel since last
year last year is actually when I
discovered this candle for the very
first time and it changed my life you
guys know how obsessed I was with it
it was in the favourites video it was in
the background of all my videos for like
three months like during the fall in
winter I also like to burn it in the
winter though as well let me just tell
you what it is right this is the bath
and Bodyworks candle and it is
marshmallow fireside this is last year's
packaging because when I discovered it I
fell in love so much that I bought a ton
of like ton of backups and I only like
to burn it in the fall in winter so I
have been saving last year's candles to
burn this year but I also bought like
ten already this year for this fall with
the new singer in my opinion this is the
best candle bath and Bodyworks makes
it's right up there with how I feel
about mahogany teak wood
they're like these those are my ultimate
favorite bath and Bodyworks candles this
smell is unreal let me read you a little
like the little notes it says a sweet
toasty end to a long cold day toasted
marshmallows and sumptuous vanilla cream
blend with comforting aroma of rich
smoldering woods I think that is what I
really love about this something very
woodsy and like fiery about it which i
think makes it really unique I love this
but like I said I like to burn this in
the winter as well but if I'm gonna talk
about a candle that I strictly like in
the fall leaves by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works is
amazing I don't have any to share with
you right now but I already purchased
some recently the candles were on sale
and I bought a ton of marshmallow
fireside and a ton of leaves the candle
leaves is what fall smells like to me
leaves that candle is fall okay now that
I've been talking about this candle for
an hour let's move on the second
question is a favorite lip color now I
am a little bit biased
Milou bust my favorite fall dip color
Elise obviously this year has been the
over a long lasting liquid lipstick in
Miami fever this is the I'm wearing
right now to me this is like the
ultimate warm pumpkin spice delicious
fall shade and it looks good on everyone
if you guys follow me on Twitter I have
been retweeting a lot of people wearing
this color and it looks pretty on deep
chocolatey skin tones and I'm super
super fair skin tones I love it I think
it's so beautiful for this time of year
for spa for spa well for fall
specifically because it has like that
warm terra cotta miss to it so that for
sure is my favorite fall lip color at
least this fall next question is a
favorite drink now
I love coffee all year round but during
the fall I almost drown my coffee in
cinnamon so anything cinnamony that is
my favorite drink at Starbucks I love
getting the chai latte during this time
of year because it
it has like almost that like cinnamony
taste it has like that kick that I love
that spice that's the word I was looking
for like that spicy kick but I will say
that being from Miami like being from
Florida it doesn't get colder than like
70 degrees in the fall time so I really
like the pumpkin spice frappuccinos I
have never even tasted a pumpkin spice
latte I know it seems crazy everybody
loves them but it's never cold here I do
sacrifice and pretend it's cold and get
the chai lattes because they're so good
but I love a pumpkin spice Frappuccino
in the fall even though it's cold I like
it because it's hot here all the time ex
question is favorite blush and
immediately I thought of this bad boy
right here I haven't used it in a real
long time because I only use it in the
fall time and I haven't used it um since
last year last fall and it is from these
two for collection which these are
pretty affordable when it comes to
high-end they're sold at Sephora but I
think these are like 15 dollars for
these blushes and it is their micro
smooth blush in the shade tea rose
tickle this is what it looks like it's
such a beautiful mauve and I like it
because it has like a really shimmery
side and then a more like satin side so
I do like that it has a sheen to it even
though it is a mauve it just brings life
to my cheeks and it's that beautiful
dusty rose shade that I think is so
pretty this time of year I love to your
rose tickle definitely go try out these
micro smooth blushes because they don't
get enough credit this is it right here
as you can see it has a little bit of a
sheen and it's a nice natural dusty rose
shade but next question favorite
clothing item 150% boots any kind of
boots booties combat boots come buy
boots in my favorite any type of boot
and I'm gonna revert back to the fact
that I live in Miami it's people here
don't wear boots that often because of
the weather but oh I I find a way
and I really wanted to show you guys
these specifically because they're
really tall and really cool and I think
they might still have them on the
website I'm gonna look for it and link
it down below I got these at forever 21
really really affordable boots they have
like the faux leather and they strap up
all their high they don't go over my
knees I mean I'm really I'm 5 - I'm
pretty short but they don't go over my
knees but they're really really high
boots and I love them because they're
open-toed and I showed these in my shoe
collection video and someone commented
which was so funny someone commented
like living in Canada I will never
understand open toed boots it doesn't
make sense which is it so funny I was
cracking up it's true it doesn't make
sense
why why would you want to freeze your
toes but in Miami you don't you don't
freeze your toes cause it's never cold
so I love these boots because I think
that the open toe gives it a little bit
of a different like edgy look it gives
it it's different and I really really
like that I love this color it's like
that taupe cement looking color
beautiful these boots are so cool to me
and they were so inexpensive I love just
let myself with this little string I
love boots in the fall time love I live
in them even if my toes sweat in between
each other
got that toe sway toe sweat in my boots
next question is a favorite fall movie
Jacqueline also said this but I feel
like this will be everyone's answer and
it is hocus pocus hocus pocus is the
best Halloween movie ever created it
really is it's the best movie ever when
it comes to Halloween the best movie it
just takes me back to my childhood it
really does every time I watch it I'm
just like I haven't recorded on my DVR I
love it but um one that I also love that
also kind of takes me back is Halloween
town that's like the Disney Channel
movie Halloween town is awesome there's
like a bunch of Halloween towns but like
the first one is my favorite I love
Halloween town that one it's such a fun
fall movie how the ween is
cool I love that movie favorite fall TV
show now this question is basically like
I guess like which show do you enjoy
watching in the fall but oh it's raw
matter
honestly all my shows are coming back
all my shows are like they all have thaw
premieres so I'm excited for so many I'm
someone who like watches 30 shows at
once and they were all gone but they're
all coming back but I think the one that
I am most excited to watch is the
Walking Dead I'm so excited I think it
comes back in October I'm not exactly
sure The Walking Dead and how to get
away with murder I'm so excited for
those two shows so excited and I'm
obsessed with scandal as you guys know
but bye
I like how to get away with murder this
is much more than scandal I know don't
kill me but I do because how to get away
with murder doesn't hurt my feelings but
then the Mindy project came back this
fall as well so I mean I'm excited for
all my shows but the first one
definitely being The Walking Dead well
the way that it ended favorite
Thanksgiving food can I say mashed
potatoes even though I have that like
all the time I just feel like you can't
have Thanksgiving without potatoes
mashed potatoes is one of my favorite
it's my comfort food
every time I'm sick I don't even know if
you're supposed to eat mashed potatoes
when you're sick but every time I'm sick
mash potatoes
any excuse I'm sad mashed potatoes it is
my comfort food it honestly makes me
feel better I don't know if it's in my
mind but it does so I need to have
mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving oh oh no
no no you know what else okay okay I
have a better one not a better one but
this one's more Thanksgiving I love I
had it for the first time like three
years ago and ever since I had it I was
like must have it every year it's not
apple pie I think it's called apple
crumb pie or apple crumble pie because
I'm not a fan of apple pie I love
pumpkin pie but I don't love apple pie
this is different maybe one of you guys
can explain it to me in the comments
it's like an apple pie but it has like
the crumbs all over like the top layer
is just wrong
is that what it's called apple crumble
pie let me know down below but that is
my favorite Thanksgiving dessert I love
it and then the last question is
favorite Halloween costume so my
favorite costume that I have been so far
is the most basic the easiest costume
I've ever been and it was two years
three years oh my god now I can't
remember which Halloween it was I think
it was three years ago yes we'll go with
that and I was Charlie Brown and
honestly it was my last minute costume I
didn't know what to do so I just threw
something together I bought a yellow
shirt I cut out a little fabric like I
did the whole Charlie Brown costume my
shoes were the same color as his and my
earrings were a little footballs I
really really loved that costume because
it was Gunther's costume in the show
friends this is really random but one of
my favorite friends episodes of all time
is the Halloween one you know where Ross
is Sputnik and Chandler is the Velveteen
Rabbit
well Gunther is at that party and he's
Charlie Brown and ever since I had seen
that I love Gunther that random I know
but ever since I saw that I was like man
I want to be Charlie Brown and I was
Charlie Brown and I loved it so that has
for sure so far have been my favorite
Halloween costume even though it was put
together in like one day and it wasn't
that creative okay guys so that
