oops I just realized I didn't put my
earrings back on after I took them off
to contour my face sorry they were
supposed to be on and intro I thought
hey guys so today's video is a makeup
tutorial on the look I am wearing right
now I am using the brand new Jaclyn hill
palette by more feet I have gotten so
many requests to film a tutorial with
this palette ever since it came out so I
am so happy to do that for you today a
lot of you guys were asking me to do
swatches and a review on this palette
but I'm sure you guys have seen hundreds
of videos like this already I thought it
would be kind of pointless to do an
entire review when there's so many on
YouTube right now so instead I just
stuck with a tutorial and this is the
look I came up with I really really
wanted to use the blue and this red
together I don't know why I was just
extremely drawn to these two shades when
I first opened the palette so I knew
immediately that's the first look I
wanted to do this is the first time I
ever play with this palette like this
tutorial I just watched most of the
shades but I had never played around
with it before today and I have to say I
am really really impressed I really love
how this look turned out obviously I
only speak on the colors I used because
I haven't used all of them but the ones
I used blended really nicely I didn't
have any issues with them honestly when
it comes to eyeshadows
I don't really care how they swatch
unless they SWAT or ibly as long as they
perform well on the eyes so I really
didn't want to form an opinion until I
started to play around with this palette
but a lot of you guys were asking me
what I think about it and so far so good
I can't wait to play around with this
palette even more congratulations
jacqueline this palette is really
beautiful and I know you worked really
really hard on it so yeah guys I don't
want this interest to be so long if you
want to see how to get this blue purpley
cuz the blue kinda looks probably
reddish kind of smoky eyes then just
keep watching
okay I'm going to try my best to get
through this voiceover because I feel
like Pope right now but we're going to
do it so I'm just priming my eyelids
with some concealer as usual and now I'm
going to take the Jacqueline Hill
palette and I'm going to take this shade
and on a fluffy crease brush I am just
going to buff this into my crease I'm
really putting this color on my entire
crease I'm not being precise with this
or anything I just want it all up is
there and then I'm going to take this
color right here I know all of these
shades have names that I have no idea
where I put a little paper insert so I'm
just going to point and Vesey so I am
buffing this color in my crease as well
but I'm being a little bit more precise
with this one and not blowing it out so
much and then I'm going to take this
delicious blue color and I'm going to
pack this on my entire lid alright so I
really love how this like a reddish
color looks against the blue so I am
packing this color into my crease I'm
actually putting a lot of this color
down because I want to see the contrast
of the blue and the red so I'm applying
a lot of it and then slowly diffusing it
into my crease kind of like dragging it
up and making it a little bit more smoky
and faded then I'm going to take this
darker right in the palette and I'm
going to use this kind of like the
sandwich color in between the blue and
the red just so that everything blends
nicely and there are no harsh lines
I'm going to go back into the blue and
intensify it of course because when you
apply a bunch of other eyeshadows on top
it will lose its intensity so I'm just
packing that color again and same goes
with this red shade and just attend
intensifying it a little bit more okay
back into that crease color I use I am
just using this to diffuse any harsh
lines right up in there and then I
decided to go with this color versus the
black because this one as well it was a
little more purpley so I'm using this to
deepen out the outer corners and make it
you know fill true your deeper bulkier
sexier you know
Javier's porters okay so the palette
doesn't really have a matte brow bone
highlight so I took the balm nude beach
palette and I dipped it into the shade
brilliant just to highlight my brow bone
without a shimmery color but then I
thought and needed a shimmery color so I
went in with the first shade in the
palette but I didn't want to apply too
much because as you can see my brows are
Wolfen and I don't want to bring too
much attention to them I took a brush
with no additional products and I just
blended out my crease some more and now
let's move on to the face this is the
touch and sole no poor blend primer it's
supposed to help with your pores and I
love it so much and then I took the
hourglass vanish Foundation stick and
then mixing two shades because this one
is a little bit too pale for me but then
this one is a little bit too dark for me
so I like mixing both of them and then
I'm just buffing it in with my a
cosmetics love is the foundation brush
and I love this foundation it's like one
of my favorites I don't use it on camera
that often but it really is one of the
best and now for concealer I'm just
going to take my usual Tarte shape tape
this is in the shade light neutral I am
just buffing that underneath my eyes to
cover up my dark circles and then to set
that down I took the new Kat Von D
blotting powder in the shade light and
I'm using that just has that like I said
this is darken up my under eyes just a
little bit but I just love this powder
so much I use it to set my under eyes I
use it on my entire face it's just
amazing it's like a fully grilled
product for me now I love it so much so
I just set all the places I put down
sealer to finish up the eyes I just took
this shade again and I pop that in my
inner corner this color is very very
beautiful and Lalit and then I just took
the em cosmetics new black eyeliner it
is amazing it took me forever to take it
off which is a good thing so I applied
this to my tight line in my waterline as
well and then I took I forgot to show
you a little clip but I took the first
shade we ever used in the crease and I'm
using this to apply to my lower lash
line and I'm pretty much going to just
use all the colors I used in my crease
originally on my lower lash line so I
took this shade again and on a different
pencil brush I just smudge this on my
lower lash line as well and I'm going to
be repeating this step with all the
other shade
with this darker color I'm only going to
focus this on the outer corners of my
lower lashline just so that they can
match my lid color as well because I
only have it on the outer corners of my
lid
my stomach hurts so bad right now you
have no idea all right let's keep it
moving
oh I also applied some more eyeliner to
my waterline just to intensify it a bit
and then off-camera I applied some
mascara and some falsies and then that
completes the eyes to finish up the face
I'm going to contour my skin I'm going
to take the oath I wanted to take my
hoops off because they were driving me
bananas and then I forgot to put them
back on but anyway I took the contour
blush by NARS in the shade Thalia and I
use that to just carve out the
cheekbones a bit and a little bit on my
forehead and then I decided to bronze
the skin with my Too Faced Sweethearts
bronzer in sweet pea or sweet tea I
think it's sweet pea yes and I'm sweet
tea none of those would be three and
then I'm just using this to bronze my
skin I love this bronzer it's one of my
top 5 bronzers it's just so shimmery but
not orange not too shimmery it's perfect
LOV and then I took the Charlotte
Tilbury blush in the shade first love
and I just pop this on my cheeks
I picked this blush because I didn't
want anything I was going to clash with
my eye makeup since it's pretty colorful
so this one's really natural and just
goes with everything and then I busted
out a highlight I haven't used in a long
long time this is Mac give me snow
organicide give me gun this is Mac soft
and gentle and I just applied this to
the tops of my cheekbones and a little
bit on my nose to highlight and then for
my lip color I took the NARS Velvet
gloss lip pencil in the shade bueno
Cyrus and I really really love this I
just picked this up from Sephora and
it's such a pretty glossy nude but yeah
