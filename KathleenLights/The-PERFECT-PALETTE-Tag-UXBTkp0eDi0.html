a tag video and this is a video attack
video that I've been wanting to do since
I saw it and it is the perfect palette
tag normally I would be filming this
right in front of my window um but it's
7:35 at night and there's no Sun so I'm
filming with my light bulbs by the way
isn't my shirt so cute pug life I love
it I love it I don't own a pug but I am
jealous of all the people in the world
who do anyway if you're wondering what's
that pillow and that air mattress doing
there that's strange
um we have friends visiting from Miami
so this is the guest bedroom so this is
where they're sleeping anyway I'm gonna
go ahead and get started with the tag
I'm sure you guys have seen this tag
before but it's basically the perfect
palette tag I'm just going to talk about
pallets there are eight questions and
the first question is best packaging my
computers right here and I'm reading
them off my computer anyway this is
going to shock a lot of people but um I
think the best packaging goes to the Too
Faced palette and I know that like
everyone hates the Too Faced packaging
which I totally understand they are a
little bulky is what people complain
about but I just think they're so pretty
like I don't know you could just like
stand them up next to each other and
they look like many little books I don't
know
and I just love how they open up like
this and and they close like this and
there are tiny little fat boxes I don't
know
maybe it is a bunch of wasted space for
9.i shadows but I like them number two
is best color payoff and this goes
hands-down to any Urban Decay palette
ever Urban Decay eyeshadows are my
absolute favorite eyeshadows of all time
they're better than Mac to me personally
I love Urban Decay eyeshadow so any
palette made by Urban Decay is going to
give me the best color payoff in my
opinion I just love them this is just
the Naked 3 palette so sitting right
here so all of my
Gate pallets have the best color payoff
number three is most versatile and this
one is so cheating and you're gonna hate
me for it but it's my matte palette I
got mine online um you can get them at
the pro store as well but I just love it
because you can customize your own
palette
you could fit 10 no 15 not 10 you could
fit 15 Mac eyeshadows and you could even
fit like elf eyeshadows in here makeup
geek eyeshadows in here any eyeshadow
the size of a Mac one they fit in here
and to me personally this is the most
versatile because you can put whatever
you want in these palettes and yes it is
more expensive buying this and then
buying each individual eyeshadow I think
the pans at Mac are like 11 or $12 for
the pans but you'll never get a color in
this palette that you hate because you
customize it yourself sometimes I'll buy
a palette and I love a bunch of the
eggshells in the palette but there would
be like three or four that I don't like
in the palette and then I never end up
using those eyeshadows and that's a
waste to me
I don't know so you'll never go wrong
with customizing your own so it's I mean
this is the most versatile number four
is best for travel and that is my little
baby Urban Decay Naked basics palette
this is the ideal traveling palette in
my opinion
look at the size first off this is like
the tiniest little palette this will fit
anywhere this this fits in your pocket
guys and that's just amazing for travel
if you have like a lot of luggage or you
have a suitcase full of a lot of stuff
it's not that easy to just stuff a giant
pallet in your suitcase but this little
thing will fit anywhere and also you
know that none of your eye shows will
get damaged because it is really sturdy
packaging like it it's good packaging
and it closes shut it isn't like a
magnetic thing like this where am i open
in your suitcase you can actually do a
lot of looks with the eyeshadows in this
palette the majority of these colors are
matte the only one that isn't is this
first one but I don't know it's to me
you can do a lot with this palette
number five is biggest regret and that
unfortunately goes to my smashbox
softbox
i bought this a few months ago actually
remember when I bought it but um I just
I not that the eyeshadows aren't
beautiful because they really are it
comes with a matte brown a nice matte
like cream color am i a matte gray and
then three shimmers but I just wasn't
impressed surprisingly the shadows with
the most color payoff in this palette
are the matte ones but I was just really
disappointed in these three eyeshadows
right here they just didn't have the
color payoff I expected them to have for
being Smashbox so it was kind of bummed
about that and so the only colors are
really using this palette or the three
matte ones and you know so I mean I
probably shouldn't have bought it kind
of regret it number six is best color
names and you guys are going to think
I'm weird when I tell you which palette
of mine has the best color names in my
opinion the bottom of the best color
names goes to the lorac Pro palette and
I know you're thinking no it does are
you serious but yes I am this palette
has the funniest names and to me when I
think of like a palette with the best
color names I think of color names that
make me laugh and the names of these
colors are white cream taupe light pink
mauve nude gold black deep purple like
really long lorac couldn't get just a
little bit more creative with the names
of these colors I think I'm the only one
in the history of the world who like
laughed hysterically when I opened this
palette for the first time and I saw
what these were called I just I find
that hilarious it's like oh I'm gonna
use a white eyeshadow I wonder what it's
called it's called white let me use
black it's called black I'm a weirdo I
know I'm really weird and sometimes I
need to tone it down okay people are
watching
number seven is least used and that has
to go to my Sigma creme de Couture
palette and not because I don't like it
because I absolutely love this palette
like I love it it's just the colors
oranges wearable for day to day as any
other palette I own
I'm pretty sure I'm going to use this
palette a lot in the summer because I
want to try and experiment with my crazy
colors in the summer but just now for
this time of year I don't use this and I
bought this palette in like a release in
the fall so of course I didn't use as
much as I would like to I did reach for
these four colors right here cuz they're
like warm nice colors but the rest of
them I just I haven't really touched all
that much and then the last one number
eight is most used most loved desert
island this is like your most favorite
palette of all time like if you were
stranded on a desert island or if you
were going to a desert island which
palette would you take with you your
absolute favorite and I bet you guys can
already guess and that is my Urban Decay
Naked palette my original Naked palette
and I was so happy to see that this was
a lot of people's choice for this
question and with good reason
I mean God pooped and this came out was
that was that inappropriate this is I
mean that's the color of poop that's why
I said it this is the most beautiful
palette I own hand found all of the
colors in this palette are so rich and
pigmented and like chocolatey and I love
it
it has like nice light colors it has
like all these rich beautiful bronzy
gold z types of colors and then it has
like a little bit of a pinky a little
bit of a purple and like your darker
gunmetal and blackish kind of color I
don't know this this palette is perfect
it has everything I could possibly need
honestly I could have said this palette
for every single question besides Lise
used and biggest regret doesn't it look
like a chocolate bar no I think this
will forever be my favorite palette when
I hit pan on every single one of these
eyeshadows I will buy the palette again
I just ah I don't know what I would do
without this pal not that I need this
fellow to survive because makeup isn't
everything but you know what I mean I
love this palette okay so that is the
