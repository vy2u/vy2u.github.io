little bit different I'm actually gonna
be filming the pet tag I didn't think I
would ever film this video but I'm
actually surprised at how many people
have been requesting it for months now I
mean for a long time now and I was
googling like the questions on the pet
tag and they're kind of just like silly
questions like what's your pet's name
what breed where did you get your pet
all this stuff and I guess I'll just go
into that myself I will be personalizing
my own pet tag but this is the meet my
pets tag I was actually gonna film
something completely different today I
was ready to film a makeup tutorial
but the didn't end up happening it's
actually a pretty sad day today I know a
lot of people don't know but the pitcher
liked the best pitcher for the Marlins
and one of the best pitchers like ever
right now passed away last night Jose
Fernandez he was my age he was only 24
and he died in a boat crash in Miami
last night him and two other people my
thoughts and my prayers are to their
families it must be so so hard I know
Jose Fernandez actually was about to
have a child like his girlfriend was
pregnant he was so good I actually was
at the Marlins Park um the very last day
he pitched not knowing it was gonna be
the last day he pitched but since I was
like such a fan of him and so was Danny
I was like a little bit shocking so
we're a little bit down in the dumps
today and I thought that maybe filming
the pet tag would kind of get my mind
off things and I don't know I just
didn't want to do a makeup video today I
didn't want to sit down and put on
makeup I just did it so please excuse
the target in between my eyebrows I know
you guys have been staring at that since
the beginning of this video you guys
know I've been having some skin issues
lately and this is just really irritated
and red but I didn't want to put
foundation or concealer over it because
I didn't want to aggravate it even more
so all I did honestly I just have a
little bit of concealer underneath my
eyes so did my eyebrows and put on
lipstick and put on mascara I really
don't have any face makeup except the
concealer on my eyes cuz my bags my
circles they were intense
I just wanted tabatha here to breathe a
little bit I don't want her to be
suffocated with makeup so I hope you
guys don't mind Tabitha
hang out with us in this video okay so
let's just get started this video is
gonna be so dumb and pointless like who
wants to stare at my dog so I'm gonna go
in order of oldest to youngest I have
three dogs by the way that is what this
video is gonna be about my three dogs
first up here is Cornelius first of all
actually I want to say I haven't based
my dogs in a hot minute they look a
little greasy like look at this Porter
and Cornelius little low greasy if I had
dog dry shampoo Cornelius would be
bathing in it right now but I I don't
have a dog dry shampoo I don't even know
if they make dog dry shampoo so this is
Cornelius he's my oldest dog he is eight
years old his birthday is June 18th
shout-out to any of you guys who share
Cornelius his birthday and I can't
believe he's eight how I got Cornelius
was actually not the best after being an
adult I mean I purchased Cornelius when
I was 16 so I didn't really know
anything about the Humane Society and I
nobody taught me any of that so I had
begged my parents his breath is not the
best I don't know what it is about old
Yorkies but their breath is just like
and everyone says he's a Yorkie and I
just I just call him a Yorkie but he's
such he's so big he's like a lot bigger
than a lot of your keys I've seen a lot
of vets have actually told me that he's
a silky terrier which is kind of like a
family member of the Yorkie but they're
actually silkies so he is technically a
silky terrier okay but you can't fall
asleep in the middle of your
introduction what's happening to this
old man if you guys have been following
my channel for a while you guys are used
to Cornelius I mean he was with me when
I started my channel I've had him for
eight years he always used to sit on my
desk and he just doesn't like doing that
anymore he's like over it this is his
favorite thing to do these days it's
just like sleep so I got him when I was
16 and I really wish I mean I don't
regret it obviously but I would really
recommend just going to the Humane
Society and finding your dogs because
the hey my society is full of like super
nice dogs like a lot of them are really
really nice sometimes you'll just be
walking around and you won't notice but
you'll have a connection with one of the
dogs and it's nice so before you go buy
at a pet shop I would recommend going to
the Humane Society first but I didn't
really know anything about that and
unfortunately
like I bought Cornelius at a pet shop it
was actually funny because when I went I
walked in and I was like I'm looking for
Yorkie and Cornelius was like sitting in
a little play area with his brother and
I did not like Cornelius I liked his
brother like physically like when I
walked into the pet store
I thought his brother was the cutest
thing I had ever seen and I kind of made
my mind up I was like perfect him I want
him right now and when the guy took the
dog out like for me to play with him or
you know just to kind of see his
personality the dog did nothing he just
sat there he was like just sitting there
like no emotion like he was happy but he
was just like sitting there I was like
okay can I see the other dog and as soon
as I put her knees on the floor he was
like Jim Jim Jim - he was running back
and forth he was jumping on me he was
licking my entire face I was like
perfect I'll take him and I'm so glad I
did like every time I look at Cornelius
I'm like I almost took your brother can
you imagine and we've been buddies ever
since hello it's not your turn he
actually was a super cute dog okay in
his prime when he was younger he had the
face of a stallion look how sleepy he is
and actually on my way home from picking
up cretinous I was like what should I
name him what's her name and then it
just hit me my favorite movie growing up
when I was a child was Thumbelina Oh
cake Rene's has done he's like I'm done
my favorite movie growing up as a child
was always Thumbelina I loved Thumbelina
and the prince in the movie is Prince
Cornelius so on my ride home it just hit
me I was like Cornelius a perfect name
so I had Cornelius for six years before
we decided to have another dog like me
and Danny I was like you know what okay
I think it's time to give Cornelius a
friend you know he's already 6 I think
it's time he hangs out with someone so
he went down to the Humane Society when
I was living in Mississippi we got to
like this little kennel and it was
saline which is so funny cuz it was
Selina and her brother and then there
was a group of like five other dogs from
a different breed and there was this
white dog that as soon as I got there I
was like oh my God look at this dog he
was so cute he was like spotty and I
loved him I thought he was beautiful and
I gave the papers to like the woman at
the Humane Society
no you can't leave you can't I don't
know this happened but anyway she
grabbed the paper so she's like okay
I'll be with you and
second I'll go put this in the system or
whatever it is that they do then we went
back to go see like the white dog to
like hang out with him a little bit and
then I see Celine in a little corner
getting humped by all of the boy dogs
like all of the boy dogs just humping
her and she's just like in a corner
looking so sad and like please please
take me so we ended up changing our
minds and we took Celine she just looked
so sad like the white dog was having the
time of his life with his buddies and
like Celine was just in a corner like
scared scared shitless and it's been
love ever since um she was probably the
cutest puppy I've ever seen in my entire
life okay she was so fuzzy and delicious
a lot of people ask me all the time what
breed she is and I honestly have no
freaking idea the lady of the Humane
Society said to me that she was a mixed
woman she's a mix obviously but the lady
said that she was a mix between a German
Shepherd an Australian Shepherd and then
a Labrador like what I don't know how
much of that is true or much of that is
false but I don't know she's not like
German Shepherd sighs you know what I
mean like she may be an Australian
Shepherd I'm not sure so we brought
Celine into our lives and it was an
adjustment for Canadians I mean he loved
her right away cuz Grey Gnaeus loves
dogs but he was not prepared so I was a
little bit of an adjustment and Celine
as a little bit of a bully yes little
bully yes you are
so she like roughs him up but she loves
him she loves him Cornelius and her
super-competitive though like when we
take them outside they're the ones
running after each other and chasing
each other and like fighting over the
ball like they are so competitive but
she's so sweet
and I actually wanted to name her hazel
like that was supposed to be her name
but Danny was like ed you named
Cornelius millet so Danny named turn and
he actually thought of the name because
of the movie underworld he has an
obsession with that movie with Kate
Beckinsale underworld and you know it's
a vampire movies actually a great movie
I love it but Kate Beckinsale's
character her name is Celine the vampire
so that is what we named her from
everybody asks me if we named her after
Celine Dion but no although one hopes to
India her name really is Savage that is
a nickname I have for her
that is exactly what she is I actually
have liked you I don't know if you can
tell in this video but my lip is busted
a little bit here and it's a little bit
swollen yesterday she was just doing
something with her hand and bah busted
my lip so she's my Mississippi girl she
is the best thing that I brought from
Mississippi in him so and it just makes
me so happy too this is like my souvenir
from Mississippi Celine's best friend in
the entire world is actually Porter
she loves Cornelius but Porter is the
love of her life Porter Porter come here
hey come on Porter does not listen to
anybody by the way he does what he wants
pata come here
here come here come here it's like not
wanting to anything today what is wrong
with you though this is Porter this is
my Gracie my Gracie look upon a boy and
and it was quite why he was wrong
darling wake up though Porter
unfortunately is not a rescue let me
give you a little bit of a back story of
what happened so Porter and Selene both
came into our lives like a month apart
so we went from having one dog for many
years to having three I call it once um
honestly it was my fault I take full
responsibility I should have known
better but my dad has a Yorkie named TV
TV is everything to my dad she is so
beautiful and one day when Danny was on
deployment every time Danny would go on
deployment I would go back to Miami we
lived in Mississippi like I said but I
would go back to Miami and then I would
stay with my dad with Cornelius like I
would stay there the full six months or
eight months or nine months however long
Teddy's deployment was and TV is not
fixed and at the time Cornelius wasn't
either labels should have been fixed at
the time I just never got around to
doing it but one day I'm just in my
dad's house and I'm like listening to my
iPod and Cornelius and TV were like in
another room and all of a sudden I hear
like weird things like I hear like just
like weird weird noises coming from the
other room and when I run in there
they're like connected and I was just
like calming them down because they seem
to be really irritated now as I calm
down calm down and then when they like
disconnected my dad was there and he was
like oh no oh my gosh oh my gosh I was
like what watching he's like oh my gosh
oh my gosh is that she's she's pregnant
she's getting
it I can't believe this I can leave this
I had no idea TB was on her period I had
no idea she was in heat so a few months
later homeboy popped out she actually
gave birth to a couple of dogs my mom
kept his sister I don't know I just I
kept one I kept one and that is Porter
so Porter is corny nieces love child I
would say Porter is the worst thing and
the best thing that has ever happened to
me
I have a different relationship with
Porter than I do with Cornelius than I
do with Celine I can't really explain it
but I've never had a dog loved me the
way that Porter loves me and I've had
dogs my entire life he doesn't let me do
anything without him if I accidentally
lock him out of the room or something
he's like sobbing on the other end of
the door he feels the need to be with me
24/7 like it that is his job is to be
with me so we kind of have separation
anxiety when we're not with each other
I don't favor my dogs I don't favor one
over the other like I love them all the
same but me and Porter have a different
relationship it's just it's a weird bond
it's weird it's I've never felt this way
with any dog it's weird
I came up with the name Porter Danny
loves to pretend it was his idea but it
was 100% my idea and it was inspired by
Jack Porter from revenge I was mean
Danny both of us we were obsessed with
revenge when it was on TV and my
favorite character was Jack Porter I
loved him so much so that's where the
name came from Oh a lot of people ask me
about Celine like why I call her weenie
that is her nickname because I don't
know since she was a puppy she was like
my Cellini weenie little Shalini weeny
so we just kept calling her weenie
that's my wings she actually really
defends Porter if Cornelius and Porter
are fighting which happens a lot
Cornelius doesn't really like Porter all
that much and every time for an a is
important are fighting Celine goes and
like gets Cornelius like hey don't mess
play the only bad thing about Selena's
she sheds like a mother
oh and Selena and Porter are both two
years old Selena's birthday is May 21st
and Porter's birthday is August 21st
which is kind of funny yeah I think I'm
done with this
I introduced my dogs to you guys and
told you why I named them what I named
them and how there aren't is it really
anything else to this tag I don't know I
would get a cat Cornelius loves cats but
then Porter hates everyone danya are the
only people who he lets touch him who he
lets go near him like he growls at
everyone Porter is not friendly
whatsoever Selina and Cornelius they
love people they're friendly Porter I
don't know I don't know what it is and
he actually doesn't go and try to bite
people he's just like a like in a corner
growling and shaking like terrified I
don't know I don't know how to fix that
do you guys have any recommendations
like how do I fix that
okay I'm gonna finish I'm done this
video was so dumb I'm sorry I've had a
really really anxious week I don't know
it's just not my week and I I don't I
don't know I just haven't been myself I
