things so many emotions it's such an
important video to me and I'm both sad
and excited it's so weird but as you
guys know October is Breast Cancer
Awareness Month and breast cancer is
something that's very common a lot of
people suffer from it and as I'm sure a
lot of you know breast cancer runs in my
family on my mother's side but on both
of her sides like through her father's
side and through her mother's side my
grandmother sister had a breast cancer
in Cuba but thankfully they got it in
time they gave her treatments you know
she she survived it and then my
grandmother also had breast cancer but
unfortunately she did not catch it in
time and she passed away in 2014 due to
that and it was really really hard on my
mom on my family on all of us it was
just it was really sad because my
grandmother had it for a while and she
just never even knew I mean she didn't
really get herself checked often which
is a really sad thing she was actually
really afraid of the hospital and really
afraid to get breast cancer in general
she was actually terrified of it and
unfortunately her fear ultimately led
her to just it was too late and there
really wasn't anything we could do and
she died four months later like we found
out she had breast cancer and four
months later she was gone and ever since
then I just I go to the gynecologist all
the time I'm always checking myself I'm
always making sure my sister and my mom
just people in my family in general just
check themselves all the time it is so
important because you just never know
you can feel absolutely fine and you
just never know so it's so important
even if breast cancer does not run in
your family please guys always check
yourself you can google ways to check
like for lumps in your boobs I mean talk
to your gynecologist do what you can but
definitely check yourself always and
when I launched kale polish I just knew
that when October rolled around I really
wanted to do something oh my god I'm not
gonna cry I said I was
I'm gonna cry really all I wanted to do
something as a tribute to my grandma I
wanted to dedicate a nail polish to her
and show her if she's looking down on us
I just wanted to show her that you know
I'm doing what I can to help the cause
and that I'm always thinking about her
so I created this shade and that is what
I'm sharing with you guys today I wanted
to create a shade dedicated to Breast
Cancer Awareness Month
I'm so excited to finally be talking
about this polish because we actually
shop for this when I was in California a
couple of months ago I don't know if you
guys follow the KO polish Instagram and
keep up with the Instagram stories but
the same week I was there shooting the
Fall collection I was shooting this
color and there were a few people who
noticed the polka dot caps because we
had like a black and white like photo in
the Instagram stories and you guys a few
of you noticed the polka dot caps and
you guys were wondering what it was for
and this is what it's for it's finally
here and I think it's so cute
I think the cap is so cute the cap has
little pink polka dots all throughout it
the cap is still soft touch but it's
white with the little polka dots and the
shade is such a pretty pink I know that
breast cancer awareness month is all
about the pink which I love it's like a
little bit deeper than pepto-bismol I'm
actually wearing it on my nails right
now if you haven't noticed and this
color looks so amazing on it like every
single skin tone I've had a lot of
people in my family a lot of my friends
try out this color and it just looks
good on everyone I love it I named it
mummy Metta which is the name of my
grandma her name is Magda but growing up
I always called my two grandmother's
mommy Mantha and mommy Yolanda like we
had the name mommy in front of their
name I don't know it just it was just a
thing and mommy in Spanish means mom so
it's like mom Martha
but it's mommy it's different when it's
in Spanish so it's mommy mad duck and I
honestly couldn't think of a better name
for this nail polish and the absolute
best best best part about purchasing
this nail polish is that a hundred
percent of the profit goes to be CR F
which is the Breast Cancer Research
Foundation they are an independent
nonprofit organization and it was really
really important for me to find a really
good place to donate to and I just love
what they represent so if you buy this
nail polish not only do you get really
pretty color that is long wearing good
formula you get to help donate to an
amazing cause that's trying to prevent
breast cancer and just help find a cure
in general I have a video going up on
the kale polish YouTube channel this
Friday that goes into a little bit more
detail about be CRF and why I chose it
but heel polish will be donating all the
profit we get from selling this nail
polish to be CRF and I'm just I'm I
don't know me know how to feel right now
I feel so many different emotions if
you've always wanted to try out Kol
polish I would say this is the nail
polish to buy because you're really
really helping ain't great cause and
it's so important to do our research
just in general and I know a lot of
people think that breast cancer only
affects like older women but it does not
it can affect young people too I know a
lot of you guys know I spoke about this
in a random rambles video I have
fibrocystic breast disease which sounds
really really terrible but it's not
cancerous it's just like your boobs are
very very lumpy they're like full of
little lumpy balls you can't see them
from the outside but when you like grab
your boobs and like feel up on them mine
are very bumpy when in that time of the
month rolls around it's like even
bumpier and they can get so painful and
really uncomfortable when it's not that
time of the month you know they do go
down a bit you could still feel like the
bumps but it's not terrible and because
of that I do get kind of like those
little ultrasound things like once a
year and during one of my ultrasounds it
came back that I had like a little tumor
in my boob I had to get a biopsy done to
check if it was cancerous and thankfully
it wasn't but I was freaking out the
entire time and just getting the biopsy
done was so nerve-racking for me I can't
even imagine somebody going through the
process of actually having breast cancer
and it's just it's awful all cancer is
so awful but you know I was scared and I
thought I had something and I'm 25 so
you just never know especially if it
runs in your family so I know I said
this already but definitely just check
yourself just be on top of it so
yeah that is the story I wanted to share
with you guys today
I really wanted to launch a nail polish
in October in memory of mommy Mantha and
I hope you guys enjoyed this nail polish
I hope you check it out I know it was
like a really surprise launch and out of
the blue but you know it's October we
launched it so it is currently available
I will have the kale polish website link
down below so you can check it out this
is a limited edition shade though by the
way I completely forgot sand in the
beginning of video this is a limited
edition shade all my shades have been
permanent except a suspensive but this
one is also limited edition we will
continue to sell it in the month of
October as long as it's available but
once they sell out they sold out so
definitely get your hands on this while
you can and help a good cause it would
mean so much to me and I just want to
thank you guys from the bottom of my
heart for making this possible
you are the best subscribers in the
world and just thank you thank you for
making this happen I just I can't stop
looking at it I'm just like looking at
the name and just it's so sad like I
wonder what my might that would say
about it you know like I wonder how she
would feel about it yeah losing people
will never be easy for me which actually
I really want to say something really
quick before in this video about Vegas
with what happened in Vegas I am so
sorry about what's happening in the
world
Vegas was like my happy place I've been
there three times I love Vegas I think
it's like one of the most amazing places
in the world I've always felt so
carefree when I've been there it's just
a very happy place for me like I you
know the show is just everything is so
magical the lights are beautiful and it
sucks that these attacks are happening
and I just hope for a change I hope
something gets done I'm just so sorry if
you guys were affected by the shooting
if anybody if any of your loved ones
were affected by the shooting I'm just
so incredibly sorry and my heart goes
out to you and I pray for your peace and
they pray for all of us every day that
passes it's like we're more more afraid
to live it's devastating but that said I
just I love you guys so much thank you

video I hope you check out this nail
polish if you or anyone in your
