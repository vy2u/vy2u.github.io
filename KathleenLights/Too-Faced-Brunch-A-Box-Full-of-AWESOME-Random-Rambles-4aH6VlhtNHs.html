morning at least for me it is it is 7:00
a.m. I'm actually have to start getting
ready for an event which I'm super
shocked about because events don't
happen in Miami ever I mean they kind of
do sometimes I went to a naked heat
event with Urban Decay in Miami like a
few months ago but today I'm going to a
two-faced brunch like to face is having
a brunch here and I think it's - I'm
pretty sure when I saw the invitation
that's what it looked like I'm pretty
sure it's to celebrate the launch of
like the new nude collection or like the
new naturally nude collection I'm not
exactly positive what it's called but
I've seen pictures on the internet and
it looks so beautiful from the moment I
saw it I was like oh my gosh that is
gorgeous I love it like with Too Faced
last launch that unicorn stuff that
unicorn crap I just was not a fan of it
and I think they know that I was not a
fan because I needed to be they didn't
send me a collection and I always get PR
from them I didn't get the unicorn
collection I was like smart two-faced
but I did buy the festival refresh on my
own because this looks so cool this is
like I said am I gonna use it today what
I just want to show you that I got that
I'm really excited for this because the
collection looks so beautiful and I
don't know if you've been following me
for a while but like the natural eyes
and the natural matte palette used to do
my favorite back in the day I think
they're kind of like rebranding
everything I'm literally wearing my tank
top over this shirt I'm gonna wear to
brunch because I know I put this shirt
on once I already have a full face of
makeup on because I'm scared to like
dirty my white shirt I'm especially
excited for this event for three reasons
one of them a me so I don't have to
travel to this is hosted by Nicole
Guerrero she is one of my favorite
youtubers she's one of the first people
I ever started watching and I've never
ever ever met her and I like her so much
I love her videos she seems so dr.
everything cool but the third reason is
actually a funny one I gotta take some
Jesse you know you know my friend Jesse
Jesse smiles here on YouTube
why am i drinking a berry at 7:00 in the
morning I got a text from Jesse and
she's like hey are you going on this and
she sent me the invitation and then I
was like wait a minute what is that and
I looked through all my emails so they
have like 40,000 emails in my email I
know it's really bad but I specifically
looked for it and I found it and I got
really really really
I was like heck yeah I'm gonna go let's
go so I'm going with Jessie which makes
me feel a lot better because usually I
go to these events with Danny and I
mingle with Danny because I'm not like a
social butterfly
I'm just so awkward in those events I
don't know why but he's actually going
to my dad's house today because right
that has this like wooden roof situation
that he has over the pond and we've had
that thing over the pond for like the
last 15 years so it's like literally
falling apart especially after a
hurricane and stuff so Danny is
replacing that today and he couldn't
come I mean a two-faced brunch but I
actually don't know if any guys are
going to this so I just want to fill you
in on those details I'm gonna go ahead
and finish it up my makeup because I
feel like if I sit here and talk to you
guys I'm never gonna leave and this
brunch is I need eleven and I know that
seems crazy cuz it's oh my god it's
already 741 I know it's crazy to second
raise early but I gotta go to Jesse's
house first you know she has a baby so
it's a situation and then she lives like
an hour away from the beach it's a
situation so I'm gonna do something very
two-faced see I'm gonna do like 20
colors on the face I want it to be like
nude and pinky and girly so that's what
I'm gonna do for my makeup I'm gonna
play some Billie Holiday and get to it
okay so we just left the to face rot in
jail though oh my god Oh broken oh dang
meat and it was really really nice it
was really pretty without side and they
got they gave up these really cute
little new natural collection Oh
oh my gosh I'm so sorry and I'm pretty
sure they're just like rebranding their
natural natural collection because it is
so pretty let me show so pretty these
are the bronzers and these are the new
eyeshadow palette II way to help your
Jessie thank you I do seamlessly
beautiful new collection
oh my god may stop talking like that
this is like the blush and highlight
palette so beautiful here are some of
the swatches of the highlights are so
pretty I'm not sure if you can tell look
at the aunt hello Amanda don't you the
lipsticks have cocoa butter and they're
vanilla scented which is awesome so
we're just sitting here waiting for our
uber now which I think you should be
here like right now and they were just
gonna go to Jesse's house and probably
eat some bagels eat some bagels oh hey
guys yeah sorry we just jumped a few
days is now Sunday 47 p.m. and I have to
edit this video and post it tomorrow
morning but I quickly wanted to come on
here because I know that what you just
saw was a hot mess and it was so dumb
and it was kind of quite a nice even
film that because I kind of felt like a
little bit too awkward to film at the
brunch like I don't know I tried but I
guess I'm just not comfortable with that
amount of lager and like holding my
camera up and
even though everybody there kind of does
the same thing I just felt so strange so
I didn't really blog much I'm gonna try
to get better at that I really am gonna
try to build up my confidence with that
but I like that it was really nice I had
a great time I always have a great time
with Jessie Nicole is so sweet I mean I
didn't really get a chance to talk to
her all that much I didn't even know
that Carli bybel was gonna go to this
brunch I was so pleasantly surprised I
loved chronic white boy I've been
watching her for a long time too and I
never met her before and they were super
sweet I just never really get a chance
to talk too much I mean we took a photo
it was awesome it was just like a really
quick small brunch something really
intimate but it was really nice before I
sign off on this video I actually wanted
to talk to you about a couple things
first
in my last random rambles video I spoke
about the Marc Jacobs Daisy Twinkle
perfume I'm loving that but oh my gosh
okay so I just purchased this in the
mail the other day I know a lot of
people hate perfumes stuff but I'm
freakin addicted to perfumes I don't
know what it is love bottles like
perfume bottles and then scents like
they know what it is I have like a weird
obsession with perfumes but you guys
already knew that but anyway I saw that
Chloe came out with a new perfume and
it's called no maid I don't know if I'm
saying that right no mad no maid and I
bought it without trying it on the
sephora website just because the reviews
were really really good but I don't like
any of the other clearly perfumes so
same thing with the Marc Jacobs thing
when I got it in the mail I know I say
this all the time but I was instantly
taken right back to my childhood in my
house like smelling my mom before going
to bed my mom used to wear well she
still does Calvin Klein and eternity
like that is her signature perfume not
even know anybody else who wears that
cooking but its percent and growing up
she used to wear that and like lather
her body and creams and you know all
this stuff and then go to bed and this
to me immediately when I smelled it
smells like my mom like lathered up in
creams with a little bit of Calvin Klein
eternity mixed in there I don't know I
know that sounds so strange but it's
such a beautiful scent I loved it so
much immediately when I smelled it that
I'm gonna go buy the full size I know
that's crazy I absolutely perfumes but
I'm a collector at this point and I love
it and the scent is gorgeous I would say
go smell it cuz I think it's really
really pretty I wanted to show you guys

picture on Instagram and a lot of you

a video and I think I just might I'm
