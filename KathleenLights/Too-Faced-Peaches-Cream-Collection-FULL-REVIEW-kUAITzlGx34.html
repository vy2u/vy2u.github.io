an entire review on the two-faced
peaches and cream collection they have a
ton of stuff in this collection and I
asked you guys in my last video if you
wanted to see a full in-depth review on
everything because I have been trying
out all of these products for a few days
now and I pretty much have my mind made
up on how I feel about this collection
there are a lot of things to say so I
just want to get started I did receive
the entire collection from Too Faced the
only thing I'm missing is the mattifying
primer which I don't know if they didn't
send it to me or if I lost it because I
I have never seen it in my possession
like I don't know what happened there so
I don't have that and they also sent
three of their lipsticks and then I
ended up purchasing one myself they sent
me more nude shades and I really wanted
to try out like one of their intense
peach colors so I purchased this one and
I just I have a lot of opinions so let's
just let's just get started all right
let's start with the palette because
this is what I was most excited for when
I heard about this collection because
honestly I just haven't been blown away
by the color selection and some of the
new Too Faced palettes like they came
out with a white chocolate bar palette
and the colors just looks so I don't
know not my favorite I just their recent
palettes the color selection is so weird
I feel like the colors don't go but when
I saw this one this is called the Just
Peachy mattes palette and by the way
everything in this collection is infused
with peach and sweet fake cream which i
think is delicious but when I saw this
palette I was like okay and this is
definitely a palette I can get on board
with it just has all the matte
eyeshadows I would ever need because
even though this one isn't a black it's
almost a black so I was so stoked for
this and it did not let me down I really
like this palette I find that they're
really easy to blend they're really easy
to build on top of each other I love the
looks I've created with this palette I'm
wearing it on my eyes today you can get
a really deep smokey eye with this or
you can get like the most natural look
ever it's the kind of palette that would
be perfect to pair with like an all
shimmer palette but even then I've used
this like three or four times and I
didn't need to dip into another palette
obviously it's an all matte palette so
you're gonna get an all matte look but I
love it if you're
into warm peachy tones I don't see you
liking this because the shades pool very
warm you can get a bunch of different
looks with this but they're all gonna be
looks that pool pretty warm so just keep
that in mind I love warm eyeshadows
they're so flattering and I really like
this palette I love the mirror I just I
feel like this is one of the standout
products from the collection I've never
had an issue with to face eye shadows
they've always worked for me the
chocolate bar palette is one of my
favorite palettes of all time I know my
friend Rob beauty Christy if you don't
follow her on YouTube she's really
really great if you should totally check
her out I know that she kind of had like
an irritation with this palette I think
the peach scent kind of irritated her
eyes she said that they were pretty
itchy while she was using this I haven't
had any issues with that but if you are
really sensitive to scents and your
eyeshadows you might not like this
the entire collection smells of peaches
and cream it's crazy I personally love
the scent i I mean I have my peach
candle on I am obsessed with peach and
the collection smells very peachy but
it's different than the sweet peach
palette like this one smells like this
one smells like artificial like fake
peach I like it
I like it but it smells like a more fake
peach scent this one however the peaches
and cream collection those sentence way
better on this one it smells like real
peaches but it does have like that sweet
fig creamy vibe to it like to me this
does smell like peaches and cream I
don't know I personally cannot get
enough alright so let's talk about
something I did not love and that is
these things the these things these
things these are the new melted powders
this one is a melted powder blush this
one is a highlight and then this one is
a bronzer they all have the same type of
formula these are kind of like cream to
powder finishes like when you first put
your finger in it's very creamy it's
like definitely like 100 percent of
cream and then when you go to blend it
out on the skin it does like transform
into a powder it's so weird and at first
I was like wow that is so cool but the
more I played around with them the more
I just did not like them this highlight
has so little color payoff when you
apply it to the skin
like I can't even describe this formula
it's this highlight is like not even a
highlight it doesn't show up on the skin
I really just don't understand this one
this is probably the worst one out of
the three of them it just it doesn't
highlight the face not only that it's
just really patchy I find that to be the
issue with this formula and same goes
for the blush this one was a little bit
better I was able to get a nice
application with it but I just don't
reach for blushes like this and the
whole process it's just a little bit
more time-consuming than a regular blush
it's not as patchy as the others but I
just I just could not get this these to
work for me at all so I don't like this
and then I also I don't love the bronzer
I thought I really was gonna love this
one
just because swatched it looks so nice
but this looks so patchy on the skin
maybe I'm doing something wrong but
every time I try to use this it just
doesn't look seamless it doesn't look
smooth it looks muddy every single time
just does not work for me
and it sucks because when you blend it
out the color is really beautiful it has
a very very slight golden sheen to it it
just looks so bronzy and warm and JLo II
but it just it did not apply that way to
patchy for me I have so many bronzers
that work way better than this I do not
think this is worth the money at all
alright moving onto something I really
love I think this is my favorite thing
in the entire collection and that is the
Too Faced peach perfect comfort matte
foundation this is so good
it's oil-free fourteen-hour we're oil
controlling and photo friendly I don't
know about the 14-hour wear thing I have
worn this all day and I haven't noticed
it fading really quickly or anything but
I don't know if it will last like 14
hours like put to the test you know I
haven't really tried that I don't I
don't leave my house ever so but it does
wear really nicely it's also infused
with peach and sweet fake cream which is
kind of cool I mean all of this stuff is
and while you're applying this to your
skin
you smell the peach you really get a
whiff of this scent when you're applying
this foundation so again keep that in
mind if you are sensitive to scents or
if you hate the smell of peach it's the
foundation I'm wearing on my skin right
now it has really great coverage medium
toufool you can build it up so well and
it doesn't get cakey I've done like two
to three layers of this foundation and
it looks great it looks good around my
nose and in between my eyebrows it
doesn't get thick or cakey which is
weird considering it's a
Comfort mat but honestly I don't see
this as a mat foundation I would
consider this a nice satin finish it's
like the perfect in-between foundation
because it's not dewy but it to me it's
not matte it's like the perfect natural
finish it does photograph really well I
mean it has a pump I love squeezy
bottles I have nothing negative to say
about this foundation honestly all right
back to something that I didn't know
this is the peach blur it's they're
translucent smoothing finishing powder
and I hate this actually I'm sorry I
don't like to use that word I don't hate
it I just really don't like this I just
don't see how this would work for anyone
it's a translucent smoothing finishing
powder but it's peach like like it's a
peach powder and the first time I use
this I applied way too much on my skin
it gave my skin like a CH tint like all
around my face so the second time I used
it I used a lot less I just tested this
on the face but I found it did nothing I
don't get this powder at all in order
for me not to see this I have to use
very little and then I feel like it
doesn't really do its job it just is the
strangest powder I don't like it it's a
powder that I just don't get okay moving
on to something I do get and I really
like this is the sweetie pie radiant
matte bronzer and I love it at first I
thought I wasn't gonna like this at all
because it has these little pink squares
in it and usually like these mosaic
type powders I'm just not a huge fan of
but I really like this I find that this
is kind of like a two-in-one
I mean it's definitely a bronzer don't
get me wrong but the tone of this is so
nice it has a very very slight sheen to
it so it gives your skin a nice healthy
glow but then it's not too bronzy it's
not too warm either and today I kind of
used it as a bronzer blush kind of thing
because I wanted like a really nude
bronzy blush and I find that this works
for that as well you could just bring
this onto the cheeks and it gives your
face a nice bronzy glow without looking
like you use the bronzer as a blush does
that make sense I love it it's a really
nice product so something that I didn't
like just because I have very very dry
skin it just didn't work for my skin
type this is the peach perfect
mattifying loose setting powder I love
the scent of the
it's the same sense as everything but
because it's a loose powder it just
smells even more like it's just I smell
that more this is a very nice powder I
could just imagine people with oily skin
really loving this because it does
mattify the skin really well I wouldn't
call this an invisible powder but I
wouldn't call it a very thick and cakey
powder either it just didn't work for me
because when I applied it to the skin
under the eyes it looked fine but around
my nose it looked really like crusty and
in between my eyebrows it looked like it
was just the combo of my dry skin and
then this on top it kind of made the
foundation look cakey but I have an
extremely dry t-zone as it is so adding
this on top just made matters worse but
it does what it's supposed to do it's a
mattifying powder and maybe if you have
oily skin you will really really love
this but if you are very dry like me I
would say far away from these I mean I
don't know everybody's skin is different
but I just didn't work for me personally
okay let's talk about these lipsticks I
have a few thoughts I have a few
thoughts first let's talk about this
packaging because it is absolutely
gorgeous I love that you have the color
on the cap so even when these are closed
you know what color you're getting and
you don't have to just remember like
based on the name on the bottom oh and
even in the bottom like this thicker
anyway I really love this packaging it
is beautiful it feels extremely
luxurious the lipstick has peaches like
engraved all over it so fancy I love it
I love this packaging 100% do I think it
looks extremely similar to the tachi
lipsticks yes this is a tatcha lipstick
this is much much heavier you can tell
just by holding it that this is just
like pricier more expensive but this is
a touch of lipstick and this is a
two-faced one it has the same way
packaging it has the same little little
thingy right here it says Tasha across
here this one says two-faced across here
and then the top is a gold like Tasha
symbol and this one has this so the
packaging is very very very similar
besides the packaging I feel like I have
a love-hate relationship with these
lipsticks if you know me if you have
been a watcher of my channel you know
that I love matte lips more than
anything and I can usually take any
matte lipstick like
it has to be bone-dry to be drying for
me but some of these some of these are
too drying some of these are perfect
it's like this lipstick I'm wearing
right now it's called Sunday Funday it's
my favorite one out of all of them it's
so delicious it's so comfortable for me
and these are cause they're peach kiss
moisture matte long-wear lipsticks now
when you think moisture matte you think
it's gonna be a matte lip that's very
very hydrating but I don't find that to
be the case for all of them this one is
like that and so is this one insects on
the peach but I went out and purchased
this one because I really loved this
color this one is called everything is
peachy oh my goood oh man this is so
drying I can't even apply this to my
lips it looks awful it's very neon and
sometimes neon lipsticks can pull very
drying and they look cracky and weird on
the lips and that is definitely the case
with this one this is not moisturizing
don't love this shade I love the color
so much so I'm gonna see if I can make
it work with maybe like a lip balm
underneath and like something else I
don't know but it is very very dry and I
also find that doll face is a little bit
drying as well not as bad as this one
but this one is a bit drying so I don't
love those but see the one I'm wearing
is the one I've been wearing the most
Sunday Funday it's so comfortable it's
creamy to me I can rub my lips together
and it's and I didn't wear a lip balm
underneath like I really really love
this one so I'm afraid that throughout
the line you're gonna get some hits and
misses some lip sticks are gonna be
great and some lips are gonna be just
like way too drying a couple these I
love and a couple of these I don't so I
don't know how to feel right now but
Sunday Funday this one's really really
good I hate to leave this video off on a
sour note but my last product I want to
talk about is the peach mist mattifying
setting spray I don't like this at all
I will say the first time I use that I
used it completely wrong I didn't shake
it you have to shake this setting spray
I know you have to shake most setting
sprays but I have a bunch that I don't
shake up and I just use them and it's
perfect but this one you really really
really have to shake it up because if
you don't you will create a hot mess
just like I created the first time I had
just finished doing my entire makeup it
looked great amazing and then I sprayed
this all over my face and when I
in the mirror I was horrified I had
little peachy like it was definitely a
peach tint like peachy white dots all
over my face it ruined my eyeshadow like
it took off my eyeshadow it was so weird
all that peachy white stuff was like all
over my face and then it kind of got
hard and matte and then it stayed there
and there was no fixing it the second
time I used it I made sure I used it
right shook the crap out of it and then
I used it that way and there wasn't any
peachy polka dot problem but it's so
it's matte somehow define miss I mean
obviously what was I expecting I have
very dry skin but I wanted to test it
out because I have a few matte setting
sprays I don't hate but this one made my
skin feel really tight hey guys so I
just wanted to tell you really quick I
actually wanted to give the peach mist
one last try before filming this video
so I applied it to my face after I did
my entire makeup this day well liked
this video and I don't know if you can
tell but it's on my right cheek there's
that tiny little white dot on my right
cheek yeah that caused it
I even shook it up shook it up real good
and it still got me I got one little dot
on my face it's been driving me crazy
the entire time I've been editing this
video but yes I just I guess I just
don't like this when I apply a Miss at
the end of my makeup I use it for two
reasons I use it to melt down all the
powders on my face to make my highlight
look like my skin and I also use them to
prolong my makeup this one I'm sure
makes your makeup last longer since it
feels so tight and it feels like it's
locking it in but I don't like how my
skin looks after I use this it just
looks matte it doesn't look like my skin
is healthy it just makes my skin look
worse I don't need mattifying I don't
need mattifying at all but maybe those
of you with oily skin will really really
love this if you have really dry skin I
would say don't even try it don't even
try it so yeah guys that completes this
video these are my thoughts on the
peaches and cream collection I'm pretty
sure it's just exclusive to Sephora so
check it out next time you're in Sephora
I would say the two major hits in the
collection are these two I just freaking
love these so yeah let me know what you
guys think have you tried any of these
products out leave your
thoughts down below I love hearing your
reviews as well but thank you guys so
