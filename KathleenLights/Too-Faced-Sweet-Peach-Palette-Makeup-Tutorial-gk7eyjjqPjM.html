a makeup tutorial on this look it is
using the Too Faced sweet peach palette
it's been so highly requested to do my
favorite look with this palette and this
is pretty much it it's very similar to
the look I did in my no mirror makeup
challenge it obviously much better
because I had a mirror and I really
really loved it very warm and summery
and fresh so if you want to see how to
get this look then let's just you know
get started so I've already primed my
eyes and I've applied some eyeshadow to
set down that primer and I'm going to go
straight into the sweet pshhh ballot and
the first color but I take is giorgia
it's a really pretty peachy pink color
and I'm taking this on a fluffy blending
brush applying this into my crease I'm
using this color as my transition shade
so all the colors can kind of blend
seamlessly I'm sorry this is like out of
focus here but I'm taking the brown
shade in the palette this is called
puree it's a very very warm peachy
orange II Brown I love it so I'm just
packing this on the outer corners and
dragging it into my crease I'm going to
take the shadow luscious well I like to
call it lunches so I'm taking the
largest color and I'm applying this on
my entire lid using a flat shader brush
I want this color everywhere like I want
it all to be shimmery and then I'm going
to take summer young and I'm going to
buff that on the outer corners and drag
that into my crease as well the same
thing I did with puree only adding a
little bit more depth and warmth then I
took a brush that was a little bit more
dense this one is from Coastal Scents
it's just like a flat shader brush and
I'm packing that summer young color on
the outer corners and then slowly
dragging it into the crease I wanted a
more precise brush to apply more product
and then I just took Georgia to blend
all that out to highlight underneath my
brow bone and I just took the white
shade in the palette my eyebrows are on
fire I need to get them done and then I
just took luscious again and applied
some more just in case some of it got
blended away and now I'm mixing luscious
with the white shade and I'm applying
that in my inner corners okay so
starting on my face I'm taking the NYX
Born to glow illuminating primer and
then I'm going in with my Shiseido
synchros skin found
I'm applying the foundation with my pure
sponge I have been loving this
foundation it gives you really good
coverage and it just looks really nice
on the skin like it lasts a long time
I'm totally into it loving it so I'm
just applying that on my entire face I'm
speeding through this part because
you've seen it a million times now I'm
taking my lasting perfection concealer
by the brand collection I got this
concealer on Amazon I've gotten a lot of
questions where I got it I got it on
Amazon because I'm pretty sure we cannot
get this in the States
so I found it on Amazon and I'm just
blending that in with my sponge once
again now I'm going to set down that
concealer I'm using my NYC smooth skin
translucent loose powder and I'm just
going to set my under eye concealer with
this this is actually a really great
powder
it doesn't look powdery on my dry skin
and it was insanely affordable pretty
good I'm gonna say pretty pretty good so
I'm gonna finish off my eyes I'm going
to take my NYX brown eyeliner my toes
Yoli eyeliner in brown and I'm going to
tighten line and add that to my
waterline as well then I'm going to take
summer young and on a pencil brush I'm
just gonna buff that on my lower lash
line and then this is the part where it
got really frustrating for some reason I
could not do a wing today like oh my
gosh I'm using the ardency in punker
eyeliner in black and okay yeah I'm
totally out of the frame here this is
usually what ends up happening when I
try to do some liquid liner I don't
notice I'm out of the frame I was so
frustrated because it didn't turn out so
good
but I took my Jordana best lash extreme
applied that to my lashes and then I
went in with some Ardell falsies these
are these soft touch falsies and then
that completes the eyes had a little bit
trouble trouble I had a little bit of
trouble with that wing but we survived
so now I'm going in with this NARS duo
it's the hot sand and Laguna duo so I'm
just taking the Laguna bronzer on this
Mac brush it's like a flat paddle brush
and I'm kind of contouring and bronzing
the skin at the same time this bronzer
can do both I feel like it can contour
but bronze you up very well I
really really love this bronzer so I'm
just bronzing up the skin now I'm going
in with blush this is the Too Faced
sweetheart blush in the shade is
sparkling Bellini I'm kind of focusing
my brush on the top two shades not so
much like the dark pink and I'm just
popping that on Zee cheeks it gives you
a really pretty Orange II pinkie glow
and for highlight I'm just gonna take
the hot sand highlight that's in this
duo I'm applying this with my morphe m31
0 brush it's a nice little fan brush and
then I apply some setting spray this is
the Wet n Wild setting spray and I have
popped it on my entire face and then
went in with my highlight again just to
intensify it doing this little trick
really does intensify your highlight
it's amazing and then I went in with a
different brush to highlight my nose I
don't know why I don't know but I did so
yes and to finish off the look I'm going
in with my lip color this is fancy by
color pop but I didn't want something so
intense I wanted like a milky version of
a coral so I just blended that out with
my finger and then I went in with this
Tarte lip gloss in the shade hella and
just put that on top and blended that in
and I really liked how it looked it's
like a glossy pinky coral but it's a
little bit more natural and that
completes this look thank you guys so
