my top 10 favorite drugstore makeup
products are so many things I absolutely
love from the drugstore makeup related I
talked about everything I loved this
video would be 78 hours long so these
are the things that I need in my
collection at all times at all times and
this video is a special one because it
is a collab with Amelia lianna here on
YouTube she lives in London and she is
so perfect and I love hearing her talk
and she's so beautiful and she has the
best accent in the world and this is the
worst worst worst imitation of a British
accent but I'm just trying to speak like
her but it's impossible what was that I
cannot do this accent let me stop she
lives in London and she has beautiful
hair and there's something about her
videos that it's very very soothing
she's very classic like she has a very
classic look and I just really love her
channel so once you're done watching
this video make sure to go check out her
top ten drugstore makeup products and I
think this video is going to be
beneficial to a lot of people because we
are both in two completely different
countries so certain things that she can
get in the UK I can't get here so it's
going to be cool to see which products
she mentions so I might link her channel
and her video down below so make sure
you go and subscribe because I just
absolutely love her videos and her voice
okay okay so if you watch my channel
this is going to be no surprise - but my
first product is or are the maybelline
fitme concealer
these are my all-time favorite drugstore
concealers in the entire world I love
these because you can use them
underneath your eyes and on blemishes as
well they do crease a little bit so you
have to set them with a powder if you're
going to use them underneath your eyes
but they have enough coverage and
they're super creamy and hydrating I
have really dry skin so I need something
that isn't going to dry up my skin and
these don't dry them up but they also
work on top of blemishes as well because
the coverage is pretty decent I love
them and
they're not expensive at all and they're
really comparable to the NARS radiant
creamy concealer I actually have the
NARS creamy concealer and I rarely use
this because I think these are just as
good and there's so much cheaper than
this okay so I have just started getting
into blushes so much more than I used to
I used to hate blush but now I kind of
like it I kind of love it to be honest
and the best blushes I've ever found at
the drugstore are the Milani baked blush
is specifically
luminoso I think out of all the blushes
I own this is definitely top three out
of all of them because it is so gorgeous
it is a peach color but it has a little
bit of a sheen to it and it just makes
your skin look like it is glowing it's
the blush that I'm wearing on my cheeks
right now I didn't put too much but it
is beautiful it's perfect for the spring
and summer it's not spring or summer now
but I put it on for the sake of this
video but I use it a lot in the
summertime and it's very very pigmented
because it is a baked product I highly
recommend this blush even over high-end
blushes I recommend this blush it's
amazing all of the baked blushes I
highly recommend them so the next
product is the Jordana best lash extreme
I get my Jordana products at Walgreens
and I think they also sell Jordana at
Kmart but I haven't seen them anywhere
else this is the best mascara ever I
used to hate it like I'm talking about
like hey it was in a product I regret
buying video I hated it but I just
realized I wasn't using it correctly I
used to pack on the mascara like layer
after layer after layer after layer but
this mascara just needs two thin coats
and you have amazing lashes if you're
into lengthening lashes then I wouldn't
go for this if you like that ba-ba-boom
volume then yes pick this up it's a
$2.00 mascara it's a lot cheaper than a
lot of drugstore mascaras and it is so
good it's so good okay so I love
drugstore foundations very rarely do i
branch out and get high-end foundations
I do have a couple of high-end ones but
the majority of my foundation collection
is drug
I just think though they have a lot of
really good ones at the drugstore but
the one that I found is the absolute
best and all the ones I've tried is the
Revlon Colorstay I get the one for
normal to dry skin they have one for
oily skin but I personally think this
one is the best - all jacked up this is
my summer shade I love it this is 250
fresh beige it's the perfect undertone I
continue to repurchase this color
because it just looks good with a
self-tan it gives such a beautiful
finish it's like a natural satin a
little bit matte but it's more of like a
natural finish and it lasts forever I
wear this in the daytime and then it'll
last all through the night
it does have SPF 15 but I don't find
that it looks terrible in flash
photography
I do recommend setting this with a
powder but once you do it's perfection
and the best part is is that it is full
coverage but doesn't feel heavy okay so
this next product is actually really new
to me I just included it in my October
favorites video but I want to talk about
it because of the formula this is the
Jane cosmetics bronzer I have mine in
the shade inspire this one is great for
fair skin but they have like 5 different
colors 5 or 4 different colors but I
want to mention it because it's the best
formula I have found at the drugstore
like foundations where I love drugstore
foundations I must sucker for high-end
bronzer but this Jain bronzer is great
the formula it's so easy to blend will
never make your skin look dirty because
it just blends effortlessly it's like a
full-proof bronzer and these bronzers
are very very pigmented and they smell
like absolutely nothing if that matters
to you they don't have a weird set it's
just an overall amazing bronzer doesn't
feel like drugstore it feels like luxury
high-end and I get Jane cosmetics at
Ulta ok so if you watch my channel this
also will come to no surprise to you and
this is my favorite eyeliner ever ever
high and low and ever it is the
Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
Midnight master this is the black one it
is black as night it is dark and I love
it I like it
so because it is a retractable eyeliner
it's not a pencil eyeliner I don't need
to sharpen it and I prefer these because
I have very sensitive water lines and if
I put anything harsh on my waterline I
will just start crying and it just hurts
and I'm not a fan so that's why this
eyeliner is perfect for me because it is
very very creamy but I find it still
stays on my waterline it doesn't smudge
everywhere it doesn't like get too
slippery where it's like down your face
by the end of the day it stays put but
it's creamy so it glides on easily it's
okay so this one is a little bit random
but I love it so much and the day I run
out of this I will go run out and buy it
it is the Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick
in stormy pink this is my favorite
drugstore lipstick ever which is weird
because I rarely use it in my videos but
when I worked at the next I wore it
every single day to work this is the
perfect pink because it's not too dark
it's not too bright it's not nude by any
means it's like very much pink like kind
of like the pink you see in the tube but
it applies a little bit softer I love
the Revlon Super Lustrous lipsticks
because they don't have a scent and they
just are really really comfortable on my
lips they're one of my favorite
lipsticks from the drugstore
besides my wet and wild and my Milani
ones they're just really good and this
color is so beautiful I've heard people
say that it is a dupe for Mac's pink
niveau pink no boo I don't know how to
say that one I don't know because I
don't have that lipstick but I love it
okay so this next product is so holy
grail so holy grail it like burns in my
chest when I talk about it and it is the
Physicians a formula shimmer strip in
the shade Miami strip this is my
favorite highlighter ever I don't have a
lot of highlighters I am a highlighter
junkie and this is my favorite
highlighter in the history of life it's
the highlighter I'm wearing on my cheeks
right now can you see it oh look at that
glow Jennifer Lopez in a little strip
Jennifer Lopez in a strip I love
everything about it
Physicians Formula is one of those
brands that I rarely go for at the
drugstore because it isn't
little bit on the pricier side of the
drugstore but this is definitely worth
the money I paid for it I love it
because you could just swirl your brush
around and all the colors and then apply
it that way or you can just use it in
different sections and have a bunch of
different colors if you're a little bit
deeper in skin tone all you have to do
is use these and if you're a little bit
more fair all you have to do is use
these on this side so this is the kind
of a strip that will work for like every
skin tone honestly okay so my next
product is a liquid eyeliner and it is
from NYC it is they're just regular
basic liquid eyeliner my packaging has
like rubbed off the letters so I'm not
exactly sure where this is called
instead I think it's just NYC liquid
eyeliner if I have mine in black I don't
know if it comes in a bunch of different
shades but this is the best liquid
eyeliner ever like when it comes to a
brush tip it's amazing amazing amazing
it dries super super matte I love a very
matte eyeliner look I don't like the
whole black glossy look I like it very
matte it dries so matte it's really easy
to do a wing this is the eyeliner I have
on my eyes right now the only thing I
don't like is that it can get a little
messy because it's so pigmented and like
inky that make sense
inky so the link e so sometimes it'll
come on my eyelashes but it is user
friendly it's easy to use and it's so
easy to do that little flick and for
just a couple dollars I can look past
that little issue okay so I have two
more things to share with you
technically the one I'm about to share
with you is number 10 but I have an
honorable mention that I want to talk
about so my last product technically are
the Maybelline Color tattoos these
things are incredible they are the best
cream eyeshadows I have ever come across
at the drugstore they're even better to
me than Mac Paint Pots there might be a
lot of Mac Paint Pots but I will always
choose these over Mac Paint Pots because
there's so much cheaper so I don't find
the point the only thing is that I wish
they would come out with like a dupe for
Mac soft ochre and a dupe for Mac
painterly paint-pot
they have come out with matte cream
shades before but they're limited
edition and then they just take them
away from us but these two are my
favorite ones this one is bad to the
bronze and it's just that a beautiful
bronze color but it has a lot of taupe
eNOS to it so it's like a very topi
bronze color and then this one is
pomegranate Punk and it's a beautiful
cranberry purple with a golden undertone
this one is just a little bit patchy on
the lids so you have to kind of work
with it in layers but once you do it's
beautiful this one in bed to the bronze
is so creamy and goes on so easily that
you can just wear it alone or underneath
eyes shadows you can wear all of them
alone or underneath eyes shadows as a
base they don't crease
they prime your eyelids and they last
all day I cannot recommend these enough
okay and so my honorable mention are the
elf brushes because I think they're
great brushes at the drugstore
specifically these two don't get me
wrong there's some elf brushes that to
me suck like completely suck but the
majority the studio line really has
worked for me and I love these two the
most I love them just as much as my
high-end brushes this is the elf
complexion brush and this is the elf
small tapered brush I love this for
setting my under eye concealers
beautiful I love it and it's also a
great highlighting brush and then this
one is great for bronzer because it kind
of it's a paddle kind of brush so it's
nice to do like a very soft contour and
just like bronze your whole face with it
