my top 10 favorite lipsticks to wear in
the fall although I do love my bright
neon Pink's there is just something I
love about dark vampy lips they're just
my favorite colors to wear because you
can literally put on just a very bold
lip add some mascara and you look like
completely done I just love it
anyway I'm going to be showing you ten
lipsticks four of them are MAC lipsticks
and the other six are from the drugstore
so those are very affordable really
quickly though I want to say keep in
mind that lipsticks look different on
everyone a lipstick that looks a certain
way on me might not look that way on you
because everybody has different skin
tones and stuff like that so just keep
that in mind but anyway let's get into
it
the first one I'm going to be talking
about is from the drugstore it is a wet
and wild megalast lipstick I did a whole
video dedicated to these lipsticks I'll
link that down below if you're
interested this one is called buried all
and it is a brownie nude kind of color
it looks more Brown on my lips someone
who has a darker skin tone than me it
probably won't look as brown on you than
it does on me it's because I'm pretty
fair that it looks so Brown but I love
that I really think it's an amazing
color for fall because it's so Brown I
probably wouldn't wear this in the
summertime but it does look really nice
paired with a bunch of different eye
looks and I think that a lot of
different skin tones this would look
beautiful on you and the best part is
that they're like a dollar ninety-nine
and you can get them at the drugstore so
you can't beat that
this next one technically isn't a
lipstick it is the Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stain and this is in the
color honey I love the kissable balm
stains they're my favorite jumbo crayon
type of things but this one is so
beautiful for fall I would wear this
year-round just because I love mommy
colors but it is perfect for this time
of year it goes on super smooth and
glossy and it's just really effortless
this is literally the perfect everyday
color for the Fall I definitely
recommend this color to those of you who
aren't really comfortable wearing the
Manvi lip but you want to stray away
from the Pink's that you wear in the
summer you know like the basic Pink's
you know if you're tired of that kind of
thing this is definitely something I
would look at if you're interested in
that kind of color and these apply so
easily that you really don't need a
mirror you just swipe swipe swipe and
you're done and they're stained so you
do know that you're gonna have that
color on for the entire day this next
one is a MAC lipstick and it is called
taupe and it is kind of similar to bear
it only it's a lot darker it's a little
bit more red it kind of reminds me of a
brick it has like that brick enos kind
of color if that makes any sense at all
this lipstick will look really pretty no
matter what skin tone you have because
my friend is pretty tan and this just
looks like her lips but better kind of
lipstick it looked really nice on her so
I really love this lipstick especially
for the Fall last year I wore it all the
time I got my sister to buy it
it's just that lipstick that I just I
need for the Fall I just I love it so
much this next one is also a MAC
lipstick and it's one that I never hear
anyone talking about it is called fresh
Moroccan and it is a frost formula by
the way the taupe one that I spoke about
five seconds ago it is matte so if
you're wondering okay back to this
lipstick it is a frost formula which is
really scary to a lot of people because
it's like shimmery and that's not
something that a lot of people are
interested in but this specific lipstick
is gorgeous the first time I tried this
on I fell in love with it it is a deep
red with gold shimmer to it and I know
that that seems scary but it is really
pretty on the lips and the gold shimmer
just makes it look really glossy and
it's so like festive I really love it I
love wearing this color around
Thanksgiving I just really like it
because you never see lipsticks like
that it is really different and unique
which is what I like by the way I will
warn you these lip swatches start to
look a little sloppy towards the end of
the video because I didn't use a lip
liner with any of them because I wanted
to show you the lipstick true to its
color so you know I just put it on
without lip liners so you know you know
how that goes sometimes
forgive me but anyway moving on
this next one is a Milani lipstick it is
their color statement lipsticks and this
one is an uptown mauve this is the
prettiest purpley fuchsia color I've
spoken about these lipsticks hundreds of
times they smell like watermelon Jolly
Ranchers they smell heavenly they're
super creamy super opaque the formula is
to die for I love them the only way I
could really describe this lipstick is
fuchsia it is a beautiful berry pink
this is really pretty for the daytime as
well you can just put this on put on
some mascara and it'll look really
really nice I definitely recommend
checking out this line especially for
the fall they have beautiful dark colors
they have one called black cherry and
sangria those are beautiful colors so
definitely check out this line for fall
lipsticks they have nice ones the next
one is probably my favorite one out of
all 10 of them it is the one while my
glass lipstick in sugarplum fairy this
color is actually pretty much an exact
dupe for max rebel lipstick so if you've
been wanting to get your hands on rebel
but didn't want to spend like 16 dollars
for it then definitely check out
sugarplum fairy from the Wet n Wild my
last collection this color is just so
vibrant and rich it looks beautiful on
absolutely everyone I've seen the
darkest skin tones rock this lipstick
amazingly it looks so nice on everyone
it's awesome this next one is from Mac
and it is called diva it is a matte
formula and I'm sure you guys have heard
of this lipstick multiple times it's
very popular this is just your basic
vampy red lip if you're looking for a
very very dark red lipstick this is the
one I would recommend it's matte so it
doesn't bleed or you know you don't have
to worry about the messiness of a glossy
dark lip it's matte so it's perfect I
will always continue to repurchase this
because this is just honestly perfect
for fall that's all I have to say about
it it is the perfect red vampy lip and I
love it so much this next one is also
from Mac and by the way I know these
lipsticks are starting to look really
similar on my lips but they are really
different they are I don't know how to
explain
there's they're different okay they are
this one is called dark side and this
one I will admit is really similar to
Deva only there's more burgundy to this
there's like a hint of like a plum enos
to this lipstick I don't know how to
explain it and it's an amplified cream
so it is glossy I just wanted to mention
this one because I know a lot of people
don't like matte lipsticks because
they're drawing or whatnot so this would
be a really good choice and I love that
there's like a burgundy Ness to it I'm
actually really surprised that I love
this so much because I'm not into
amplified creams if they're so dark
because you can get bleeding or whatever
but I was willing to make an exception
for this lipstick because I love it this
next one is another megalast lipstick
can you tell I like these
can you tell and right off the bat I'm
going to say this lipstick is scary it
is not for everyone okay it really isn't
this is a straight up dark purple like
you look like a vampire when you have
this on like Fran about diba you look
like a vampire when you have this
lipstick on but I still think it's
really nice because it's not black like
it doesn't have a black tint to it like
if you're familiar with Mac's cyber that
is a really really dark purple almost
looks black I can't even pull that off
if you can pull off cyber
congratulations girl that's hard but
this is a deep purple without taking it
too far
I don't know how to explain it it looks
really nice on a lot of people if you
are daring if you're a bold definitely
check out this lipstick it's so
different to me I don't have any
lipstick that looks like this and I
every time I put it on I'm like wow this
is intense but but it's cool it's like
very I don't know I think of like
high-fashion when I put it on I feel
like I'm about to go pose for Vogue it's
it's nice it's intense okay and the last
lip product I want to talk about isn't
actually a lipstick it is a lip liner
this is georgeanna's lip liner in
Cabernet you can get Jordana products at
Walgreens this was literally a dollar
ninety-nine I'm sure I think it was
about 99 it wasn't it wasn't more than
three dollars I know that I love this
lip liner so much because it is so
incredibly smooth and creamy
it is not drawing in the least bit I
actually wear this as a lipstick on its
own which is why I wanted to include
this in this video the fact that you can
actually just put this on fill in your
lips and it looks like a beautiful
lipstick is amazing because a lot of lip
liners aren't like that it's so smooth
and really comfortable to wear I swear
I'm going to go back and get a bunch of
these lip liners but this is actually
the perfect lip product for fall because
there is a huge trend this season which
is a very wine colored lip where the
center of your lips looks like you have
just been drinking wine and it's like
feathered out and it looks just it looks
like you've been drinking wine basically
and that is a huge trend this season and
this lip liner achieves that this is
actually the color on my lips right now
only I topped it off with NYX soft matte
lip cream in addis ababa these two
combined is what gave me this it's
really nice and matte I don't know I
really like how this turned out if you
were wondering what was on my lips
definitely check out this lip liner
because it does look beautiful under a
bunch of different lipsticks especially
your dark lipsticks obviously okay guys
so that was it that was my top ten
favorite fall lip products thank you so
much for watching guys please subscribe

you in my next video fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
