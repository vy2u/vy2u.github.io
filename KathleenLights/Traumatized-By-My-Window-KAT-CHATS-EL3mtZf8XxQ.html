na my coffee another episode of cat
chats I haven't done a cat chats video
in a while this is my cat chats corner I
spoke about it in my last cap chats
video if you guys have been watching my
videos for a long time cat chats is just
basically I sit here and I just talked
about crap my last cat chats video I was
showing you guys pictures of me growing
up and I got really requested to do a
part two to that so leave me a comment
down below letting me know if you guys
want to see it part 2 - like reacting to
old photos um I did mention in my last
cat chess video that my next one would
be like on positivity and on how to stay
happy and how well how I stay happy like
things that I do in my life to stay
happy and just a positive video but I
don't know if that would be too boring
or if anybody would be interested in
that so that is the second question I
have for you today is that a potential
cat Reds video you would like to see
something like that unlike happiness and
stuff leave me a comment down below but
like I was saying earlier today is like
a spin off ish even though it's not that
makes no sense one of my cat chats
videos from way before I told you guys
stories i titled it story time and I
told you guys like little itty bitty
stories of like my childhood and things
that happened to me in high school and
little things like that that's kind of
what I'm doing today only I'm telling
you one story Porter if you knock down
my light mmm oh hello first I'll be the
little face or look at that little face
today's video I'm just telling you one
story so today we will talk about this
story and actually this is not a funny
story if you were here just tip to laugh
you're probably not gonna laugh it's not
a funny story it's just the weirdest
thing ever it's like this random crap
that happened to me and my cousin in my
life
and we cannot live it down like if we
talk about it all the time it's
something that we'll never let go so now
that I have the longest intro ever let's
get into the story you're probably
wondering why I titled this that okay so
I was about like 17 years old when this
happened and the main person in this
story besides me
my cousin Jeanine I have spoken about
Jeanine many times in cat cats videos we
were together 24/7 growing up so a lot
of the things that happens to me in
Jeanine was a part of I had a very
strict father I still kind of do but I
have a very very strict father I wasn't
allowed to do anything I was like in
captivity all the time my friends used
to make fun of me I've told you guys
this before but they used to call my
house the force field that know that I
wasn't allowed to leave in people would
come over my dad loved it when my
friends came over but he didn't like it
when I left so I was in the force field
a lot so one day Jeanine is at my house
again I'm 17 she is 19 18 or 19
we're like a year at a few months apart
and my parents are home and my dad is
like hey me and your mom are gonna go
out and we're gonna be out all day so
stay here do not go anywhere do not open
the door 21 just don't move I don't know
if June had her car yet but I'm pretty
sure she didn't so we stayed in my house
my dad was like do not open the door to
anyone like he made it very clear that I
was not allowed to leave that house me
or Janine so we were like yeah yeah okay
yeah so my parents left they were gone
for like a few hours and Jeanine and I
got like really really hungry and there
was nothing in my house like we had no
food and we were like crap we are
starving so Janine is like okay just
order pizza right let's just order pizza
and I was like that's great except my
dad doesn't let me open the door through
anybody so how are we gonna order pizza
so it became like this big joke man
Jenni we're laughing like oh you know it
would be great if we ordered pizza and
we told the guy to come to my window
because if we get the pizza through the
window technically I'm not opening the
door to a stranger so we thought that
was a brilliant idea we thought it was
the funniest thing ever and we were like
yeah let's do it let's order pizza and
tell the guy to come to the window so I
had a window in my room very similar to
this but it was really high off the
ground like for some reason it was at
like the top of my ceiling like my
window was really little but high up on
my wall really weird so my bed was
underneath it so like I had my bed here
and then my window was here
Sonique oncea my bed was right here and
window
okay so my mom I don't know if this is
like a Hispanic thing but all of my
windows had screens on them like if we
were prisoners like screens I know it so
that you could open the window and the
mosquitoes don't come in because there
are million mosquitoes in South Florida
like they eat you alive so we all had
screened in Windows so I opened my
window right I lifted up scoop stood I
don't know that was and I'm like oh crap
Janine I have a screen on my window I
completely forgot how are we gonna get
the pizza if there's a screen on my
window so I'm like oh don't worry I got
this covered I'll just push the screen
out no big deal so I'm trying to push
the screen Janine is sitting on my bed
watching me do this and I'm pushing the
screen and I'm pushing the screen and
this screen is stuck so I'm like uh-huh
we need to push this screen out in order
to get this pizza so Janine is like
helping me push the screen we're trying
to get it and I was gonna like push it
out and then grab it and bring it into
my room and then when the pizza arrives
get the pizza and then take the screen
out and put it right back in but that
didn't happen
so as I'm trying to fix this screen like
it finally pops out and then falls to
the ground and I'm like oh sheesh so the
screen is now on the ground this this
story actually sounds so crazy and when
I get to the end you'll understand why
nobody believed us so the screen fell to
the floor and Jains like just go outside
go through the front door and get the
screen it's not a big deal right so I'm
like fine so I go outside and this is
what my house looked like this is the
front door and my room was on the side
of the house like right here so I go to
the front door what I'm making my way
downtown well okay just kidding I'm
making my way around the house to grab
the screen and put a give it to Janine
through the window and as I'm walking
out of the door I notice these two guys
come to my house in a car sometimes
they're pulling up to my house I
immediately recognize them and one of
the guys was actually somebody I was
seeing or not seeing but I was I was
talking to somebody I was like sort of
dating but since I wasn't really allowed
to date I wasn't really dating you know
I mean those kind of
to him but not really and it was his
friend it was him and his friend so this
person was out of their mind by the way
this guy was like crazy very spontaneous
like insane so he pulls up to my house
and I freaked out because my parents
aren't home
why freak out because he comes he's at
my house which is really weird but he
pulls up to my house and I walk outside
of the door and instead of turning
around cuz you know I'm impulsive and
I'm super crazy so instead of walking
out a door seeing them pull up and run
back inside the house and close the door
and go to GT like freaking out
I decide to run to the window like I go
outside I see them pull out and then I
just run to the side of the window like
where my room is to pick up the screen
so when I get to this story I'm sorry if
I'm losing you guys it's like the
weirdest thing ever so when I get to the
window I'm like oh my god oh my god oh
my god and Janine is in my room watching
me on top of my bed you know like
watching me through the window I'm
outside she's inside she's like what
what is wrong what is wrong and I'm like
oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm like
freaking out I could barely talk and
she's like what is happening what's
wrong I'm gonna call him Fabio I'm like
Fabio was here with his friend Fabio we
just pulled up to my house with his
friend Fabio is here and she's like what
the hell was it what Fabio was here so
we start to freak out so then Fabio gets
out of the car pulls up to my house gets
out of the car with his friend and
starts walking towards me starts walking
to the side of my house before I get
into it let me tell you really quickly a
little situation so my grandmother lives
with me sort of hung up I always had
like a really big backyard our house was
very small but our yard was really big
so when my grandfather passed away my
dad built like a home for my grandmother
in my backyard it's a one-bedroom
apartment it has a kitchen a bathroom
like the room and then a living room so
it's like a full-on one-bedroom house in
our back yard it's like an efficiency I
don't know if everybody calls it that or
is that like a Hispanic word efficiency
it's like a studio apartment whatever so
that's in our backyard and she would get
to her house through the side of my
house because I had its own little
walkway its own little entrance I had a
green bench
under my window it was like a plastic
green bench that I would sit outside and
read books when I was younger not
younger like in high school I would go
outside like on a good day and I would
just sit on my bench and I would read
books and my grandma would also use that
to put all her groceries on before she
brought it into the house I hope you're
following so my grandma was the one who
initially put that bench there she was
like hey do you mind if I in Spanish but
she was like hey do you mind if I put
this here to put my groceries I was like
no perfect two birds with one stone I
could sit there outside and read my
books so we did that forever for like
years shoot my green bench was always
there for years anyway back to the story
so I see Fabio coming up to me with his
friend and I I'm panicking I was very
I'm not explaining it but I didn't do
really good in boys situations so he's
coming up to me and I'm like sweating at
this point my face is a bright red not
because oh my god Fabio was at my house
but because oh my god Fabio's on my
house and my dad is not here and if you
my dad gets here he's gonna kill Fabio
he's gonna shoot him gonna cool and then
kill me so he walks up to me and the
first thing I blurt out of my office
oh my god you have to leave you have to
get out of here and he's like hey you
know we were in the neighborhood and we
just thought by to say hi which was
really nice okay awesome yeah and I was
like that's great get out and he's like
what is wrong with you and I was like
you need to leave you got to get out of
here because my dad isn't here my mom's
not here and if they get home and they
see you here they are gonna flip their
 you need to leave my house he was
like okay
and then um handing the screen I have
Janine the screen and since I was so
nervous and I was so freaked out I go in
through the window
I don't walk them to the car and then go
inside my house to the front door like a
normal person
I literally throw myself in to my room
by the window and Fabio is kind of like
standing there like you know you have a
front door and I'm like okay bye you see
if I text me later it was like the
weirdest moment ever I don't even know
why I just threw myself to the window
and here Janine is like grabbing my butt
and my jeans and like trying to squeeze
me into the window because I had to get
on top of my bench
to get in the window because I mentioned
earlier that my window was really high
off the ground for some strange reason
even though it was a one-story house so
Janine is like grabbing my button
lifting me into the window I had to get
on the bench and then throw myself and
it was just a weirdest situation that I
panicked in yeah that happened and then
Fabio left and went on his merry way we
popped the screen back in and we forgot
about it my parents brought us food when
they got home and you know the day was
over wrong then the next day Janine
comes over my house again or she slept
over I'm not exactly sure it was all a
blur so I don't know she was either
sleeping home where she came over again
and we're just hanging out and just
talking and then she gets a phone call
from her dad he calls her and I hear him
like it's very loud you know like she
she didn't have it on speaker but I can
hear him and he's like hey what were you
doing yesterday and she's like nothing I
was at Kathleen's house and he's like
did you go anywhere and she's like no we
just stayed here all day and he's like
you're not lying to me right and she's
like no I was at Kathleen's house and he
was like okay I believe you and she was
like okay and then they hung up and
Jenni was like that is so weird my dad
is never weird like that that is so
strange and I'm like what but we kind of
brushed it under the rug we were like
maybe he was just worried or asking I
don't know we let it go then the next
day
these are little events that started
happening so then the next day or like
the day after I go outside and I noticed
my bench is gone my green bench I went
outside to read a book and my bench was
no longer there a bench that had been
there for years and I'm like what the
heck where's my bench so I go to my
grandma's house and ask her I'm like uh
Kip ah so you know like what is
happening fine I was ordered to take the
bench away I was ordered to remove it
and I was like by who
and she's like by your aren't her
daughter my dad's sister and I was like
excuse me what the hell does she have to
do it what so I was very confused so
then the following day I go to my
cousin's house
my aunts house with all my cousins and
my cousin tells me she's like hey I know
what you did last weekend or whatever
and I'm like what are you talking about
and she like tells me in secret she's
like I heard that you listen to this
she's like I heard that you and Janine
snuck out of your house at 3:00 in the
morning with two boys I literally like
my jaw dropped I was like what I
honestly could not believe it I ran to
my aunts room and I was like who told
you that because my cousin told me that
because manometer so I was like what who
told you that and she was like I heard
but don't worry I haven't told your
parents nobody knows I sat there for
like two hours trying to defend me in
Jenin I was like we would never what
whatever I was like okay yeah two guys
that come to my house but it was like
two o'clock in the afternoon not two
o'clock in the morning and I didn't
leave with them I stayed at my house
they were there for literally guys guys
they were there for like three minutes
so I did not know how this happens or
how anybody found out or like invented
the story they were there for about
three minutes I explained to them
exactly what happened and they were like
oh they were looking at me honestly if I
would have heard this story I wouldn't
have believed it either like yeah um I
push the screen out because I was gonna
order pizza and then I ran outside
through the front door and then two guys
just showed up at my house and then
instead of going through the front door
I threw myself through the window who is
gonna believe that because I wouldn't
either so my family my cousins were like
uh-huh yeah sure
nobody believed me I called Jeanine and
I told her story and then it all starts
to click Janine's like that is why my
dad asked me what I was doing that day
and that is why they took the bench away
they took the bench away because they
think you are using that bench as a
stepping stool to escape in the middle
of the night and I was like oh my god
literally it blew my mind especially
since Jeanine and I were such good we
still are we're kids were good kids we
did we never broke the rules Jeanine and
I are like good good like little
innocent like daughters we'd never did
anything wrong
but it still didn't make sense how my
aunt knew because we were completely by
ourselves that day so we started with
like we sat down and we were like break
our heads like who could have told her
nobody it was just me Janine Fabio and
his friend and Fabio does friend didn't
know my aunt you know so we were like oh
my god what happened you know it was
like two weeks where we didn't know who
told my aunt whatever so like two weeks
later I'm talking to Fabio and he I
didn't want to tell him the story
because I didn't want him to think that
like he got me in trouble so I didn't
tell him anything and then he sends me a
text message um like when we started
talking again he sends me a text message
he's like hey your neighbor seems like a
real nice guy and I'm like come again
he's like yeah when I was leaving that
your neighbor was standing at the fence
like staring at us and then as I was
leaving I waved at him and he waved back
as we drove off I was like immediately
the first thing that came into my head
I apology in the second he text me that
so I sort of she's like what the hell
which is crazy because this guy has been
my neighbor since I was a little girl I
lived in the same house my entire life
till I got married and moved out that
was my home forever and this guy I froze
long as I can remember has been my
neighbor I'm gonna call him so I
was like can you believe at his
face is the link in the ass face it was
 and she's like I can't believe
it
what the hell he completely made that up
that isn't st. because either he's out
of his mind
or he's a liar because it was clearly
like two o'clock in the afternoon
he's either completely crazy and really
truly believed that it was midnight or
whatever the only way that I can think
that came up with that story is
because he probably saw two boys he
probably came outside Wow Fabio and his
friend were leaving and then he saw me
go into my window that is the only thing
that I can think of that he walked out
the second these guys got back in their
car and he saw me freak out and throw
myself in the window and then he helped
he saw jeanine helping me in so he was
like oh these girls must have been gone
and I was when they're getting home
maybe he thought we were gone all night
and then two o'clock in the afternoon is
when we got home I don't know I don't
know what was thinking you know
you would you would think that
everything was perfectly fine but no um
till this day I am 23 years old till
this day my mom's husband like my uncle
he says it as a joke
but he calls us the window hose which
seems kind of messed up but it really
bothered us in the beginning but it's
funny now since it's like five seven
years later six years later whatever he
will not stop referring to us as window
hoes and it's been like that for the
past six years every time we're in a
room together and he sees us he calls us
window hoes because I don't think that
they ever believed us used to be kind of
frustrating now is kind of funny to me
no one would ever believe that story
ever
who why would I throw myself into
it was a door that completes this cat
just story um I promise you my other
ketchup videos will be more entertaining
I just wanted to tell you guys this
story I'm thinking of doing a storytime
cat chats and then a picture one again
and then that positivity one if you guys
want to and like maybe like boy stories
and stuff so let me know what you would
like to see and leave me a comment down
below of something super awkward that
happened to you in high school or while
you're in high school or middle school
something really awkward that happened I
want to know your awkward stories
because I have been in the most awkward
situations in my entire life
always my life is one awkward moment so
