something a little bit different I
haven't done a video like this on my
channel for a really long time I'm gonna
be sharing with you some fashion pieces
I just recently picked up mainly from
forever21 you guys know it's like my
favorite place to shop it's cheap and
it's cute it's not the best quality but
I feel like my sense of style is always
changing and I'm always wanting to try
new things so I rather not spend so much
money on clothes like pants and shirts
so that's why I love forever 21 I also
have a couple of things from misguided
and other stores I'll let you know as I
go but it's mainly forever21 by the way
let me address the elephant in the room
or the elephant is the room I should say
this is my bedroom I was gonna film this
video in my beauty room but there's just
a lot going on in my Beauty room right
now that it cannot kind of function in
there actually have like nothing on the
walls in this room all my walls are bare
I have nothing on my nightstand like a
candle and like flowers all I have is
like furniture I've been wanting to go
to home goods to trip what what am I
saying this video isn't about that I
don't have like a ton of stuff to share
with you but I did want to show you the
recent things I bought for spring and
summer if you guys do like this type of
video leave me a comment down below and
I will definitely do more of these maybe
I'll throw in some look books every once
in a while I know I mentioned a while
back but I wanted to get into fashion
videos but with the move it just never
happened like as soon as I said that I
moved and crazy things have been
happening but now that I'm nice and
settled if that's something you want me
to incorporate like fashion videos let
me know i'li okay I'm gonna show you the
little tops I got first I'm someone who
really really loves crop tops if I have
high-waisted shorts on or a high waisted
skirt high-waisted something I will
never wear a crop top unless I have
something high-waisted because I do not
like to show my stomach not like the
whole stomach anyway I don't mind
showing like the top or a little piece
of my belly button but not even that
it's just something I don't like to show
that much but I thought this shirt would
look so cute during the summer time like
at the beach about this at misguided
calm and it doesn't say how much it was
but it says mermaid hair don't care how
cute is that I think this would look so
cute on top of a bikini with like
high-waisted jeans shorts another shirt
I got from misguided I fell in love with
this when I saw it
a hanger okay this is a little better
obviously these don't go on your
shoulders you just straps for you to
hang it up but isn't this shirt so
beautiful it's just like a regular
little white crop top very thin material
I love that it has this around the neck
and usually I don't like shirts that
have necklaces already like in them but
I thought this one was really pretty it
just looks like a simple gold choker I
thought this would be perfect for the
summertime because I love wearing white
in the summer especially with gold red
lipstick and like a pencil skirt I think
it is a really pretty top I don't know
why they don't put the prices on these
things this crop top I got at forever 21
and it was only eight dollars and ninety
cents and it's a really really
comfortable material again one of those
shirts that I think is perfect for the
spring time with high-waisted jeans
shorts nice light distressed jean shorts
and I love the flower print I love to
wear anything floral in the spring and
summer this crop top I bought at Urban
Outfitters and I don't remember how much
it was but I remember it being
ridiculous it was actually very very
very expensive but I've been on the hunt
for something baby blue and lace for
such a long time now that when I saw in
Urban Outfitters I was like okay fine
I'll buy they also had the matching
skirt on the Urban Outfitters website
but I didn't want to spend that much
money on just one single outfit so I
figured I would just get the crop top
and mix and match the bottom with like a
nude pencil skirt or like a white skirt
I just love pastels this time of year I
couldn't resist oh my gosh okay so I got
this cardigan from forever 21 cardigan
so we call these things I have like a
thousand of these I love these and you
would think you have fifty you don't
need any more but no no no I just I keep
buying them they're my favorite thing to
wear I keep saying this time of year but
they are they're my favorite thing to
wear in the spring and summer because
all I do is put on a pair of distressed
jeans a white tank top and I bust out a
chiffon cardigan thing but the amazing
thing about this one is guys I had been
on the hunt for a white and pink floral
cardigan like this since last year who
didn't find it anywhere but this
this year I found it forever 21 I love
the coral tones to these flowers I think
it would look so beautiful with a peachy
coral lipstick I love this it reminds me
of like Matilda's teacher's cottage or
like an old tablecloth from back in the
day I know it's beautiful okay so
another thing apparently I can't get
enough of our shirt dresses I love
buying those dresses that just look like
really long shirts because I love
wearing them with like gladiator sandals
and a hat and then I saw this shirt
dress thing which I don't know if
they're called shirt dresses but that's
what I called him and I fell in love
with it this is again from forever 21
and it was $15.90 I think it's so pretty
it says realist number one I love these
long baggy black tops because I can pair
it with any lip color is that weird I
feel like I shop for my clothes based on
my makeup I know that seems very strange
but every time I look at a top I'm like
mmm what lipstick would look good with
it and I feel like this is the kind of
outfit that would look awesome with so
many different makeup looks how cool
would this look with high over-the-knee
boots I'm into that I'm totally into
that okay now let's talk about a dress
that looks completely different from
what I just showed you I bought this
specifically for the summertime because
this screams summer to me and I know
that a lot of people might look at this
and be like that is hideous you look
like you're about to go make wine in a
vineyard or something I don't know
Chiquita banana status I know but I love
this look by the way excuse all oily I
look I rarely ever say I look oily but I
had been sweating I've had my makeup on
for a while and I had been sweating for
like an hour before I filmed this video
anyway what I was saying if I could put
my personality I put myself into a dress
it would be this and I don't care who
thinks this is ugly but it just like
reminds me of Celia crew and I'm not mad
at it with the right accessories and the
right hairstyle and the right makeup I
think it would look so summery and boho
and beautiful I love this so I picked up
a pair of overalls at Agassi and I
freaking love overalls like can I live
in overalls I wish I got these because I
thought they were such a pretty color
they're a little bit distressed here
they're a nice olive color and they are
shorts I don't know how
much this was wait wait this was $27.90
I really like these the only thing I
will say is that they fit me a little
bit snug like in my bottom area right
here they're a little snug if you have
seen these at Agassi I would recommend
going a size up my besides that I think
it's really really cute Oh oh my god
okay so I bought this for the beach it's
just kind of like a bathing suit
cover-up it has that really amazing
breathable like linen material that's
perfect for on top your ratings who like
on the beach when I first put this on
I'm not gonna lie to you there was
something about kind of like the design
here that made me feel like I kind of
look like Thackery Binx looking for my
sister Emily Emily it grew on me and I
think that with the right hat and the
right Beach I would really like this
okay two more items to show you before I
show you like the accessories I bought I
didn't buy many accessories I love this
jumpsuit to me this is the perfect
summer jumpsuit I love love love love
love navy blue and I love how it has
pink and orange flowers all over it it's
completely backless which is awesome for
the summertime and it's such a
breathable material I got this at
forever 21
it was $22.90 so pretty for like a
tropical vacation getaway and very very
comfortable to wear the only thing is I
have to kind of um fix the pants because
I'm too short for this as I always am
for anything i buy it forever 21
whenever I buy pants there I always have
to get it fixed I wish they had a petite
section the way that misguided does
misguided Nasty Gal Topshop they're a
couple of stores that have petite
sections for people that are under five
three and I'm 5-1 and a half five two
ish so I always got to be fixing them
pants at forever 21 but that's okay so
pretty okay so the last piece of
clothing I have is this guy right here
this is a romper love rompers they're so
easy especially when it's really hot
outside it's so hot here in Miami and
when it's really hot outside it's
awesome to just throw on a romper cuz
they're short and they're usually very
fresco I love the print on this I am
obsessed with anything that has flowers
on it like I've already said especially
red flowers I love this I love the green
and red together I love that it's
completely backless as well
this kind of threw me off at first I
don't usually love these kinds of cuts
here but surprisingly I really like it
on this romper but I think it's really
pretty it was $33.90
at Agassi I love this I got a couple of
accessories I got three necklaces and a
purse I'm really into chokers right now
I love like the gold chokers and I'm not
really into the fabric chokers that much
like the black fabric but I have a
fabric one here to show you and I really
love it I got this at forever 21 I don't
exactly know how much it was but it just
looks like a strip of pink lace it's so
pretty and I thought that it wasn't
gonna fit my neck but it's long enough
to where I think it would fit pretty
much anyone's neck really I think this
would look so beautiful with like a
tight white dress with your hair up in a
bun nice dewy skin I love this color as
well very into it right now I also got
this necklace from forever 21 this one
was six dollars and ninety cents I love
the mix of black and gold I thought this
necklace was also really cool I thought
I would give like the perfect pop to any
outfit kind of spice it up a little bit
and then the last necklace I bought I
bought it at misguided calm again I
don't know how much this is they don't
put the prices but this is just a really
pretty gold choker it's actually very
very skinny a first one I got in the
mail was like oh my gosh this is not
gonna fit my neck and it just like
barely fits you just like clamp it
around your neck I think it's so
beautiful I love this purse so much when
I saw them the forever21 website I knew
I had to get it I have already used it
once so I don't have the price on it but
look at this stunner right here how
beautiful is this purse I love fringe I
was into fringe a little bit more last
summer but I really love fringe on my
purses now it's like I want fringe and
all my purses it's so pretty it has kind
of like a brass chain so you can wear it
crossbody or you can wear it as a clutch
you can put this chain inside the purse
and hold it as a clutch my favorite
thing definitely has to be the color I
think it's beautiful I got this at
forever 21 online I don't know if they
have it in store really love this purse
