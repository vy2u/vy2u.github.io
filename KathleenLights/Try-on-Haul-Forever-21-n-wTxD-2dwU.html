darling I'm filming so today's video is
going to be a forever 21 haul I haven't
done a fashion haul on my channel in
like a year
No oh my god has it been a year a really
long time I'm a little sick by the way
story of my life my immune system sucks
and I go to the doctor regularly I just
you know those people who like never get
sick Danny he's one of them like never
get sick I could be fully sick rub my
body all over his face and he'll never
get sick a baby 700 miles away from me
sneezes and I get sick it's ridiculous I
usually do Beauty hauls but I tweeted if
you guys wanted to see the stuff that I
got at forever 21 and a lot of you guys
said yes I also picked up a couple of
things from necessary clothing I had
never shopped there before but I decided
to give it a try and then I did buy some
shoes as well I did all my shopping
online because I hate shopping
like I hate shopping with makeup it's
different cuz I don't have to go into a
dressing room and try on a bunch of
things I hate taking my clothes off
putting it back on taking my clothes on
what a me oh my go I hate that process
okay so I'm going to go ahead and get
started um my style is very very basic
like if I can me and t-shirts and shorts
every single day of my life I will
that's just what I like to wear I wish
my style had a little Morton but I just
I like to be cute but casual that's how
I like to very basic
if you guys followed you fall I'm crazy
on Instagram I'm Rosie no I'm pretty
sure it's Emery Z she has like the best
style ever like she just has like a
Kardashian everyday and I like like look
through her Instagram and I'm like my
god she dresses so good I actually saw
her I didn't meet her but I saw her at
IMAX LA and I swear like she walked by
me and like the wind walked with her
like she had an entourage and she was
walking and like the wind was pretty
much blowing in her hair I was like
standing in the corner and as soon as
she walked by I was like
anyway that's how I feel I love her
style and I just can't I just can't go
out like that every day because I'm lazy
so I'm gonna go ahead and get into her I
feel like I've been talking for 40
minutes so I'm gonna start off with the
things I got it necessary clothing and I
was a little bit disappointed I had
never ordered from them before and I put
in my order and I feel like the sizing
was kind of off so I picked up these
jeans they're like boyfriend jeans I
love ripped jeans they are my favorite
things to wear and even though I really
really love how they look on I have to
wear a long shirt with it because this
looks like I'm wearing a bumpin like I
look like I am wearing a diaper like in
my butt and you know like this area
right here because it's so baggy and I
got my right size like in jeans I'm
always that size but it was a little bit
baggy I'm still going to keep it because
I just love how cute it looks they're
kind of like capris like the boyfriend
jeans um but I'm just gonna have to wear
long shirts with them but I still really
like it I really recommend it if you can
find your perfect size I picked up these
shorts and these are good like these fit
me good they're a little tight um but
they fit me really nicely these are just
random rip shorts I live in South
Florida now and I haven't had a pair of
shorts in a long long time so in
Mississippi I didn't really wear shorts
but yeah they're really pretty um if you
have a big booty I would steer clear
from these because I feel like they're
so short that if you've got a big booty
it would just like hang out of these
shorts I don't know they're very very
short I'm gonna wear them most likely
just to go to the beach like with my
bikini under these because they're low
risk high for me and it does not have
the price of this I kept the price tags
on so I could tell you guys the price
but I cannot find the price but it is
more expensive than forever21 like
significantly more expensive I know
everybody like hates on forever 21
because it's like cheap clothing and it
breaks easily but there are stuff in my
closet that I've had for like four years
from forever 21 and it's still going
strong I like it because they have
really cute clothes like run
- closed for really cheap I'm not about
that life like I'm not about spending
$50 on the t-shirt like I'm sure I just
won't
oh but necessary clothing wasn't like
super pricey but it was a little bit
more attentive I got this romper which
this one that was actually $34.99 and
it's just a really cute black and white
romper when I first got it I was like
this looks like really large but it
actually fits really pretty um I like
black and white clothing because you can
wear with like any makeup like any
lipstick and yeah I like to dress
according to my makeup that's what I
pick this up it's just white completely
on the back and then it has the pop of
black in the front what party you can't
sit on me and fill me a little video
silly boy so like the blush colors are
my favorite colors to wear I just think
they look so so beautiful especially for
the springtime so I picked up this
really pretty long pencil skirt from
necessary clothing I don't have the
price on this one but it's really pretty
the only thing that throws me off is
like this whole looking thing in the
back which is nice but unless you're
wearing a crop top it does look kind of
weird like if you're wearing a shirt
tucked in it looks strange but I can
look past that because I think it fits
really pretty and it's such a nice color
and the material is nice and stretchy so
you can get away with like you know
squeezing into it and then on the
website I stumbled upon some sunglasses
I am like a big Shay Mitchell fan I
followed her on Instagram and I saw that
on the brand necessary clothing they
sell this brand which I'm not exactly
sure if it's qat Quay I've heard people
say its key I'm not exactly sure but
they are super cute really trendy
glasses sunglasses and I decided to buy
these because they're like from the
shade Mitchell line and it says let the
shine wait what the lights red maybe let
the light shine and I thought it was
cute
and this is what the glasses look like
they're so pretty they're gold and I
think they're like fun aren't they cool
I think they're cool
okay so that was everything I got
unnecessary clothing now I'm gonna go
through all the things I got at forever
21 so I saw the song online and I bought
it just for the back of it it's a very
simple like basic t-shirt and it looks
kind of weird like from the front
because you're like what was it but it's
really really cute it has an open back
which is why I bought it because I think
this would look so pretty with like my
hair up in a bun and like ripped jeans
and it's a very breathable material so
it's nice for this time of year and the
fact that it has like a bunch of daisies
all over I think it's just so pretty for
spring I love the open back the only bad
thing is that obviously your bra shows
through the back so I have to wear like
one of those like suction cup bras that
I have from Victoria's Secret that work
well with things like this but I really
like that this was very cheap it was 14
bucks I'm gonna go through all the
shirts I got because that's mainly what
I got like little t-shirts and stuff
this one was 14 as well and I think it's
so cute it says wifey which I think it's
okay I've been wanting a top that says
wifey for a long time I just I'm not in
love with the way that this fits on my
body for some reason it seems a little
boxy um so I don't know I have to play
around with it more maybe wear different
like shorts or different jeans but I
just love what it says and it's so
comfortable it feels like a pajama I
bought two muscle tees which I freaking
loves muscle tees because I just wear
like a sports bra underneath and then
I'm good to go
I love them I got this one because it
reminded me of my dad this is a van
Halen one van Halen is a band and I got
it because my dad is like obsessed with
Eddie Van Halen he's like one of the
best guitar players of all time and
stuff so he says and I used to jam to
Van Halen like when I lived with my dad
like GM to Van Halen so I got this
because he reminded of my puppy and this
was also $14 and then I got this one
which is like the most comfortable
material I've ever felt in my entire
life and it's so pretty it says Karma I
really like the idea of this shirt has
like the little arrow like what goes
around
that was me singing Justin Timberlake if
you didn't get that this one is really
really comfy and it was also oh no this
was 1290 so I was a little bit cheaper
it's so comfortable so I'm a little bit
addicted to kimonos just a little bit a
lot of it I have like 75 kimonos and I
just can't get enough so I got this one
because I thought it would look so
beautiful with like red lipstick or like
an orange e lipstick this one was
fourteen ninety which I thought for a
kimono was pretty cheap because usually
forever21 has like twenty dollars or
twenty five and it's really nice it's
very not thick but it's very strong
material it actually feels really
high-quality it doesn't feel like cheap
at all and I think it's really really
elegant um it's it's not super super
long but it's not like a very short one
either
and I was very very impressed with this
it actually had really good reviews
online which is why I bought it and yeah
I go million
I got another pencil skirt you can't go
wrong with pencil skirts in my opinion
and I got a black one because black
pretty much goes with everything it's
very slimming and this is like cotton
it's very comfortable and it was only
eight ninety so it was nine dollars for
really pretty casual like day-to-day
pencil skirt I wouldn't necessarily wear
this like to a very fancy like you know
whatever but it's a nice pencil skirt
like for the daytime okay so the rest of
the things I got were like dresses 101
is a romper I'll show you the romper
um I love this romper I was very very
concerned that it was going to be too
too long on me because everything that I
order from forever 21 in terms of pants
or uppers are like very long on me
because I'm so short I'm five two and
nothing just nothing looks good on me
but this romper was actually a decent
size I may have to wear wedges with it
but that's okay it's one of those that
has like a really pretty like backless
kind of look and then I have like a
spaghetti strap kind of thing and it
ties right here at the waist but it's
not one of those things that make you
look like chubby or at the waist I
usually stay away from like those maxi
skirts that have like the weird elastic
that always make my stomach look kind of
strange but this doesn't do that this is
the perfect black romper I'm so excited
that I found one and this
2980 okay so this dress I was super
disappointed in not disappointed in when
I put it on I was like oh it's cute but
I it didn't fit the way I expected it to
fit it didn't fit the way it fit on the
model and if this one right here this
was twenty four ninety and it is um like
a lace blush-colored dress and it is I
just poked myself in the eye with this
it doesn't fit the way that I wanted to
on the sleeves and it's a little bit
loose I wish it was just a little bit
tighter like on the arms on me because
it does fit strange a little business I
don't know if you guys can tell do you
think it looks bad let me know because
it does fit a little bit loose and I
honestly don't know what to do with it I
hate returning things especially online
but I like it but then I don't but I
think it's really really beautiful
especially the back I think it's just
gorgeous and then the last two things I
got from forever 21 clothing wise or
like dresses and this one at first I was
like that's a very strange dress but
that is why I bought it
it was 2490 and this is from the love 21
brand which always runs bigger than what
it actually is so I got it an extra
small and it's basically just a
pineapple like kind of what it is is a
big piece of like fabric like you can
make this at your house honestly like
you really can but I really liked the
material and I loved the pattern like as
you like isn't the pattern so pretty
I think so aramide and my friend
Samantha and I really like it about it
specifically to wear over my bathing
suits like when I'm out at the beach and
stuff because it's literally just like a
fabric that falls over your body it's
not like super like fitting towards the
body or makes you look nice and curvy
it's just like a long fabric but I think
it's nice for the beach and then this is
probably the my most favorite thing that
I got in this haul it is beautiful oh my
god so beautiful it is this dress right
here and I love I love the print this is
such a beautiful spring and summer print
more for spring but it is gorgeous it
was only seventeen ninety and for a
really pretty dress like this that was
very expensive um this is the front and
it has like this cut right here like the
cut like right here it doesn't show your
boobs or anything but it has like a
really pretty feminine cut and then it
has slits at the bottom and I think that
the slits are so pretty like when you're
walking your leg shows and stuff it's
very feminine very beautiful a little
bit like see-through but only towards
the bottom so the rest of the body isn't
see-through I just love everything about
it
it's my favorite I'm going to show you
the accessories I got at forever 21 I
got a couple of headbands I'm very into
headbands or like head wraps and stuff I
got a basic black one these are kind of
like those turban things you can't tell
better like cinches right here those are
like those nice like turban headbands
that I think are really pretty and then
I got this one that I think is so like
um old-school like I don't know I don't
know what that was but like old-school
like back in the day sailor type of
thing I just think it's so so pretty
it's black and white has that little
Bowl that I loved and I got this which
is old you this is like a typical
bandanna print in red but it has like
this little bow right here and this
would look so cute with a bun I don't
know I really like this I think would
like spruce up any outfit to add a
little bit of cuteness there I got two
necklaces this one is a very feminine
like dainty necklace let me show you can
go go look how pretty this is it's just
like a basic little gold chain but it
has three like green forest green
gemstones at the bottom and I think it's
really really feminine like very simple
a feminine I typically like jewelry like
this for day to day not something so
bulky or like such a statement necklace
but the next necklace that I bought is a
statement necklace and it is this one
right here I think this is so gorgeous I
saw that my sister picked this up and I
was like I have to have that I love that
it has like this really pretty Jade teal
color here and I think that that's what
sold me on it cuz it has like that pop
of color that's so pretty I mean it's
like very like
I feel like as techie I don't know it's
nice it was 40 90 which is pretty
freakin expensive for a necklace but it
is one of those statement pieces so
these are obviously more and then the
last thing I got from from 21 was this
clutch I haven't wanted a brown clutch
for a while and I like that this one is
big and then you just like fold it so a
lot of stuff fits in here and it's
simple I didn't want to clutch with like
straps or anything I just wanted one to
hold so that was everything I've got a
forever 21 and I'm actually going to
show you some shoes that I bought - so
my sister introduced me to this
beautiful beautiful beautiful website
that I feel the need to share with you
guys I have always shopped for shoes um
at like really really inexpensive places
I just really didn't care I felt like
okay the cheaper the better because I
didn't exactly have money for like
really pricey name-brand shoes but my
sister introduced me to this website a
while ago and I've been getting my shoes
from this website it's called six pm
comm and they sell name-brand shoes on
sale so they have like a bunch of shoes
on sale my favorite shoes to wear our
Jessica Simpson's and Steve Maddens
that's the website I go to find Jessica
Simpson's shoes MC Madden shoes I
promise you this is not like a joke or
anything
this website is amazing I got I saved a
hundred dollars I bought two pair of
shoes and I saved a hundred dollars I'm
not exactly sure how much they were
originally all I know is that at the end
like when you pay for everything it says
congratulations you saved so-and-so an
amount of money and it tells you what
the sale price is I believe I paid
thirty or forty dollars for these shoes
which they were a lot more than that so
I'm gonna show them - they are Jessica
Simpson shoes um and I love them this is
what they look like this is I forgot
what color these are terribly cold under
color it says LT luggage not as I
mention what that means but it's that
really pretty like dark um mahogany
I know rounds actually my favorite color
to wear on my feet I shall have shoes
these color and they have like a little
wedge
I love wedges I'm not very good at
walking in heels
I'm just not so I always go for wedges
because there are a lot more casual than
heels and I'm a la I'm just a casual
what kind of
out so I love it I love that they have
like this thing right here you tie him
up and you could tie them according to
like the size of your foot so it's not
so loose like you could really tie them
I think they're beautiful and I loved it
so much that I saw that they had the
exact same pair in black so that is what
I get so this is what they look like in
black really cute again perfect black
goes with everything and I love that
it's black and brown which I really love
how black and brown looks a lot of
people don't but it's kind of my
favorite combination black and brown
looks so pretty together I really like
it so I'm gonna try to find these and
link them below because they're really
good price and I just I love 6:00 p.m.
