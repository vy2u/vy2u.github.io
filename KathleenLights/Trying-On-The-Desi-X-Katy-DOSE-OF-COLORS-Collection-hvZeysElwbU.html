I'm so excited I'm going to be reviewing
the new dose of colors collection with
desi and Katy this is their newest
collab and I love when influencers
collab with brands because I love seeing
the colors they put together and what
they create and I haven't been this
excited in a really long time for a
collab I'm just so proud of desi and
Katy I know you've seen about a million
reviews on this collection already but
it's been so highly requested you guys
really wanted to see me try this out and
I haven't opened anything like anything
i just opened the box and I peeked
inside but I haven't opened anything and
I'm so excited I wanted to do that on
camera with you guys I'm going to try
out as many products as I can and I will
give you swatches and all that good
stuff so yeah let's jump in I mean what
else is there to say so this collection
already launched I'm on the dose of
colors website and it is currently sold
out but I hear that they are bringing it
back in September which is amazing if
you missed out on the first launch and
I'm not sure if they're selling these
boxes I don't think so I think these
were just like PR packages but it comes
in a box like this with their beautiful
saison on the inside I mean look at this
look at this photo portrait support you
get an eyeshadow quad two highlights two
lipsticks two liquid lipsticks and a lip
gloss I'm going to go ahead and open
these babies think I want to start the
setup with the eyeshadow pause so the
packaging on everything is absolutely
gorgeous I love the packaging on this
quad like gorgeous and then this is what
it looks like on the inside and you do
get a mirror it's not huge but it's
definitely big enough I really like that
there's a mirror and these are the
colors I think they are gorgeous so
before I get into the swatches really
quick this card explains how you're
supposed to use them these two shades
right here
soothes and harpoons they are meant to
be used wet for that super ultra
metallic finish and then the other three
shades
turbo-san and Noli you don't have to wet
them but they do recommend that you
apply all of these eyeshadows with your
finger anyway alright so I really want
to wear harpoon all over the lid
mentioned my green shirt and then I'll
probably do Sue's on the inner corners
also I'll see what I do so let me zoom
we wean okay so I know this sounds weird
but I'm actually going to spray makeup
revolution aqua priming base onto my
finger
is that weird probably actually I should
do that my left finger and I'm going to
dip my finger into harpoon and you don't
have to worry about messing up these
eyeshadows they're meant to be wet
you're always going to use them wet so
you're not going to ruin them if you go
in with like a wet brush or a wet finger
that looks so cool
my hair is driving me nuts so I picked
it up really quickly I'm going to go
into my narcissus eyeshadow palette and
I'm just going to blend out the edges
this is like the peachy color I have in
my crease right now and I want to blend
out the harsh lines when you're going to
use these eyeshadows I would definitely
recommend doing your eye makeup before
your face makeup because they do have a
bit of fallout since you have to apply
them wet and they're just really really
intense and glittery and shimmery so
some of it might fall on your face if
you're like blending the colors together
so just keep that in mind I always do my
eye makeup first but for the sake of
this video I did not okay so I quickly
finished up my eye makeup because I
didn't want this video to be too long
but I just used to tie shadows from this
narcissus palette I used these LAN days
LOM base 1b song but the entire lid is
mainly harpoon so sparkly and fun
perfect for a night out clubbing
weddings events like this is so
glamorous I love it I'm going to take
the shade Sue's right here and I'm going
to do the same thing bring my little
pinky I'm just going to pack that on my
inner corner I'm actually going to bring
some of that onto my lid
okay so I think the pop on the inner
corners of the eyes with that gold made
it look so cool I really love this
I can't wait to use this purple and this
bronze like discolor is speaking to me
but I really wanted to use the green
today and yeah so far so good I give
this an A+ all right now let's move on
to the highlight there are two
highlights in the collection one is
called the wiggle which is the lighter
of the two it looks darker in the pan as
are you lighter when you swatch it so
don't get scared if you are fair it does
swatch lighter and then the other shade
is called meat on it and this one is a
little bit deeper but it's more of like
a rose gold but not like pinky rose gold
it's very much golden does my finger in
there I'm going to try both of these on
my face today
I'm actually pretty tan I haven't been
this tan in so long
I'm sure you guys can tell because these
lights tend to wash me out a bit to give
you a reference I'm going to use giorgio
armani luminous silk I know a lot of
people use that foundation and I'm
usually normally like a four and right
now I'm like a six summer has been hot
here man and I've been in my mother's
pool so I'm much tenor than usual so I'm
going to see if I can get away with
meetup man I don't know let's see I'm
going to take the shade boy go first and
I'm taking my Linda Hallberg 306 brush
there is a much kick up with this
that is beautiful and I don't even have
to do another way or I mean I did dip my
brush in a bunch of times but it's so
pretty oh I really like it because I'm
not huge on golden highlights but this
isn't too yellow that's my issue with
some gold highlights some of them have
like a strong yellow undertone but this
one doesn't I love it I love it it is so
view my god so beautiful
I'm going to clean my brush off on a
little towel and then I'm going to go in
with meat on it on this side hopefully
this doesn't look like a stripe on my
face although it might not as dark as I
thought it was going to be I mean you
could totally see it there when I look
forward you can kind of see the line
there but for my fan I don't think it's
too dark
I'm like that is reflected but if you
have a medium to deep skin tone I think
this will look gorgeous
on your skin oh my gosh like I love it I
love it too huge thumbs up for me huge
thumbs up and this targetting is just
okay so now let's talk about the lip
product I'm going to swatch them all on
my lips so you can see them all let's
start off with the lip gloss I do want
to try it out on top of a lipstick but I
want to see how it looks on its own as
well this is what the packaging looks
like again amazing they did such a good
job on this packaging it just looks so
expensive like sorting and this gloss is
called over the top it's pretty much
just like a clear gloss with a ton of
little gold reflex in it it is gorgeous
whoo oh my god this is such a Gabi gloss
my friend Gabby she's a makeup artist
and loves glosses like this I usually
don't like clear glosses but this would
look so nice on top of a nude we will
see in a second and it just makes you
look slim nice and juicy right I think
it's sticky but it doesn't feel like
grupe sticky and you can kind of feel
the glitter but not so much where it's
going to bother
you or annoying you it's so so fine
they're not chunky glitters at all
alright so we have two lipsticks to talk
about this packaging I keep talking
about packaging but this is soft touch
you know like that Nora's feeling and
I'm crazy about soft touch it took my
favorite type of packaging so into this
I love it and this like nude color is
gorgeous this is called no shade and it
is a really pretty like peachy nude and
I love how it says luster Lux and desi
Perkins on the packaging of pretty much
everything it's so nice like so much
thought went into this packaging and I
loved it so this is what no shade looks
like on my lips I actually like it a lot
more than I thought I were going to like
it I thought it was going to be just a
little bit too nude for me but I like it
I've actually really been into really
nude lipsticks recently and this one is
gorgeous it is a matte finish but it
doesn't look bad it doesn't look choppy
or dry on the lip and usually like these
light peachy nudes when they're matte
can look a little chalky but this one
doesn't it sounds really nice keep in
mind though anything deeper than my skin
tone might think that this is just a
little bit too nude for them but I think
it's so pretty I really like it I am
going to put on the over-the-top gloss
just so you can see how it looks this
makes it a little less peachy
very JLo ask very jealous all right next
up we have more creamer please which is
such a cute name and this one is the
deeper nude out of the two and my lips
are so dry right now and cracki and
gross and I still thought that this
lipstick look nice which on these lips I
thought it was a look terrible alright
so what do you guys think of this one I
think on me it doesn't well feels like
on me it looks a little too warm I think
the color is beautiful don't get me
wrong I just don't know if I like it
against my skin tone I don't know what
you think come your opinion below this
is also a matte but a very very creamy
matte very comfortable on the lips too
I'm going to add the over-the-top gloss
on this one as well just to see the
gloss almost makes this color look a
little bit more caramely alright good
stuff let's move on to the liquid
lipsticks
ok so first up I'm going to take hot
fire which is this really gorgeous
orange you read it is absolutely
stunning these are my favorite kind of
lip colors to wear and a lot of you guys
have been tweeting me because I have a
shade I'm working on that looks almost
identical to this one
it's the lip color I was wearing in my
empties video it makes perfect sense
that desi would create a color like this
because I feel like she has that love
for red orange just as much as I do and
it's my favorite lip color on her like
every time she wears an orange lip on
like mine yes girl made for you so I'm
not surprised that she created a shade
like this and actually going to swatch
hers next to mine to see if there's that
similar okay no they look different
right well I see a slight difference
it's just so crazy to know we were both
like secretly working on the lip product
that looks very similar you just never
know what's going on behind the scenes
guys it's crazy so I'm going to swatch
hot-fire on my lips but I already know
it's amazing
oh by the way this is what the packaging
looks like it's actually pretty
different than their other liquid
lipstick packaging in the top it's just
like a little bit longer I just love it
I feel like colors like this are so sexy
and these colors look gorgeous all
across the board on every skin tone from
the deepest skin tone to like the
fairest skin tone this looks so good on
everyone and I really do like the
Joseph's colors liquid lipsticks so I
highly recommend it okay and their last
not least we have this shade called
savage which I love this name it's my
nickname for Selene because
Selene is very much a savage and this
one is like a deep deep plum shade
you
this color is amazing and looks so far I
know I love it
this color went on so smooth and so
pigmented a lot of the times these
deeper colors have a tricky color payoff
like some of them are really streaky
this one was perfect like look at that
but it's full color full pigment it's
amazing I really love why I love it so
much one I thought I would I rarely wear
colors like this but I feel like I'm
going to get a lot of use out of this
one in the wintertime
okay guys so that completes this video
those are my first impressions on
everything I loved everything I loved
the two eyeshadows I tried out the
lipsticks are really comfortable the
liquid lipsticks are really good I'm
rarely disappointed by dose of colors to
begin with so besides the fact though
this is a club like take desi and Katy
out of the equation Joseph call this is
amazing and I'm rarely disappointed by
them so I'm not surprised that I loved
everything I think it's really good
quality I think that the packaging is so
luxurious looking congratulations on

job on color selection packaging on
