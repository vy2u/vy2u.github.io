a double tutorial I don't think I've
ever done something like this but it's
been so requested to continue to do
tutorials using the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette so I thought I would combine
two and one this is the first look right
here this would look really nice for
spring it's just like a very dewy fresh
look no liner no falsies it's something
that's very very simple but it has like
that pop of purple and it's just a
little bit different than like a day to
day look but it is perfect for daytime
so if you want to see how to get look
number one then just keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyelids
and the first color I'm going in is with
milk chocolate I'm using the beauty by
Rosita brush and I'm just buffing this
into my crease to create a nice little
transition shade so all the colors can
blend nicely on top I'm going into
candied violet with a flat shader brush
and I'm applying this to the outer
corner of my eye and the inner corners
of my eye I'm gonna leave the center of
my lid blank because I'm going to go
over it with another eye shadow by the
way I'm losing my voice I don't know
what it is yeah I don't know life I
guess so I'm thinking candied violet
like a very little amount of candied
violet and I'm just buffing some of that
into my crease so that it all flows
together and I'm just intensifying you
know that Kandy violet some boat
now I'm going to go in with salted
caramel I love this shadow it's probably
my favorite in the palette and I'm just
adding this to my crease to warm up the
look a little bit and to just blend
everything together now marzipan which
is my other favorite in this palette and
I'm applying this directly in the center
of the lid wherever I didn't apply candy
violet that's where I'm applying this
and I'm just with the same brush just
mixing them together so that they blend
nicely into one another and then I just
added some more salted caramel into my
crease to highlight underneath my brow
bone I took a white chocolate and then
I'm gonna go in with marzipan and I'm
gonna mix it with champagne truffle so
I'm going to dip my brush into both of
these shadows and I'm going to use that
as my inner corner highlight yes okay
now I'm going to take my Rimmel
scandaleyes nude eyeliner and I'm going
to apply this to my waterline I wanted a
nude liner so that my eyes can look a
little bit bigger and more fresh and
then I took some candied violet and I
applied it underneath my lashes and then
I took salted caramel and buffed it
together I didn't show the shadows I
don't know why but I just used candied
violet and salted caramel and then I
applied some Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara and that completes the eyes it
was a very very simple I look I already
have my foundation and my concealer and
my powder on my face because I didn't
want this video to be too long but I do
want to show you really quickly the
other products I use in my face so I'm
just bronzing up my skin with my Too
Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm
using the NYX fan brush I believe that's
what is called to highlight my face I'm
gonna take crushed pearl from the
Anastacio glow kit
this is like the pinkier glow kit I
really really really love it it's
amazing so I'm just using crushed pearls
to have first pearl yes to highlight
tops of my cheekbones and my nose to get
extra highlighting and glowy for blush I
am taking the Wet n Wild ombre blush in
the shade might I buy you a drink
pretty sure that's the name of the blush
it will be listed below it's a very
sheer blush but it is really
really pretty now I'm taking the
cosmetics waterproof nude lip liner this
is called nude buff or buff nude and I'm
filling in my entire lips with this I
did over line my lips I did it
intentionally I wanted my lips to look
extra pouty and like bigger but don't do
it if you don't like that I just you
know want to change it up now I'm going
in with the makeup rubber plexi gloss
this is in the shade 202
this is a very thick but very glossy lip
gloss so I wanted my lips to look glossy
so that's what I did so that completes
look number one very springy daytime
fresh I really love it if you want to
see how to get look number two then
let's jump right into that
so I've already primed my lids and now
I'm going in with milk chocolate on a
fluffy blending brush and I'm just
buffing this on the outer corners and
then dragging it into my crease now
taking this really pretty shimmery
cranberry shade called amaretto and I'm
applying this to my entire lid just with
like a flat shader brush I'm taking it
all the way up to my crease but I'm not
passing my crease I just want it on my
lid I wanted a little bit more umph in
this eyeshadow so I took some mac fix+
and I sprayed it on my brush and then I
went in with it like that and you can
see that it just like intensifies the
eyeshadow a lot more makes it look a
little bit more metallic and foiled I
recommend dipping your brush into the
eyeshadow first and then spring fix+
so you don't mess up your eyeshadow but
yes that is what I did now I took the
shade semi-sweet in the palette and on a
skinnier not skinnier but like smaller
blending brush I am just buffing this
into my crease because I wanted the
amaretto to blend nicely into my
transition shade so I'm just using that
to blend all the colors together and
then I took a big fluffy brush and
blended some more you know no harsh
lines
I'm going into the shade cherry cordial
it's such a pretty like matte reddish
color but it does have a little bit of
glitter doesn't really translate on the
lid much but it is stunning I love it so
I'm just packing that on to the outer
corners of my eyes and then dragging it
into my crease a little bit so I took
this essence smoky kohl eyeliner in
black and I'm just using this on my
waterline and then I went back into the
cherry cordial shade that matte red and
I am buffing this on my lower lash line
this is so pretty on the lower lash line
I just I love red shades like this so
with a pencil brush this is a morphe
pencil brush I am just buffing that on
my lash line so pretty
I love it then I went into hazelnut this
color is so beautiful it's like a warm
bronzer shade I'm just buffing that on
my lower lash line so that it's not too
harsh under there and it's not like just
a line of cherry cordial that makes
sense yeah I just mix it in with a
little bit hazelnut now I went into this
essence kohl again and I'm applying this
really really really close to my top
lashes and then blending it out with a
pencil brush just to create a little bit
of smokiness right at the base of the
lashes but I didn't want to apply
eyeliner that's a good little trick so
now I'm going to highlight my brow bone
and my inner corners I'm using champagne
truffle on my inner corners and then I
used white chocolate underneath my brow
bone so I went in with some mascara I
use the Elizabeth Mott it's still big
mascara and then I applied some Ardell
whispies in the shade 6:02
on my lashes it's a very natural false
lash which is what I wanted and like
before I have already foundation
concealer and powder on but I'm going to
show you the extra steps I took I'm
taking my Physicians Formula butter
bronzer and I'm not really contouring
i'm just really warming up my face I'm
using the Too Faced mr.right brush it's
like a tulip shaped brush it's amazing
so just warming up the skin you know you
know the drill I took my Too Faced love
blush in the shade baby love I didn't
you the blush like the actual blush but
it's just a really pretty nude color and
then to highlight my face I'm using the
makeup revolution baked highlighter in
the shade radiant lights it's kind of
like a soft pinky highlight but it's so
natural and beautiful I love it so
inexpensive this is a great highlight so
I'm just highlighting my face with that
and then for my lip I'm taking the
colour-pop ultra satin lip in the shade
magic wand it's probably my favorite
ultra satin lip they have it's so
natural and perfect for everyday it goes
with so many looks and I've been loving
this formula so I just applied that to
my entire lips no lipliner or anything
and then that completes look number 2
