a battle of the concealers video so I'd
know if the lighting is weird I'm
filming this at 9:24 a.m. I never filmed
this early but I have a hundred things I
have to do today so excuse the lighting
the sun is shining so bright through my
windows right now as you can see I've
got the Sun my skin so if it looks a
little washed out I'm sorry but anyway
today we are going to be comparing these
two concealers this is the new Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof a full
coverage concealer I tried this out for
the first time in my last video and I
really didn't think anything of it I was
just like on another concealer that's
not gonna match up to my tape shape
shape tape can't see I was like oh
whatever it's probably not as good but
when I tried it on I was like blown away
it was so good so I really want to put
it to the test I actually want to
compare it to the heart-shaped tape I
want to see which one's better which one
lasts better which one looks better I'm
gonna be wearing it throughout the
entire day like I said it's 9 a.m. and I
have a long day I actually have to go to
brunch with my friends my friend Melissa
is literally about to pop she's pregnant
and she's about to pop any day now so
we're having like a girl's brunch before
she pops and my other really really
close friend Stephanie is gonna be there
as well and she's also pregnant not
about to pop but she's close anyway so
I'm gonna go do that and then I have to
go to my dad's house and then I have to
go to my aunts house so I will come back
at the end of the day and I will show
you what my undereyes look like after so
many hours cuz I imagine I'll be back
home like at 9 p.m. I don't even think
I've worn my shape tape for that long
but anyway I'm gonna apply the
all-nighter concealer on one side and
then the shape tape on the other and
then we will compare them and we will
see how they wear throughout the day I
will do maybe like one check-in I
already have my foundation on I am
wearing the Dior air flash shawl nation
I'm still testing this out because I
thought this was breaking me out but now
I'm not so sure so I've been putting it
to the test the past couple of days
that's why I keep using it I'm gonna
take the tart sheet tape but I'm gonna
play it to this eye I'm also gonna be
using this kind of like an eye primer
and a little goes a long way with this
concealer you don't need to apply a lot
which I'm sure you guys know but the
Tarte shaped tape is really
full-coverage really lightweight doesn't
feel too thick
blends right into the skin but looks
flawless
it doesn't really crease that much
really I have nothing negative to say
about this heart concealer it's the best
I've ever used and on this side I'm
gonna apply the all nighter waterproof
full-coverage concealer in the shade
light warm
I like the applicator better on the
Tarte one like I like that giant I don't
know why I applied so much I really
don't know why I like this fat doe foot
applicator the Urban Decay one is more
matte it's I think more full coverage
this one is a little paler in terms of
color but I wouldn't recommend applying
the urban decay one on both eyes and
then blending them out because by the
time you get to the other eye it will
dry down and it will be difficult to
blend so make sure you are blending this
immediately and if you do that you will
get a really pretty flawless like full
coverage look I'm gonna apply a little
bit more of the Tarte shape tape just
cuz I feel like I applied more Urban
Decay before I set my under eyes I want
to zoom you in just so you can see as of
right now I don't know which one I like
more I oh my gosh I have no idea they
look so similar to me I want to lean
towards the Tarte shape tape just a
little bit this side is just a hair more
natural but let me zoom you in I don't
even know if you guys are gonna be able
to tell they look so similar these
concealers are very various
I honestly thought I was gonna be able
to see a difference but I can't maybe
that's why I loved the Urban Decay one
so much as soon as I tried it out I was
like ah so pretty
they're both flawless they both feel
really lightweight the Urban Decay one
is just a little bit more matte it dries
a lot quicker you have to blend this one
out a lot faster but they both have a
similar effect
I think the Urban Decay one has a hair
more coverage but I don't know anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and set my under eye
can see there with the same powder on
both eyes this is the glossy a water
it's my favorite powder and then I'm
just gonna finish up the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back okay so
I am done with my makeup it is 954 I
actually have to head out in a few
minutes but after starting my concealer
and doing the rest of my makeup my under
eyes look exactly the same to me so
honestly I feel like at the moment I
don't have anything negative to say
about the urban decay one I really love
how flawless it looks reminds me a lot
of the Tarte shaped tape except for
those little things I mentioned and yeah
let's see what my under eyes look like
at the end of the day alright so I was
planning on doing check-ins throughout
this baby yo but while I was at brunch
with my friends I realized I didn't take
my camera with me I was so upset when I
realized that so I couldn't do a
check-in but it is currently 9 p.m. and
I think I finished my makeup like at 10
a.m. so the concealers have been on my
face for 11 hours and honestly I don't
know which side I prefer I stick by my
claim that they both look pretty much
the same but I was leaving brunch though
I did ask my friend Stephanie we were
like walking to her car I was like okay
I'm testing out the concealers which
side is better and she stood there for a
while like she analyzed my under eyes
and she actually said that the Urban
Decay side looked a little bit smoother
which shocked me a little bit I thought
she was gonna say the tart side and then
when I got home I asked Danny and he
said that they both looked identical he
said he could not see a difference at
all and I kind of put him on the spot I
was like no twos if you had to choose
and he also pointed to the urban decay
side so I don't know when I told her I
was like oh my god that's a sight
Stephanie chose he was like yeah but no
they both look identical like he didn't
want to pick it over the Tarte one it
was like no they both look the same I
just thought it was strange that they
both pick the urban decay side but
honestly it look
my undereyes they look exactly the same
to me the only thing I would say
honestly if I had to pick I think maybe
the tart shape tape side looks a little
bit less makeup e then the urban decay
side
I feel like obviously it's been on my
face for over 10 hours so it started to
collect a little bit here I always have
that issue with concealers the Tarte one
is doing that as well but I think that
the urban decay one is doing that a
little bit more and honestly that's the
only thing I see
by the way ignore my nails this hand has
no nail polish when I get really anxious
I chipped off my nail polish that was a
little anxious today but anyway let me
zoom you in this is the urban decay side
and this is now this is the Tarte side I
think they both look so similar but
anyway guys that completes this video I
really wanted to put both of these to
the test and I feel like they both did a
great job they lasted all day and I
highly recommend both of them I think
this is definitely the closest we've
gotten to tape shave tape this is giving
it a run for its money for sure 100% I
think that if you have oily skin you
might even prefer this one because it's
a little bit more matte than this one so
I'm so excited about this can't wait to
use it more I guess it just depends
which one you want they're both just
very similar this is a very close battle
well done guys well done let me know if
there's any other battle of the some
things you want to see I don't know if
