hey guys so I'm currently in a storm the
power has almost gone out like four
times so I'm like hanging by a string
right now hoping that the power doesn't
get cut off so that at least this lamp
can illuminate me somewhat but today's
video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup
I'm wearing right now
it was perfectly sunny when I started
doing this tutorial then halfway through
it it started to pour like a mother and
like my power almost went out like I
said and it was just it's and I would
have just stopped recording it would
have filmed this tomorrow but I was
already like doing my makeup and I was
like they're my peeps my subscribers are
my peeps they're not gonna care if it's
a little dark they never do because I'm
always complaining about it and you guys
are really nice about it
huh it was an epic lightning note and I
was waiting for the Thunder but fairness
way I wanted to do a really deep smoky
eye like suitable for clubbing and stuff
like that but since it is summertime I
wanted to incorporate color as well so
it is very dark and dramatic and klemish
but it's also colorful too but not your
basic like a deep black silver look it's
kind of fun it has like a twist to it
colorful I like it anyway if you want to
see a tutorial on this makeup look then
you can go ahead and keep watching so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to prime my eyes I am using Urban
Decay's primer potion and then I'm going
to take a piece of scotch tape put on
the back of my hand first and then put
it right next to my eye to create like a
sharp cat eye effect I am taking my
Urban Decay Naked basics palette and I'm
taking the color called naked 2 I
believe it's called and I am just going
to be applying this in my crease buffing
this color in dipping my brush in little
by little and just building up that
color this is just going to work as a
transition shade so that everything
blends well then I'm going to take my
NYX jumbo pencil in black bean I'm going
to put this all over my lid and then
blend it out with my finger
for this tutorial I am using the Urban
Decay electric palette I'm going to take
the little brush that comes to the
palette and I'm dipping it into the
color freak and I'm going to apply this
to the inner part of my eye just
focusing it mainly near the tear ducts
area
then I'm going to take this color right
here it is called fringe is a beautiful
teal and on the other side of the brush
I'm going to apply this to my entire lid
and putting black as a base is really
going to make this eyeshadow stand out
it's going to make it like a deep
seafoam teal kind of color I don't know
I really love how this looks right on
top of black so yeah I'm just applying
this to my whole lid right up to the
crease then I'm gonna take a fluffy
brush with no additional product and I'm
just going to start blending out those
edges
then I'm going to take a Mac 217 brush
and dip it into naked 2 from the Urban
Decay basics palette and I'm going to
start blending this out even more this
is the type of look that does look kind
of ugly and messy before it starts to
look pretty but don't worry about it
just keep trucking and keep blending and
it'll all turn out just fine
I'm going to take this one right here
called feint and I'm just gonna blend
some more like I said this is a lot a
lot of blending because the colors are
so vibrant and pigmented you want to
make sure you blend them out nicely then
I'm going to go back into the fluffy
brush and just blend out the harsh edges
and then because of all that blending
some of the color did go away obviously
so I'm just going to take that fringe
color again and apply it to my entire
lid and then I'm going to do the same
with the Freak color now with my Mac 217
I'm actually dipping it into the color
fringe which is the blue one we put on
the entire lid and I'm going to add some
of this to my crease
and then a fluffy brush with no
additional product and just blending
some more lots and lots of blending to
highlight I am going to take the
highlight shade in The Naked basics
palette and apply it underneath my brow
bone and in my inner tear-duct
I'm going to create a thin wing and I am
using the balms
shewing eyeliner and it's really good to
use tape when it comes to doing a wing
because it's foolproof and it's really
really easy the tape is going to act as
a guide line so you just want to add a
wing and even though it looks messy when
you take the tape off it's nice and
sharp so I'm just going to add a thin
little wing
then I'm going to take my Maybelline
message on my eyeliner as always and I'm
going to tightline with this
I'm going to take a flat shader brush
and I'm going to take the black and the
naked basics palette and I'm going to
start packing this really really close
to the tape I want it to be the darkest
right at the edge of the tape so I'm
just going to pack that color and then
start dragging it towards the inner part
of my eye so it's nice and faded add the
color little by little so it's not too
harsh then I'm just going to take off
the tape and you see it's nice and sharp
and with a white B I'm just going to
clean up any fallout moving on to my
face I'm using the chafing relief powder
gel and I'm going to use this as a
primer yes it is from honest ATS but
it's silicone base and it's good for
your pores and stuff so that's what I'm
using for my foundation I am using my
L'Oreal true match foundation in three
natural buff and my trusty handy dandy
Real Techniques sponge I keep forgetting
what this is called I think it's like a
miracle complexion sponge I'm not I
don't remember but seriously guys this
sponge is amazing if you don't own it
already I recommend it it's very
affordable it's very comparable to the
Beauty Blender and I love it
I'm going to move on to concealer and I
am using my Maybelline fit me concealer
and 15 fair and I'm just gonna apply
this underneath my eyes to cover my dark
circles and to highlight a little bit I
always do this step but you know the
usual I'm not very careful when I do
this I just make sure that my under eye
area is nice and concealed and
highlighted and then I'm going to first
blend it out with the sponge and then
I'm going to further blend it out with
my Real Techniques contour brush
to set it I'm going to use my Mac
emphasized powder and this is just going
to set the concealer so that it does not
crease so moving on to the eyes again
I'm going to take my Maybelline master
drama eyeliner in Midnight Master and
I'm going to use this on my waterline
then I'm going to take this faint color
again and I'm going to run this
underneath my lower lash line all the
way to my inner tear duct and I'm sorry
it is really dark this is when it
started pouring like crazy so again I
apologize I'm going to add some mascara
to my top and bottom lashes this is the
Clinique lash doubling mascara and then
I'm going to apply my red cherry lashes
in 7 4 7 M or yeah 7 4 7 M I love these
lashes they're amazing so yeah then I'm
gonna smell my bronzer apparently this
is the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer it smells like chocolate and
it's really good and I am just going to
apply this all over my face contouring a
little bit just bronzing up my face this
bronzer is so pigmented that
you can get pretty heavy pretty quickly
so just use it like hand with it I'm
using my ELF complexion brush I believe
that's what it's called and then I'm
just going to apply this to my neck and
underneath my chin as well for blush I
am using my NYX blush in the shade mauve
and it's a nice Mavi pinky color it's
really really pretty and it's light for
my highlight I'm using the balms
mary-lou manizer and I am using my Sigma
contour brush to apply this on my
cheekbones I'm also going to apply this
to the bridge of my nose and on my
Cupid's bow as well
for my lips I am using the NYX butter
lipstick in the shade and I am applying
this to my lips and then I'm going to
top it off with buxom lipgloss in white
Russian
I love this combination it gives it like
a nice milky glossy pink I really like
it so that is the end of this tutorial
