hey guys so today's video is another
tutorial using the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette I said that I would do a couple
of tutorials using this palette so this
is look numero dos it's a pretty dark
bold smoky eye this is perfect for a
night out on the town and this look
definitely calls for false lashes like
it would look absolutely beautiful with
false lashes but I'm not a false lashes
expert guys know I'm not very good with
false lashes I just I never wear them I
just use like a very thick volumizing
mascara and it does the job I mean I'm
just really happy with the way that this
turned out I'm actually really really
loving this palette and I don't know if
I should say this yet I'm not gonna okay
I'm gonna say it I might like this more
than my naked 2 palette I haven't had it
long enough to say that but I'm really
loving the undertones in these
eyeshadows so much more than I thought I
would by the way I do not do my entire
face in this tutorial you probably can't
tell but I'm like getting the flu I just
know I know it's coming and I know that
people are mainly worried about the
eyeshadows not what's on the rest of my
face but everything that is on the rest
of my face right now will be in the
description box so if you're interested
in like lip color or something just
check down there cuz it'll be there okay
I'm going to stop talking out by the way
thumbs up this video if you want to see
more naked 3 palette tutorials the first
thing I'm going to do is take my Urban
Decay primer potion because the base I'm
going to use
can kind of slip off if I don't have a
primer which is this this is the NYX
jumbo pencil in the color black bean I'm
just going to line it really close to my
lash line and then just blend it up with
my fingers but I'm not going to be
taking it past the crease now I'm taking
this color right here called nooner and
I'm going to be buffing this into my
crease I really just want to blend out
that black base we put down and a lot of
the black is just going to blend away as
you can see it starts like coming off
but I do go back and add some more black
to them to the spots that kind of
disappeared now I'm taking the color
limit and I'm just going to add this to
my crease as well and just make
everything nice and blended now I'm
taking the color dark side and just
going to go all over the lid but I'm not
really going to take it pass it free so
I'm just going to be putting it up to
the crease
and right here I'm just cleaning because
this kind of has a little bit of fallout
so I'm just cleaning it up and getting
like a nice little sharp edge now I'm
taking the color layer and I'm going to
be buffing this into my crease this is
just going to blend it really nicely
from that dark side color to the matte
shades in the crease I really like how
it looks even though it is a shimmery
color and then I'm taking burnout and
I'm going to be doing the exact same
thing for some reason I just think that
these colors look really pretty together
and like I don't know it's a good nice
little transition then I'm taking my
master drama eyeliner in Midnight master
and I'm going to line my waterline and
then for my brow bone highlight I am
just taking the color strange and I'm
putting that in my tear duct as well and
then I'm just adding some eyeliner to
make that little winged liner and I do
it off camera because they have to get
super close to the mirror and then you
just not be able to see me then I'm
taking the color liar and I'm just going
to buff this underneath my lower lash
line just to kind of smoke it out and
then I'm going to soften the outer edges
of that wing with that same eyeshadow
and then I'm just going to pack on the
mascara this Tesoro is super quick and
easy anybody could do it even a beginner
so I really hope you enjoyed thank you
so much for watching guys please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
