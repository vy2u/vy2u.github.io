tutorial on these rolls gold eyes it's
very very fast and simple it's a daytime
appropriate so the first thing I'm going
to do is prime my eyelids and then I'm
going to take the color limit and I'm
going to buff this into my crease
I'm going back and forth with this I
really want this color to show up in my
crease I have a cold
like I sound horrible now I'm taking
this color right here called trick and
that is the really pretty rose gold
shade in the palette it's probably my
favorite eyeshadow but as you can see
the pigmentation isn't the best so I'm
just going to take some fix+ spray that
on my brush and then apply this to my
lids and the fix+
really really intensifies the eyeshadow
and just makes it look like literally
rose gold and it gives it like a nice
Sheen to it I love how it looks with
some fix+
you can even use like eyedrops sir yeah
then I'm taking the color nooner and
then I'm just packing this onto my outer
V and then I'm bringing this into the
crease I wanted to be like nice and
diffused and blown out that nooner shade
is so beautiful so I'm packing a lot of
that into my crease then I'm taking the
color factory and I'm gonna put this
underneath my lower lashes oh why am i
sick I hope I'm sorry that these are all
voiceovers but it's just I don't know
then I'm going to take nooner that shade
I used in my crease and then blend out
my lower lash line as well I'm taking
the lightest shade in the palette and
this is going to be my brow bone
highlight and my inner corner highlight
then adding some morphix blush on my fix
plus on my brush I'm going to pack some
of that trick color onto the inner part
of my eye on the bottom lash line just
to brighten it up a little bit then I'm
just adding some mascara and that's
pretty much it for the eyes I didn't
want to add eyeliner or winged liner or
anything like that since this is a
daytime look and for my face I wanted to
give it very very very simple so
honestly I just bronze my face a little
bit using some Physicians Formula
bronzer and that's I didn't contour
anything just warmed up my cheeks a
little bit
for my lips I'm using this Maybelline
nude lipstick in blushing beige that I
got recently and I swear it's like the
most beautiful nude color in the world
but I thought it was just like a little
bit too nude not too nude but I just
wanted it a little bit more pink so I
took the Maybelline colored whisper and
petal rebel and I just dabbed that on
top just to give it a more pinky nude
color and that's pretty much it like I
said it was super quick thank you so
much for watching guys and I'll see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
