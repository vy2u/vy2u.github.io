a battle of the makeup palettes type of
video I asked you guys on Twitter if you
wanted to see this video or if you
wanted to see a foundation wear test
review kind of thing on the news you a
buy coverage cream foundation and 60% of
you voted for this video and 40% of you
voted for these you a video so obviously
I went with this one but then I realized
you know what I'm not gonna do a first
impressions on the jus a foundation I'm
gonna wear it a few times really test it
out and then I'll do a review if you
guys really want to see that so leave me
a comment down below if you want to see
like a full review on the joy foundation
I'm actually wearing it right now and
honestly based on first impressions I
think I really like it I prepped my skin
really well and I used the Beauty
Blender and all of that but anyway if
you want to see that video definitely
let me know down below anyway moving on
to this video ever since the Tarte
tartlet toasted palette came out I've
gotten so many comments messages just
asking for my opinion on this palette
and whether I think it's better the same
not as good as the Urban Decay Naked
heat palette since they are both
extremely extremely similar palettes
what I consider these dupes absolutely
not like absolutely not they're also
very different and we will get into that
I'm going to show you guys swatches I'm
gonna swatch all the colors and we're
just gonna decide right here right now
you and I you and I I'm gonna help you
out because I know I know you clicked on
this video because you're deciding which
one you want to buy should you go with
the Tarte one the Urban Decay one like
you don't know you just don't know and
I'm gonna help you so let's do this
so a lot of you guys know the Urban
Decay Naked heat palette did release
first and you get 12 eyeshadows and it
retails for $54 and the back of the
pilot says you get 1.3 grams like net
weight and then each eyeshadow has point
zero 5 ounces and then for the tartlet
toasted palette you get 12 i shadow x'
as well but this one retails for 46
dollars and the net weight is 1.5 grams
and the eyeshadows are point zero 53 I'm
not even gonna pretend like I know
anything about grams and all of that but
I know a lot of you guys always ask for
that so I just wanted to include it so
the toasted palette is a bit cheaper the
Urban Decay one does come with a brush
but I feel like I don't
not everybody loves using the brushes
that come in with the pallets I would
prefer to pay a little bit less and to
remove the brush but that's just me I
know there are a ton of people who love
the brushes in The Naked palette so
that's just my personal opinion now I'm
gonna go through all the swatches with
you guys and then at the end I will give
you like my thoughts on everything and
which one is more worth it to me if you
had to pick just one because I think
it's okay to have both but I know not
everybody is nutso like me so if you had
to pick one let's get into some swatches
so the heat palette has to highlight
e.type shades just like the Tarte one so
in that aspect they're very similar
you get ounce and chaser from the Urban
Decay Naked heat palette pounds is more
of like a satin finish it has a little
bit of a sheen while chaser is a
complete matte I don't really get to use
chaser all that often because it is so
similar to my skin tone so I don't
really get use out of that but I really
do like Alice for the brow bone and then
in the toasted palette the two highlight
shades you get our s'more and sunrise
s'more being the matte shade and sunrise
is more of a satin finish very similar
to Alice but it's a bit more yellow and
I love both of these shades I think all
four of these eyeshadows are great it
just depends on your skin tone and what
works for you okay so now I'm going to
compare the mattes in both palettes
because I don't want to go in the exact
order of each shadow because they're
placed differently so now I'm just gonna
compare all the mattes together together
together and then come on almost drop
that what I need to do is get it
together okay so I'm gonna swatch all
the mattes compare them and then I'll go
into the shimmer shades okay so from the
naked heat palette we have sauced low
blow
key devil Cayenne and foil and ashes now
this is actually what I really love
about the Urban Decay Naked heat palette
I love that all these matte shades are
very very deep and rich I love how
samokhin you can get with this palette
it is amazing for that and now for the
in the toasted palette you have Kashmir
warmth cozy latte and fireside so for
these they aren't as smokey and as deep
as the Urban Decay Naked heat palette
you can't have like more medium toned
shades here the only one that's very
deep is fireside versus the heat pallet
you kind of have n Fuego and ashes
they're both very deep so in terms of
just color alone
comparing the palettes it really just
depends on what you prefer if you like
the deeper smokier darker shades and you
would definitely prefer the urban decay
palette if you're someone who likes to
have lighter crease shades as well then
you might like the Tarte palette a
little bit more even though there's one
more matte in the heat palette Cayenne
and and foil are actually very very
similar this is just my personal
preference but I really love that the
Tarte one has the shade warmth because
it is a very very like orangie crease
shade and it just warms up the entire
look I really love that eye shadow and I
also really love latte in terms of
crease colors like the ones that I'm
gonna initially put in my crease first I
do like the ones in the Tarte one a
little bit more than these in the heat
pallet by the way at the end of this
video I will be doing more swatches of
just two colors side by side like one
from the heat palette 1 from the toasted
palette like the ones that are as close
to dupes as they can get just so you can
see them side by side I will like add
that in the end for you guys but anyway
let's jump into the shimmer shades I
feel like this is where I made my
decision of which one I like better so
besides that satin shade that they both
have let's talk about the best of the
shimmers so in The Naked heat palette
you have lumber which is such a unique
shade by the way I love that one then
you have dirty talk also gorgeous
scorched and ember which is also amazing
so you have those 4 shimmer shades and
then in the Tarte palette you have 5 so
you have sunset you have crackle which
to me I would consider this honestly a
matte I use it more as a matte so
technically I feel like they both have
the same amount of mattes and shimmers
in my personal opinion but I mean I
can't deny the obvious glitter in this
eyeshadow so we are gonna call it a
shimmer then you have flame candle and
simmer okay so as you can see the
shimmer shades are
pretty different the only ones that are
similar are dirty top and flame flame is
just a little bit more coppery and dirty
talk is a little bit pinkier but all the
other shadows are pretty different I
will say lumber really just has my heart
the dual chrome in it is so pretty and
so reflective I love it but sunset from
the Tarte palette is one of the
prettiest eyeshadows I've ever seen
every time I use this palette I feel
like that's the color that always goes
on my eyes I feel like you get more of a
variety because not only do you get like
that warm reddish color but you do get
the golds but the urban decay heat
palette does have that deep chocolate
shimmer shade it really honestly just
depends you just have to see which
shades would look better on your lid and
which colors just complement your skin
tone the best just depends on your
preference now let's talk about
performance and formula and packaging
and all the other stuff besides just
colors so I love the packaging on the
early Decay Naked Heat I think it's
really pretty
I've never had problems traveling with
the naked palettes I really like them I
like that you clothes look like they're
pretty good and it also has a mirror
like this the packaging on the toasted
palette in my opinion is just a little
bit better not in terms of cuteness
they're both very cute but I always
reach for this mirror when I'm doing my
makeup and I never reach for the mirror
in this one it's just harder to see
yourself on this like rectangle thing it
cuts off your forehead and your chin
especially my forehead because it's a
fivehead
while with this palette my whole face my
whole face is in this square you know I
know that's like a really dumb thing but
I use the mirror all the time and I just
I prefer this style with packaging it's
very thin and easy to travel with so I'm
just trying to like nitpick at things
you know just in case I want to hit all
the topics also all of these tartlet
palettes smell really delicious
like really delicious and as you're
applying it to your eye like you smell
it and it's a nice delicious experience
the Urban Decay one smells like regular
eyeshadows yeah just no scent I know
that means nothing to like 90% of you
but I think this is a nice little touch
do I think they totally stole that idea
from Too Faced possibly
because it smells like the chocolate bar
pallets but regardless it's nice now in
terms of formula and quality and which
eyeshadows I think perform better
they're close but I think I prefer just
I think I prefer the tart eyeshadows
just a little bit more which is crazy
because I was such a diehard Naked
palette fan I still AM it's such a good
palette like ember I love this shadow I
wore it to the Urban Decay Naked heat
event I wore this all over my entire lid
on like a amazing deep smoky I was like
really intense and like chocolatey and
shimmery and beautiful but I just love
how creamy these eyeshadows are they
blend a little bit better and how easily
they blend I just I prefer the formula
on the tartlet palettes a little bit
more except the original Tarte lip
palette because I don't like that
palette at all the only eyeshadow that's
a little sketchy in this palette and not
even sketchy it's just very crumbly it's
this one in candle the only way I can
use this eyeshadow is if I use it with
my fingers but once you do use it with
your fingers you get like a really
pretty intense application it's what I
have on my inner corners right now I
love using this shadow on my inner
corners would like my pinky cuz it's
like BAM in your face but it is super
crumbly like don't even try to apply
this eyeshadow with a brush anyway I
think I touched all topics packaging
formula price colors I think they're
both great palettes if I had to pick
just one because I know you guys are
gonna ask me if I had to pick just one
which one have I used more often and
which one do I find myself thinking
about and just wanting to reach for it's
this one it's the toasted palette and
not because it's new but because I feel
like for my skin tone and for what I'm
looking for in a palette this is just a
little bit more versatile for me because
you get great light shades and then you
get great deep shades and even though
this one is full of glitter you could
apply it with glitter or you could tap
off your brush and apply to the eyes and
it works like a dark chocolate matte
eyeshadow but honestly I think whatever
decision you make they're both really
great palettes do I think they're
different enough that you absolutely
need them both like no you will not
survive without either or you need them
both no I think you could look at one
and be like okay I'm gonna get
that this one a little bit more let me
go with this one I don't think you need
them both but if I personally had to
choose the tartlet palette once it does
I can't lie and this video is not
sponsored by the way if any one of my
videos is sponsored I will say it in the
very beginning I will verbally tell you
I get a lot of comments is this radio
sponsored but trust me if I don't say it
it's not much but anyway this is the one
I choose as my winner I just think when
you see both palettes and you get the
big picture and you compare like price
packaging formula and all of that this
one wins anyway you guys leave me a
comment down below letting me know which
one you're gonna pick up if you're
deciding on like which one you want
which one are you gonna get or are you
not gonna get any of them and you're
just watching this video because you're
bored then in that case I understand so
yeah guys really quickly I'm gonna go
into side-by-side swatches of each shade
let's roll that really quick
anyway I hope that part was kind of
helpful as well but that completes this
video guys I hope you enjoyed thank you
