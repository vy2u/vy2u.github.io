a little haul for you guys I was at Ulta
earlier today and I haven't posted a
haul video in like two or three months
something like that and it's just
because I don't typically go out
somewhere and buy a bunch of things at
once you know to make a haul video I'll
just buy something one day and then a
couple days later like couple weeks
later buy something else that's kind of
how I do my shopping I just don't go and
buy a bunch of things at once at least I
don't usually do that but today I did
buy a few things at once and they are
things that I'm really excited about
like I said I didn't go absolutely crazy
at Ulta but I did buy a couple of things
that I have had my eye on for a while
anyway I picked up the Jerkins natural
blue daily moisturizer and this is the
one from medium to tan skin tones I had
the one that was from like fair to
medium or like for light skin tones and
I hated it it even made its debut in one
of my products I regret buying videos
but I didn't hate the product I just
hated the color the one that's her light
skin tones just didn't show up on my
skin at all and I was putting it on for
like two weeks and it was barely
noticeable and when it was it kind of
looked a little bit orange like a little
bit too orange for my liking so I picked
up this one because this one obviously
it's a lot stronger because it's for a
medium to tan skin tones and it gives
you more of a bronzed look than an
orange look and now since it's not
summer anymore I really don't feel like
self-tanning as much like with the
actual color tan and getting all dirty
and getting all sticky like I'm just not
up for that right now so I picked up
this because it's a cream and it gives
you a gradual tan and it's not messy or
streaky and it doesn't stick to my skin
and actually sinks into my skin pretty
nicely and it doesn't
that disgusting smell so yeah anyway I
picked up a couple of haircare products
let me explain first okay you guys know
that I had light hair and then something
happened where it went completely dark
what it wasn't supposed to I was trying
to go lighter than when I was and I
ended up being darker Lola well long
story short is that I'm trying to get
back to my color actually no I'm trying
to go blonde like full-on blonde and I
know that every single one of you liked
my brown hair it's just I've had brown
hair for 21 years and I'm kind of sick
of it I just I want to be blonde for a
little while um I just I don't know I
want to have light hair I'm curious I
want to go a lot so right now I'm you
know gradually going blonde and it is a
process it's really hard to go blonde
from dark brown hair without damaged so
I'm trying to do it as best as I can
though right now um this is what's going
on I look like a damn tiger I have like
brown hair and then like the gold colors
it's just like I look like a tiger
there's stripes all over my hair which
is probably why I would have my hair in
a bun for like two weeks because I don't
like the look of highlights like the
thickness but I had to do it like that
because I couldn't you know put
highlights on my entire head without
like completely messing it up so the
going blonde process is gonna be ugly
for a little while it's gonna be ugly so
bear with me if you see my hair in a bun
in 90% of my videos I'm sorry it just it
you know it's a struggle guys it's a
struggle with that being said I do have
deep conditioners that I already own and
loved but I did want to branch out and
try out the products that people really
love for their hair so I picked up the
it's kind of like a sample of the
diamond oil deep facets from red ken
it's the oil enriched intensive
treatment for damaged hair I really want
to get this like in the tub form because
I heard that this is anime
using deep conditioner especially for
like if you use bleach on your hair or
if it's color treated and stuff like
that
I heard it's amazing but I wanted to
give it a try this was like four dollars
I wanted to give it a try before I went
and invested the $20 in it but hopefully
I love it I love red ken wreckin is
amazing so I hope I love this diamond
oil deep facets I also picked up the
L'Oreal total repair 5 multi restorative
dry oil
it says instant repair and shine
nourishes conditions lightweight dry oil
for all hair types I picked this up
because the total repair 5 line is like
my favorite drugstore shampoo and deep
conditioner and stuff like that I think
it's amazing and I've heard so many good
things about this even people with oily
hair love it it just gives you hear like
really intense shine and since it's a
dry oil it's not greasy whatsoever so I
really wanted it to give my hair some
shine because light hair can look you
know a little not not as shiny as dark
hair but yeah so hopefully I really
loved this because I've heard amazing
things okay and the last haircare
product I bought kind of hurts me a
little because I've been wanting it for
so long that is so damn expensive and it
is the it's a 10 miracle leave-in
product I've heard countless things
about this like oh my god it really is a
miracle even product it's amazing it
does ten things for you it repairs dry
damaged hair adds shine detangles
controls frizz seals and protects hair
color prevents split ends stops hair
breakage creates silkiness enhances
natural body and it is a thermal
protector so this damn thing this is not
this is not very big it's kind of
matches me but anyway this is not very
big this was I want to save almost $15
or yeah I think it was almost $15 but I
decided to give it a chance because you
know doing the things that I'm doing to
my hair maybe my hair deserved it it
also came with this little thing and it
is
the miracle hair mask it's a sample of
the hair mask so I thought it was nice
that it also you know brought a little
sample to hair mask
because I love me some hair masks okay
now moving on to makeup I just picked up
the NYX soft matte lip cream in Tokyo I
am obsessed with the soft matte lip
cream I use this one all the time over
my red lipsticks this is called addis
ababa it's just like a nice fuchsia
looks beautiful on top of red lipsticks
and I just picked up this one called
Tokyo it's like a light baby pink and I
love matte lipsticks and what's amazing
about this besides the smell because it
smells like cake better
I got it smells like cooking he's like
it smell so good but besides that it's
not a drying matte lipstick like it's
not a dry texture at all it kind of
feels like satiny and like Sookie I'm
not gonna explain it but the I think
these look really nice on your lips like
even if you have chapped lips like I
feel like it goes on really smoothly and
nicely I love these things okay so while
I was at Ulta I was like okay you know
what I'm gonna give into the hype and
I'm gonna buy hoola bronzer I have been
wanting that bronzer for so long but I
have just been dodging it because I
don't think it could possibly be as good
as everyone says it is
um but today I was like you know what
just buy it just buy it I want to get
there of course hoola bronzer is
completely sold out just my look so I
was kind of bummed about that but then I
saw this sitting on the benefit counter
and it is the ultimate 66 it's just six
samples of like really popular things
from benefit and I got it because it has
the hoola bronzer right here it's the
sample of it it also comes with the stay
don't stray this is an eye primer I
think comes within that gal face primer
the bad gal lash which I have been
wanting to try out the bad gal lash
mascara for so long so I'm really happy
that that's in here too and then it
comes with posy tint and
I mean which are really popular stuff
too so I thought for the price it was
really good because it comes with a
bunch of things that I have been really
wanting to try so I hope I like it okay
so the last three things are a little
embarrassing
okay no you're not embarrassing but okay
I am the type of person that never buys
foundation like ever I have two
foundations sitting in my drawer right
now one is my summer color so I can't
even wear it and the other one is the
one that I use now but I thought I
needed to step out of the box a little
bit and start experimenting more with
foundations and believe it or not I have
never used a high-end foundation in my
life I don't think I don't think maybe
oh no way yeah I bought a Mac one that I
absolutely loved but it broke me out so
I don't have that anymore
but anyway I don't I rarely use high-end
foundations so I was like Kathleen go
get yourself a high-end foundation so
that's what I did
well not only did I buy one high-end
foundation I kind of bought three which
I know is completely ridiculous like who
goes in to look for one foundation and
comes out with three of them who does
that but I don't know I couldn't help
myself
the first one I picked up which is the
one that I originally intended on
getting is the Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation now if you watch my videos
you're thinking pretty sure you hold
that like two months ago
and you're right I absolutely did but I
had to return that one because it had a
pink undertone and I like my foundation
to have more of a yellow undertone so
when I went to go return it instead of
exchanging it for a yellowy one I bought
something else and I regretted it ever
since I was like man I really should
have exchanged it so here I am buying it
again and I got my shake well hopefully
I got my correct shade the other
foundation I picked up is also one that
I have been wanting for a while but I
have really dry skin so I have kind of
been scared to buy a powder
but after doing a lot of research I
heard that even dry skin can can wear
this and it is the bareMinerals original
foundation I even hear that people with
oily skin don't really like this too
much because it kind of has a luminosity
to it I don't know how to explain it
um there's like a definite glow to this
foundation and I don't know Bare
Minerals is just so beneficial for your
skin and I have just been really wanting
to try something that will cover enough
but will you know won't clog my pores or
just won't be too heavy on my skin so
that's why I wanted to give this a shot
hopefully it has decent amount of
coverage and I guess we'll see and then
the third foundation I got and last
thing I got at Ulta was actually it's
technically not a foundation it is the
it cosmetics bye bye redness
neutralizing correcting cream and this
thing is $32 okay this little jar is $32
but I just had to have this I just
recently found out about this and ever
since I found out about it I have been
doing crazy research I've been seeing
before and after pictures like when I
really want something but it's kind of
pricey I really do my research and it
comes in one color it's not a foundation
that comes in multiple at least on the
floor dang it like I was saying it's not
a foundation where it comes in multiple
colors it's a neutralizing like cream
and supposed to correct and get rid of
all your redness and this is
like the shaded in its supposed to be
one fits all and oh my goodness the
reviews on this product are phenomenal
this gets like five stars across the
board and if you see people's before and
after pictures like it covers everything
it covers acne scars like like really
right skin it covers everything and that
is my main problem is redness I get so
red around my nose and in between my
forehead and like my cheeks are like
super extremely red so hopefully it
doesn't cling on to my dry patches they
do say that it's good for all skin types
but I'm really hoping it works well for
my skin and the good thing is that a
little does go a long way because when I
feel this in my hand it's like I know
how to explain it it doesn't seem too
thick it seems kind of moisturizing a
little bit I don't know oh I don't know
we'll see how this goes by the way I
haven't tried any of these three
foundations on my face at all if you
want me to do a first impressions video
on any of these let me know down below
where I kind of apply it to my face tell
you my initial thoughts and then I'll
wear it throughout the day and let you
know if it like faded or if it like
broke up my makeup or anything like that
just to kind of give you like my first
my first impressions and like a review
and demo let me know if you want those
videos down below on any specific one or
if you want a video of all three of
these just comment all in the comments
and cover the letters just write all and
that that's all just that's all you're
gonna write and then I'll know to do
those videos okay so that was it that
was my little haul for you guys for my
little trip to Ulta today it was my day
off so I just wanted to go relax and
spend some money I hope you enjoyed this
video and I hope you're subscribed thank
