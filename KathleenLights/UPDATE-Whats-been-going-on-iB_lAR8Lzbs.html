know the lighting is completely off on
like super dark on this side and the Sun
is hitting me on this side but I am
outside and it's just an awkward um and
awkward lighting so I do apologize for
that but this video isn't a beauty video
or anything like that so let's ignore
the lighting issue also I'm I'm sick I
have a cold so I sound like Kermit the
Frog I feel like I've been sick for a
month every time I get off my cold
something happens and my cold comes back
anyway um oh also if you hear me birds
chirping dogs barking I'm outside
obviously but anyway this video is an
update video I really have to tell you
guys what's been going on because um I
just yeah so as a lot of you guys know
Danny my husband he is in the Navy and
unfortunately okay
unfortunately a couple of days ago he
did go on deployment he was deployed
he's going to be gone for six whole
months and it sucks um
it sucks this isn't the first
appointment he's been on this is his
fourth deployment this is our third as a
couple so I mean I've done this two
other times before but it really doesn't
get any easier I feel like it just gets
worse and worse every time he tells me
like oh hey I'm deploying so I mean it
really sucks but it comes with the job
you have to deal with it you have to get
over it you know so that's why I'm
making this update video because my
setup is going to be changing for the
next six months this is temporary I will
go back to my old setup that I know you
guys love um when these six when he
comes back from deployment god willing
so I won't be going back to that setup
in six months but for right now I am
currently in Florida as you guys know I
live in Mississippi but I came down to
Florida for six whole months to spend
time with my dad and my family and stuff
like that my friends so I'm back in
Florida and that's why my setup isn't
gonna be the same I'm actually painting
my old room I'm getting everything set
up really really nice I'm getting some
nice decorations and I'm making it look
really cute
pretty similar to what it looked like in
my house I'm trying to do my best I'm
trying to get everything set up as fast
as possible I'm hoping it will look
really nice I hope you guys understand I
hope you guys um still keep watching and
still keep subscribing because I'm
putting my best effort into this new
setup if this is not good I'm not gonna
film out here it's just that my room
isn't done yet so I had nowhere else to
film but yeah if you're wondering where
I am I don't know did I say it I'm at my
dad's house this is the house I grew up
in my entire life I lived here for 18
years before I moved out this is my
backyard is are all these plants
necessary
my dad is very very integrated so yeah I
just basically wanted to come out here
and tell you guys that I know I haven't
posted a video in about a week or so
that's why I posted my makeup collection
the other day I had pre-recorded that in
Mississippi because I knew that I was
going to be coming down here and a lot
of you guys wanted to see my vanity tour
and like makeup collection so that's why
I filmed that for you guys because
things are going to be a little bit
different here and I have a lot of
tutorials coming your way once
everything is set up nicely which it
shouldn't take too long I'm almost
startles I have a lot of fun videos in
mind I'm trying my best to occupy my
mind with YouTube and making videos and
making tutorials so that I don't cry
myself to sleep every night because
because it can get a little devastating
last inflation did not go well for me I
did I was really sad all the time like
all the time so I'm trying to occupy my
mind with you guys now I get to play
with two puppies instead of one this is
TV my dad's dog um
excuse her haircut it's a really long
story but at least Cornelius has a
friend cuz he's actually like really sad
um he cried when Danny left like he sat
in the car he sobbed for a little while
like he was really sad mm-hmm
so I mean at least he has a friend it
just kind of sucks like picker picker
but a bug just flew on my face okay it
sucks because like picture your best
friend in the entire world like the
person you tell everything to like your
best friend you hang out with them every
single day and then it's like bye I'm
leaving for six months and you're like
what
do any now
so yeah I just quickly wanted to update
you on my life and what's going on right
now which is which is why
so yeah I hope you guys well I mean
there's nothing to enjoy about this
video it's not a very happy video but
like I said my main what I'm really
concerned about is that you guys just
keep watching and then you just kind of
like stay subscribed and stay beside me
while I get everything organized and you
know I'm able to post a lot of videos
and do a lot of stuff it will be on like
Donkey Kong like Oh more videos than
I've ever posted in my life and then
those of you who are like man you don't
post enough anymore are gonna be like
okay that's enough stuff stop posting so
much I'm gonna stop rambling Cornelius
and I are here to say goodbye so yeah
stay tuned for my next video it's coming
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
