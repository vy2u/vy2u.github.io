my updated affordable brush favorites
video I did this video like two years
ago and while I still absolutely love
every single brush I talked about there
has just been so many new releases from
the drugstore or I've just discovered
more drugstore brushes or affordable
with that being said I'm not going to
mention any of the ones I mentioned in
my last video because I don't want it to
be too long or too repetitive so I will
definitely link that video down below in
case you haven't seen it I still love
all of those brushes I use all of those
brushes all the time and they are my top
favorites as well today I'm going to be
sharing with you the brushes that have
been added to the favorites family
surprisingly enough I only have 5 eye
brushes to talk about and technically
two of them come together it's a little
set but I do have nine face brushes to
talk about I have just been loving
affordable face brushes I don't know I
hadn't discovered this brush when I did
my last video because if not this
totally would have been included
actually I think this brush released
after I film that this is the elf crease
brush and if I'm gonna be honest there's
a lot of elf brushes in this video just
because I think they make the best
drugstore brushes like out of all the
brands I've tried at the drugstore they
make the best ones this is the elf
crease brush like I said I love this
brush because it's like a fluffy
blending brush in a miniature size this
is perfect for those of you who have
really small eyelids where sometimes you
feel like traditional blending brushes
are just too large for your crease I
would really look into this personally I
love this because I'll go in with a
bigger brush and kind of add my
transition shade with that but then I'll
dip this into a darker color and really
focus that in my crease and I love how
precise this brush is so totally a
favorite this is also another oldie but
it's definitely a goodie this is the
Real Techniques dome shadow brush I
featured a lot of Real Techniques in my
last video and I don't think I had ever
used this before that video this is so
great for creme eyeshadow I had
struggled for a really long time to find
the perfect brush at the drugstore that
can apply cream eyeshadow flawlessly I
can use this with any cream product and
it's perfect the Maybelline Color
tattoos Mac Paint Pots even colored eye
primer like the
Kat Von D 1 any consistency like that
this really does a great job of blending
and buffing that onto your lid awesome
brush for that totally you totally need
this I think it comes in a set but Real
Techniques brushes I mean they're all
great I love them all my next brush is a
classic fluffy blending brush and this
is the morphe M 505 this is my favorite
crease brush from morphe well aside from
one in the Ely collection but those are
more expensive this is definitely one of
their affordable brushes this brush is
so soft like incredibly soft and to me
it's the perfect size it's the perfect
shape for that perfect blown-out crease
shade you know your transition shade
that first little buddy you put down and
to me it compares to like a matte crease
brush a sigma one just as good for sure
okay I had one more okay so I have six
brushes to talk about see but these two
technically they come in a little set
and you guys need to get this low set
these are two little brushes from the
brand LA Colors my friend Melissa
actually bought these for me I think she
either bought them at the Family Dollar
or the Dollar Tree but they were two
bucks they came together in a little
pack and it was $2.00 I've tried brushes
like at the dollar store and they
haven't been my favorites this this is
great you get a really great pointed
crease brush so anybody can use this
brush and then of course a classic
shader brush and I love that it's big
check your local dollar store or
wherever they sell le colors near you
maybe you'll find them okay and then the
last I shadow brush I have no idea what
this is called this is the only thing I
don't love about the Wet n Wild brushes
they don't have the name on the actual
brush so I don't know what this is
called but from what I can tell this is
probably called like a shader brush this
isn't their small concealer brush it
looks similar but it's not that one they
came out with a ton of brushes and I've
been raving about them for a while
though I will say not all of them are
that great some of them I love others
are okay but just for the price you
really can't beat it
this brush I love with color pop
eyeshadows how they pop has a tricky
formula you really have to use them
either with your finger or with a
synthetic brush I love this one because
it's synthetic but it's very
like it packs on the product really
nicely and other eyeshadows as well
because it is like a nice stiff shader
brush awesome awesome awesome okay so
now let's move on to the face brushes I
have nine to share with you I have three
based products I really want I'm sorry
that these brushes have been dirty I
just realized that I've been showing you
some dirty arse brushes but when I do
the close-ups I will I will clean them
before you see some close-ups I'm sorry
the elf ultimate blending brush this is
the brush that fell into my coffee and I
couldn't clean I ruined it so now I have
a new one for some reason it doesn't say
the ultimate blending brush on the
barrel anymore
I don't know what's up with that it's
the elf ultimate blending brush it's six
bucks and it's amazing I especially love
this with BB Creams and like kind of
like a thicker mousse your consistency
because I feel like it buffs it in so
nicely like my egg cosmetics CC cream
the urban decay tinted moisturizer I
don't know I like it with those types of
products but it also works great for
full coverage foundation this is a
recent discovery that also blew me away
because it is dirt cheap this is the Wet
n Wild flat top kabuki brush I've washed
this brush so many times and I don't get
any shedding and I think it's dense but
not too dense I don't know I feel like
it's the perfect little flat top brush
perfect if you want the most coverage
out of your foundation this really gives
you like a nice full coverage this one I
had mentioned I use for concealer and
for some reason mine is falling apart
it kind of just shed all over my lap
right now I don't know what is just like
all the hairs are falling out I don't
know if I've washed this one too many
times but now I'm getting really sad
let's ignore that this is the selfie
ready foundation brush I don't know why
they called it that but I really really
love this brush to blend down my
under-eye concealer I feel like it does
it so fast because it is pretty big but
it's not too big at least not for me I
think it's the perfect size especially
when I'm in a hurry and I really want to
blend out that under-eye concealer like
this I always go for this brush really
soft love this although I might have to
replace it because mine seems to be
shedding this has quickly become one of
my favorite highlighting brushes of all
time this is the morphe M
u10 brush I never thought I would like a
fan brush to highlight my face they just
never wear my favorite I've tried so
many Sigma Mak I've tried so many fan
brushes I've never liked any of the ones
I've tried even other fan brushes from
morphe I don't like I don't know why but
to me this is the perfect fan brush
I know people use these kind of brushes
for many different things I personally
just use it to highlight these
cheekbones
Zeno's this is your face and I love it
it's not too dense not too like fat it's
not too flimsy either or too thin it's
just awesome another elf brush but the
elf blending brush is amazing if you
don't have this brush what have you been
doing with your life this takes
contouring to a whole another level this
is an amazing contour brush and the best
part is so affordable there are a ton of
brushes out there like highly raved
about that are so pricy like the NARS
either brush the Tarte one that has like
the wooden handle it's fat it's awesome
I own it but it isn't as affordable as
this and this is just as good it's not
too thin you're not going to have that
really thin harsh line and it's nice and
dense to where you can easily blend out
that contour if it is too harsh
my next favorite is another wedding wild
brush and again I don't know what the
name is I'm sorry I think it might be
labeled as their powder brush or blush
brush I don't know I use it for blush
it's such a simple brush there's not
much to it it looks like just a very
small powder brush but for me it just
applies my blush perfectly like it gets
right on the apples of my cheeks you can
also do like a soft contour with this
bronze the skin all around really good
brush to have these next two brushes I'm
pretty sure I bought in a set or maybe I
bought this powder brush separately and
then this was in a set regardless these
are both brushes from Target target has
its own brand called the up-and-up brand
I'm sure you guys know and these are the
up-and-up
brushes I first heard about these
brushes through Emily Noel they are
incredibly soft brushes very affordable
and just good good quality they don't
shed on me at all I've washed these they
don't shed this one I love for so many
things
I've set my under eye concealer with
this eye bronze with this I've applied
my contour my blush it's just one of
those kind of brushes that can do a lot
of things and then this one I love for
powder I also love the really big Real
Techniques powder brush that one is
amazing too
sometimes I can get a little bit too big
a little too too heavy this is perfect
to just dip it into my powder and just a
powder Zee face love it and then my last
brush is my favorite stippling brush
from the drugstore and it is my ELF
stipple brush and not just any elf
stipple brush the travel elf stipple
brush for some reason I don't know why
they're regular stippling brush like if
you go into the store and you buy their
sibling brush it's different from their
traveling one not just because it's
shorter but because it is thicker it's
fatter I feel like it is better I don't
know I love using this to kind of blend
everything out I love this brush just as
much as my morphe mb5 these are my two
favorite affordable stippling brushes I
thought I would just show you this
really quick I love them both but they
are a little bit different try out the
travel stippling brush it comes in a
little set with a couple of other
brushes I think that the set is worth
the money and the plus side is this is
great to travel with I don't know I
really love this brush ok guys so that
completes this video this was my updated
favorite affordable brushes video it's
