my updated skincare routine I didn't
think that I needed to do this video
because it's very similar to my last
skincare routine I think I posted it
about a year ago definitely certain
things have changed but for the most
part I kind of used the same things I
was using in that video but it's been so
requested to do an updated one so here
it is and like all my skincare videos I
am not wearing any face makeup because I
want you guys to see my skin for what it
is I do have my brows on I have mascara
and I have a lipstick on but that's it
there is absolutely nothing on my skin
except my moisturizer and we're just
going to chat about my favorite skincare
products what I use how I use them and
then at the end of this video there will
be a demo I'm not going to talk through
the demo I'm just gonna have you see
what I'm doing because all the talking
I'm gonna do right now I'll explain
everything and go into detail so I won't
have to during the demo before I get
started I want to give a disclaimer
really quick a lot of the products I
will be talking about today are very
pricy products you guys know I'm a huge
fan of drugstore makeup and drugstore
products in general but when it comes to
skincare I don't want to sit here and
lie to you guys like I love more
high-end skincare not because I think
that drugstore skincare sucks but
because these are the products that have
worked for me and I like investing in my
skin now I used to use drugstore
skincare all the time like all through
high school middle school like I used
drugstore skincare out to tan until I
had my own job and then I started to
invest a little bit more into skincare
if you are a beginner in skincare this
video is probably not for you like I'm
sure you can find products that work for
your skin at the drugstore you
definitely should start there I know all
of these products are pretty pricey my
skincare routine has been requested and
I'm gonna show you what I use okay so
I'm jumping into my nighttime skincare
routine first when I'm on the go my
favorite thing to use to remove makeup
is makeup remover wipes they're just so
easy I really love the simple micellar
cleansing towelettes but if I'm not on
the go like if I'm not traveling I
typically use these guys to remove my
makeup if I have like a full face of
makeup like I did the whole
bang liner if I packed it on I will
definitely use the Dermalogica pre
cleanse this is a deep cleansing oil it
removes everything it's definitely hands
down my favorite oily based makeup
removers that I've ever tried and I've
tried a ton of them I've tried the
Lancome Neutrogena
bozhe like I've tried a lot and this one
is definitely my favorite I apply just
one pump of this I rub it in between my
fingers and just start melting my makeup
off it removes waterproof makeup as well
it's phenomenal
I highly recommend this I bought this at
Ulta and if I just have like a more
natural makeup day like not that much
makeup on my face I will take off my
makeup with Bioderma I've gone through
so many bottles of this Bioderma is
hands-down my favorite my cellular water
these things are very popular now it's
like every brand is coming out with
their own my similar water but for some
reason this is the only one that does
not burn my eyes it's so gentle on my
eyes this is the sensibio h2o I know
there's like a blue one but I like this
one I like the original red one this is
a fabulous makeup remover like I have no
problem removing any type of makeup with
this it's amazing I have showed a demo
of me using this in previous skincare
routines so in the demo I'll be using
the Dermalogica one but I love both of
them so much my hair is a mess once I
make sure that I have all my makeup off
or like the majority of my makeup off I
go in with my cleanser and this is
something that definitely has changed
from my previous skincare routine I have
three cleansers that I've been using and
I love them and I'm going to talk about
all three of them right now even though
I use like one of the other in the
morning I'm just gonna get into the
cleansers so I still use my fresh soy
face cleanser this is one of my favorite
cleansers because it is so gentle on the
skin I didn't mention it earlier but I
have very dry very sensitive skin and I
don't mean sensitive in the way that I
break out I'm not really prone to
breakouts I don't get a lot of acne but
the texture of my skin is very very
sensitive if I use a product that
doesn't mesh with my skin I will get the
worst texture ever my face will feel
like sandpaper it's the weirdest thing
but that's typically how I hurry
to two products that don't work for me
this is great for my sensitive skin it
smells like cucumbers and it's just a
very mild cleanser really really good
stuff
my other two cleansers are definitely
new to me I completely stopped using
purity and honestly I don't know why but
I got really tired of just using purity
I'd been using purity for years and what
I liked most about purity is how well it
took off my makeup but now that I kind
of remove my makeup before are you go in
with a cleanser I just I don't know I
wanted to try different things and I
purchased this online based on so many
recommendations from you guys this is
the glossy a milky jelly cleanser this
is really great at first I hated it like
I cannot describe this cleanser it feels
unlike any other face wash I've used it
feels like I'm putting on gel like
actual gel onto my face it doesn't foam
up at all which is a good thing though
because I hate like super foamy
cleansers because those tend to dry out
my skin even more this one is like
ridiculously gentle like on another
level of gentleness I like that it
doesn't irritate my skin and it does
take off like everything if I still have
traces of makeup on my eyes this takes
it off my face doesn't feel stripped it
doesn't feel tight so that is why I use
it and really love it I also don't like
the scent I don't like how this smells
smells like weird I don't know and I was
not a friend of the texture when I first
started using it it was so odd to me but
now I've gotten used to it and I really
do love it
the other cleanser that I've been using
and totally freaking loving I love this
so much this is from the brand derma dr.
I love the packaging it's glass it has a
pump and it is their brightening daily
cleanser with vitamins C a and a chaise
it's their Kakadu C cleanser I love this
because this is a cleanser toner and
makeup remover all-in-one very similar
to purity purity kind of has all those
benefits but I like this one more than
purity I said it's the light fold gentle
hydrating soap free foaming gel helps
dissolve cosmetics remove impurities and
leave skin feeling fabulous and
refreshed and it helps your complexion
look healthy and radiant it does say
it's a foaming gel but it does not dry
out my skin
at all I just love how well this claims
my skin I love the soy face cleanser and
I love the one from glossier but this
one cleans my skin like it really gets
in there and I feel like my skin is
super super clean when I use this and
it's also great that it has eh-eh-eh-eh
stands for alpha hydroxy acid and it's
really really great for anti-aging and I
also feel like it really does brighten
my skin so I have been using this from
German doctor and I've been loving it
but it at Sephora really good stuff and
of course you guys know I use my foreo
luna 2 for sensitive skin to cleanse my
skin I have a whole video dedicated to
this bad boy right here and about the
solo meal which is a pretty good dupe
for this for like way less than half the
price they have a ton of affordable
options but this is the one I use and
love and I use it in conjunction with my
cleanser so once my skin is completely
cleansed I will go in with this guy
right here now I don't use this every
single day this is a serum that I use
every other day or every two days just
because for me simple is best I like a
very simple skincare routine I don't
like to pile products on but I love the
results this gives me this is the drunk
elephant TLC Framm boosts glycolic night
serum this is a gel that kind of works
as an exfoliator it has glycolic acid
and I apply this to my skin before my
moisturizer and it does tingle a little
bit like you get a little bit of a
tingling sensation not a burn but like a
tingly Ness and that's the glycolic acid
in here I believe I find that this
really really helps the texture of my
skin I've been using this for a while
now you guys know it's a very pricey
skincare product like when I first
purchased it it hurt hurt but it really
really works so I really think it's
worth it oh I also wanted to mention
that recently I have been using skin
care products to have a pump I think
that that's so important for skin care
companies to put their products in like
either a squeezy tube or a pump because
a lot of the ingredients in your
skincare products aren't supposed to be
exposed to light and air so if you have
a skincare product that comes in a jar
once you open it and it's exposed like
to air a lot of the
ingredients lose their power and become
less beneficial like no matter how great
the ingredients are no matter how
anti-aging the ingredients are if it's
in a jar and it's exposed to like the
environment it messes with like the
formula which I have a product that I
have in a jar and I'm so upset that it's
in a jar but I love it so much that I
still use it but besides that most of my
actually all of my skincare products
either come in a squeeze tube or a pump
because I want to get the most out of my
ingredients and the most out of my money
so anyway with that being said after I
put on my night serum I will go in with
either an oil or my moisturizer if my
skin is feeling like super dry I will go
in with an oil I don't have one to share
with you right now because I have like
87 I will go in with jojoba oil marula
oil
I love the drunk elephant one argan oil
like any kind of oil I slather that on
my face and go to sleep
but if I'm not using oil this is my
favorite moisturizer it's been my
favorite moisturizer for years now but I
hate that it's in a jar this is the
origins high potency night immense
mineral enriched renewal cream if
origins would do me a solid and put this
in a pump or a squeeze tube I feel like
that would make that would be beautiful
I have gone through so so many little
jars of this I don't know how to explain
it but I see an incredible difference
when I use this this helps my little
white bumps okay for example like if a
foundation breaks me out like if it
doesn't irritate my texture it breaks me
out I will get white bumps all over my
forehead like a sea of white bumps I
don't know what that is I don't know I
don't know why because it's not like
pimples it's just white bumps all over
my forehead this helps to take it away
like I have a feeling my Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation breaks me out
because I've been getting white bumps on
my forehead like whenever I take that
off I notice a few bumps and when I use
this like two nights in a row
they're completely gone helps with my
dry skin I love it
so hydrating so moisturizing and amazing
I did want to touch base on another
moisturizer that I've been using back
and forth this is the it cosmetics
confidence in a cream I told why is it
in the jar I feel like it cosmetics
would know better than to put it in the
jar right I don't know but I've been
using
on and off and I want to talk about it
because a couple people have asked me my
opinion I think this is really really
great I feel like my skin looks nice and
plump the next day and it is anti-aging
but I mean image on our song and also I
want to know your thoughts on this I
just recently purchased this because my
friend Jamie from Jamie page Beauty here
on YouTube she told me to buy this
because it has been working for this is
the Kiehl's hydro plumping retexturizing
serum concentrate just purchase this off
of the Nordstrom website and I kind of
want to use it like in conjunction with
this or like every other day that I'm
not using this one I want to start using
this one because it says it's for
texture and she says it's really really
been helping her texture so I'm so
excited for this have you guys tried
this out let me know your thoughts on
this product because I'm very excited to
use it after I put on my moisturizer I
go in with my eye cream and that is this
right here this is hands down hands down
forever and ever and ever the best
nighttime eye cream in the history of
the world this is the Kiehl's midnight
recovery eye comes in a little squeezy
to be like this and it is a miracle
worker
I notice immediate results like around
two weeks I noticed that my eyes seemed
less dark not as puffy just overall
brighter and no other under-eye cream
used to do that for me
a restorative concentrate of essential
oils and botanicals for fresher younger
looking eyes by morning and I agree with
you I have gotten everyone to use this
my sister my cousin Danny uses this like
I love this eye cream and then after I
do that I go to sleep that's pretty much
everything I do at nighttime that's my
nighttime skincare routine so when I
wake up in the morning I will wash my
face typically with the fresh soy face
cleanser I really like this one in the
morning and then after I do that I keep
it really simple in the daytime I put on
my eye serum and then I put on a
moisturizer the eye serum I use in the
morning is the drunk elephant shabak
complex eye serum this is probably one
of the most pens i serum I've ever used
but I was on the hunt for like a daytime
eye serum that wasn't a moisturizer like
I didn't want to put on a thick
moisturizer during the day because I
find that all the ones I've tried don't
really sit well under makeup and
I wanted something a little bit more
lightweight something like a serum and
that it had a pump it's an eye serum
that's supposed to tackle the major
signs of anti aging under and around the
eyes such as fine lines wrinkles dark
circles and puffiness to be honest I
haven't really noticed any like
anti-aging benefits with this I say that
this one gives me more dramatic results
like when I wake up in the morning like
wow this one just hydrates my under eyes
and helps with the puffiness it says it
has a rejuvenating blend of copper
peptides Co Q 10 and a dull Weiss stem
cells that support collagen while
reducing the depth of wrinkles and
fading age spots again really pricey I'm
sorry but I just I really love this
brand and then after I go in with my eye
serum I will go in with my daytime
moisturizer and the one I use is this
one right here this is from Paula's
Choice this is the skin recovery
replenishing moisturizer for normal dry
and very dry skin this is actually not a
very pricy product Paula's Choice is a
great skincare brand with really good
prices for what you're getting it's like
an amazing brand with really good
ingredients and it's not that pricey so
I really love Paula's choice if you have
super dry skin I would highly recommend
this it's not too thick so I totally can
use this underneath my makeup it's
supposed to reduce wrinkles at I don't
know but it's also supposed to soothe
sensitive skin and rosacea and I find
that to be true I don't have rosacea but
I do have sensitive skin I find that
this is a very gentle moisturizer that
just kind of soothes my skin it doesn't
leave my face greasy it's not too thick
it doesn't give me like the bumps
because it's so rich you know it's not
too much which is what I really love it
says clinically proven non-irritating
and it's a hundred percent fragrance
free that is a major thing I don't like
using skincare products that have
fragrance in it like my mom will use
like a Chanel cream or like a codel e
cream and there they smell so intense to
me that I don't like them I don't like
skincare products that have a strong
scent to them I hate it so I have been
using this for a few months now maybe
like eight months and I love it for my
dry skin I was using this
is the llama retro whipped-cream from
drunk elephant it has six rare African
oils and plantain extract it is really
great in hydrating but I don't like the
fact that it's in a jar which kind of
shocks me for drunk elephant I feel like
all their products come in a pump why
would this be in a jar like come on
drunk elephant you know better than to
pull this in a jar this definitely needs
to be repackaged okay repackage this so
for that reason I don't use that product
I don't I much prefer the Paula's Choice
moisturizer over that one so yeah that
completes this video those are skincare
products I'm using and other skin care
products I also like and all that good
stuff
yeah that completes this video I will
get into the demo now but before I do
please leave me a comment down below if
there is like a Holy Grail skincare
product that you have if you have like
very dry sensitive skin and kind of like
texture issues or any issues that I have

works for you and I'll look into it but
for now these products have been working
really really really well with my skin

definitely improved and I'm very happy
