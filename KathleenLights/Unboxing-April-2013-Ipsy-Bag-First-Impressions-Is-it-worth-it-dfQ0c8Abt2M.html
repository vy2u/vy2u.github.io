because I just posted a video on YouTube
like three hours ago or something like
that but I got my Ipsy bag in the mail
today and this is I signed up for a PC
for the first time last month I wanted
to try it out and I wanted to do like a
first impressions like is it worth it
video and yeah that's what I'm going to
do now and I haven't opened it I kind of
cheated cuz I know what's in the bag
like a couple of girls posted their bags
on Instagram and I saw them and but I
don't know what I got because you can
get like different things so this what
the bag looks like this isn't my
favorite out of the bags um I've seen
I've seen really really cute ones that
some girls have got in like a couple
months ago and a few months ago this is
my favorite but I mean it's cute
the theme is pretty in pink like that's
the little theme of the month so yeah my
momma is calling me but I can't talk to
you right now girl anyway
so this was the bag looks like and yeah
this is what it looks like inside I'm
just going to go ahead and show you the
first thing is this sation sation
session I don't know
it's a box like this it's a nail polish
I've never heard of this brand but I
really like it's really pretty this is
like a peachy color
there you can get to you can get the
peach one or you can get a pink one so
yeah this is the color it's really nice
it looks like it would be a little bit
sheer but you could probably build it up
I really like it I don't know the
staying power I don't know how long it
lasts if it chips or anything like that
because I've never heard of this brand
but I'll try it out and I haven't pulled
up on my phone here what the prices are
so this nail polish is is five bucks
so I'm here to buy this if you were to
buy this on its own it will be five
dollars and the Ipsy bag every month
which I'm sure you know is $10 as a $10
subscription and you get like stuff in
it so that's five bucks the next thing
that's in here is this mica mica I don't
know how you pronounce this it's the
beauty cosmetics and it's a like
shimmery powder it's like an eye shadow
but I should run one I'm just gonna open
this and kind of show you what it looks
like swatched on my hand
oh my excuse my 80s style hair today I
wasn't gonna film I really didn't feel
like doing much to my hair so I just
kind of did it that half-up half-down
thing it's my hair all natural I did not
iron it or anything
um I don't know if you can tell let me
zoom in so it's like a shimmery
eyeshadow this is really pretty I'm kind
of glad I got this over the other thing
that's in the FC bag this month it's a
duo eyeshadow and it's like a light pink
and like a little bit darker pink I'm
not super big on like pink on my eyelids
but I'm going to try this out I actually
really like this does anybody else feel
like really naked when their nails
aren't painted because my nails are not
painted I just feel so off this is I'm
pretty sure this is a full size like
when you go by the shimmer powders on
the mica website mica website I don't
know I'm pretty sure this is full-size
and this by itself is 14.95 the next
thing in the bag is this healthy sexy
hair soy renewal nourishing styling
treatment you know some people got the
red one that a red healthy sexy hair
bottle and I think it's a volumizing
powder I think but I actually wanted
this instead of that so I'm kind of glad
that I got that I got this instead mom
the event maybe though okay sorry about
that
anyway I'm kinda bad I got this over the
volumizing powder because it says it
reduces frizz which is what I'm all
about obvious
they tell by a chia pet if I don't try
to control this for is somehow anyway so
yeah this this is um this is interesting
I like this Oh
to tell you the full price or like the
full size the price is 2195 so it's
pretty expensive so I know that the sex
the healthy sexy hair line is really
good I've never tried anything but I
know that a lot of people say it's good
I just never tried it because it is kind
of pricey and every time I see it I'm
like I just kind of walked past it I
don't even bother but I'm excited to try
this because if it's good you know I
might just find and the last thing in
the bag is a full-size product and it is
a be a bombshell blush I know that some
people were complaining that usually
they get like five things and their FC
bags but considering that I mean it's a
full-size blush that's pretty exciting
so I'm okay with just getting forth and
I got the color sweet cheeks which is
just like the lighter pink I know some
people call like a super hot pink um so
yeah I heard really good things up these
blush let's try this on just to show you
guys what it looks like but I was so
excited for this cuz I've been wanting a
pink blush let's see what this looks
like my mom here
I was cute
it's nice I like this it's really
pigmented I'm not like a blush girl I'm
super afraid of bullish because I feel
like I could look like a clown really
fast it's really pigmented but it's
really nice I like it so this blush is
full-size and it is $16 if you were to
buy this by itself so this bag is
definitely worth it for me this month
considering that you get a full-size
blush that's originally $16 and in
full-size nail polish at 6 bucks and
these and this thing which has a lot of
product in it that's originally $15 I
mean it is worth it I loved everything I
got and I'm going to continue to
subscribe to FC I love it and I really
think that if you haven't given it a try
just going to try it's $10 a month and
if you don't like it you can just cancel
anytime but I'm really excited with the
stuff I got and I'm going to be
uploading these videos every month if I
can to kind of show you if that month
was worth it or not to tell you the
prices that they are on their website
and show you what I got and if it's
worth the money yet a little blah and
stuff like that so stay tuned for those
videos thanks for watching guys and
don't forget to subscribe for more
videos I'll see you in my next video bye
let's see if this reduces frizz or if
it's all a lie
smells like I don't know okay
it's most like a salon like that
professional salon like what stuff's
there in there it smells like
Oh
sure sure not bad not bad I mean I got a
lot of frizz too
um you know so it smells really good
actually like really really good I like
this a light does a lot so I was taking
off my makeup and I decided to try the
Micah because thing on my eyes and here
I have it by itself like just all over
my lid and here I have it with six plus
like I added I sprayed fix+
to my brush and then put it on my lid
and I think it's so pretty like if you
guys got it in your subscription box
sorry I'm like taking my makeup off I am
so rude sorry I'm a little bit too close
for comfort but I wanted to show you
really fast and if you got it in your
subscription box this month and you're
like I can't even say this I'm at it try
using fix+ because i think it's
beautiful
if you have X plus to it because you can
try mean it's nice if you don't add fix
plus but it's just look how nice and
just glimmers I like so try using fix
plus okay I'm done now
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
