every video but it is raining so much
right now and I wasn't going to film at
all today but I got my up sivak and of
course I have to do my monthly unboxing
video like I always do it has been
raining so bad here has it been like
that wherever you guys are let me know
because I cannot stand the weather
recently anyway let's get on with it
okay so this month this is what the bag
looks like it's purple with some gold
stuff on it and it says if see glamour
Academy gotta say not my favorite bag
it's so cute I'm sure a lot of people
would love this bag it's just not my
style but anyway it comes with these two
cards the glamour Academy car and then
this this benefit card which is actually
pretty cool you should read it if you
got your tipsy bag anyway let's get on
to what's inside the bag okay so the
first thing you see in this bag is the
Pixy lash booster mascara this is this
is a very small little sample of a
mascara I'm sure you would go through
this pretty quickly and the wand seems
nice I like a like fiber bristle type
wands
I don't like rubber ones so hopefully I
will like this and if you shop at Target
you know that pixie is a really
expensive brand and when I went on the
website it was $22 for the full size of
this which is a lot of money for a
mascara so maybe it's good I don't know
but that was cool the next thing in here
is a nail polish they send out the nail
tini type of nail polishes all the time
and I've never actually tried a nail
tini nail polish but this is the color
guy it's really pretty it's like an
orange you read which is some one of my
favorite
others Scarlett I think the crayon is
called is it anyway
this is in the color my tie and this is
obviously a full-size nail polish and
this costs thirteen dollars which is
pretty expensive for a nail polish if
you ask me so that's cool that we got
this okay so the third thing in the bag
is this mica mica I don't know Beauty
cosmetics shimmer powder and I've gotten
this before in my Ipsy bag right here
and actually really like these pigments
they're really good um the one I got
today is a different color thank God and
it is in the color bronze so let's see
how it looks
these are actually really good pigments
it's actually a really really beautiful
color and it's up my alley with the type
of shades I like to wear on my eyelids I
love all those bronze and gold and all
those peachy kind of colors so I
actually think I would really enjoy this
this is obviously full size and it costs
14.95 so just this alone is more than
the Ipsy bag and I really like these
pigments okay next thing in the bag is
this thing right here and it's an Urban
Decay revolution lipstick and it's a
little stamp and it's a little sample of
the lipstick again now
there's a tiny tiny little sample of it
but it is so my finger stuck it is so
cute though that's what colors is I got
mine in 69 I was really hoping that I
would get it in Anarchy but I got it in
69 it's it's a lot smaller than I
thought it was it's so cute though it
actually goes on my hand very very
smooth and you can tell right away that
this is extremely creamy and pigmented
I'm sure these lipsticks are amazing
Urban Decay rarely disappoints for me
so I might pick up one of these
full-size of these things because it
looks absolutely beautiful it's like a
red but you can tell there's like a hint
of pink in there somewhere it's a very
pinky red which I really really like
wearing these shades and it's a cute
little sample I really love it
the full-size version of these lipsticks
are $22 the suspensive and the last
thing in the bag is what I was most
excited for and it is the Michael Todd
true organics pumpkin nutrient rich
facial mask and I was most excited that
they were putting this in the bag this
month because everybody talks up a storm
about the Michael Todd skincare line
like everyone is obsessed with it on
YouTube so I was really excited that
they were putting this in the bag and it
says moisturizes and nourishes all skin
types
except sensitive oh I don't care I'm
going to try it anyway I love masks that
are really moisturizing and nourishing
because I have dry skin
so hopefully this I don't have any like
reaction to this so I'm going to try
this out and I will let you know how
good it is oh and the full-size version
of this red guy is 34 bucks so that's
cool okay so that's it that is
everything I got in my Ipsy bag this
month I do think it's worth it this
month they give you two full-sized
products and the rest are samples but
there are samples of pretty expensive
so that's amazing the bag overall was
well over $50 so it's definitely worth
it it's just $10 a month and you get to
try out a bunch of new products I think
it's worth it like I've said 16 times
already
thank you so much for watching guys
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
I'm gonna take off my lipstick and try
it on by the way if you're wondering
what lipstick I'm wearing I am wearing
my favorite lipstick at the moment me
Milani rosehip if you were wondering I
like that they don't have a scent
well at least this doesn't this color is
so pretty let's see how well this
mascara really works I'm gonna take off
my mascara you know let's just take up
all the eye makeup
might as well I'm gonna try out this
mascara
so this is what the mascara looks like I
did two coats and it gives a lot of
length I love that it didn't really
clump and my bottom lashes just look
good - I really love this mascara it's
like good one now that I already look
crazy I'm going to try out the medica
Beauty cosmetics shimmer powder let's
see how that looks okay so I added some
of the bronze mica shimmer powder on my
eyelids and then I just added some fix+
to my brush and added the product with
fix+ right in the center so it's a
little bit more like BAM in your face
gold but this is a beautiful beautiful
pigment i am so obsessed with this you
have no idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
