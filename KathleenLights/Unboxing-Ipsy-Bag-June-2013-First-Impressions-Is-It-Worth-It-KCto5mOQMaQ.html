hypsi bag unboxing video and I got my
bag pretty late this month I usually get
it like on these 13th but well the 13th
around there umm this month it was a
little late so yeah I obviously this is
the first time I'm opening this and this
theme the theme for this month is the on
the wild side there's some birds and
yeah the bag this month is amazing
though like look at how cute this bag is
I haven't been blown away by the bags
each month I just think that honestly
they're just regular little bags they're
cute but they're not anything special to
me but I'm obsessed with this month's
bag like I'm definitely am putting this
in my purse putting some makeup products
in it because I love it just the fact
that it has like a neon bright green
zipper is just so cute and it's actually
pretty good material I really like it
anyway to the important stuff which is
what's on the inside I have the prices
pulled up here on my phone like I do
every month just to tell you the value
of the bag and of course if it's worth
it or not so the first thing I see in
the bag is this NYX blush this is a
full-sized NYX blush I love how if she
really does a good job at sending
full-size products instead of just like
little samples it is in the shade mauve
and I could open this okay so it looks
like this it is just like a very light
peachy pink color and I actually really
really love it I've always been somebody
who just didn't really buy a lot of
blushes just because I felt like
sometimes when I would put
Shawn and it would be too much I look
like a clown so that's why I'm on my
videos when I do put on blush it's just
like a very light wash of blush I've
been trying to step out of my comfort
zone a little bit and trying to use
blush more so I'm really happy that I
got this and I love the color let me
swatch it last month it was the last
month no like two months ago when they
sent the be a bombshell blushes the one
I got was really pretty but the other
one was a hot pink and I love that this
is like a very light pink and I think
that it would suit my skin tone pretty
well let me zoom so this is the swatch
of the blush I love it it's like a very
light peachy pink and I like that it's
not shimmery
it's like matte but with a little bit of
a glow I don't know if you can tell
which I love though because I do love my
matte blushes but I love that this is
not like a flat out mat there's like
some glow to it which i think is
beautiful like I said this is the color
mauve and I love it this comes out to $5
people got different blushes like the
cream blushes $6 and like the mosaic one
is $7 but this one is $5 which is half
the price of the bag already and I love
it like I would definitely buy this on
my own so I love that so the next thing
in the bag is this day Kat sparkling
cream palette everybody got one of these
you either got like these silver ones
like the ones with the grays and the
silvers or this one has like a gold like
a reddish color
um there's like a champagne color a very
very gold and kind of like a rose gold I
was actually hoping that I got this one
instead of the other one cuz I'm more of
a warmer you know I like warm
colors and to be honest in the beginning
when I first saw that this was in our
bag like in the little sneak peeks I
wasn't too crazy about it I was like oh
I would never use that but I've seen
that a lot of people have been using it
on their eyes in their hair and on their
body so it is multi-purpose I thought it
was literally just like glitter
eyeshadows because that's
I saw people were saying but a lot of
people have been using it like
everywhere so wow it's really pretty
okay so when I put my finger in the
first one it's like very glittery let me
zoom okay so this is what it looks like
up close and it is really pretty but
when I put my finger in it comes off
really glittery but I mean really it's
just a bunch of sparkly glitter you know
it comes like right off I'm sure this
would be nice like in your hair or
something maybe like some body glitter
this one's actually really nice the
second one is like very fine glitter
like a really really fine glitter yeah
so it's just really fun crazy glitter
all I really think about when I see this
and as I'm playing with it is Halloween
like this would be fun for Halloween
it's it's a really fun product obviously
it's not really practical for everyday
or for you know something natural or you
know things like that but I'm sure that
you can have a lot of fun with this I
have glitter all over my pants so yeah I
mean it's a really fun just like glitter
palette to throw in your body in your
hair you know like all over your face if
you want that's that's what you're into
you know I see myself using this in the
future someday on you know Halloween or
something so price-wise these little
pallets are for 49 okay so next thing in
the bag is this starlooks
lip liner let me try to open this okay
so yeah this is obviously a full-size
lip liner and this is obviously a
full-size palette so so far everything
in this bag has been full-size which is
awesome and this is just a oh it's
really pretty actually
it's like a very berry pink lipliner you
know what I'm gonna put it on for you
guys take it off my lip gloss ething
I've got
it goes on really really smooth like
it's not harsh at all like it doesn't
tug at my lips oh wow
I actually really really like it it's a
lip liner but it doesn't feel dry on my
lips it feels like a little salt like
matte lipstick most lip liners that I
use it like really really dry but it's
actually a really pretty color I just
colored in my entire lips I love it
I really really love this it's really
good quality very soft very smooth I
love it let me see how much this is okay
so this lip pencil is $12 which is more
than what you paid for your epsy bag I
would definitely pay $12 for this on its
own cuz it's an amazing lip pencil it
just filled my whole lips very smoothly
and nicely and my lips don't feel dry
whatsoever okay so there are two more
things in the bag and this thing I see
is a chela ivory lace highlighter that's
on there good and basically it's like a
highlighter pen really really similar to
the Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighter
pen that comes with the brow is um I
love this thing so I'm really happy that
this came in the bag hopefully it's just
as good as I'm seeing it's like a peachy
shade and the Anastasia one is more pink
but this is a really nice um highlight
for underneath your brows if you don't
want to use eyeshadow or anything like
that this really just lifts your
eyebrows it's really pretty I like it
let me see how this looks underneath
raw bone actually didn't put on a
highlight under my brow bone today it's
kind of in a hurry so I really like it
it works just as well as my Anastasia
one I don't know if you can see that you
probably can't but kind of just lift
your eyebrows and gives it like a nice
highlight I think this is really nice I
really can't see the difference in like
formula or texture with my Anastasia one
and Anastasia ones are pretty expensive
this is $18 so yeah this is pretty
expensive on its own so the fact that
you paid $10 for an Ipsy bag and got an
$18 highlighter pencil thing that's
pretty good so the last thing is this
kaylynn line fix gel eyeliner this is
cool packaging okay so it looks like
this and it's kind of cool this unscrews
and then you get the product right here
this one's called iron it's like a gray
color I really really wanted the purple
one so I'm gonna have to switch with my
friend America cuz she got the purple
one and she was like why did you get
another color I'll switch with you but
it's really cool um the texture is
really sorry I keep opening and closing
it the texture is really really creamy
and it has pretty good pigmentation and
it's cool because it has like the brush
comes right off the top so this brush is
actually really good um I bought the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and it
comes with a brush just like this and I
use it all the time I think that these
brushes are pretty good so I think this
is definitely a cool little thing and
who doesn't love gel eyeliner okay so
the price of this is this is $21 this by
itself is $21 that's crazy
that's amazing okay so I added
everything up and the price of this
month's FC bag is over $60 and that is
crazy considering you paying $10 I think
that all the stuff I got this month is
really really good the only thing that
I'm like and about is the jcat sparkling
cream palette because it's not really
practical that's something I would
really use unless it was like a pool
party or something like that but I would
definitely use this blush this is
definitely an everyday blush I'm
obsessed with the lip liner it's
probably my favorite thing that came in
the bag the highlighter pen I love I
love my Anastasia one I love this one
seems very similar and this amazingly
cool gel liner um I love everything I
got definitely I think definitely worth
it this month I mean you're paying $10
for something and you get a $60 value
you can't beat that okay so yeah that is
everything I got in my Ipsy bag this
month I loved the bag this month I hope
