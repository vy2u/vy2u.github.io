mail today which of course means I'm
going to be doing my monthly unboxing
video I do these every month I haven't
opened it yet and so I'm opening it for
the first time on camera as always and
really quickly short story I busted the
crap out of my lip the other day right
here in the middle I just had like a
huge gash I cut myself
and I haven't been able to put on
lipstick or anything on my lips besides
like you know like some sort of lip
medication on my lips in like three days
so if it looks like I'm talking weird
because I even feel like I'm talking a
little bit weird because my lip is
kidding me it hurts it's like I don't
know if you can see it probably can't
but I heard I have no lipstick on or any
lip product on for this particular
reason I can't even smile like this is
as far as I can go anyway with that
being said I just really wasn't in the
mood to film today I've kind of been
like down in the dumps these past couple
days I don't know why I just haven't
been feeling like myself lately but when
I saw that I got this in the mail I was
like no the show must go on Kathleen you
have to suck it up and sit down and film
which is why I'm looking like Scary
Spice with my hair like this
apologies let's just get started
god I can see how puffy my hair is and
the viewfinder is not interactive okay
so right away I see the cutest bag in
the history of the world like I love the
bags they've been sending us recently
like last month's bag was really cute
too
this is like perfect for like your
sunglasses you're going to the beach
you're like your pencils for school if
you guys are interested in seeing like
what to do with your hip see bags that
are just like laying around your house
let me know down below because I will
definitely make a video on like what to
do with your like lips if see bags are
just like lying around oh and by the way
the theme this month is beach beauty
okay so the first thing I see here is
this little California collection BH
Cosmetics little sample um palette thing
oh god this is hard to open
okay so basically it just looks like
this and it has three little eyeshadows
than me so watch them they're basically
just like one shadow of each of the the
BH Hollywood and the BH San Francisco
and the BH Malibu palettes that came out
recently from BH Cosmetics obviously
these are the swatches it's just like a
purple a gold Andy Brown pretty good
pigmentation not like amazing but
they're pretty good pigmentation so yeah
basically you just get this cute little
trio as a little like sample of each of
the palettes and when I went to go check
how much this was on the website they
obviously don't sell this at least when
I checked I didn't see that like a
little trio of this so I didn't know how
much it was the original palettes are
like 10 bucks BH Cosmetics is like a
really good cheap brand so I couldn't
see how much this would particularly
cost because they didn't have that so oh
my god I feel like I'm all over the
place I'm really really sorry if I seem
like I can't even talk correctly or if
I'm like jittery it's just I feel
strange today the next thing in this bag
um in my bag is this derma e
microdermabrasion scrub and this is
interesting I didn't I don't know what
to think of this
it says here apply on wet or dry skin
gently scrub desired areas in the upward
circular motion for approximately three
minutes rinse with warm water use twice
a week
it smells like something like it
definitely obviously it smells like
something but I can't I don't remember
what this reminds me of I want to say
like very clean leaves I don't know let
me feel this oh it's so soft this
award-winning exfoliator helps diminish
the appearance of fine lines wrinkles
and acne scars leave skin youthful
radiant this scrub is $32 that's that's
a lot of money and it looks like you're
going to get a bunch of uses out of this
so that's really interesting I'm really
excited to try this looks looks like I
like it so that's the microdermabrasion
scrub next thing in the bag is this SPF
20 Kula mineral sunscreen unscented
moisturizer organic sunscreen oh that's
why boys wanted to try an organic
sunscreen I've got a guys when I saw
that this was in the ape sea bag I
wasn't too crazy about it about
receiving sunscreen I don't know let's
see if it isn't sent it Oh
it is it is very much incentive it
smells like absolutely nothing actually
it's pretty nice it doesn't feel greasy
at all this is the first sunscreen for
your face that I'm feeling that doesn't
feel greasy it feels like I have nothing
on my hand Wow seems like I might enjoy
this oh and by the way when I checked
the website it was $36 for this but I'm
sure it was $36 for like the full size
of bottle so the next thing I see is
this big sexy hair weatherproof humidity
resistant spray and I really love the
sexy hair stuff like the healthy sexy
hair and the big sexy hair line I think
that their amazing hair products it
smells good smells good
smells good please my hair nice and soft
I like you I'm kind of getting a lot of
uses out of this this is 1895 by the way
any last thing in the Ipsy bag is this
pop beauty crayon which is like a jumbo
lip crayon which if you watch my videos
or if you've been watching my videos you
know I'm obsessed with jumbo lip crayon
the Revlon jumbo sings jumbo yeah the
lip stain they're my favorite
I love the covergirl jumbo lip crayons I
love them all so this color is called
coral crush it's just like your really
pretty color I would swatch it on my
lips but Big Bertha is there and can't
be putting things on it right now and
wow it's really smooth like it just
glides on your hand doesn't feel sticky
at all well I think I'm gonna love this
so it is a really pretty color more pink
than coal roll I would say but it is
really pretty it's a nice summer color
and think I'm going to be getting a lot
of use out of this as well and when I
went to go check how much this was on
the website for some reason it didn't
show up like individually like you could
buy it individually it had a set of six
for twenty-five dollars but I couldn't
find them like individually really
strange so I mean it's six for $25 I
don't know like I said couldn't find
them individually by the way I forgot to
say that this winds up like this
so this is how much product you get
which isn't bad which is typical for the
Jumbo crayons that's usually how much
product you get anyway so yeah that's
everything I got in my Ipsy bag this
month everything in here was well over
$10 which is what you pay for it every
month I definitely suggest you check out
MC if you haven't already I think it's a
great beauty subscription and you get
cute little bags this bag is adorable
top pink and it's see-through and it's
so cute by the way I just got a Twitter
