on a few underrated makeup products that
I think more people should be talking
about just as we make of items that I
feel don't get enough love and attention
obviously I don't watch every single
beauty youtuber in the entire world so I
don't know if some of these products are
one you hear about all the time but for
me personally I feel like people talk
about these in mouth none of these items
are going to be like anything new except
maybe like one or two and let me know if
this is the kind of video you want to
see often on my channel maybe I could do
a part two I feel like there's a ton of
makeup that get so much hype here on
YouTube but then there's a ton of makeup
that don't really get that much hype
that are still really good and I want to
talk about them today the amani perfect
10 primer serum is such an underrated
primer it is so good I know they sell
this brand at Target that's worried
about this I want are looking into other
products from this brand they have a
foundation that I really want to try out
it's like a 12-hour foundation and I
don't know I don't hear anybody talking
about
Amani so I really want to look into the
breath anyway I discovered this primer
because I was watching a video by JC I
believe that's how you say her name and
she mentioned this in a favorites video
I think and I purchased it and I fell in
love with it if you have oily skin you
will probably hate this like hate this
but if you have very dry skin I think
you will really like this it's not a
moisturizing kind of primer it's
actually very sticky and as you're
blending it into your face it like it
gets really tacky but I find that my
foundation just sticks to it and it
lasts all day I feel like some people
with dry skin it's really hard to find a
primer that's going to make your makeup
last all day because usually we're just
looking for something really hydrating
and that's typically not very long
wearing but this this is long wearing I
don't know I love this so much perfect
for dry skin if you want to make your
makeup last and you want to look dewy
okay so my next product is actually
really new to me I haven't had it for
that long but I think it is so
underrated and I just talked about this
in my favorites video but this is the
number seven lift and luminate
foundation I want everyone to try this
on nation if you have dry skin I feel
like this is so beautiful I'm wearing it
on my skin today it makes you look so
healthy your skin looks radiant and dewy
and beautiful and it has pretty good
coverage I only do one layer of this and
I feel like it's enough but you can
build it up if you have oily skin I
think this might be too dewy for you but
it is beautiful you do have to set it
down with a powder because it does stay
a little bit of tacky when you touch it
and I find that even when you do set it
your skin still looks healthy it looks
beautiful I love this foundation so much
it's hypoallergenic I bought this at
Walgreens if you're in the market for a
foundation it has a pump that looks very
luminous and beautiful you need this in
your life I don't hear anyone talk about
the NYC smooth skin loose face powder I
might have seen like two people maybe
use it on YouTube but I don't no one
talks about it and I think it's so good
it's so incredibly affordable this is
like the cheapest powder ever I use this
today to set my entire face and I really
like it because I don't think it makes
my skin look too powdery do I have
powders in my collection that I prefer
over this yes but I still think this one
is way underrated because it's very
similar to the Laura Mercier one and
it's way more affordable I baked with
this before and it doesn't look cakey
when I sent my under-eye concealer and
never looks cakey I just love how it
makes my skin look and more people need
to get on this because it's so great
from the drugstore okay so this next
product is also pretty new to me I've
had it for a couple of months honestly I
don't know why I haven't talked about it
I guess because I just have it sitting
here on my vanity I keep grabbing for it
and putting it back and I never really
think to use it in a video because I
just use it kind of like on a daily
basis but anyway this is the Fiona
Styles multi-dimensional color palette
Fiona Styles is a brand that's
relatively new to Ulta and I tried a few
of her products I try and her foundation
wasn't a huge fan of it it was okay but
I gave it away I wasn't my favorite but
this I love so much it's just the
palette that has first of all has a
great mirror and then you get three
blushes to highlight and then a bronzer
right here I use this headlight as a
blush more than anything I never ever
use this color right here that's why it
doesn't look like it's ever been touched
because it hasn't but I love this who do
they literally use every other color a
lot of the times the products like this
only like two or three shades but this
one I love I wouldn't necessarily call
it underrated because I think it's
pretty new so I don't think it's
underrated I just don't think many
people have discovered it yet but I'm
here to tell you that it's really really
great I have these two colors on my
cheeks today as blushes that kind of
just mix them both and then I use this
color to bronze up my skin I always use
this color as a highlight too I just
didn't use it today
I'm going to show you another highlight
that I think is underrated but this is a
really nice natural yet luminous kind of
highlight I love it
I think the powders are really good
quality they're very soft and almost
creamy they don't have a sign of kick up
they're not hard to blend they're so
easy to work with I love this palette
let's talk about the highlight I am
wearing that I think is so underrated
this is the Laura Geller fake
highlighter duo in French vanilla in
Portofino
I feel like Laura Geller in general is
one of those brands with a lot of people
kind of like Rosa and I got to be honest
I'm not like incredibly impressed by the
brand overall there are some standout
products to me that I really love but as
a whole it's not my absolute favorite
but they have amazing baked products
their basic blushes are great I have one
in pink grapefruit that's amazing I
think their baked products are really
well made and french vanilla is the most
stunning natural almost matte kind of
highlight but it's not mad at all it has
a very soft Sheen to it it's behind like
I'm wearing on my face today I use this
one first and it gave me a really really
natural glow and then I said a little
bit of Portofino and I just hit the very
tops of my cheekbones with that one and
then that makes it like really really
intense I just love this I don't know if
you can still get it in this duo you
might have to get them separately but
they're both beautiful either way you go
is amazing if you're in so very natural
highlight that does not emphasize
texture at all then you need crunch for
the last coat yes I love this tooth
underrated if you're fair you need this
okay let's talk about some eyeshadow
palettes that I think are totally
underrated the first ones being all of
these the wave of palette the waiver has
some incredible eye shadows now these
aren't extremely underrated I do hear
people talking about them their brushes
are so good I think their brushes are
way better than Sigma zueva has some of
the best but I mean I guess I should
talk about their brushes too like
they're 1:34 highlighting brush is my
favorite brush to highlight ever so eva
has some incredible brushes that are
totally underrated and the same with
their palette this one definitely is my
all-time favorite zoeva paulo it's their
cocoa blend if you get one I highly
recommend this one it's beautiful it's
full of delicious chocolaty cocoa shades
I love this I have been trying to get my
hands on the
new one it has like orange shades I've
been trying to buy that but every time I
try to buy it it still about and I want
it so bad but yes definitely look into
the way of a palettes are amazing look
into the label as a whole there's such a
good brand the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette is probably the most
underrated palette in my opinion when it
comes to a full matte palette
you always hear people talk about the
Kat Von D shade + light eye palette the
Weiser palettes they're amazing but you
know you always hear people talk about
those and remembering that I can't think
of any more right now but you know it's
kind of other palettes full of matte
shadows to get way more attention than
this out of all my palettes that have
only matte shades this one is the best I
mean granted there is one shade in here
that's not mad it's like this pearly
Sheen you know what I think is amazing
about this palette is they're not a
hundred percent map they're more of a
satin finish that's a perfect way to
describe them because they have no Sheen
no shimmer none of that they look matte
but their texture is not as dry as a
matte shadow like when you put your
finger in they almost feel like a cream
they're like very very creamy beautiful
satin finish and they blend so well I'm
actually wearing this talent on my eyes
today I only have like three shadows I
have sunrise in my crease sunset on the
outer corner and then I have the pro
shade on my lid every time I grabbed it
I loved the look I do every single time
and never Sears me in the wrong
direction if you are looking for a matte
palette that's just going to be
incredibly easy to work with then you
need this one no one talks about it and
it's so good I don't like the other ones
as much as I like the original this one
is where it's it alone okay so sugar
pill in general I feel like is a brand
that is way underrated they make
incredible eyeshadows incredible
pigments I also really love their liquid
lipsticks I bought this palette on their
website it comes empty it's their 12 pan
magnetic Pro palette and then they have
a ton of single shadows on the website
and I bought a bunch of them and then
filled up this palette they're beautiful
highly highly pigmented colourful shades
they're neutral shades are really good
too but they're colorful shadows are
where it's at I even have a few single
shadows from them
I love sugarpill as a
and I think they're highly highly
underrated along with coloured raine
coloured raine is another brand I think
is definitely underrated they're liquid
lipsticks are amazing there are shadows
are amazing - I should have totally
included them in today's video but I am
right now coloured raine underrated that
is another brand that needs more height
I feel like when the pure eye polishes
first released they got a ton of hype
but then it kind of died down and not a
lot of people were talking about them
and these are products that I still use
till this day I spoke about them when
they first released and I love them
they're amazing because they're a liquid
eyeshadow that's really creamy really
easy to blend and really easy to apply
so when you put them on you you have
time to move around and put it into
places you want but then when it dries
in assets they do not budge and they
last the entire day I think this is one
of the best products pure has like on
their website besides their sponge and
look I was looking for this ones I don't
notice I love their sponge it's awesome
but their I polish Azhar so underrated
and they are so good this one in satin
is amazing and this one in silk is
stunning too they have a bunch of shades
but these two are my favorites I know I
talked about the color pop eyeliners all
the time on my channel and recently I
have been using the Marc Jacob ones like
crazy they're matte ones they're so good
I also really love the NYX pleasure
elite eyeliners but the LA girl glide
gel liners are awesome and they're
incredibly underrated I don't hear
anyone talking about these I usually use
them all the time on my channel and then
I kind of started using other things and
forgot about them then I started using
them again and they are so good they
glide on I mean they're called the glide
gel liners for a reason and they glide
on so smooth yet they are packed with
pigment and these are the kind of
eyeliners that are really slipping so
it's really easy to smudge and smoke out
but then when it sets it stays in place
all day I really really love being the
definitely thing you should check these
out I feel like la girl and the brand is
not underrated I hear a lot of people
talk about it on YouTube but I never
hear anybody talking about their
eyeliners and they are exceptional okay
and then the rest of these products are
lip products I think need more hype the
first one being the bike Beauty high
pigment pencil I recently spoke about
the shade Madeira in my favorites video
and this is actually what inspired me to
make this video
no one talks about these you hear a lot
of people talk about the bite
amuse-bouche lipstick I probably said
that wrong or the agave lip mask but I
feel like some of their other lip
products gets thrown away and this is
one of them these are so creamy they
kind of feel like the creme lipsticks
from Mac but even creamier and way
better and sometimes I don't want to
liquid lipstick but I don't want to let
go up either so I feel like this is a
perfect in-between it's a nice creamy
lipstick that gives me a little bit of a
shine and they're just very very
hydrating now I also think that these
are incredibly underrated these are the
bite Beauty Mac creme lip crayons these
are amazing I even like these more than
these these are matte and these are
creamy and I'm more of a matte lip kind
of gal these are awesome because they're
matte lipsticks but they're not drying
they're actually very smooth and very
creamy and they just glide on the lips
but then they sat down and they get a
little bit more matte and they have this
shape so it's really easy to apply with
this you can get really precise around
the lip line speed lasts forever on my
lips like you would think they're liquid
lipsticks my two favorite chains are
amaretto and cognac this is my favorite
Brown lipstick in my entire collection
and I have a lot of red lipsticks but
cognacs is my favorite when I want the
super dark of vampy Brown lips it's
going to stay in place like I just love
it I love these I know their lipsticks
are awesome like they're regular istic
but these are awesome too
the LA girl flat finish pigment glosses
are so awesome if you're looking for a
really really long lasting liquid
lipstick that's not going to transfer
and that it's going to get completely
matched this is the color I'm wearing on
my lips right now this in the shade
instinct and it's probably my favorite
red orange liquid lipstick I own if so
neon especially out in the Sun very bold
but I love that and it lasts on my lips
the entire day it does start to come off
in the center like it'll start to
crumble and fade in the center after a
few hours but I don't mind that because
I don't think it's phase in an ugly way
I love most of them in the range but
there are a few shades that I don't like
at all like some of these are really
terrible the darker colors are very
streaky they're awful I don't like them
but these three are my favorite this is
anything
I said it's the one I'm wearing and then
this one is a dreamy it's like a nude
pink so beautiful and this one is my
second favorite this one is in the shade
clear snow I love it it's like a warm
peachy nude so stunning these are
totally underrated like I said some of
them and also wood but these are really
good and then the last product I want to
talk about our essence lipsticks these
are essence as a brand is completely
underrated in my opinion I'm starting to
see a lot of people talk about them but
I feel like essence and Catrice our
brands and in my opinion have proven to
me to be better than maybelline or
l'oreal and then using those to compare
because when you go to the drugstore the
priciest brands are usually Maybelline
Revlon L'Oreal those more mainstream
drugstore brands Physicians Formula has
always been pricey but like man-made the
lane and L'Oreal they're getting up
there in price and I feel like to Treece
and essence yes they're not easy to find
I could only find them at Ulta so that
is really annoying but they're way more
affordable and they have a ton of
amazing products and I have just fallen
in love with almost every essence
lipstick I've tried I have a bunch of
different formulas their new matte matte
matte ones are really amazing I love
this color so much this in the shade
zero - I love all their lipsticks though
they're new ones they're creamy ones
they're matte ones essence is where it's
at four lipsticks and they're like two
to three dollars incredible okay guys so
that completes this video
these were products / brands that I
think are personally a little bit
underrated I made sure a lot of these
are spoken about on YouTube but I feel
like to have spoken about it though
leave me a comment down below with a
product that you think is not talked
about on YouTube that's super underrated
let me know and maybe I'll check it out
and maybe I include it in a future
underrated makeup products video oh yeah
like a complete video thank you guys so
