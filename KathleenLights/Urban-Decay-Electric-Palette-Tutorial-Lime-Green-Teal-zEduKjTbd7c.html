hey guys so today's video is another
tutorial using the Urban Decay electric
palette it is mainly well pretty much
only using thrash and gonzo so it's a
little bit wearable I feel I would
definitely go out and rock this and wear
this which I am today a bunch of you
guys did ask me if I could do some more
tutorials using this palette and of
course I will
absolutely why not I think people are
kind of afraid of that palette because
there's just so many crazy colors in it
but you don't have to use all of those
colors you can use different eyeshadows
with those colors more neutral ones more
wearable ones you could use that palette
for like a pop of color one day in the
spring and summer I just think that
people are a little bit overwhelmed with
the palette because there's so many
colors and like nothing neutral you can
kind of mix and match and you can come
up with wearable looks with that palette
believe it or not this look right here
may be wearable for some people and for
others it may be like whoa even that's
too colorful and too intense for me
so I mean it's all about preference some
people like it some people won't but
it's fun to experiment with colors I
feel since I'm a very neutral girl so
I'm really loving this palette so far so
if you want to see how to get this lime
green and teal look then just keep
watching okay let's do this I am priming
my eyes with Mac's painterly paint-pot
and I'm going to take this all over my
lid and up to my eyebrow then I'm going
to take an eyeshadow that is pretty much
the exact same color as my skin tone and
I'm going to put this all over my lid
and underneath my brow bone to highlight
as well
then I'm going to take an eyeshadow
that's just a couple shades darker than
my actual skin tone we're not even a
couple shades just like a shade darker
than my skin tone and I'm going to be
blending this into the crease and this
is going to be our transition color use
any eyeshadow you have now I'm going to
go into this color right here called
thrash and it's just a very intense lime
green and I'm taking it on a little
blending brush from Ecotools and I'm
going to be building this color into my
crease very very slowly I'm going to be
packing it on the outer part of my eye
and then bringing it into my crease and
I'm going to be doing this over and over
and over again this look especially
requires a lot of blending and just
going back and forth into that eye
shadow and building it up to the
intensity that you prefer so I'm going
to be doing that and I'm also going to
be dragging it up past my crease a
little bit just so that everything is
nice and blended and it's not a harsh
straight line just take your time with
this and build up that green color
little by little
I'm going to go back into that eye
shadow I use all over my lid and I'm
just going to add some more to my lid
because some of it did get blended away
I'm going to be doing this quite a few
times just going back and forth like I
said into the green intensifying the
green and then intensifying the lid
shade by the way if you are wondering
what I used on my lid and in my crease
they are the matte shadows from the Kat
Von D ladybird palette but you can use
whichever eyeshadows you own
now I need more precise blending brushes
stiff dome brush I'm going to take it
and dip it right into thrash and then
just apply it right into my crease to
intensify my crease a little bit more
really quickly I'm going to tightline
and I'm going to use my Maybelline
master drama in Midnight Master and then
I'm going to add my wing every time I do
my wing it gets out of focus I know I
suck but I just did a pretty thin wing
on top and then did a nice long flick
I'm going to go back into the eyeshadow
I use all over my lid one more time just
to intensify it because you know some of
it did get blended away and I'm going to
be focusing it on the center of my
eyelid and towards my tear duct
really quickly I'm going to curl my
lashes and use my Too Faced better than
sex mascara falsies would be more ideal
for this look but you guys know I don't
really use falsies that much but feel
free to use them I'm going to prime my
face with the maybelline baby skin and
then I'm going to go in with my
foundation it is the Rimmel stay matte I
use this like crazy it's honestly one of
my favorite drugstore foundations it's
just so easy to apply and I love that
Luci texture so I'm going to be applying
this all over my face
for underneath my eyes I'm going to use
my Maybelline fit me concealer and the
shade fair and I'm going to highlight
with this as well I'm going to be
blending that in with my Real Techniques
contour brush
to finish off my eye makeup I'm going to
go in with this Urban Decay eyeliner in
the shade main line which is a really
beautiful matte teal color and then I'm
going to be taking the brush that comes
with the electric palette and I'm going
to dip it into the shade gonzo and I am
just going to smudge this on my lower
lash line then I'm just going to blend
it out with a pencil brush so it's not
too harsh and it's nice and seamless the
mascara I'm going to be using for my
bottom lashes is the Clinique bottom
lash mascara to set my foundation I am
using my Mac MSF natural and medium and
I'm taking it on my ELF kabuki brush and
I'm just going to lightly dust this all
over my face to set my under eye
concealer I'm going to take this Mac
shaping powder in the shade emphasized
and this is just going to set my
concealer and brighten a little bit for
my bronzer i'm using my NYC sunny
bronzer and i'm not really doing a
specific contour anything just warming
up my face a bit
the blush I'm using is this Maybelline
master highlight highlighting blush in
the shade nude I'm obsessed with this
right now and I am taking this on my it
cosmetics blush brush and I am just
going to add just a touch of this on my
cheeks my lips I am taking this lipstick
by Mac called salute and it was limited
edition but just take any light peachy
shade you have I am dabbing it on my
lips because it is very very pigmented
and I don't want too much to come up on
my lips the gloss I'm using over top is
NYX creme brulee and then that completes
this makeup look I really hope you
