a makeup tutorial using the brand-new
Urban Decay electric palette which looks
like ah I don't know that was totally
unnecessary
I know anyway this isn't a full face
makeup tutorial just because I didn't
want the video to be so long since at
the end of the video I am going to be
doing a quick review on this and showing
you swatches and what I think of the
palette so I didn't want to go into a
full face of makeup and then do a review
and have this video be like 30 minutes
long mmm I'm like recipe today so yeah
if you want to see swatches and my
thoughts about this palette just stay
tuned to the end of video but if you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep on watching oh I have to show
you like my lip combo too though yeah
keep watching so the first thing I'm
going to do is take my lorac behind the
scenes eye primer and this is what I'm
going to use to prime my lids and then
I'm taking a lot of it underneath my
eyes because I am putting a lots of
eyeshadows underneath my eyes I'm just
gonna take my NYC sunny bronzer and I'm
going to use a little crease brush and
I'm going to add this to my lid just to
add some color to my eyelid so I'm
focusing that on my outer V and then
bringing it into my crease
I'm just going to continue to do this
until I have the intensity that I want
and I'm also going to be taking it a
little bit past the crease as well
now I'm going to take this color called
chaos from the pallet and on a small
little angled brush I'm going to be
adding some fix+ and then dipping it
into the eyeshadow and then I'm going to
be using this kind of like gel eyeliner
and I'm going to be creating a pretty
thick wing with this I recommend dipping
your brush into the powder first and
then adding fix+ because this is a matte
eyeshadow and it can get a little bit
gunky if you add water to it so I
recommend adding the fix plus after you
dip it into the shadow
so before I continue on with the wing
really quick I'm going to add some
eyeliner this is the Urban Decay eye
liner in the color chaos and I'm using
this to tighten line and I'm also going
to be adding this to my waterline as
well
okay so going back in to the chaos color
I am adding a little bit more fix+ to
just intensify it a bit and I'm going to
be adding a thick wing and I suck at
recording this because I always get out
of focus and it's just a big hot mess
but just add your wing just like you
were adding gel eyeliner then I just
went back into my bronzer and I added
some more into my crease just to
intensify it a little bit to give myself
a little bit more color for my highlight
I am using the elf baked highlighter in
moonlight and picture is called
moonstone one light I don't know I have
it down below
and I am using this in my inner corner
and underneath my brow bone as well I'm
going to take the brush that came with
the palette and I'm going to be dipping
it into the color chaos and running that
underneath my lower lash line but
staying on the outer half of my eye kind
of stopping where the pupil is and by
the way I didn't add any fix+ to this
part
then going into this shade right here
called gonzo I'm going to be taking it
on the same brush and then adding it in
the center of my lower lashline and then
bringing it all the way towards my inner
tear-duct just to kind of have it fade
from the light blue to the cobalt blue
then I'm going to flip the brush around
and with no additional product I'm just
going to be blending out these colors
just to make it a little bit more
seamless then with that same brush I am
going to be spinning it back into the
gonzo shade and adding some more just to
smoke it out and make it look like
really blown out underneath the lower
lash line
then I'm going to take this color right
here called revolt and I'm just going to
add this to my little tear duct area
just to give it some pizzazz add some
glitter and some I don't know you know
yeah I don't know just for fun I guess
I'm going to be using two different
mascaras I am using the Maybelline
colossal volume Express and the
Maybelline Rocket volume Express now I'm
also going to be using the rocket on my
lower lash line as well
from my lips I'm going to take Maxima
gentle lipliner and I'm going to fill in
my lips with this which is a really nice
vibrant pinky purple
for my lipstick I am using the Wet n
Wild mega lass lipstick in don't blink
pink and for my lip gloss I'm using the
revlon colorburst lip gloss in adorned
and that is it for this tutorial I hope
you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
watching okay guys so basically I think
this palette is phenomenal like it's
absolutely amazing first of all I'm just
going to talk about the packaging for a
second because the packaging is
incredible like is it they did such a
good job with this packaging it's like a
bunch of colorful smoke all over the
palate and it's great and it's sturdy
and it's I mistake by the way so excuse
the voice but it's sturdy and it's so
durable I feel like like I feel like
it's pretty durable and it comes with a
gigantic mirror like seriously this
mirror is so big it's great I love it
now talking about the actual product
these things are so intense these aren't
just your basic eyeshadows by the way
these are pressed pigments so they
aren't just your basic regular
eyeshadows there are ten times more
pigmented because they are pressed
pigments so you're definitely getting
amazing color payoff with this palette
every single eyeshadow has fantastic
color payoff every single one
the palette also comes with a double
ended brush and it is actually really
cute it's black and the bristles are
purple so cute I use this throughout the
entire tutorial in this video and I love
it like I think it's a great great brush
I see myself reaching for it a lot it
even packs on color onto your lid
beautifully people have been freaking
out because there's a disclaimer on the
packaging or on the box that some of
these pigments in this palette are not
used for your immediate eye area and it
is these four I'm pretty sure it's
slow-burn savage urban and guilted the
reddish the pain
and the Purple's they say it's not for
your immediate eye area but honestly
that's very typical for pigments I've
heard that so many times when it comes
to pigments so when I read that it
didn't really bother me I guess people
just didn't realize that that was the
case for some pigments I had never read
it on any packaging but I've heard
people like at Mac tell me that so I
mean it's a no big deal if you are a
little bit afraid just don't put them on
like your waterline or anything like
that but honestly I don't think your
eyes will get irritated from it
everybody has different skin so it's one
take my word for it but I've used it on
my eyes and I've used the Pink's on my
eyes before and I haven't had any
irritation personally and mama got
sensitive skin so I mean I've been doing
I've been doing pretty fine with these
I'm going to quickly swatch all of the
colors on my arms so you can see how
great and pigmented these things are
okay so this is the most Awkward
swatching I have ever done what
possessed me to put them on the side of
my arm no idea let's just roll with it
these are what the colours look like
they are insanely pigmented being
pressed pigments of course this one is
revolt it is a very intense shiny
silvery color it does have a little bit
of glitter in it like chunks of glitter
but if you wet this eyeshadow it goes on
like liquid metal seriously it's not wet
right now this is how it normally
swatches and it's still like gorgeous
love it
this one is gonzo right here it's a
beautiful blue this one here is called
slow burn and it is my second favorite
color in the palette I absolutely love
it it's beautiful this one is your
typical hot hot pink and this one is
called savage and this one is matte this
one has a little bit of glitter in it
but like barely noticeable it definitely
comes out matte on your eyelid this one
right here is called fringe and it is a
metallic teal type of color and it is
seriously stunning on the lid this one
is your typical cobalt blue and it is
called chaos this one right here is
called jilted it's also one of my
favorites because it has like a dual
chrome effect it
looks pink and it looks purple in
certain angles it's amazing this one
right here is a nice deep purple and it
is called urban this one right here it
is called freak and it is just like an
intense minty sort of minty green color
and then this one is my absolute
favorite one out of the entire palette
and it is called thrash and it is just
like an intense lime green it's not even
picking up how intense this color is in
person like oh my god
my favorite my favorite favorite
favorite so I hope this awkward angle of
swatching helped you in some way by the
way I do recommend using these colors
with a primer underneath even though
they are so intensely pigmented
definitely use a primer because if you
don't it will stay in your eyes like
you'll put the pink on try to take it
off and you're like oh god they're still
pink on my lid so definitely is a primer
once you use a primer there is no
staining at least I don't detect any
staining also if you want your
eyeshadows to be super super intense I
recommend using a white base and now
we'll just make them look crazy so
anyway I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
thank you so much for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
