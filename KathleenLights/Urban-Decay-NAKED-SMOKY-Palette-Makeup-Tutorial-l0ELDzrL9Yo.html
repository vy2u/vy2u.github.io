tutorial on Xena no Gomorrah wow this is
using the urban decay naked smoky
palette urban decay was nice enough to
send it to me before it was released and
I am pretty sure today I'm posting this
on the day that you can buy this so it
should be already available to purchase
on Urban Decay calm I know that on Ulta
calm it comes out in a few days but you
can buy it at Urban Decay today this
video isn't sponsored by the way I'm
just posting it on the day it's gonna be
released really quick let me just give
you like a mini review I love it I love
the packaging I love the packaging still
to this day my favorite packaging is the
original Naked palette I know that
everybody hates that packaging but I
love it and I despise the packaging on
the naked 2 &amp;amp; 3 and then when this one
came out I was so excited because it's
like a magnet it's not like a tin that
closes so I'm so glad that they changed
the packaging and honestly when I saw
this for the first time I was like wow
this is exactly what I wanted The Naked
2 to be I love the first one it's my
it's one my favorite palettes of all
time and the third one is beautiful it's
nice and rosy and then this one is what
I wanted the second one to be like a
smokey version I'm so happy they came
out with this I think it's worth it even
if you have the first one because it's
different it's deeper it's more cool
tone it's just started smoking so this
is the look I came up with I really
loved it for like a night out clubbing
or something I really like it so if you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep watching okay so the first
thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids
with Jessie's Girl I shadow primer I've
been really liking this lately then I'm
gonna take the eyeshadow called combust
this color is really close to my skin
tone only a little bit more pinky so I'm
just using this to set the eyeshadow
primer because that primer is a little
tacky I'm going into this white ish
shade which i think is called 13 and I'm
using this underneath my brow bone to
really highlight and lift the brow and
in my inner corners even though I'm
going in with a different color later
I'm gonna take this Milani Milani Milani
shadow eyes in black and I'm using this
as a base so I'm applying this to my
entire lid and then I'm gonna kind of
like you know move it around and try to
blend it with just a regular eye shadow
brush I'm sick by the way don't I sound
at that's why then I'm gonna take this
eye shadow called armor I love this
color because it has a ton of glitter
but the glitter actually shows up like
it's pigmented enough to where it shows
up I don't know it's really really
really pretty so I'm applying this to my
entire lid I just love how it looks with
a black base underneath cause it makes
it deeper
then I'm taking password' and I'm gonna
start blending this into my crease
because we put a black base down like a
harsh line kind of created on my eye so
I'm just going back and forth with the
eyeshadow password' taking my time and
really trying to blend those two
eyeshadows together it's gonna take some
time but you just have to a blend blend
blend I'm going right back into combust
with a fluffy brush with no products
with like no previous product just
combust and I'm blending everything
taking the purple in the palace it's a
good dark dark purple I think it's cause
I don't remember but I'm just using this
on the outer V of my eye it doesn't give
too much step but just enough like I
just want the outer corners to be just a
little bit deeper and I'm dragging some
of that into the crease just to help
blend some more I decided this look
would look really pretty with a wing a
big wing a small wing it doesn't really
matter but I'm just adding a small
little wing I want the eye shadows to
really stand out so I didn't want to go
too heavy with my wing now I'm just
applying a ton of roller lash mascara to
my bottom lashes and I'll finish the
rest of my eyes when I'm
my face okay so I decided to use this
for the first time this is from lush
cosmetics and it's called the skin tint
feeling feeling younger skin tint gives
your face like such luminosity it's very
similar to the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer
so yeah I put that on my face is like a
nice moisturizing luminizing stuff then
I went in with the Elsi Foundation and I
am in the shade sand I believe so yeah
that's what I'm putting on my face I
actually really like this foundation it
is matte and it can be a little heavy
but with a light layer it's actually
really really pretty and it looks nice
and matte and really pretty I like it I
dig it now I'm taking the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer and the Maybelline
fit me concealer mixing both of them
together just to get like a perfect
color and and then I will be blending
that out as per use
I'm also highlighting with the fit me
with my of course trusty sit on a lace
217 I feel like I talk about this all
the time but I love it it was sent to me
by a subscriber not even by the company
Sedona lace has no idea who the heck I
am but thank you so much because I
freaking love it now I'm going to set
that with a zoeva brush and I'm dipping
the brush into the Kat Von D shade and
light palette and I'm using the yellow
shade to set my concealer now I'm gonna
finish off the eyes I'm using the NYX
cheque
Johnny Lee I can't say black gel
eyeliner and then I'm gonna go in with
slate I've no password this is password
and with a pencil brush I am rubbing
that on my lower lashline to smoke out
the black eyeliner and then I wanted it
to be just a little darker so I'm taking
that color right there and just further
samokhin it out I'm applying some roller
lash mascara to my bottom lashes and
then I'm gonna plop on some falsies and
the falsies I use or the posh whisper
lashes then I'm gonna go into high this
is the first palette I mean the first
eyeshadow on the palette and actually
what the eyeshadow with a little bit
fix+
so it can be super intense and that's
what I applied to my inner corners now
I'm just gonna contour using the Kat Von
D shade light palette I'm using the more
cool tone color and an angled brush to
add some kanto to my cheekbones ah I
feel like my voice is going away I'm so
like I'm gonna go cold this sucks
now I'm gonna take the warmer shade in
the palette because when I have a tan to
my skin I don't like my contour to be
too ashy so I'm just adding a little bit
of warmth
the blush I'm using is tarts captivating
then for highlight I'm using this Sedona
lace duo
so don't let lace what the heck the
Sonia Kashuk duo
that has like a bronze and a highlight
so I'm using the pinky highlights for my
highlight it's super intense and super
beautiful I highly recommend this you
can get it at Target then I'm going to
take the l'oreal la lac um lippy thingy
in choco lac and i'm applying this to my
entire lips this is already glossy it's
like a lacquer finish but i wanted to
add some more gloss so I'm taking the
Sephora perfect the nude lip gloss and
I'm applying that on top so that
completes this look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it thank you guys so much

next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
