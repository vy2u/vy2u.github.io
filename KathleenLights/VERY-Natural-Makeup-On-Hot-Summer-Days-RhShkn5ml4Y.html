routine I have been wearing this like
the past couple days especially when I
go to the park or like when we go have
lunch outside and stuff it's so hot here
it's excruciating so I just don't wear a
lot of makeup recently unless I'm going
out at night then I just pull up on the
makeup cuz that's just how I am
but during the day I just I can't I
can't deal with so much makeup so I
filmed what I've been doing the past
couple days because I just think it
looks nice fresh and natural and I've
just been doing it so yeah ok so since I
am NOT doing much to my eyes at all I'm
going to start off with my face and I
have no foundation on I have nothing on
my face I have no makeup the only thing
on how on is some chapstick so first I'm
just going to take my little fix plus
and I'm going to spray my face
I love the mac fix+ I use it all the
time ok so the next thing I'm going to
use is some concealer I haven't been
wearing foundation in the last couple
days especially like when I use my
self-tanner
I don't know if you can tell but I help
like some self-tanner on I just feel
like I don't know I don't need
foundation I just need to cover up
whatever needs to be covered and then
I'm good to go so surprisingly enough I
have really been liking this little Gaby
concealer this is in the color buff this
came in an Ipsy bag I don't know when
but I hated it because I tried it
underneath my eyes and I was like whoa
that creases I don't like that but I've
been using it like on pit bulls and are
on my nose and it's been doing a really
good job so I'm going to take that
spread my finger in and kind of press it
without um without
blending it in Wow so yeah let's take
that without blending it in just put it
everywhere where I think I need to cover
and I'm filming my skincare routine next
week so if you're interested in seeing
my skincare routine that should be up
next week so yeah basically just dotting
it on like places where I get really red
like and on my nose and stuff like that
I tried this like mask last night that
you just not a mask you leave it on and
then you wipe it off after ten minutes
and the back of the bottle said it's not
suitable for sensitive skin so maybe I
should have listened to that but it kind
of gave me like little beard spots on
them nothing too crazy so yeah so then
I'm going to take my Maybelline instant
age rewind dark circle eraser I do still
use this I have like completely
abandoned this for my mac prolongwear
concealer but that is more of a full
coverage concealer and more for like you
know going out and stuff but I still do
use this like on a day-to-day basis but
I don't really want to wear makeup but
it does crease so my friend Malin taught
me a little trick to use like your your
eye primer underneath your eyes like
where your bags are to help it from
creasing so that's what I'm doing I'm
taking my Urban Decay primer potion
putting it underneath my eyes so that it
helps with creasing slopes up a little
tip thanks Malin and then I'm gonna add
some of the concealer
okay so now that I look absolutely crazy
I'm gonna take my damp Beauty Blender my
baby and I'm just gonna sponge
everything in
okay and that's pretty much it I love
the Beautyblender so much especially um
when you want to look like you have like
fresh dewy skin this just makes my skin
look really nice okay so next I'm just
going to take my Abbey concealer again
and I'm going to use this to cover the
veins on my eyelids because I get crazy
veins on my eyelids like crazy
so it's like I cover them completely
it's just going to mask them a little
bit which I'm okay with that okay so
moving on I'm gonna fill in my eyebrows
a little bit um I can't tell you the
trouble that I've been going through
with my eyebrows I'm using um cork I
shadow by Mac and just like an angled
brush like this you can see that yeah
and I'm just gonna lightly fill them in
I do not like harsh brows in the summer
it's just on my thing if you like that
you go for that but it's just not
something I enjoy in the summer and my
eyebrows I've said it millions of times
I know it's kind of annoying but they're
just not cooperating with me lately
I do my eyebrows down in Miami with an
amazing woman who does my eyebrows
beautifully if you live in Miami you
should definitely go to the Dragonfly
spa it's in Miami Lakes every time I do
my eyebrows they're the amount of
compliments I get on my eyebrows is
ridiculous
and she does an amazing job okay so
after I fell in my brows really quickly
I'm just going to set my under eye
concealer kind of forgot to do that five
minutes ago but that's what I'm doing
and I'm only putting powder on my eye
concealer just so that it won't crease
okay so I'm going to add some bronzer
and then I'm pretty much done with my
face I do love blush in the summer but
these past couple days like going to the
park and eating outside I have a little
pudding on bush and the bronzer I'm
using is the lorac bronzer in the color
bronze original but I really like this
bronzer in the summer because you can
tell I really like this bronzer okay pan
it's a huge it's huge it's like a
massive and I like it because it's kind
of like a red tone bronzer and it has
like a sheen to it and you can tell it
has like yeah it has a glowy sheen to it
and I really love these like a red tone
bronzer in the summer because I feel
like it looks more natural and it looks
like you have an actual Sun Tan where
you're kind of a little bit red and
bronzed at the same time I don't know
that's just me
here's a comparison this is my ELF
contouring blush and bronzing powder and
as you can see this is like a brown
bronzer and yeah side by side next to it
you see how red this bronzer is okay so
I'm going to be taking my Real
Techniques blush brush and I'm going to
be dipping it into this bronzer and just
bronzing my face a little bit
okay so I'm completely done with my face
and then I'm going to move on to the
eyes and I'm only doing two things to my
eyes first I'm taking my chela ivory
lace highlighter this came in the itse
bag this month yep and I'm just going to
highlight underneath my brow bone
and in my tear duct
and then I'm going to blend that in and
then lastly I'm just adding mascara and
I'm going to contradict myself right now
if you saw my products I regret buying
video I said that I really really hated
the Jordana best lash extreme and I
really did but I just put it in my
drawer and I kept it for some reason I
don't know what made me keep it but I
did and then a couple days ago I used it
again and I was like oh it's not too bad
I think I needed to let it dry a little
bit I think it was too wet at first when
I first bought it and I made my lashes
really really clumpy and what helps is
if I bend the one like this I only do it
with this mascara because I don't know
for some reason I better get codes my
lashes better when I bend it like this
and then I have to scrape off all of the
like excess mascara back into the tube I
don't have to do this with any of my
other mascaras but with this one I just
really have to do that so if you don't
like this because it's too clumpy it
gives up too much product just like wipe
it on the tube get the product out and
yeah I actually really enjoy it now that
I found these little tricks and found
how to use it so I'm just going to go
ahead and apply my mascara
okay I actually really like it now and I
think it's because bending like this is
a pretty good trick it helps you coat
your lashes and taking off all the extra
gunk doesn't make it clump that much as
you can see I actually really like this
mascara now who would've thought okay
and then lastly for my lips I am using
the maybelline color whisper and petal
rebel this is like the perfect little
pop of pink and these feel so
moisturizing and they're perfect for
summer I love them and then of course
last but not least I'm just going to
give my little spritz of fix+
and that's it okay guys so this was my
fresh and natural summer makeup routine
I hope you enjoyed it please subscribe
for more videos and I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
