don't know
we can do
came together
if we just try hey guys so today's video
is a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now I got really really
requested to do a Valentine's Day makeup
tutorial but there's just so many people
uploading them right now that I don't
know if I wanted to but I thought you
know what I'm gonna sit down and film
the look that I'm gonna wear I'm Milan
times day so this is what I'm gonna wear
it's extremely extremely easy it's like
the easiest I look in the history of the
world it's so easy which is why I wanted
to show you guys if you are someone who
is just starting out in makeup or you
struggle a little bit with your
eyeshadow I think this video is perfect
for you because anyone can do this I
look absolutely anyone because I mean it
is so easy and basic but I love looks
like this on Valentine's Day I love red
lips for Valentine's Day it's my
favorite and I know that red lips are
extremely typical for Valentine's Day
but I like it
I like I think this makeup look is
beautiful for any date night you could
switch up the lip color you could
literally it's Christmas you could
honestly wear any lip color with this
look absolutely any so you do what you
want on the lips
I just love red of course so if you want
to get this really really simple and
glowy Valentine's Day makeup then just
keep watching okay so I'm going to start
off with my face since my eyes are so
simple I'm taking the dr. Brandt pores
no more I bought this because of Nicole
Guerrero so I'm just trying it out and
I'm going to fill in my pores with this
my foundation of choice today is the
L'Oreal Lumi cushion foundation I'm
going to give you guys my thoughts
really quick this is such a beautiful
finish on my skin but I'm in the shade
w2 and it's so weird you can't tell here
in this clip but it's a little bit pink
which is weird since it's w2 it's like
the strangest thing it's only a little
bit pink not something that's super
noticeable but yes it gives a beautiful
nice like fresh finish to the skin and
it has really really good coverage so
I'm just applying that to my entire face
for concealer I'm going to mix two of
them I'm going to take my la girl Pro
conceal in the shade natural and I'm
going to apply this really really close
to my lashes because my dark circles
were pretty bad and this shade in
natural has like a really pretty peachy
undertone so for the rest of my face
like highlight I'm going to take the
bare minerals stroke of light in the
shade luminous - it's basically just
like a highlighting concealer and I
don't know if I like it it kind of caked
up on top of this foundation I'm still
going to give it another try because
I've never tried it
on top of another foundation because
this was literally the first time I used
that stroke of light thing but I was
like looking in the mirror and it just
seemed pretty cakey and I know it wasn't
my la girl concealer because that's like
a Holy Grail concealer of mine so I
don't know if it was the combination of
this foundation and the bare minerals
thing but it's not my favorite so far
okay so I'm setting my face or my under
eye concealer with of course my trusty r
SE ma no color powder and this is going
to help my concealer from creasing so
I'm going to go ahead and do my eyes I'm
going to take my smashbox 24-hour eye
primer and apply that to my entire lid
and then i'm going to take this Milani
almond cream the crayon stick thing and
I'm going to apply this to my whole lid
just so that - my whole lid that sounded
weird just so that I can cover up all
the veins and stuff okay so the palette
I'm going to be working with is the Too
Faced natural matte palette we're going
to take the shade heaven and I'm going
to set that base I put down and now I'm
taking the shade nudie and I'm buffing
that on the outer corners of my eye with
a nice fluffy brush and I'm just packing
this on the outer corners just so that
it shows up a little bit since it's a
little bit light so I'm just packing
that on buffing it out and then I'm
going to start blending this into my
crease and this is pretty much the only
shadow we're putting on the lid just so
that I can have a little bit of
dimension in my crease then I'm going to
highlight underneath my brow bone with
the shade heaven the one I used first
and I'm also applying that to my inner
corners as well
okay so I'm going to takes expresso sex
press oh I find that so hard to say it's
like a tongue twister I don't know and
I'm taking this on a flat definer brush
and I'm just applying this really really
close to my lower lashes and really
really close to my top lashes kind of
acting like a nice brown eyeliner but I
mean we're going to go over it here in a
second so I'm going back into new T and
I'm just buffing that on my lower lash
line you know nothing fancy just
applying some eyeshadow there and I'm
going to take a black eyeshadow this is
wet and wild Panther eyeshadow it's
literally like a dollar and it's super
black but I'm taking this on an angled
brush this brush is from Sigma and I'm
just pretending like if it's a gel liner
and I'm creating a really soft messy
type of wing I really like doing these
looks especially if you have a hard time
with gel or liquid liner this gives you
the illusion of a wing but it's much
softer and I just think it's really
pretty so that's what I'm doing I'm just
creating a nice little wing as usual
like you would do with any liner and it
just looks softer I don't know I like it
and then I just kind of extended the
tail a little bit so it looks nice and
long and then we're pretty much done
with that wing it was so easy so I'm
taking Kashmir bunny and I'm just
buffing that on my lower lashes just to
give a little bit more depth I wanted it
to look a little bit smoky there I'm
going to apply some black eyeliner on my
waterline and my tight line as well this
is black velvet from Urban Decay this is
gonna define the eyes just a little bit
more then I used my Mac extended play
gigablack lash on my top and lower
lashes and I'm letting my glue dry but I
wanted to show you guys the lashes I'm
using they are posh laster's posh lashes
in the shade within the WoW in the style
wispy I'm not even going to edit that
I'm just gonna leave that in okay I'm
taking my color pop highlight in the
shade smoke and whistles and applying
that to the tops of my cheekbones with
my finger and then I took my Physicians
Formula butter bronzer
that is the song I sing in my head every
single time I open this bronzer because
it smells like a tropical paradise but
anyway I'm using this to contour because
I really like the undertone and I used a
Sephora Pro airbrush in this in this and
what in the number 54
that is the number of this brush number
54 I took a stippling brush and I dipped
it into my Kiko flawless fusion bronzer
I just wanted to add a little bit more
warmth to my face so I'm just applying
this all over my face and then I had to
change my Spotify because a really
emotional song came on if you are a
Vampire Diaries fan and if you are a
Stefan fan that song hits home it was a
very emotional episode but anyway I'm
applying Mac warms all who's texting me
I'm applying Mac warm soul to my face
and this voiceover is a hot mess but I'm
also highlighting my face with Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in Champagne
puff and I'm just using a zoeva
highlighting brush to highlight my face
of course and then I forgot something in
my drawers and I wanted to do a little
dance but I wanted to grab my girl
lactic face glow in the shade natural
because I wanted to be extra glowy
so I took my Real Techniques a blush
brush and I'm just pretty much applying
this face glow all over my face just to
be extra glowy okay so to finish off the
look I'm going in with a red lip this is
a mac prolongwear lip liner in the shade
he-said he-said she-said why is that
hard for me to say I don't know but
while I sing to Selena Gomez I am going
to apply my Milani amore matte lip cream
in the shade desire it's a liquid
lipstick and I love it so that completes
this makeup tutorial I hope you guys
enjoyed it this is what I'll be wearing
on Valentine's
