know like after the time changed now it
gets darker earlier and stuff like that
I didn't realize that when I sat down to
film I should have filmed a lot earlier
in the day but I didn't and then it got
really dark I don't know if you can tell
but it's super dark in this room so I'm
so sorry that the lighting is so dark it
started getting darker towards like the
middle end of the tutorial so I'm so
sorry but today's video is going to be a
makeup tutorial on the makeup look I'm
wearing right now and it is using the
makeup geek Vegas lights palette I'm
trying to take your requests into
consideration and when I posted that
huge like makeup geek collection video I
got tons of requests to do a look using
the Vegas lights palette so that is what
I'm doing today and I know I know I keep
saying this but I know you guys
requested the look that I was wearing in
that video like in my makeup geek video
and I tried to recreate it last night
and it was totally off
I remember the eyeshadows I used but I
don't remember how like I placed them
and stuff like that so it didn't look
the same that's why there wasn't a video
Wednesday morning like midnight when I
usually post because that video did not
turn out the way it was supposed to but
yeah I will try again I will try again
anyway side no I know that some of you
are like how come your bloops are not in
all your videos and stuff like that
sometimes I don't have bloopers like
sometimes things go smoothly and I don't
have bloopers and I don't want to make
up bloopers I got I want to sit there I
pretend like I have a bunch of bloopers
when I don't so I only add Zee bloops
when Zee bloops happen sometimes the
Blues don't happen but yeah anyway I'm
rambling at this point I know this is
very me this is very warm I do look like
this all the time well you do the same
looks all the time
but it was requested to use this palette
and this palette is very warm so that's
why it's another warm I shadow we look
because it's using the pellet that was
requested to use so don't be mad at me I
am gonna be posting like a silver black
smokey eye soon a lot more cooler tone
looks I know I keep saying that but
seriously they're in the works anyway if
you want to see how to get this boot
just keep watching okay so you guys know
I always start off with my eyebrows
already painted I have an eyebrow
tutorial up on my channel if you're
interested but the first thing I'm doing
is I'm going to prime my eyelids and I
am using the LA girls Pro primer you can
get la girls at drugstore calm I love
this primer it's actually really good
and it masks the veins on my eyelids I'm
going to take the Vegas lights palette
and the first eyeshadow I'm using is
desert sands it's probably one of my
favorite colors in this palette it's
beautiful it's like a vomity kind of
brown it's amazing so I'm just adding
that color into my crease kind of like a
transition shade but I was pretty much
putting it everywhere I'm taking this
eyeshadow called roulette and then I get
excited because it's so pigmented like
it's crazy pigmented roulette is a
beautiful like reddish coppery burgundy
I don't know it's gorgeous
and I'm using my ELF $1.00 brush which
is actually pretty good if you ask me so
I'm just packing that on my entire lid
right up to the crease then I'm going to
take this fluffy brush this is a morphe
brush and I'm dipping it back into that
desert sands color and I'm going to rub
this back and forth into my crease and
what this is
do is going to blend the roulette shade
and kind of help it melt into the desert
sand shades a little bit now this look
doesn't require fix+
but I just wanted to add just a little
bit to intensify it just a little bit
more this eye shadow is very pigmented
on its own but I just added a little bit
of fix plus a little bit of pizzazz then
with this Ecotools brush I'm taking the
fluffy side because it's a dual ended
brush and I'm going to dip it right back
into desert sands and I'm just going to
start packing this into my crease I'm
using a smaller crease brush to make it
a little bit more precise in the crease
then I'm going to take Mirage and this
is going to be my brow bone highlight
this color is so pigmented I love it and
I'm going to take a little wipe and I'm
going to clean up the edges like I
usually do make it a little bit sharp at
the edges you could always use tape but
I just clean it I'm going to take this
Stila eyeliner in the shade damsel i
believe and i'm going to tightline with
this and I'm going to use this as my
water on my waterline as well this is
just a brown eyeliner then I'm going to
take the pigment called liquid gold this
is also from makeup geek this is a super
intense green gold pigment like really
intense and I'm going to put that in my
inner corner kind of like in a little
triangle shape kind of make it like
sharp does that make sense well you see
it's like a little triangle and then I'm
going to add a link to the outer part of
my eye kind of like where you would
normally put eyeliner just a little bit
different I guess if that makes sense
I'm not very good at explaining but you
can see here then I'm going to take my
Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and just
add a little flick you guys know every
time I try to do my eyeliner on camera I
get way too close to the mirror and then
I get on a frame but here I'm just
priming my face but before finish up my
eyes and I'm using my cover FX calming
primary to do that then I'm going to put
on some foundation and I forgot to show
it to you this is the Neutrogena Healthy
Skin Foundation in the shade 40
and I love this foundation it's
definitely one of my favorite drugstore
foundations I'm just going to buff that
all over my face using a zoeva brush
then I'm going to add some under-eye
concealer this is the Maybelline instant
age rewind dark circle eraser in the
shade fair and I'm just adding like that
triangle shape to highlight as well it's
a further highlight I am taking the
Maybelline magic Lumi pen
I believe that's what it's called magic
Lumi pen and I'm just gonna highlight my
face even more on my nose my forehead
around my mouth you know the places
where you would normally highlight and
then I'm just gonna blend that out with
the same foundation brush
I'm actually going to take this product
right here this is the NARS contour
powder in Paloma and it also comes with
like a highlight shade that's completely
matte so I'm going to take that
highlight shade and I'm going to set my
under eye concealer with this thank you
to everyone who said that this brush was
perfect for setting my under eye
concealer because I was like oh I don't
like this brush it's too little for
blush but you guys were like no I use
that brush to set my under eye concealer
and it works great this is the elf blush
brush and you guys are the best I'm
going to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones with this Mac cream-colored
base in the shade pearl and I'm just
using my fingers to stipple this on my
face because it is a cream product going
back to finish off my eyes I'm just
going to smoke out the lower lash line
I'm taking that bada bing shade with the
other side of that Ecotools brush and
I'm just applying it to my lower lash
line to even out the look and make it
smokier and then I'm going to take
desert sands and further smoke it out
then I'm going to add some bottom
mascara well mascara to my bottom lashes
and I use the Maybelline lash discovery
mascara to do that and then I'm going to
go ahead and just take that same NARS
Paloma contour powder and then I'm going
to contour my face and this is a zoeva
and I grab it it is a zoeva 101 brush
and that is what I'm using to contour my
face by the way I also added mascara to
my top lashes and I forgot to record
that but I used the Mac and extreme
dimension 3d black lash mascara I'm
trying to give my lashes a break from
falsies for a little while let's see how
long that lasts but I've been on a no
falsies kick for a while now well like a
couple weeks the blush I'm using is this
NYX blush in terracotta it's become a
new obsession I love it it's a nice
bronzy warm beautiful peachy amazing
blush then to finish off my look I'm
going to take this girl lactic lipstick
in the shade naked and I'm just
stamp this on my lips a little bit just
so not that much pigment comes off just
as a base color and then I'm going to
take this NYX soft matte lip cream in
Cairo and I'm just going to put this on
top and it's going to make it even more
nude Cairo by itself is a little bit too
nude so I like adding the lipstick with
it it's a nice little combo okay guys so
if that completes this look the you guys
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
