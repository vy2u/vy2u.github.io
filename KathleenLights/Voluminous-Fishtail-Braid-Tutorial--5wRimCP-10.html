tutorial on this hair right here I never
do here tutorials I think I've done like
maybe four or less on my channel since I
started my channel I'm just not very
good at the full hair thing but I have
been doing this hairstyle a lot recently
and I decided to share with you guys
it's a very thick and voluminous messy
fishtail braid it is kind of complicated
but once you get the hang of it it's
really really easy I actually learned
how to do a fishtail braid watching
youtube videos so it's possible and I'm
actually probably the world's worst
fishtail braid explainer so if you don't
get it with my tutorial you can just
search for more tutorials on how to do a
fishtail braid and they would probably
explain it better but anyway I just
wanted to share this with you guys
because I think this hairstyle is super
summery and appropriate for this time of
year and it's just so beautiful I love
it I am wearing extensions in this
tutorial because I like my braid to be
extra thick but you can use your regular
hair you don't have to use extensions
and you'll get the same result only
it'll just be a little bit thinner but
you can fan it out and make it thick
anyway I also wanted to talk about the
extensions I'm wearing I am wearing SKR
extensions I only have two clips and so
I'm not wearing like a full head of
extensions or anything but a couple of
you guys have asked me what I think
about these extensions so I wanted to
give you like a mini review of these
extensions as well as this tutorial so I
hope you guys don't mind I wanted to
kill two birds with one stone and I'm
sorry I'm so dark it has been raining in
Florida like like the world is ending
it is raining a lot but rain or shine
won't stop me from posting videos no
siree Bob
they won't okay so I'm gonna stop
blabbing now by the way I did film a
tutorial on this look right before I
filmed this hair tutorial just in case
you guys wanted to see a tutorial on
this so I filmed it before I'm like let
me film this just in case they want to
see it tutorial on it so if you do want
to see a tutorial on this look then just
comment down below and I will post it
for you guys so yeah enough with the
blabbing if you guys want to see how to
get this really thick and beautiful
fishtail braid then just keep watching
okay so these are what the extensions
like there is a shadow right here as
always ignore that but these are what
the extensions look like I believe these
are medium mixed blonde or dark mixed
blonde I'm not exactly sure I will put
in the description box exactly what
color these are but I love these
especially because they have highlights
throughout them so it's two different
tones it has like this Auburn e Brown
and then the blonde highlights which
doesn't look like it would match but it
does match my hair it just looks like I
have blonde highlights throughout the
bottom of my hair which I love and they
mix in beautifully because if you see
right here they look kind of fake
looking as in the strike it's like brown
blonde brown blonde I was a little
worried about that I was like oh my god
that's gonna look kind of like stripy
and weird but it doesn't it blends in
your hair really really nicely like they
look so natural but as you can see it
comes with a lot of hair well I don't
know if you can tell but it's pretty
thick it's actually very thick like my
hair feels ten times thinner than this
when it's in a ponytail so it's very
thick good quality and I believe I have
the 20 inch 185 grams so it is the
longest ones that STR carries and my
hair is pretty long to begin with this
is just a little bit longer but I really
honestly wanted extensions for volume
because my hair is really really flat
when it's straight as you can see it
just like lays flat on my head there's
no volume and I've tried everything
so I really wanted extensions just to
give myself that extra volume to my hair
especially when I do braids like today
and certain hairstyles that I just want
my hair to look thicker and more
voluminous so yeah just to give you a
quick little review before I go on to
the actual tutorial like I said these
are SKR extensions and I've had them for
about two weeks now and I haven't
watched them I don't plan on watching
them for a while you shouldn't wash your
extensions all that much but I've earned
them I haven't curled them yeah but I've
ironed
and they feel so amazing they feel
healthier than my hair well my hair is
pretty damaged but they feel so healthy
and thick and pretty and I don't get
shutting at all actually first heard of
STR through my friend Gabby she's had
her extensions for about a year now and
she swears by them she says they're her
holy girl extensions so I'm glad I got
the opportunity to get these and
honestly so far so good I will keep you
updated on these extensions I know I've
only had them for two weeks so I mean
but so far so good so even though it
comes with a bunch of different West
two of them at least for this specific
hairstyle I do just because I want my
braids to just be a little bit more full
and thick so I don't feel the need to
put in all the hair extensions and
honestly wearing all of the clips in my
head gives me a headache and I don't
understand how anyone can wear like a
full head of extensions it like drives
me nuts I use this one right here that
has the two clips it's like a medium
sized one this one goes on the bottom
towards the bottom of my head and then I
use this one which is the biggest one
that comes with that it comes with three
clips so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and
clip in my extensions really quickly
you
by the way these are super easy to clip
and you just place them and clip them in
there really really easy
and then the larger one I just clip it
kind of like in the middle of my head on
top of my ear
you
and then I just make sure that nothing
is peeking through
and then I instantly have more volume so
as you can see this color blends really
good with my hair it just looks like I
have some blonde highlights peeking
through at the bottom which I really
really like so you can see it's pretty
much the same length of my hair only I
have layers so it kind of like blends in
all together I love these so the first
thing I'm gonna do is grab all my hair
towards this side of my head if you want
to do your braids on this side you
obviously do it on this side but yeah
I'm just gonna go ahead and grab
everything over here and secure it with
a tiny little black elastic and tying it
as close to my head as possible
you
okay so we have that part finish then
I'm going to take some bobby pins these
are like for the blonde ones they match
better with my hair than the black ones
and I am just gonna pin my hair in place
you
so yeah I'm just gonna fit in like this
I'm a little bit self-conscious about my
ears they're very very pointy so I like
my hair to cover my ears but if you
don't like that then you do it however
you'd like to do it okay so now I'm just
gonna start doing the fishtail to do it
you just want to part your hair into
even parts it doesn't ru perfectly even
but just you can feel it and then all
you want to do is start grabbing a
little section of each section I'll show
you I'm terrible at explaining so I'll
show you I'm just gonna take my finger
and grab a hair from this section I'm
gonna grab it from the back I'm gonna
grab a little little pieces of hair the
smaller the sections are that you grab
the better it's going to look because
then it's really gonna look like a
fishtail if you grab like phat sections
it'll look like a regular braid so make
sure that they're nice and small
sections
okay so I'm just gonna fast-forward
through this because if not it would be
way too long but basically I'm just
grabbing little sections of hair from
both sections so I'm gonna take my
finger cross it over grab a little piece
of hair take my other finger cross it
over grab a little piece of hair it's
really really simple it actually is well
not easier than a regular braid but it's
just as easy as a regular braid so once
you get the hang of it it's super super
easy so like I said just grab tiny
sections if you want it to be like
different fill out the whole braid grab
smaller sections and then thicker
sections or just do whatever makes you
feel comfortable I'm sorry if I really
don't know how to explain it it's kind
of hard to explain now that I think
about it it's just easier to do it I'm
sorry I'm terrible but yeah I'm just
gonna do that all the way towards the
bottom and then secure it with a little
elastic I'm not doing it to the very
tips of my hair because I do have layers
and I don't want the layers to just like
go crazy all the way at the bottom so
I'm just gonna leave a space before I
tie it with the elastic
so this is what you should be left with
when you're done again it does not have
to be perfect and super symmetrical
because that is what I think makes it
pretty you know like a nice messy braid
plus we will be pulling some and making
it a little bit thicker in just a second
so you can go ahead and cut the elastic
and make it even more loose and more
messy but I'm just gonna keep mine in
because I like to have it more secured
in the back and not so loose but you
know it's all about preference so now
I'm just gonna start pulling on the
braid and making it a little bit more
messy
okay so after you've got it as thick and
messy as you want it I'm gonna go ahead
and spray some hairspray so everything
stays in place and I am using my
favorite hairspray it is the healthy
sexy hair soy soy coachable no soy
touchable weightless hairspray I love
this because it doesn't leave my hair
crispy I hate that so I'm just gonna go
ahead and spray someone with Oh on my
face and then that's it you're good to
go your hairstyle will stay in place all
day I love this look I think it looks
elegant and casual at the same time like
you could wear this with a beautiful
dress and look super elegant or wear
this to the movies and still look good I
love this hairstyle I haven't been doing
it like crazy recently so I decided that
I would give you guys a little tutorial
on it thank you guys so much for
watching I really hope you enjoyed this
even though I'm not very good at the
hair tutorials thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
