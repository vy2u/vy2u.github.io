a cat chats video but not a typical cat
chats where I'm doing story times or
anything like that
today I'm kicking it back I'm kicking it
way back like 2008 2009 YouTube days we
are doing a what I got for Christmas
video and it's so funny because when I
first started watching YouTube when I
was in high school this was such a
popular video after the holidays like
every beauty influencer was posting what
I got for Christmas videos which is so
funny because back in the day I really
really did not like these videos at all
I never used to watch them because I
always thought they were a little bit
braggy they kind of were a little showy
and I really wasn't my cup of tea
but I've kind of been missing old
YouTube like the old Beauty videos we
used to see all the time back in the day
and I don't know I got some really cute
thoughtful gifts from my friends and
family but I really just wanted to share
with you guys today for some strange
reason and I thought why not I actually
tweeted a little while ago I asked you
guys if you wanted to see this video and
a ton of you guys were like yes do it
bring back old school videos so that's
what we're doing today and I don't want
this video to come off Bragi or showy or
anything like that I wanted to show you
guys just like the cute little things my
friends and family got for me that just
I don't know if it touched my little
heart and I love them it was a boring
video I'm sorry I have way more beauty
videos planned I actually tweeted you
guys if you wanted to see this video or
my best of skincare and hair care of
2017 and Lahti I said both so that video
will be coming soon as well and I would
love to know what you guys got for
Christmas if you guys celebrate this
obviously I know there are ton of people
who do not celebrate Christmas we do in
my family and if this video is not your
thing I totally get it I will catch you
in the next video okay so if there's one
thing I realize this Christmas is that
people really do understand my obsession
for dogs and socks those are a few of my
favorite things actually got to dog cups
from my friends this one I got from
Danny's cousin Jackie whose birthdays
actually the exact same day is mine now
that has anything to do with Christmas
but that's pretty cool so I got this Cup
it is
cute I love it it says I only want two
dogs but then two is crossed out and it
says three four seven ten
don't judge me and that looks like a
tiny little Corgi doesn't it I love
corgis this Cup is so cute I have so
many mugs in my kitchen I actually have
to go through and get rid of so many
because there are so many cups I don't
even use in my kitchen I have to make
way for new stuff I really like
thoughtful gifts are when people get you
things that relate to you it's just it's
so thoughtful nice I love this Cup
I got this one from my other friend this
one cracks me up it says I work hard so
my dog can have a better life but it's
so funny oh wait I think I'm losing my
voice I was screaming all night on the
31st so I woke up and my voice was it
he's a bit gone but this cup is so funny
I think I'm gonna put this one in my
beauty room I'm gonna put like eyeliners
or something in this and then I'm gonna
use the other one to drink out of
speaking of dogs I also got dog socks
from Jackie how cute these socks are I
love these I don't really mention this
on my channel but I am addicted to socks
all I do is walk around my house and
socks I'm rarely ever wearing shoes I'm
home most of the time and I live in
socks and all of my socks have holes and
then so I'm so excited I got so many
socks for Christmas because now I can
throw away all the ones with poles on
them
I like the colors on this one it says
fashion boutique on the socks but I have
no idea where she got them and then you
get this one and this one is dog doesn't
have any eyes this is definitely
hands-down one of my favorite things I
got for Christmas this year this was a
gift from my brother and his wife my
favorite animal in the world is a dog
but my second favorite animal is an
elephant his love elephants they're so
beautiful I have a lot of elephant
things in my room and Becky thought this
would be perfect for a PT room which it
is because I love plants especially ones
that don't take a lot of maintenance
because I'm very lazy so I love little
succulents this is gonna look so cute in
my meter oh I love this pot it's so cute
Porter please enough with the growling I
got these puppies and I freaking love
these one time Danny's dad was in the
hospital and he brought back like these
hospitals so he brought back like four
packs of those Hospital socks and they
were red and they had like the little
rubber thingies on the bottom so that
when you walk it grips onto the floor
you don't slip and I became obsessed
with those Dan Hospital socks and I
love the fact that they have the little
rubber ease on the bottom so she got me
these little like bootie socks with the
little rope rates on the bottom which
are my favorite because they don't fall
even though I really do enjoy running
really fast and then sliding with my
socks sometimes I act a little bit more
like an adult and I don't do that and
then these come in handy and then these
are very similar in the sense that they
also have little rubber ease at the
bottom which I love these are like
insane these are like socks on steroids
right here they're so warm and comfy
especially now that for some reason it's
freezing in Miami it's like a major cold
front and my body cannot handle it so
I'm gonna have a lot of fun in these
socks tonight my friend Stephanie got
these from me and I'm pretty sure she
got them at Target right that's like the
exhilaration brand is that Target I
think if your feet are cold
go ahead Target and pick these up
because wow wow oh I want to show you
the epic shirts I got for Christmas yes
start off with the one I'm wearing my
friend Millie got me this Pink Floyd
shirt I love it it's a crop top it's so
comfy I think she got it at forever 21
and I nearly squealed when I saw it you
guys know my love for pink floyd shirts
it's like a thing i have with my dad and
i just love anything that says pink
floyd on it like i'll wear it and then i
got this one the any stepsister got me
this one look at these I mean do I even
have to tell you of course I don't
it's from Hot Topic love t-shirts I love
graphic t-shirts but I nearly almost
peed when I saw this one because I don't
have any graphic tees about this show at
all and you guys know who I am I love
buying graphic tees based on the shows
I'm watching based on my obsessions it's
just a thing so if I thought it didn't
have anything at all about this and now
I do I was really excited how epic is
this shirt this is the most a big
supernatural shirt ever I love it
Danny's cousin Alex gave it to me it's
so awesome they look so young though
look at Sam look at that he's a little
baby in this picture I love this I
really really really love this and it's
so funny because Danny's cousin I are
always talking about supernatural it's
like one of his favorite shows so when
he caught me this almost like oh my god
I was I left so hard my mom got me this
shirt mainly to work out and I'm trying
my best to stay active in 2018 I kind of
fell off the workout
back in a little bit last year last year
it's so weird to say I was doing really
good there with my workout and then I
kind of fell off you know how the
holidays go away but I need to get back
on it but anyway my mom got me this
shirt like to work out and when I read
it I was like run the world okay mom and
she was like yeah you run the world it
was just so funny to me because you know
mom's always give you way more credit
than you deserve but yeah my mom got me
a little workout shirt something cute
hello ever oh my god look how cute this
is this is one of my favorite gifts as
well my friend got me a whiner dog I
don't really love like alcohol like
liquor I'm not I like beer I like I do
like beer but I'm not like a heavy beer
drinker I love wine preferably red wine
but I just love wine and these are the
little wine markers that you put on your
wine glass to identify your drink so no
one else drinks out of your cup know
exactly what cup belongs to you these
are those little wine markers but
they're wiener dogs so they're whiner
dogs I really like the brown one the
most because it looks like a little poop
swirl my sister got me the cutest
necklace you guys know she has her own
jewelry line and she made me this
necklace which almost made me freakin
cry because I have been wanting a
cursive name for so long like a
nameplate in cursive and she finally got
one for me but it's even more special
because it doesn't see my name it says
mama which is my name my whole life like
growing up my nickname is mama and I've
mentioned that a few times on my channel
but that is what my entire family calls
me even my sister's friends growing up
would refer to me as mama like I don't
think I've ever heard of nobody my
family say my name like kathleen i I
don't think so it's so weird but to me
mama is like more my name than Kathleen
is and she got me a little nameplate
that says mama and I absolutely love it
I've already worn it so many times it's
so pretty thank you I love it so so much
and speaking of Micra says Danny also
got me a necklace that I already broke I
am a savage and you guys know I talk a
lot with my hands and in the middle of
me telling a story I like ripped my own
necklace off so Danny has to
pack and get it fixed but I really
wanted to show you guys because this is
my favorite little gift he got me it was
just so creative and the fact that he
came up with it what I'm sure he likes
saw it somewhere I don't know I didn't
picture him getting a necklace like this
but it's so cute because it is the
infinity sign which if you guys don't
know Denny and I both have the same
tattoo on our back
we both got these matching infinity
tattoos when we first got married so we
always talked about how like that's our
symbol and this necklace is so cute it
has the infinity sign with our names in
it so it has my name here at the top and
then his at the bottom when I opened the
box I almost cried I was like oh my gosh
is so creative I love it and it's so us
you know like it represents us so well
so it was my favorite little gift I got
on Christmas okay so I'm just gonna go
ahead and get the rest of the socks out
of the way I have four pairs to show you
when one of them comes in a pack and
those are my Space Jam socks I think out
of all the socks I got I was the most
excited for these damn Space Jam socks
these were a gift from Danny's dad I
freaking love Space Jam it's one of my
favorite movies look at these socks
these are freaking epic socks but look
at these how cute look at the youth look
at these don't ever call me doll now of
course you got the other guys Classic
Space Jam peeps I got the cutest little
avocado socks these are from Target they
say let's have a cuddle which I freaking
love I walk out there it's like the best
side dish besides french fries so good
and then look how cute these are these
are constellation socks my friend really
got me these and I'm pretty sure I saw
them on Amazon and I thought they were
so cute and then she got them for me for
Christmas I was like oh my gosh I almost
bought that for myself but I love him
these socks are really cute and then my
sister-in-law got me these I love the
colors on these socks but they are
Aquarius socks you can see it has like
the aquarius constellation on the socks
and then it has the little aquarius
symbol here at the top these are so
pretty like I love the colors really
really nice yeah those were all the
socks I got for Christmas which seems
like a lot but now I can get rid of so
many they have giant holes around the
totals anyway we're almost done we have
three more gifts this was also one of my
hair it gifts I got this one was a gift
from Danny's brother Eric their elephant
their elephant figurines but it's the
hear no evil see no evil speak no evil
and I really really love this
I can't wait to display these in my
living room I think they're so nice like
a little really beautiful elephants and
I love the whole see no evil speak no
evil hear no evil thing feel like I like
to base my life on that it's really
great advice and I just love these so
much Erik it just really knows how to
get gifts he's really really good at
gift-giving and these are so neat I love
it so cute my friend Gaby got me the
cutest freaking thing in the world this
is a star map of the night I was born
Gaby rolled like a cute little quote
here that says you were born to light up
the world she's with you and it says the
night sky on the day I was born January
27th 1992 this is the star map of the
night which I think is so pretty such a
thoughtful gift and so sweet this is
gonna look so nice in my be room I've
been saying this for about I don't know
nine months but I'm switching things up
in my reading room and I'm changing up
the decor and stuff and this is gonna
look so nice on my wall I'm so in love
with this I think it's so great think
you got me so much if you're watching
this and I know that you can look at
this and be like uh how do you know with
the stuff what the stars looked like and
that you were born but I googled and I
kinda like did my research on what they
use and how they do this if you're
interested I think it's like the night
sky calm or something like that but I
love this it's so my friend got me this
really cute umbrella it's one of those
small like compact umbrellas that you
can travel with and it's of my favorite
painting I don't know if you guys know
this but a starry night is my favorite
painting ever it's so beautiful and she
got me his son brother
oh sorry night and she told me she got
it on Amazon and I freaking love it I
haven't opened it yet because I'm pretty
sure they say it's bad luck to open an
umbrella in your house is that a crazy
Cuban thing I'm Google it according to
superstition bad luck will rain on you
if you open an umbrella indoors when
explanation comes from the days when
umbrellas were used as protection from
the Sun
opening one inside was an insult to the
sun-god
houki this is what it looks like I ain't
trying to upset no some god we're not
opening that but I mean you guys know
what starry night looks like right
that's what it looks like when the
umbrella opens but hey guys these were
the things I got for Christmas all of
these I loved so much I just want to
thank my friends and my family for even
getting me gifts when they really didn't
need to
they're so thoughtful and kind and they
just represent me so well and I don't
