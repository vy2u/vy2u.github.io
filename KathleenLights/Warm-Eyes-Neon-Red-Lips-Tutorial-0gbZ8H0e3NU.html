a makeup tutorial on the makeup I'm
wearing right now it is a very warm look
and I know that I do warm looks all the
time on my channel they're my favorite
looks to do especially in the summertime
I love really warm bronzy looks but this
look is a little bit different because I
paired it with a bold lip and usually I
pair my smokey eyes with nude lips you
can definitely do this look and then
pair it with a nude lip if you're more
comfortable with that I know this is a
little bit loud for some people I wanted
to do something different in terms of my
lips usually my tutorials always end up
with nude lips so I wanted to change it
up a slip I think it's so summery
because it's a red neon lip but it has a
little bit of an orange undertone and
it's so pretty I love it
for those of you who are sick of all my
warm tutorials don't worry I'm planning
on doing a lot of tutorials with the
lorac Pro palette 2 a little bit more
cool toned looks so yeah I really hope
you guys like this look and if you want
to see how to get this look then just
keep watching so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to prime my
eyelids I am using my la girl pro
conceal primer no concealer nut primer
I'm using this to prime my eyes because
it is a full coverage product and it's
just going to cover up all the redness
and veins on my lids now I'm going to
take my makeup eat I shadow in the shade
Peach Smoothie and on a morphe fluffy
brush I'm just going to buff this into
my crease and just pretty much put it
everywhere because it's gonna be my
transition shade and it's gonna give it
a beautiful peach look now I'm going to
take makeup
eeks creme brulee and on a smaller
blending brush I'm going to be doing the
exact same thing only I'm not going to
be too messy with it I'm going to be a
little bit more precise and adding this
directly in my crease and on the outer
half of my eye
now I'm just going to take a warm orange
shade this is just an orange eye shadow
in my naturally pretty palette from it
cosmetics and on my Mac 217 I'm going to
be very very precise with this color a
little bit more precise incredible a and
I'm going to be putting this pretty much
in just like the hollow of my crease and
on the outer V of my eye as well
next I'm going to take my tart Park
Avenue princess bronzer this and stab
myself in the eye this is the shimmery
one and I'm just going to pack this on
my entire lid honestly any shimmery
bronzer will do you can even skip this
step I just wanted to add a little bit
more dimension to the center of the lid
since most of the colors were in the
crease and the outer V of the eye but
you don't have to do this step now I'm
going to take a mocha by makeup geek and
it is a beautiful dark brown color I
love this eye shadow and on a flat
shader brush I'm just going to be
applying this really really close to my
top lashes to kind of make like a very
subtle eyeliner look I want it to look
deeper and like chocolatier
towards the eye lashes and make it blown
out towards the crease if that makes any
sense
really quickly I'm going to move on to
the rest of my face before I finish my
eyes I'm going to use my Tarte primed
and poreless primer and I'm going to put
this all over my face well on the areas
where I want to cover up my pores or to
hide them or blur them or whatever now
I'm using my Revlon Colorstay foundation
in two 5240 fresh beige I don't I don't
exactly remember I will put it in the
description box and this foundation is
darker than my face but it matches the
rest of my body so I am self-tanning at
the moment so that's why my face is a
little bit lighter and the rest of my
body I'm going to use my booboo cover-up
concealer and I'm going to use this to
cover up my dark circles and to
highlight my face as well
I'm just blending that out with my Real
Techniques contour brush
now I'm going to use max emphasize
powder and on my ELF tapered brush I'm
just going to pack that underneath my
lashes to set my concealer underneath my
lashes no no no underneath my eyes to
set my under eye concealer and set the
rest of my concealer as well moving back
to the eyes I'm just going to take a
mocha again and do the exact same thing
I did earlier only making it a little
bit darker this time and then I'm going
to sweep my brush back and forth just to
blend it out and it can look kind of
like a sunset there were ghosts darker
to lighter
now I'm going to be using my Milani
shadow eyes and I'm going to use this to
run it on the waterline and then I'm
going to go in with Mac's no makeup geek
is wrong with me today makeup geeks
creme brulee and I am just going to
apply this underneath my lashes and
really really blow it out I'm going to
smoke it out I want it to look very very
smoky on the lower lash line then I'm
going to take mocha again and I'm going
to set that cream product I put in my
waterline now I have been putting
eyeshadow in my waterline for years and
years and years and years and it's never
irritated my eye I don't have sensitive
eyes but if you have sensitive eyes and
don't do this but I'm just going to set
that so it kind of makes like a nice
Brown eyeliner and the powder is just
going to make it set and stay all day
now I'm going to go in with this Milani
eyeshadow in the shade below chiffon and
I'm going to apply this underneath my
brow bone it is the most beautiful color
it has like a gold undertone and I'm
going to put this in my inner tear-duct
as well I'm applying some mascara to my
bottom lashes and I'm getting them
really really good because I want them
to be very very like voluminous on my
bottom lashes and I am using my
Elizabeth mock it's so big mascara and
then I'm going to apply some to the top
lashes as well because I will be going
in with some falsies I am using my red
cherry 7 4 7 M and then I am going to
apply them to my lashes so finishing off
with my face I am using my NARS Laguna
bronzer on my ELF complexion brush and
I'm just going to be warming up my face
I'm not adding blush so I want my face
to be very very warm and bronzy but I'm
really focusing this bronzer on my
cheekbones I want it to be like very
intense on my cheeks as you can see not
like very intense but I want them to
stand out my cheekbones so I'm applying
a lot of the bronzer there
now I'm going to add my highlight and
I'm using my Sigma contour brush to add
it and I'm taking my Bella chiffon
eyeshadow again and I'm going to use
this as a base highlight this is so
amazing to highlight your cheekbones
because of that gold undertone oh my god
it's just so beautiful and like goddess
like in summary I love it so much it's
like my new favorite base highlighter
now it's so beautiful so that is what
I'm doing and I'm going to take it on
the bridge of my nose and on my upper
lip and you know all the beautiful
places your highness so for my lips the
coolest part of this tutorial I am
taking my Milani anti feathering lip
pencil thing and I'm going to put that
on my lips and then I'm going to add
some concealer to my lips so that the
lip color will look more true to its
color because my lips are very pigmented
so the color that's on my lips is the
Lime Crime Velveteen in suede berry this
stuff is no joke it's a beautiful hot
neon orange --red it comes off more neon
in person like a lot more neon in person
it's just absolutely beautiful and it
lasts all day on the lips I seriously
had to get like makeup remover to take
this off of my lips because it's like
cement on your face it's great if you
want something that will last all day so
that is the finished look guys I really
hope you enjoyed this video thank you
