a first impression it's kind of like a
wear test I know a ton of people have
already done this video but it was
really requested I'm gonna be trying out
the new Urban Decay all nighter
waterproof long wear liquid foundation
I'm going to apply this to my face for
the first time I've never tried it and
then I'm gonna wear it throughout the
day and I'll check back in later on it
night after a significant amount of
hours and I'll tell you guys if it did
last all night or not I definitely
should have started this video earlier
it is 3:30
it's like nighttime I'm sorry even
though it's 3:30 I'm gonna wear it for
about 8 hours because I feel like that
is somebody's typical day or even if
it's an all nighter foundation if you're
going out at night and partying all
night I would say eight hours is a good
time to test a foundation to see if it
lasts okay so I was actually gonna try
out this primer for the first time today
because I just got a Kat Von D PR
package but I don't want this to alter
how I feel about the foundation so I'm
going to use a primer that I know I
already love and works for me but this
Kat Von D lock-it
hydrating primer base is calling my name
I cannot wait to try this I tried on the
back of my hand and it feels amazing I'm
gonna go in with my glossy a priming
moisturizer this does not affect the
longevity of my makeup which is why I'm
using it today it's just a hydrator like
I have certain primers that keep my
makeup on longer but I want to make sure
that this foundation stays on my face
because it's supposed to not because of
the primer and I need to put on
something moisturizing underneath my
foundation anyway because well you
already know why okay so now I'm going
to go in with the Urban Decay all
nighter foundation if you don't know how
the numbering works everything that's
point zero point zero anything that ends
with a zero is a warm tone color and
anything that ends in point five is pink
toned but now they came out with this
shade that's 3.25 which is a neutral
undertone which I'm so excited that
they're doing I wish they would extend
that to every number like 4.25 5.25 I
don't think they do that which they
totally should because not everybody is
yellow and not everybody is pink some
people are a little bit of both like me
I have a neutral to warm undertone
sometimes on
look like mustard on my face so Urban
Decay actually sent me three shades and
when they sent me the three shades
two of them were point five so they were
way too pink for me I didn't notice this
color before in the PR package I thought
all three of them were pink tones so I
went out and bought the shade 3.0
because I am this specific shade in The
Naked Skin Foundation I think I'm
actually gonna try the 3.25 this does
oxidize I have swatch this on the back
of my hand and like within five minutes
it's like two shades darker so I'm a
little bit worried about that I don't
know how it's going to look on my skin I
haven't tried it on my face I'm gonna do
one pump it looks a little pink maybe I
should just do like a little pump of the
3.0 and then I'm gonna mix it I prefer
putting on foundation with a Beauty
Blender but I've heard a lot of people
say that they like how this foundation
applies with a brush I don't want to put
too much because I hear that this has a
lot of coverage so I'm gonna do this
side with my Beauty Blender actually
this isn't a Beauty Blender a lot of you
guys recommended that I should try the
sponge from Amazon I completely forgot
the name of it uh yeah completely forgot
the name of it but well this has a lot
of coverage whoa gonna do that we're
just gonna do my nose - might as well so
yeah I forgot the name of I think it's
beauty junkies no no no no I I don't
remember the name of the sponge but I
got it on Amazon and it's actually
pretty good
very reminiscent to the Beauty Blender
and doesn't suck up a lot of product it
doesn't look cakey on my face but it
looks cakey around my nose and I kind of
saw that coming because anything that
says full coverage whenever it touches
my nose it looks so cakey but I will
zoom in and I will do all that in a
second you see like it's looking already
darker on the back of my hand
so the finish with a sponge is really
really pretty and it doesn't look heavy
or anything it looks very very natural
so now I'm going to try it this
with a brush I have a feeling I'm going
to prefer the Beautyblender
you definitely only need one pump I did
a pump and a half just some mixed colors
but there's still so much product on the
back of my hand a little goes a very
long way with this I look crazy right
now
okay so immediately I eat 100% prefer
the side with the Beautyblender it looks
less cakey applying it with a brush I
don't like it at all with a brush it
looks way too heavy so I'm just going to
go over it with my sponge okay so this
is what the foundation looks like on my
skin I think the color match is good it
does oxidize at first when you're
blending it out it is lighter but it
does set a little bit darker it feels
like I have nothing on my face like when
I touch my face it does not feel tacky
whatsoever I have felt foundations that
feel even powdery err so it's not like a
super matte finish at least I don't
think so like it doesn't feel too dry
now I'm gonna bring you in closer just
so that you can see what it looks like
a little bit close so this is what it
looks like up close excuse my little
stash here it didn't really sink into my
pores that much I didn't even use a pore
minimizing primer it looks a little bit
heavy around my nose that is my biggest
pet peeve when it comes to foundations
sometimes if they're too full coverage
or too heavy it will look cakey around
my nose and in between my eyebrows but
it doesn't look bad in between my
eyebrows like at all so that one my skin
more up close it definitely looks
flawless I will say this isn't a
foundation that you look at someone's
skin like em are they wearing foundation
or are they not no I mean you could tell
wearing foundation it's a full coverage
foundation that it's to be expected and
I also have a really big problem with
foundations creasing right here in my
smile lines happens all the time
and this one is already creating kind of
like a little dent right here but it's
okay it happens to me all the time but
anyway now I'm gonna finish the rest of
my face make and then I will be right
back
okay so I just finished the rest of my
face makeup I kind of sped it up and
showed you guys what I used more or less
but yeah it's looking really good I
really like how my bronzer blended like
I like how everything applied on top
there was no patchiness or no
streakiness to this I didn't set my
entire face with powder because I didn't
feel the need to so I just set the areas
that I applied my concealer and it just
everything blended awesome like I'm
really liking this foundation so far the
only downside is the cakiness
around my nose oh let me do a flash test
almost forgot that that is the weirdest
smile I don't even know what I'm doing
there but yeah with flash it looks
really good maybe just slightly lighter
than the rest of my body because I think
my foundation is just slightly lighter
than the rest of my body but there's no
white cast with this foundation sewn on
it's not looking good oh yeah now I will
wear this all day and I will update you
guys at the end of the day how
everything turned out hello there it is
really frequently it's 12:53 a.m. pretty
much 1:00 in the morning and the only
reason I'm doing this update so late is
because I just finished watching the
Marlin game a
in San Francisco it ended up having like
a billion innings and now is when the
game finished at what I am but I've had
this foundation on for about nine hours
now which is a pretty good time my
bronzer is still on my blush is still on
my highlight still on and usually those
things are the first to go so I'm really
really impressed it's lost a little bit
of coverage throughout the hours like I
can see my vein but for the most part
the foundation is still on besides my
nose like the foundation has completely
rubbed off on my nose I was women in a
second but that's to be expected because
saline really likes to lick my nose it's
settled into my smile lines a little bit
throughout the day but nothing like
dramatic I'm actually pretty freaking
impressed that this is what my skin
looks like after nine hours and yeah I
mean you guys know I have dry skin
obviously I don't really get oily
throughout the day so keep that in mind
I have to say that I like this more than
I thought I was going to because I was
hearing so many people with oily skin
rave about this so I thought it would be
too drying or too cakey for me but it's
not only around my nose but I can make
it work I could do things to make it
work really really loving how it looks
after a full day and it took a fat nap
also I forgot to mention that maybe
that's why I kind of rubbed off a little
bit here let me zoom you in okay so in
the viewfinder my nose doesn't look that
bad in person it actually looks worse
but it looks pretty good
I gotta say I totally approve I was even
laying down on a blanket and it didn't
really transfer to my blanket like I
didn't notice foundation on my blanket
this definitely isn't a foundation I
would wear a day to day I like something
more doing more lightweight and not as
full coverage but when it comes to full
coverage foundations I don't like many
but this one I'm liking I give this a
thumbs up but yeah that completes this
video I hope you enjoyed it and that it
was helpful thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
