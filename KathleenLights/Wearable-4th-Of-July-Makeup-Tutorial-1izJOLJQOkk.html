inspired makeup tutorial anything it's
perfect for those people who are afraid
of wearing like blue and red eye shadow
it's a nice way to still incorporate red
white and blue in your makeup but it's
still very wearable at the same time
okay so first I'm taking this Maybelline
Color tattoo in the color barely branded
it's just this very light champagne
color and I am just going to be putting
this all over my lid but not passing the
crease
next I'm taking my milk jumbo eye pencil
and I'm going to be putting this
underneath my brow bone and in my tear
duct area to really brighten it up and
it's kind of my base for the eye shadow
I'm going to be putting there
so I'm going to put a lot of it and then
I'm gonna blend it out
now I'm taking my Cielo in the light
palette and I'm taking this color called
kitten it's like steel as most famous
eyeshadow and it's pretty much the same
color as the base I put down on my
eyelid so that's what I'm going to be
using I'm going to take this I'm going
to put it all over my lid
I'm not going to pass the crease I don't
want it too shimmery in my crease so I'm
just focusing it on the lid and I'm
going to use this as my tear duct
highlight because I want it to be very
very bright in that area the milk eyes
shadow base really helps brighten up
that inner tear-duct
now I'm taking this brown color called
cork any like mid-tone brown color will
work I'm going to use this on my Mac 217
brush and I'm going to work this into my
crease
I'm going to keep this directly in my
crease I'm not going to take it too far
up or too far down but I am going to put
some in the outer corner just to warm up
the outer corners of my eye a little bit
okay so next I'm going to take a white
matte eyeshadow this is just a white
eyeshadow that's in this NYX love in
Paris palette so yeah any white matte
eyeshadow will work and I'm going to use
this as my brow bone highlight
this is just a big fluffy blur brush
from Coastal Scents
so right here I am just lining my
waterline with that same milk jumbo eye
pencil okay so next I'm taking this
matte blue eyeshadow from Mac it's
broken and disgusting I know and I'm so
sorry I do not know what the name of
this eyeshadow is but I am just going to
put this on my waterline right here I'm
fast-forwarding it because I'm just
going back and forth dipping my brush
into that color and putting it on my
waterline and I'm sorry I'm like not
even that much in the frame it's really
hard to film at this angle I don't know
but basically I just line the waterline
with that blue eye shadow I put it over
the white base I put in my waterline and
now I'm just taking a pencil brush and
dipping it into that same blue color and
I'm just going to smoke it out a little
bit just so it doesn't look like just a
straight harsh blue line I'm just
blending it out a little bit okay so now
I'm just taking my master precise liquid
liner and I'm just gonna just do a nice
long wing I tried to record this but of
course it was a disaster I just I
couldn't film myself I was out of focus
it was it's boots really hard to film
yourself putting on eyeliner but yeah
basically I just winked it out a pretty
long wing not too thick not too skinny
and I also put on some mascara I use the
Maybelline illegal inks on my bottom
lashes and Clinique lash doubling on my
top lashes so here I'm just taking my
cherry lipliner from Mac and I'm gonna
line my lips with it because of course
we're going to be putting on some red
lipstick because what is the fourth of
July without red lipstick and of course
the iconic
Ruby whoo that is the lipstick I am
wearing and so I'm just going to fill in
the rest of my lips with the Ruby woo
lipstick and that's pretty much it I
already have the rest of my face makeup
on just to save some time
but I hope you enjoyed this look thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
