is also pretty Lisa's daughter which
means she is also Porter's sister single
owner see if you guys didn't know some
of you already know story but my dad has
a Yorkie named TB and you guys know my
review Cornelius well one day when Danny
was on deployment I didn't know TB was
in heat or that she had her period or
you know and I found quitting this stop
with TB you know I'm saying you get the
gist of it Porter is Cornelius's son if
you guys didn't know it was so horrible
we did not want that to happen my dad
was freaking out I was freaking out it
was horrific but I just had to keep
Porter and then my mom kept Darcy and
she's this sweet little pumpkin look at
her oh look at this sweet little pumpkin
my mom is spending the night because
Danny and I are gonna be driving up a
couple hours to my friend's house all my
friends Stephanie in your manual yeah
Stephanie is one of my closest friends
and they have a house in Jensen Beach
which is like a few hours away from
where I live and they have an apartment
there today is actually Saturday and
we're gonna head out and spend the night
and then spend all day tomorrow there so
we're gonna spend our whole day Sunday
and then come back Sunday night but I'm
really excited because I haven't meaning
a little to hang out with Stephanie
since she had her baby it's not me
excited to see Stephanie we're going
with Danny's dad and I need stepmom
because I think the guys want to go
fishing or something like that I'll
probably just get in the pool with
Stephanie we shall we shall see I'm just
gonna go ahead and get ready for that
because we're leaving like in 30 minutes
I'm just taking this little bag here
this one is Stephanie by the way there's
my friend Stephanie if anywhere you
cared you got this little bag at
Nordstrom it was like 20 dollars and I'm
just gonna pack on my makeup in here
honestly I'm not gonna be wearing makeup
I'm coming back tomorrow night but just
in case we go to lunch or dinner or
whatever I'm just gonna throw some stuff
in there
okay I guess bag packed I just have my
bathing suit in there and like a pair of
jeans and sandals and stuff by the way
they've just got these shoes and I'm in
love with them they're so comfortable
they're the adidas shoes like with
Pharrell with of Pharrell shoes and I
love them they're so colorful and fun
and they are super comfortable love them
I wanted to stay for more days but I had
so much pre recording to do that I
couldn't but I couldn't not go because I
haven't seen Stephanie so I feel so bad
well you know gotta make it work somehow
good morning guys right and literally
cannot see we're just down here last
night and I woke up I just woke up and
I'm actually wearing makeup which is so
bad you should never fall asleep with
your makeup just aged myself like ten
years but we got in last night and I was
so sleepy I just knocked out and they
just look up and I'm the only one that's
awake in the house Stephanie's asleep
and Manuel's sleep Danny's sleep is that
everybody's asleep I'm always the first
one to wake up every time I'm outside of
my element and I'm outside of my house I
wake up really really early it's so
relaxing here it's not necessarily like
the most beautiful beaches like Miami
Beach but there's barely any people here
there's like four people on the beach
somebody's trying to learn how to surf
and then there's like a couple walking
on the beach it's a very private like
secluded area which I really really like
but honestly just through this noise
like the sound of the waves and the
birds so you really cannot be the sounds
of nature you cannot nothing sounds as
pretty as ocean waves and like wind
birds I live for it
doing I mean there's like a group of
people over there so I'm going to
learning how to serve but everything is
just so empty and quiet not to have a
party okay anyway we're just gonna be
here for the rest of the day hang out
play dominoes play some cards walk on
the beach and then go home tonight
because tomorrow is Monday and they show
must go on
oh my god this done ah everybody woke up
already I was the first one to wake up
like no no blogging Emma's looking at
you like what vlogging
so when we were in we didn't realize it
was cool on the car seat and you might
have sat on top of a poop but now we got
to figure that out now we got a poopy
car seat and I'll put the baby booboo
car scene
come on I mean this is yes
there's the poop ladies and gentlemen
this is a mother's job she can doesn't
matter her mouth is white her nose is
not a look at this her nose is I might
kiss this is my favorite time of day
it's super glooming here unfortunately
we couldn't go to the beach because it's
been raining all day but it's a nice
green
alright guys about to head back home
after I eat some dinner with the crew
see ya later in a little oh my god so
many public kisses for me why oh I had
so much fun I hadn't seen Stephanie and
what felt like an eternity
Emma's actually 2 months old she'll be 3
months at the end of this month and it
was actually the first time I had ever
held a baby that's two months old I'm
not even lying I have five nieces and
nephews I'm about to have six nieces and
nephews and I never held them before six
months old like I have this rule that I
can only hold a baby once it is 6 months
old I just I'm so scared to hold babies
I'm kind of surprised myself that I held
Emma I mean it didn't go low in the
beginning but you know I had fun it was
cool I think I'm just gonna wrap up this
vlog here Danny left to the Marlins game
right now but I had to stay back because
I had a lot of editing to do a lot of
peer recording I am about to film a
video for the kale polish YouTube

Marlins game bummer but somewhat to do
