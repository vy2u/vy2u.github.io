tutorial on the look I'm wearing I
recently posted a full face drugstore
tutorial on my channel and what is all
of this all over the place and in the
comment section somebody commented
saying if for my next full face
drugstore tutorial I would do a tutorial
using the comfort zone palette from Wet
n Wild and that is what I'm doing today
I was like good idea subscriber good
idea
FATA for a little bit and I've never
done a tutorial using it so I decided to
do it and most of the time I'm not gonna
lie I use these colors right here you
guys know if you watch my channel that I
hate okay well that's a strong word I'm
sorry let me take that back I don't like
green eyeshadow on my eyes I know you
guys say that you like it on my eyes but
I don't I don't think it's flattering on
my eyes because my eyes are green so
there's no contrast so it doesn't really
like make my eyes pop it all like blends
together that's just how I feel but
since I always use colors like this I
decided to use this side for today's
tutorial because I know a lot of you
guys love green eyeshadows so that's
what I did today if you guys want to see
you toriel using these colors right here
then let me know in the comments of
course could be some it's my camera
crooked gonna be something that I
typically do like a very bronzy eye with
this brown but I love this chocolaty
color nor am I going with this
I also used a couple other wet and wild
eye shadow I don't know why one wild has
no
do Who I am this is a sponsor Greg on a
wild I just love wet and wild eyeshadows
so sheep so glue a pencil right here and
I decided not to cover it with concealer
just because no this isn't Heineken it's
sparkling water idealistic on me I want
to address something a lot of people say
like whenever I do something like stone
in my videos that I'm sounding like
Manny that I'm starting to talk like
Manny no I'm not copping Manny when I
talk like that I'm imitating Miranda
sings every time I talk like that I have
like binge watched Miranda sings
recently like for the past three months
that's all I do is watch Miranda sings
and she talks like that if you don't
know who Miranda sings is she's a
youtuber she's out of her mind
I love her so Miranda sings talks just
like that and Manny loves Miranda sings
too and so do i so we're like imitating
the same person that's what people think
I'm imitating him I know
Miranda oh crap this is supposed to be a
tutorial and I'm here just talking Wow
well I'm sorry longest intro ever I'll
let you uh go on and now okay we're
going to prime our eyelids that is first
because we want our eye shadows to stay
in place all day and to look more
vibrant so for that I'm using my la
girls
concealer is I like to use it to prime
then I'm going to take this palette from
what wild it's super old and
discontinued and it makes me sad because
it's probably the best palette what a
wild ever came out with it's the vanity
palette if you could snag this on
amazon.com or eBay get your hands on it
is amazing I'm using that Brown and I'm
going to use it as my transition strip
what
transition shade because the comfort
zone palette is nothing but shimmers so
yes going into the comfort zone palette
I'm going to take this really dark dark
green it has a bunch of green little
glitters in it but it's just a really
dark color and I'm going to be applying
this to my entire lid all the way up to
my crease just not passing the crease
just getting right up in there yeah
then I'm going to take this really
beautiful goalie green color and I'm
going to apply this to my entire lid
this is a brush from ELF it's in their
$1.00 line it's just a flat shader brush
so I'm applying this color to my entire
lid and then I'm wetting the brush up it
and then going over it just so that the
color can be a little bit more intense
when you wet it then I'm going to go
back into that brown shade and I'm gonna
blend out any harsh lines then I'm going
to take this brush it's from morphe and
I'm going to start building this color I
dipped it into that dark green shade
again and I'm going to start packing
this color onto my outer V and then
dragging it into the crease and then
connecting it to the other side of my
eye in the inner corner if that makes
sense I want the light goldish green
color to be only in the center of the
lid to draw attention to the center of
the lid does that make sense of packing
the darkness on the outer V and on the
inner part of my eye as well well you
see what I'm doing you get the gist of
it so I'm going to go back and forth
with that it is a lot of building
because you want to start off slow
instead of just packing on like black
eyeshadow and the inner part and stuff
like that so after I've done that I'm
going to take a pencil brush and this
cream color in the abandoning palette
and of course I'm like out of focus and
out of frame but I'm going to highlight
my brow bone with this color then I'm
going to take the brow bone trained in
this palette and I'm going to go over it
yes I'm also going to do that whole
process to the inner part of my eye as
well my inner tear duct area Thailand so
I'm going to finish off well I'm going
to start my face makeup before I finish
my eye makeup and I'm just priming my
face with the pore eraser by Maybelline
and then I'm going to use my L'Oreal
True Match
and I am my foundation is done I know
that was random but it's time to skip my
foundation so that the video isn't too
long but I use the True Match Lumi to
give myself a little bit of a glow
factor I'm using my Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 15 fair and I'm a
highlight about whole face as you can
see my under eyes and just my face I'm
blending that in with a morphe brush and
after I blended all of that in I'm going
to take are you surprised
my Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35 and
I'm going to set that concealer with it
setting under-eye concealer is really
important so that the concealer doesn't
crease and settle into your lines I'm
going to go back into this palette I'm
going to take this cranberry shade this
isn't going to make much of a difference
I actually don't know why I use this
color yeah but I did it on the other eye
so I decided to just do it on this side
as well but after I did that I'm taking
some of the brown and I'm kind of
diffusing that cranberry shade just
blending it out and then I'm gonna go
yeah I put on some but this video is a
hot mess isn't it I filmed this like at
3 in the morning so I put on some
eyeliner I use my Maybelline master
drama eyeliner and then I dipped my
brush right back into that dark green
shade and I'm applying it really close
to my lashline that's why I'm using this
brush is a really flat kind of like
precise brush it's from Eagle tools it's
amazing so after I apply some of that
dark green eye shadow I'm going to take
the light green eye shadow and just
apply it in the very center kind of to
mimic the lid on top I'm going to apply
some mascara this is the Jordana best
lash extreme this would
amazing with falsies but it was three in
the morning and I'm just good at guys I
could gonna deal with it so I just
applied some mascara I'm fast-forwarding
this part because basically I'm just
using my ELF mineralized bronzer in the
shade tan toffee it's kind of a warm
bronzer so I'm just warming up my skin
I'm not really contouring or anything
just adding some warm then I'm going to
take this blush this is rose de Oro from
Milani and I'm applying this to my
cheeks this is a beautiful like bronze e
coral color I don't know it looks really
good with green eyeshadow love it try it
with green eyeshadow it's beautiful so
I'm applying that to my sheikhs and then
I'm going to take this eyeshadow from
Milani it's called Bella chiffon and I'm
actually going to use this as a
highlight for my cheekbones it has a
beautiful golden undertone I swear it's
like a beautiful full highlight I highly
recommend Bella chiffon as a highlight
you will not be disappointed if you like
golden kind of highlights and I decided
to just add that same fellowship on
eyeshadow to my brow bone and my inner
tear-duct as well if you don't have this
eyeshadow you don't have to do this but
I really like intense highlights then
Porter decided he didn't want to be able
to floor any wall more as oh yeah I'm
going to line my lips a little bit using
the Jordana lip liner in tawny I'm only
going to add just a little bit of this
to my lips just add like a flush of this
color not too much but I am filling my
whole lip with this just very lightly
then I'm going to go into this
Maybelline creamy matte lipstick in
daringly new
it's a really pretty pinky nude okay so
that completes this video thank you so
