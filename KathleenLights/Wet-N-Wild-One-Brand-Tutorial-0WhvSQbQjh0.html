tutorial featuring wet-and-wild I told
you guys recently that I wanted to get
back into these one brand tutorials and
today we're using one in wild it was
only once I completed this look that I
realized I actually have a look
ridiculously similar to this already on
my channel that I did not that long ago
so I'm so sorry this looks very similar
to a previous look but it is a full
phase what a wild look so I decided to
just just post it anyway because I
really love how my face makeup turned
out and I just like how romantic the
look is and since all of these products
are ridiculously affordable I thought
maybe it was worth a watch the one thing
I will say is I love wet and wild as a
brand I think they're probably one of
the best drugstore brands not only in
terms of quality but in terms of price
but I so struggled with my eye makeup
and I will go into details in the video
but I use a combination of the wet and
wild single eyeshadows the comfort zone
palette which is probably the best one
in wild palette ever and I also used
this palette this is a new one and wild
palette called
unnatural and this is the rosy toned one
it has a lot of reds and pinks and I do
not like this palette at all I just used
two of the shadows but I just didn't
like them this copper one is the one I
used on my entire lid and I just
pictured it completely different I have
to wet it and even after wetting it it
wasn't enough it kinda was coming it's
coming off right now I don't know if you
can see it there but it was like coming
off in patches which probably means this
eye makeup won't last that long but I
still want you guys to see the whole the
whole process anyway I wanted to do
something very very simple because maybe
you're watching this video because you
just started out in makeup
in wild is the brand you're looking at
first so this I make up is extremely
easy I just honestly would not recommend
these pallets I would go strictly for
the comfort zone or any other wet and
wild palate like this the only thing on
my face that is in wet and wild is my
mascara because I cannot find my mascara
anywhere I purposely bought one for this
tutorial I bought the mega length
mascara it's in a purple tube no idea
where it is can't find it anywhere
but besides that everything on my face
is wet and wild and I am in love with
the face makeup like every face product
I use today I love so much I think
that's definitely where the money's at
is face makeup when it comes to what a
wild and ridiculously cheap way cheaper
than other brands at the drugstore so
yeah don't forget to leave me a comment
down below what you want my next one
brand tutorial to me and I will look
into it
so if you want to see how to get this
romantic glowy look just keep watching
okay so I'm actually going to start off
this tutorial with my brows I'm using
the wet and wild color icon brow shaper
this is just like a clear wax use that
to brush my hairs and then I went in
with this little ultimate brow kit in
the shade ash Brown probably not my
perfect shade but I'm using the lightest
powder in the kit and I'm just running
this through my brows and just kind of
shaping them the way I want them to it's
kind of hard to do it with powder alone
I usually like using a brow pencil and
then a powder on top not just a powder
by itself but I don't think it turned
out horribly for being like a weird
shade yeah so I actually put the Wet n
Wild ultimate brow mascara on top this
is in the shade nothing but brunette I
love this brow mascara it's really good
and then I moved on to Zee face this is
the wet and wild color icon face primer
this is a good primer it just kind of
smooths out your skin and it gives you a
nice base for foundation and then I went
in with the cover off that I say color
icon primer I meant cover off primer and
then I went in with the wet and wild
cover off foundation this one is in the
shade fair slash light and I'm just
applying that on my entire face using a
real techniques sponge I broke out on my
forehead after I did a photo shoot
recently like broke out
pretty badly on my forehead don't know
what caused it either so strange I'm
going to take the come correct concealer
very similar to the cosmetics bye-bye
under-eye it's very very thick so I'm
blending it in a little bit with my
finger and then to kind of make it a
little bit liquid Here I am mixing it in
with this wet and wild highlighting pen
in the shade ivory into you this is just
gonna make it easier to blend so I'm
highlighting with this as well all over
the face like a savage around my mouth
it takes a while to blend this under-eye
concealer out but you know doing my best
with the sponge I'm going to set that
concealer using the wet and wild contour
little duo kit thing this is in the
shade Bootsy the licha and I took the
light shade in the duo and I use this to
set my under eye concealer and anywhere
else I placed the concealer okay so now
let's move on to the eyes I'm going to
use this new one in wild primer this is
the photo focus eye primer and this is
not for those of you who have really dry
eyelids because it can dry out the lids
just a little bit I recommend patting it
in but it does make your eyeshadow last
all day I took the wet and wild single
eyeshadow in creme brulee and just set
that primer down and I went into this
all natural palette this is the pinky
toned one and I took that shade I
pointed at and I'm using this kind of as
a transition shade and then I wanted
something a little bit more Brown in the
crease
so it took the comfort zone palette and
I took this shade labeled crease on the
left side and I'm using the same brush
just kind of like a nice blending crease
brush and I am buffing this into my
crease as well
I'm going to take this Wet n Wild photo
focus setting spray and I'm going to wet
this one dollar elf brush and I'm going
to dip it into that copper shade in that
palette and I do not like this I shadow
I definitely had to wet it because when
I tried to use it dry on the other eye
zero pigmentation was coming off on the
brush like zero it's not the best eye
shadow it kind of splotches off but
anyway I took a fluffy crease brush and
just buffed out the edges and then to
highlight underneath my brow bone
I took the single shadow in sugar for my
waterline I'm using the wet and wild
megalast retractable eyeliner in
blackest black really good eyeliner but
I poked myself in the eye by mistake and
my eyes were a little bit of red for a
second there which calls the black to
smudge just a little bit because my eyes
were so watery I took that copper shade
I used on the lid and buffed that on my
lower lash line and then I took the
crease shade I used earlier and did the
same thing I wanted a little bit more
depth on the outer corner so I took the
shade called definer and just focus this
on the outer corners of my eyes and then
I went in with this wet and wild
I need a subsequent a while this is all
wet and wild okay I use the mega liner
in the shade dark brown and then I
highlighted my inner corners with the
brow bone shade from the comfort zone
palette but I didn't record it like it
did not record I'm still trying to get
used to this new camera but I'm going to
contour my cheeks I'm going to use that
contour duo in the shade dulce de leche
and obviously using the contour shade
and I'm just chiseling my cheekbones a
little and then I wanted to warm up the
skin this is the color icon bronzer in
the shade ticket to Brazil yes it's a
nice light color but it gives your face
a little bit of warmth really really
pretty I love love love this bronzer so
much it even has SPF I love it it's
great for blush I'm using the color icon
blush in the shade rose champagne
another favorite of mine it gives you
such a pretty like natural rosy flush to
the cheeks these blushes last a long
time on the skin as well LUT then I took
the highlighting powder in the shade
precious petals and I am highlighting
the tops of my cheekbones with the Real
Techniques setting brush
and I'm also highlighting my nose with
this powder
well for my lips I just took the
megalast lipstick in the shade bear it
all one of the best lipsticks ever if
you want a nice nude and I thought that
my face looked a little bit too matte so
I went in with the photo focus setting
spray but I just like drenched my skin
like I super drenched but yes that gave
me a nice little glow that completes
