be a little random just because it's
about a product that has been out for
forever so it's a little weird that I'm
doing a review on it now but I really
wanted to dedicate a whole video on the
Wet n Wild mega last lipsticks simply
because I have gotten quite a few
recently and it's like every time I buy
a new one I just fall more and more in
love with these lipsticks so I wanted to
give you my thoughts on them and the
pros and cons and yes I am aware that
these lipsticks have been out for
forever and it is probably a pointless
review but I really wanted to do it just
because you never know maybe someone is
looking into buy a new megalast lipstick
or looking into the wet-and-wild
lipsticks and they want to see someone's
opinions on them and they want to see
lip swatches because of course I'm going
to be adding lip swatches because you
know I'm down like that and I always add
some lip swatches okay so I'm just going
to go ahead and get started with the
review I'm sure you guys have seen these
lipsticks millions of times before but
this is what they look like they just
come in the little black tube and the
cap is clear they have the name of the
lipstick on the bottom on a sticker that
kind of color coordinates which lipstick
it is depending on the color so if
you're going to store it like upside
down you know right away just by looking
at the sticker what color it is so
that's good I'm just really quickly
going to tell you the pros of the
lipstick then I'm going to move on to
the cons and then I'm going to show you
all the ones that I own with actual lip
swatches so pros of this lipstick I
obviously think they're really good
lipsticks I have 14 of them so I mean I
think I like them
but a huge pro is that they are a dollar
ninety-nine which is amazing especially
if you're on a budget these lipsticks
are perfect for you they also don't have
a bad smell I don't know if a lot of
people are picky about that like I am
but I hate the cheap like old lady
lipsticks smell if you know what I'm
talking about
I hate that these smell like absolutely
nothing
like they have no scent whatsoever and I
prefer a lipstick to have a no sense at
all than to have a bad scent so that's a
huge plus for me
another pro is that they come in amazing
colors they come in really intense
bright like bold pinks then they go into
like deeper colors I have really nice
Reds they have really nice plum colors
and then they have their natural peachy
pinks and baiji colors I'll show you in
my lip swatches but they have a really
good color range if you want a more
neutral lip if you want a really bold
lip or if you want something really dark
and like seductive kind of like plummy
or vampire II lip I don't know you get
me I find that the lasting power on
these lipsticks are amazing I mean they
are called the mega last lipsticks so
you know they do what they're supposed
to I get about six hours of wear out of
these before I have to touch up or
anything so lasting power amazing
quickly I want to talk about the cons of
the lipstick when it comes to packaging
you get what you pay for
they are two dollars so of course you're
not going to have any fancy packaging if
you're somebody that's a huge like
packaging junkie that you need to have
like really nice packaging you probably
won't like these lipsticks but there are
$2.00 so I'm okay with the fact that it
has cheap e packaging I don't know if
you can tell but lipstick gets all over
the cap on this guy really annoying you
have to like constantly like cleaner or
just leave it like this if you don't
care okay another con
most of these lipsticks are matte and I
think that's why they are megalast
because matte lipsticks usually last
longer but most of them are if not all
of them are matte so if you're not a
matte lipstick wearer you will not like
these lipsticks I personally love how
matte lipsticks look so I think that's
why I love them so much
but just because they are matte doesn't
mean they're drying um they don't feel
anything like Ruby who does if you know
what Ruby who feels like you know that's
like putting the Sahara on your lips
it's so damn dry they're not
uncomfortable to wear their matte but I
can still rub my lips together there's
still a lot of creaminess to the
lipstick which is a pro even though I'm
talking about the cons so the fact that
most of them are matte isn't necessarily
so bad but I can see how it would be a
con to some people okay so that's
basically it those are the only bad
things I have to say about it it's the
packaging and the formula I would
understand why some people don't like it
but that's pretty much what the only
thing I would say is bad about it
everything else I think is pretty great
about these lipsticks so if you want to
see all the lips all the lipsticks
swatched on my lips and just keep
watching okay so the first one I have is
called bear it all and it is a very
Brown nude this might look a little bit
more pink if you have darker skin but it
comes off pretty brown on my lips and I
actually do like it I think it's the
perfect nude for fall I like it I think
it's nice this one is called think pink
and it is my favorite one right now it's
for everyday it's like the most
beautiful pastel e pink but it doesn't
wash out my lips which is amazing I
don't look sick when I use this like a
lot of pale pink lipsticks look on me
this one's really pretty this one
doesn't have the name on it but it's
called just peachy and it's very similar
to think pink only it's more peachy of
course yeah so it just comes off a
little bit more pinky on my lips than it
does on other people's lips but you can
tell there's a lot more peach to this
one it's just a nice everyday color
this one is called Pinker bail and it is
just a very neon pink the only thing I
can describe it
this next one is called dollhouse pink
it's probably one of my favorites I
definitely top five I started putting my
hand behind the lipstick like you see
here because it was showing it more true
to color in the tube but that's why my
hands there anyway yeah it's just so
neon like I love this color so much it
definitely stands out in person like if
someone's wearing this lipstick you're
like oh okay this next one is called
don't blink pink it's also a hot pink
color but it's really really nice like
it has a lot more of the fuchsia and
Venus instead of like the neon Barbie
pink this one's a little bit more hot
pinkish and it's really pretty this next
one is called smoking hot pink and it's
a nice way to wear like hot pink
lipstick because it's not so
in-your-face it has a lot of red to it
and I think it's really wearable this
next one is called mob out of here and
it's just a really nice purpley mauve
color I also think this would be a
perfect like everyday color in the fall
I think it's really pretty
this one is 24 karat gold and it is a
very orange lipstick like there is no
other way to describe this lipstick it's
orange and it's definitely a summer
color but it is really pretty and I
think that it would look pretty on a lot
of different skin tones this next one I
could barely pronounce
perché persimmon pretty persimmon I
don't know but it is a very red orange
this is probably my favorite color to
ever wear on my lips it just it's so
pretty I don't know I just love this
color so much and it feels really nice
on my lips I love this one this next one
is cherry picking and actually don't
have anything in my lipstick collection
that looks like this it is a pink but it
has some red to it it's like a red
fuchsia pink I don't know how to
describe it it's very rich in person and
it just makes your lips look juicy I
don't know I like it obviously this next
one is stoplight red and oh my goodness
this is like the most beautiful red
lipstick in the world it reminds me of
how Ruby woo like packs a punch only
it's a little bit less drying it's so
creamy and beautiful I love this red
it's like my favorite red lipstick right
now I love it love it love it love it
this one is Sugar Plum Fairy and it is a
purple with like some berry tones
I love how how has like the berry
undertone it's really pretty for fall I
love this one I love all of them I keep
saying that I love this one and I
thought I loved all of them this one can
be a little bit scary I don't have the
sticker on this one either by the way
but it is called Raven raisin and yeah
it's a bit intense I can understand why
people don't like it but I think it's a
nice fall color if I'm feeling daring so
yeah guys that's it I hope you enjoyed
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
