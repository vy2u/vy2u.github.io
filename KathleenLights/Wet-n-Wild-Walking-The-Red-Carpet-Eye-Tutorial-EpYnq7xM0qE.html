tutorial on the eye makeup I'm wearing
right now it is using the wet and wild
walking the red carpet I shot a palette
all the eye shadows on my eyes are from
this palette is just a really neutral
eye but with really thick winged liner
and I just bowled it and I just bowled
it no and I just paired it with a bold
pink lip I'm only gonna be showing you
my eye makeup in this tutorial I'm not
doing like a full face or anything but I
will write in the description box
everything that is on the rest of my
face now I will say that I am super
super unimpressed with this palette like
I thought that I was gonna absolutely
love this and I just don't if you want
to hear my thoughts on this palette then
stay tuned to the end of the video where
I talk a little bit more about it but
I'm gonna go ahead and quickly get onto
the tutorial first I'm using the Urban
Decay primer potion to prime my eyelids
and then I'm gonna go into the wet and
wild palette and I'm gonna take this
color right here it is labeled eyelid
and this is what I'm gonna put on my
entire eye it really isn't the color you
think it's going to be is it then I'm
gonna take this in right here labeled
crease and i'm going to be building this
into my crease and in my outer V as well
it's not as pigmented as I would like it
to be so you really really have to just
build it up and sit there for a while to
build up the color
then I'm going to start dragging it up
and taking it a little bit past my
crease as well
then I'm just gonna take this darker
color right here and I'm going to build
this on to the outer V of my eye using a
flat little shader brush and I'm also
gonna be dragging this into my crease as
well like I said before you just really
have to take your time with it because
it is not as pigmented as I would like
it to be so just sit there and take your
time and get it as dark as you would
like then I'm just gonna take a blending
brush and kind of blend it all together
so there are no harsh lines then I'm
going to go into this eyelid color again
and place them on my eyelid because some
of it did get blended away
I'm also gonna use some of that to
highlight in my inner tear-duct as well
then I'm just gonna line my waterline
and my tightline with Maybelline master
drama in Midnight Master and then I'm
gonna add a really really thick winged
eyeliner just because I felt like the
thin eyeliner was a little bit I wanted
I wanted something a little bit more
dramatic so I added a really thick wing
and then I just added some mascara to my
top lashes I'm gonna take the light pink
color and I'm gonna use this as my brow
bone highlight
then I'm gonna take the color we use in
the crease and I'm gonna run this
underneath my lower lash line just to
smoke it out a little bit and that is
the finished eyes okay so I personally
did like how this look turned out I
actually have worn this look more than
once only I don't do the pink lip or the
super bold eyeliner and it's a little
bit more natural that way but this is
basically the only eye look I do with
this palette looking at this palette you
think oh my god there are so many
different looks you could do so many
different colors and nice swarmy bronzes
and no that's not really the case at all
in order for me to get a really really
pretty eye look with this palette I have
to use other eyeshadows I can't only use
this palette
except when I'm doing this look what I
want to use any of these colors right
here I need to use different eyeshadows
there there is no matte color in this
palette you think that this one right
here would be a really pretty transition
matte color and it comes off like almost
like a like a
topi shimmery color that is the color I
used on my entire lid and it's just not
the color I expected it to be it looks
like a really nice matte brown in the
palette and it's not matte or brown at
all so there are no mattes this one is
just pure glitter like just pure pure
glitter and then the darker ones just
aren't as pigmented and I don't know why
because I've always been extremely
impressed with Wet n Wild and their
palettes what a while to me is like the
best drugstore brand when it comes to
eyeshadows and mmm this was just a dull
dud I was I was just not impressed I
will continue to use it but I'm
definitely gonna be using other
eyeshadows along with it this is not the
kind of how that you would take when
you're traveling because it's just not
enough and honestly I just really was
not impressed so if you've had your eye
on this palette I honestly would say go
ahead and skip it because I don't think
it's worth it even though it's five
dollars okay so that is the end of this
video I just wanted to include a mini
review on this palette because a lot of
people request that a tutorial using it
once I posted the picture on Instagram
and I have played around with this so
much and it just
could not I just couldn't do it so
frustrating so thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
