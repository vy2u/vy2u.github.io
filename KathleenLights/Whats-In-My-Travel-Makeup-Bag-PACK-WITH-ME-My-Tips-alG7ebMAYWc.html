a what's in my travel makeup bag type of
video I've never done this video on my
channel and I like watching these kinds
of videos and it's perfect because I
will be going to Miami today is Thursday
I will be driving down to Miami with
Danny tomorrow night and we will be
there for about two and a half weeks
because he hasn't seen anybody in his
family since he went on deployment so
we're gonna go down and visit some
family I'm also going to be sharing with
you my tips and tricks traveling with
makeup how to travel with less makeup
and things are just more convenient I
don't know if these are like tips and
stuff you probably already know but I'm
just sharing with you what I would do
because I used to be the person who
traveled with like six bronzers six
lipsticks six million things and didn't
end up using half of them and this video
is actually pre-recorded so by the time
that you see this video I would already
be in Miami and I would have been there
for a while already
I'm leaving September 12 so any video
you've seen after September 12 was
pre-recorded or is pre-recorded if you
follow me on Instagram and Twitter you
would have already known that I just
wanted to pre-record so that there
wouldn't be like no videos at all on my
channel for two weeks and I can't have
that actually pre-recorded a lot of
videos so anyway you're going to be
packing with me in this video another
thing that really inspired me to do this
video is that I recently got something
in the mail that I am absolutely crazy
about and it is this guy right here this
is the laura mercier custom artist
portfolio and it is basically like a
makeup bag that looks like a binder I
don't know if this is limited edition or
not but I know that she came out with
one really similar to this last year and
then it went away and then it came back
again with like a different pattern but
this is what it looks like it basically
has like two sections here like two bags
it has this where you could put your
brushes and then you turn it and it has
this where you could put your pallets
and then a bigger bag here and then a
smaller one here and I first saw this in
se buttons video like in her August
favorites or something like that and I
was like mesmerised by this thing and
then I saw the price and I was like oh
why I'm not buying that
but then Danny convinced me to get it I
don't have any travel makeup bag at all
I kind of just throw everything in a
purse
in this large bag that isn't very cute
and he was just I get it because we move
around a lot and it's something that
you're really really going to use the
crap out of so it is worth the money so
it took his advice and I bought it and I
couldn't be happier with it I love this
it is very very sturdy so if it's
perfectly in a suitcase I'm actually
going to be going to California for a
day while I'm in Miami I'm gonna fly to
California for like one or two days and
I'm so excited of never been to
California and I thought this would be
perfect because it will fit right into
our suitcase and none of the makeup will
get crushed or anything because it is
pretty sturdy so it's definitely a
really good made product by the way
these compartments were here all come
off this right here is a zipper and then
this detaches and it comes completely
off and then these compartments right
here they're magnetic so they come off
perfectly just like this and then
they'll just snap right back on and the
magnet has a pretty strong hold like a
really strong hold so they all come off
which is super convenient you could just
pack it throw it right back in there and
you're good to go
so yeah let's get started so I'm going
to start off with the primer I'm going
to be taking on my trip and I'm going to
take this Laura Mercier foundation
primer this actually came as a sample
with this guy and I thought it was
perfect because it is a travel size I
have this which is my favorite primer
right now this hangover primer but for
traveling purposes I thought I would go
ahead and take this one and I actually
like the way this feels on my skin I
might buy the full size it seemed pretty
hydrating and my foundation went on
really nicely so I'm going to pop that
in right here I recommend finding things
that are in travel size they're just
going to fit a lot better in your makeup
bag and it's going to kind of like not
take up so much space so I'm only taking
one foundation I will be there for two
and a half weeks but I think that one
foundation is good enough for me I don't
want to pack overboard you know so the
foundation I'm going to be taking is my
makeup forever HD foundation this
new foundation to me I purposely bought
it for this trip because I know I'm
going to be taking a lot of pictures in
California and I wanted something that
was going to photograph well and also
for traveling purposes I loved
foundations with a pump because it is
super clean it doesn't get messy it's
just the perfect foundation to travel
with in my opinion so that's the one I'm
taking the bat foundation I find that I
don't need a setting powder at all it
kind of leaves like a natural satin
finish and it doesn't stay tacky to the
touch so I'm not going to be taking a
powder again I have dry skin so I rarely
use face powder to be honest so I don't
feel the need to take that and so the
next thing I need is concealer and I'm
going to be taking my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer because this is honestly the
most perfect ideal concealer it looks
great it blends really well it is glass
so not super ideal for traveling but I
find that if I keep it in a sturdy place
like this it does fine so I will be
adding that and then I'm going to throw
this in because you guys know it's my
favorite concealer in the world and it's
the Maybelline fit me so whenever I
don't want to use Pro Longwear I will go
jump on this guy I'm going to take two
bronzers and normally I would only take
one I don't want it to take any more
natural looking bronzer for a more
day-to-day look and I am taking my Too
Faced milk chocolate Soleil this is a
light bronzer not too light it is the
runs ring right now but it's one of
those runs that just looks good on a day
to day basis and it smells good another
thing I really recommend for traveling
is finding products that have like a
multi-purpose things that are like
two-in-ones you know that serve more
than one purpose so that is why I am
taking my it cosmetics ombre bronzer
because it is a bronzer and a highlight
all-in-one so I love this bronzer
because it is a little bit deeper than
my milk chocolate a little warmer and
then I have a more shimmery bronzer in
the middle and then a highlight I need
to take an extra highlight on my trip
because it already has it in this
product and honestly one highlight is
all I need another huge tip I can give
you is using your Z palettes try to buy
a Z palette if you don't have one
because it just comes in handy you can
put so many things in a Z palette not
just eyeshadows now
I do have this Z palette right here that
is full of makeup geek eyeshadows but
honestly in my opinion these are not
super super convenient for travel
because they are a little flimsy and
they're magnetic they could just like
slip open in your suitcase or something
so I don't really love these for travel
I did find this amazing palette that
I've never heard anybody talk about on
YouTube and I don't know why I got this
I bought this off the makeup geek
website and it is their gunmetal to go
palette the word to go really stood out
at me because I wanted the perfect
palette to travel with and I found it
this palette is amazing because it has a
giant mirror the Z palette Eirik the
regulars you palettes do not have a
mirror so this is ideal for traveling it
has a huge huge mirror and it's a decent
size it's not super big but it's not
small either and it completely closes
shut so like you know it's closed and
it's not flimsy at all while the other Z
palettes are flimsy this one super super
sturdy if I could highly recommend
anything in this video it's this
gunmetal to go palette I got it off the
makeup geek website and it is so ideal
for traveling so I will be popping this
right into this um this little pocket
right here but first we're going to fill
it of course join this palette I'm gonna
add a bunch of different things not just
eye shadows or blushes or anything but
this part I go a little bit overboard
and I'm actually going to be taking
three of my makeup geek blushes maybe I
should take two but I'm going to take
three I'm going to take my favorite one
in honeymoon just gonna pop it in right
here I'm also going to take smitten just
in case I want a warmer cheek and then
I'm going to take spellbound because it
is matte and pretty much goes with any
makeup look so these are my three ideal
blushes to take for traveling and then
I'm going to pop in this right here this
is from Mac and it is their emphasized
powder this is what I use to set my
under eye concealer all the time so I'm
definitely going to be adding that to
this palette the Mac magnets don't
really stick to z pellets all that well
but whatever so the next thing I'm
popping into this palette is something
that I got from Ben Nye
I bought this at camera-ready cosmetics
calm and it is their powder Rouge in
contour number one if you guys watch my
videos you've seen me use this this is
the perfect contouring powder so if I
want to do like a strong chiseled cheek
bone I always go for this and what I
love about this is that it pops right
out of this compact and it has a magnet
so I just pop this right into my Z
palette so just in this tiny palette I
already have my contour my highlight and
my blushes basically the perfect face
palette all you need and then because I
do have some room I'm going to be
popping in my new makeup forever artist
eyeshadows these eyeshadows are amazing
and super pigmented and buttery and
they're just right up my alley so I'm
just going to stick them in my palette
because I know I will be using them so
I'm going to take this one right here
it's a matte color it is m600 pop this
in right here and then I'm going to take
this gold one I love using this on an
everyday basis just all over my lids
this is i-66 - yeah I'm gonna pop that
right here and then I'm going to take
this one it's a more deeper bronzy shade
and this is d65 - gonna pop that in
right here and then I have my full
palette of course you could always just
grab a few makeup geek eyeshadows and
put them in right here and you pretty
much have your whole face palette and
your whole eye palette more makeup geek
shadows will fit in this because the
makeup forever eyeshadows are really
large so you'll be able to fit a couple
more makeup geek eyeshadows in this
thing but I will be packing some makeup
geek eyeshadows anyway but I just
decided to fill up this palette so this
palette is awful ready to go with a
bunch of different things in it and then
it just slips right into this pocket if
you really really love Z palettes if you
don't want to get the gunmetal palette I
do recommend this one right here this is
their tiny little Z palette this is the
smallest one they carry and it holds
nine makeup geek eyeshadows it also
holds nine Mac eyeshadows as well but
you have to put the magnet and behind
Mac eyeshadows so in this palette I will
be taking more makeup geek eyeshadows
because I will be in Miami for two and a
half weeks and sometimes I go to special
occasions and I want my eye makeup to
look a little more you know you know
first one being Shemesh
because like I said earlier in the video
you want to use multi-purpose products I
use this as a face highlight all the
time this is the highlighter I have on
my cheekbones right now look at the
highlight it is beautiful so not only is
it a great brow bone highlight it's a
great lid color and a great face
highlight so that's going in there then
I'm taking creme brulee this is the
perfect everyday crease shade I'm going
to take preppy because it's a perfect
create as well but it has a different
undertone so it's nice for different
looks
another matte color I'm taking is
unexpected because it is purple and it's
perfect if I want to use a little bit
more color and to pair off with
unexpected I'm going to take prom night
these looks so nice together when I
don't want to do just brown chocolate
gold looks I'm going to take my favorite
favorite intense gold eyeshadow in gold
digger this looks great all over the lid
and then I'm going to take my favorite
makeup you guys shadow in mocha this
just completes any look and then of
course corrupt I can't go anywhere
without corrupt because you always need
a black eyeshadow this little space
right here I'm leaving it for this guy
right here
this is a Mac eye shadow in the shade
cork and the reason why I'm adding it to
this palette is because this is the eye
shadow I use to fill in my eyebrows and
you know mama is attached to her
eyebrows so I need to add it in this
palette I just need to get the little
magnet that goes um in the back I have
it like in a drawer somewhere so I have
to get it but that is what I have in
this palette so I have my eyeshadows I
have a face highlight and I even have my
brow powder okay keeping in theme with
the eyes here this video is so long I'm
going to take one liquid eyeliner I'm
not going to take a gel or anything and
the liquid eyeliner I'm taking is this
one by Jessie's Girl it's their
waterproof lick of eyeliner and it's
perfect to travel with because it is in
pen form and I don't have to bother with
opening up a pot getting a brush dipping
it in and then doing a line I could just
pop this top open and I'm good to go and
then of course I need just a basic
eyeliner and that is my Maybelline
master drama eyeliner Holy Grail
eyeliner that's popping in here I'm also
obviously going to be taking an eye
primer and eye
decided to go with this one this is the
Milani shadow eyes and almond cream I
decided to go with this one because not
only does it prime my eyes it covers up
all the veins on my eyes and I use it as
an inner rim eyeliner so when I want my
eyes to look extra bright and I don't
want to use the Maybelline master drama
because it's black
I want something to make my eyes look
bigger I pop this on so it's an eye
primer and eyeliner all-in-one I'm also
throwing in just tweezers just in case
and my eyelash curler the mascara I'm
going with is my Too Faced better than
sex mascara and I'm using this one
because not only is it one of my
favorite mascaras but I have one in a
travel size so it takes up less space
great mascara I'm also going to pop in
my Holy Grail eyebrow product this is
the Anastasia brow Wiz this is also the
perfect traveling brow product I prefer
this over like the brow pomade or
anything like that because it has a
spoolie on one side and the little pen
form on the other and it's so easy to
just comb out your brows and then fill
them in and it's travel-friendly
love this now this part is optional but
I'm going to take some falsies just in
case I go anywhere fancy during the
nighttime and the falsies I'm taking are
these guys right here these are my lower
lashes in wispy sweet nothing wispy
sweet nothing yet the reason why I'm
taking this is because it already comes
in a really sturdy box as opposed to
regular falsies from the drugstore that
come in something like this I can get
easily squished honestly these are not
my fav I don't think they're worth the
price I did purchase this myself
and I actually haven't used these yet
but I've used Eschete I haven't used
these yet but I do have some mosquito
lashes that I just think my Ardell
whispies are better and just a lot
cheaper but I figured for traveling
purposes this might work out for me so
that is why I'm taking it because it
comes in a sturdy box but once I'm done
wearing the crap out of these eyeshadows
because I better use these like 50 times
because today was expensive
once I'm done using this I'm just going
to pop in regular whispies from our
dough and then travel with them in this
box so anyway I am
taking this and then I'm going to take
my favorite lash glue and that is my
eyelash adhesive from house of lashes so
moving on to lips I'm going to take two
lip liners one is an anti feathering lip
liner it's a clear lip liner that goes
with anything and it is from Milani and
then I'm going to take my Too Faced
perfect lips lip liner in the shade
perfect nude because it's I can't live
without this so I got take it you guys
know I'm a major major lip junkie I
can't live without my lip products but I
narrowed it down to three somewhat and I
decided for traveling purposes it's best
to go with a nude a pink and a red at
least for me because I usually wear
either one of those three colors so for
my nude I am taking my Too Faced
lipstick and naked dolly I've just come
to the realization that this is my Holy
Grail nude lipstick it's probably my
favorite nude I have ever come across I
actually put on recently a max creme de
nude and I was like hmm nope
I like naked dolly more I read I am
taking my Cielo all day liquid lipstick
in fiery this is perfect because I will
be a mammy like in the fall time I don't
think the fall starts till September
20th but still I love a deep red
lipstick and if I ever go out somewhere
fancy while I'm down there and I want a
red lip I want this one because it lasts
all day and then for my pink I am taking
my Tarina Tarantino showroom lipstick
and I wanted to take this one because it
feels like a chapstick almost like it's
a balm feeling very very smooth and
buttery and it's one of those products
that I don't need to use a mirror with
it's so easy and I love the color so
that is my pink but then I have to
include these because I think they're
perfect for travel and it gives me four
extra lipsticks and just two these are
my bite Beauty travel little lip
products I have this one right here that
has two more nudie shades which is
perfect because nudes are the colors I
wear most it has this one right here it
has lychee on one end and then it has
musk on the other and it's a bit of a
darker nude so this is perfect to travel
with guys like if you can pick these up
at Sephora they're literally ideal for
traveling
you'll take up no space and then this
one is awesome because it has violet on
one side it's a very very vibrant purple
and then it has Palomino on the other
and it is a more pinky reddish like hot
fuchsia love it so I'm throwing that in
there as well and ask for makeup remover
wipes I keep these in my purse just so
that it doesn't take up any space in my
makeup bag and wipes are just ideal in
my purse because I've ever need it
quickly it's in my purse
so that is another thing that I would
recommend for traveling is makeup
remover wipes and they stay in my purse
now this comes with the perfect little
slots for makeup brushes and this flap
protects like the hairs on it it's
really cool so the first thing I'm going
to be taking is my foundation brush I
would normally put on my foundation with
my Beauty Blender for traveling I think
this is more ideal because I don't need
to run this under water or anything like
that by the way I will be washing these
brushes today the rest of this makeup
will stay in here but I need to wash
these brushes today because I did use it
for my makeup today and I leave tomorrow
night so I have to take these out and
wash them but then I'll put them back in
tomorrow the next brush I'm taking is a
brush that I figured would be like a
multitasking brush so I'm taking my Real
Techniques blush brush because I can use
this for contouring or like bronzing and
I could use this for blush as well then
I have to take my Holy Grail concealer
brush and it is my Real Techniques
contour brush it's perfect it blends my
concealer and sets my concealer just
fantastic and I could always just clean
this off on a towel use it to highlight
or use it to contour it's very
multitasking I'm also going to take this
brush this is my just in case brush it
is the elf flawless concealer brush I
feel like this does everything contour
setting highlight and I'm just taking it
just in case my other brush is dirty
then that's it for face brushes these
are the only face brushes I need fry
brushes I am just taking a flat shader
brush this is from Mac I'm taking my Mac
217 alo I'm going to take my Sigma e-40
it is a fluffy blending brush we all
need one of those I'm taking my pencil
brush from Sigma so I use underneath my
Asha's and then I'm taking this makeup
geek outer-v brush because I use this
for so many things as well obviously my
eyebrow brush because I can't put my
eyebrows on without it an angled brush
because you never know and then another
flat shader brush because you never know
so as you can see they just fit so
perfectly in this and you just close the
flap and then you're good so this is
everything right here it just fits so
perfectly then you just close it and zip
it up and then it's in this perfect
little binder here that just fits
everything so snuggly and nice okay guys
so that is it I just wanted to have you
guys with me while I packed my makeup
for Miami thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this video wasn't too
long and maybe you learned something or
something I don't know I really love you
guys um please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
