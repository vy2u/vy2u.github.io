a what's in my travel makeup bag so I'm
gonna be discussing everything I had in
my bag and what I take with me when I
travel this is the second time I'm
filming this video and if you do YouTube
videos you know that one of the most
frustrating things is filming the same
video for a second time so I'd know my
light I had to take one out because it
stopped working
you guys saw one of my previous videos I
kind of went into detail and now this
one is not working anymore you can see
like the light isn't as bright I got a
ton of you guys that recommended fairy
lights that last longer you said to get
like LED lights those lasts longer I'm
not sure so I'm gonna go shopping online
for more lights that actually last long
cuz these don't last and I bought these
at Home Depot you would think that they
would last long because they were like
for outdoors but no okay so I'm going to
go ahead and get started keep in mind
that honestly the things in this bag
changes depending on where I'm going but
I'm just going to give you a general
view the contents in this bag is pretty
much what I take with me when I travel I
wanted to do this video to give you guys
tips maybe you don't exactly know like
what kind of things you should take or
what hopefully this video is helpful so
this is my makeup bag of choice I bought
this on the Sephora website this is
called the vacationer I believe that's
what it's called I had my Laura Mercier
one and I loved it I still use it it
fits a lot of stuff but I wanted
something with a handle that one is kind
of like a binder I just wanted something
more practical a little bit more compact
something I could carry and just to
simplify so this was like $40 which is
pretty pricey for a makeup bag
considering you can get like a ton of
makeup bags at Target but I love this
one it's very sturdy
it fits everything I highly highly
highly recommend this bag if you're
someone who travels a lot because you
could just fit so much okay so when you
open it this is what it looks like so
when you open it this is what mine looks
like on the inside
I really love this bag because of its
compartments so on the top here is where
I keep my makeup brushes it has eight
slots for you to take eight makeup
brushes which honestly you don't need
any more than eight brushes kind of
trained myself to just take what I need
so a big tip I can tell you is to take
brushes that do just more than one job
that is a major tip because you can use
that brush for a ton of different things
so here I have the elf ultimate blending
brush I really like traveling with this
brush because it applies foundation
really really nicely like it buffs it
into the skin and it also buffs in my
concealer at the same time and then I
always always always take my Real
Techniques multitask brush because it
does exactly that it multitasks I mainly
use this for bronzer and blush and then
the last face brush I only bring three
but I really really love the morphe 48
because I can blend out my concealer
with this I can set my concealer with
this I can highlight my cheekbones with
this and I can contour with this this
does so many things and then the rest of
the five slots are for eye brushes
I love taking this brush with me to
travel because it's a like double sided
brush I typically don't like double
sided brushes because they're really
hard to store you don't want to mess up
one side of the brush by like slamming
it into a brush holder but they're
really great to travel with I'm not
wearing any lipstick how weird I just
noticed that I'm going to apply some oh
this is the Tarte lip sculptor in basic
if anybody was wondering okay back to
what I was saying everything just fell
out of this all of a sudden this is the
Kat Von D shade + light brush I like it
because it has kind of like a buffing
brush on one side and the pencil brush
on the end I have to travel with a
pencil brush they're very important to
me for that lower lash line and then the
other side is perfect to like buff out
concealer buffer pad pot on your eye and
you
and then I have this brush right here I
feel like these kinds of brushes are
just essential with any makeup look I do
I always reach for like a Mac 217 this
is the same shape as a Mac 217 but this
is a Sophie 320 I have tons of brushes
that have this kind of shape but to me
they're just essential because they work
for the outer corners in the crease they
just I need this kind of brush so I
usually take that and then I have the
elf one dollar little shader brush
because you need a shader brush and then
to crease brushes this is the Sephora
Pro crease brush it's just extremely
soft it has the perfect shape and I love
it and then this is the morphe 5 1/4
it's significantly smaller than this one
which is perfect if I don't want to do
like insane buffing in the crease if I
just want a light wash in the crease so
with those eight brushes I can do like a
full on full face look ok so then here
this has little slots just like this
does like for your brushes I don't
exactly know what these slots here are
for but I keep my lip products here and
I'll go into detail about what I have
here when I go into the lips category
but right now I'm going to show you how
I like to pack my bag so I definitely
always take this with me when I travel
this is the Sephora color switch by Vera
Mona I had the original Vera Mona one
and I lost it so I bought the one that
they sell at Sephora what this does is
it allows you to use the same brush in
like a ton of different colors because
when you're traveling you're like sure
yeah I want to take a brush that I can
use 20 different ways but if I dip my
brush into a blue eyeshadow how am I
going to dip it into like a black and
then apply it to my lids I don't want to
mix colors that's what this is for so
you can apply your like lid shade swirl
your brush in this and then dip it into
another color and it won't transfer okay
so when I sit down and pack this bag I
kind of go through my mind and I do it
in order so the first thing I apply to
my face is primer so usually I will pack
two primers but in this case I packed
three and I'll tell you why in a second
100% of the time I always pack my makeup
forever step one skin equalizer in
smoothing because this is my favorite
pore filling primer and then I will
always take an illuminating primer with
it and this is the NYX born to glow
illuminate
primer so beautiful it gives your skin
like a beautiful glow and then I will
also take this because I don't like to
travel with foundations that have SPF in
it because sometimes I'm taking pictures
and SPF will give like a weird flashback
so I like to take a foundation with zero
SPF but of course if I'm gonna be
wearing foundation during the day I want
to be protected by the Sun so I have
been loving this one this is pretty new
I bought mine at Sephora this is the dr.
jart every Sunday UV illuminating
sunscreen this has SPF 36 and it's just
basically a sunscreen like any regular
old face sunscreen but it illuminates
it's very glowy and beautiful let me
show you and you can tell pointless and
next up is foundation so I highly
recommend traveling with a foundation
that's travel friendly though no glass
bottles which kind of sucks because my
all-time favorite foundation in history
of the world is the makeup rubber face
and body and it's in a glass bottle so I
still travel with that I wrap it in like
a bunch of socks and put it in my
suitcase so that it doesn't break but
that's just a hassle that sometimes I
don't want to do I do it because it's my
favorite but you know like I don't want
to do it so another great foundation
that I love traveling with is my Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD stick this isn't a
plastic thing and it's perfect to travel
because you take this off take this off
and you just like slap it on your face
and then you buff it in with a brush
it's literally the easiest foundation in
the world another big tip I can give you
is traveling with squeezy tube
foundations I wish to be completely
honest with you that every foundation
was in a squeezy tube cuz yes I do love
the glass bottles and they look so
pretty but things are just so practical
you open it just squeeze it so easy this
is the Kiko universal fit hydrating
foundation I really do like traveling
with this one too for that reason but
yeah I only take one foundation because
I feel like that's all I need and the
next step is concealer I take one
concealer with me it's my travel friend
because it's plastic it's in a wand it's
easy to apply and it's my favorite
concealer of all time this is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer I have mine in
vanilla
and then powder my arse EMA no color
powder is my all-time favorite powder
but it's not the best to travel with
when you're on the go so I take my it
cosmetics bye bye pours airbrush powder
I find it to be so perfect because it
really does diminish my pores sets my
makeup beautifully it says my under eyes
beautifully it's an all-in-one great
powder and so the next category is
bronzer blush and highlight I take one
bronzer and nine times out of ten it's
my NARS Laguna bronzer because it's
really sturdy I find that this is really
great to travel with it's great to
contour but it does also great to bronze
and sometimes you don't find bronzers
that do both I find that it isn't too
orange it's not really really warm so
you can still contour with this but
there's a little bit of a sheen to it
not too much but enough to give you a
glow at the same time okay so for blush
and highlight I take these two bad boys
this is the elf total face palette and I
really like this palette because huge
mirror and you get different products in
this palette so you get a bronzer two
blushes and a highlight to me personally
this highlight isn't like BAM enough for
me to highlight but it is a really
pretty like soft veil of powder like if
I'm looking a little bit too flat too
matte which isn't often but if I want
just a little bit more glow to the rest
of my face I will throw that on so I
love traveling with that and then you
get a peach blush and a pink blush and
they're both matte and then you have a
bronzer here which is perfect it's the
perfect undertone for my skin tone to
contour with so if I did want to contour
a little bit more I'll just go ahead and
use this and then I love taking this
with me as well this is the man eyes or
sisters this is from the balm this was
sent to me but they saw this at Kohl's
and it's great because when you open it
you have the three Luminizer 's you have
the mary lou manizer the cindy lou
manizer and the betty loumanizer
and i find that i cannot travel with the
mary lou manizer or any of them because
they break really easily the balm
highlights these they break so easily
but this guy right here does not break
easily what's great about this is that
the mary-lou manizer it's just a
universally great highlight no matter
what look you're doing the Cindy
Luminizer is one of my favorite like
blushes and then this is great kind of
like as a bronzing duster on my body on
my eyes it's really great so I love
traveling with this but I always throw
in kind of like a creamy highlighting
product and recently the color pop smoke
and whistles has been my favorite I find
that these travel really well plastic
it's really great and this is just like
a really pretty pinky undertone and then
the only thing I have for the rest of
the face is this bad boy right here I
have to have some sort of setting spray
with me when I travel and I love this
one because it's tiny I have the
full-size here which I love you can tell
it's like I love this is the makeup
forever mist and fixed love using this
to make my eyeshadows more intense of
spring this before my makeup after my
makeup it does set my makeup and it
makes my makeup last throughout the
entire day so I bought the little mini
size to travel with okay and then the
next category is eyes we already covered
everything from the lip from the face
and still got some more goodies in here
so for the eyes I don't take an eye
primer because I use my NARS radiant
creamy concealer as a primer and then I
just said it a very dry lids
so I don't ever get oily lids throughout
the day though that's why I get away
with using a concealer eyeshadow palette
of choice is always going to be my Too
Faced chocolate bar palette because I
can just do so many different looks with
this it's neutral which most of the time
is what I go for
and it's very sleek very compact it's in
a tin so it's great to travel with by
the way I've been grabbing these things
from these two sides this kind of has
like four compartments in a way it has
this side right here which I already
took everything out of it has one in the
middle that has kind of like a a velcro
and then it has this slot right here and
then it has a little pocket right here
so before I go into this middle
compartment right here I might as well
just show you what's left out here I
take makeup remover wipes with me no
matter where I go no matter where I
travel to and here I just have the
cleansing spa waters by Koh Shindo I
bought these on Sephora because they had
really great reviews and they are really
really great and they're great
travel with because they're so thin they
don't have that many in them and then
here and digitally the courier right
here to sedate a pocket I keep this this
is from House of lashes I bought it on
the House of lashes website and this is
where I keep my falsies when I travel
have a bigger one that I have as well
which is awesome to like throw in your
suitcase if you're traveling for like a
really long period of time but most of
the time this works for me what I don't
like about this is that it is pretty
bulky it's like you know it's pretty
bulky I mean it fits perfectly fine in
this but it's kind of bulky you open it
and it's awesome it has a freaking
mirror it's awesome though and you just
keep your lashes in here these are
whispies from Amazon I just keep three
falsies in here but what I do love about
it is this little compartment back here
so I mean it's bulky but for a reason
back here um I just keep a tiny little
house of lashes glue they sell the mini
glue on their website and then I keep my
scissors in here just in case I have to
trim down any lashes from down my
eyebrows who knows they fit perfectly in
this little tin okay when you open does
you poke it you see all of the good
stuff and in this pocket right here I
like to keep lip liners eyeliners
mascaras you know like bra products to
be kind of products so they're just not
thrown in this bag and I'm taking
forever rummaging through it and looking
for it all those skinny little products
are right here in this pocket for
eyeliners I usually take two I take like
a black and a brown sometimes I'll throw
in the third one they're like a pop of
color but I love taking my NYX pleasure
Lee eyeliners because they're my
favorite this black one this is in the
shade pitch black it's my favorite black
eyeliner ever but the best part is my
biggest tip to you guys is to take lip
liners and eyeliners that are
retractable yes you can take a sharpener
and just sharpen it but sometimes you'll
just get like the shavings all over your
bag like the sharpener will pop open and
you'll just have a mess everywhere and
personally when I'm traveling I don't
want the hassle of sitting there and
sharpening everything so retractable
products are my favorite to travel with
so I always take the NYX pledge really
gel pencil in black and in brown I'll
usually throw in like a fun pop of color
from colour-pop this is the color pop
cream gel liner
and show me it's kind of like a bronze
metallic color and it's retractable so
it's perfect
and then the last two things I take for
eyes to complete a full eye is a liquid
liner besides the fact that I do
typically prefer a liquid liner I always
would prefer it when I travel because
you don't want to take like a pot and
then a brush liquid liners are just
easier so my favorite one is definitely
the bombs
Schwing and then of course you got to
take mascara on my all-time favorite
mascara is this one this is the Kegel
extra sculpt Volume Mascara I just
it's the mist and for brows I just bring
two products I take a brow pencil of
some sort and then a brow gel this is
the Anastasia brow definer love this and
then my favorite my favorite this is the
Loreal brow stylist plumper in light to
medium it's just a brow gel but it has
like magical fibers in him it just makes
my brows look really like thick
voluminous and amazing voluminous can
browse be voluminous who knows and then
the last thing in this little section
are my lip liners and my lip balm this
is the glossy a coconut balm calm I need
to take lip balm with me when I travel
so and these are the lip liners I take I
really try to limit myself if there's
one product I love is lip products I
love changing up my lip color because
you guys know a lot of the time I love
putting on just like mascara and a bold
lip these are the three lip liners I
like to travel with because they are
retractable you'd be surprised a lot of
my lip liners I have to sharpen
but I love these for that I always focus
on three main colors I'll take a nude a
pink and like a red I find that with
those colors I pretty much cover all the
bases so my favorite nude to travel with
is the Rimmel exaggerate in natural it
has like the perfect undertone it's so
pretty it looks really natural on the
lips and it goes with so many different
nudes and browns and any color and then
this is the Marc Jacobs how long wear
lip liner very long wearing this is an
honey bun it's just a really pretty pink
goes with so many pink lip options and
then I really love this one to travel
with this is from the brand
Besame I bought this on Sephora and it's
a
ended lipliner they're very similar
colors though I do wish that they would
have been different but they're just
very similar one side has like a
burgundy and the other side has like a
red and then the last thing in my bag
here are my lip products I don't even
think these little things are to hold
lipsticks but I use them to hold
lipsticks so the first one I have is the
Revlon stormy pink if I want to wear
like a lot of mascara and just have kind
of like a pop of color I really love
stormy pink by Revlon one of my favorite
new lipsticks of all time is this one
right here and they don't make it
anymore which breaks my heart this is my
second one actually this is the bite
Beauty luminous cream lipstick in red
Cena
so beautiful can't believe it'll make
red seen any more it's the perfect nude
this goes with so many different eye
looks love it and then this lipstick
right here is from NYX and it's whipped
caviar I always like to take kind of
like a mid-tone pink and then the last
three slots are for my liquid lipsticks
this changes so much when I travel it's
like not even funny but these two are
from Stila this is steel a patina and
fiery they do have these in a full-size
- like for sale on Sephora but I bought
this in a little holiday set so I love
taking this a travel with me because
they're so little and just easy they
don't take up much space and then same
goes for this this is a color pop liquid
lipstick in the shade
I caught it in a little holiday tree Oh
perfect to travel with because it's so
small oh yeah that completes this video
because that's it I'm done there's
nothing else in here I love this they
actually have the same one in a really
pretty tropical looking bag like for the
summertime and I think that one is
limited edition but I just love that you
can fit so much in this oh yeah that
completes this video I know it was long
but I hope I gave you like some tips
along the way and what I like to travel
