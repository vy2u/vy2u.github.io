a what's in my purse video this video
has been highly requested and I have
done it before but like two years ago I
haven't done this video since like I
started my channel like ogee videos like
back in the dizzle I haven't done this
video in forever
and recently it's just been highly
highly requested so I thought I would do
it for you guys so this is my purse this
is a Michael Kors if I knew the name I
would tell you I don't even think
actually I don't think Michael Kors have
like names like Louie Vuitton has names
and like all those other friends say
your purses have names but I freaking
love Michael Kors this isn't an offense
to anyone at all at all I like drop mad
money on makeup and people look at me
like I'm crazy but I just don't see
myself paying so much for a purse this I
got it on sale for like $200 it was like
3d something and I got it on sale so so
kind of a funny story not really but I
do have a couple of other Michael Kors
purses and I kind of switch them out
depending on like my clothing or
depending on like the the mood I'm in
which purse I feel like carrying and
recently I got this one not too long ago
because it was just one pocket like just
one pocket just like one big pocket and
all my other purses have like
compartments in them like the front like
the middle zipper the back like you know
slots and I don't know if this happens
to anybody I know it's gonna sound
really weird but I get massive anxiety
with compartments like I'm not like I'm
not kidding sometimes I'll put like a
pen in the back slot when it's supposed
to go in the front slot and I have crazy
like anxiety the whole day it ties into
my OCD and it's really strange
but I thought you know what I'm gonna
buy a purse that just has one big hole
in it
so that these slots and compartments
don't drive me crazy does that make any
sense please comment down below if that
happens to anybody
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started I've been carrying around this
purse for a while and I haven't emptied
it or fixed it up so I'm just gonna
start pulling things out this is just
real life guys real life so I always
keep my wallet with me of course this is
the wallet that I carry with me no
matter what purse I have I love this
wallet is my Michael Kors I'm like a
little bit obsessed with Michael Kors
and yes this is what it looks like I'm
not gonna show my driver's license but
this is what it looks like I have a
picture of Danny when he joined the
military right here Oh cute and I love
it because it has a place to put your
pen it actually came with that pen and
it has a lot of different slots you
could put a lot of cards dhama VIP pit
CIPA marki my vib Roush that's a little
embarrassing my men cheese card so I
don't always keep a book in my purse cuz
let's face it sometimes books don't
really fit in your purse but I have been
reading this book right here this is my
bookmark this is don't sweat the small
stuff and it's all small stuff by
Richard Carlson simple ways to keep the
little things from taking over your life
I'm almost done with this book I just
threw my bookmark in here though
randomly cuz my bookmark was just like
floating around my purse right now but
anyway I I'm almost done with it it's
really good this is the kind of book you
could read in like a few hours but I
limited myself to reading a couple of
pages per day cuz I wanted I wanted to
prolong the read of this does that make
sense it's such a good book and it makes
me so happy and it really relaxes me and
eases my anxiety and it's just a great
advice book that I wanted to read it as
long as I could so I highly recommend
this book it's fantastic I've got a pen
this is my favorite pen of all time the
pen tell RSVP pens fine tip my favorite
hand sanitizer of course stress relief
we all need that stress relief in our
life
I should go buy some more because I'm
all out of this almost
the car keys with my little Miami Heat
thingy that I put on it this is a little
Eiffel Tower that a subscriber sent to
me so these two guys are right here of
course these are my glasses like to see
I can't see very well from far so
especially at nighttime when I am
driving or at the movies so that I could
see the screen better or when I'm
watching TV here at night in my home you
know
glasses like do I have to explain it
these are from Burberry and I love them
they are so cute
do I look at the little teacher a
librarian I got these at four-eyes the
outlets they have like an outlet for
eyes in Miami and that's where I got
these because they were cheaper there
and I have these these are Ray Bans I
really love my a v8 or a Benz the blue
ones that I have but I wanted something
a lot more comfortable for day to day so
these are in the style of Erika Erika
yes they're called Erika's and there are
the most comfortable sunglasses in the
history of the world
they're amazing so cocky they're not
even on my face are they on my face
because I can't feel them I have this in
my purse this is Oahu coconuts sunset
from Bath and Body Works it's my
favorite summer splash from Bath and
Body Works dark kiss is my favorite
overall but they don't sell it in stores
anymore I got to get it online why am I
going off on a tangent here
wahoo coconut sunset even though I spray
perfume before I leave the house I just
keep a little mini body splash cozy
oh this is saris feet to Ikea
Mike yeah receipt just recently bought
some shelves they're right there but you
can't see them um Little John melona
thingies
these are little what do these call
dumb-dumbs pops in blue berry and blue
raspberry raspberry is my favorite I cut
out sugar in my life so I don't know how
these got there I got this on my local
NEX like
bass and I thought this thing would be
perfect for me I have nothing in it yet
but I think it's perfect for me for when
I travel or this is gonna sound really
crazy but I don't like to carry around a
huge purse all the time especially if
I'm gonna be walking around places a lot
because you know I'm crazy and paranoid
and I just want people seeing me carry
around this big purse it's that weird I
know but I think this is perfect because
my phone fits in here perfectly right
here my phone just slides in here and
then I could just put my ID and a couple
of debit cards or whatever and then just
close this and just take this everywhere
with me because that's all I need I
could put some change back here you know
so I have my money my card my ID and my
phone all in this little guy and I don't
always have to carry around this big
purse so that is why I purchased this
and that's why it's like empty I keep it
in my purse just in case I just want to
switch it out and you know use this for
the day so yeah I have Danny's keys oh
the spare keys even though he drives a
humongous truck that I could never drive
in a million years so that's really
pointless I have this lipstick from it
cut this I'm mean we're not done
yet random crap in here this is a
cosmetics by Title II but what vitality
lip flush and Jenna sake Watson why keep
this in here because this stuff is
amazing if you saw my recent Sephora
haul this is the wire saw of a loop Ted
Tintin oils
it's a tinted oil it's like the best
thing for your lips ever oh another
receipt to Sephora of course I have done
Donny's who is Donny
I have Danny's dog tag in my purse
and I put like a little chain on it to
like wear it as a necklace cuz I'm weird
like that Irene one of these rings to
perfume roller balls this is Versace
Versace bright crystal and then
says Elizabeth and James Nirvana the
black one can't have too many perfumes
right I keep a little highlighter marker
in here um because I like to highlight
my books
well like my self-help books and this is
a little monster you can tell but it has
a little face on it and it says monster
on it and it smells like bananas it's my
banana scented highlighter and it's mini
and it's cute some Apple headphone
thingies you know the ones that come
with your phone oh my gosh and an
earring and these were really expensive
I don't know where my other one is and
then I keep my makeup bag this is the
Charlotte Tilbury makeup bag give a
woman the right makeup she can conquer
the world and really quickly I'm just
gonna go through what I have in here cuz
I don't have much like I don't have like
a full face of makeup in here but I keep
my favorite Revlon lip butter in cupcake
which I haven't been able to find at the
drugstore anymore and it's starting to
worry me this cool mister ah like a
brush I keep it in my purse cuz
obviously it's not gonna get effed up
because it's in this thing I actually
got this in a boxy charm keep it in
there because I keep a baked bronzer
from elf in my purse just in case I'm
looking a little like a ghostly one day
I don't know this cool Sephora I
remember was I wouldn't say it's cool
but it's same mirror that I got at
Sephora a soft lips lip balm really cute

I think it's vanilla blistex medicated
lip balm mmm SPF 15 this little light
just in case
I don't know I have another lip-balm
Bioderma silk stick hydration I like
this about derma lip balm so I have it
and then the four last things in this
makeup bag are a mascara this is just a
regular makeup forever like travel
mascara this is an echo liquid black
eyeliner just in case and then a brown
eyeliner from em cosmetics in bronze
kiss Justin kgs and a Paris or an Eiffel
Tower a bottle opener cuz you know I
don't know why actually it was a gift
for my cousin and I keep it in my purse
because it's really cute and sometimes I
like sparkling water and you need to pop
it open at a restaurant with one of
these actually that's not true because
they open it for you at the restaurant
so I I don't know why I have this I used
to carry around a big box in my purse I
was like a heart-shaped box that Danny
got me when he went to Africa and Danny
was like stop carrying that in your
purse it was like a big box I mean I
don't wish so I stopped carrying it okay

purse but I do have like little sections
