I've only met beauty bloggers or make
some beauty bloggers that are like
pretty fucking cool yeah yeah but that
wasn't the question I've been to like
four events in my entire career

you've ever told a boyfriend okay
so Amelia had this boyfriend named
George he had a brother named Steven who
I was like madly in love with
boyfriend's with you I nobody mention
him in a video yeah yeah he was a real
nice I was like in love with Steven like
while I was singing with him so her mom
used to drop us off at Georgian will end
Steven's house on the weekends I used to
live with him and Tom how is that I mean
this house bells really has beaten a
good time oh my god do you remember
those like old phones that were like
blue and they were like orange they were
the orange yeah one and my little
screensaver said William and Kathleen
and one time looking Steven changed it
when I was in the bathroom when he
changes to Steven and Kathleen on my
screen saver when I left to school the
next day
William saw my screensaver that said
Kathleen and scene he was what is this
and I was like was it me
it was bad but I used to lie to William
all the time about my god I just sad
because you know what was a really nice
person mine is a little bit worse than
yours because I recently was looking at
my like I messages on my computer and it
showed my old messages to my
ex-boyfriend which I will remain
nameless
I said remain nameless
I literally the day before I broke up
with him was telling him how I wanted to
make a work with him before you the
night before I broke up with him on 30
like listen I want to make this work
we're such a great couple and then the
next day I broke his heart and then why
would I broke his heart I'll never
forget I was literally there breaking up
with him and then I said it's like if
you want to keep talking I know all this
is like guys I'm a little bit hungry can
we go to in and out and we keep talking
about this and in the Drecker in and out
he was crying and I was eating the

like talking to our Miami's a little bit
depressing Oh have you ever cheated or
