a YouTube made me buy it video if you've
never seen this kind of video which I'm
sure you have because I feel like this
video has always been going around like
I've been seeing it for years but
recently I've been seeing it everywhere
which totally motivated me to do it
myself I'm basically going to be sharing
with you all the products that I
purchased because of youtube I have been
a huge YouTube watcher since I was in
high school it's like all I did I've
been on YouTube for three years but I've
been watching it for about six years now
six or seven and there were so many
things that like everyone was talking
about at the same time things that were
so hyped at the moment that I went out
and purchased it myself
purchases I made because of YouTube and
I'm going to be sharing them with you
whether I like them or not whether I
think they were worth the hype or not
whether I still use them or I don't use
them that much anymore that's what we
will be talking about today so I'm not
gonna go in any order I'm just gonna
grab from this pile and talk about
things and most of these products you
guys will be familiar with because well
it was all over YouTube at one point I'm
going to start with eyeshadow palettes
now I was looking through my collection
and immediately these two palettes stood
out to me one more than the other one
but they were totally both purchased
because of all the hype on YouTube this
one more though this is the Urban Decay
Naked palette if there is one thing in
my collection that automatically reminds
me of YouTube is this out of everything
I own it's this this just brings back so
many memories this is actually the first
high-end purchase I ever really made I
saw three videos on this palette there
were three tutorials by three different
youtubers and I was like obsessed it was
like I needed to have this I saw a video
by candy Johnson she was like in her
bathroom filming a makeup tutorial on
this and then I saw Julia Graff and
Marlina from makeup geek OG youtubers
right there
watching them made me totally buy this
and I don't regret it I used this so
much it was my all-time favorite palette
for so long unfortunately I don't really
use it that much anymore because I have
so many other palettes and I actually
prefer my Too Faced chocolate bar
palette over this one I know everyone
spoke about the Naked palette in their
YouTube made me buy a video but it's
just like the qolt palette all the naked
palettes were like all the rage on
YouTube a few years ago
it definitely goes for the lorac Pro
this is the original lorac Pro I did get
the second one sent to me and then all
the other pro pilots after that have
been sent to me but this one right here
I did purchase myself everyone and de
mama was talking about this everyone had
a makeup tutorial using this palette so
I went out and I purchased it and I
don't love it as much as I love the
Naked palette or the chocolate bar
palette but it is a great palette you
have a row of maths and then a row of
shimmers I personally preferred this one
over the lorac 2 and the 3 and it is
something I don't regret buying because
of youtube I think it was highly
recommended and for a really good reason
so while I was looking at my bronzer
drawer this one immediately jumped out
at me this is the benefit hoola bronzer
this specific one I did not purchase
this has like my name on it and benefit
sent it to me but I did purchase a hoola
I just don't have it anymore because I
purchased it years ago and it was old so
I no longer have it but I remember
buying it because of youtube I feel like
benefit hoola and NARS Laguna bronzer
were the only bronzers people were
talking about a few years ago now so
many companies have so many different
products that you hear different
youtubers talk about different things
but loud everyone was talking about
benefit hoola everyone it's the bronzer
I'm wearing on my face right now I do
like it but I have other bronzers in my
collection that I like a little bit more
but when I did buy I did use it and I I
wore it all the time let me know in the
comments below if you bought hoola
because of youtube or if you bought any
of these because of youtube I remember
the day that I purchased the NARS
radiant creamy concealer for the first
time I was in Mississippi I was in
Sephora and I picked up the shady
custard because this is the shade
everyone was talking about so not only
were people talking about NARS radiant
creamy concealer they were talking about
NARS radiant and custard it's like
everyone was talking about custard so I
went in not knowing and I picked up
custard but it's much too dark for my
under eyes so I went in and ended up
buying vanilla which is my perfect color
for underneath the eyes so I actually
used to use custard as foundation all
the time I would just start it all over
my face and then buff it in with a
blending brush and I love how this looks
as a foundation by the way
their YouTube made me buy a product was
actually the NARS sheer glow there was a
time on YouTube where every single
youtuber was talking about NARS sheer
glow I ended up buying it but it broke
me out so I returned it so I can't talk
about it today but anyway back to these
and I actually love it it's my favorite
concealer to this day this one and the
Tarte shape tape have been my
ride-or-die concealers since I got them
I have repurchased vanilla time and time
and time again love this concealer and
yes I'm so glad you two made me buy the
Jordana best lash extreme was like
everyone's cult favorite mascara for so
long and when I first bought it I didn't
like it I thought that it made my
eyelashes look chubby I don't know this
was even in an old a very very old
disappointing products video this
shocking I know because I actually love
this mascara it's only like two dollars
two or three dollars and it's so
volumizing it's so amazing and I think
the fact that it had such a low price
tag when it was such good quality made
it so hyped on YouTube everyone was
talking about this so worth the hype how
many of you guys and be honest with me
how many of you guys purchased the
freaking mac fix+ because everyone was
talking about it on YouTube I don't hear
anyone talking about fix+ anymore I'm
exaggerating I hear people talk about it
but when I purchased fix+ for the first
time everyone was talking about it it
was like in every video ever this one is
not the original fix plus this is
actually the lavender scent Mac had like
a limited edition fixed plus collection
I had lavender coconut all that when I
first bought fix plus I used it all the
time I always used it to intensify my
shadows if you have been watching me for
a long time on YouTube but I still use
it on my eyeshadows just not as much as
before this is really good to apply to
your face when you are done with your
makeup
once you've already powdered once you've
got all your powder products on your
face you spritz this all over your face
and it like makes your skin look so nice
it takes away the powdery look to your
skin so I really really love fix plus
there's a hundred different uses for it
I don't have to say anything just by
showing you this you guys know you're
like yep YouTube did make you buy that
yeah this is the laura mercier loose
setting powder in the shade translucent
I got the little one because it's
cheaper than the big one I purchased
this after hearing so many people rave
about this till this day it's like the
most raved about powder I think I don't
hear anyone talk about face powders the
way that I hear people talk about Laura
Mercier translucent it's people's cult
powder it's their outer dye powder I
actually like it I think it's a great
powder it just can tend to look a little
bit powdery on my skin if I don't
moisturize but if you have oily skin I
think you would love this powder it is
very pricey but they sell this small one
for around $22 okay so I declutter my
makeup pretty often I mean I still have
a corrupt ton of stuff in my collection
but every once in a while I'll go
through my stuff
donate it give it away send it to Cuba I
always send stuff to Cuba and I was
looking at my foundation collection and
I was like wow
none of these were like really hype
datapoint but then I saw this and I
remembered I remembered the mission I
went on to buy it this is the ex1 and
visit wear liquid foundation there was a
time on YouTube at least for me I saw
everyone raving about this foundation
and I remember when I tried to purchase
it for the first time it was sold out
and I feel like it was sold out for so
long and then it took like forever to
get to me but I felt like I needed to
have it out of all the foundations I
owned there wasn't one that I was
seriously yearning for as much as this
one I loved it the foundation I'm
wearing right now it's been a favorite
foundation ever since I got it I'm in
the shade f-100 and I would say if you
are a little bit lighter than me then
none of the foundations would work for
you because I'm pretty sure f-100 is the
lightest shade I just recently heard
that they came out with a ton of new
colors though they expanded their shade
range I haven't seen it but I'm so glad
they did if they did or if maybe I heard
that as a rumor I don't know but the
majority of their foundations are
targeted towards people with kind of
like an olive undertone it looks so
fresh and natural on the skin but it
will look like that all day it's not
super full coverage like you can totally
see my imperfections through this
foundation but it gives your skin a skin
like look I completely love that it's a
pump I love the packaging it seriously
it's a great foundation and you tube
maybe by okay so this isn't the original
blush I purchased but I gave my
away but this is definitely the blush
that YouTube made me buy this is the
orgasm blush by NARS this one is just in
a special packaging because NARS
recently came out with like an oversized
orgasm blush and then they just ended up
sending it to me
but way back when even before I started
my channel I had purchased NARS orgasm
because I heard everyone raving about it
literally everyone this was the YouTube
blush NARS orgasm
I remember going into the store and
watching it and not loving it but buying
it anyway because I mean everybody else
loved it there huh it has to be perfect
I don't love this blush it's the blush
I'm wearing on my cheeks today I've
always thought it looked ugly on me this
one has a different formula or a
different consistency that I remember
because the orgasm that I purchased
years ago was so chunky it was literally
like chunky uh-huh I'm glittery and it
emphasized all my pores it was just like
a fart of glitter and pink on my face
and I don't know there are so many other
blushes on the market that I love more
so many other NARS blushes I love way
more than orgasm they're only like 100
of you guys watching like what do you
mean does my favorite blush I wish I had
the original Urban Decay primer potion
that I purchased because I loved the old
packaging this is my primer potion in
the shade enigma so totally not what I
want to talk about I just don't have the
original anymore but I remember I went
into Sephora with my friend Amelia and
the woman at Sephora was telling us
about this new primer it was from Urban
Decay it was amazing it was called the
primer potion it came in like an actual
potion the old packaging looked like a
little bottle and I remember she had put
it on the back of her hand and then
applied an eyeshadow on top and me and
Amelia were like floored we were like
what oh my god what is this magic we
were shocked we didn't even know that
you were supposed to put on primer
underneath eyes shadow like we had never
done that before it was just incredible
and I didn't end up buying it but when I
went home that day I was looking on
YouTube and I realized like everyone was
using the primer potion
it was literally everywhere that or the
Too Faced shadow insurance those two
were like the only primers anyone
was using I went like the very next day
I went back to Sephora and I purchased
it I used it all the time and now
looking back I don't really like the
original primer potion anymore I love
this one in enigma because it has color
to it and it's a really nice base but
the original is just like a clear primer
that really does nothing for me honestly
how many of you guys purchased Mac tan
pigment because everyone was raving
about it I'm wearing this on my eyes
today I'm wearing the original Naked
palette all over my eyes but I have this
on my entire lid and as I was putting it
on today I was like oh my gosh why
haven't I used this in so long this is
such a beautiful pigment it was in so
many people's favorites videos like I
remember watching everyone speak about
this I think I even saw a video yeah
makeup by Ali posted a video of her
mixing this in with her foundation and
it looked amazing this was years ago but
I remember thinking like I need mac tan
pigment in my life I also have to give a
shout-out to Mac painterly paint-pot
because everyone was talking about this
mine is already dried out and cracked
I totally need to throw this away ever
since I discovered my enigma primer
potion
I don't even touch painterly they're
both like the same tone but this one is
way less drying than this I bought it
because everyone was talking about it on
YouTube in yeah I mean I used it for so
long it was a favorite for so long but I
have moved on from you yes I have okay
so I'm going to talk about highlighters
and then I'm going to jump into lip
products to end this video so lips will
be left if I can think of one highlight
that was like ultimate highlight on
YouTube for so long I have to give that
to the mary-lou manizer by the balm this
one right here I have this little trio
of the mary lou manizer at the cindy lou
manizer and the betty loumanizer i did
purchase a full-size mary loumanizer but
mine ended up breaking so I just stick
to this little palette that I have I
don't feel like purchasing a brand new
mary lou manizer when you know i have it
right here you know what I mean everyone
was raving about the mary lou manizer
like saying it was the most intense
highlight ever I feel like the mary lou
manizer is the highlight that got
everyone going it was a start it was the
start of something beautiful and for a
good reason it's such a beautiful like
vanilla shade looks really really glowy
on the cheeks buttery formula the mary
lou manizer by the balm is the ball now
this one doesn't
because this is actually a present I got
for Christmas so does that count
in my defense I had wanted it so bad for
Christmas because I heard everyone talk
about it
so YouTube made me put it on my
Christmas list and that is the mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade soft
and gentle now this is a brand new one
not brand new I got it like seven six
months ago this is their newer packaging
they used to not have this packaging I
used up my soft and gentle pretty much
like it had been so used that there was
like this weird film over it so I ended
up tossing that and getting a new one
this is the highlight I'm wearing on my
cheeks today was the first highlight I
had ever put on my face I thought that I
had like made it I was like ah I barely
used this highlight now I have so many
highlights I love more than this I
actually think that I heard people talk
about this before I heard people talk
about the mary-lou manizer it was
definitely like a cult favorite everyone
was talking about soft and gentle for a
point and now no one talks about Mac
soft and gentle literally no one I hear
zero about soft easil and then the last
highlight that I bought because everyone
was raving about it on YouTube was the
Becca shimmering skin protector in the
shade opal I purchased opal and
moonstone myself before I started
getting PR from Becca but opal was the
one everyone was raving about I just had
to get my hands on it and I remember
walking into Sephora because Becca
wasn't super known back in the day like
when I started watching YouTube so when
I heard all the rave and the fuss about
opal and I walked into my Sephora and I
saw it there for the first time like a
new Becca display and nearly peed my
pants I was like oh my gosh do you guys
have opal because I need it right now
and personally I feel like opal is a
little bit too dark for my skin tone you
can kind of see it on my face like if I
were to apply this you would kind of see
a little bit of a stripe happening when
I do have a self-tan on it is really
really beautiful but when I am my
natural like skin color it's a little
bit too dark okay let's talk about some
lip products YouTube made by if I can
think of one lip product that I bought
just because YouTube was raving about it
it has to be Kat Von D Lolita I know
everyone has been mention
this in this type of video but it's
because it's true this is a mini size
because I have no idea where my
full-size Lolita is but I remember that
it was sold out for so long everyone at
one point on YouTube was raving about
Lolita and I feel like it's still a lip
color that everyone is talking about
it's the color I'm wearing on my lips
today I know there's been like different
formulations and different colors like
the original Lolita and then the second
batch I don't know it's just Lolita is
one of those colors that looks so
different on everyone I think it's a
stunning liquid lipstick I don't love
the formula Lolita can look a little bit
patchy on my lips I do have to go over
it two or three times but I love the
color so much I look past that
definitely this was so hyped on YouTube
that it just it made me want it so much
more and the same goes for the Stila all
day liquid lipstick in patina there was
a point where I could not get my hands
on this for months it was sold out just
like Lolita like constantly sold out
when liquid lipsticks were first
introduced to like the beauty community
like when everyone started raving about
liquid lipsticks you know like that wave
was coming in it was like Lolita and
patina
olia and petite Lolita empty if you
weren't raving about Lolita you were
raving about patina it's like everyone I
used to love the Stila liquid lipsticks
they were my favorite formula ever until
I got introduced to a ton of other
brands and now they're definitely not my
favorite formula they're a little bit
drying a little bit crumbly on the lips
but this one I don't have any problems
with it's a really really really
stunning color
okay so Mac stone lip liner was so hard
to get along with Saur Saur world and
stone I think we're like the hyped lip
liners on YouTube I cannot find my world
and I cannot find my sore lip liner
anywhere I don't know where they went
I don't know who took them and I
definitely purchased them because
everyone was raving about them I have
used this stone lip liner maybe like
twice in my life I don't love the Mac
lip liners at least not the wooden ones
I really really really love their pro
long wear lip liners I think they're
really creamy they last all day they
don't tug at my lips I don't know
they're they're wooden lip liners are
not that great and everyone raves about
them and I don't know why because
they're like drying and they're just not
the best I do not think these are worth
the money at all but still you to me
everybody okay and then the last two
products I'm going to be talking about
today one is the lipstick and one is the
lip gloss the buxom White Russian lip
gloss was like everyone's favorite lip
gloss for a while the first person I
heard talked about it was Nicole
Guerrero I was hearing so many people
talk about white brushin not buxom lip
glosses in general like White Russians
specifically and I had purchased this
when I first started my channel I
remember I had just recently started my
channel when I bought this and it was
the only lip gloss I wore like for a
month still to this day right Russian is
probably my favorite lip gloss of all
time if I can get rid of every single
lip gloss I own and only keep one buxom
joy Russian so my last item for the
video today is a MAC lipstick my very
first video on YouTube was actually my
MAC lipstick collection I'm pretty sure
that was my first video ever it's
probably the most embarrassing video on
YouTube because like halfway through the
video it gets super dark you cannot see
the lipsticks on my lips yet I posted it
anyway I don't know why but I did
I'm mature now I don't really care for
my lipsticks anymore like they smell
really great they're really creamy but
there's ton of other brands out there
that make really great lipsticks also
but Mac candy yum-yum
was a lipstick that everyone was
obsessed with everyone it was either
this or Mac angel Kim Kardashian wore
Mac angel like in a picture or something
like that and then people on YouTube
when balls crazy and everyone was
talking about Mac angel but when Mac
candy yum-yum came out everyone I saw
this on everyone
I feel like this hot pink lip was really
really really in style before the whole
brown lip came into trend everyone was
into these pinks and don't tell me no I
became obsessed with this color I wore
it all the time I would wear to like
birthday parties a picnic on the beach
like I don't care I was wearing this hot
pink lip everywhere I went
so I guys that
this video there are a ton of other
products I purchased because everyone
was raving about them on YouTube I still
do that
till this day if something is super
overhyped oh my gosh I'm not done I'm
not done
I've thought about this crap I found
this underneath my sink and I was like
ah I have to include that I have to
include that this is from the brand new
me and this is it doesn't have a name
it's just a what do you call these
crimper one of these things you go like
this and you go like this and you go
like this and then it crimps your hair
like super 90s yes okay everyone at a
point was talking about this do you
remember when everyone was talking about
new me it was like oh my gosh I love
newbie new Me's the best gnome is that
yeah where's know me now huh nobody
talks about know me anymore just saying
I'm someone personally I'm sorry I just
I never felt it to the new me hype I
mean obviously I did once but it was
just a brand I always thought was insane
they would charge you like $300 for a
curling one but then they gave you a
discount code that took off like $200
they would give you like the craziest
discount codes like save $200 on a $300
one and that always made me question it
like is it really $300 then or are you
just pretending you're making me save so
much money but I had seen this specific
wand going around a lot and it looked so
beautiful people were like crimping
their hair it just looked stunning but I
went and I purchased it this is good
while it is really really bad so the
cool thing about this one is that it's
supposed to be a like it has a lock
button here and it's supposed to be a
curling wand and a crimper so it's like
a two-in-one wand so even though these
were super pricey I thought okay that's
worth my money because I get to in one
you know I get to curl my hair and crimp
my hair what could be better this sucks
the crimper is awesome like you can
crimp your hair with it I still use this
from time to time because it does a good
job of crimping your hair and I think
the look is really cool super 90s I love
it
but this does not curl your hair like
this part this sucks
you have to have like super thin hair
and
and then you have to like okay you have
to use like this much here like this
much and then you have to leave your
hair there for like a 17 hours more or
less and then once you let it go you'll
get like a baby wave I was so
disappointed the first time I tried to
curl my hair with this I was so mad I
was like I'm done with this this is
something that was so hyped on YouTube
and in my personal opinion was 100% not
worth the freaking hype maybe I got a
crappy one but um now I'm officially
done these were products that I
purchased because everyone was talking
about them on YouTube and for the most
part they turned out to be really really
great products leave me a comment down
below letting me know what you purchased
because everyone was talking about it on
YouTube whether it was like years ago or
recently let me know and also let me
know if it ended up being worth your
money or not did you hate it did you
love it was it worth the hype was it not
but yeah that completes this video thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye I feel
like a lot of oh I feel like a lot as a
nurse foundation called of the mary-lou
manizer was that even English if you
weren't raving about Lolita you were
wavering about oh hold on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
