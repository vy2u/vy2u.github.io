tutorial on DS loot okay
this look is actually inspired by
Sandhya she wore a similar similar look
to the MTV movie and TV awards and when
I saw her I nearly fainted she looked so
good her hair her makeup and her dress
like they all tied together so well she
looked in my opinion she looked the best
I mean everybody looks good but to me
she looked the best I think she looked
awesome and I fell in love with her
makeup and I really wanted to do
something inspired by it I was looking
at a lot of photos online and most of
them she had her eyes open
so I couldn't really tell exactly what
was on her eyes but I came across this
photo like I have like 100 pictures of
her in my school I came across this
photo where she's like blowing a kiss
and her eyes are closed and her eyes are
green but they're kind of like a golden
green so that really was the inspiration
I took to create this look and I saw in
the covergirl Instagram that they used
this palette and I'm assuming they used
this green shade and this is the thing I
was telling you guys in my last video
that I had to order because I didn't
have this and I wanted to use this
because I saw that they used it but this
screen I gotta be honest it's not my
favorite it's kind of chunky and it has
a lot of Fallout and it's not my
favorite green eyeshadow it definitely
works you could use it I mean they use
it on zendaya and it looked fabulous but
I don't know what they use in
conjunction maybe they use fix+ I don't
know what they did I wish I knew I wish
I know everything that they used but I
still wanted to do a look inspired by it
so this is not exactly like her look
this is just inspired by it so it's not
exactly the same I just loved how the
golden green looked with like the rosy
cheeks and the rosy pink lip I just
thought it looked so beautiful her skin
was very glowy very dewy at least in the
photos maybe it was the flash or
something but her skin just looked so
delete and beautiful like look at that
like look at that dewy beautifulness I
loved it so iris this intro is way too
long if you want to see how to get this
and they inspired makeup tutorial then
just keep watching okay so I'm actually
going to start off with her eyebrows
because India's eyebrows looked fabulous
that night well
has amazing eyebrows to begin with I
just wanted to make them a little bit
more like hers and tried to brush
upwards with my eyebrow pencil this is
the benefit precisely my brow
she has like really sick amazing like
feathery looking brows and all the
photos I saw so I tried to make them as
thick as hers and as feathery as hers
but you know we have completely
different eyebrows but I tried my best I
love her brows it looks awesome and then
to set them and make them look extra
feathery I took my Jalan Chi mr. brow
room to really put them up and give them
that feathery look to prime my eyes I'm
going to use my Urban Decay primer
potion in enigma and I'm going to put
that on my entire lid then i'm going to
take my visor palette this is the matte
neutrals one and i'm going to take this
shade right here just to set down that
primer and so it's not sticky going back
into the visor palette i'm going to take
this shade and i'm going to use this in
my crease i couldn't really tell so much
in the photo but then they seem to have
kind of like a warm color in her crease
and so i'm using this as my transition
shade transition shade so all the colors
blend nicely on top and i'm going to
take this brown and i'm going to focus
this on the outer corners just to add a
little bit of depth to the look for the
main all-over lid shade i'm going to
take this one from tarte it is their tar
Dias metallic shadow and this is the
shade jaded and i'm just going to apply
this to my entire lid
now I'm going to go into the CoverGirl's
true naked jewels palette and I'm going
to take the green shade and I'm going to
apply it on top of that jaded eyeshadow
this one is a little chunky and kind of
has a lot of Fallout it's a little
sparkly but I layered them Oh in the
photo I noticed that she had kind of
like a golden hue to the green eyeshadow
so I took the gold color in the
covergirl palette and I just applied
that right on top of the green and then
I dragged this into my crease and I'm
applying this gold color in my crease
and I know that may seem weird but
zendaya had like a beautiful shimmery
gold shade in her crease like you could
tell when her eyes are open and she has
like a sheen in her crease and it's like
really pretty and gold and yet I did
that and then I apply some Brown some
more Brown to the outer corner and now
I'm just retouching with the jaded
eyeshadow just in case some of it got
blended away from all the blending and
then I'm just taking some more of that
gold into my crease
she didn't really have like an intense
shimmery Bravo and highlight so I'm just
taking the white from the visor pallet
just to highlight my brow bone just a
little bit and then to tightline I'm
going to take the Anastacio darkside
eyeliner and for eyeliner like for
liquid liner I'm taking my Tom Ford one
just because it's so expensive and I
bought it and I haven't used it in
months and I feel like I need to use it
you know because I mean deficits so I'm
just using this to create a wing she had
like a really pretty not too thick but
not too thin either like a nice and nice
wing so to start on my face before I
finish up my eyes I just applied some
moisturizer her skin was really dewy and
pretty so I applied the Kiehl's ultra
facial moisturizer as a base and then I
went in with my number 7 list and
luminate foundation I love this
foundation because I haven't shared a
medium coverage but it does leave your
skin nice and dewy to balance everything
out to add a little bit more coverage I
decided to go in with a heart shape tape
concealer and I had swiped it under my
eye and I realized that was way too much
for my eyes so I tried to drag it to the
other eye yeah I'm a little bit of a
disaster but you do not need
much product with this concealer it has
a lot of coverage and a little goes a
long way and I also use this to add more
coverage to the rest of my face and
between my brows and on my chin just so
it's nice and highlighted and everything
balances out to set my concealer I'm
going to use my NYC smooth skin loose
translucent setting powder I'm only
going to use this powder underneath my
eyes and anywhere I put down the
concealer because for the rest of my
face I want to use a different powder I
know that's a little extra but the
powders are different okay
so hope you outer I'm going to use is
the cohesion don't manifest no my funky
natural lighting powder I'm using this
powder to set the rest of my face
because I still want my face to have a
little bit of a sheen to it and this
powder is not illuminating but it has a
little bit of a sheen to it and it
doesn't matter Phi the skin too much so
I really like that I used to not like it
but I'm starting to really like it so I
just applied some black eyeliner to my
waterline and then for underneath the
lashes she didn't have like a super
intense smoky lower lash line so I just
applied some brown eyeshadow and then I
went back in with the jaded shadow by
Tarte and I just smudged that right
there and for my inner corners I took
the Oprah highlight in the shade Rodeo
Drive and I just pop that on my inner
corners because she had a really pretty
golden in her corner highlight and then
I popped on some falsies this is the
kiss Amalia lashes her lashes I could
tell she was wearing falsies but they
weren't like crazy dramatic or too long
so I just won with these and to contour
my face I'm using the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer I'm just contouring with
this a little bit and then I'm going in
with a different bronzer to warm up the
skin and I'm going in with system this
is the elsi cosmetics bronzer in the
shade light this is brand new to me and
I've been using it recently and I really
like it very it's not very warm but it's
pretty warm for me and I like it to kind
of warm up the skin and give you kind of
like a sunkissed glow even though it's
matte I don't know I really like it so
far to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones I'm going to take my essence
pure nude highlighter and
highlights and then I want to take my
dewy skin one step further so I took a
stippling brush and I dipped it into
this highlight and I pretty much put
this highlight everywhere it's a very
buildable highlight and it's subtle so I
mean it's okay to do this sometimes so I
just put this all over my face to create
more of a dewy complexion and she had a
really pretty rosy blush on so I went in
with the Milani powder brush powder
blush in the shade romantic rose and she
had I noticed her blush a lot for some
reason that's the first thing I noticed
her cheeks looks so flushed and
beautiful so I applied more blush than I
normally do because you know for some
reason I just don't think blush looks
that good on me but I went in with a
rosier cheek to come out when I went
back in with the essence highlighter
just to intensify it a little bit and
then I just popped on the Rodeo Drive
highlight by Ofra just right at the top
for a little bit more umph and then I
use the Milani make it last setting
spray just to set everything down and
that finishes the face yeah that's
pretty much it for the lips I decided to
do a tulip combo just to get the perfect
color this is the MAC lipstick in velvet
teddy but I thought it was a little bit
like too dark too rosy so I went in with
the Tarte Color Splash lipstick in the
shade of beach babe and this kind of
toned it down a little bit and I think
it ties really nicely with the blush so
