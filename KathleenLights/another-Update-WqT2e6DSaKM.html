if the a/c is too loud so I'm in the car
because I need to film this update video
for you guys that I promised I would
film and I can't film anywhere else but
my car because there's a lot of things
going on inside of this house that's why
I'm sorry if this is bothering you but
like I'm in my car and I don't know I
don't even know what that bag is a bag
by the way I got some questions on
Twitter the other day for some reason
asking what car drive I Drive a Nissan
Sentra
and I don't know if it's because I'm
used to Danny's truck and Danny driving
me around but I'm scared to drive in
this car now I've always had a fear of
driving it's always been an issue for me
like I have like anxiety from the moment
I get in the car and I put on my seat
belt to the moment I reach my reach my
destination and take off my seat belt I
have anxiety the entire time driving
really really really scares me that's
why I don't really like to be the one
who drives places I don't mind driving
alone like I'm not so much afraid when
I'm by myself but when I have someone
else's life in my hands it freaks me out
what wow that's not what this video is
about anyway oh my point was that I'm
thinking of getting a bigger car I don't
know not a van but like just a bigger
car because I feel a little bit too
scared in this one this video is not
about this but anyway for those of you
asking it recently I Drive a Nissan
Sentra anyway so I promise you guys that
I would do an update video I was
supposed to go up yesterday but I
couldn't film it there were so many
things going on I couldn't film it so
I'm going to try to film it edit it and
post it today it might go up tonight
today's Sunday so if you guys saw my
life of the ish video I kind of told you
guys certain things
basically I just told you guys I
couldn't record in the entire month of
October because so many things were
happening and there were a lot of
changes in my life and that I would
update you in another video and that
video is this one so I really
contemplated even filming this video
because it has a lot to do with Danny
Oh before I get into it I will be
disabling the comments in this video do
not get offended it's just I know you
guys are always supportive and always
have my back and leave me the sweetest
comments that make me feel better always
I love you guys you guys are all nice
but I have a feeling I'm gonna get
overwhelmed reading the comments in this
video and I know that may sound weird
but lately my anxiety has been through
the roof and like my OCD has been
triggered a ton so forgive me if you
don't understand why I'm disabling the
comments in this video even though I
don't know what's going to be commented
but I just have a feeling that I'm going
to get really overwhelmed reading it
like really emotional I know that seems
strange but if you guys want to talk to
me about this video follow me on twitter
it's kathleenlights 1 I will have my
Twitter name down below I always do but
follow me on Twitter I interact more
with people there because it's just
easier to reply through Twitter
anyway I contemplated filming this video
at all because Danny likes to keep his
life very very very private like you
guys see him in my vlogs and I've done
videos with him like tag videos but
whenever has anything to do with his
personal life he doesn't like me talking
about it at all at all he likes to keep
his life out of my beauty videos which
makes perfect sense like that's his life
I shared my life with you guys and he's
part of my life but we just talk about
beauty mainly on my channel and stuff so
he's a very private person and this has
to do with his job this video has to do
with his job so I didn't really I didn't
know if I should talk about it
but he didn't care he was like sure talk
about it it makes sense because in order
for you guys to understand what's going
on I have to tell you guys Danny got out
of the Navy and it was a really really
really hard decision his contract was up
and he is his intention like his
intention to 100% war to re-enlist like
Danny loves the Navy his life is the
Navy he joined the Navy in a really dark
time in his life and it just made him a
better person it changed his life
completely and it was a very hard
decision he made
like there were tears it was really
really hard because he's he loved his
job obsessed with his job he's a CBL he
was he was a CV for those of you who
don't know Seabees are like the builders
of the Navy and he did that before the
Navy as well he was like a roofer or
something something to do with building
and then he joined the Navy he's a
builder he made the decision to get out
of the Navy and now he is working on
doing his general contracting business
like if you don't know what a general
contractor is I barely know what a
general contractors but that is the
business he's doing he wants to have
like his own business of general
contracting so that is what we're doing
right now he also manages like all my my
emails and stuff like with companies if
companies reach out to me or anything in
my emails Danny takes care of that
because I'm a mess and I'm like I'm so
disorganized when it comes to that but
yeah anyway he won he's doing general
contracting now he's like in the process
so it was really hard for him to decide
to do it but for those of you who didn't
know I lived in Key West this whole time
that I have been filming in my newest
Beauty room I've been in Key West I
lived in Mississippi for like four years
and then he got recession to Key West
and I was just telling you guys that I
was back in Miami because it was just
easier to say than Key West because a
lot of people don't know what the hell
Key West is and it is like three hours
south of Miami so that's where I've been
this whole time you guys have been
noticing oh my god it's raining you guys
have been telling me that I just seemed
really sad in recent videos and that I'm
not myself and that's because I've just
been so stressed after you know the
decision was made like okay he's getting
out of the Navy our lives are changing
forever
I don't deal well with change I mean I I
accept change I like it I think it's
necessary for us to go through changes
in life just to evolve and become better
people and it's just I think change is
necessary but it's really hard for me
to conform to change so when that
decision was made it's like our worlds
were a little bit rocked because if you
guys know I just moved into that house
in Key West eight months ago you guys
were there when I was moving from
Mississippi to Key West and like the
whole process I was only there for eight
months when all of a sudden okay Danny's
getting out of the Navy and now we have
to move again my camera just told me
that the temperature was too high and I
needed to cool it off so I'm like
holding it in front of my AC vent so
this might be a little bit wobbly for a
second but anyway so this dream was to
be a general contractor anyways so we
saw the opportunity and now we're able
to live close to our families um which
is great I'm not sad about that at all
that's not what's giving me anxiety my
issue is we bought a house I mean about
this house months ago right because we
knew that this was happening we knew
that we were gonna have to move out of
base so we bought this house and it was
supposed to be done like the first week
of October like this week it was
supposed to be done this week and we
were like oh perfect it was right you
know it was gonna happen at the perfect
time but I guess because it's hurricane
season a lot of things you know life
life happens that they're not done and
who it's really bright outside they're
not done and they will look now all of a
sudden they won't be done until
mid-november which I had pre-recorded
videos all of October just in case but
now and they're not going to be done
till mid-november
so we had to put all of our stuff in
storage everything we own all of our
stuff in storage for a month and a half
just to take them out of storage and
move again so basically we moved like a
couple days ago to just move again like
put it all in storage and just do the
whole process all over again and if you
guys have moved before you know how
stressful it is my camera heated up
again anyway I have moved like four
times
in the past like four years because of
the military and stuff so if you guys if
you guys go through that you know how
stressful it is to constantly move your
entire home and so I've just been really
stressed out because
it's like I have to do it twice it's
like I have to do it all over again all
my stuff is in storage and my happy
place is YouTube my happy place is my
beauty room well it's my beauty room and
I sit there and I film videos and my
anxiety goes away my stress goes away my
panic attacks they go away and like for
a couple of hours I'm just in peace
that's why I love filming that's why I
post three times a week for you guys
it's just it's my meditation basically
so the fact that I cannot do this till
mid-november
really really like triggers something
inside of me I'm just really upset about
that but we're staying at Danny's
father's house because they he has a
spare room and I got a little corner to
myself I did bring my lights I didn't
take my lights into storage or my camera
so I kind of created a little corner in
the room to film videos and I kind of
decorated it a little bit it's a little
bit cheesy and stuff so I have that
little corner and I will be filming
videos there while I can if I can't like
when I can I mean because it's a house
full of people so whenever someone is
not home or something I'm gonna try to
film and that's what that brings me to
my next comment I said that I could only
post videos twice a week this month and
that's still true but since I found a
little filming area I'm gonna be
throwing in extra videos this month in
it on my channel and the same goes till
mid-november but since you guys know now
I will be taking you to a through the
process I'm gonna vlog like our home and
stuff the reason why I'm sure you guys
are really confused it won't be ready is
because the house is being built right
now our house is being built it's not a
house that you know someone owned and we
bought it was just like it was like
cheaper to do like pre construction or
whatever I I actually don't know
anything about that actually I don't
know so ignore everything I just said
but anyways it's because the house is
being built at the moment and it won't
be done till mid-november but I will
vlog the whole experience and the second
my house is ready the first thing my
first priority is putting up my beauty
room and doing all of that so I will
take you through that and then you know
just be think of the future I will do a
makeup collection in a room tour my
beauty room tour and all that stuff with
my new setup
so yes a lot of you guys guessed that I
was moving and you guys were absolutely
right so it's just it's stressing me out
because I have to stay in a house that's
not mine for a month and a half and you
know film when no one is around or when
someone is out of the house and it's
just my happy place is gone but I'm
happy because I'm officially back and
Danny could be with his family and I
could be with my family or our family
because you know it's our whole family
so that is what it has been going on and
if you guys wanna talk to me head on
over to Twitter but thank you guys even
though the comments are disabled in this
video I feel I feel your love all the
time because you guys are always
tweeting me like hey whatever you're
going through don't worry you'll get
through it so I feel the love that you
guys give me and I just want to say
thank you so much please bear with me
that this is what's going on right now
I'm in the process of moving and I've
never heard of anybody that's in the
process of moving for two months but
that's what's going on right now it's
just gonna be a long process waiting for
this home and then getting my house
ready once I move in unpacking taking
everything out of storage doing the
whole thing it's going to be a process
but I'm going to try my best to film as
much as I can in my little corner that
I've created I will show you guys my
little corner very soon because I'm
going to film a video like tomorrow or
something I don't know when I'm gonna
put put it up I don't know what I'm
gonna put it up and I'm gonna film it
tomorrow but yeah I just wanted to
update you guys now you guys know what
the situation is the only reason I
couldn't talk about it is because Danny
didn't want me to talk about it until he
was officially out of the Navy for those
of you who were wondering why I didn't
want to talk about it but yes that's
what's going on I love you guys and I
will see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
