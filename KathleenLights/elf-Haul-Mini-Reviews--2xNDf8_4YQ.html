slash review type of video I tweeted
about a week ago that the studio line
from Elle was 50% off on their website
so mama went a little crazy there have
been so many things from ELF that I
really wanted to try but I didn't feel
like ordering online and paying for
shipping and yada yada yada so when I
saw that the studio line was 50% off I
was like here's your chance which is
awesome because the studio line is the
line I prefer from ELF so yeah let's
just hop it oh by the way everything on
my face today is elf I use all these
products will not not all these products
on my face today but all the products
that are my face are using these
products so that's why it's kind of like
a review as well since I did use them on
my face today so it's kind of like a
first impressions kind of review I'm
going to be showing you everything and
swatching everything and telling you my
thoughts on everything so yeah the only
thing that isn't elf on my face is my
mascara and my under-eye concealer but
everything else is elf so I picked up
three brushes from elf
the first thing I picked up is the
kabuki face brush I have been wanting to
try this forever this retails for $6 but
since I was 50% off I got it for three
bucks and I did use it today to set my
foundation and I put everything back
into the packaging so you could see what
it looks like in the packaging you know
but I did use this today to set my
foundation with my MSF natural oh yeah
that's another thing that's not elf but
just those three things and I love this
thing like I don't know what took me so
long to buy it this just sets my
foundation so amazingly like it's so
soft it's like it is it's like a bunnies
little little butt like a little bunny
butt or tail not butt so yeah I really
really love this I definitely recommend
it even if you get it for the full six
dollars it's amazing
I pay more than $6 for this cuz I love
it I also got this pointed foundation
brush I had never seen this brush before
at Target or on the website but my
friend ordered some stuff off of the
website too and this is one of the
things she got so I saw it the other day
and I was like oh my god I want it it
reminds me a lot of the Sigma um like
the sigmax collection the pointed one
that a lot of people like to use to
blend out their concealer it's not a
dupe the bristles feel completely
different but it is a similar shape
that's on trend say and I use it today
to blend out my under-eye concealer and
I really really like it I think it
blends out your under-eye concealer
pretty nicely actually like I really
liked it so if you've been wanting to
get that Sigma one but you don't want to
pay the money or anything just try this
out as three dollars like I said it's
not a dupe for that one but I mean it
gets the job done I really like it and
then the brush that I was mostly
surprised with was this complexion brush
I know they sell this one at Target but
I had never picked it up and I really
really like this brush I used it today
to put on my my ron's err I used it all
over my face and I really liked it
because I think it's perfect to contour
your face to get a natural contour since
it goes since it's like you know tapered
like this you just get right up in there
and it blends out your bronzer
beautifully I used it today like I said
and I'm so impressed with this brush it
blended out my bronzer like heavenly
really liked it I got all of their bait
highlighters there's only three of them
this is what they look like this one is
called blush gems and it is just a kind
of like a bronzy type of highlight there
is a little bit of pink to it but not
but not that much it's a really really
pretty highlight I really like this one
this one is blush gems this one is
called pink diamond and it is exactly
that it's very very very pink as you can
see I'm not into pink highlights at all
so I don't know how I'm going to be
using this one but when I do swatch it
on my hand
a beautiful pink so maybe I'll put this
like on top of like a matte pink blush
to just give it a little bit of a glow
but this one's really pretty and then
this one is my favorite one this one is
moonlight pearls and it is just an ivory
kind of highlight reminds me a lot of
the the bombs mary lou manizer it has
that type of like light golden ivory
color it is absolutely beautiful I'm
obsessed with it and I think that these
baked highlighters are great especially
for the price because there is not a lot
of glitter in them I don't know I
explained it once you rub your finger
over the top you're like oh this isn't
really that pigmented but when you you
know swatch it on your hand it gives a
beautiful Sheen and that's what I love
about it because I hate glitter I like
highlights they give off a sheen like
that wet look and this definitely does
that also keep in mind that you can use
this way if you want a crazy crazy like
I'm talking crazy intense highlight wet
then and and it'll be very intense so
yeah I give these a thumbs up I got the
elf daily moisture stick and the only
reason I got this is because I've heard
Emily in a while rave about this for a
while now
and it is just like pretty much exactly
what it is it's a moisture stick and it
says it's enriched with antioxidants and
anti-aging ingredients grape cocoa shake
avocado and macadamia aloe and chamomile
chamomile is my life I love anything
that has chamomile in it so I decided to
pick it up it just like this and then
pop this little sucker off and it looks
like a giant chapstick basically and I
use this underneath my makeup today in
certain areas where foundation tends to
cake me up a little bit so I used it
around my nose and in between my
forehead a little bit underneath my eyes
and actually really like it has a
cooling effect and it's really nice so
yeah I mean it's cool I have to see one
of the things I could possibly use this
for but so far I mean it's cool I got
the elf makeup remover cleansing cloths
I've never tried them before me smell
them
hello no way I hope they don't bring my
eyes cuz that is my biggest pet peeve
with makeup removers so I mean that's
that the next thing I got was the thing
that I was most excited for out of
everything that I got and it is the elf
acne fighting foundation flawless
coverage formula that helps prevent and
treat acne I don't know about that I'm
always extremely skeptical when it comes
to foundations that claim to improve
acne I don't know but yeah I got mine in
the color buff and this is what the what
it looks like the packaging reminds me a
lot of Clinique packaging and the makeup
forever matte moment plus it reminds me
a lot of that but I honestly think that
this is a dupe or at least they're
trying to imitate a clinic foundation
that's in this exact bottle and it's
also an acne fighting foundation from
Clinique I'm not sure I could be
completely wrong but yeah the color
match is pretty good I winged it on the
website I was like okay I guess I'm buff
and it's pretty good it's just like a
hair a hair too dark for me but now
going into spring and summer it's
probably gonna be like an exact match I
am wearing this on my face right now
actually the only thing that I'm like oh
about is the fact that it has witch
hazel in it which is great for oily skin
but it's not right for people with dry
skin like me it didn't cake up my face
all that much actually I did use this
underneath it and I didn't really get
cakiness at all use the very thin layer
all over my face and it didn't really
cake up um I don't know the coverage is
really good like it has a lot of
coverage I literally used just a thin
thin layer and buffed it all over my
face and it gave me like pretty good
coverage I think this would be amazing
for oily skin or normal skin for me it
works pretty well and I have dry skin
but I did have moisturizer on before so
if you want to buy this and you have dry
skin I would just advise you to
moisturize if you want me to go more in
depth with this foundation like a whole
foundation review and me wear it
throughout the day and stuff like that
let me know in the comments below and
I'll do a whole review on that
picked up the HD under eye setting
powder this is what I use to set my
under eye concealer today and it's good
the only thing I don't like is the
glitter there's glitter in this product
what why is there glitter in this
product why there's like literally
specks of glitter all over this thing
and it sucks because it feels really
really nice I just wish that it didn't
have the glitters in it so what I did is
that I set my under eye concealer and I
kind of got another brush and kind of
brushed the glitters away and it seemed
to work I don't really see much glitter
underneath my eyes at all after I did
that so I'm going to continue to use it
because I think it's pretty good I
haven't used it for a full day so I
can't really tell you if it's amazing
but it's pretty good just else come on
take the clear out of this thing come on
I got five of their baked eyeshadows and
I gotta say I am obsessed with these I
am loving them they are really really
good I got five they're good I have this
one in passion purple which is a really
really nice intense deep purple it is
absolutely beautiful these are not
pigmented on their own as you can see
like once I rub my finger on it
so I definitely recommend using them wet
when you use them wet they are amazing
it gives off such a beautiful Sheen a
beautiful glow absolutely love them I
think they're worth the $3.00 they're
really inexpensive and they're worth it
so once you use them wet either a little
bit of water a little bit of fix plus
they will just glow on your eyes it
definitely recommend them they're
amazing I got that one this one is in
the color pixie it's a beautiful golden
eat pink and this one is absolutely
beautiful too once you wet it you see
the the gold really shining through the
pink I'm not explaining but I really
really love this one it's like a pretty
rose gold I also got this one which is
probably my favorite one this one is in
the shade toasted I've seen this one a
bunch of times at Target so literally
run ops Target right now and go buy this
because it is beautiful but out of all
the ones this one actually is very
pigmented without wetting it as you can
see it's like stew
pigment it and I didn't have to wet it
this is my favorite one it looks amazing
dry and even more amazing wet I also got
chocolate dreams which is a beautiful
deep chocolatey color just looks like
this it's so nice when you wet it but it
also is just like toasted in the sense
that you get pigment when it's dry so
it's super pigmented - I love it wet or
dry amazing I definitely recommend
I just dropped Osten but I definitely
recommend this one and toasted and then
the last one I got is called bronze
beauty this one is right up my alley it
is just an intense gold eyeshadow and
you guys know how I feel about I
actually recommend this one - this one
toasted and chocolate dreams amazing
this one is bronze beauty I don't know
if I said that already but it is also
pretty pregnant in once once you swatch
it not as pigmented as the other two but
what this looks heavenly toasted
chocolate dreams and bronze Beauty are
what I'm wearing on my eyes right now
and nothing else
I have toasted all over my lid chocolate
dreams in the outer V and in my crease
and then I have this beautiful gold one
underneath my lash line I'm just
obsessed with these I got one of their
matte lip colors this is in the color
coral it's what's on my lips right now
these are really really good I'm gonna
go and pick up some more because I only
bought one of them but I'm really
impressed the only thing I will say is
that you really need to exfoliate your
lips before you put this on and use a
like a base like a chapstick or an EOS
lip balm or something because this kind
of sinks into your fine lines a lot I
was like oh so I had to go and put
chapstick underneath and exfoliate my
lips a little bit but once I did that
it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful
color so I recommend them just as
foliate girl I picked up one of their
baked blushes in peachy chi-chi's and
it's just a really really light shimmery
not shimmery yea shimmery peach color um
it's two shimmering for me to wear as
like a blush and then a highlight
this is what's on my cheeks right now as
a highlight because there's not too much
pigment coming off of this thing I don't
know I mean it is pigmented but honestly
it's not too pigmented for for me to
wear it as a blush personally so I did
use this as a highlight and it does give
a really pretty peachy glow so it kind
of doubles up as both of them blush and
highlight more highlight but you can get
away with it using as a blush and I
think this would look amazing in the
summer I'm just like I can't wait for
the spring and summer because I think
this would look fabulous I picked up the
eyebrow kit from ELF and all the other
ones were sold out except medium and
yeah it's too dark for me it's what's on
my eyebrows right now how many goes to
my eyebrows tomorrow so they're looking
a little wonky but yeah this is what it
looks like this is actually an amazing
product I'm so impressed
it comes with a wax and a powder again
this is way too dark for me as you can
see like what waited are the wax really
keeps my eyebrows in place and the
powder is just so easy to blend it's
amazing definitely check this out it's
worth every penny and it's three dollars
I got a cream eyeliner in the shade
copper I really like the elf cream
liners I used to use the black one all
the time back in the dizzle but I found
that the maybelline one is a lot better
so I switched over but I got this one in
copper just because I think it's a
beautiful bronze chocolatey color it's
what I use as a primer for my eyes today
I used it as a base and it was amazing
the eyeshadows looked great on top of it
and I also used it on my waterline and a
little bit on the top and I think it's
beautiful I think I'm gonna get some
more colors because they have really
nice colors I'm going to use them as
primers because it works really well and
it does increase on me personally so I'm
impressed and then the last three things
I picked up are the blush and bronzer
duos I have the original one that is
called Saint Lucia this is my original
one and I absolutely love this I use it
all the time so I figured I would get
the other ones that they have I picked
up this one this is in the color Antigua
and it's just like a darker bronzer with
a really really bright pink blush I
really really love this I haven't used
this one yet but i've swatched it and
it's like really intense I don't know I
think that this would be amazing in this
summer or for a deeper skin tones I
think that you would really like this
one because isn't tans and then I picked
up Turks and Caicos which is a lighter
bronzer and blush
well the bronzer is not light at all
actually
is it darker than my then Antigua let's
see oh yeah
I think that Turks and Caicos has a
darker bronzer an even darker bronzer
okay I think so are they're the same but
this is what it looks like I think it's
absolutely beautiful
this is the bronzer I'm using on my face
today and if you use a light hand then I
think that people with fair skin tone
can use it you just have to use a very
light hands because this pigmented it's
not pegs owns it and I love the blush
and this one it is a very bronzy blush
and then I got the contouring blush and
bronzing cream this is also in the color
st. Lucia just like the original one
only it's a cream and I am so impressed
with this so impressed with this my
friend has it and I was playing with it
at her house and I was super impressed
with the bronzer it's not like to
oranjee um and it's really really
pigmented and it's pretty easy to blend
I really liked it I haven't used the
blush so I don't know if it's good or
not actually don't own any cream blushes
so this is going to be fun I do want to
mention though that this bronzer applies
amazingly well with the elf small
stipple brush I bought this a couple
weeks ago and you just dip it into your
bronzer and apply it right to the
contours of your cheek and it blends out
beautifully and it blends it out
beautifully up here I recommend this
brush
100% okay so that is everything I got
off the elf website I know it's a lot
but everything in the studio line was
50% off so I jumped at the opportunity I
would say I'm pretty impressed with
everything I got there are a couple
little things here and there that I
wasn't too impressed with but overall I
think it was a thank you so much for
watching guys if you have any questions

subscribed please do so I would really
like that and um yeah I think that's it
I'll see you in my next video guys bye
