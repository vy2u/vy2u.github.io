because it is in Elko da well stuff
recently elves entire website was 50%
off so I took advantage and about things
this video is going to be a haul slash
kind of like a mini review type of video
on some of the products because I've
used them and I have my thoughts on them
you guys seem to really really like my
last huge alcohol where I had many
reviews and all that stuff I will link
that video down below if you haven't
seen it I got some good stuff in that
hall as well so I decided to go ahead
and pick up some of the things that I
have never picked up before and I've
never tried so let's jump right in okay
so I'm not going to go in any specific
order I'm just gonna okay so I picked up
three brushes that I've had my eye on
for a while now and I really like elf
but I don't like going to target or
certain places that they sell out
because I feel like they don't have all
the stuff I definitely recommend
ordering online if you're interested in
L they have I don't know they have
better variety or they have a bigger
selection I picked up the stipple brush
because I have the small stipple brush
and I loved it so much so I figured I
would just pick up the stuff the stipple
brush this is what it looks like it's
just you know like a basic stipple brush
I haven't actually used this one yet
but it seems like it does a really nice
job if it's anything like the small
stipple brush I'm going to love this
brush I picked up the flawless concealer
brush and I actually really really like
this I used it today to blend out my
under eye concealer and I really liked
it this is what it looks like it
basically just looks like a giant fluffy
crease brush and it blended out my
concealer really nicely the only thing I
will say is do not rub it like don't
blend it in like this definitely tap the
concealer end because this brush will
blend the concealer away I noticed like
in certain areas where I was blending it
instead of tapping it it did like blend
the
like I made it look patchy so I
definitely recommend tapping it in and
once you do like tap in the concealer
and blends flawlessly exactly how the
name says flawless concealer brush
I recommend it it's a three dollar brush
and it's high-quality you could
definitely tell it's high-quality brush
and then I picked up the small tapered
brush I have been wanting this for so
long but I have never seen it like a
target or anything like that
so I finally got it and I'm obsessed
with it
I used this to set my concealer today so
I just you know tapped it in my powder
and then I set my concealer with it and
it's amazing it's beautiful
Cornelius has been licking his paw for
like 30 minutes radius please Hernandez
please
so yeah it's just as good as the Sigma
one that people use to set their
concealer with it's so so great I'm
thinking of doing a video on my favorite
drugstore slash affordable makeup
brushes because I have a lot of really
good ones so let me know if you want to
see that look this is a great brush I
got three of the elf smudge pots this is
what they look like they're from the $1
line not the studio line and I ripped by
the way I put everything back in the
packaging this so you can see it in the
packaging these are actually really
really great especially for the price I
got brownie points which is this one
it's like a coppery bronze I got this
one in the shade of ocean bound and it
is a really really pretty
navy blue color and then I got this one
and got a glow and it's a really really
pale gold color I use this as kind of
like a primer underneath my eyes eye
primer like a base for my eyeshadows and
this one got a glow does you want to go
print it is
my desk today he's been sleeping on it
all morning but just I guess he's camera
shy guys he's camera shy anyway this one
in got a glow does apply a little bit
patchy but it's nothing that you can't
work with I really love these smudge
pots I'm definitely going to go back on
the website and buy like every single
color they're really great cream shadows
I got this makeup lock and seal and I
actually haven't used this yet I don't
know how much it looked interesting on
the website so I want to pick it up
you're supposed to put a few drops of
the lock and seal into the small pop
provided dampen the brush thoroughly
with the liquid and mix it with powder
or cream makeup and apply to the face
this is basically what the reason I
bought this is because I wanted to use
this to make powder eyeshadows into like
gel liners or like creamy eyeliners you
know I mean it comes with this little
thing this is the makeup lock and seal
you just pour it into this little jar
and then you just grab your brush dip it
into this pot and then dip it into any
powder eyeshadow and it's going to
intensify it a lot and make it kind of
liquidy so you could do like an eyeliner
look I'm not really excited to use this
I haven't used it yet
but I'm really excited I picked up the
elf eyelid primer this is a great
drugstore primer I've used that many
many times before and it's just it's
good stuff I really liked it so I ran
out of mine so I needed another one and
then I picked this up which I hadn't
seen before this is also in like their
$1.00 line or like their mineral line
pretty sure it's the $1 one this is the
elf glitter primer creates a
long-lasting hold for glitter eyeshadows
this is in the shade sheer it goes on
clear and I actually haven't used this
yet but I have applied it to my hand and
this stuff is really sticky so I'm
really excited to use this because this
would probably be like perfect for
pigments or the litter people have
compared this to two-faced glitter glue
so I'm really excited because this was a
dollar so I am so excited for this
because
it is so cheap and I'm sure this would
work really well with pigments and
glitter so I'll definitely keep you
posted but it's really sticky so I just
know what's going to work I picked up
another elf eyebrow kit I called this in
my last alcohol but I got the shade
medium last time and then I got light
this time because the shade medium was
just a little bit too dark for me so I
used to light today on my eyebrows and
don't judge my eyebrows my eyebrows are
so ratchet today guys okay the wonderful
woman who does my eyebrows is in Miami
which is where I was you know for the
last six months so since I left I
haven't been able to do my eyebrows it's
been like over a month and my eyebrows
were just looking crazy I'm trying to
like work with them myself but my
eyebrows look and insane so I got it in
the shade light and this one actually
works better for me I do like a bolder
brow but it's not too too too darker
Auburn ish this is what the powders look
like it has a nice brown color and then
I kind of like a cool toned brown shade
here and I usually like my eyebrow
powder to be a little bit more warmer
but it actually works really nicely and
this is actually a great crease color
you could use this as eyeshadow as well
and it's actually what I have in my
crease today and it's a great priests
color so I definitely recommend the elf
eyebrow kit they're really great it
comes with a gel and a powder and they
last all day so I got it in light I
picked up the elf BB cream this is a
broad spectrum SPF 20 and it is infused
with key anti-aging ingredients like
vitamin E jojoba aloe cucumber to
hydrate and nourish the skin I got mine
in the shade nude it is just a little
bit too orange for my skin tone but I
got it to work it as what I'm wearing on
my face today the color is a little bit
off I'm not going to lie but I really
love this BB cream it went on super
smooth not too hydrating where I looked
like incredibly dewy I do look a little
bit doing today because I sprayed the
crap on my face with fix+ but it isn't
too dewy it's kind of like a satin kind
of finish it's not dewy it's not matte
a nice finish and it actually really
liked it I was putting on like wow it
didn't cling on to dry patches
it was my stuff I really really like
this I picked up three more of the elf
baked eyeshadows I love elf baked
eyeshadows they're amazing when applied
with fix+ because they're baked so you
need to wet them but they're so so good
I bought five like in my last song and
then I picked up three that I had really
wanted I got bark which is a nice like
deep deep glittery brown it's really
nice it's what I have on my outer-v
right now and it's actually what I have
smudged underneath my lower lash line to
get like that smoky look I have bark
really good this is what it looks like
like I said it's a nice deep chocolatey
Brown so nice I picked up and chanted
it's a really really pretty intense gold
color this is definitely one that you
have to wet in order for it to show up
bark
I used it dry I didn't have to wet it to
use it and it actually showed up really
nicely but this one you definitely have
to wait it to show up which is fine
because it's a big die shadow I mean I
assume that's what I have to do but it's
a really nice intense gold color so
pretty I love golds I definitely
recommend Enchanted it's really nice and
then I picked up Burt plum and the
reason why I got burnt plums cuz a few
people in my last haul were like what
you didn't get burned pump that's the
best one you should about that one so I
went and I got it because you guys
recommended it and it is gorgeous it's a
beautiful beautiful purpley burgundy
brownie color it's so gorgeous this is
what it looks like it has like the
cranberry tones to it and it is so nice
and this is definitely one that you
don't need to use wet it works well dry
but when you wet it it's super intense
super amazing and beautiful I have it a
little bit in my crease today and a
little bit on my face nice okay and
that's for plum I picked up a baked
bronzer from the studio line and I'm
loving so much it is in the color Los
Cabos to bake hundreds that are you
ready to say that yet this is what it
looks like it comes in like the same
packaging as
the Bates eyeshadows but obviously
bigger and I'm obsessed with this
bronzer it is amazing you know how the
bronzers that come like in the duo's and
elf
they're all like very shimmery I think
they all have glitter in it could be
wrong but most of them have glitter in
it this is a completely matte bronzer
and because it is a baked product it's
not flat it's like a flat matte it has
like kind of like a glow to it but it's
still matte so it's perfect for
contouring I love the shade the most out
of the three that they sell online it's
Los Cabos Saint Lucia I think and some
other one this one was the nicest one
the one that was lighter than this was
probably way too light so I was scared
to buy it and this one is perfect
because it's not too orange not too cool
it's that perfect in-between shade
perfect for contouring I use it today to
bronze up my face at the contour I am
loving loving this bronzer picked up
four of their moisturizing lipsticks
this is what they look like right here
in the packaging and I really like these
I haven't tried out their moisturizing
lipsticks at all they want to have on my
lips right now is called the party in
the buff it is a nude but it's a very
peachy nude like it comes off peachy and
out of the four that I got this is the
only one that I'm like about it's a nice
nude I really love the color but on my
lips like it sinks into my fine lines
and it's not so great but I'm still
going to use it I'll find a way to like
put on a base or something so it doesn't
sink in the lines but I really do like
the warm color I also picked up pink
minks this one is so pretty it's just
like a nice everyday pink it's really
really pretty I love it it's like a rosy
really nice color I also picked up
weight pink it's um it's a little bit
more on the Mavi side as of as opposed
to pink makes wink pink pink minx this
one is a little bit more pink and this
one is a little bit more mauve and then
I decided to pick up a fun one and this
one is
the color flirty and fabulous and this
one is beautiful if you have been on the
hunt for like a nice bold hot pink
lipstick then definitely check out
flirty and fabulous if you're on a
budget this is a good one they're creamy
they're nice and even though they're
kind of like matte none of these are
shimmery or like glossy they're like
matte finishes their moisturizing matte
finishes they're not dry on the lips
they are definitely moisturizing
lipsticks their packaging is cute
because you can see the color on the
bottom I just have nothing bad to say
about these these are good quality for
the price okay so we are coming to the
end I just have two more things to show
you guys I picked up two of their
pressed mineral blushes this is what the
packaging looks like this is from the
mineral line and these are natural
mineral makeup no parabens no
preservatives no chemical dyes I picked
up two shades they have four shades in
total I picked up the ones that I saw
myself wearing the most because the
other two were a little bit darker I got
this one right here this is in the shade
sweet retreat this is the blush I'm
wearing on my cheeks right now this is
the color it's a nice warm pink perfect
for everyday this is the perfect
day-to-day blush and I'm not super super
crazy about their studio blushes like
they're alright I'm not crazy about them
I like these more their pigment is nice
it's not too powdery it goes on really
nicely like I said this is a blush I'm
wearing it's a nice warm pink and then I
got this one in the shade Cabo Cabana
which is just a really pretty coral
color like a warm peachy coral this
would look so pretty this time of year
like in the summertime it's really
really gorgeous on the cheeks kind of
just makes you look nice and bronzy in
awake like I really really love this
color it does have like little tiny
little X of gold in there but it doesn't
show up on the cheek so like very very
tiny little flecks you could barely see
them so they go on nice and matte both
of these are pretty much matte finishes
but oh my god I recommend these like
hardcore I recommend these these are
really really great
I know that they're coming out with
mineral bronzers I think they have like
five different shades and I'm pretty
sure they're all matte so I can't wait
for those to release because I'm gonna
make those up okay guys so that was
everything I've got in my ELF ha I hope
