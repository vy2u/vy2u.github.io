makeup tutorial on the look I'm wearing
right now this is the exact makeup look
I was wearing in my January favorites
video I posted that video a couple days
ago and I got so many requests to do a
makeup tutorial on the look I was
wearing so of course I had to do it for
you guys I am using the elf mad format
palette on my eyes
it's a drugstore palette extremely
affordable and really really beautiful
you can totally use this look for
Valentine's Day
I think it's perfect because it's really
soft and romantic the only thing bold is
the lip if you wanted to make it a
little bit more feminine no Porter is
not playing with that toy again no he's
not give it to me
like I was saying if you wanted to make
it a little bit more feminine you can go
in with like a pinky lips something a
little bit more rosy but I love how this
brown lip pairs with the eyes I think
it's a really pretty contrast I was
going to include like a second lip
option in this video something a little
bit more toned down and softly you know
what I just I just kept it this way I'm
just going to do a separate tutorial
specifically for Valentine's Day that's
going to be a little bit softer and a
little bit more fresh and simple so yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if
you create this makeup look tag me on
Twitter tag me on Instagram I would love
to see and if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching okay
so for this tutorial I'm going to kind
of start out with all my base products
first so I'm going to apply my Becca
first light priming filter as my primer
slash moisturizer very hydrating and
then I went in with my Perricone MD no
foundation foundation serum I love this
but as you can see it is a little bit
too dark for me it just comes in one
shade which totally sucks that's so
weird but I do make it work with some
concealer and I end up bronzing my neck
later on but I'm just applying this to
my entire face I love the finish it's
very natural with light coverage but I
love how it looks you could load it up
to medium then I'm going to take my
concealer this is the collection lasting
perfection concealer I'm going in
sections because this computer does dry
pretty fast sometimes you want ice burst
and then I'm going to go
to the other eye I really love this
concealer it has full coverage and I
just I love it I love it so much it's
very affordable too I purchased mine on
eBay I mean on Amazon because I'm pretty
sure we can't get this concealer in the
States I get mine on Amazon I'm just
blending that in and I'm applying it to
the center of my face as well to
highlight that area so it looks all nice
and even I'm going to set every where I
put my concealer with the RCM a note
color powder
and then to set the rest of my makeup
I'm going to use the Wet n Wild photo
focus press powder in the shade warm
light and I'm going to use that to set
my foundation down okay so now that I
have my base products down I'm going to
jump into my eye makeup I'm going to
take this elf matte format - palette and
I'm going to take the first shade in the
palette and I'm going to use this kind
of set underneath my brow bone
for me personally it's not light enough
to be a brow bone highlight but it'll do
and then I'm going to take the second
shade in the palette it's like a really
pretty pinky Brown and I'm going to use
a big fluffy brush and I'm going to
press this into my crease I'm going to
apply a lot of this color I am going
back and forth with this shade and
building it up slowly but I want to make
sure that this is everywhere I love this
shade and I want the majority of my
eyelid to have this color then on a
smaller crease brush one that's a little
bit more precise and pointed I'm going
to take that other shade in the palette
this one is a little bit warmer not so
pink it's a little bit more peachy and
I'm going to use this on the outer
corners of my eyes and in my crease as
well here I'm just showing you the
difference in brushes I'm using this
shade with a more pointed more precise
brush just to make sure that it goes
directly into the crease and it's not
really diffused everywhere I want this
color focused in the crease now - heat
tape now I'm going to take this really
pretty chocolatey brown color and on a
small crease brush I'm going to buff
this onto the outer corners and dragging
it into my crease just a little bit I
want a little bit of depth to this look
so that's why I'm adding a dark brown
just to give a little bit of smokiness
to it and now I'm just going to do the
exact same process all over again I'm
going to take my crease shade my outer
corner shade and then that chocolate all
over again literally doing the exact
same steps with the exact same shades
you
I'm going to take that first shade in
the palette that bone color and I'm
going to apply this a little bit on the
inner corners of my lid and I'm going to
retouch my brow bone and I'm also going
to use that on my inner corners as well
and I was a little bit frustrated here
because my eyeliner got a little bit too
messy on my other eyes you can see I
mean it is a messy eyeliner look to
begin with that's how it turned out the
last time as well but I got a little bit
too thick this time on the other eye
I took the Inglot gel liner in the shade
89 and I use that as my eyeliner it's a
really pretty brown but it has a little
bit of purple to it I love the
combination of the warm shadows with
this eyeliner I took the black from the
elf palette and I'm just using this to
smudge really really close to my
waterline just to give a deeper effect
now I'm going to take the first crease
shade we use it's like that pinky Brown
and on a pencil brush I'm going to
smudge that on my lower lash line really
really smoky underneath there I love a
really smoked out lower lash line I like
to bring the color a little bit lower a
little bit more smudged so I took that
other crease shade and I'm just going
over it and then I took the chocolaty
color and I'm putting this on the outer
corner so that it matches my lid I'm
going to quickly put on some mascara I'm
going to put on my benefit roller lash
I'm going to put on my top and my bottom
lashes and then I'm going to go in with
some falsies these are the same falsies
I was wearing in my favorites video
they're really pretty they fan out at
the end so it gets really long towards
the end and I think it gives you like a
cool little effect so I'm just going to
pop these products on right now and I
will be right back to finish my face so
as you can see these falsies give such a
beautiful touch to this makeup it kind
of hides the smudgy eyeliner and it
looks so pretty I'm someone who rarely
wears falsies but I love how it looks
with this eye makeup anyway so I'm
bronzing my face slash contouring I'm
using the cover FX suntan bronzer and I
love it so much it makes my skin look
nice and tan obsessed with it for blush
I'm going in with my Physicians Formula
butter blush in the shade of Plum Rose
this is a very light shade of blush so I
do have to build up the pigmentation I
have to go in over and over and over
again when I do build up the color I
love how it looks is just so natural I
love this blush once I really pack it on
for highlight I'm going in with my girl
lactic luminous face veil in the shade
see-through it's a very intense metallic
highlight and I think it looks really
pretty I'm just highlighting all over
the place and then for my lips I'm
taking the coloured raine liquid
lipstick in the shade of suede it's a
cool unique Brown I love how it looks
with this eye makeup I love the
combination so much and then my camera
cut off and it didn't record but I
sprayed some Milani and make it last
setting spray but yeah my camera had
turned off and I didn't notice yeah that
completes this video guys thank you so
