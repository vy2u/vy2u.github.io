a call I recently made a purchase off of
visa for a website and I got a few
things and I also made a purchase on the
elf website and I thought I might as
well just smash the two halls together
and that's what we're doing today it was
a Sephora haul slash an elf ha and that
may seem weird but does what we're going
with I also have two products to show
you that I didn't purchase myself they
were sent to me they aren't part of the
Sephora haul or the alcohol it's
separate but I wanted to show them to
you anyway because I'm really excited
about them but we're mainly going to be
talking about all the goodies I just
purchased at Sephora and oh so we got a
little high end we got a little
drugstore oh by the way I do want to do
like an exclusive drugstore ha I just
recently bought a ton of things off of
the NYX website and I got that package
in the mail but I cannot find it I don't
know if Danny
misplaced it or he moved it I'm not sure
I was looking for it right before so I
found to film this video and I cannot
find it and I want to purchase a few
more drugstore things and still on the
hunt for a full face of drugstore
waterproof makeup and once I get
everything in the mail I will film a
drugstore version of waterproof makeup
tested
I'm just not done buying everything but
once I do I will film that video I've
just started because there are a lot of
things in this haul I know the super
stuffy my eyes are really red I keep
rubbing my eyes my foundation has come
off on my nose here it's like alright at
the bottom because my nose keeps running
just bear with me I have a cold it
happens okay so I might as well just
show you the things that I'm really
excited about that I didn't purchase
these were sent to me in PR this is the
anastacio liquid glow highlighters oh my
gosh I'm so excited for you I haven't
even opened them I wanted to open them
for the first time here on camera I've
seen so many cool pictures on the
anastacio Instagram I'm not huge on
liquid illuminators but I feel like on a
saucy can do no wrong in my eyes they
come up with really good stuff so this
is what the packaging looks like they
came out with four shades these are the
full colors and I am so excited to play
with these let's see what it looks like
swatch tamio swatch pearl this feels so
nice like the formula oh my god this
formula feels really nice
so I cannot wait to play Iran with those
and speaking of highlights the other
project that I just got NPR that I
wanted to show you was this this is a
new color pop palette I am loving all of
the new palettes color pop is releasing
with this super cute packaging but this
is a highlighting palette like I said
and it is the gimme more pressed powder
highlight palette and these colors are
very similar to the Nicole Guerrero glow
kit like soon as I opened it although
I'll say what you did their color pop
and they look very promising I've only
played around with this one this is the
one I'm wearing on my face right now and
it is so buttery and smooth I love this
color right here
i swatched all of them and this one is
definitely my favorite okay now we can
move on to those things I purchase I'm
going to start with Sephora and then we
can make our way to the elf stuff and
I'm going to try to go quickly because
there are a lot of things I purchased
this thing I purchased because of
nikkietutorials this is the j1 jelly
pack and it is a primer it says you get
dramatic firming skin with improved
elasticity and it's pore smoothing and
at first I was like wait a minute
Nicki story all said this with a primer
but this isn't sound like a primer but
when you go on the Sephora website it
says it's a multitasking anti-aging
formula that works as a hydrating
morning mask and a makeup gripping
primer so that's why I bought it
she said that it was way cheaper than
this which it totally is this is the
Sicily instant and long-term primer I
only purchase this to test it out
because this is a ridiculously pricy
primer it's very very good but I
personally don't think it's worth the
super high price tag and she said that
this one was even better so I got really
excited I immediately purchased it I try
to have my face for the first time today
like I'm using it as a primer and the
consistency totally threw me off it
looks pretty much like the same
consistency as the Sicily one but when
you go to blend this is so thick like
this is thick and as I was trying to
blend this out for the first time like
on my face it really threw me off it
kind of made me nervous but you have to
tap it into the skin once I saw that
rubbing was not working I really just
pushed it into my skin and I found that
I got an even application that way and
far so good hopefully it does keep my
makeup in place all day because that is
what the Sicily one is really good for
and I don't know I'm really excited to
continue to use it because it's really
freaky but I kind of like it okay a
super highly raved about product that I
just had to get my hands on this is a
Sephora Pro pigment palette and I got
the warm one obviously you guys saw that
coming they have an editorial one that's
full of different colors which I kind of
want to get after playing with this one
and they have a neutral one which is it
is extremely heavy this is like heavy
duty and the inside is a sundae peas
people I've seen a lot of people say
that this is a dupe for the nataschab
Jeannot sunset palette and I could
totally see that with this yellow and
these rents in these warm colors and I
was pleasantly surprised with it first
of all this mirror is fantastic well
like look at this was it that is amazing
but besides that these colors are so
pigmented if you're not careful you will
have an eyeshadow explosion on your eyes
because it does pack a heck of a punch
but I really really like them they're
very easy to blend I like how these
colors work together I'm not I really
enjoyed it I'm wearing this on my eyes
today right now
the only thing I will say is that I
tried out of new primer for the very
first time that I'm going to talk about
now in a minute
and I feel like this primer was so awful
then it kind of messed with the blend
ability of these eyeshadows even though
the primer sucked I think I still got a
pretty good application of these
eyeshadows so I highly recommend this
palette yes it is very very very pricey
it's like $68 almost 70 bucks for this
but you get a lot of colors there are a
lot of eyeshadows in here and when you
break them down and do the math it's not
so bad so I cannot wait to play around
with this a little bit more okay let's
talk about this horrible horrible
horrible primer this is the Sephora
tinted &amp;amp; Cooling eye primer I don't like
this I use this for the first time today
I got mine in the shade matte beige this
is the catchiest deep Bastian's
eyeshadow primer I think I've ever used
and I'm not trying to be dramatic or
anything but it was so hard to blend
this out and get like an even layer all
over my lid it was just so patchy it
would come up it was I just really did
not like this I don't know how this
works for anybody and
love this I'm so sorry it's just okay so
I kind of discovered a new brand on the
Sephora website I've never heard of this
brand before the name of the brand is
called antonyms Antonin I'm not exactly
sure if there's no brand new brand or
it's just new to Sephora but the
packaging looked so cute on everything I
really wanted to try out these two
products no three products three
products I wanted to try out they're
certified organic baked foundation and I
got mine in the shade light look how
pretty this packaging is it has wooden
packaging and I love it's so nice it
does feel pretty bulky like button so
pretty it comes with a mirror on the
inside and and really I just really like
this packaging and I also enjoy baked
products not all of them but for the
most part I really do enjoy baked
products just because they're a little
bit more hydrating on my dry skin and I
used this baked foundation for the first
time today and I really liked it I used
it on top of laker foundation I rarely
ever use baked foundations on their own
just because I liked a little bit more
coverage but I liked it it was very very
smooth it's set my foundation really
nicely and it kind of gave my skin like
a creaminess it's like a hydrating
powder foundation I really liked it and
the other two things I got from antonyms
were they're certified organic based
blushes I got two shades I got rose and
Peach and I'm wearing the peach shade
right now I love this peach shade how
huge is this but I mean it's a big blush
this is such a pretty color it goes on
so natural it's not too too pigmented
you do have to build this up a little
bit like you dip your brush in a few
times to get a lot of pigmentation but I
love that you guys know I love a
buildable blush I don't like anything
that's too intense and this is perfect
and it has kind of like a creamy
consistency it's I don't know it's yummy
I know it sounds weird but I really like
the formula it's a very light peach it
comes off a little bit lighter on the
skin then it looks in the pan but it
gives your skin a very natural peachy
flush and it's almost illuminating
without having a sheen to it and I also
picked up rose which is a more mathy
pink color this one also swatches a
little bit lighter than it looks in the
pan so just keep that in mind but I
really like these so far this one I
haven't tried but I like the other one
so far
oh I got a hair product this is the
Moroccan oil curl re-energizing spray I
just saw this on the support website oh
my god I want to try that it's supposed
to revitalize your girls and I have
curly hair I keep it straight well since
I'm not gonna lie but when I do have it
natural I like to use products that are
going to bring life back into my curls
because of so many years of flat ironing
my hair my curls are just not the same
so I really want to try this out it
sends a lightweight curl refresher
infused with nourishing argan oil that
reactivates end of day or two day curls
we shall see for me it's more like four
day curls okay I wash my hair like twice
a week but yeah this is to shake well
before you use it love the scent of
Moroccan oil products but I can embrace
so yeah I just suffered another friend
that I had never seen before and I
believe this brand is called axiology
that might be American Ashley and this
is the natural lipstick and this is the
natural lip crayon this brand really
intrigued me because they have a really
natural ingredients and even natural
packaging it says here that their
packaging is made from 100% recycled
paper which is awesome and everything is
all-natural with these products which I
want to get into trying more natural
makeup I actually want to do like a
natural makeup all I'm hauling way too
much but I would love to branch out and
try more natural products oh yeah like I
was saying this is a natural lip crayon
and I got mine in the shade serene but
and this oh oh no kind of got squished
but this is a really pretty like natural
Molly purpley Brown they have a really
nice creamy consistency and it has a
really pretty Sheen to it I mainly
bought it to try out the brand I've
never heard of this brand before and I
wanted to see how formula 1 but then I
also got the natural lipstick and I got
the shade philosophy and it is a really
really pretty peach I actually really do
like the packaging on this one you just
like click it right like this and
allistic comes out it's such a nice
peachy pink but I have a
beautiful sheen to it like when I first
watched it so pretty cannot wait to wear
this the anime last thing I got from
Sephora was the huda beauty lash glue it
says it's waterproof and fast drying and
I'm in the market for both of those
things
I read oh I got the darkstone wait I
thought I got a clear one I think I'm
the only person on the planet that
doesn't like dark tone lash glue but I'm
a little foolish with my last two and I
kind of get it everywhere and I need one
that just dries clear so I'm a little
bit sad do they not have a clear one I
can't think why I get this I don't know
whatever I'm so going to try it out I
might end up liking it you never know
that was everything I got at Sephora and
then these are the things I could fix it
myself
how cool is it that they came out with
an SPF of 50 I am so excited about this
it's an SPF 50 skin shielding
moisturizer antioxidant enriched skin
protection else is stepping up their
game like I don't know what they're
doing how to risk a like fire some
people and got a bunch of cool new
people but they're really stepping up
their game and I'm so excited to see
that they have an SPF and I love using
SPF 50 on my face I don't use anything
under oh it coming up tinted is cool
Geno's nice field - it doesn't look like
it'll have like a white cast all over
your face some SPF sleeve you looking a
little ghostly okay another mist I am a
big de to buy mist I'm not even sorry I
just need to try out everything before I
do my huge setting for a video I have to
try them all this is the elf hydrating
gel mist it says it's a gel to liquid
miss that plumps and hydrates
I kind of don't know if I like it I use
it today as kind of like a prepping
spray use it all over my face before I
apply my primer or anything like that
and it didn't feel hydrating it felt a
little bit sticky at first but then I
did sink into the skin
I didn't really notice it like really
hydrate or moisturize the skin the box
says you can use it throughout the
entire day but I wouldn't apply this on
top of makeup just because the gel
consistency can kind of s with your
foundation again I don't know how I feel
about it I would love to know your
opinion on this product down below
please please if you've tried this leave
me your thoughts down below because I'm
not sure how I feel I got too
they're beautifully bare natural glow
sticks with vitamin E I got pink pearl
and fresh morning dew this one obviously
has more of like a pinky reflect but
it's a little bit of golden as' to it
and then this one is more of like that
white not white but like pearly like
that pearly highlight or actually
nothing so definitely more of like a
clear highlight but I see what they're
doing I see what they're doing I thought
it was going to be a very pearlescent
like white shimmer eNOS but no like it's
just gonna make your skin look wet oh
I'm kind of digging this I'm not gonna
lie this would probably look really cool
like on the lids or on the top of the
cheekbone and a little bit more
editorial would look really cool like at
the beach just hit your cheek bone so
when the Sun hits it your cheeks look
wet or kind of like on your lip so it's
like a lip gloss maybe and then this one
has more of like a pinky pearly reflect
you can see right there and this one's
not have a nice sheen to it but as I'm
blending it on my skin the texture feels
a little off like it would blend away
into nothing kind of I don't know I got
a player on with this on the face I have
a feeling the formula is gonna be a
little bit tricky with this one okay and
then the last two products I am so
excited about there are two separate
products but I bought like all the
colors in each product so elves came out
with liquid lipsticks that's right matte
liquid lipsticks I got so excited when I
saw them on the website
I do get PR from elf but sometimes I
don't and then I saw these on the
website and I needed to get them like
right away
I was so excited to test them out I'm
wearing this one on my lips right now
this is in the shade praline and it
comes off darker on the lips than it
does in the tube a lot of liquid
lipsticks do at least on my lips these
feel very very similar to the color pop
ones not they're satin lips they're
matte liquid lipsticks where they dry
down completely there is no transfer
they almost have a powdery finish
they're very very matte so I would
recommend exfoliating before using these
because they will emphasize the lines
but they went on really smooth and they
don't feel drying I don't feel like I
have cement on my lips
came out with really pretty nude shades
too I was so happy to see these nudes I
love new colors and then they have these
fun berry shades I hope they come up
with more color that would love to see
some Browns and reds but definitely let
me know in the comments below if you
want me to do a lip swatch video
dedicated to these guys once I try all
of them let me know if you want to see
that and I will also add these to that
video if you want to see these as well
they also released lip plumping glosses
and I also love the colors they release
these I have not tried out yet actually
so I don't know if they're any good but
they just look so I love the packaging
by the way elf is really stepping it up
with this packaging let's try one on
right now this one is called mocha twist
I have a feeling these the elf liquid
lipstick doesn't last very long though
because they've only been wearing it for
like three hours and it's fading on the
inside of my mouth I don't really feel
any clumpiness right now I just feel a
little bit of a singleness like very
slight but yes very excited about these
plumping lip glosses as well okay guys
so that completes this video this one's
ever since I picked up at Sephora and on
the elf website leave me a comment down
below if there's any new products on the
market you want me to try like any new
makeup product or hair product or
skincare product I mean on the comments
below but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
the colors they release of this beast I
have these oh my god very very similar
to the nickel nickel what do not rub
this in tapika
pregnant Braeburn I don't I do it I'm
