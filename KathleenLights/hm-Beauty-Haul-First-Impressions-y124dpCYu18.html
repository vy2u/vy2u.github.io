an H&amp;amp;M beauty haul I'm not exactly sure
if H&amp;amp;M just recently launched a beauty
line actually I think they've had a
beauty line for a while but I'm under
the impression that they revamped it or
reformulated it change the packaging
something because I have been hearing a
lot of buzz about H&amp;amp;M Beauty recently
like very very recent so we decided to
place an order online and I have
everything in this bag right here I went
into an H&amp;amp;M and they didn't have a
beauty section so maybe it is a new
thing I don't know I heard little
pebbles say really good things about the
H&amp;amp;M I shadow so it kind of intrigued me
to dabble into the rest of the beauty
products so I just got everything in the
mail yesterday today is going to be kind
of like just a swatch video a haul a
little bit of a first impressions I have
some of the stuff on my face right now
so a haul / first impressions let's just
get into it shall we yes I was looking
online I didn't know what color to get
but I picked up a bronzer it's their
solar flare bronzing powder sheer
coverage sunkissed glow I really like
the box it's like somebody's face I like
it really quickly I want to talk about
the packaging so this is what the
bronzer looks like this is the packaging
it's just plastic it's black and then
the other side is white and it says H&amp;amp;M
in gold and then this is what it looks
like on the inside
personally I love H&amp;amp;M beauty packaging I
love it when everything got here in the
mail yesterday I was like wow it looks
so chic and so nice it looks
high-quality when you are looking at it
of course when you pick up the product
and you see it's plastic it's very
lightweight so when you are holding it
it doesn't feel luxurious it doesn't
feel heavy or like expensive and you
know what I mean but looking at it I
love it I think it has nicer packaging
than a lot of stuff at the drugstore so
even though it's cheap E plastic I think
it looks really really pretty I really
love how everything looks so I give the
packaging a thumbs up now in terms of
prices I would say that these are a
little bit more expensive like H&amp;amp;M
beauty's a little bit more
then I don't know typical drugstore
prices like elf
and NYC wet-and-wild those prices are a
lot cheaper than this this is kind of
like in the same category as L'Oreal or
Sonia Kashuk in terms of prices so not
extremely affordable when it comes to
drugstore but it's not high-end at all
it is affordable which I like so anyway
back to this so I got the bronzing
powder and I got mine in the shade
natural bronze and I like in the formula
but I'm not crazy about the color I wish
I would have gone with a different color
like I said I just winged it I picked it
out online it's really hard to see
things online but you can't tell right
now but it is a little bit more red tell
me what you think it's the bronzer I'm
wearing right now I did do like a light
layer of bronzer and it's the bronzer
I'm wearing but in terms of formula it's
really smooth really buttery very
pigmented and blends really really
nicely and I paid $9.99 for this I got
two of their nail polishes just because
I just wanted to test it out I have been
crazy about nail polish recently I
wanted to see if their nail polish was
any good and I am so impressed
like I'm so impressed I got two colors
right here I picked this one up because
I'm obsessed with blue nail polish I
know it's not very Folly but I thought
for the spring and summer I would really
get some use out of this this is in the
shade
skyhigh it's a delicious blue and then I
got this one this is go to greige which
is the nail polish I'm wearing right now
I am so impressed like I said I got this
yesterday so I put it on my nails
yesterday so I can't really tell you if
it's good in terms of chipping but it
was so creamy so easy to work with I
love the brush because it kind of has
like a fatter brush so it covers the
entire nail really nicely and I was
shocked at how opaque and creamy it was
the formula is so good but I want to
pick up more H&amp;amp;M nail polishes now I got
three blushes because I wanted to test
out the different colors this one is in
the shade brown sugar I love the
packaging of the blushes they look like
this and the bottom is gold instead of
white I love it it's very sleek really
pretty the only thing that sucks is
they don't have a mirror in them that
could be a hit or miss for some people
but this is in the shade brown sugar
it's so beautiful it's like a warm
peachy nude really really pretty I love
the formula of these blushes I'm very
very very impressed the formula is
really nice it almost feels creamy to
the touch it's not powdery or chalky for
some reason I keep comparing it to the
forever 21 Beauty line in my mind
because I have tried I think it's called
love and beauty is that what their line
is called I'm not sure I don't know what
it is about them some of their products
are chalky not very pigmented I just was
not impressed with forever21 makeup but
Wow so far so good these blushes are
really really creamy I'm wearing another
color right now but very very pigmented
and easy to blend so this one is brown
sugar yes this is the shade apricot is
what it looks like these blushes next to
each other they look a little bit
similar it's just it was hard for me to
choose I couldn't tell the difference in
colors on line so but this one is
lighter like much lighter on the skin
than brown sugar and a lot more peachy
but still really pretty wearable it has
no glitter no shimmer it's a nice matte
but it's not a flat matte and then this
is the one I'm wearing right now and
this one is called cameo pink and again
looks pretty similar but this one is a
lot more like cool toned just like a
natural everyday pink so so pretty it's
what I'm wearing on if you can tell but
it was really easy to blend I just added
a little bit beautiful beautiful color I
highly recommend cameo pink if you have
like fair skin okay so a product I
wasn't too oh by the way those blushes
are $9.99 I think this is the first time
in the history of the world who actually
look really on camera I'm sweating my
balls off right now okay so a product I
wasn't too crazy about when I tried it
this is the hmm okay all this stuff is
H&amp;amp;M so I don't have to say that this is
their precision I always say that word
weird I know precision eye marker this
is the shade jet-black it is very very
black I'm the first time that i swatched
it on the back of my hand I was like oh
my gosh I'm gonna love this so when I
applied it to my
today when I went to go do the flick of
the wing like this whole process was
easy but when I went to do the flick it
like wasn't very pigmented it didn't go
on very black and it was the first time
that I had used it it was just hard to
make a sharp wing like it flared out it
got I just it was weird I don't know I
had a weird experience with this not my
favorite so I would say pass on the hmm
liquid liner and go for like NYC it's
much cheaper or go for the Jesse's girl
one that's cheaper as well I wasn't too
impressed with this okay let's talk
about something that I am very impressed
with so impressed with I got three of
their nope wait wait wait wait I got
three of their cream lip colors three of
their lipsticks I have to say that the
packaging on these lipsticks makes me
happy like it makes me giddy
I want to display these lipsticks like
that's how much I love the packaging let
me show you let me show you so I got
three colors I got this one which this
is the one I'm wearing right now this
one is called rust me and online all of
these lipstick like all of the lipsticks
looked shimmery so I was like whoa is
this like a glaze of frost finish I'm
not into that but I decided to take the
plunge since they were called cream lip
colors I thought maybe just the picture
was off and I was right none of these
have shimmer or glitter or like a frosty
finnish there true cream finish so like
I said this one has rust me it's what
I'm wearing these lipsticks are $9.99
everything is like $9.99 look how
beautiful this packaging is how
beautiful look at it I love that it's
round
I mean it's plastic but it has a
beautiful gold bottom and the top is
white and it says H&amp;amp;M in gold it's so
pretty and then the lipstick is gold I
love it I love it I just think white and
gold looks so pretty and this will look
so nice like sitting on your vanity and
it looks fancy even though it's $9.99
you know so this is in the shade rust me
it's what I'm wearing right now
the formula is unreal it doesn't have a
scent I was really scared that
was gonna have like a weird lore'l scent
or something like but it doesn't I mean
I would have liked them to smell like
vanilla but no scent is better than a
bad set you know this color right here
reminds me a lot like a second I put it
on it reminds me so much of the
Charlotte Tilbury um lipstick in stoned
rose I feel like they're almost
identical I don't know I have to swatch
them side-by-side but it instantly
reminded me of that and that's like 32
and this is 10 I highly recommend the
lipsticks not just because of the
packaging but they are so creamy and
even though I haven't been wearing this
for more than like four hours I feel
like these are very long wearing because
they're so pigmented with just one swipe
on the back of your hand it's full color
like full opaque color
there's no Sheerness to this at all when
I have a lipstick that I have to pass
over my lips like 20 million times to
get full on color those lipsticks never
last on me like they fade throughout the
day really quickly these super super
pigmented ones usually last longer
now it's not matte is that cream sat in
a little bit of a shine it has that kind
of finish so I would recommend using a
lip liner because it can get a little
bit messy so using a lip liner is
perfect I didn't today just so you can
see like the full color of this but
overall I would say these are a huge hit
for me so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you the other two colors I got this one
is in the shade cream chestnut
I got like they're all in the same
family like warm brownie nudie colors
cream chestnut a really really pretty
brownie nude cream chestnut though is
perfect for like everyday just a slap on
and then this one is called hay day and
this is another brown but much deeper
than cream chestnut such a beautiful
Brown I love these lipsticks I highly
recommend
I got this bad boy right here because it
was 399 and I thought I would just give
it a shot this is their precision that
word sponge it's basically like a Beauty
Blender dupe I'm not exactly sure if
it's a Dukas
first time I grabbed it well it's got
nice what mine is like squished flat I
would have to see I would have to use it
run it under water see if it expands I
don't know but it was 399 and I thought
it would go to shop the only sponge that
I think comes close to the Beautyblender
is the Real Techniques one I haven't had
any luck with other dupes out there but
can't knock it till you try it okay so I
went a little crazy with eyeshadows I
got four different colors this was such
a mission for me because online it's not
very true to color so it was hard for me
there's one in here that I think is
freaking amazing and you need to buy
yesterday so anyway like I was saying
earlier Lily pebbles kind of inspired
the whole hmm thing for me she really
liked the eyeshadows and that's why I
picked up four and they are so good she
was so right so right so this is the one
that I picked up because of her and it's
my favorite one this is the one that you
need to go out and buy it's amazing I
can't pronounce it to save my life and
I'm not even gonna try it
bassy the alumnae Baci di dama someone's
gonna comment below like really you
don't how to say that this is what the
packaging looks like on the eyeshadows I
really love it I love gold I'm a sucker
for gold and white so the bottom is
white and then the rim is gold and you
see the color of the eyeshadow through
the lid which I really like for some
reason I didn't think that the
eyeshadows were gonna be that good I
kind of underestimated H&amp;amp;M but these are
amazing amazing amazing amazing they
feel like high-end high-quality
fantastic shadows how much are these
these are $6.99 so a little bit more
expensive than like maybelline shadows
but I think they're much better so this
is the shade that you need to go out and
buy 100% it's what I'm wearing on my lid
like on the inner corners right here and
on the majority of my lid this is the
perfect everyday shade it's so pigmented
I didn't feel the need to like grab my
fix plus it was so good guys so good you
need this eyeshadow you need it you need
it then I got this one this one is
called orange ochre it's a
really pretty orange color that has like
a bunch of gold glitter all throughout
it but it's not a glittery shadow I
don't know how to explain it it's mostly
matte in my opinion the gold glitter you
don't really see show up on your skin I
have this color on the outer corners of
my eyes very slightly just dusted a
little bit on the outer corners and it's
amazing now these two kind of threw me
off a little bit because there are
different formulas than those eyeshadows
I don't know a very very glittery which
I don't mind because they're actually
very good I'll show you I said water
nice my Porter wants to say oh no don't
look my physic pick up oh boy
or does my daughter who is my baby but
that's my baby
how does my believe me little Joisey
Joisey okay anyway so I got this one in
the shade peach life which is not Paige
at all this is what it looks like it's a
really pretty pinky like a warm pink
that has a ton of silver glitter all
over it the glitter really really shows
up on your skin like I don't know how
it's gonna apply on to my eye but it was
very sparkly and very very very pretty
it has like a sheen like it's really
nice I like it and then this one is kind
of very similar in the sense that it's
very glittery and all that good stuff
this one is called golden light it's a
pure gold color like pure gold and
really sparkly a really glittery really
pretty okay and then two more things and
xenon zone I was so excited to see that
they had liquid lipsticks and they're
called their velvet lip creams the one
that I wanted was sold out online so I
couldn't get it I got this one this
one's called enchant and it is a really
pretty cool tone pink has a little bit
of purple in there and when i swatched
it on the back of my hand it seems like
a really good formula I'm not exactly
sure it has like that moosie texture I
would have to wear it to tell you guys
but I'm very excited to see that HN has
liquid lipsticks and these were $9.99
and then the last thing I got I decided
to try out something other than makeup
they have a hue
which line I'm talking like hair masks
shampoos creams they have a bunch of
things so I decided to get this right
here this is their intuition shower
cream a gently conditioning and shower
treatment for all skin types and I got
it because it was chamomile like scented
and I love chamomile anything and I love
the packaging
this was $6.99 and it has orange oil
olive oil and all that good stuff to me
it doesn't really smell I haven't used
it yet but to me doesn't really smell
like chamomile all that much but it does
smell good it's a little perfume me I
don't know I was like oh because I love
chamomile it doesn't really smell like
it but I don't know maybe it's a good
shower product maybe it's nice and
moisturizing I don't know yet
I will let you know so that is
everything I picked up I wish I would
have tried like the foundation in the
concealer because they had a huge like
makeup line but these are just the
products that I was interested in trying
leave me a comment down below if you
tried something from the H&amp;amp;M Beauty line

include in this video because mama will

really good job so yes thank you guys so
