obviously going to be my 2015 favorites
video I sound so stuffy and like
discussing I'm kind of like coming out
from a cold or something I don't know
what it was I was so sick yesterday
these are things that have just stuck
with me all 2015 like I just like was
looking at I was like oh my god I've had
this like all year this is my life
favorite thing so I'm just going through
my stuff and so i'm going to show you
guys if he thinks so the first step i'm
going to show you guys is makeup
province this is the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and this is just
how i've used all year you guys know
that because like i mentioned it and
like all of my makeup tutorials all year
and i was going to pick the tartlet
palette because it's one of my new
favorites but because it is newer I've
realized like I might not be using it
and him next year but this I've
definitely been using all your like I at
least use like Tuesday's of this every
single time I do my makeup so love this
next product is this tart bronzer and
this is oh my god I put my hand in the
black eyeshadow this next it is the tart
bronzer and this is Park at princess and
again I have used this all year I've
probably been using it more than just
2015 I think I used a little bit before
but I love this it is just the perfect
bronzing shade I don't know it just goes
really really good with my skin color
even when I don't have a spray tan I
just love this next is a foundation and
this is a bit newer but I absolutely
love this and I'm probably going to be
using it most of 2016 because at the
beginning of this year I use like a Mac
foundation and I just really really
wasn't liking it and since I found this
like I seriously don't see myself
straying from this at all ever it's the
perfect coverage perfect shade for me
and absolutely love it so yeah well this
next I've been using this for most of
the year as well and this is just the
Heighliner this is in soft and gentle it
is Mac and I obviously I don't even know
like what I can say about this I have it
on my cheeks today I have it on my
cheeks about every day so I really
really love this and it's the perfect
like shimmer i also like after i bought
this this was the first a highlighter
ever bought which shows you know like
i've used it for such a long time but
after i bought this I've got more into
like the mask
get finishes so I bought like the global
not global glow when I by o gold deposit
i bought gold deposit and i just love
both of these they're so perfect so i
love this one moving on to mascara i
have this one and this is roller lash my
benefit and this one is my absolute
favorite mascara actually just tried out
a new mascara today and I'm not really
liking it that much um so I know for
sure like this is really my favorite I
was using the benefit um what is it
called i was using another benefit
mascara before this one and i really
really liked it but after this one came
out I was like wait this one's so much
better so I absolutely love this makes
my lashes 20 hundred times longer like
I'm just going to show you guys the
brush I know this is it like a makeup
review but it's not even gonna focus I
love them and I never really wear false
lashes so this really does the trick
lastly for makeup this is the anastasia
dipbrow pomade and soft brown so I
really was struggling with my eyebrows I
was looking at old videos today like
makeup videos and I was like what was I
doing with my eyebrows like I literally
have no idea so ever since I found this
this year like this has really really
helped because I was kind of scared of a
palm bay because I was like I don't know
what to do this like sticky weird pace
down but ever since i've used it has
really really helped my eyebrows look so
much better and yeah I don't know what
else I would use other than this so Dave
you know you have something in your
shower and it gets like water in the cap
and we open it up and then the water
like pours everywhere and you're like oh
okay like that's just what happened on
my bed and no I'm sitting in a puddle of
water anyway so I'm going to start with
this this is the gurney air clean I
don't even know black hat eliminating
scrub and I absolutely love this because
it's most super venti and it makes my
skin feel like really good
and it has like exfoliants in it but
it's not the exfoliant center in like
the state I've scrub which is what i did
use actually just right now or probably
be in this video but this one has
exfoliant like little beads but it's not
really harsh on your skin it's like you
can lightly feel them and I really like
that and I just feel like this has
helped me the most like apparently like
charcoal really really helps block head
so such marcolin it the next two things
have been a part of my daily routine
since like I don't even know when they
have always always been in my routine
and this is the Bochy on makeup I don't
even know if that's how you say it
makeup breakup pool cleansing oil so
this is what i use to take my makeup off
literally I there's nothing else I found
that I really like more than this I
really like the way it feels like I can
literally see the makeup like coming off
on my face so I love that and so I just
like put two pumps of this in my hand
and then I just bought a new one so it
was like in the box but I just put two
pumps of it in my hand and I just wash
on my face and then after I watch that
on my face I use these and these are
just huggies wipes and you guys are
probably like caton like what are you
doing you guys know if you sell my
winter routine that I posted like last
year of I use these I've always used
honey webs for like two years now and I
just used it to take off like the excess
like anything else extra on my face just
a really quick thing lime on skin care I
know a lot of you guys have been asking
me like how do you keep your skin so
clean whatever if you guys want to see a
actual skin care routine like made
showing you guys everything I do in the
morning and at night that kind of thing
then pause the video right now go
comment in the comments down below and
say I want to see the skin care routine
and I will be doing one very very soon
in 2016 if you guys want to see that so
yeah now that you have unposed me let's
move on you guys know I love candles
like literally there's over like
30-something candles in my room
currently and so I'm going to be showing
you guys two of my favorite candles the
first one is the eucalyptus mint and
this one is just like the men taste a
little like like it smells so good it
smells like the stress relief stuff
that's a bath and body works it smells
just like that also
sciences are super backed up so that
kind of helped so I have this one and
then the other one I think is just
seasonal and it is the radiant red maple
I don't know why I love this set so much
I should have bought like 10 of these
because I haven't like used it all up
yet and I'm going to really really soon
but I just really really love this all
of this but hopefully they have it next
year or maybe it's not seasonal I don't
know but this one smells really good it
smells like kind of like waffles but
like army middle kind of smelled like
waffles smells like syrup is moving on
to two random favourites before I get
into some other stuff the first one is
this Daisy Marc Jacobs perfume and it
hasn't even it doesn't even look like I
use that much of it only cuz I don't
spray this on myself every oh can I go
to school I don't spray Daisy work Jacob
zombie but if I'm like dressing up or
going somewhere I'll spray this and the
smell of it guys it smells so freaking
good I actually had like the summer one
in the beginning of this year and that
would smell really really good but I
used it all up and then I had this one
so they're both really really good i
love marc jacobs cracking so this one
has been with me all year the next
favorite is my daniel wellington watch
so i have been showing you guys genuine
two watches all year like obviously if

favorites and her album is really really
good it's for pink walls I'm looking at

purpose has been the best also going
along with that is when directions album

amazing another artist that I've been
obsessed with this year is bryson tiller
