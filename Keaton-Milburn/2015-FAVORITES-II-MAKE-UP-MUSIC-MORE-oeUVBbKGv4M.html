obviously going to be my 2015 favourites
video I sound so stuffy and like
discussing I'm kind of like coming out
from a cold or something I don't know
what it was I was so sick yesterday
these are things that have just stuck
with me all of 2015 like I just like was
looking and I was like oh my god I've
had this like all year this is my
favorite thing so I'm just going through
my stuff and so I'm gonna show you guys
if he thinks so the first step I'm going
to show you guys is makeup Provence this
is the semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
and this is just how I'd used all year
you guys know that because like I
mentioned it and like all of my makeup
tutorials all year and I was going to
pick the Tarte lip palette because it's
one of my new favorites but because it
is newer I've realized like I might not
be using it and him next year but this
I've definitely been using all year like
I at least use like two shades of this
every single time I do my makeup so love
this next product is this Tarte bronzer
and this is oh my god I put my hand in
the black eyeshadow this next it is the
Tarte bronzer and this is Park app
princess and again I have used this all
year I've probably been using it more
than just 2015 I think I used it a
little bit before but I love this it is
just the perfect bronzing shade I don't
know it just goes really really good
with my skin color even when I don't
have a spray tan I just love this next
is a foundation and this is a bit newer
but I absolutely love this and I'm
probably going to be using it most of
2016 because at the beginning of this
year I use like a Mac foundation and I
just really really wasn't liking it and
since I found this like I seriously
don't see myself straying from this at
all ever it's the perfect coverage
perfect shade for me and absolutely love
it so yeah love this next I've been
using this for most of the year as well
and this is just the highlighter this is
in soft and gentle it is Mac and I
obviously I don't even know like what I
can say about this I have it on my
cheeks today I have it on my cheeks
about every day so I really really love
this and it's the perfect like shimmer I
also like after I bought this this was
the first a highlighter ever bought
which shows you know like I've used it
for such a long time but after I bought
this I've got more into like the mask of
it finishes so I bought like the global
not global glow why did i buy
Oh gold deposit I bought gold deposit
and I just love both of these they're so
perfect so love this one
moving on to mascara I have this one and
this is roller lash my benefit and this
one is my absolute favorite mascara
actually just tried out a new mascara
today and I'm not really liking it that
much so I know for sure like this is
really my favorite I was using the
benefit what is it called I was using
another benefit mascara before this one
and I really really liked it but after
this one came out I was like wait this
one's so much better so I absolutely
love this makes my lashes 20 hundred
times longer like I'm just gonna show
you guys the brush I know this isn't
like a makeup review but focus I love
them and I never really wear false
lashes so this really does the trick
lastly for makeup this is the Anastasio
dip brow pomade and soft brown so I
really was struggling with my eyebrows I
was looking at old videos today like
makeup videos and I was like what was I
doing with my eyebrows like I literally
have no idea so ever since I found this
this year like this has really really
helped because I was kind of scared of a
palm bay because I was like I don't know
what to do with this like sticky weird
paste um but ever since I've used it has
really really helped my eyebrows look so
much better and yeah I don't know what
else I would use other than this so you
know when you have something in your
shower and it gets like water in the cap
and you open it up and in the water like
pores everywhere and you're like okay
like that's just what happened on my bed
and now I'm sitting in a puddle of water
anyway so I'm gonna start with this this
is the Garnier lean I don't even know
blackhead eliminating scrub and I
absolutely love this because it smells
super venti and it makes my skin feel
like really good
and it has like exfoliants in it but
it's not the exfoliant that are in like
the state i've scrub which is what I did
use actually just right now or probably
be in this video but this one has
exfoliant like little beads but it's not
really harsh on your skin it's like you
can lightly feel them and I really like
that and I just feel like this has
helped me the most like apparently like
charcoal really really helps blackhead
so it's a circle in it the next two
things have been a part of my daily
routine since like I don't even know
when they have always always been in my
routine and this is the boshi of makeup
I don't even know if that's how you say
it
makeup breakup pool cleansing oil so
this is what I use to take my makeup off
literally I there's nothing else I found
that I really like more than this I
really like the way it feels like I can
literally see the makeup like coming off
on my face so I love that and so I just
like put two pumps of this in my hand
and then I just bought a new one so it's
like in the box but I just put two pumps
of it in my hand and I just wash up my
face and then after I watch that on my
face I use these and these are just
Huggies wipes and you guys are probably
like Caitlyn like what are you doing you
guys know if you saw my winter routine
that I posted like last year I use these
I've always used honey wipes for like
two years now and I just use it to take
off like excess like anything else extra
on my face just a really quick thing
lime on skincare I know a lot of you
guys have been asking me like how do you
keep your skin so clean whatever if you
guys want to see a actual skincare
routine like me is showing you guys
everything I do in the morning and at
night that kind of thing then pause the
video right now go comment in the
comments down below and say I want to
see your skincare routine and I will be
doing one very very soon in 2016 if you
guys want to see that so yeah now that
you have unpause me let's move good you
guys know I love candles like literally
there's over like 30-something candles
in my room currently and so I'm going to
be showing you guys two of my favorite
candles the first one is the eucalyptus
mint and this one is just like the mint
tastes a little like like it smells so
good it smells like the stress relief
stuff that's about the money work it
smell so just like that also
my sciences are super banged up so that
kind of helped out so I have this one
and then the other one I think is just
seasonal and it is the radiant red maple
I don't know why I love this scent so
much I should have bought like 10 of
these because I haven't like used it all
up yet and I'm going to really really
soon but I just really really love this
all of this but hopefully they have it
next year or maybe it's not seasonal I
don't know but this one smells really
good it smells like kind of like waffles
but like moving on to two random
favorites before I get into some other
stuff the first one is this Daisy Marc
Jacobs perfume and it hasn't even it
doesn't even look like I use that much
of it only because I don't spray this on
myself
every day when I go to school I don't
spray these new Marc Jacobs zombie but
if I'm like dressing up or going
somewhere I'll spray this and the smell
of it guys it smells so freakin good I
actually had like the summer one in the
beginning of this year and that would
smell really really good but I used it
all up and then I had this one so
they're both really really good I love
Marc Jacobs perfume so this one has been
with me all year the next favorite is my
Daniel Wellington watch so I have been
showing you guys Jenny willing to watch
us all year like obviously if you've
seen any of my videos you guys know I
love doing you're willing to watches
this one it's like a more tan color this
one goes with a lot more stuff that I
have and I'm obsessed with rose gold

my favorite thing and this has like the
rose gold face on it I just love it so

moving on to music of this year that I
have absolutely loved a lot of the music
I'm gonna be listing is like more kind
of like current music but that's just
because that's what I've been listening
to the most and I feel like that's what
I've really been like loving the most if
it
stuck with me all year they probably
didn't like it the most anyway moving on
so the first one I want to mention is at
least your car you guys know I
absolutely love her I mentioned her like
a long time ago she's been one of my
favorites and her album is really really
good it's four pink walls I I'm looking
at like the titles or something that
means but yeah it's for people as ELISA
has been amazing also I have really
really loved Justin Bieber's new album
it is seriously if you guys don't have
it yet you need to go buy it because
it's not just like little fangirls
loving his music his music is really
really expanded a lot and a lot of
people are now listening to him and I
absolutely love him I have since like
day one I love him so much so his new
album purpose has been the best also
going along with that is one Direction's
album I'm so sad they're taking a break
because anyone else like so super
depressed like praying that they come
back but anyway their album has been
amazing another artists that I've been
obsessed with this year is Bryson tiller
you guys know like seriously for the
past like three months I've just been
like playing Bryson tiller every single
day of my life
hopefully I'll get to see him in
February he's coming to Houston so I
really really want to see the dad Selena
Gomez new album revival I absolutely
love it not just like same old love and
hands too many sell pants myself is
really really good I like it a lot but
there's other ones on your album that
are like just as good camouflage is
really good and I'm pretty sure it's
like about Justin Bieber but it's really
really good obviously Drake back to back
has been like amazing what a time to be
alive with Drake and feature both of
those albums like killed me oh my god I
can't believe I didn't mention this
literally my favorite Big Sean's album
dark sky paradise that has literally
changed my life every song in that album
just gives me like oh my god I just love
it so much every song I love Big Sean if
you guys didn't know that and his new
album has been I say new it's really not
new but whatever this year it came out
and I have loved every bit of it every
single song so you guys haven't heard it
go check it out and then the last artist
that I really really loved is Pia Mia
she has come out with a few singles this
year and I feel like she's really really
gonna grow and going into the next year
I'm excited to see what other music
so yeah my last favorite that I want to
mention is obviously you guys you guys
have been amazing and you guys probably
don't even like know this but at this
time like literally this time last year

twenty thousand I I just read it the
other day made 17,000 subscribers on
YouTube this time last year and this
