am 21 so today is my 21st birthday and
to celebrate I thought I would do
something a little less traditional than
a regular 21 year old oh do I have some
of my closest friends and family and
we're doing 21 acts of kindness I wanted
to do this to kind of honor my life
motto and that's because nice matters I
just think that it's so important to you
know show people that they matter in to
spread kindness and love and you know
give people a little extra encouragement
today and I hope that I can inspire
other people to also just be kind and do
nice things for other people so thanks
for watching this video and I hope that
you can be inspired by it too
now we're on free ride ska and basically
if you play this game and however many
words you get right get right
it puts rice in a little bowl and
corporate companies will donate food to
third-world countries that need our help
so free rice calm
give her one big you know bit of advice
to stay healthy and living a long life
what would that be good everybody
because they're friends every from
everywhere
so we came to the Galleria because I
felt like it was a place where there's a
lot of people we can impact we just gave
like 20 balloons to all these little
children at the children's area they
were so excited about it three holding
the door for 21 people since it's my
21st birthday and then another thing
that's very important to me is body love
and just making people feel beautiful
and happy with the skin that they have
so we're writing encouraging notes and
Bible verses and putting them on stores
and dressing rooms just to make women
and people feel beautiful and another
thing we're doing is because Saint
Patrick's Day was yesterday I was
feeling kind of lucky so we put a bunch
of little pennies all over the place
that are facing heads up so we can bring
someone some luck and another thing that
I'm doing is I'm very passionate about
education and that children you know
should be reading constantly to grow
their minds and grow their hearts so
we're putting a bunch of little books I
have all the front ones this one's about
Easter I have green eggs and ham like
all different ones that we're just going
to put all over the place and hopefully
a child will pick it up and enjoy it
we're at the Hilton off of Post Oak and
for this act of kindness I chose this
specific place because there's a special
person here that means a lot to me this
is where I I have competed in every
pageant I've ever competed in and a man
named Elijah he's the bellhop every time
I come here he brings so much joy and
comfort and peace to me he greets me
with hugs and encouragement and every
time I see him he just honestly
brightens my day hi my name is Madison
Lee and I'm one of Logan's really good
friends and we're here at st. Luke's
Hospital we're doing 21 acts of kindness
today because it's their 21st birthday
and so this is one of our stops we
stopped here at st. Luke's Hospital and
we went to one of the nurses stations
which is really cool because I'm
actually doing a clinical down here for
nursing school so I have clinicals on
Fridays here at Saint Luke's Hospital
and so we got it to go up to the floor
that I've been working on and teasing
the nurses and give them some flowers
just to show our appreciation for them
and it was really awesome because I mean
you saw their faces and they were
shocked that we came by just to say
thank you for what they do for our
community and for their patients and
they have such a big heart so it was
really exciting we could tell that we
just really made their day and this
whole day has been incredible but it's
just like it's so much fun getting to
give back to the community whenever it's
Logan's 21st birthday she has such a big
heart
and just doing these little act of
kindness really shows who she is and the
kind of person that she is
mara Hermann Park right here okay so
we're here at the Ronald McDonald House
and I'm so excited for this special act
because we're going to be doing an
Easter egg hunt with all the children
and their families that live here this
place is so special with me because a
very special friend of mine named Julia
Cobb and her family used to live here so
we're going to give back to this
community that touched my heart and such
a deep back
Oh
my favorite part is the fact that Logan
did this her 21st birthday it's so
traditional I guess for me to go out and
do different things I think it's so cool
that Logan Jesus has a platform to
change people's lives
and make people smile but my favorite
part is the fact that Logan this isn't
just for her birthday and this isn't
just one day out of the year this is her
life and this is something she really
stands for and lives by and she doesn't
just say it but she puts into action and
that's so cool to me he's to have
someone to look up to and even when we
were at the retirement home she was
asking hey can I have your number so I
can come back and follow up and I think
that's really cool but she wants to
follow up and continue doing this and
impact lights and she's a lot ahead of
her
it's just this whole day this whole
thing was planned by Logan she spent
hours and hours planning for so long now
and she Scott is so excited about every
single thing everything we've done today
she's mapped out to a tee with timing
and you can tell how much effort she's
put in and how much heart she's put in
to really try to affect as many people
as she can my favorite part during the
day has been to that like this Easter
egg hunt with the children they were so
excited they tried to sneak and didn't
want to start on time they just ran to
the eggs they were running all over and
then opening up the eggs and we are
playing and blowing bubbles and just
giggling and nothing's better than
hearing a child laugh and see them smile
and just to be a part of that and to be
a part of this day I feel so honored and
so inspired by such one of my closest
friends this whole day's Whiston what
been wonderful it really has and it's so
much of what Logan is like it's just
such a beautiful girl now so I'm even
more so on the inside it's gonna be out
here with the kids I've seen them all
running around and have a blast I really
don't know who's having more fun though
myself with the kids it's been such a
great day and that's that we probably my
most
fine part is being hiding bags for the
kids and he was having a blast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
