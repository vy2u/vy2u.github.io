so today's video is going to be for a
last-minute mira the-- outfit ideas so i
really want to film this video because i
kind of saw it as like a challenge for
me i don't have a lot of clothes that I
brought here with me back to Texas a lot
of my like really cute clothes are back
in Arizona so I wanted to try and come
up with four last-minute New Year's Eve
out that ideas without buying anything
just using items that are in my closet
already and I feel like a lot of people
like those shopping for news even they
try so hard like have this big look and
like for me I never end up having
anything really cute I just end up
wearing like a shimmery top and jeans
and that's basically it so I thought it
would be cool to show you guys a few
ideas of mine these outfits are
obviously not like go into like a club
it's not like a fancy party some people
go to really really fancy parties on New
Year's Eve I personally just hang out
with my friends and you know fireworks
and we watch the show whatever so I
normally do very casual outfits which
jeans and a body suit or something like
that so if you guys are having any plans
like that panniers need these outfits
will be super super helpful so yeah
let's just get right into the video so
for this first outfit I'm wearing a
bodysuit from princess Polly it's like
sequiny shiny I thought it was really
pretty veneers and I paired it with my
Gucci belt and then this skirt is also
from princess Polly I love it it's just
black fringe on the bottom and I wanted
to wear some black thigh-highs with it
because I thought that just helped to
look make a little bit edgier and then
the necklace is stars with some silver
hoops the necklace is from brandy
melville as well so this is just a
really simple outfit from the ears the
bodysuit is from brandy melville black
long-sleeve I'm wearing it with these
jeans from Topshop they're in the style
Jamie and I just like to wear a really
long necklace with a low-cut shirt
because I think it looks really pretty
so this necklace is from the in duelers
and I absolutely love this look
the next outfit is super simple as well
so I'm wearing actually blue velvet
thigh-highs they're from Steve Madden
and wearing my M jewelers necklaces that
I always wear and then the long-sleeve
gray tea is from real thing and this is
just also a very simple look for years
as well I thought it just fit my style
perfectly and for the last look I got
this dress this one is from princess
Polly as well I just thought this was
super simple and this dress is super
trendy right now I see these everywhere
and I feel like it's super bold and
makes a statement but also being simple
at the same time so I thought it would
be perfect for Neer's thank you guys so
