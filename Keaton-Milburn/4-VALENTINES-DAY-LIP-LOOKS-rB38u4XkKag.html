to be a Valentine's Day look obviously
and I know this is literally the day
before Valentine's Day but I really
wanted to get this up anyway and I love
the makeup look I hope you guys like
these look colors I'm obsessed with them
currently so hope you guys enjoy the
video and let's get into it so before we
get any farther into the tutorial I'm
definitely wearing the top it is
obviously just sleeveless so you can't
see you but moving on I'm starting off
with my nyx concealer and i'm just
covering up any blemishes that i have
which would be like on my chin my
forehead and you've red areas just
cancel that out before i put my
foundation on and then i'm blending it
out with a Beauty Blender so I'm going
in with my new favorite foundation this
is the Make Up For Ever foundation I
don't know all the exact names so
obviously I'm gonna leave all the makeup
link to below but seriously the coverage
on this guy's is so amazing and it
seriously matches my skin perfect thank
you guys obviously you can't tell I have
a spray tan so I have to bring the
foundation like all the way down my neck
to match my Itachi's free-dance
so yeah that is this foundation and then
going in with my Maybelline age rewind
concealer so I'm making triangles but
I'm expanding these a little bit so I'm
making super like big triangles because
this is gonna be a more highlighted look
so I'm putting that in my eyes and then
I'm blending that out with a beauty now
to contour I'm going in with my pear
contour stick and I'm just making a
little line on my jaw and going up like
halfway up to my forehead not all the
way and then underneath guys this is the
way contour it probably sucks but this
is what works for me so I'm blending
this out with a Beauty Blender and yeah
so this is what I've been doing recently
to make my face as they would say so I'm
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm putting this underneath
my eyes I'm also going to be putting it
like where just wherever I put my
highlighting and then I'm putting it
underneath my contour this is a super
super messy way to make your face but I
am NOT professional is just the way I do
my makeup so yeah I'm just doing Anna my
contour and then I'm going to leave it
there so I'm moving on while that sits
I'm doing my eyebrows and I'll show you
guys exactly what I'm doing it's kind of
hard just filling them in so we have
used the innocence dip brow and soft
brown and that and then I'm
my benefit benefit benefit gimme brow
and I'm just setting up eyebrows the
city and then I'm gonna wipe off the
translucent powder because you can't
even open too long you just look really
white and gross and I know the lighting
looks weird here but I promise it works
so then I'm using the white or like
highlighting part of me contour stick I
had and I'm shaping my eyebrow so I'm
also putting it over my whole entire
eyelid because it makes for a base on my
eyeshadow so I'm putting that in with my
finger
and then I'm pulling it in on the top of
my eyebrow so go see so for this look
I'm going to be using the tartlet
palette so to set I'm using the cream
like white shade I'll leave the shades
down below as well this just sets so
that I'm going in with a pinky like
peach tone so I'm using this for my
crease color because I didn't want to
use a super brown color for this because
it is gonna be you know kind of pink and
balance a fish so then I'm going in with
a more brown tone just to put slightly
in the crease just because I didn't want
to deepen it too much it was accessible
to be bright and pink but I'm also not a
very like right eye shadow type of
person so of course I kept it matte and
used some Brown something I'm blending
that all together
and then I'm gonna be going in with a
light shade and I'm going to be putting
these two shades and the center like of
my ID on the center in the corner of my
eye
they look really white chose me I'm
blinking out so I'm just blending brush
and I'm gonna mix those together so to
kind of like make this look all more
Valentine's Day ish I'm taking this Mac
pigment and this is like a rose macro
pigment and I am spraying some fix+ on
my brush and I am just going placing
this in the center of my eyelid and I
know it looks so so pink here but trust
me once I blend everything out
it doesn't like show that much because
I'm really not into like super super
pink eyeshadow so yeah I just put that
consider and then I close it out
now I'm wiping away the rest of my power
all of my face set everything and then
I'm gonna contour with my Kat Von D
contouring shade and light palette and
I'm just putting this in the center of
my cheeks and then I'm going in with a
different way fluffy brush to put hoola
bronzer just like all over my face and
this just like makes for a much more
bronzed look and it also like doesn't
make a harsh line on my face where I
just put the other contour now for blush
I'm using this NARS blush and it's just
a really pretty shade I think it's
perfect round today so I'm putting that
on the apples of my cheeks and then for
my favorite part I am highlighting so I
am so over highlighting my face for the
suck I'm just really into a right now so
I move my nose it's up my nose on my
forehead and then obviously like
focusing it right on my cheeks and then
I did my eyeliner off-camera and I'm
going to be applying false lashes so
there they are now onto the best part
the lips so I'm taking this glam glow
like lip plumper and I just bought this
and I really really like it so I'm just
applying this to my lips of where I put
my lipstick and lip liner and all that
on because it needs the bigger I guess
and then I'm using my spice lip liner
and I am lining my lips and guess it's
okay to kind of overrun them a little
bit you're going on about size 8
so now on top of that I'm going with my
revlon matte lipstick lip gloss
it's called and I absolutely love this
so this is the first lip look and I'm
obsessed with it guys is probably my
favorite shade for the second look look
I'm going back in with my spice lip
liner I use this a lot so I'm just
lining my lips lightly and then I'm
going in with this Too Faced melted
gloss I'll leave the color and get it
down below but this is for a more like
brown shade this is not a very impatient
which I really really like if you guys
aren't into like super pink or let me
read shapes oh my like this they're all
kind of nude by this one's really broken
or this one it is a liquid lipstick so
I'm not using any lip liner and it is
just the Kat Von D with lipstick and
this is a super pink shade and because I
did the eyes a little bit more neutral
and not so like right in your face paint
I got this
a really good club color also with the
eyes so I love this if you're not into
super pink shades or are just for Pete
jeans I think this is perfect for the
last lip color you guys know I love this
I've mentioned it in my favorites video
so this is pure Hollywood by an
associate and I absolutely love this
shade I think it's probably my second
favorite next to the first one I showed
you guys but this is just the perfect
nude pink it's not even like nude it's
just like the prettiest like baby pink
I don't know I'm obsessed with it so
this is my last lip look and I hope you
guys liked it so yeah I love this look
and if you guys liked it don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe or and
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
