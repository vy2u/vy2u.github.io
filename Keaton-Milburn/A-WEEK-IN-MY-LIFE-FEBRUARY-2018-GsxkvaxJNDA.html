but you gotta be there for me too
now that that's over good morning guys
and welcome to another a week in my life
so I'm just going to be vlogging what
I'm doing this week
I am currently just getting ready I did
a little phase mess before I did my
makeup it is 8:00 10:00 in the morning
in my classes like 10:30 but I leave
here like 9:45 ish so I'm gonna do my
makeup and eat my breakfast I just made
some bagels and have my little coffee so
you guys were laughing at my morning
routine so I was taking so many pills
these are all my vitamins and then one
of them is the medicine that I have to
take right now cuz I'm still getting
over my struck throat from like last
week when I was in Miami so those are
all the pills and I take do I know if
they work or not I have no clue I picked
them because I think that they make me
feel better like in my mind but I don't
really know so if they actually do end
up like working for me I'll keep you
guys updated I'm going to cost out I was
gonna change but I really don't feel
like it so I'm wearing this huge t-shirt
and my leggings and vans and my
extensions are now so we're all good my
car
the window so when I go through the car
wash I have to hold a towel so that the
water doesn't come pouring through my
convertible top so just girly things
here
just adjust come on face I'm with Morgan
because this is just the daily routine
so dead I just took out this little
snack to eat after my class literally
college like it's fine I'll just eat
raisins and almonds and crackers and
cheese like you think the cheese is good
like should I not eat the cheese like
when did this inspire oh my god guys
this expired on January 27th oh well
okay the almonds and raisins don't
expire and the crackers in the chocolate
don't but like those hi guys I'm so
sorry I forgot my blog camera when I
went to work out which is super
important but doesn't matter cuz I'll be
there at 9:30 tomorrow anyway I'm about
to hop in the shower I'm not gonna take
my makeup off yet though because me and
Kelsey have a Power Hour to go to power
hours like when someone is turning 21
they have a party like from 11:00 to
12:00 so then like at midnight
everyone's like oh you're doing one so
we're going to go to that tonight I'm
not sure how much of it I'll vlog but
I'm gonna shower really quickly cuz I
have some old spray tan that needs to
come off and I just left the gym so like
I need to shower anyway but I'm gonna
come out with my makeup fun change now
it's only eight thirteen and we're not
leaving here to like literally 11 so I
don't know if I'm gonna make it I'm so
tired already I think your workout just
really wore me out but I'm eating a
little salad in this bowl and I have
some bread so I think this is all I'm
gonna be having for dinner
good morning so I didn't end up going to
the Power Hour last night because I was
just so exhausted and tired and it just
wasn't in the mood to go so I just took
all my makeup off and went to bed but
it's eight o'clock now and I have work
out at 9:30 I like to like wake my body
up before I go to work out so I like to
wake up at like 8:00 and they change my
coffee and I've already been shopping on
dope for like 30 minutes this is not
sponsored I literally like wake up in
the morning and online shop Ando
it's just easier so that's what I'm
doing before my workout you guys can
follow me on dota if you want you guys
can see what clothes I'm looking at cuz
I like favorite them and put them in
like little albums and severed whatever
they're called
this say do you love me I tell her only
partly I only love my bed and my mom say
goodbye be nice they love you they just
want to see more 7
okay so I'm home now and I'm giving you
guys a pro tip I am about to take a
shower after I eat my acai bowl but I
hate watching just my face mask off in
the sink and like the water goes
everywhere so I always put a face mask
on before I get in the shower so I'm
gonna get in the shower I could just
like wash it off on one it's so much
easier so today I used the Neutrogena
deep clean purifying purifying clay
cleanser mask it's also a face wash but
you can leave it on for 10 minutes it
could be a mask I'm not sponsored this
is not sponsored for all you people who
want to comment be like you don't even
use Neutrogena I literally use the
products like every single day so I'm
using this mask today and I'm gonna eat
my bowl and then I'm gonna take a shower
but I just thought I'd share with you if
you hate washing your face in the sink
like I do I don't like taking my mask
off in the sink put your mask on before
you in the shower and then it's so much
easier okay guys this lighting is not
ideal but I look like literal crap today
like I literally look so bad today
so I don't really care for you guys to
see me but I'm sitting in my car because
I just got out of my first class but I
have like an hour and a half in between
my actually you know only have an hour
and between my next class so I wouldn't
go get a sandwich from Starbucks but
they were all out of sandwiches let's go
to chick-fil-a and I got grilled chicken
nuggets and a sweet tea you know I'm
just trying to like watch what I eat and
stuff so I got the grilled nuggets but
low-key got a 12 count so it's fine
so as you guys just saw I just left
sign language and I am going home now
it is 5:40 normally that class doesn't
get out so 6:20 but we had like a sub
teacher today like he wasn't our real
teacher
and we convinced him that it was time to
leave so we got out of like 5:30 so I'm
going home now and then I have a dinner
tonight with NAT and my twin which I
don't know how to explain this but a
twin is like so like you know how NAT is
my big and my sorority I'm her little so
she has another little besides neither
my twin so like me and my twin Brian and
not are gonna go to dinner it's kind of
like confusing but whatever that's
what's happening tonight
here and she needs to take a teeth
whitening picture so I set up my ring
late for her and we're gonna be taking a
little Instagram pic my stomachs
growling so much good morning
