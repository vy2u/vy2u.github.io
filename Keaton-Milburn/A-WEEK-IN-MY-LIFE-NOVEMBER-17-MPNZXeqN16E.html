high school a little game tonight and
then write a story on it tonight and
some minute before 6:00 am so later on
I'm going to go do that it is Halloween
but I will not be going out because I
have lots to do I've so much homework
two stories to write so I'm going to be
eating my ramen and then go into my eyes
go blind
just left the volleyball game it's now 8
o'clock I got there at 6:30 so not too
bad I did a few interviews with coaches
and players and then I need to text a
few players and get interviews tonight
because I have to write two stories
tonight which I'm a really really
stressed about so I'm going to be going
to the library now and writing my
stories and crying while I just slowly
suffer I probably need to stop at
Starbucks and get coffee because I'm so
tired but yeah that's how my halloween
is going so yeah can I get a venti iced
caramel macchiato with extra caramel
I've been doing work for like hours and
hours it's currently 12:10 and it's
November November first so that's great
I stayed up all night I had two essays
to write they were due before 6 a.m. so
I wrote both of those at the library
like hardcore I also did some sign
language homework and now I'm going to
watch a YouTube video while I finish
eating my halo top ice cream this is the
chocolate-covered banana I honestly have
like nothing left of it which is why I
wanted to finish it tonight because I
feel like I deserve it it's Halloween
and I spent my entire night at the at
the library so I was like you know what
I need to just eat some ice cream and
then go to sleep so that's what I'm
gonna do so I'll see you guys tomorrow I
woke up this morning and my eye hurts so
bad my right eye and literally feels
like it's bruised and I was like I felt
this before I have felt this pain so I
realized to have a sky on my right eye I
see it I'm still doing my makeup though
so that's probably not smart but I
realized to have a sky so now I have to
wear my glasses the worst of the week I
just got white all over my face I'm just
so frustrated cuz I really like this
makeup and now I'm like do I need to
take a full face of makeup off it
literally says shake me on it and I
didn't shake it I just used it and now
my whole face is covered in white
speckles like I don't know does it wipe
it doesn't wipe off like a look at this
side guys I'm so upset I just spent like
45 minutes doing the full face of makeup
I decided that I am not feeling to you
today so my nose
this is like Christmas what I'm gonna
say you look at this we've got the
foaming cleanser the cleansing water the
waterproof cleansing water and then this
one purifies this is for oily skin and
this one's for all skin types because
it's below 80 degrees I made some hot
chocolate and I have whipped cream
there's Morgan over there laughing at me
because it's not really winter here but
you know what I'm pretending I can't get
this thing how do I oh god
hey guys I've changed into a huge
oversized t-shirt and I'm just wearing
some pajama shorts because I'm about to
go get a spray tan you know those days
when you're just like no matter what you
do you just don't feel cute you don't
fool yourself
that's how today is I think that's just
because I can't wear my contacts and I
just don't really like wearing my
glasses that much I'm look so so pale
and my hair is white and I don't like
when my hair is super white and I'm
super pale it's just like not a look for
me and I don't know I'm just not feeling
my best self and so I was like you know
what you need to go get a spray tan I
also think it's because I didn't go to
my workout yesterday because I had to
write my paper and I work out normally
every single day I work out Monday
Tuesday Thursday Friday
I don't do Wednesday's but I think
that's because I didn't go to workout
yesterday so I'm just feeling like super
gross and not myself and so I was like
you know what go get a spray tan you'll
wake up in the morning feeling a lot
better you'll be tanned and ready to go
so I'm gonna go to right now I'll show
you guys the aftermath I'm gonna be
really really Brown also the World
Series is on tonight it's actually
playing right now but I have to avoid a
spray tan
so ghosts rose we'll see who wins here
is my beautiful dinner I got it from a
chop shop it's just this place has good
healthy meals so that I got that in my
juice like I said I'm about to be
watching the Astros vs. Dodgers World
Series I think I click the Spanish
Channel though
everything's in Spanish so I'm gonna try
and find English version but yeah this

World Series

so excited like I wish you guys could
see me now I have goosebumps I am so
excited I'm watching like the postgame

amazing obviously but I'm just really
really excited for the Astros I love my
city I love being from Houston and I'm
just gonna cry also I know I'm really
really dark I haven't washed my spray
tan off I'm going to bed I'm gonna wash
it off in the morning okay good night

really hope that they have eggs in the
dining hall because I haven't had eggs
in like a month and I'm starving my
stomach is like growling so guys they
had eggs
I got rice sausage and eggs and fruit I
am so happy this is some gourmet
breakfast we ain't come here on the
shuttle
and
yeah excited for our quiz I was gonna
ask you so like if a coach if you're
interviewing the coach and they give you
a cliche like I just interviewed my well
coach and she said when our backs are
against the wall like she said that in
her quote is it bad to use quotes where
the coach is using a cliche like should
you just avoid it or what's very good
question is it usually we're on our way
home from class it's been a great day I
actually out such a great day because I
know my work this week I didn't have a
bad class yeah you have to get like a

as much of that as I can I have no idea
what I'm gonna wear cuz I feel like a
war on my outfits already but I guess
we'll see me and Lou
so I'm back from breakfast I'm changed
into comfy clothes and I honestly just
want to lay in bed all day actually
raining and it's just really cloudy
outside so it's one of those days where
I want to lay in bed the football game
is not till six o'clock tonight and I
think now it's gonna go so I'm probably
gonna go to the football game later on
but I've been dying to watch the demi
lovato
documentary which is actually on YouTube
it's like an hour long super high
quality so I think I'm just gonna lay in
bed for like an hour watch a documentary
I'd probably cry a little bit and then
I'm gonna like get up and do my makeup
and get ready for the game tonight so
yeah that's how many's go I feel like if
I didn't have music I don't know what I
would have update I made some steaming
hot food oh okay I didn't make anything
I microwaved it it's by what does it
even say on here all I know is that it's
made by smart ones like a smart meal so
with like white chicken quinoa brown
rice black beans corn that kind of thing
so this is gonna be my dinner for
tonight and then I'm probably gonna eat
some peach yogurt because I have that
too and I am just still watching
football so that's my night so because I
did nothing today I'm gonna be giving
you guys little haul the stuff I got
from Tiger mist so the first thing is
this bodysuit
it is a bodysuit it's super long it's
just all lace it is see-through
unfortunately I didn't really know that
when I ordered it but it's fine if
Edward this was like a jean jacket
basically I was thinking I could like
dress this up in the wintertime with
like a scarf and like a cute sweater I
thought this would be really pretty
and then I got this top I'd been wanting
like I love these crop like basic tanks
and this one I just thought was really
cute because I like black and red
together and I don't know the Dragons
looked keel this is cute I don't know
why it's this fire on it and it's all in
like little sequins it's a little tube
top I just thought this would be really
fun to style super cute and then for
some reason I really just needed a
neck this is all it is it's just a white
turtleneck you get the point that's
everything I got from Tiger miss just
thought I'd show you really quickly
super basic I just realized I got only
black and white things I also ordered a
bathing suit but it doesn't ship for a
while so yeah good morning it is Sunday
I am up and dressed to go to church I'm
again wearing my glasses they're getting
so annoying at this point in life this
is my little little outfit of the day

finished watching an episode of Friends
and I got some Dutch rose this morning
and I'm about to go pick up my friend
Ashley for church

doing some homework and I postmates some
food from raw sushi
honestly I've no idea what I got all I
know is that I really wanted these
lobster spring rolls so I got these and
then I ordered a chicken teriyaki like
bento box but I thought it was just like
chicken and rice
apparently it comes with like all of
this stuff I'm not gonna eat all of this
this is like a lot of stuff I'm so
confused I think this is way too much
for me like what is what is this chicken
and rice okay that's chicken rice but it
comes with like a bunch of other things
so I'm gonna eat this and watch football
