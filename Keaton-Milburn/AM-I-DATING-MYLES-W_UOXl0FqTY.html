to be a Q&amp;amp;A obviously I haven't done one
of these and so so wrong I wanted you
guys to ask me questions cuz I feel like
there are so many new subscribers on
this channel and I feel like I just need
to up you guys up you gay can I just
speak update you guys on my life and
like what's currently going on and stuff
so yeah let's just get right into it if
you have to pick who you would live with
would you live with Kylie or Kim I
definitely would Kylie I feel like she's
much more exciting she's always doing
something and Kim's a mob and like I
don't want to be around her kids like
they're really cute but how do you deal
with people saying joining a sorority
it's like paying for friends I know
that's like the number-one thing is
everyone's like oh my god I don't want
to pay for my friends and like that's
not what it is
obviously sororities do so much more we
have lent payments and community service
and there's so many things that we do
and obviously if you are a member of
something even like any other club like
you're going to have to pay a certain
fee so I don't think I'm paying to have
friends like I could still be paying to
be an alpha fee and Hopps your friends
if that makes sense like it's up to me
whether I make friends and my sorority
or not so I just feel like when people
say that you pay for your friends it
makes no sense
do you prefer black guys or white guys I
do not discriminate I like any type of
guy I always say I feel like I don't
have a type but the last three guys have
talked you up in black if that says
anything about my life how do you keep
your hair staying so blonde well people
as you can see I just got a dad
yesterday it wasn't just it wasn't like
this I tried to get it as silver as
possible and I wash my hair with purple
shampoo the brand is shimmer lights I
believe and it's a big purple model they
sell it at Sally's so that's how I keep
my hair really really blonde when it's
starting to like fade out what is your
biggest pet peeve I hate people who have
bad breath like I don't know why but
like if you have bad breath like that is
so gross to me like it's so distracting
our boys cuter in Arizona are Texas
definitely Arizona like I feel like
there's so many more like hot guys here
if that makes sense but like a lot of
them just aren't my type so it's like
they're attractive but like I'm not
attracted to
if that makes sense wow that's us where
in my life that is literally moving on
what is your normal Starbucks order I
always get a venti iced caramel
macchiato with extra caramel because I
have a sweet tooth but I also really
love coffee and I get a mint tea because
I want a lot of it
what's the riskiest thing you've ever
sent someone I don't think I've ever
likes to anything we're scammed never
like set nudes you know no I've never
said nudes before I feel like riskiest
thing is like normally if I'm like
really like heated on something or like
I'm annoyed with someone I like snap at
them and I'll say something that's like
probably like kinda rude like they might
take it the wrong way but like I'm never
like blatantly like risky I don't know
what perfume do you wear actually I wear
I'll show you I just got this my
birthday it's Gucci blue I think that's
like the fragrance of it and I keep it
in the box it's really really pretty and
it smells so good like I am not even
kidding actually my sister got me this
no yeah I'm really excited about excess
smells amazing
do you prefer a wrap or army I actually
really like R&amp;amp;B a lot and I feel like I
listen to more rap I don't know why it's
just like normally more of my mood but I
still like our be like a lot now this
question says is do you make money moves
obviously the douchiest thing a frat boy
has ever said to you so one time because
if you guys have been following my
children oh that I don't drink so like
normally when I go to frat parties frat
guys think that I'm drunk or they think
that I've like had a few drinks and like
I won't know what they're talking about
not be confused for like I malaria sleep
cuz then like so one time this guy like
came up to me and was like oh my god hey
and I was like hey how are you and like
I couldn't remember if I had met him
before like I was like oh my gosh she's
probably in a class of mine I don't know
I don't want to be rude so I just acted
like I knew him and I was like hey and
then he was like you don't remember me
and I was like no I'm sorry like I
actually don't remember he was like oh
my gosh well we ice met you at that
party a few weeks ago and then that's
when I realized like oh I he's talking
to the wrong person because I don't like
ever go out so I was like oh I have the
wrong person
like I'm so sorry he's like no no no
like I'm pretty sure it was you like you
don't remember that night like you don't
remember me like Bauval like getting
like close so dim you know like no like
I I don't know what you're talking but I
think you have the wrong girl and he was
like no no um and we have class together
and I was like what class do we have
together because then I could tell he
was just like lying and he was like
philosophy you know I was like no I'm
not in that class and he was like I'm
sorry like I was honestly just trying
but hi my name is whatever and I was
like you're so stupid
did you think I was gonna be like oh my
god yeah I remember that night and then
like go home with you again like no I
don't know who you are
it was so that was like the dude she's
thinking guys ever said to me it's like
they thought that I was so drunk that I
was gonna like believe that I knew them
before it was so weird it was so awkward
where is a choker you always wear from I
don't know if it's this choker that
you're talking about but this one is
from urban and I wear it like every
single day and then this is from brandy
in case you guys are wondering when did
you lose your virginity I never lost it
it's still here happy at home with me if
I get one more question about if I'm
dating miles or not can you guys hop out
of my inbox please oh this one says when
you and miles get married can I be the
officiant Joel Osteen can be the flower
girl no no you cannot a lot of these
questions are like why did you and your
last ex break up and like honestly I
have no problem like telling that story
on the internet and I have no problem
like sharing it with you guys
but I don't like talk to him anymore and
I feel like that would be really really
rude of me and to like to put all of our
business out there without like asking
him or like getting his permission and
like I really don't feel like doing that
so that's why I never answered the
questions about my ex coz like we don't
really talk anymore and I don't want to
brand only like bring it up on the video
and then he's gonna be like wait what
you talk about that in a video I'm gonna
be like I don't know because everyone's
been asking me about it I might as well
just say but so yeah in case you guys
are wondering why I never answer my
questions cuz I don't have his like
permission I don't want to be rude I
don't want to put his business out there
it's his business - what is your ideal
date honestly honestly at my car DB
schmuck
it my ideal date
probably via nowhere like fancy no we're
like super trashy I mean you could take
me to McDonald's but like I would kind
of have to know you before you take me
and also you took me McDonald's on the
first day I'm obviously gonna be like
wait why um but like a first day it
would be like we could like just go to
Chipotle and like I don't like the
movies because you can't talk at the
movies and like then why did you take me
on a date it's like we're not gonna talk
we're just gonna sit there watch the
movie so I'll probably like Chipotle or
something and like something super
casual we could like go to the mall like
I don't know like bonding things have
you met any celebrities and if so who um
the first person I can - Cody Simpson I
met Cody Simpson like a long time ago in
this past year I've met like Trey Songz
and Odell Beckham and like stuff like
that so that's pretty cool that's
interesting your favorite concert
experience my favorite concert
experience has to be Coachella I'm
counting that in total as my favorite
concert experience but I also really
loves the Rihanna concert actually okay
I take back Coachella the Rihanna
concert I am not joking like me and
Hallie talked about it like at least
like once a month about how it changed
our lives like I'm not kidding it was
almost like a year ago and like that
concert for some reason the feeling I
had that when I left had me so mind
blown and like so in love with her that
I don't even know like where my mind was
at do you have any problems with people
in the YouTube community no I really
don't have problems with the YouTube
community at all if you like me that's
um not in the YouTube community no but
like legitimately I feel like I just
like to do YouTube because I like love
YouTube like it obviously is like
partially my job and stuff but I feel
like because I'm like one of like very
few youtubers who is like fully in
college and fully in a sorority and like
actually like doing so many other things
and I don't live in LA so like I feel
like that's why I don't have like
YouTube beef with anyone like there's no
one I would ever argue with I love
youtubers and I love following drama
channels I love seeing everyone else
but like I'm not in anything because
like Who am I you know that is all the
