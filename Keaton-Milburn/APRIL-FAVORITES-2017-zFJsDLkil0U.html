keep Liam iron the viewfinder freezes
really massive so let's get expensive
products in the month so the first
product is a keel scrap and this is the
keels creamy eye treatment with avocado
which I just think it's like really cute
difficult greenish yellow eye cream have
been using this for the past few months
and I've never ever used an eye cream
before and shall use this eye cream and
I'm absolutely a little bit like I don't
think I could ever go back to not using
an eye cream and I really didn't find a
problem with my under eyes or anything
but I just really really like this also
cancel doing something really cool right
now where if you guys bring in any empty
q bottle jar or tube into the akhil
store they are donating one dollar for
each up to $15,000 to recycle across
america which i think is amazing and
also saturday is Earth Day and so if you
guys are hash tagging any of your
Kiehl's and sees like your jars your
juice anything like that i'm hashtag
eels Earth Day and they are also
donating a dollar for your incentives
that you guys are posting on Instagram
so tag Kiehl's and your MPs on Instagram
and to think that's really really
awesome that they're donating this to
recycle across America because I love
the Kiehl's brand I love what they stand
for and I just think that's really
exciting so yeah the next request our
beauty products the first one is this
becca bronzer and oh look Lula Capri is
literally so pretty just officiate a
Panama Sun I'm not really sure to say
that but there's six I held applied
again there's six shades of their new
bronzers and they're so so pretty have
all been because a lot of them you can
use a new lighter this is the darkest
shade I believe that they have but
they're just really really pretty I have
to spend using this I use this everyday
at Coachella because I have a
with Brady ins on I was super dark and
needed a really really dark bronzer also
if you guys want to see my get ready
with me at Coachella you guys absolutely
loves my get ready with me I'm so so
happy that you guys like them like
seriously made me so happy that you guys
like to watch them so I almost all three
of them down below if you guys haven't
seen them yet but yeah I wish Coachella
and I wore this every single day I was
there and I just think it gave me the
perfect bronzy look the next one is a
makeup forever powder and I was actually
super surprised by this it's like this
yellow we might feel like the banana
powder that a lot of people use and I
just really really like this to set my
under eyes obviously that's commonly
what you would use oh my god I wanna
dropped again that's only what you would
use this color force you said your under
eyes it really helps brighten them and
so I've just been using this friend you
like it everyday makeup tutorial for the
most part I like to make my face but if
I'm doing like everyday kind of look
like I just used it today just like set
underneath my eyes to just easier it was
quick I didn't have to bake so yeah I've
just been loving this I want to know the
shade but it doesn't say like I don't
know the shades but there's like only
one of these so it we're the only house
in the shade
okay the next two things are food so
they're called whoa I don't know if any
of you guys have ever had these before
they're literally empty like they're
completely empty but I saved them so I
could show you guys because I am
obsessed with these my X movies all the
freaking time because I don't know where
to get them so she's always like sense
them to me or bite them and get them to
me and I loved it so this is the peanut
butter grand slam okay grams them
because it's like you know like a grip
okay and this one is the jamon
strawberry shortbread and I don't know I
just absolutely love used to snack on
throughout the day I don't know why I
just think they're really really good
and I'm just a success I really started
therapy because I don't know where to go
get them
but I am in love with them and I've been
like obsessed in this whole one my next
few favorites are two TV shows will
Netflix shows I have been watching so
the first one is obviously 13 reasons
and I read the book book a few years ago
and was obsessed with the book I had no
idea they're making a series and I think
that
they did an amazing amazing job on the
series like seriously I like I'm going
to do stuff like guys I'm getting
goosebumps talking about it because that
show I feel like for some reasons it's
like meant so much to me because what
like reading the book it really did like
impact me and it really makes you think
about things if you guys haven't seen
there in reasons I don't know where
you've been it's been all over social
media
no we're not doing this practice but
yeah if you guys have it 213 reasons I
hired how to suggest that you guys
probably know what it's about it's a bit
like a like a heavy subject is about
suicide and all that kind of stuff but
it is so so good and I highly highly
recommend pain the second shelf that I
want to talk about is shameless so I'm
actually on season three of shameless I
believe I started a while ago but I'm
like slowly watching it I took a break
on watching shameless so I could finish
a 13 reasons a lot but I'm obsessed with
shameless I now see why everyone loves
the show so much I'm so emotionally
attached to all the kids and I just like
welded some with you guys haven't seen
shameless I do suggest it is a bit like
graphic here in there if you guys watch
the show you know what I mean but if
there is much for some people who like
aren't used to that but it's really
really good
so that is it for my favorites video I
hope you guys like this video good are
you welcome

watching Co because I got so many
comments on my last I get ready with me
