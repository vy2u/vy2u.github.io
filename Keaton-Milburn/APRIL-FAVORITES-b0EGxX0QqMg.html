really don't know how I'm feeling about
it it just was kind of sick of my old
spot I also look really really pale I
don't know why I decide to wear a white
shirt I bought this shirt from brandy
melville like four months ago and I've
never worn it and so I figured I would
wear it and you can't even see it so
good job what's up guys today's video is
going to be another favorites video and
I have just had like one of the most
jam-packed months like ever and isn't
seem like that to you guys because I
know this month has been kind of slow
for posting and everything and that's
basically just because school has taken
over my entire life being in school and
filming YouTube videos is such a
struggle and I'm not trying to complain
it's just kind of difficult I have my
SAT on Saturday so pray for me I am
stressing enough about that I'm gonna
get into the favorites
so the first favorite I'm gonna be
talking to you guys about is a perfume
and like I know you guys probably like
what the heck eaten like you never
talked about this I never want to talk
about my perfumes I think I did in one
of my older videos but I used to always
wear a tree full of juicy like every
single day from juicy and I would wear
it every single day like that is my
go-to perfume that or Marc Jacobs and I
ran out of both of them like I'm
literally out of both of them so I was
just kind of like in the middle like
wearing like pink perfumes and all that
kind of stuff not that they're not good
so this month I said to test out a
website and the website is called sit
burn calm and basically it is a website
that just has a bunch of perfumes and
you go on the website you take a test
and it tells you like ask you certain
questions about fragrances you like or
like colors and stuff like that just to
get an idea and then it gives you like a
bunch of perfumes choose from so you can
pick a perfume and so I took the test
online and I got um let me see what mine
is called gone lovest Bell I don't know
I don't know how to pronounce things but
it smells like the greatest oh my gosh
the this perfume that came into my life
is the best smelling perfume so been
like choking because it was bright
much of it I just like one all on me but
anyway the website is called sin bird
and you can pay 14.95 to get a
subscription of a fragrance that last
you 30 days so ask you the whole month
and the next month to get another one
and it comes in a little bottle like
this and guys like this is a good supply
for feet like it's not like a little
sample that gets for like it's a good
supply perfume and the perfumes aren't
like crazy like cheap little perfumes
like they have they have people a juicy
on there
they have lancome and work jacobs they
have so many they have Christian Dior
they have Burberry on there so many nice
perfumes and you can pay 14.95 and get a
subscription every single month and I
just think it's one of the coolest
things it's like kind of like I think
you can do stuff like this with like
clothes and beauty but like perfume
especially I love trying to switch up my
perfumes like I love that and so this
website has really just like oh ok oh I
love being able to try out new things
they're not just sticking with the same
thing so being able to go on there and
like take a test and see which one's fit
me I really love that so this website
this month has really been a blessing
because this perfume guys if you check
you guys need to go take the test and
then if Lancome whatever this is the
name of this is whichever one this is
you have to pick it it smells so good
and I actually have a coupon code for
you so you guys can use the coupon code
Keeton 25 to get 25 percent off your
first month subscription so definitely
go check it out I believe it all down
below another beauty product that I've
been loving this month is the Naked 2
Urban Decay palette and this has been
out for quite some time it's not like a
new like palette but I really have been
wanting to try out more of the naked
palettes I have the Naked 1 palette and
that's like my ultimate like all-time
favorite one but I've really been
wanting to try out the other two and
others 2 and 3 so whoa it's like pop
this open but this is what it looks like
these are like all the
see these are the colors in it and
they're basically all shimmery like
they're all super shimmery colors and
they're more like on the pink side like
the naked 1 palette has a lot of
neutrals and stuff but this one has like
more pinks and I really really love that
and then I really don't have a lot of
shimmery colors I've been loving this
this month I think my favorite would
have to be the snakebite color because I
like putting that like on top of more my
creases and then I also like using
booty-call to highlight that's the last
beauty product I have to share with you
guys is the covergirl lash pass lash
back for that covergirl LashBlast Volume
Mascara and I absolutely love this I
would have never actually tried this but
I got this in my Easter basket the one
day I was like wearing like little
makeup and I was like you know what
let's just try out this mascara and it
worked so good I love the brush if I can
get it open oh my gosh I love the brush
because I'm so used to the what is it
the benefit mascara that I use I forgot
the name of it um but the brush on this
is like so nice and so different it's
like shorter and I don't know I really
really like this and it's just simple
and I like wearing it with like less
makeup than I'd normally wear why is
making someone so I really love this I
was gonna do a clothing like I was gonna
pick a few clothing favorites for this
month but then I realized I just did an
urban outfitters Anna brandy melville
like collective haul and basically
everything in that video has been my
favorite this month but something I
didn't mention in the video was a
bathing suit that I got that I got from
triangle so I'm gonna show you guys this
and okay let me show you guys the top
first oh my gosh guys I'm obsessed so
this is what it looks like it's like
they look like little melons
so this is what it looks like I'm f guys
can tell but it's really shiny and it's
rose gold which I just I really love
rose gold and then this is our super
Coralie color and I have been wearing
this and this is the only bathing suit
that I tan it now and it it fits me
perfectly which is really hard to do
when you're buying try go bathing suits
and especially online trying to buy
bathing suits like that's the biggest
struggle but this fits me so perfect and
then the bottoms look like this
they're so cute I really love these only
thing that I don't like is that the
material is neoprene and so it wrinkles
so easily and they say that like on the
website and everything so that's the
only thing I don't like I think I'm
gonna probably end up wearing just
regular black bottoms with the top but I
really love these I just wish that they
didn't wrinkle so easily um everything
else it's just this has been my favorite
so the last favor side of my shirt you
guys are obviously music I love sharing
my music with you guys just because I
don't know I feel like beauty it's just
like everyone has this and if you like
everyone's music taste is so different
and so I really like sharing the music
taste with you guys I don't know why I'm
telling you that I'm just trying to give
a reason why I want to talk about music
okay so the first artist that I've been
loving this month is kid astray and I've
listened to them before and I I mean
I've always loved a few of their songs
I've never been like a hardcore like fan
or anything but I listen to a few of
their songs and I like absolutely love
them and then I followed them on south
loud and they reposted the East
Hollywood EP by Marquis Macy or boss
Basie bassy I don't really know um but
they reposted it and I was like this is
the best album ever I absolutely love
this so the East Hollywood EP and 2-8-2
am club like I've absolutely been loving
them another artist that I've been
loving this month is Big Sean and I know
you guys probably don't know that like I
listened to Big Sean or I don't know
that might be weird to you some of you
guys but I absolutely love Big Sean and
can we just talk about him and ariana
grande breaking up
like really literally when I found out I
was like I don't really know what to do
with myself like I don't know if I
should be upset because they broke up
and like they're my goals or if I should
just be like really happy because now
Big Sean and me getting together and
then now for just a song that I've been
loving is want you to want me by Jason
Derulo and if you guys haven't heard
that song go listen to it it makes you
like wanna dance in the car it's like
how sugar was for me like a few months
ago whatever that song makes me so happy
and I feel like every single song that
Jason Derulo comes out with it's like on
the radio on repeat and I really don't
ever get sick of it I just really love
it so that song has definitely been my
favorite too so that's basically it for
this month's favorites I hope you guys

videos this month but I really want to
pick it up and start more spring videos
going into the next month so stay tuned

bit of it I can't even talk to it oh my
