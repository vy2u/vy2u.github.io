really don't know how I'm feeling about
it I just was kind of sick of my old
slot I also look really really pale I
don't know why decide to wear a white
shirt I bought this shirt from brandy
melville like four months ago and I've
never worn it and so I figured out where
it and you can't even see its own good
job what's up guys today's video is
going to be another favorites video and
I have just had like one of the most
jam-packed months like ever and it
seemed like that to you guys because I
know this month has been kind of slow
for posting and everything and that's
basically just because school has taken
over my entire life being in school and
filming youtube videos is such a
struggle and I'm not trying to complain
it's just kind of difficult i have my sh
t on saturday so pray for me i am
stressing enough about that i'm going to
get into the favorites so the first
server i'm going to be talking you guys
about is a perfume and like I know you
guys probably like what the heck keaton
like we never talk about this I never
want to talk about my perfumes i think i
did in one of my older videos but I used
to always wear at viva la juicy like
every single day from juicy and I would
wear it every single day like that is my
go-to perfume that or marc jacobs and i
ran out of both of them like I'm
literally out of both of them so I was
just kind of like in the middle like
wearing like ping perfumes and all that
kind of stuff not that they're not good
so this month I've said to test out a
website and the website is called sit
Berg calm and basically it is a website
that just has a bunch of perfumes and
you go on the website you take a test
and it tells you like ask you certain
questions about fragrances you like or
like colors and stuff like that just to
get an idea and then it gives you like a
bunch of perfumes choose from so you can
pick a perfume and so I took the test
online and I got um let me see what mine
is called gone lovest Bell I don't know
I don't want to pronounce things but it
smells like the greatest oh my gosh the
this perfume that came into my life is
the best smelling perfume so I'm like
choking because it was Frank's much of
it I just like one all on me but anyway
the website is called sin bird and you
can pay for 295 to get a subscription of
a fragrance that last you 30 days so I
see the whole month and the next one to
get another one and it comes in a little
bottle like this and guys like this is a
good supply perfume like it's not like a
little sample that good it's for like
it's a good supply perfume and the
perfumes aren't like crazy like cheap
little perfumes like they have that
people ahjussi on there they have
lancome and marc jacobs they have so
many they have christian dior they have
burberry on there so many nice perfumes
and you can pay for 295 and get a
subscription every single month and it's
I just think it's one of the coolest
things it's like kind of like I think
you can do stuff like this with like
clothes and beauty but like perfume
especially I love trying to switch up my
perfumes like I love that and so this
website has really just like oh okay oh
I love being able to try out new things
they're not just sticking with the same
thing so being able to go on there and
like take a test and see which ones fit
me I really love that so this website
this month has really been a blessing
because this perfume guys if you tick
you guys need to go take the test and
then if Lancome whatever this is the
name of this is whichever one this is
you have to pick it it smells so good
and I actually have a coupon code for
you so you guys can use the coupon code
key 25 to get twenty-five percent off
your first month subscription so
definitely go check it out I believe it
all down below another beauty product
that i've been loving this month is the
naked to Urban Decay palette and this
has been out for quite some time it's
not like a new like palette but I really
have been wanting to try out more of the
naked palettes I have the naked one
palette and that's like my ultimate like
all time favorite one but I've really
been wanting to try out the other two
and others two and three so whoa it's
like pop this open but this is what it
looks like these are like all that
see these are the colors in it and
they're basically all shimmery like
they're all super shimmery colors and
they're more like on the pink side like
the naked one palette has a lot of
neutrals and stuff but this one has like
more pinks and I really really love that
and then I really don't have a lot of
shimmery colors I've been loving this
this month I think my favorite would
have to be the snakebite color because I
like putting that like on top of more my
creases and then I also like using booty
call to highlight that's the last beauty
product I have to share with you guys is
the covergirl lash bass lash back for
that plan covergirl LashBlast volume
mascara and I absolutely love this I
would have never actually tried this but
I got this in my Easter basket one day I
was like wearing like little makeup and
I was like you know what let's just try
out this mascara and it works so good i
love the brush if i can get it open up
gosh i love the brush because I'm so
used to the what is it the benefit
mascara that i use i forgot the name of
it um but the brush on this is like so
nice and so different it's like shorter
and I don't know I really really like
this and it's just simple and I like
wearing it with like less makeup that I
normally wear why is my phone going on
so I really love this I was gonna do a
clothing like I was gonna pick a few
clothing favorites for this month but
then I realized I just did an urban
outfitters and a brandy melville like
collective haul and basically everything
in that video has been my favorite this
month but something I didn't mention in
the video was a bathing suit that I got
that i got from triangle so i'm going to
show you guys this and ok let me show
you guys the top first oh my gosh guys
i'm obsessed so this is what it looks
like it's like they look like little
melons cute so this is what it looks
like i'm f guys can tell but it's really
shiny and it's rose gold which I just I
really love rose gold and then this is
our super Coralie color and I have been
wearing this
this is the only bathing suit that I tan
it now and it it fits me perfectly which
is really hard to do when you're buying
triangle bathing suits and especially
online trying to buy bathing suits like
that's the biggest struggle but this
fits me so perfect and then the bottoms
look like this they're so cute I I
really love these only thing that I
don't like is that the material is a
neoprene and so it wrinkles so easily
and they say that like on the website
and everything um so that's the only
thing I don't like I think I'm gonna
probably end up wearing just regular
black bottoms at the top but I really
love these I just wish that they can
wrinkle so easily of everything else
it's just this has been my favorite so
the last favor sign my shirt the guys
are obviously music I love sharing my
music with you guys just because I don't
know I feel like beauty it's just like
everyone has this and if you like
everyone's music taste is so different
and so I really like sharing the music
taste with you guys I don't know why I'm
telling you that I'm just trying to give
a reason why I wanted that about music
ok so the first artist that I've been
loving this month is kid astray and I've
listened to them before and I I mean
I've always loved a few of their songs
I've never been like a hardcore like fan
or anything but I also do a few other
songs I like absolutely love them and
then I followed them on South loud and
they reposted the East Hollywood EP by
Marquis may see your boss Basie baci I
don't really know but they reposted it
and I was like this is the best album
ever I absolutely love this so the East
Hollywood EP and 28 2 a.m. club like
I've absolutely been loving them another
artist that I've been loving this month
is Big Sean and I know you guys probably
don't know that like I listen to Big
Sean or I don't know that my paper do
some of you guys but I absolutely love
big sean and can we just talk about him
and ariana grande breaking up like
really literally when I found out I was
like I don't really know what to do with
myself like I don't know if I should be
upset because they broke up and like
they're my goals or if I should just be
like really happy because now Big Sean
and
you can be together and then now for
just a song that I've been loving is
want you to want me by jason derulo and
you guys haven't heard that song go
listen to it it makes you like wanna
dance in the car it's like how sugar was
for me like a few months ago whatever
that song makes me so happy and I feel
like every single song that Jason Derulo
comes out with is like on the radio on
repeat and I really don't ever get sick
of it i just really love it so that song
has definitely been my favorite too so
that's basically it for this month's
favorites i hope you guys like this

slow on videos this month but i really
want to pick it up and start more spring
