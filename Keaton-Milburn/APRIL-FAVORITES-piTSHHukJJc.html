to be April favorites and I know I just
uploaded a March favorites so you guys
will probably like I'm keeping you only
uploaded one video in the month of like
April that was not a favorites video
listen I really suck at life right now
and not good I suck at life I suck at
like ideas right now and I'm really
struggling with video ideas and I don't
want to just like film something that
makes absolutely no sense that put it up
because like who wants to watch that no
one so I actually actually guys on my
snapchat and I snapped a ton of you guys
back you guys give me like so many ideas
and I'm actually gonna film two more
videos this week so I can might get back
into the hang of filming for you guys I
just like have real evidence right and I
just been like sucking someone is
drilling something on my house I don't
know I've been sucking at videos lately
and I know I know but I'm going to be
filming a makeup tutorial this week and
then another outfits video I believe so
stay tuned for that I'm sorry guys I
suck um but this is my favourites of
April I don't have that many like every
month but I'm gonna just show you guys
okay I'm also really into cactus right
now not really but okay so my first
favorite is definitely the Kylie lip kit
gloss and this isn't so cute and I know
like everyone's like some people are
gonna be like oh my god it's not even
that good you just making that up
honestly I don't really um I mean like I
like glosses but I only use like the
same one every single time and I
actually have like and literally the
gloss but I really like so cute because
it is the lightest shade and abed put it
in like the center like my lips
it makes them bigger I'm gonna be doing
a video on like all the Kylie stuff
because I have lip kits coming in as
well but the only thing I would say
about this is my lips are really really
really dry and they absorb lip gloss so
quickly so it's always really hard for
me to find the gloss that like stays on
so I mean my I mean this stays on a lot
longer than my other glasses but it's
still like absorbs it and it kinda
goes away but I know it isn't really
matter to me because I love the color um
the other thing I can't remember if I
mentioned but this is Mac honey love and
I just bought this I probably already
talked about it but I really really love
this and it's just like the perfect
it'll like nude and so I used spice lip
liner which is you guys know it's my
go-to I put honey love in the center and
the neck looks so cute over and it just
oh my god it looks amazing if you guys
have been commenting on like my
Instagram pictures this is what I've
been wearing like that's a little combo
been wearing all month I should just
include it all three of them together
but that is what I've been wearing all
month and every single day I'm wearing
it all today
next are fake eyelashes and seriously
guys I do not like thick eyelashes it
like I can never put them on correctly I
suck
I literally suck at life without fake
eyelashes but these are the ardell
lashes in 110 and these are my favorite
lashes like ever like the number I love
like this kind of lash whatever I don't
even know what I'm saying but I love
this obviously I've used like most of
the packaging but I just feel like they
look the most like they're I think their
flavor or what I don't know but they
look natural but they still look
dramatic enough to where like it's
enough you know so I absolutely love
these I'm wearing with a lot away on my
playlist and like everyone was like oh
you're gorgeous look so glad okay the
last thing that's just like random these
are all just random but the last thing
are these sunglasses and these oh my
gosh you guys okay anyway look like
ASEAN foreign but I love these
sunglasses just because they're kind of
like rose gold and they have like pink
reflects in them and I got them at Urban
Outfitters
thank you guys follow my thumb up snap I
kind of like hauled a bunch of things
from Urban Outfitters but tell me what
you guys think about me doing a try on
haul with um like all the clothes I just
recently picked up I know I showed some
you guys then if you follow my public
snap but not everyone saw them so if you
guys want to see a try on haul that
would be good too let me know and the
last thing are these jeans
guys I never really like talked about
jeans I just I've work I've won
pair of jeans for like three years like
I don't really repurchase Jean things
like I've had the same pair of shorts
for like literally four years like I
wear them every single day and I've had
them for four years I never rebuy Jean
stuff but I will read I will repurchase
season every color so these are the
Jeannie jeans from Topshop and I posted
a picture in them I want them to just be
for concert and everyone was company was
like oh my god your jeans are so cute
and I never really get comments on jeans
except for when I wear these they have
no no they have little like grips and
then here whatever I'm not probably
behind on this trend and everyone owns
these jeans but I just bought them
because I realized you know what keeping
like your jeans are so raggedy you need
new ones and so I bought these and I
also welcome black so I'm obsessed with
them and I literally wear them like
every single day disgusting I don't so
that's all like the random objects I
have for this month so now I'm gonna get
into the music you guys know every month
I make a playlist on my Spotify that has
my favorites so my April favorites um
playlist has been kind of like all over
the place
only because some music I've been
listening to the past few months but it
just got on Spotify so like Kanye's
album is like just on Spotify so I just
added it in there so my favorites right
now would have to be famous waves FML
and real friends by Kanye West or
whatever I put those in that album and
then I also really like 2088 which is
you guys know that Jones literally my
favorite rapper I I live for Big Sean
any song he has like I literally die so
my favorites from that album would be
like memories faded deja vu and I like
London Bridge there's other ones I like
but those are like ones I can actually
like jam to so I put them in that and
then also let's see oh I don't know why
I don't even talked about this first
Buse scope I'm not even going to say
anything about views by Drake but um
it's just if you guys haven't heard it
just go get it it's on iTunes Amazon
Spotify yet Spotify what are you doing
because
put it on Spotify so I can have it in my
freakin playlist but views us literally
the most amazing album I love every
single song and there's 20 songs which
is just like really so music amazing I
have yet to buy lemonade and I've
listened to a few songs but have you had
to buy it because my phone says I have
no storage so whatever Apple like get it
together but that's all like the music
I've liked for this month I just I know
I'm in there's a lot of really really
good music right now so if you guys want
to go click on my Spotify and check it
out that would be great thank you guys

staying like with me when I have like
not posted any videos this whole month I
seriously like I suck and it's not that

what I'm filming like I just need better
ideas of what I want to put out but

life so much better also one of my
favorites this month has definitely been
