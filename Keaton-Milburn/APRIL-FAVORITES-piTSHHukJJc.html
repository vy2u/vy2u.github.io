to buy April favorites and i know i just
uploaded a merch David so you guys will
probably like I'm keeping the only
uploaded one video in the month of like
April that was not a favorites video
listen I really suck at life right now
and not good i suck at life i suck it
like ideas right now and i'm really
struggling with video ideas and i don't
want to just like film something that
makes absolutely no sense that put it up
because like who wants to watch that no
one so i actually actually guys on my
snapchat and I snapped a ton of you guys
back you guys give me like so many ideas
and I'm actually going to film two more
videos this week um so I can might get
back into the hang of filming for you
guys I just like have really evident and
I just been like sucking someone is
drilling something my house I don't know
I've been sucking at videos lately and I
know I know but I'm going to be filming
a makeup tutorial this week and then
another outfits video i believe so stay
tuned for that sorry guys i suck um but
this is my favorites of april i don't
have that many like every month but i'm
going to show you guys okay i'm also
really handy cactus right now not really
but okay so my first favorite is
definitely the Kylie lip kit gloss and
this isn't so cute and I know like
everyone's like some people are gonna be
like oh my god it's not even that good
you just making that up honestly I don't
really um I mean like I like glosses but
i only used like the same one every
single time and i actually have like and
literally the gloss but i really like so
cute because it is the lightest shade
and a bed pudding and like the center of
like my lips it makes them bigger i'm
going to be doing a video on like all
the Kylie's stuff because I have look
it's coming in as well but the only
thing I would say about this is
are really really really dry and they
absorb lip gloss so quickly so it's
always really hard for me to find a
gloss that like stays on so I mean my I
mean this stays on a lot longer than my
other glasses but it's still like
absorbs it and it kind of goes away but
I don't know it is really matter to me
because I love the color um the other
thing I can't remember if I mentioned
but this is Mac honey love and I just
bought this I probably already talked
about it but I really really love this
and it's just like the perfect it'll
like nude and so I used spice up liner
which is you guys know my go-to I put
honey love in the center and then I put
so cute over and it just oh my god it
looks amazing if you guys have been
commenting on like my Instagram pictures
this is what I've been wearing like
that's a little combo been wearing all
month I should just include it all three
of them together but that is what I've
been wearing all month and every single
day I'm wearing at all today next are
fake eyelashes and seriously guys I do
not like the eyelashes it like I can
never put them on quickly I suck I
literally suck at life without fake
eyelashes but these are the ardell
lashes in 110 and these are my favorite
lashes like ever out like the number i
love like this kind of lash whatever I
don't even know what I'm saying but I
love this obviously I'm used like most
of the packaging but I just feel like
they look the most like there I think
they're off their flavor or what I don't
know but they look natural but they
still look dramatic enough to where like
it's enough you know so I absolutely
love these I'm wearing with a lot away
my playlist and like everyone was like
oh you're no just looks so good
something okay the last thing that's
just like random these are all just
random but the last thing are these
sunglasses and these oh my gosh you guys
I'm literally living for these ok anyway
like ozzy osbourne's but i love these
sunglasses just because they're kind of
like rose gold and I have like pink
reflects in them and i got them at Urban
Outfitters thank you guys follow my
public snap i kind of like hauled a
bunch of things from Urban Outfitters
but tell me what you guys think about me
doing a try on haul with like all the
clothes i just recently picked up i know
i showed some you guys then if you
follow that public snap but not everyone
saw them
if you guys want to see a try on haul
that would be good to let me know and
the last thing I these jeans guys I
never really like talked about jeans I
just I've work I've won the same pair of
jeans for like three years like I don't
really repurchase Jean things like I've
had the same pair of shorts for like
literally for years like I wear them
every single day and I've had them for
four years I never read by Jean stuff
but i will read i will report your
season every color so these are the
genie jeans from Topshop and I posted a
picture in them I want them to just
Bieber concert and everyone was
comforting like oh my god your jeans are
so cute and I never really get comments
on jeans except for what i wore these
they have um no no they help little like
rips Anthony or whatever I know probably
behind on this trend in everyone else's
jeans but i just bought them because i
realize you know what keeping like your
jeans are so raggedy you need new ones
and so i bought these and i also bought
them black so I'm obsessed with them and
I literally wear them like every single
day disgusting I don't so that's all
like the random objects i have for this
month so now i'm going to get into the
music you guys know every month i make a
playlist on my spotify that has my
favorites so my april favorites um
playlist has been kind of like all over
the place only because some music I've
been listening to the past few months
but it just got on Spotify so like
kanye's album is like just on Spotify so
I just added it in there so my favorites

whatever I put those in that album and
then I also really like 2088 which is

favorite rapper I I live for Big Sean
