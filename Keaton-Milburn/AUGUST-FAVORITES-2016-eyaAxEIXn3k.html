this is so weird filming in my dorm I
feel like I have to be quiet because
like I think if I talk to blab like
everyone around me is gonna hear me so
this is so awkward like having a talk so
quietly I feel about this
anyway what's up guys so today's video
is going to be my August favorites and
this oh my god I came and like take
myself seriously filming this video okay
get it together Keenan um so for the
month of August as you guys know I have
officially moved this is my dorm I am in
college then I was so also just a
disclaimer before you guys start yelling
at me in the comments I am filming
College Q&amp;amp;A but I am waiting till after
about a month of me living here so I
could talk about a North you guys
because I feel like me going to college
for a week doesn't really like dictate
me being like this is how I feel about
College because I really haven't
experienced that much of it and I'm sure
my thoughts on College will change after
a while so I am waiting a few months
maybe just a month until I feel mic unit
anyway moving on I'm gonna talk to you
guys about the products I've been loving
this one so let's get into it the first
product I've been loving is the ultra
light cleansing oil by Neutrogena and
this takes off your makeup your
waterproof makeup dirt or oil anything
like that and I just really really love
this I use this also I ran out of my
bare minerals one that I always use and
I got this and I absolutely love it
it smells what is that it smells so good
guys like this literally smells amazing
I don't even know what's in this but oh
my god it smells so good it makes me
like so happy so wait for this
the next two items are from glam glow so
the first one is the super mud clearing
treatment and by the way this is not
sponsored these are my opinions but the
first one is more of like a tingling
kind of mess I don't know if it's like
supposed to tingle but like it does I
don't know it's just one of those mess
and makes your skin feel really clear
and like the way it dries I love it and
you'll even offer like five to twenty
minutes and then the second one is
actually my favorite I think just
because it's so cool but this is the
gravity mud firming treatment so this
tightens your skin and so it comes with
a little brush and you just apply the
mask all over your face you leave it on
for I believe twenty to thirty minutes
and then once you take it off it's one
that you can peel completely off your
face and I don't even know that the
feeling of taking this off your face
it's like so amazing I don't know why
it's just like aesthetically pleasing to
me aesthetic the up was that English I
look insane with it on like I literally
look like an alien but I love this pass
so much that's all like the beauty more
products this is makeup so the only
makeup product I have is this blush and
look how pretty it is like honestly I
don't know why I find this color so cool
ready but this is the corner Rosa or a
breath powder I don't even know but this
is by Sigma and Sigma Sabinas and like I
was just like oh and I really melted try
it out and it's my new favorite blush
like I wear this every single day every
occasion I don't know why I just think
it's so pretty and the last random
favorite for the month is our was that
Prop realistically are these glasses and
a lot of you guys gonna be like Keaton
you're so annoying and they have a bit
clearer on them because they're not
prescription which I have prescription
glasses because my eyesight is terrible
but I bought these just because I just
really think they're so cute like
honestly in the outfit I just put these
on and I just look like a cute little
like schoolgirl it's like out studying
not studying I don't know I think they
look really good at like the college
seeing you know like I look like I'm
like a student I don't know what I'm
saying
honey compliments also about them and
they're from Urban Outfitters like I
don't know where to link them because I
can't find them but they're from Urban
Outfitters if you guys are wondering
also if you're wondering where my choker
is from its from Sorella boutique and my
t-shirt is a Harley Davidson t-shirt so
special moving on that's not part of it
other favorite for the month would be my
tattoos so a lot of you guys have been
commenting on stuff like is that real
whatever yes it's real and me my mom and
my sister got any triangle on our wrist
and it's not like Illuminati I know a
lot of you guys are gonna be annoying
about that but it's not the Illuminati
it is the three sides of the triangle
make up me my mom my sister like one
isn't complete without the other kind of
thing like it's a triangle I don't know
I think it's a really cute idea we like
it I love it I thought about it before I
got it and I just really liked it and I
can't believe this is like the first of
many tattoos down the line but I'm just
kind of getting into it
anyway I'm so off topic right now but
those are my favorites for the month now
moving on to music every month you guys
might make a post on my Spotify you guys
go follow it links down below but my
favorite my favorite thing on this whole
playlist of my August favorites is murky
Basie's new EP witches amazing every
single time I'm in the car every single
time I have my headphones in I am
listening to this like EP like it's so
good I think my favorite would be last
one I loved and probably probably all of
them I don't even know what I'm saying
my other favorite would have to be let
me love you which has Justin Bieber in
it I used that on my last dorm tour
video and then also part of next door
came out with an album obviously like if
you haven't listened to it yet go listen
but I put only you and my August
favorites because I really like that one
also Tory Lanez came off the album and I
thought
Guns N'Roses and my August favorites
because I really like that song from it
but there's a ton of other music on here

playlist listed below if you guys want
to go listen to them I think my last
favorite of the month has to be my
favorite thing in the whole entire world

used to watch new girl all the time I
watched it when like the first season
