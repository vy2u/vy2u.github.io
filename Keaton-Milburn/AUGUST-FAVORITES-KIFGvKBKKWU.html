say that in like all my videos just
because if I go like a week without
making a video it feels like it's been a
month and then when I make a video I
just feel so happy that I'm making a
video
no but I'm back and I'm doing a August
favorites for you guys and this is so
cute for me to be doing August favorites
because this would be this is the second
time on my channel I've ever done an
August favorites and so I'm really
really excited about it because I did a
July favorites when I started my channel
and I didn't do a July favorites last
month because I was so so busy so now I
am doing a August favorites and it's
just so cute because this is the second
August favorites on my channel and
there's gonna be so many more and yeah
I'm just super super excited for it so
with all that random crap being said
let's get into the favorites starting
off into the Beauty favorites also my
lining is really bad right now I'm sorry
I also know I'm in a different spot it's
because my lighting was so bad so I have
to sit right here by my window saw the
lighting what like looks better um
anyway let's just get into it
my first Beauty favorite of the month
would be why well my first Beauty
favorite is the naked skin Urban Decay
weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup so you guys know that I've always
used wool you might not know if you're
new to my channel hey if you guys don't
know I use the Mac I don't even know
what it's called I use the Mac
foundation for such a long time but it
was just so there was just too much of
an orange pigment in the Mac Foundation
and so instead of just like going to Mac
and getting another shade I decided to
try something that was a little less
expensive and then find a better shade
in it so I got this and I love this this
is probably one of the best foundation
so it's not a full coverage foundation
obviously it says weightless ultra
definition liquid makeup it's feels
light on my face it's I mean it says
liquid foundation like I mean like it
goes like my makeup forever Foundation
which is more full coverage like does
not spread as easily with it
I would need more of like a buffer brush
or a foundation brush to blend my Make
Up For Ever foundation in but with this
I can literally just use the Beauty
Blender and it blends so seamlessly and
so nice
definitely weightless I love this and
the color is so easy to match with my
skin like it oh my gosh it just matches
perfectly and yes I'm wearing it today
also have a spray can so like I look
kind of dark whatever but this is the
foundation I've been using and I am
obsessed with this like I will continue
to buy this the next thing that I picked
up is the Mario this Vettes you whatever
I don't know this is the Mario whatever
facial spray I saw this at Urban
Outfitters and I was like I think that
I've seen a beauty guru use this before
and let's try it so this is it doesn't
even look like I've used a lot in
literally looks full but that's just
because I only do a few light pumps on
my face but it's a facial spray with
aloe herbs and rosewater and so I do
this after I have either like washed all
my makeup off before I go to bed I'll
spray this on and it just feels so fresh
on my face I will admit sometimes it
feels like a little sticky but like when
it absorbed I guess into my skin it
feels a lot better and it just like
smooth is my face so I really like this
or I will use it before I put my makeup
on so normally I just do it when I have
nothing on my face not ever like when I
have full makeup on or anything like
that I just use this um after I take my
makeup off or before I put my makeup on
the next thing is the st. Ives blackhead
clearing green tea scrub and you guys
know I used the epic OTT st. Ives scrub
which is for like clear skin and stuff
like that I use that because it
exfoliates so good and so I bought this
that's why it's a little travel size I
bought it when I was traveling in
Vancouver and it works so good it's a
different kind of exfoliating than the
st. Ives it's not as harsh like I say I
don't it's like beads like you're like
legit like scrubbing your face off but
this one is not as harsh but it still
feels you know it still feels like this
same kind of like effect with this and
also smells like green tea and it's more
refreshing because it's
so I've been using this and it's almost
empty so I'm probably gonna have to get
this new one the next one is this
lipstick and I never know how to say it
so we're just gonna leave it right here
myrrh whatever is what I think it's
called and this is the MAC lipstick that
I have been wearing so much actually you
don't have it on right now as I say that
but this is the MAC lipstick that I've
been wearing so much and so many of you
guys have commented all my videos on all
my Instagram post you guys been tweeting
me like what is your lipstick this is it
I've comments in a few guys back I
always leave it underneath the videos it
was also in my last makeup tutorial so
I've been using this so much and I just
used this along with the spice lip liner
which is what I have on now and this is
just a super cute peak amplitude think
you guys can like see but it's literally
it has kind of a purpley undertone so
that's really pretty and I don't have a
lot of lipsticks like that which i think
is why I like it so much because it goes
good with my lip color next we're going
to move on to music so the first song
that I have literally been so obsessed
with is well actually okay there are
three songs there all three by drink
you guys have like all probably here
than before hotline bling literally
number one like jam right now I love
that song it's just I don't know I just
love it just the beat and every if
you've heard it you know number one song
right now second song also by Drake
would be back to back I love back to
back I also love charged up which to
both of those came out during the little
Meek Mill beef whatever if you don't
know it
research it not gonna explain the next
one is actually not a song it is an
artist and the artist is Alesia Cara's
the parrot EP came out and it's called
four pink walls and it's so good guys
like it is amazing her voice is probably
one of the most amazing things ever and
actually get to go see her at ACL so I'm
super super excited for that I still as
a music festival by the way if you guys
don't know but I'm super super excited
to go see her and I've been loving her
so much and since
EP came out which was like Friday I'm
just I've in love I'm really in love the
next one would be obviously everyone is
talking about it the weekends new album
it is amazing really really like his
music I like everything about it every
song comes out with but his album is so
so good there is not a single song on
his album that I don't like like I like
every single song it's amazing if you
haven't heard it go buy it and the next
one is Justin Bieber's what do you mean
it you guys haven't seen the music video
please just I'm honestly a nigga most
you know because it was so good and he
was just like making out with this girl
the whole time and I was just thinking
about like if I was that girl like oh my
god I can't oh my god
those are my music favorites now on to
some random ish favorites so let's talk
about jewelry because I don't have
clothing for this month I'll explain
that later let's talk about jewelry so
all three of these items are from a
Windsor store and they are not
sponsoring this video for me to say this
at all just by the way I wanted to put
these in here but this necklace would be
the first one so I was looking
everywhere for a long time or like the
like chain kind of necklaces like the
big necklaces that go with everything
these are so loud I was thinking for
them like everywhere and I really really
wanted to find them up and I couldn't
and then I found them on a Windsor store
and a lot of people say that they can
find this kind of stuff at forever 21
but to me the quality of these necklaces
compared to forever 21 if you guys don't
know forever 21
Jori breaks so much I don't know why
just their jewelry always breaks so this
like the quality of this necklace at my
armpit like no the quality of this
necklace is so good and it's just so
pretty so this one I was like that all
turquoise little thingies on it and I
paired it with this little bracelet so
you go with this here on your wrist like
down here but it's really really
Figg so what I like to do is like put it
up like halfway up my arm whoa
I put it up like halfway up my arm
because it like holds better and if it
just like keep signing around it just
like doesn't look cute and then it hangs
like this I don't know but I pair this
little bracelet with this necklace and
it's super adorable and then I also
really really like this one they're
almost the same thing but they're not
this one is just all chains so I really
like this I wore both of these ampersand
Instagram pictures with them so if you
want to see how I like style them then
you can go check out my Instagram right
there next favorite is my camera so you
guys know for a long time I've logged
with my GoPro and I love to my GoPro
just cuz it's easy it's small it was
portable and I did not want to go buy a
new camera at the time so when I was in
the Dominican if you guys watch my
videos my Dominican vlogs my GoPro got
stolen so I bought this camera on my own
with my own money and I love it it's
beautiful and it works so well it is the
canon g7x and it has a little flip up
screen on it and i'll turn it on so you
