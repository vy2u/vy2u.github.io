to be my back-to-school try on haul so I
know this video is taking a while to
film and upload for you guys but that is
because I've been so so busy back at
school with recruitment everything being
in a store you know that kind of stuff
I'm really excited to be filming this
video for you guys and I want you guys
to please keep in mind that I am a
sophomore in college so although some of
these items might not fit you guys dress
code most of them will not fit your
dress code keep that in mind that this
is my personal back-to-school shopping
and I hope it's helpful for you guys
hope you guys get some style inspiration
it's also just really fun to go shopping
in general I honestly use back-to-school
shopping as an excuse to buy like
literally whatever I want
so yeah let's just get into it so the
first items I'm going to be showing you
are from Lulu so you guys know this is
not even a haul if I don't have Lulu's
and I absolutely love Lee Lewis
so I'm so excited to be paired with them
on this video so thank you Lewis for
sending me all these awesome items so
the first item I want to show you guys
is this off the shoulder top so this is
just like a green off the shoulder top
it reminds me of a cactus um they have
the matching pants with this on the side
but I just really really love this I
think tube tops especially because I
live in Arizona it's literally been 1/10
like all week for wearing tube tops and
stuff to class is like honestly normal
because it's so hot and I don't want to
wear t-shirts because I sweat so I
thought this was so cute paired with
like denim anything like that
speaking of denim I got this skirt from
Lulu so this is just a denim jean skirt
and I honestly think this is probably
the most perfect jean skirt if you guys
watched my other haul I got this in
white from Lula's and I absolutely love
it I feel like a gem skirt it's such a
staple and it's really really trendy
right now I feel like what I'm going
back to school shopping I want very very
basic items that I can re wear
throughout the year because if you get
patterned items when you go
back-to-school shopping you wear like a
patterned top to school once and then
everyone knows you already wore it so
getting sample items like jeans skirts
and I'll show you the other items but
getting basic staple items for
back-to-school I think is awesome so I
love this skirt next up I got this dress
so this is just a white like body con
thing dress it is just the most simple
dress ever but I'm really excited
to style it and a bunch of different
ways because you could definitely dress
this up with like heels or something but
you could also wear like vans like my
platform bands I'll show you guys but
you could wear vans or like anything
like that with a dress and like make it
super casual or you could dress it up I
also have this in black boom Lulu's and
I just really like the fit of this I am
so sorry that I sound like I'm actually
dying right now like my voice is so
weird it's because I have a cold and I'm
trying to like push through because I'm
in college and I'm and I'm gonna dull
and I like can't be sick if the next
item is this white lace dress it has
black in the front and I have been
eyeing this on luscom for so long I
absolutely love the way that high neck
tops or dresses or anything like that
fit on me and I just think high neck is
really really flattering it makes me
look like slimmer so we like that this
is high neck and they also have this
dress in black which i think is really
pretty as well next up from Lulu's I got
this white oversized t-shirts you guys
might be thinking like that is so huge
which like it is so huge and this is a
size small so it's supposed to be
oversized it also has a slit down the
side which i think is cute so there's a
lot of different ways you can style this
you can tie the front and like make it
kind of like casual or you can like
really dress this up you could wear so
much jewelry with this and can we wear
all gold necklaces and hoops and things
like that and we're like little heels or
you could wear this with like denim and
then really converse something like that
so the last thing that I got from Lulu's
are these socks
so there are fishnet socks at the top of
them have like these three stripes and I
thought these would be so cute under
like vans or like the checkered vans or
any like conferences and like that
I just thought these were a little bit
different and I'm really excited to
style them so that is everything from
Lulu's I absolutely love Lulu's you guys
know this I will link all the products
down below don't forget to go follow
them on Instagram and go check out their
whole website they have so many new
clothes and they always are like posting
new things that I'm just like I need to
shop there every single day so if you
guys want to go check out Lulu's and
yeah move on to the next one so now
because I absolutely live for Urban
Outfitters I ordered some things from
Urban Outfitters which this is literally
my excuse to go back-to-school shopping
is because I want to order things from
Urban Outfitters
now but I got two pair of shoes so the
first pair of shoes that I got are these
advanced and these are so cute they're
platform I've already worn both of these
shoes like repeatedly ever every day
since I bought them but they're just the
simple black platform advanced I feel
like they're really really cute jeans
are like a denim skirt I don't know I
just feel like these are so cute and I
can wear them like every day I also want
to pair them with the fishnet socks from
Lulu's I think that would be adorable
like hi I just think it'd be so cute so
I got the next up I got these vans they
are obviously very like worn in already
because I literally just bought them and
I've worn them like every single day but
I feel like these are really trendy
right now like everyone's wearing these
again they used to be so popular but now
they're like back in style and I'm
really about it I just think they look
sporty and cute and I feel like I'm a
skateboarder and I'm not really a
skateboarder but it works it's fine I'm
fine next thing I got from urban was
this button up and not gonna lie I only
bought it because it was yellow and I
was just like I really like yellow and I
think it'd be cute for I don't know it's
not like I don't know why I bought this
um but it's just a really cute button up
and it has like little stripes down
that's blue and I feel like you can
either like tie it up or you can wear it
oversized I've got it in a medium in
case I wanted to wear it oversized but I
just thought it was really cute and
simple next up is this striped top from
urban this is just black and white
strips it's also a like tie top so I
actually wore this to the Bryson tiller
concert with like a little like lace bra
underneath it and it was really really
cute so I feel like this will look
really good just for like dinners like
nice little dinners if I go out anywhere
not that I really ever go out but like
if I ever do I can wear this stuff next
up is this crop top so this looks
literally so tiny it's the cutest most
comfortable crop top I have it in light
blue and I posted a few in Sierra's in
the light blue one but after I bought
the light blue and I was like I feel
like I need this in every color so I got
it in black because I wear black often
and because normally when I'm wearing
this top because it's so tight and it
fits really well I don't wear a bra with
it
so I didn't get the white one because I
was like I don't want to be like nipping
out here but I think the black ones
really really cute I bought this top it
just says special lady on that house of
rose and I bought this from Irving as
well I really wanted to just like style
differently I feel like this would be
really cute tucked into like the jeans
skirt from Lulu's or just like paired
with like jeans tied up I don't know I
feel like graphic tees are really really
easy to style and you can wear a bunch
of different ways so I got this and I
want a pair with like hoops and jewelry
and things like that so I think it's
really cute this is my favorite item
from urban like out of everything so
this is the Nike it's a cropped Nike
jacket I honestly I don't know what
material describe this I was gonna say
dry fit but like it's not dry fit like
it feels like I don't know how to
describe it but it's really cute it has
this huge check on the back and it's one
of those things where it's like a sporty
brand and it's a sporty jacket but like
you can wear it out not like you're
working out I could wear this with like
a tube top underneath it and like jean
skirt the one from Lulu's and then like
my checkered pants or something and it
would be like such a look but it's still
like and thank you think so label looks
like I'm like spit also like I said
absolutely love high neck and I like
that the collar looks up I kind of feel
like I'm Michael Jackson in this but
okay so the next few items are from a
store called V Dumoulin I will link them
down below I mentioned them in a hall
like a while back and you guys actually
really really loved them you guys like
what on their site about everything so
this is actually a store that's in
Arizona but they have an online website
so you guys can like go buy the stuff
online it's really cute so the first
half is this off the shoulder top I say
off the shoulder but it's literally a
tube top but I think it's really really
cute so I got this so the next thing is
this bodysuit so in my last haul I
actually had a white bodysuit from them
and you guys loved it you guys went and
like sold it out on the side so now I
got this black one and it hasn't lace in
the front I feel like this would be so
cute tucked into like jeans with like a
cute little belt and like booties or
something I feel like this body seats
are just perfect for like going to a
cute dinner like going out somewhere and
I think this one is so pretty on so
that's next top I actually just really
loved the color of it so the sleeves are
kind of like loose on the end and it's
one of those I want to say like the
peplum kind of tops but it's not really
it ties in the front I just think it's
so cute I think but when you have a tan
with colors like this it really makes
your skin pop so I got this and I think
I want to pair it with like
like gold necklaces down the middle I
think that would be so cute so I got
this and I just feel like it looks so
pretty and I feel like this will be
perfect for fall coming up nothing about
from being a villain is a bathing suit
so they actually sell so many keeping
suits like I go on their Instagram and
I'm always like wait why are their
bathing suits so cute so this one is a
little bit different it's so out of my
comfort zone but it is like this red
floral e pattern and then it has cheetah
on like the tide so I feel like it's
such a unique bathing suit like I don't
feel like anyone would ever really like
buy this and be like oh my god yeah
cheetah and floral they go together
great but when I saw it I was just like
the colors are so pretty so I'm excited
to wear this is just like pool parties
and like tanning and things like that I
just feel like the colors are so it's
such a different bathing suit that like
when I saw it I was like wait I kind of
need this
so I actually love this and the brand is
actually beach right but they sell so
many beach right bathing suits on vida
Mullen I want to say feel like I'm on my
deathbed like I feel like I'm dying
except is this shirt this shirt is from
Ali and aol.com
and this it's like a remake of the Gucci
shirt like you know the one that
everyone's buying but it actually says
alpha P if you guys didn't know that's
the story I'm in like hints like my
little sign over there who says alpha
feet um but I actually love this I think
it's so cute and honestly I literally
went in the Gucci store and was like
debating on buying the actual could you
sure but like I just didn't want to
spend $420 on a t-shirt like come on
people so of course I want an a-line
Arial and I got this one and if any of
you guys are in a sorority I think it's
really really cute they have a bunch of
different like organizations that you
can put like they have a bunch of
different stories you can put it's not
just alphas fee I'm just I'll link Ali
and Ericom if you guys go on their
Instagram go follow them right now go
tell them that I sent you because I
actually love them and I feel like if
you guys are in a sorority you guys are
looking for a cute apparel they haven't
it's really cute so so this next top I
bought out of like pure excitement like
I bought it out of like pure shock um
this is another high neck crop top so
this is actually from Free People and I
walked in three people and I saw it and
I was like oh that's cute but every time
I walk in three people I feel like like
a shoelace it's like $500 so I was like
I
ever buy anything and free people I'm
just going free people to browse and
then I leave but I looked at this and it
was $30 and I was like white this is $30
and they also have it in white which I
feel like I also need the white one but
I bought this and it's so so cute it's
also really really tight fitting it's
kind of like how the urban crop top does
I think this is so cute especially of
too high neck because that means it's
not just a crop top you can like dress
it up with like nice jeans and things
like that so I thought this was really
cute and then the last item I bought
this because yeah I like high tech
things so this is like more of like a
muscle two key but it also goes higher
up on me it has little like frills on
the sleeves and on the bottom and it's
just a white basic tee again a lot of
these things are super like just solid
pieces because when I always go back to
school shopping I try not to buy pattern
things because I wear them one time and
then everyone knows I've worn that has
everything for my back to school haul I
hope you guys liked this video give it a
