different today I'm standing while I
talk to you guys just because I didn't
really like the look of me when I was
sitting so also I dyed my hair I don't
know if you guys like it
I like it a lot I like being blonde
again so I'm taking it anyway today's
video is going to be a try on haul
because I know you guys love these and
this is also a back to school haul
because all of these things I have been
saving Ike bought since the beginning of
school and then I just kind of got like
a good-enough collection to show you
guys I know it's kind of like the middle
of school like you guys are already in
school right now but I hope these give
you some ideas of what else you can wear
in the fall or just like to school and I
am a college so if these things don't
work with your dress code you can always
put a jacket or something over them um
so let's gonna do it the first things
that I'm going to show you guys are from
Urban Outfitters because I literally
don't shop at Urban Outfitters basically
serve my life but the first thing is
this Tommy Hilfiger shirt so I love this
I love that it's like partially cropped
it's not too cropped you can wear with
high-waisted jeans and it doesn't show
your stomach I think it's so cute tucked
in with like either sneakers or you
could dress it up and wear like a jean
jacket over it
I don't know I just really love the look
of this whole shirt I love Tommy
Hilfiger right now they get so cute
next is this dress kind of thing so this
isn't actually a dress it's from the out
from under line from Urban Outfitters
and it is a slip like you can wear it
under other things but I wore it just by
itself and I thought it was really cute
it's super comfy and I just really love
dresses like this that are like a super
comfy material and really simple because
you can dress them up or make them like
super casual with again a jean jacket or
some sneakers and stuff like that I
think that's really really cute next one
Urban is this tube top it looks super
tiny right here but I also have this in
lavender and so when I saw they had in
black I was like I really need black so
I bought this I wear to the Drake
concert I just think it's super cute and
it's actually really really fitting so
like you don't have to wear a bra that
it's just super comfortable and
I love with tube tops I think I need to
buy this in white as well because I
always want to wear these I just love
them with like high-waisted jeans and
stuff like that so very cute as you guys
know my favorite color is yellow so I
bought this sweatshirt
it says Urban Outfitters on it it is
like their bdg line so it's just a
sweatshirt I thought it was really comfy
and I don't know I just really like
yellow and I was like I could wear that
with anything and like feel so happy so
I bought that and then to go with my
yellow okay obviously I won't wear these
together but I bought some yellow jeans
and these are like girlfriend jeans so
they're not fitting on the end
they're like loose you can wear like
sneakers I don't know I just like the
way that they look and I thought yellow
was really really good for like a spring
or something I know we're getting into
fall but I just think yellow is really
pretty all the time so that's my pants
next we're going to move on to Lulu's I
know you guys know I love Lulu I think
that their website is amazing they have
super affordable clothes and there's
something really really cute I don't
know everything about Lulu's is adorable
so I'm going to show you a few things
that go from there this is just a blue
like throw on kind of shift dress but I
like that it's lace on the side I don't
know I think it adds something to it and
I just thought the color was so pretty
and I'm not even just saying this but if
you're blonde I think this color blue
looks amazing on Blondes I don't know
why but I really love this so yeah
I'm also obsessed with like silk dresses
I don't know why but like they're just a
thing right now so I have this one I
don't know what kind of color I would
say this is like taupe or like mauve
kind of color but it's really simple it
laces up in the back and I just think
it's perfect with accessories you can
like dress this up or again make it
really casual that's like my favorite
items to buy it's just like things that
you can either dress
really really nicely or just like throw
a jacket and some like shoes on with it
and make it really simple so I love this
next I have this top which i think is so
cute so it has a deep v in the front and
it's cropped and then I love the sleeves
I love that they're big and I think this
would be perfect with either a high
waisted like pencil skirt or
high-waisted jeans and like heels I
think this would be so cute and like a
choker I just like love the way this
looks I could style this in so many ways
so you probably will be seeing this on
my Instagram because I absolutely love
it I think it's so cute
so speaking of chokers this is one that
is just white and it has like little
studs all around it I have so many
chokers but I didn't have a white one
that was just like really simple so when
I saw this it's like this is so cute
so I think this would look really really
good paired with like other necklaces
layered this is like my favorite thing
in the whole world so this is a black
like fishnet lookin choker but it has
three layered necklaces with it and I
think that's so cute that's such a good
idea to like add them all in one so I
showed you guys in the nude once a while
back but these blue Steve Madden suede
heels these are the ones I originally
wanted and I think Hallie has them and
sure when I was like they're just so
cute I have to have them so I just love
that they're suede and I love the color
blue I love that it's not like too
bright it's perfect just to like pair
with a really simple outfit so I love
these and I just love seeing Madden and
the fact that they sell them at Lulu's
makes it so much better so everything
that I bought from Lulu's is going to be
linked down below don't forget to go
click it check out their website they're
awesome and amazing and absolutely love
them but everything is going to be
linked in the description bar okay so
the next item is really really random
and some of you guys might not care
about this oh I thought nothing was open
some of you guys might not care about
this but if any of you guys are looking
for I saw some girls on Instagram
wearing them and I was like that would
be such a cute idea for a football game
so if you guys are like in college like
me and are looking for little
cheerleading skirts so I bought this and
it's yellow because I go to ASU and we
are yellow and maroon so I figured this
would be so cute if I paired it with
just like I'm originally crop top and
like I don't know I think it would be
cute for like a game or two so I bought
this and I think it's from cheerleading
comm honestly I will link it down below
but I figured I would just show you guys
because a lot of people were asking me
like where like what I wear on game days
I'm like that kind of thing and so I
just bought this and I figured I would
show you guys yeah I think it's yeah
cheerleading comm so that is it for my
back to school try on haul I hope you
guys liked it I wasn't too many clothes
just because um I really don't dress up
that often for school I really wear like
a t-shirt and shorts every single day
but I did get some of these items and I
want to show you guys then because a lot
of them I think you could wear for fall
and just like really fun things like
that so I hope you guys like this video

Twitter and I will go follow you guys
