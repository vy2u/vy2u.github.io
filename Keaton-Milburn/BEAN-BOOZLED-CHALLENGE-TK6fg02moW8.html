basically Jelly Belly made these beans
and the one it's like a really good
flavor like one is tutti frutti and one
is stinky socks one is rotten egg and
buttered popcorn so you have good
flavors and you have bad flavors and one
of you gets them because they look like

coke right here and we have our cups in
case it's literally so disgusting and we
throw up um this one is rotten egg or
