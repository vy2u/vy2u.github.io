going to be a Black Friday haul and I
actually just went Black Friday shopping
yesterday and it's Saturday so I bought
a lot of things actually I didn't expect
to I've never actually been Black Friday
shopping so this is my first year going
I was at a big mall I went to the
Galleria in Houston and it was not bad
at all I mean basically the lines were
like and but other than that it was
pretty good and I got some pretty good
deals so I'm just gonna be showing you
guys what I got so I went to Urban
Outfitters and Urban Outfitters by far
like made my day they literally hooked
me up so much I went in Urban Outfitters
didn't even look anywhere else I went
straight to the sale sign she cuz I was
like oh let's go see what's on sale it
was 50% off the sale item so everything
on sale was also an additional 50% off
it was insane and it was so amazing and
so I bought the first thing I bought was
this it's kind of tinted grey I don't
know if you can tell it I mean tinted
green I don't know if you can tell cuz
it looks really grey but I don't know
it's just like really comfy this is in
the men's section and I got a large and
I'm obsessed with it I already slept in
it and I wore it the day I got it so
okay it's gonna be really hard to show
you guys on camera but this is a sweater
this was like $40 and I got it for 15
and it's a long like extremely long
cardigan it goes to my ankles I believe
and it is not just a great cardigan it
has a slit in the side like that and
then it has little pockets and it has a
really big hood it's just really cute I
don't know I already wore it also I wore
it with that shirt the last thing in
Urban Outfitters that I got was this
shirt and it's you can't even tell that
it actually has a picture on it really
but it says it says no stains without
sinners and then it has a little skull I
don't know I didn't really buy it for
the same but I bought it because it's
really cute and of course Urban
Outfitters clothes are like really soft
and it just kind of looks to stress
on the shoulder and stuff and this was
20 bucks and I got it for 10 so I bought
two more things that Urban Outfitters
but I bought them for my boyfriend for
Christmas and if he's watching this
video I'm not showing you and you're
giving them on Christmas next I went to
H&amp;amp;M I've been in H&amp;amp;M before when I go to
New York and stuff but when I went there
I bought this shirt
it just says NYC on it and it's gray and
black kind of looking it's so soft this
was also in the men's section because
basically I am men and that's where I
shop okay the next thing is also really
long and it's also on a hanger right now
but I got it also at H&amp;amp;M and it was the
20 bucks and it's so cute guys it's this
long okay okay here's the top of it it's
just like looks like a tank but it's a
long jumper so it's like these long pant
legs and then I sounds so stuffy oh my
gosh and then it has this little tie
around the waist I don't know it's just
a big jumper and it's so cute guys I'm
obsessed with it I need it in my life
and then I went to Zara and I got this
shirt which was 30% off I don't know how
to do math so I can't really tell you
the price I got this shirt it's just
white and has like little buildings on
it London and like I just talked about
how I want to go to London what a little
cute segue to tell you guys to go click
on my last YouTube video where I answer
you guys questions and then I got this
one I think this one's really cute it's
just a black like what is this material
called I don't know some sheer stuff
it's a black sheer top but I don't know
if you can tell this is lace right here
so it's a v-neck but it's like lacy and
it looks like you're wearing a little
tank top under it but you're not and
it's this next item I am obsessed with I
also already wore them yesterday so cute
I got them from j.crew and
they're actually rain boots but they're
so stylish guys look at these rain boots
they're just like army green ray boots
and they had them in navy and black and
it was so difficult for me to try to
decide what color I wanted but I just
feel like I don't know like why is it
black that's so I don't know like
everyone has black boots but like green
rain boots so cute I love these the last
two items I got were at Mac obviously I
am obsessed with lipstick and I cannot
get enough of it from that I have the
shade I'm wearing right now which is
what is it called its called kinda sexy
and then I'm wearing the lip liner spice
and then I have my pink plaid one I'm
either writing really pink lipstick or a
really dark lipstick and I don't have it
in between one I just don't and so now I
do I went and I bought this one it is
the color captive and this is the
lipstick the lipstick it's actually kind
of darker but this'll apply there a guy
so slip liner is the most beautiful
color it's called in anticipation and
it's basically the prettiest thing ever
so this is a lot lighter and it's a lot
more pink and this is a lot more dark so
when you put the pink lip liner on and
the you says darker lipstick on it just
like makes them into a beautiful I don't
even know it just looks like Valentine's
Day blew up on my lips and it's just so
cute and I'm excited to wear these two
together the last item was sent to me
from Joab Brown I am obsessed with it
guys I'm obsessed with Joe Brown right
now I think that's probably gonna be a
little November favorite but um oh my
god I'm literally so stupid I got this
it's also another long cardigan and it's
like so long and it's honestly the
softest thing I've ever felt in my life
it's like it's like softer than Brandis
shirts like if that's telling you
anything like that is how soft this is
and it just has like little pockets and
it's a light pink and I can wear it with
so much stuff I'm so excited so Joe
Brown is actually an
online store and I found them through
Instagram and I absolutely love their
stuff they have tank tops they have
sweaters they have everything so I'm
