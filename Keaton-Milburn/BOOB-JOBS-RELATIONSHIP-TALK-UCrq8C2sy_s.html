to be answering a bunch of very
uncomfortable questions that you guys
have asked me on my tumblr if you guys
didn't see that I'm doing this video
guys follow me on Instagram or Twitter I
posted on my Instagram and I was like
here is the link to ask me uncomfortable
questions anonymously so I love how you
guys do this I love answering questions
that make me feel weird also my phone
case is from well our cases guys go
check out their website they stick in
this case and I love it it's so cute
first question what does the M on your
necklace stand for everyone has asked me
that since I bought it I posted on my
Instagram if it stands for Melbourne my
last name is Melbourne everyone was
telling me it stands for miles how you
gonna tell me what my necklace stands
for definitely stands for Melbourne but
good try you guys are always asking me
if I'm still a virgin yes I am I told
you guys this and multiple videos
because I told you guys that I waited
till marriage but what you guys are
asking me questions about like how do
you go about telling guys that you're
writing for marriage and all this kind
of stuff or like how does it like affect
your school life especially because all
my friends I mean I go to ASU so it's
like all my friends have sex and drink
and do all this stuff but like how do I
was seen from doing all that number one
I normally don't like meet someone and
I'm like hey I'm kidding I'm a virgin
like that's not a talking point of mine
I normally don't tell people if I'm like
talking to someone for a while I'm
talking to a guy we're like cooler and
ever if it gets to the point where I see
us like actually dating and I like
actually want to be with them like
seriously then I'll let them know like
hey like just so you know like when
we're dating like I'm not like I will
not be acting sexy like just want you to
know that and if they're like oh my god
okay like what the heck gotta go I'll be
like normally every guy I've probably
told which I haven't like told a lot
guys and I'm talking to you I'm not like
that's not the first thing that pops up
into my head one they probably already
know because it's like people talk and
they just know if they're gonna talk to
me then they just know that and to it's
just like not something that they would
ask me but normally they just like don't
really care like they understand it they
respect it normally guys are just like
okay like I get
like it's fine whatever and like they
don't say anything about it and normally
I don't end up talking to them or a
really long time so it doesn't really
matter either way when I get into a
relationship where I'm with someone for
like years and years and years then I'll
let you guys know how we deal with it
but I'm not at that point so one thing I
do want to say though it's like if a guy
is like oh yeah I totally understand
like I get it like you don't have sex
ball the law but then like when you're
hanging out with them they still you
still feel like they're kind of
pressuring it onto you or they're like
trying to make you like change your mind
that's like not someone you want to be
with that all like the person you're
supposed to be with should not be doing
that they should not be like yeah I can
handle you don't have sex but like maybe
like later down the line like no like no
means now what if you say no six months
into the relationship and you say no six
months before you guys even start dating
it shouldn't matter when you say no you
don't have sex and you don't have to
have sex with them like it doesn't
matter a lot of the questions are about
like how do you go about not drinking or
like not doing drugs when you're out
with all your friends that do do those
things honestly it's been such a part of
my like lifestyle but it doesn't even
like faze me anymore and a lot of people
were like oh my gosh you say you know
drinking you say you don't like do drugs
but I see you at parties and I see you
going out and it's like do you want me
to like stay in my room and like soak
while all my friends are out like no
it's like I personally choose not to
drink and not to do drugs because I
don't want to do that like that is not
fun to me and I don't want to do that
like I see all my friends getting drunk
and I'm like cool like y'all have a good
time but like I don't want to do it so
it's like I'm still gonna go out I go to
frat parties you see me out of frat
party I've met so many subscribers and
frat parties and I'm like I'm sure they
think I'm like drunk right now because
I'm at a party but like not everyone you
meet at the party is chunk like I
promise there's a lot more people at
parties and you think that like aren't
low-key drinking so it's not weird to me
like I don't get annoyed easily by like
drunk people I don't get annoyed by
people being loud or like singing songs
like I'm a very like easygoing person if
I'm out with all my friends and they
won't like
dance on the dance floor and like get
wild like okay like let's go then like
let's have fun I mean I'm not gonna like
active pool and like puke everywhere but
like I'm still gonna have fun so a lot
of people were just like how do you go
about doing that and it's like have the
same exact amount of fun that you would
normally have you just don't have
alcohol I've just really learned to like
let loose just like let it go
like who cares like honestly it really
doesn't matter I probably never see
these people again and like I'm having
fun then I just don't care what anyone
else is doing I might look stupid
dancing because I'm like so burly trying
to dance but like what is your workout
routine I've been wanting to film
workout team cuz a lot of you guys
watched my blog miss and I showed you
guys like my trainer and some of the
workouts we did which if you guys aren't
watching blog miss then you guys are
probably like oh my god keaton said she
has a post on her main channel it's so
long which is true like i have a post on
this channel and so on I've been so
consumed with like doing vlogmas and
focusing on a lot of other stuff so if
you guys want to see what I'm doing
every single day this month because you
guys aren't seeing me enough on my main
channel go to my vlog channel I posted
my workout I don't know what today it
was but I really wanted to work out a
team with my trainer because he's
awesome and like he does so many cool
workout so I might be filming that when
I go back to Arizona do you find Big
Sean more attractive with scrub or
without definitely with I mean I find
him attractive on every single level
like it doesn't really matter what he's
wearing oh my god not anyone tell me my
necklace was twisted this whole time
come on you know yeah definitely with
scruff when is too soon to say the l
word in a relationship and then in
quotations they put love not lesbian why
don't you I don't think it's too soon to
say it actually okay I take that back
because sometimes people come over me
like really really soon like a month
into a ship and I'm like no it does
freak the other person out if you say it
too early you really just need to know
how y'all are both feeling like you have
to make sure you guys are on the same
page I've never said first I've always
been too nervous um just because I'm
like that
ya know I have too much excited to ever
say that
but like you should definitely make sure
the person is on the same page as you
because how awkward would it be if you
were like I love you and they were like
yeah BAM this is a good question have
you ever been jealous of your ex after
you guys broke up if so what are some
funny stories that you did to show you
were jealous also how did you stop
thinking about negs I mean I feel like
everyone has like jealousy issues when
they leave someone they're just like oh
my god I doesn't even matter what your
ex is doing like they could be like
going to the Mon you could be like like
you just get like jealous and annoyed
which like I feel like every girl has
that it's just like whatever you can't
help it your girl guys do this too like
don't think that guys don't do this
because trust me me being friends with
miles and Barack and Josh and all them
like they tell me like oh my god I hate
when this girl does this I hate when
this girl does this like I know so I
know guys could kill this Jew they just
don't show what that girl's do girls are
crazy but like yeah the second I have a
thought in my head that's like oh my god
like one day I was like I will
automatically change the subject the
easiest easiest way for me to like stop
thinking about somebody you should talk
to or like stop thinking about an ex is
to just focus on every other thing well
it's like the second I start to think
about them I'm like no okay anyway so
the other day I was like I literally
changed my thought process and I go and
do stuff like all day like it doesn't
even matter if I'm like going out with
my friend so you don't have to do that
you can just like go drive in your car
and like listen to happy music or like
go grocery shopping go to the mall like
go do your makeup like I oh my gosh
that's like my favorite thing to do when
my mind is like racing if I'm thinking
about something like a long time miler
just sit down I'll take like two hours
to do my makeup I'll do like a full beat
while I'm watching Netflix like that is
the easiest way I get like an X or
someone that's bothering me off my mind
I just like occupy my time and I just
get over them this one is already
nipples beers everyone asked me that no
another question I keep getting on here
is did I get a boob job no I did not get
a boob job letting my manager asked me
now the other day I was like no everyone
thinks that I've gotten a boob job I
don't know what it is maybe they grow
maybe they're a different size no boob
jobs for me kids
I have nice
lene boobies do you think kylie is
pregnant
this is the real tea y'all I don't think
she's pregnant I really I truly don't
think she's pregnant one because I
watched life of Kylie and she was
talking about how like oh my gosh I need
to happen to be like a teenager and like
I couldn't be with Taemin because of
this so I'm like she couldn't be with
Tyga cuz she like didn't want to be a
mom and she want to live her life than
like why would she just go date someone
else and then get pregnant I also just
don't think that the Kardashians and
Jenner's are like that stupid like I
just don't think that she would be that
irresponsible but then again like you
never know you I feel like she's not the
type of person it's like have an
abortion so if she did accidentally get
pregnant she would first share half the
baby so it's like 50/50 but I I really
don't think she's pregnant I think this
is just a publicity set so that will
watch more cannot you come watch me
other way but I don't think she's
pregnant do you shave or wax your under
area shave I've never backs I'm too
scared I feel like I would die I've
asked so many people that hurts and they
all say yes that is the most people
thing ever I could not do it if you guys
do it let me know your experience down
below because I couldn't like I think
that would be awesome because it's like
you don't have to have like hair for
like the longest time ever but at the
same time I don't have a very high pain
tolerance so I really don't think I can
do it I could barely get my eyebrows
waxed and like my lip wax without like
crying so I just I couldn't do it this
question is who's your favorite
quarterback
I love dak Prescott from the cowboy is
I'm a huge Cowboys fan to hear Cowboys
fan can this video thumbs up because we
need to stick together in this desperate
time of hurt please like this video
because I'm in a lot of pain because
apples right now oh this is a good one
it says how do you get away with not
drinking in a college scene but people
offering you drinks normally like the
best way I go bottom someone's like hey
you want to drink or like oh wait take
this shot I'm like all I'm good I'm
driving tonight thank you though like
I'm driving them home in Norman with my
friends and like that's not a lie I am
driving my friends whole like every
single time I go hard I Drive them home
so it's not a lie someone offers you a
drink and you say oh I'm driving them
home I'm driving my friend's house and
they're like oh you suck then like eel
okay no like you obviously don't care
about people drunk Driving's I'm looks
like a take a drink I'm like oh I'm not
drinking tonight I have a test in the
morning or like oh I'm not drinking and
I'm driving someone home or I normally
don't say oh I'm not drinking I've
actually never drank at all I've never
had a sip of alcohol I've never taken a
shot of my life and I'm 20 years old
that is not something I tell someone
someone asked me for a new skincare
routine and I wish I could give you guys
one but my skincare routine is so like
messed up right now I don't know what it
is I think it's just because I've been
flying so much but I've been getting so
many random breakouts like I know you
guys are gonna be like oh my god you
have nothing I new skin but like when I
take my makeup off I normally like don't
have that many pimples and recently I've
been getting tons of pimples like right
Kunj on my forehead and I got the most
pimples when I was flying like four
times a week like two weeks ago when I
was flying back and forth that was when
I got a lot of breakouts oh I'm honestly
waiting till my skin clears out but I
look to another like skincare routine I
get a lot of questions about my sorority
and if I've genuinely chose my sorority
because I wanted to choose it absolutely
100% I was actually really really torn
before I joined alpha feet the other
sorority that I was like obsessed with
and I thought they were like so cute and
so nice I realized that like they were
not the fit for me and I really only had
one genuine connection with one girl in
there and she was the only girl that I
liked and I was like I have like ten
genuine connections in alpha P and this
other one I have like one girl like I
don't want to join a sorority because of
one single parts and like I want to join
this already because of the whole
hundred percent I know without a doubt
like that is the sorority I'm supposed
to be in if I was in the sorority
my life would be completely different I
wouldn't have met the people I needed to
meet in my life like I wouldn't have
now I wouldn't have Kelsey like it's
just like there are so many people in my
life I wouldn't have and I know 100% I
made the right decision by choosing that
sorority a lot of you guys are thinking
about sororities right now because it's
getting like this school year and you
guys are looking at colleges and stuff I
made an entire sorority recruitment
video I get so many questions all the
time about my sorority if you guys want
to go watch that up should put like the
little bar right here you guys can go
watch it it's very informative if I do
say so myself a lot of you guys were
saying it helped you guys with your
sorority recruitment process so if you
guys want to watch that I'll link that
below a lot of my questions are like
what happened with you and your last ex
and I think a lot of you guys think that
my last ex was Landon who is in my
boyfriend tag like how many or three
years ago I think a lot of you guys
think that that was my last ex boyfriend
oh it was it always asked me like oh are
you and your ex like why don't you ever
talk about having them like I don't know
what ex are talking about because I've
had multiple exes in between land and
like I put him on social media but he's
not my only ex so sometimes when I'm
tweeting you guys you're like oh my gosh
like T oh my god I'm like that was like
four years ago I'm definitely not
talking about him anymore
I'm definitely talking about someone
else you guys just like don't know just
because I'm like I'm not gonna put every
single person I talked to on social
media because then it's like you guys
would be so confused all the time
learned after I put like me and him on
social media everywhere that like I
don't want me and who I've run with to
be on social media everywhere like it
just makes me so uncomfortable that's
all the questions I'm gonna be answering
for you guys today I have so many
questions so if you guys want to ask me
any more that you guys think I didn't
answer well enough ask me down below and
