but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be a summer try on haul thank you so
much to boohoo for sponsoring this video
I have so many clothes I'm so excited to
show you guys I love summer I love
summer clothing and I feel like this was
a really good time to just like explore
with my clothing all of these pieces are
so cute and so beautiful I love the
colors about them and I rarely rarely
wear colors but I feel like the summer
time is the perfect time to wear coats
because it means you look tan and stuff
so I'm super excited to show you guys
all the clothes if you guys want I have
a 10% discount code for you guys it's
Keaton ten I will also link it down
below you guys can go look at all these
items that I'm showing you from poo I
know you guys will love them and there's
so many more on the site so I know you
guys will be like in love with it for
the first I am I'm just gonna start with
what I'm wearing because this is like
one of my favorites and I just feel like
it makes it look really tan so it's just
this lavender off the shoulder top you
guys can see it better in the Tryon but
I absolutely love it I love playing v
and I really like the ruffles I feel
like those are really summery I love
that they're on the neckline and they're
also on the sleeve I really really love
the color lavender obviously I've been
here lavender for a reason but I really
really love this top and if it's super
comfortable most of these items are
tight ops so they look a lot better in
the child than they do me holding it up
but I love this color pink it's like a
pastel pink color it also makes you look
really tan for summer and I feel like it
would be really pretty with different
color bra legs underneath it just to
like show different ways to wear it I
really think this is so cute and because
I like just solid color tops like this
because you can sell them different ways
I can wear this jeans one night and
dress it up or I could just wear it
ressure the ANBU has so many affordable
clothes like this is just such good
quality and so pretty odd I feel like
they sell a set a bunch of other stores
overpriced but boo boo has such
affordable prices
this next hub is my favorite from all of
the clothes that I got and I feel like
this would be so pretty at summer
tropical if any of you guys are
traveling somewhere like the tropical
plants going to Y or anywhere with our
Beach honestly these clothing items
their summer collection elgu is so nice
for that so this top is really pretty
it's a peach color I think at all
I'm gonna camera but it's like peach and
has all these leaves on its super
tropical most of the stuff I have on
here has bleep so imma just because
that's what I like
it's off-the-shoulder most of these tops
are off-the-shoulder because I just
think off the solar tops are more
flattering on me for some reason I don't
know like higher neckline stuff looks
kind of weird on you so I love the
off-the-shoulder look especially for the
summer it's hot and loved in its crops
and I also really love that the sleeves
at the end are like tight so it's not
just like a loose off the shoulder top
it's had something different on it and I
like that they added like the tightness
at the end with the buttons this top you
Lurie can't tell what it looks like
unless you look at the dryer at all but
it's so so cute on I love the idea of
having two ties so the first tie at the
top obviously goes around like your
boobs area then the second one tighter I
tied that one tighter said it like
cinches at my waist more and it makes me
like summer but I love that this has two
x on it it's about the shoulder again
like bell sleeves what are these sleeves
bell sleeves no not bell-bottoms what we
just have some loose sleeves and I like
that it's flowy summertime vibes and
again having leaves on it because I was
feeling real tropical and I just feel
like I want to wear this like to the
beach honestly I'll wear this anywhere
but I just like this is so pretty good
guys with traveling anywhere like it
looks so good on next up I have this set
which I'm really obsessed with because I
love sets that are just solid colors
that I can wear either the shorts with
something else or at the top with
something else so I'll just show you
guys it's a stop going bad but it's this
white set love the shorts they have like
these little I don't know what these are
called I was gonna say scalloped I don't
think that's the right word basically
just like this detailing on the bottom
that I love and then the top actually
matches that and it has ruffles all
along in its halter kind of and it has
an open back and you just tie it this is
so pretty and I love this again because
you could wear just the top with like
high-waisted jeans or a high-waisted
skirt and you can wear this completely
separately then you would wear the
shorts and you could also wear the
shorts separately then you would wear
the top so I can pair this with
like in this purple top it would be a
completely different look what I also
really like is that all these girls are
almost under $100 so that's amazing
next up I have no idea where I'm going
to wear this I saw it and I was like
that's just so pretty like I just really
need it I don't know where I'm gonna
wear this I wish I was going to Hawaii
this summer so I could like wear this to
dinner or something but it is this super
tropical looking dress it's green and
pink the pink is like a light I don't
know how to describe this peak I love it
it has like a deep V ish down the middle
what is this opening called I don't
really know but it's open back which I
think makes it so much prettier
I love open back things I don't know why
I just think they look so flattering
your hair tied up and just like an open
back dress I just think that's so pretty
so I love this super super tropical
vibes I know I'm like where am I gonna
go in this because I need this is like a
reason to travel it's like so I can take
it it's your picture just in this dress
next up I really really need some denim
shorts and anbu they have so many
varieties of dinner trips they also like
restock the site with like thousands of
new clothes every week so it's really
good for that if you look one week and
you're like oh whatever you can always
go back the next week and they have more
clothes on there so the first pair is
just these white denim shorts which I
have never had a pair of white denim
shorts I know that's so good but I
always will look everywhere and try to
find them and they don't fit me right
the waist is weird or it like has too
many holes in it it just looks awkward
but these fit me perfectly I'll see it
put size that I get these and I'll link
it down below whatever size I got this
in because I know you guys always ask me
about what size I am so I'll link it
down below what sighs I gotta knees
because they fit me perfectly like
literally they're the most perfect white
shorts I'm like God blessed because I
really needed them and you need to have
denim shorts for summer they're just
staple items so then I also got these
demux they're like distressed in the
front which I really love and I just
always need denim shorts because I wear
one pair and in the summer you're like
sweating and it like gets weird like and
like
Jerian of denim shorts you don't wear
them again the next day because then
they're worn out and the jeans are just
like stretched out so you need multiple
pair of dentures so I got these again I
will also link the size of these down
below as well as all the rest of the
clothes and size I got in them that's it
for this track all guys I hope you guys
like it don't forget to check out boo
