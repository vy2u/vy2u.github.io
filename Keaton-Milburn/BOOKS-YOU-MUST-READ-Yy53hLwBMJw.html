week's video is books you must read I
have been reading a lot lately I've read
a ton this year I mean I've always read
but this year especially I've read a ton
of books so I decided to make a video of
books you must read because I love
sharing which books I've read and like
encouraging other people to read with
that being said let's get this started
and I will show you all the books I've
read and books that you need to read the
first ones I'm gonna start with the
series and of course this one's kind of
popular
it's the Maze Runner series I don't have
the first book to The Maze Runner but
this is the second book it's called the
Scorch Trials and then the third book is
the death cure The Maze Runner series is
by James Dashner and I love these books
I read them like super quick like they
they're really good there are um
somewhat Hunger Games II um there's a
genre and it's Sisto peein fiction and
that's kind of what these are like
so I really recommend those books those
are really good and yeah on another
topic this book um if I stay this one is
by Gayle Forman and this was also kind
of popular right now this book I read
really quick I was a huge huge fan of it
but every other person that I've talked
to has really really liked it and
there's a movie coming out which I'm
really excited about because the movie
actually looks kind of better than the
book the book but the book is still
really good and every person who has
read it has been really interested in it
I think it was just me personally maybe
I wasn't really focused when I was
reading it but um
definitely recommend this book and then
of course um I'm gonna talk about john
green's books i read i don't have them
with me because I learned out all of my
books but I read The Fault in Our Stars
about two years ago
and that was that device bar my favorite
book I've ever read and I've read a lot
of books and I feel like that is the
best book on the planet and I'm not just
saying that because it's super popular
right now
because I mean I did read it two years
ago and it's always been my favorite
like no matter what so I really
recommend that by John Green and then
this one is actually my favorite book by
John Green
it's Paper Towns and this one I was just
I don't know why I just like really
likes it a lot I just kind of I don't
know I just got really attached to this
book and I love this one so this is my
favorite John Green Book and then The
Fault in Our Stars and then Looking for
Alaska was also a really really good one
and then he has another one which is the
abundance of katherines that one if I'm
being completely honest I love John
Green he saw my favorite author but I
love him um but the abundance of
katherines just wasn't really for me I
just wasn't really interested in it but
definitely recommend Paper Towns and all
the recipes books so this book is 13
reasons why by Jay Asher which is also
pretty popular a lot of these books are
pretty popular right now but
weapon or so I'm suggesting them now
this one 13 reasons why is somewhat
depressing but at the same time um as
you read it it will make you think a lot
about how you treat other people what
you say how your actions affect other
people and this book I really thought
was like really eye-opening and at the
same time it's super interesting to hear
the story in this book it's pretty much
about a girl who has committed suicide
and she has left tapes - she's left
tapes describing reasons why or events
that have happened that led to her
committing suicide and it actually is
super interesting and not as depressing
as it sounds it's really cool so I
suggest this book 13 reasons why I buy -
okay so before I start on these next
books I just want to tell you this is by
far my favorite dystopian fiction series
geology whatever it's called books these
are my favorite I don't know I just I
can't I don't even know how to put it
but these are definitely books you must
read if you've read divergent insurgent
or Allegiant then you need to read these
books because I read the divergent
series
I didn't read Allegiant but I read the
first two and I'm telling you these what
did I just so on these books are by far
my favorite I like them so much better
than divergent so this series
here this series is the Shatter Me
series so here I'll just show it is by I
really don't know how to pronounce their
name this is the person if you search
shatter me it'll be the first book I
promise
pretty much it's also another dystopian
fiction whatever type of book someone
just for I jump into my house and I'm
feeling a little really awkward right
now so pretty much like the world is in
a bad situation and there's a society
and people are like in the society kind
of Hunger Games II but it's not it's so
much better than that and of course
every book has a love interest so this
love interest is great and I promise you
if you get the first book just go ahead
and buy the second one and buy the third
one I'm telling you you're gonna want to
read them all they're amazing and yeah
that's it
so those are all the books that I have
recommended for you guys to read I hope
this video was kind of helpful if you're
interested in reading if you're not
maybe you'll get into reading some more
but I really really loved these books
and I hope that you read them and that
you love them to you if you have any
books that you love that I haven't
listed here please comment them in the
comments below because I love finding
new books like my favorite thing anyway
guys that's all thank you guys so much
for watching and stay tuned for next
