yes I'm holding the camera I really I
didn't feel like like sending it down
like doing all this stuff so I'm holding
it right now um anyways okay so this
week's video is pretty much a
before-and-after I like let me just
explain myself the past two videos you
have seen take my hat off you have seen
my crazy route they're like grown out
I've been trying to grow my roots out
because I really wanted to have like a
brown darker hair on the top too like
here you know but it just it's not
really working and it just looks like
really nasty growing out roots so today
I decided I'm just gonna go get it died
and so I'm dyeing my hair like I'm
purposely putting brown dye into my hair
and that's like a really big step for me
because I know I would never die my hair
brown anything like that um it's gonna
be mostly blonde like it'll be blonde
from like here down or whatever but it's
gonna pretty much be kind of all braids
but just like up there whatever I don't
dye my hair I never like want to go
brunette just because I could never
picture myself like that so this is like
a super except for me guys so I am
filming me going and like it getting my
hair down and like all that stuff and
you can see how stressed I am because
this is very stressful for me but yeah
so I hope you guys enjoy this video and
give it a thumbs up if you liked it
so this is what my hair looks like
and um it's really pretty
I guess ah the color is really pretty
but the picture I showed him basically
looks nothing like this um I pretty much
wanted to ombre my hair I wanted to do
the top like these roots right here
to about here I wanted to do it like
dark and like faded and then like the
end from like here down I wanted it like
bleach blonde
as you can see it's like all brown
pretty much we are going back to Tony
and we are going to get my hair fixed
because it looks really crazy I guess we
will see what it looks like afterwards
because
but you don't have to get that close

no but honestly we should get some Taco
Bell that's a real it's a real thing I

final yeah okay anyway that was my
adventure live my hair looks like now my
