with one of my friends his name is
Travis and he takes like a lot of really
really good pictures so we are driving
to downtown Houston I pick him up right
now there he is ah Travis Travis so
pretty much we're going to go to the
park it's so then we're just going to
take a few there and they do a quick
change and then let's go to the hell
just reeling the duckling it's like
right there's street
looking forward and it just got off it's
not the freaking parking garage I'm
gonna change outfits for out of ours i
was running up the stairs I thought
worry
ok we are going to discover 3 now so
that's like a big part in the toilet
and I message
you know this is lunch eyes you know
seriously ok so we're home now and it is
915 we left my house i left my house at
four fifteen today so it's about five
hours so we drove to you soon there was
tons of traffic and stuff but we're back
now I'm just going to asleep and
literally pass out I literally made
jameel go through every single door of
my house we went through every single
room and every single light is on in my
house because I hate staying home alone
whenever I get the pictures back from
the shoot I'll probably leave them in
this video like it'll slide show if you
guys are wondering where the clothes
that I wore in the video are from
they're all from brandy melville and I'm
going to tag them in my Instagram post
so falling on ice cream if you want to
see those um yeah that did I'm gonna go
