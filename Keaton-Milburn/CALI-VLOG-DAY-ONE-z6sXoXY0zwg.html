day time thought the first day that I'm
vlogging up Stella kappa sleep um
this is my lovely outfit for the airport
just like an oversized t-shirt i think
it's a men's t-shirt beds comfortable um
the reason i have makeup on you're
probably wondering why do you have
makeup on at 6 o'clock in the morning to
go to the airport because i filmed the
video last night and then i fell dead
asleep after editing and uploading it so
i am dead
um by the time you're watching this the
video will already be uploaded it's
actually uploading right now because
it's stupid so that's the video it's the
what's in my carry-on so i did that and
it's 7 o'clock in the morning right now
we're about to go to the airport we need
to leave at 7:30 like by 7:30 because we
have to get the airport check-in and i
want coffee and breakfast
speaking of coffee Carly I know that
you're probably watching this video
because you know my best friend and you
watch all my videos and you sent me back
a card that has Starbucks gift card in a
Taco Bell gift card and I was so excited
not even because of the gift card just
because it is so nice that you sent me a
letter back if you guys didn't know I
picked her for the Valentine's Day
Giveaway and she sent me a letter back
and I just thought it was really really
nice
