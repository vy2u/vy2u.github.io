and we're gonna film and then I think
we're just gonna hang out I don't know
what we're gonna do we're going to get
lunch and stuff like that it's kind of
ugly outside right now but I think it
should get prettier it just looks really
really foggy and gross Hannah over here
is dying we both feel really sick I
don't feel as sick as her because I
think she got me sick
I don't know for sick but yesterday she
wasn't feeling fabulous and she was like
sniffling and coughing and she was
sneezing like all day and then I woke up
this morning it's like I feel congested
and my throat hurts both of our throats
hurt and I don't know I think we're both
sick hannah has this thing in her mouth
and it like basically is it open your
drawer close it it opens her jaws I'm
gonna vlog me having to do it
waking it okay
we're going to meet Hannah pretty pumped
meet Ali yeah you punked me and Ali
she's really perfect
I feel like you look so cute these look
like sour patch tequila we're going to
earth cafe nano and I have like shoes
and clothes because I am elevator did
I'm for real
I do it every single time and I have
like shoes and clothes is that because
my photo shoot is that three o'clock and

this is the Patrona pizza I believe
there's our quesadillas we did not
expect this much food it's cramping
service okay if you guys are wondering
where I'm doing my photo I'm doing
it at Ace Hotel and then I think we're
gonna shoot somewhere else
I just put Halley's lip plumpers esta
I'm sitting here like this I just
learned how is lip plumping stuff on my
lips like they're tingling so much are
they actually making my lips any bigger
though like I feel like they've made it
am I just imagining it
it's just tingling like we are next to a
murderer next anymore but he's next to
us he was in a van and they had gloves
on and it's cuz he can't get his
fingerprints on the wheel because he
probably doesn't murder someone he's
like the creepiest man and then we made
and my mom drove away hey I don't like
this he's right oh he's good mom he
can't come to us they're taking pictures
today we actually are at the Ace Hotel
yeah we kind of actually already got
kicked out from the roof so we went on a
different floor so we can take different
pictures but this is the window we're
taking pictures at by the way because
someone's gonna ask me what I'm gonna be
like I don't know but yeah we're taking
pictures and we're going to go to
another awesome we want to all the way
to free me Africa and then a car pulled
up was it a shot so
we're gonna walk all the way back to
where we first went to yeah I like that
yeah we're gonna go to Urban Outfitters
and shoot so
okay so I finished my shoot and now I
look so ratchet and I'm like tired I
don't know why I'm born Urban Outfitters
and it's so hard to shop in Urban
Outfitters because first of all
everything is so expensive and also and
also it's like I want every single thing
in here so it's hard to pick one thing
because then I feel like I'm hating on
everything else but I really want
everything within it so expensive okay
so we're back at the hotel now we went
to milk but my GoPro died while we were
there so I didn't get to film everything
we got but it's super late now well not
really lately but it's 11 o'clock and it
just feels like this day has been like a
week long so we're gonna go to bed now
say goodnight and I will see you guys
tomorrow wait what did you get
oh my gosh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
