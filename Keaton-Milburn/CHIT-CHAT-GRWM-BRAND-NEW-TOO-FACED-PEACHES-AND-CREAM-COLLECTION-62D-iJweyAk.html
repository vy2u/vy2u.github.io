to be a get ready with me and I'm going
to be showing you guys the new two-faced
peaches and cream collection so I am so
so excited to be a part of this whole
thing and get to show you guys all the
new products because a few months ago if
you guys know I went and I actually shot
a lot of the stuff for the new peaches
and cream collection and they got just
like play with all the products before
they came out it's so crazy to be able
to work with Too Faced because to face
was actually the very first makeup brand
that I ever ever bought like at Sephora
like on my own I bought the natural eye
shadow palette and it was the first like
thing that I bought at Sephora on my own
to even like have them send me items and
like get to shoot for them and like show
you guys like how to use their new
products is so awesome because I
absolutely love everyone at Too Faced
don't forget to follow me on all my
social media to keep updated with what
I'm doing because I am back in Arizona I
am at college again so if you guys want
to know what I'm doing what I'm doing
out here in the desert of Arizona you
guys can go follow me on my Instagram
and my Twitter so without me talking any
more let's get into the video I am so
excited to be filming this video like
literally I got the package today and I
was like I cannot wait to film like I
actually have to film today so I'm super
excited to show you guys all this new
stuff so the first thing I'm going to be
using is the primed and peachy cooling
matte skin perfecting primers so this is
amazing so I was gonna honestly do like
a first impressions of this video but
then I remembered like I did the whole
shoot for this in the beginning of
summer so I was like it's not a first
impressions I've used them before
because I like smelt all the stuff and
like got to play with it all when I did
the Too Faced shoot but this is it here
it is it's cute and peachy so I'm just
gonna prime my face with this and
honestly feels so moisturizing on my
skin but at the same time it's
mattifying which i think is a really
really cool concept I always always love
moisturizers and primers that do that I
just think it's awesome so I love this
and obviously everything smells like
peach like it's literally like a dream
come true to have your makeup smell like
peach okay so I'm honestly not sure what
skin tone I am because I don't have any
spray tan on right
and normally I'm natural beige but that
is obviously a little too dark for me so
I'm either warm nude or I'm nude I think
I'm gonna go with nude because I'd
rather be like to light and bronze it up
then to dark and like add a lot of
concealer you know what I mean so we're
going to use everything is Larry's still
in the package so this is the peach
perfect comfort matte foundation so if
you guys love you Born This Way
Foundation which I absolutely love the
Born This Way Foundation I wear it
almost every single day that one is a
more luminous coverage and it's also
more medium to full but this one is
actually a matte foundation which i
think is awesome especially because I
live in Arizona and it is literally so
hot I'm sweating all day I want matte
foundation now I don't really want
luminous foundation it just depends on
my mood but absolutely love this so I'm
gonna have to pump this I really really
hope this is my color because I honestly
don't know it's actually a really good
color for me it looks almost like a
little bit dark think I could go almost
lighter but I think it'll work I mean I
have a lighter color should I do a
lighter color X shade down from this one
is vanilla and I honestly don't know if
I'm Vanilla
I don't think I'm that light but let me
just let me just try it out
I like use this foundation so long ago
that I forgot how it was and I am so
excited every time I film in front of a
window um it always makes my neck in my
face I cannot look like it matte but I
promise in real life it does match it's
just so annoying on camera yeah I like
how this fundation turned out also I'm
really not sure if this set up right
here where I'm filming is gonna stay the
setup all year I'm just like testing it
out for my first video um but I'm going
in with the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and I'm just going to
highlight and
my eyes I have a pimple on my chin I
actually I have a lot of pimples on my
chin and I don't want them here anymore
so I did they just put so much you can
see you later on my chin but it's fine I
literally look like a woman
great okay now that that's done I'm
going to go in with this NYX wonder
stick and I lightly lightly contour so
I'm gonna do just a little along here I
honestly am not very good at contouring
but I just like to cream contour eye
cream contour every day literally guys
this is probably one of the best
foundations I have ever use like I've
never seen my skin look more flawless
like it's just so perfectly Matt right
now like it literally looks like I set
my face with powder I'm not even joking
with you guys this next product by Too
Faced this is the translucent
translucent translucent I'm smoothing
finished powder this is probably what I
am most excited about out of this whole
collection because I have never been
like a more shocked in my life at a
product like actually you know when I
show you the blushes you'll be like
shook but they use this I like you use
this on set and it was so amazing like
set my under eyes with this powder and
I'm telling you right now
it literally wears everything like I
wish you guys could see it on camera but
I don't even think it's picking it up
that I look like this does that make
sense this is a really good way to
describe this you know I'm like facetune
or like Photoshop when you take the
smoothing thing and you smooth out your
whole face that's like what this does
but in real life like it literally blurs
everything like by and it going with you
mattifying news setting powder because
they do have a new setting powder we're
taking everything out of the packages
but I just want to
that my face because may I know my face
isn't a hat but like I always I actually
ran out of my Anastasia brow Wiz and so
I found this in my drawer it's islur
this is the it's just like another brow
pomade and it works really really good
it is in the she blonde yeah blonde so
I'm now going to set my brows with the
Ready Set brow this is actually from
European wax inner that's where I get my
eyebrows waxed
I got good wax today so they're like
super flaky like thank God they are not
a rat's nest because they were so bad
this morning like I walked in there and
I was like I am so sorry that you're
having to wax these like this is
embarrassing but this is the just peachy
mattes is the velvet matte eyeshadow
palette by Too Faced this is also in
their peaches-and-cream collection so
this palette is actually so balm I also
love the packaging like it's heavy it
feels really sturdy also the mirror is
really big on this like what an amazing
beautiful product so there are 1 2 3 4
incident 12 different shades in here and
I think they're perfect for any kind of
look you wanted to do what you want to
do a really peachy look because they do
have this one they've just peachy they
have peach punch it fresh packed peaches
and cream they have those shoots but
they also have really pretty neutrals
the peach tart and the peach cobbler
like these 3 up here beautiful for like
a nude eye so I'm kinda I like the shirt
that I'm wearing I wanted to try and do
a peachy look but I kind of feeling like
a brown like smokier kind of look so
let's see what we go for today this is
the fresh picked color right here it's
like a peachy nude color I don't know it
looks really pretty
really about this I kind of want to add
a more pink color so I'm gonna go in
with this Just Peachy
and I'm gonna put it closer to the brow
like right at the top of where I put
that other color just to make it like a
little more okay so for all over the lid
I mixed peach tea and peach cobbler
which are these two shades right here
and then actually looks really really
pretty almost looks like Capri which I'm
really really actually love actually
gonna mimic that on the bottom so I'm
just gonna go back in with peach cobbler
and peach tea and I'm gonna do the lower
lash line I'm actually gonna go in with
me to face sweet peach palette like the
first one that I just had myself with
this with it cool cool it's fine I'm
fine
I'm gonna go home with this and I love
nectar and this isn't even just because
I'm like doing this whole toothpaste
video any time I'm using a different eye
shadow palette but I want to do a
highlight on the brow in the inner
corner I always take this palette out
and use a nectar I think it's the best
like for how bones shade and like such a
good highlighting shade so I'm gonna put
this there you know
so I'm gonna go in with black eyeliner
this is actually by Clinique this is a
pretty easy liquid eyeliner pen and I've
been using this recently and I stopped
using it for a while because I stopped
using black eyeliner but I'm back into
it oh I don't know why but I really want
to go back in with this color right here
it's more purpley it's going just right
and for some reason I kind of want this
in the outer corner going in if you like
my eye shadow just needed like a little
something and this is like the prettiest
shade ever and it blends really easy
like it looks purple on the palette but
like it doesn't look that purple on the
Isaac it blends okay so now I'm going in
with my Too Faced better than sex
mascara because what other mascara would
I use like honestly my lashes are
basically invisible before I just put
this mascara me oh my god don't you hate
when you're gonna put your mascara in
the tube and you miss the tube and then
you just get black mascara everywhere
because okay so now I'm going on with a
Too Faced sweetiepie radiant matte
bronzer so this is the bronzer I
honestly don't remember using this for
the shoot so I'm very excited to
actually test this out but it's called
sweetie pie like how freaking cute is
that and look at it it looks so so
pretty I'm gonna go in with this I
normally like I haven't been hardcore
like contouring much so I'm just gonna
go in with this Sephora brush
well that's a really pretty shade like
that's good for my skin I thought it was
gonna be like too dark because I don't
have a spray tan right now that's
actually a good shade for me like if I
didn't know too much it might be it
might be almost overboard but that's
really pretty
okay I see you sweetie pie okay guys
this is the most exciting thing that I
think I'm gonna show you guys I keep
saying that about every product I'm not
even kidding I'm genuinely so excited to
be sharing all this stuff with you also
there's not a fire my room that's a
candle and that's it yeah that's a
candle also in case you're wondering
that's Brandon Wolfe Elle's book and
there's a candle not certainly get it
like it's like because he's so like oh
okay that was a bad job so what's really
cool about these is that they are
melting powder blushes so first of all
look at the packaging stop it's a
freaking peach and each little leaf is
like the color of the shade so what
these are I'm trying to like I'm trying
to explain this to you but you guys
honestly just have to buy it to get it
guys can see it looks like chapstick
like it looks like it has that glassy
texture which it does so when you guys
are when you touch it like this it feels
like an EOS Bowl you know what I'm
saying but like watch when I put it on
my skin like it turns into powder does
that make sense to you guys like I'm
going to rub my finger on this I'm
rubbing my finger a lot like a la boîte
so you would think when I put this on my
face it's gonna be like a big mark but
watch it turns into powder like it's
powder it's gone it's like it's so cool
guys I've never been more sure than my
life honestly okay so now for a
highlight I'm going in with this glossy
a glossy or whatever Hollis Copic I
don't never know how to say their name I
don't wanna mess it up but I'm just
gonna take my finger and I'm gonna
lightly put it on this stick it honestly
gives you such a natural glow so I'm
gonna
put it on my cheekbones honestly you can
also go just directly on the face but I
always like get scared I'm gonna put too
much so I like to blend it out with my
finger or something like that I was
watching I don't know hoops it wasn't
and go was desease and you Kim
Kardashian's makeup tutorial cuz she was
saying she like puts highlight here on
the center for forehead where most
people would set their face and she said
like it adds so much more and she also
does her chin so of course if Kim
Kardashian tells me to do something I'm
going to do it so now I put highlighter
right here and on my chicken I'm going
in with these spice lip liner because I
thought that I lost it and by moving to
Arizona but I found it so we're back on
board people so the peaches and cream
also actually has three different lip
colors so these are the peach kiss they
are moisture matte long wearing
lipsticks so there's three shades this
one is like I'm more very shade this one
is a more Brown and this is like a
really pretty nude so I think I'm gonna
go with the nude because I'm not like I
don't branch out that much so this shade
is called Dollface this is a cute little
container is um also it's really close
up these lips when you like to kissed I
can't talk today twist them up they have
peaches like all over the lipstick which
I'm actually very impressed like this is
they smell good too this is very like
moisture matte like I was thinking it
was just gonna be like matte even though
it says moisture matte but it's like
very creamy Wow
I really like that and last say if you
guys know to face that she just came out
with like The Hangover a setting spray
but they used this on me on set and I
was like I'm dying I want this now I
wanted it so bad like I didn't want to
have to wait months for it but this is
the peach miss mattifying setting spray
so this is a setting spray that actually
helps keep it matte it doesn't make you
look oily and really really wet it like
helps so so much in a smells like
peaches so like obviously so I'm going
to set my face with this really quickly
so guys this is the final look actually
really like the way this looks I'm
actually like really really happy
because now I can go out of my makeup
it's gonna look bum it looks like so
natural but also it looks like you know
what you're doing with makeup if that
makes sense because a lot of times when
I try to go for a more natural look I
try to use like minimum product because
I think that that makes me look more
natural but sometimes makeup like this
like a matte foundation and blurring
powder can really really help you
achieve a more natural look but also
like the contour and eyeshadow makes you
look like you know what you're doing
which i think is really awesome so I
actually really really love this so I
will link everything down below please
go check out two-faced I'm so excited to
be even like a part of this whole like
thing that they're doing because it's so
amazing absolutely love the peaches and
cream collection it comes out August
31st so you guys can go get it I will
