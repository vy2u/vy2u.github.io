to be a chit chat you're ready with me
and I'm so excited to film this video
because I have so many new makeup
products obviously I just uploaded and
makeup politic eyes are new to my
channel you might want to go check it
out because pretty good a lot of makeup
but yes I have so much new makeup and I
have a lot of makeup I didn't actually
show in that video that I've just got so
I'm really excited to show it you guys
so let's get started so I am priming my
face with the makeup forever step one
skin equalizer this is the smoothing
primer which I love this stuff so I put
it on my forehead and right here whoa
looking great you guys have really been
liking more casual videos lately so I
figured I would do a chitchat you're
right oh geez I feel like I haven't done
this in a while and I'm wearing an off
the shoulder top obviously I'm not naked
next up this is my favorite thing this
is the Mac strobe cream this is like a
hydrating cream and I'm obsessed with
this stuff guys it's amaze so I just put
it on my hand like this oh and then rub
it around its really really shiny just
look at that oh it's amazing
so I put it oh my oh god I put too much
on my cheekbones and I put it on my
forehead oh my nose
everywhere I would normally highlight I
put this and all on my cheeks but like
it just gives you a natural glow it's
just like I love liquid highlighters
they're the best the next product I
talked to you guys about in my haul it
is the our last stick foundation this is
my new Holy Grail I'm not kidding it's
not an exaggeration I look like the
lighting is like super weird so I'm
sorry that it's like dark on this side I
have a window over here but this is the
only way I could like film so just like
bear with me on that but anyway this is
a stick foundation I am in the shade
beige I obviously have a spray tan right
now my face is like a little splotchy
over
play this all over all girl I know it
looks crazy but guys I promise this is
going to blend out I'm using my Sigma
flat kabuki brush my F 80 this is
amazing and I am just blending this out
so I think the reason I like this so
much is because I have the Make Up For
Ever HD stick which is a lot more full
coverage like you can still build this
foundation up to full coverage but the
other one it was like just straight-up
like cake your face and sometimes I
don't want that so I go in with this
stick foundation and its really really
blendable so it doesn't feel like you're
like applying like so much foundation
and guys I know I look orange right now
but I promise it all comes together in
the end you know me I will I'll get it
together by the end of this video
next I'm going to go in with the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer you guys all
thought I was going to say the shape
tape but I don't own that because I
wasn't really in the loop and it was
sold out everywhere so I never got that
um
so I'm using naked concealer and my face
looks so Orange I promise it's going to
come together guys I don't look like
this in person I keep my skin tone
matching I like to heavily apply this
obviously it's not like a subtle like
concealer it's like hi so I might as
well coat my whole face it's fine
also quick tip if your Beautyblender is
not wet enough I'm using the Smashbox
photo finish primer I'm that's great on
there because my Beauty Blender it was
not damp oh that's so much better
it literally is amazing okay so next you
guys going to do that Keaton does enough
okay but I'm going to go in with the
Lumi cushion into shade c8 which is that
my skin shade nose is kidding
so I'm going to contour with this it is
a foundation it is I have this and like
my regular skin shade but I got it in a
dark shade because I wanted to use it to
contour and I've been using it and I
love it so if you guys want to know I am
going in lightly with the tip of my
Beauty Blender and gonna put it here and
it's just so simple and so blendable
because it's a foundation so I'm just
like this is a great idea
I think I saw someone's video and they
did this and I was like you're right
also do you see that glow that is from
the Mac strobe that I have underneath my
foundation it's amazing I'm always like
yeah I'm going to go for like a really
natural look today and then like the
second I started doing my makeup it's
like no please beat your face like do
all like I just turned so extra so that
it's like a super simple way to cream
contour if you guys don't know I was
always super scared to cream contour
like because I would see in serum videos
and they would be like carving every
ounce of their face but a little cream
contour in the cheeks the forehead I
think it's good
a little cream contour never hurt people
now we're gonna bake because I cannot
not bake my face I know a lot of people
they just do it every once in a while I
bake my face every day because my
undereyes crease really really easily
and it gets really frustrating and I
look really bad and I just don't like it
so I need to make my face every day or
at the least like set my face but for
the most part I bake every day not an
extravagant amount but like you know
also if you guys have an oily its
forehead I highly suggest setting your
forehead and the place that I sweat them
most is my chin which is really weird so
I always set my chin with a lot of
powder and like make sure nothing moves
because you know we don't need that in
our lives I do my brows the Anastasia
brow Wiz and the shade medium brown
they're bushy they need to be fixed but
we're going to go with it because not
everyone is blessed with good brows so
the main reason I want to film this
video and this is not sponsored so don't
come for me in the comments but I got a
package sent in at the state new
colour-pop nectar collection which is so
cute because I mean like come on now
like the packaging the shades are
beautiful so I really want to try out
the eyeshadow palette there are four
shades in this I can read you the shades
I think do they happen they're really
prettiest obviously like all like peach
toned and no I thought it was really
pretty so I want to try it out today and
because I never go out of my comfort
zone of like brown news so I thought you
know what maybe we'll go into the peach
so I'm going to use I'm going to use
issues because I have issues yeah okay
so I'm going to go all over the lid with
the shade to set now I'm going to mix
issues and this pink shade next to it I
don't know what it's called but I'm
going to put these in my crease just cuz
why not guys I really like this actually
this is really pigmented and I really
like the peach like I never do a peach
look I'm kind of into this Wow guys now
I think to deepen it up I'm going to go
on with the darkest pink shade and I'm
going to like focus this on the crease
because I don't freaking know don't
laughs I'm going with this metallic
shade right here and I don't know what
the name of that is but you know I don't
know the names of any of these but I'm
going to put this on the center oh my
god guys I fell pretty I'm going to gym
you guys in you guys don't understand
now I'm going to wake away wake away
wipe away the bacon because I don't want
to get too ashy so I'm just gonna I'm
also going to quickly apply the Urban
Decay glut
you can't talk Urban Decay glide on
pencil and whiskey and I've been using
this it's like almost gone oh my gosh
this thing is so sharp I'm not just stab
myself that's not a good idea should I
do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it
guys youtuber uses harp I pencil the
time I almost went blind I'm not I am
applying the Smashbox
indecent exposure mascara which is like
a new favorite of mine because it's
really black and it has thickness but
still like bliss my lashes up which i
think is awesome so you know what's not
awesome that that also I was just like
hyping up this mascara and then I
literally just put it all over my cheek

like the whole lawn like that's the
whole lawn right there all right well if
