you drove me talk about unfed you owe me
top I don't talk about the lies you told
me talk about you colors you show me how
back down
Tom how crazy our joy talk about crazy
Joe
go buy this castle on the hill fight
Sharon go buy it
what's up guys so yes my hair is very
curly today I was trying it out and I
literally just curled it like 30 minutes
ago and so it needs to die down a bit
more but I really wanted my hair very
curly I don't know why I never film
videos with my hair like this so I was
like you know what we're gonna do this
is how it's going today's video is going
to be a chitchat get ready with me but
instead of doing my entire face I am
just going to be showing you guys my
eyes with the peach palette because you
guys have requested this so so much so
that is what I'm doing today I'm sorry
I'm not doing my whole face routine I
did film an everyday makeup routine and
I literally still do it every single day
so you guys want to know how I got my
whole face like this go check that out
because I am just doing my eyes in this
video but I will link it down below it's
actually pretty good if I do say so
myself okay moving on
also this is the last time I'm filming
the video back home in Texas so from
here on out the videos will be back in
Arizona in my dorm room which is really
sad because we're gonna see how you know
I work with this dorm room situation as
you guys already know I'm not a very
good like I don't know I'm not like I
honestly just do whatever I want so
these colors are so gorgeous and it
smells really pretty but I can't really
do anything super fancy with it I'm just
gonna do what I would normally do also I
am going to my church later tonight to
work a blood drive and so I don't really
want to have like full glam eyes on when
I'm going to like work a blood drive but
people are gonna be really concerned
plus my hair is already like this so
they're gonna be like where did you come
from but all of these eyeshadow colors
are beautiful it really it truly makes
me emotional I don't know if I set my
I did it let me just do that I'm going
in with peaches and cream and setting my
eyelid uh but yeah I'm going to my
church tonight and they're literally
gonna be like girl like who told you to
come looking like this I really really
wanted to do green eyes with the bless
her heart color up here but I don't even
think I'm gonna like green with purple I
always try and wear green with purple
air and I just look like Barney it just
never works we're gonna take this puree
color which is a really good transition
 also I know this has a lot of crazy
colors in it but this is honestly such a
good palette for any look or trying to
do like I can do so many things with
just one palette and that makes me so
happy I have the chocolate bar palette
and that's probably like that was my
go-to for like three years
um so every time to face comes out the
palette I'm like yes this is exactly
what I want okay so I'm just gonna put
this in the crease and blend it out I'm
sorry guys aren't clothes that's because
I suck at like even I can't even focus
myself in from like far away much less
like closer
lemme oh my god now you're a little too
close I feel like you can see everything
like in you are singing into my soul
today guys I literally like because I'm
on break and I know that when I go back
to school it's gonna be so hard to film
videos I'm sayin I need to film as much
as I can while I'm home and that's what
I did and a lot of you guys were
tweeting me and you guys are like girl
yes you did so good and I was like thank
you like I really tried okay I'm taking
this Sephora
thirty eight brush I'm taking summer
young just take me a little bit it's a
little bit orange II I always use orange
I don't know what my problem is but I'm
gonna try and put this just in the
crease and then a little bit more up I
don't really want to get it on the whole
lid I mean I can't really do a crack a
crease I can't even say cut crease I
can't really do a cut crease which is
why like I'm not even gonna attempt but
this is almost gonna be like that but
like a little bit like below fashion
like this is gonna be like a cut crease
like you know you chose pictures on
Twitter that are like Walmart voice
versus whatever that's me that's my
whole eye that's what I'm going for
I'm the Walmart and every other regrew
is like the Gucci charmed I'm sure which
is I'm gonna put this in the crease as
well and up I'm gonna
just keepin it up I want it to be like a
defined line like a cut crease but not
you I want to take lucious oh yes guys
did you see how pigmented that was like
can we oh my god this is so pretty I was
kind of worried cuz like you don't know
what you're doing but I never know what
I'm doing and it just works out so I'm
also gonna put all this like in the
inner corner where it's just like super
highlighted okay but I want to make it
deeper again like I need this upper part
deeper so again I'm gonna go in this one
summary of all the colors I mean all the
names of the colors in this palette are
so cute like everything is so peachy and
just cute like I'm gonna take nectar
which is this color it's like the
perfect highlight color I'm gonna put it
underneath my brow bone and just
highlight that
you see that okay honestly guys like let
me know how you're doing in the comments
like let me know what are you what are
your favorite type of videos to see like
what do you guys enjoy most when you see
me I know a lot of you guys really like
watching my blog that's why I made a
vlog channel because you guys are like
these aren't the best thanks
but like what do you guys really really
like to see the most like when you come
to my channel you're like oh my god I
wish you would do this because I've been
looking at the comments and you guys
requested the Kylie Jenner unboxing
tutorial all that stuff so I did that
one because I had so many comments about
I had so many comments to do a video
with the peach palette so I was like
okay like I'll do a peach palette one
but now what do you guys want to see
what's going on what's next
let me know because I'm really taking
into consideration what you guys are
saying you guys run my channel like
really not me
you guys okay so I really quickly just
use this Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil and whiskey and I smudged it it's
kind of brown it's a good deep brown eye
smudge it on the upper lash line and the
lower lash line and then I'm going to go
in with some Maybelline the cool the
colossal Big Shot mascara and this is my
favorite now I love this I love us a lot
I'll go back to Arizona tomorrow and I
packed one checked bag on my way here
and I'm going home with three check bags
they're all like oversized too like
they're not none of them I carry on
that's how much stuff I'm bringing home
and it was honestly the worst decision
of my life I came here with two pair of
shoes and I'm leaving with like nine
alrighty guys that is the final I shadow
look I know I didn't do a full face
again I have a entire daily makeup
routine if you guys want to check that
out and see how I did my actual makeup
and all of that but I did just want to
quickly it pop in here and do this I
need to hold this little palette up
ourselves people feel when I talk about
it but yeah I just didn't want to do a
quick tutorial with this look because
you guys requesting it I know it is so
simple and like anyone can do this but
that is basically what my makeup quit
sets up my makeup is normally super
simple and nothing that's crazy glam
there are tons of other youtubers that
are awesome at that not me personally I
just like to keep it really simple and
easy this literally took me maybe five
minutes so thank you guys so much for
watching this video if you guys want to
see more videos like this please please

comments down below other videos you
guys want to see and I will see you this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
