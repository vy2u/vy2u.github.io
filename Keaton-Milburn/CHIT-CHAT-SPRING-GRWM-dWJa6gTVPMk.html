to obviously be a spring get ready with
me and I'm just going to be talking
through this because I haven't done a
video like this in quite a while
just like casually talking to you guys
so I'm going to be just like talking
through this whole thing started fits a
little long but I just wanted to or to
catch up with you guys you know it's
also I'm going to show you guys a few
new products I've really been liking a
lot just because I don't know just be
using them a lot and this is kind of
like this isn't a dramatic spring length
is just like a daily go to look for the
springs so I'm using the first thing I'm
going to do is use this a cosmetics your
skin but better CC cream or whatever and
how so has SPF 50 in it which I like
because it's getting hotter and it's
really hot in Texas and very sunny and
protect your skin guys and the smell
Beauty Blender so I'm gonna get it wet
lately when I've been using my Beauty
liquor I've been getting it like really
wet I don't know why but I don't know I
just feel like it works a little bit
better not like super what I don't know
okay so I'm pumping two little things of
this on my hand and I'm literally just
gonna like so whether you guys really
hope you can use a primer but I don't
know when I'm just like going out like
casually to like do my makeup
so on/off I'm dumb but they literally
don't know the difference between like
CC cream and BB cream so if this is like
a different someone let me know because
I always think they're like basically
the same thing so all of you guys have
been I know I just uploaded the prom get
ready with me and a lot of you guys are
already like really really loving it
like I've literally got so much good
feedback and I'm so excited to actually
be giving you guys a prom dress I know
like I've only ever done one other
giveaway but I've never really seen
anyone I mean maybe I'm dumb but I've
never really seen anyone do like the
prom giveaway and I thought it was a
really fun idea and I wish I could pick
like literally like every single one of
you to give you guys a dress but
obviously that's really expensive and I
baked properly but I don't know I just
think it's really fun and I can't wait
to the Twitter I have yet to pick the
winner but I'll tell you guys pretty
soon if you have literally no idea what
I'm talking about go watch my last video
the prom get ready with me and you'll oh
now I'm going to be concealing my
undereyes not really concealing sources
nothing really much to conceal but let's
put this all so I don't know if I've
really talked about this a lot and like
you might like think I'm lying or
something but I love this Clinique
concealer it's literally the best thing
of my life like the way it goes on is so
smooth I don't really know how to
explain it but the first time you use it
I was like this is way too thick and
like I don't know I just thought it
wasn't gonna blend out and it literally
blends so easily and it doesn't have
like a flashback it's not what it's
called thick you know when you take a
picture and it's white under your eyes
it doesn't have that all and I love it I
think it's I think it's great
after that I take my ill Shh
hey so after that I take my pure contour
stick and I don't know this is in medium
and I take this side the little contour
part tonight
you know it's messy but this is just the
way I do it so don't leave comments a my
son cuz I already know so how do you
guys watch One Tree Hill but I just
started like maybe a month ago watching
One Tree Hill and I'm on season before
and it's so good no one spoil it for me
but I'm really I really love it and I
was so against watching One Tree Hill I
don't know everyone watches it and so I
just thought no you like don't do it
don't fall under the trap but now I'm in
a trap and I love it and my favorite
character right now is Brooke so if you
guys watch what your help comment down
below your favorite characters I want to
know cuz of team do Brooke
after that I take although I'm already
pale I don't even have a contour i'm
going to take my lover's here powder i'm
putting my little beauty blender in it
and i'm just gonna i'm gonna bake cuz i
love it i love just I don't know just
something about leaving this powder on
for a really long time that makes
everything look better also some really
exciting news I am going to playlist
live so if and you guys are going well
let me know or comment down below or
even if you're not going to play this
live and you just like live in Orlando
hit me up that would be fabulous I'd
love to meet you guys if you guys aren't
going I'm not a lot of you guys at
beautycon Dallas which was so fun
because I've never been to Dallas so
I don't know I really liked it I'm
taking my Clinique superfine liner
her brows and I've been using this a lot
just because the pomade was getting
really thick and it was frustrating me
and so now I just take this out pencil
and I lightly fill it in and it works
just as well
so what I like to do is take the
concealer part of this pure cameo stick
and I just draw a line under my eyebrow
you know straighten it out like they do
on those Instagram makeup tutorials you
know I'm trying about one he was like
perfect brows and their brows are
literally like amazing yeah mine aren't
that good but you know they do this so I
take that I make this line and then I
cover my whole eyelid and I use this as
like a primer so this is how I primed
for my eye shadow light now for the eye
shadow which honestly I haven't even
thought about till this very second I
normally play on my eye shadow a little
bit more but today I have it so okay
this is what we're gonna do I'm gonna
take the tartlet in bloom palette
because this is a spring get ready with
me and it says in bloom on it and that
has some pretty colors so I'm gonna take
this flower child color which is just
like I don't know it's a neutral color
and I'm gonna set my whole eyelid so
it's not tacky from rice with the gun
sealer even though I just told you guys
to put the concealer you guys know what
I mean
now I'm taking my zoeva blending brush
in 228 and I am gonna take jet setter
and smartypants would you're just Brown
neutral colors blend them in the crease
like so now I'm gonna take a rebel which
is like this color right here it's
almost it has like a pink tint to it but
I'm gonna also put that in the crease so
now I'm slowly gonna start adding like
Pinker shades and
yes this is great I have no idea what
I'm doing but I have been liking it you
know I have powder all over my shirt
from like trying to bake myself okay
anyway now I'm gonna take that same
rebel color and I want to put this in
the crease like I'm gonna focus it click
on the actual lid you feel kind of like
that thing where you like stick this in
the inner corner and just the outer
crease and then you leave like the
center color really bright and it makes
your eyes like pop open you know that's
what I'm gonna do so I put rebel like
everywhere except for in the center you
guys couldn't tell Center is like a
white and then I'm blending it and then
I'm gonna take a leader which is like
been legit more in color and I stuck
that only in the crease and then make
sure you blend it out a lot because it's
way too dark for my life I'm gonna take
funny girl which is just a shimmery
shimmer I'm gonna put that in the very
center of my eye see you guys you see
it's great okay so that's what I'm doing
for that lid part and then now I'm going
to just wipe away the powder like I said
I just smear it all around because I
also want to set my face with it I want
to just like brush it off so I kind of
just stand around I take what's
underneath and I just keep it on the
brush love it everywhere on my face it's
great moving on I'm going to take my
hardest mascara which I've never tried
before this is gonna be a purse
impressions guys I've never tried this
so we're gonna see how it works but I
think I'm gonna like it because everyone
loves it okay
that's alright it's not the best I think
I like my roller lash mascara and my it
cosmetics my ski
better cuz this is really thick let's
use my Clinique bronzer which I'm using
well clean comments I just like this
after exact I'm going to be taking okay
I've used so many cleaning products I
should really chill out but I'm like you
doing it so I'm taking my Clinique blush
in yanqing spring and my sparkles in it
which I highly appreciate so I'm taking
the becca by jacqueline highlighters and
i'm using first two combined I take
dervish which is I don't know just a
matte lip pencil and I line my lips this
is what I want okay so I think I'm gonna
use a murder because I haven't used it
in a while I used to always wear this
and like it this summer and stuff and
now that it's spraying it I think I want
to start using it so for my hair because
I actually have extensions in right now
I really hate the way my hair looks when
it's like long it's straight with my
extensions and so I'm going to be
curling it and I'm using the newly
titan-3 and I actually have the other
new acrylic that I've had for literally
the longest time enough obsessed with it
but this one is actually like metal like
it's silver the other one is all black
and I don't know why I just like this
one a lot better and so it goes to 200
degrees it has three different barrels
so it has this smaller one and then it
has the medium one and then I'm gonna be
using the biggest one today just because
I like the way it looks the best with my
hair I don't know
with time my hair lately I wore it half
of today no I just love to look but it
looks a lot better girl so I'm going to
be like sectioning that part off and
then brushing it out and I have my
figure out this is what I use I use the
newbie brush as well but I've had this
for a really long time I just know
that's my favorite brush hair but
because this brow is so massive
I literally just take the biggest chunks
and I whoa I wrap them like this and I
it also comes with a glove but it's
right there because it's but it
literally takes like two seconds to comb
my hair like oh that's what it looks
like it's perfect
I love the new week rollers and
especially this curler because the curls
last such a long time and especially if
I have extensions I can curl my hair
like this today and if I take my
extensions out and hang them up like the
next time I go to wear my extensions are
completely curls like and I can brush
them out a hundred different times and
they still look the exact same so I love
this so I have discount codes for you

after that I'm taking the texture tease
dry touch finishing spray and I'm just
spraying this all in my hair because I
just washed my hair yesterday so it's
really clean and I don't really like the
clean hair look I like it to look like
