to be a chitchat introduce me and if
you're wondering why I sound like a
dying animal right now that is because I
asked you guys on my snapchat what you
guys want to see if you guys want to see
a chit chat get rid of me while I'm sick
which is right now which you guys all
voted for to check it running go I'm
sick which I don't really mind I just
like didn't want it to bother you guys I
just really wanted to film today I'm
going to take these little pieces out so
I look like a bold I have filmed through
makeup tutorials before I watch Europe I
filmed three makeup churros literally
all the MARTA focus so if the quality of
this video is bad it's because I'm
filming with the camera that autofocus
is me but it's not as good as my other
one anyway moving on let's get into this
shindig also the mirror that I would
normally use to do my makeup is behind
me because I'm filming for like an
aesthetically pleasing makeup so I'm
gonna hold this oh my god I look like
literally I feel like crap and look like
crap dog so the first thing I'm going to
use is this makeup from her step one
skin equalizer and this is the smoothing
primer so that's like it like yeah it
smooths your face and I literally just
put it in like one forehead but can't
breathe oh I was like eating and I
literally couldn't breathe because
remember like when I eat like I bring
out my nose but then I couldn't be on my
nose and I was eating and I feel like I
was suffocating because I couldn't
breathe I don't know that's not
important but moving on okay so you guys
know I've talked about these two scales
I've talked about these two before this
is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD and
this will cover foundation this is the
high definition foundation they don't
have this anymore so just ignore the
fact that I'm using this I only use this
because my chest is obviously difficult
in my face so I'm going to do two pumps
of this beautiful foundation this
foundation is actually really good and
then the tiniest pump of this like
orange e Fondation because that's what I
do
this is where I paint my face you see
those you see the difference in my skin
color it's okay
you see I like to go back in with my
beauty blender after because I hate the
way like foundation brushes like leave
like brush strokes on your face I hate
the way they look now I'm going in with
my pure contour stick I do makeup
tutorials out of my routine really
changes I promise it doesn't but um yeah
so highlighting the under eyes beautiful
now I'm using the con oh I almost
dropped it I got it I'm using the
contour side and I'm gonna just chisel
chisel my face I'm not even gone
there we go home so I could talk to you
guys about beautycon la because Peter
Connelly was really fun and I know I
posted like a somewhat video about it
but I wasn't really I didn't really talk
to you guys about my experience there
was so many celebrities at beautycon LA
and like it was my first time with
Beauty Connolly obviously I want to be
fangirling the whole freaking time and
Ashley Tisdale was there and I like
walked by her and I swear on my life I
think I peed just a little because I was
like it's Sharpay Evans no I'm just
kidding I'm not annoying like that but I
was like I was so in shock
she was actually sitting in front of me
I was like what is going on ER I know
finally I'm doing eyebrows my Anastacio
Tim brow um but the person I was most
excited to see was freaking Tyra Banks
guys you know if you're like a longtime
subscriber you guys know I'm the biggest
fan of America's Next Top Model and I
tried to be on it like I literally
filled out an application and the year
that I turned 18 to fill not fill out an
application for it um the show got
cancelled she cancelled the show so
that's my luck but literally she was
there and I wanted to just cry because I
wanted her to like come up to me and
like Scout me and like tell me that I am
automatically the winner of America's
Next Top Model but whatever and you guys
know I met Brianna love her she's really
really cute her husband are adorable I
love them alone so much did my eyebrows
no I'm taking my Sigma yeah this taking
this and I'm going to draw a line
underneath them and I'm gonna like
cancel out any little baby hairs that
are like trying to make my eyebrows ugly
I'm gonna just cover them bad boys up ya
know I can't breathe it sounds like I'm
crying this is so funny but like the
other day I don't even know if this is
funny this might be annoying but the
other day I was in church and like we
honor like heads like bowed or whatever
and like when your head is down you look
sick like your like nose is all running
or still the
tell me where my prank I was like and it
like sounded like I was sobbing drug
prayer

wasn't and everyone was like yeah and I
was like oh I'm sick like let me live my
life okay so I put a coconut cream which
is just a white shade and I'm just gonna
put this all over the lid I'm setting it

or they use it as like my whole entire
lid basically am I putting this in the
crease oh oh oh

darker shade and I'm putting that in
like the outer corner and in the crease
