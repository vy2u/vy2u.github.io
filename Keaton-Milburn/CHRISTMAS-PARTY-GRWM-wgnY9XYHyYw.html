to be a get ready with me for my
Christmas party that I'm having I have
an annual Christmas party on my house
every single year so I'm going to be
getting ready for it and you guys will
see how I get this look and also where I
get my top and my jewelry and stuff like
that all time with you guys all that

I am almost at 400 K which I'm so
excited about so if you guys wanna hit

guys don't get annoyed with me after
watching this entire video if you guys
still like me go buggin Instagram and
Twitter because I'll be posting all
month of December when I'm doing and
stuff like that so and that with me
talking let's get right into the video
alrighty I know it looks kind of naked
but I do have this tube top on it's
actually a body suit it's from Urban
Outfitters in case you guys are
wondering and both of my necklaces are
from them jewelers I'll link everything
down below and my makeup I'm so excited
to be filming it should check it ready
with me I'm like I'm like giddy I don't
know why I'm filled one in a while so
I'm very excited also I just ate so much
food so my stomach right now feels like
I have a five month old baby and I I
need to go into labor pretty soon so the
first thing I'm using to prime my face
is the gloss hair rich priming
moisturizer and this is amazing I wish I
could describe the way my skin feels
with this stuff but I've been using it
every single day
and it just feels so soft and my skin it
feels like velvet it the texture of this
is amazing
mature myself up so we don't have that I
just really like the way this makes my
skin feel I don't know what to describe
this moisturizer oz but it was amazing I
was talking to like a few of the rubs
from glossier and I was talking about
this product and they were like it's
such a popular product because it's like
instantly changes your skin I highly
recommend it just don't mind my tan
right here it's so annoying and I need
to go over it with slick loving tan to
put like self-tanner over that because
following me next up because I love
glowy skin I'm using the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector this is just
it's amazing it's a literally straight
glow I just do one pump of it on my
finger but just watch how like glowy and
shiny my face looks
I am obsessive this stuff I live by it
look at the difference in my skin it's
insane
so I've been using the Too Faced peach
perfect foundation for months now I've
literally been using it I've almost used
to sit like this whole year I know it
just came out but when I did this shoot
with it for Too Faced I was obsessed it
and I've been using it like ever since
then and that was like in June or
something so I'm very in love with this
products but I really need to expand on
like what makeup I'm using because I use
a lot of the same products all the time
even though I get new makeup all the
time it's super hard for me to like
change up so if you guys have any matte
foundations that you guys are really
really liking also I know my face
doesn't match my neck shocker if you
guys have any Mac like actual matte
foundations that you guys love let me
know in the comments down below because
I really need to try out some new makeup
and I know I'm gonna get a Sephora gift
card or something for Christmas so I
might as well go buy some stuff that I
really need what are some things you
guys are asking for for Christmas I
really don't have a lot that I'm asking
for I think the only things I really did
ask for are I asked for a workout
clothes like Lululemon legging asked for
sports bras I don't think I asked for
any new shoes I think I just asked for
like workout clothes and like random
items like I asked for like a champion
hoodie urban outfitter it's just like
little things like that but what are
some things that you guys are asking for
for Christmas like what's the number one
thing you guys want for Christmas it's
always interesting to see what everyone
else likes and what they're asking for
because I feel like everyone's like so
different and you know when you see what
other people want you're like oh yeah I
need that too so maybe I'll get some
ideas of like things to buy for myself
my foundation is all on my hairline
right now I'm just really bothering me
so what I'm gonna just wrap my hair up
into a little no I understand that look
bald now but you gotta do what you gotta
do I keep getting foundation all up in
my hair and it's
I'm going on with the naked skin Urban
Decay weightless concealer I just use
this lightly underneath my eyes to
brighten it up lately I've been
contouring my nose I say contouring
lightly because I actually don't know
how to contour my nose but I've been
like trying to do it and the other day
and I was like have you been contouring
your nose like she noticed that my nose
looked different so I think I'm doing
something right I don't know what it is
doing right but I just put the concealer
down the bridge of my nose and then I
contour later
when you guys go to Christmas parties
like what is your go-to outfit for
Christmas Friday I feel like I like
wearing red to Christmas parties just
because I think you know Reds festive I
think this body suit fits like perfectly
for Christmas because it's like velvet
and everyone during the holidays where
it spelled it well it's like a go-to
outfit that you guys always wear because
I know I'm like with family and friends
that I've known forever but I'm still
like I want to be cute I'm trying to
Instagram pictures in tonight so well if
you guys want to see the Christmas
parade that I'm going to it's at my
house I'm doing vlogmas so I'm vlogging
the entire thing so you guys will see we
have a gingerbread party every single
year and I vlog it and it's so much fun
so if you guys want to go over to my
blog channel and see how the party is
going and stuff like that you can I used
to bake like heavy also I'm using the
Too Faced peach perfect powder setting
powder whatever and you guys know I used
to bake like heavy like I used to take
my Laura Mercier and I used to literally
draw my face in it because I was like I
need to bake like if I don't think my
face isn't right okay I've learned that
you don't really need to bake that much
you know like it's not it's not that
cute of a look when you get really
powdery under eyes so I just used a
little bit and I literally like ooh
lightly dab it just in the places where
I want it to like set a little bit more
places where I get oily oily there
everywhere is not cute so it doesn't
really look like I baked it but there is
powder there that's just sitting and
I'll wipe it off a little bit later and
kind of just blend it in
I love young Bebe's so much
okay so just set my brows I've been
using me glossy airboy brow I love this
product it has obviously tent and it so
it is a vintage L you could use this on
its own without filling your brows in
but I like to just move it through my
brows to set them in place and to fill
in like the little bitty gaps that my
palmade doesn't fill in so normally I
would leave my baking on for a really
long time but know that I don't leave it
on I just wipe it off so J on my chin I
did it in between my brows and you know
under my eyes so I just wipe all this
away and then I use the brush to set the
rest of my face now I'm going with the
subculture palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills I really don't know what
look I want to go for today I love gold
and like red together cuz I feel like
that's so Christmassy yeah but I feel
like I do that look all the time so I
don't really know I think I'm gonna use
to take me on vacation palette by Kylie
cosmetics because I need a transition
color so I'm gonna go in with this one
right here so always my choice to color
it's kind of dark so really get some new
brushes I've been seeing all the tail
8ly on Kylie cosmetics and her expensive
$360 brushes I watched so many reviews
because I genuinely wanted to see all
right I really don't know I don't know I
don't want to speak on it because I
don't have the brushes so I don't know
if they're really good or they're really
bad I do know they're expensive
next up cuz I think I want to do a
little bit of red actually I don't think
I want to do red because I have purple
hair and I don't wanna do red eyeshadow
with the red top I feel like that's a
bit much maybe I'll just do gold eyes oh
yeah I made my mother I'm not gonna do
Brad because I do in colored eyeshadow
with purple hair it just looks so bad it
looks like very very drag that's not
look that I'm going for today like maybe
through what I had white white hair but
we're purple ear is very hard to like
not look like Ursula all the time so now
I'm gonna use the ax take me on vacation
palette and use this dark color over
here cuz I really like that one so I'm
gonna go on the outer corner
with myself I'm going back into this
subculture palette I'm going to use this
really pretty gold shade right here it's
called adorn I love this color let's get
some most views sound of this palette
it's such a pretty gold now I'm going
with this black liquid liner this one is
actually by Sigma this is called line
ace I got this a long time ago and I
never wear black lip liner but I'm gonna
do false lashes today so I really want
to have a good eye liner line so they
can match with my real lashes actually
you look like a bald monkey right now my
hair like this I apologize that you guys
have watched the whole video and this is
what I look like I've been using a new
mascara lately this one is by sila it's
the huge extreme lash mascara I love
this the bristle bristle Brussels
Brussels sprouts look how much better
these lashes look than these amazing so
now I'm going with my bronzer this is
the Too Faced sweetiepie bronzer it has
like blush and all that in it but I love
this especially because I'm not super
super tan right now so I can't use the
becca one that I normally use I always
have questions on what this brush is
this is a Sephora Pro contour brush then
number 79 I got this forever ago and
ever since I got it I've been carving
with it since and I love the way it
works this is my favorite Justin Beiber
Christmas song and no one cares about it
like I do so if you guys do please let
me know
the next step I'm going to do blush so
I'm using this two-faced blush I have a
lot of toothpaste this is in the shade
spiced peach absolutely love this blush
it's so perfect um but I'm gonna show
you a trick that I've been doing with my
blush lately that I have discovered and
I'm not the person skipper I'm very
probably late on trends but I absolutely
love the way it makes my skin look so
I'm gonna show you guys this is the new
Becca cosmetics ski glow face palette
and I love this so when I first opened
it up the shades are beautiful like as
you can see but a lot of the shades I
was like only two of them I really used
to highlight so I don't know what to do
with the rest this one I use with my
bronzer sometimes when I'm darker not
today and then these two I use as a
highlighter but this one right here is
like coppery and super deep and I
originally wanted to use it as just my
blush in general but then I realized if
you just put it on top of your blush
really really lightly your cheeks have
this really pretty glow I'm just gonna
show you guys so I'm taking my contour
brush because I like that it's like
points it for my cheek and I literally
lightly do it
tap it off and you can't really see on
camera but when you put it on the apples
of your cheeks it's still a blush color
but it has a highlight in it so it looks
so pretty on the skin I'm just I'm
obsessed with it and I've been doing
this every single day it's a lot more
noticeable in person than it is on
camera but I'm telling you guys it makes
you look so glowy and then next for my
highlighter I use these two and this
brush actually I've been using all like
Smashbox brushes I love Smashbox brushes
but I'm just using these two
highlighters mixed together and they're
so pretty guys as I have a strapless top
I'm also gonna like poke my collarbones
out and put just a little on each
collarbone just because I want them to
look a little more
so flat also I know it looks like my
chest is so much lighter than my face my
chest always just that with my face also
it's always good to do some on the
shoulders
I love highlighting like everywhere on
my body it's honestly like unhealthy but
it looks so much better I feel like and
then because I told you guys I'm
contouring my nose I really I don't know
what I'm doing I just like to take the
bronzer and I take this little tiny
brushes from here cosmetics I got it
like three years ago and I literally
just go down the side of my nose I'm not
like a hardcore nose contour person I
just like to make my nose up here just a
tiny bit smaller so you guys might not
see a difference but I know I see a
difference so I like to just browser
down the side of my nose and a lot of
highlighter in the center so it looks
slimmer for lips today I'm using a new
lip liner you guys have probably never
heard of it before I have never used it
ever in my life is spice by Mac it's
brand new oh yeah and then I'm going in
with this Smashbox lip color this is in
the shade always on I love this I just
got a bunch of these in from Smashbox
and they're so good I love the formula
of these I'm gonna apply the ardell demi
whispies I love these and I need my lash
it's just a tiny bit bigger tonight for
like pictures if I could hire someone to
just come to my house and apply my false
lashes I would that is how terrible I am
and applying them it honestly makes me
so mad that after all these years I
still don't know how to apply them
so this is the final Christmas party

Christmas fire that I'm going to I'm
