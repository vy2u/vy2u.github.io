be a haul and I haven't filmed the hall
in so long I know this video was super
late I've just been like slacking on
videos and stuff um but I have been like
saving all of this stuff for you guys I
have been just like racking up clothes
and my excuse is that I'm gonna fill the
hall of it but really I just have a lot
of this stuff a lot of things I did buy
when I was in California so I have my
California blog so you guys want to
check those out let's just get into it
so the first thing I got is this la hat
and I actually bought this when I was in
Louisiana which is weird but I felt when
I was in Louisiana and no I don't even
care about baseball but I like this hot
and like it's cute right well I'm gonna
tell myself it's cute because I'm gonna
wear it I think I'm gonna be into hats
this summer just because I went to Urban
Outfitters when I was in California and
I bought this really cute bra less so I
have this it's just like this and some
halter brother and I bought it in white
to wear under tank tops and then I was
like oh my god what if I'm wearing a
white shirt I don't want to wear a white
bra at whit white shirt and then there
was a Canadian black and I was like no
I'm gonna get orange maroonish and be
different so I bought this it's really
really cute and they're so comfortable
guys like also something that free
people but I think they're a little more
expensive at Urban Outfitters there are
the best things next thing about other
pedometers it's this little shirt and it
just has like a white collar and it says
snappy little number on it I really I
don't know I just thought it was really
cute and it would just look cute like
old casual and stuff I just want more
casual t-shirt so I've just been looking
for stuff like this and this was on sale
I think so yeah next I would to breaki
Melville of course the first thing I
bought it is this basic black tank top
and it's just really cute I just need
a nice black cake top it's stretchy it's
so soft obviously never stop different
email bells their clothes are so soft
but it's just really casual and I'm
gonna be able to throw it off with like
a bunch of tank tops it's possibly the
Gurlitt that I bought just cuz that's
really cute
next I bought this crop top and it just
has like a little it just has like palm
trees on it and then like a little hotel
in the corner it's really you
and then I bought this is what a lot of
you guys were asking you or it's round
because I guess it doesn't look like it
would be sold at Brittany level but it's
a cropped sweater and it's maybe why I
wrote it looks so big it's just a really
cute crop sweater and it has little
lines on the side which I thought was
really cool
lastly I bought this gray halter top
from brandy melville I wore this
actually in my are a Grande get ready
with me they'll let you guys are asking
words from so I wore this oh and I wore
it with the orange Ebola thing halter
tops are like something for summer like
I know I'm gonna be wearing halter tops
all summer so so all that stuff I bought
when I was in California and then I came
back home and I was like you need more
clothes that's what I do so I went on
brand new mobile comm and I bought more
clothes with Brittany Bobo the first
thing I bought from Brady mama is this
shirt and it just says New York on it
and then I'm sold
you think and it is so stretchy and long
and like it is so soft I'm going to
sleep in every night but I actually wore
this to a party the other day and it is
so long that I weren't as a t-shirt
dress I wore like little shorts
underneath it but you can wear it with
like booties and like it's literally a
t-shirt I show you guys a picture here
but it was so comfortable like I've
never been more cut 2 in my life and I
was wearing it before I was going to bed
and then I was like I could
we're in the Zaza teacher dress so it
was just really versatile next thing I
bought from brandy melville is another
halter top and this one is just so
pretty it is also great but it's like
grey and why it looks like it's kind of
tie-dyed and I just thought this would
look really good when I'm extra tan in
the summer just because I don't know if
it's me my skin during the summer I just
thought this was so cute and I like
halter tops okay the last thing that I
bought from brandy melville is
completely a joke
but I just thought it was so funny that
I like had to buy it um if you haven't
heard this song but I bought this shirt
to sleep in and since it break in soda I
got baking so like the sign right here
just so you can know like what I'm
talking about this is just asleep and by
the way not public where it was just
funny that is all for brandy melville
and nos things that I bought are from
Urban Outfitters and I ordered these
online which is just a no-no you'll go
see so I bought three pair of shorts and
just because I'm like afraid of sizing
on maybe not bitters I just feel like
some of their stuff comes way too small
so I got a size up in shorts and that
was the worst decision these shorts I'm
so big um but I bought these white
shorts they're just like what are they
beeping
I don't really know I just bought them I
just really wanted white shorts and so I
bought these and they're just way too
big so I'm going to return them and get
a size smaller
but they're really cute and I also did
the same thing with a gene pair of them
so neither one of these shorts fit me
but they're so cute and then they're
just like I don't know they're just they
just look so cute and I really wanted to
wear that these are Levi's actually um
but I'm just
phosphors birthday girl from Urban
Outfitters aren't these and they are so
cute guys I've been wanting a pair of
shorts like this that are just like this
material I'd have like a little design
on them cuz I only wear jean shorts but
these are so cute guys I can't wait to
wear them with like just a white crop
top or like a white light blues shirt
I'm so excited they're so soft okay so I
accidentally forgot to show you guys
this it was like under all the clothes
but I bought this online at Friday Malvo
and it is just this long it's like down
to like the mid thigh you can't really
even see but it literally looks like a
raincoat and has this long zipper down
the middle I can't even sit because I
have like 25 buttons but it's just
really really cute and I have one like
this in army green and it's kind of more
crop but this one I just saw in our
sleep through the winter night I'm gonna
want to wear that every single day so I
bought it and it's just really really
cute don't judge me I know I bought
everything like writing jacket it's free
so it's not as all I have bought
recently I really just need to restrain
myself it might not seem like a lot to
you but a lot of stuff to me and so I
really need to restrain myself and not
go find more things but I hope you guys
like this haul I have it set up on a
long time so if you guys like these
walls let me know in the comments below
and I'll make sure to like save my stuff
later on like during months and then do
another collective haul like that but
yeah that's basically it I hope you guys
