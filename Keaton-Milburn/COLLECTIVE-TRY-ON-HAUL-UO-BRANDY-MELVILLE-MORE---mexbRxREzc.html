literally always start off with this
rubber band on my hand what's up guys
today's video is going to be a try on
haul so this is just a bunch of stuff
that I have bought recently or like
received that some things are like for
my birthday whatever but this is just a
bunch of stuff that I bought and I'm
gonna show it to you but I'm also going
to be trying it on so you'll see that in
a minute
I've never done a try on haul like for
this channel or anything so I mean I've
watched them but I've never done one
before so I hope you guys like this if
you guys like this like haul like this
style like a try on haul things and just
give this video a thumbs up and let me
know in the comments below but let's
just get into the clothes also I'm going
to be making an announcement
at the end of this video so stay tuned
for that so the first thing that I have
I'm so obsessed with and it is this and
it is just like a little crop top it's
tied in the back super super cute I love
this and with this I really wanted to
wear like a big skirt that I also have
from Urban Outfitters the top is from
Urban Outfitters so I'm probably gonna
be wearing this a - ACL which is a music
festival it is October 3rd through the
5th so if yours go to ACL I will be
there weekend 1 so like come say hi but
I'm gonna be wearing it this crop top
for one of the days
so the second item is and we don't draw
and I'm not gonna be trying this on I'm
just gonna show you guys here cuz that's
awkward but this is a probably I got
little lemon it's just a little sports
bra and it has these little white lines
on it but when I bought it I thought it
was just a sports bra but it's actually
a like sweat to swim so this is actually
a swimsuit top and you can like unzip it
and stuff it's really really cute and
like I love it
so actually wore this like for my
birthday moving to the beach and like I
swam in it
well I also got this sports bra from
Lululemon as well the back is just like
this it's a nice army green I love army
green this has little leaves and stuff
like that I don't know I thought it was
really cute and I don't have a lot of
colorful or like patterned sports bras
so I figured I needed one next thing
that I got are these Lululemon leggings
and I love these so again I got army
leggings are just like this on the top
and then they have like a little black
line on the bottom which I love so
comfortable and I just needed them to
wear like to school and just like out
and about next I have this top and this
is just a black like knitted almost like
tank top and I'm also bring this to ACL
I really really love this I can't wait
to work with like shorts and just like a
bunch of jewelry the feeling of it is
super super loose which is why I picked
it out because I'm gonna be really hot
so I wanted something that was loose and
like why I probably wear a bra light and
stuff underneath it but yeah I really
really love this the next thing I bought
in California so Holly hates this shirt
just FYI but it's just like a giant
t-shirt but it's from wild Fox so it's
really really soft like it's like if
you've seen like wild Fox like sweaters
and stuff like it feels like that so I
love like sleeping in it but it just
says more on it and I thought it would
be cute for like Valentine's Day or
something I don't know I'm really lame
and I plan my outfits out like five
years in advance so this top I'm super
obsessed with like I spent a stupid
amount of money on this top but I just
really really thought I needed it I
really really loved the texture and like
the fabric of this it's super like
structured even though it doesn't look
very structured I like dressing stuff up
like this like I like wearing heels and
jeans and stuff like that with it so the
next thing is from Urban Outfitters and
it is just a basic little black dress
it's open kind of in the back and it's
just flowy my mom might pick this up for
me just cuz she thought I would like it
and it's just really cute it's almost
like the exact brandy melville dresses
that they sell but I really like this
work just because like it looks more
like rugged if that makes any sense
next thing is also from Urban Outfitters
it is this like light it's almost it
looks from a room on camera but it's
like kind of like it's just like a burnt
kind of maroon but the back is open
which I really really love so I also
plan on wearing this to ACL and I want
to put like a bunch of flash tattoos
like down
back so cuz it's like open so I love
this was really really cute for that and
again it's opening the bag so that it's
really breezy for when I'm outside in
the heat so the last things are from
brandy melville so the first talk I had
to buy it is this little tank top it's
cropped it has these little really like
detailing on the side and I absolutely
love it it's super light I might be
wearing this a CL if the other top
doesn't work but I really really love
this and I saw it on their Instagram and
I do not it just doesn't look like a
shirt that brandy melville would really
make like it's just like I don't know
it's just so different I really love it
so I got that I also picked up their
halter top and this is just like a basic
tan halter top these fit me really
really good I have it in black and I
love the way it fits me and then the tan
just like really went well with like my
hair color in my eyes so I just figured
I would get this one and I want to buy
like a bunch more colors but it just
depends it's getting cold this is also
another shirt that I did not like Saint
came from brandy melville I keep hitting
myself in the eyeball with this um but
this is just another shirt it didn't
look like it came from brandy melville
and it's just like a cute little pattern
open on the side right here the back is
just like the same as the front and I
just really liked this it's just like a
nice basic - you can put on with jeans
or you can like dress it up a lot so I
love this the next two shirts are
actually is the same but this one is in
pink and it's almost like tie-dye and I
am obsessed with these shirts I got it
in the pink and I also got it in maroon
and it's just like a low V in the front
and then it's just open in the back and
I just really love the way these fit
like my body like I just feel like they
flatter me more than any other like tank
top some tank tops are just like I don't
know they're too tight but this one
isn't too tight or too loose it's just
like perfect and I love wearing it with
like high-waisted jeans just because it
is cropped and I don't want to show that
much of my stomach
um but yeah so I love those now for my
announcement so it's not like that must
like a big announcement but I wanted to
let you guys know that I will be at
