just put all my chokers in there because
I don't know I like having them right
there um I have my purse and then I have
a little cork board it's really not done
it looks really ratty right now but I'm
going to add so many more pictures to it
I'm hoping I think it's really cute
though so far and then I
these flowers right here and then I have
this Stein which i think is so cute and
it says positive vibes only which is
super like basic and adoring but like
but I think it's cute so I put it there
I don't know if it's out of like clay
bulbs or something right now you can
barely see that it's even on so whatever
okay all these lights that are around my
window are from Urban Outfitters and
I'll show you guys actually the exact
ones that they are are these if you guys
were wondering they are the only intern
lights so that's that twelve feet long
winter nights and those are what go
around my window get my view I think
it's so pretty at night it's the
prettiest view in the whole world like
I'm obsessed I have a fan from Target
and then this is this side of my room so
this is what this side looks like my
bedspread is from Urban Outfitters and I
think it is so amazing I love flowers
guys and yellows my favorite colors so
let's have some yellow in here I just
have these this is all from Urban
Outfitters my sheets and everything but
my pillows right here are actually from
Ikea like the coverings and stuff are
all from Ikea there's my little bear and
then I have my favorite bible verse
above my bed and it's first day of
sixteen seven people look at the outward
appearance but God looks at the heart so
I love that and I keep it right there
and then this little decor is from Urban
Outfitters as well and then if you guys
are wondering about this this is from
the loom
I got it in Athens Greece when I went so
that's that I just like how it I don't
know I just thought it looked cute so I
leave it on the end of my bed underneath
my bed I have like a bunch of crap it's
really not cute like at all but how
about my shoes over here those bins are
from Ikea this is just a bunch of crap
that you guys like don't you see oh this
is what I keep on my bathing suit so you
guys are wondering beot that's that my
trashcan is from Target there we go over
here I have my mirror so hello my mirror
is from I believe it's from Ikea I can't
and then this is my closet but I covered
it up with a curtain so you don't have
to see this because like this isn't very
cute it's super messy not organized so I
covered it up so that everything kind of
blends so yeah this is my room this is
what it looks like I love it it's so
comfy so yeah this is my dorm I really
like it I think it's super comfortable I
wanted to feel as comfortable as
possible in a place that I really don't
know anyone and that I've never been
stuff so I feel super super comfortable
in this and I think that if you guys are
going to if you guys are seniors and
you're thinking about you know like
being in a dorm and all that kind of
stuff where you guys are already a
freshman in college I would really
suggest putting as much of you into your
room as possible because this is where
you're going to be studying and like
you're just going to want to come home
from a long day of like school and just
being out and stuff and be somewhere
that's so comfortable and I think that
is the best thing for me I feel so
comfortable here and I think that it
would be so much worse if I didn't put
so much time into like decorating it and
stuff so I highly suggest even if you've
already moved in just getting a few
pictures to hang on the wall or like
your favorite scripture something that
makes you feel comfortable stuff like
that I would highly suggest because it
has made all the difference it's made
moving here so much easier so yeah if
you guys are wondering where any of the
stuff is from I'm going to link it down
below I promise you I will link it down
below I know I always say that in videos
but I promise I will link like the IKEA
shelves the impressions vanity the decor
if they're out of them online then
that's the only reason they wouldn't be
length is if they're sold out but other
than that I'll link everything for you
guys so I hope you guys like this video
I will soon be putting up other videos
other than room tours and stuff like
that but yeah so I hope you guys like
this video and I'll see you guys next
week right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
