obviously going to be my college dorm
tour so I'm so so excited to be filming

just moved back to Arizona I go to
Arizona State University and I am an
alpha fee so I actually live in my
sorority dorms so it's really really
exciting to show you guys where I'm
living and a lot of my stuff is actually
the same from last year but a lot of you
guys wanted ideas if you guys have like
a bigger room and things like that so
I'm gonna be showing you guys my dorm
just because you guys have been tweeting
me so much and asking to see it all so
before I get into it I'm so so sorry
that this video has taken so long I've
been at sorority recruitment from nine
to five for like the past week it's
literally been the longest week of my
life which is why my voice sounds like
it's kind of going away but anyway I
think there's so much for watching also
give this video a big thumbs up if you
guys want to see more videos like this
and follow me on all my social media and
let's get into the video so what this is
what it looks like
right when you guys walk into my room so
the first thing that I'm gonna show you
guys is this closet so when you walk in
I have this closet on the left and it's
all color-coded so it's like red yellow
green blue all that kind of stuff all my
blocks and whites are like the most and
then I have all my nice dresses up here
on the top that is where I have all my
mugs for my coffee I have an extra
tapestry and the clothes right there
actually for a back to school haul that
I'm gonna be filming but I wanted to
keep the new clothes separate from these
clothes so I don't mix them up so I know
what to film so that is that up there
