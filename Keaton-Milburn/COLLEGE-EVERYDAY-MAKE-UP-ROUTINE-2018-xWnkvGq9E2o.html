but you gotta be there for me too how
cute was my intro it was so cute right
it's so cute I felt like it was 2018 I
need start doing some things that are a
little bit more professional like like
have an intro and an outro like I used
to do that all the time but then I just
felt like it was like cheesy so I
stopped doing it I feel like I really
wanted to intro it back and I really
wanted the outro back so like yeah it's
back anyways what's up guys today's
video is going to be on this makeup look
right here I'm not really sure what I'm
titling this field
it's my college makeup routine my
current makeup routine it's literally
both I do this makeup every single day
the most simple makeup but I absolutely
love it if you guys are new here and
this is your first time on my channel if
you guys like this video don't forget to
and subscribe and hit the notification
ball below so you guys know what am i
posting and you guys have been long
again Instagram and Twitter so so much
recently I mean so much to me that you
guys are like interested in what I'm
doing besides just on my main channel
without me talking anymore let's just
get into the video okay this is my first
time like using my ring light in my dorm
so I haven't really figured out where I
want to film these types of videos I
didn't like where I was filming my old
one it's just bear with me if the
Lighting's weird and if just this
background looks really awkward because
I don't know what I'm doing yet for
years on YouTube and I still don't know
how to do it so the first product I'm
going to use this the Smashbox photo
finish primer this is correcting adjust
primer this is the green one because I
have been getting like little bitty
breakouts and stuff and they're red and
this cancels out the redness and I'm
just really like with feels my voice
sounds like this because I'm obviously
like dying I'm like sick or something I
don't really know I think it's just
allergies I hope
yeah like I could just die I miss
filming so so much and I haven't done
like just like a sit down video it's so
long so I'm so happy to be like doing
this the next thing I'm going to use is
the glam glow mega illuminating
moisturizer and this is in Sun glow
there's three different shades but Sun
glows my favorite because it's the
darkest and you know me I like to look
like a vulva all year round so I just
adopt this everywhere and rub it and
it's just glittery and look moisturizing
and it smells like pina coladas it's the
best
so the next thing I've been doing a lot
that I used to not ever do but like now
I'm into it so this is the infallible
proclo concealer by L'Oreal and this is
in the shade what shade is this shade
fifty it's actually pretty dark it's not
really like my skin color at all but I
like to put this on underneath my
foundation and I just cover all my
pimples with it and then I blend it out
and I feel like this really really helps
to conceal my pimples more than just
like doing the foundation over I never
used to conceal my pimples and also it's
really good to use a concealer that's
not like way lighter than your skin like
I would never conceal my foot pulse with
that concealer I dream my eyes because
it was just brighten the pimples not
conceal them so I'm doing it like more
of a orangie also I needed this
mirror here now I'm taking this our
brush from Tarte I got this a long time
ago has two different pans but I use
this end and I just use it to like blend
out the concealer it's all gonna be
covered up anyway but just so it's not
so like harsh just to blend it out so I
decide to ruin my entire life by buying
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation this is in the shade 6
it's definitely only the shade that I
would use if I just break in which
currently as you could tell and do have
a spray tan so I'm gonna be using this
today it is so expensive but it is for a
right reason guys like I was so
skeptical
English it was words I was so skeptical
buying it because I was just like there
is no way I'm about to spend
$68 on the foundation but I did it and
now I'm screwed because there's
literally no other foundation I want to
use right now and I'm really getting
back into like my more glowy foundations
which you guys know I used to today's
not one like forever so I was like
really into Matt which I still am but
like I would just really think like I
know I was kind of like am ia like
beginning of 2018 because normally I
would have posted like three videos by
now most likely you guys follow my blog
channel you guys know I was very much
just like should I take a little break
and kind of like getting my life
together I've been vlogging so much more
I'm gonna be vlogging today as well so
yeah I feel like you guys should go
follow my vlog channel if you guys want
to see what I'm doing because it is
really hard to post main channel videos
just when I'm in college because it's
like so much less time to do things but
it's so much easier to vlog and I feel
like you guys really like seeing like
that side of my life like you guys like
seeing like my week in my life and that
kind of things so if you guys like that
then you guys should definitely go check
out my vlog channel because that is more
interesting I feel like the shot up for
my lighting is going to look like I'd
like a really dark neck and I really
like face but I promise I'm cute person
music Nina kids get Urban Decay
concealer this isn't a shame fairy buzz
no I use just every single time I don't
really use as much as I used to use I
used to use a lot of this like I did
like raccoon eyes but now I don't know I
just do like here what was that a sneeze
I don't know like there's so much like
going on you guys lives that I like just
don't know about like what's good guys
just comment below are you guys
traveling anywhere in 2018 where do you
guys like New Year's resolutions like
just love you know I'm trying you know
touch up on things I just I know it
hasn't been that long but I just feels
like it has mixed up I'm gonna bake my
face a little bit and using the peach
perfect powder by Too Faced and I'm just
gonna set my under eyes a little bit
oh that's all just got my mouth it
tastes so good
literally tastes so good I could just
like eat this entire container like no
joke I'm going to like knock off ice
cream easier today like you know the ice
cream in LA that everyone goes to and
it's like impossible to get into this
like I tried to go and like they were
sold out whatever yeah there's a good
knock off one here in Arizona and I'm
going to it so you guys are gonna see my
knockoff pics on my Instagram later on
today follow me you guys have been
following me a lot and term lightly I
really appreciate it it really makes
like my heart very happy because it
means that you guys actually like me
which you know sometimes you might not
have Spotify does a playlist at the end
of the year of all your top played songs
like of that year so I'm gonna play my
top hundred songs of 2017 or I don't
know if it's a hundred is it 100 it
might be I don't know about the free top
songs like 2017 because
do my eyes shut up right after my
eyebrows but I don't do that anymore
because it's 2018 and I'm a new woman
I'm telling you right now I am well at
this point I do my bronzer and I like
contouring stuff so I'm using the
sweetie pie to face nation to face
bronzer and then I'm also using the
Smashbox what is this called again it's
the baked starburst it's this little
thing that I just mix all together
dad because I'm Carly if I about and
contour my nose bronzer on this little
tiny brush and I literally just go on
the other side to my nose and you guys
might not see a difference if you guys
might not actually care about this step
in my face routine you guys might be
like Keaton you literally look the exact
same Dada Dada
you know what I don't feel like I do and
a literal male man literally notice my
nose contour he was a cured nose looks
different like it looks like a different
nose and I was like bro I started nose
contouring
isn't that amazing like I was like well
because that means I'm doing something
right like that means I kind of know
what I'm doing feel like it looks really
dark right you can't rob promise it's
not that contoured in real life okay so
because Holly loves me so much and she's
the best ever she bought me this morphe
palette and it's the brush brush it's a
blush palette like look it is so
beautiful it's the one I think
Jacqueline hullick said she likes or
whatever it's by Morpheus 9 and I don't
know that's what it says on the back of
it but I am going to be using this today
the first day that I used it I was such
oh yes let me get some of this I
literally looked like a clown it was so
ugly so this is very very pigmented so
like I'm gonna show you how much I'm
gonna put it on my brush I'm gonna go in
with this one and I'm like literally
going like that and I'm topping it off
I'm also not a brush girl like I'm
really like I don't like blush like it's
just not mine so I'm like very hesitant
to like ever I feel like this is very
natural also I'm not really sure what I
tide out this video if I kinda get like
my current makeup or two because this is
my current makeup routine or if I titled
it my college makeup routine because
this is literally what I wear every
single day just
yes I wear a full face of makeup every
single day and I wear a full face with
makeup to every single my classes and
you want to know why because I feel like
it on top of my blush even though I just
said amount of blush girl I'm gonna do
what I always do I'm gonna take these
Becca what is this palette called
ski glow face palette I'm going to use
this coppery shade right here and I'm
gonna throw it on top of my cheeks that
should give it like a little bit more
shimmer I think this looks really pretty
and like if I don't put this on my
cheeks before I leave the house I can
tell that I didn't do it that day and I
just feel like this really helps my skin
look like so glowy I feel like I'm just
like a really happy person right now so
maybe that's why I'm like glowing from
within
now I'm gonna go in with some
highlighter this is the Becca cosmetics
vanilla quartz highlighter this is my
current favorite highlighter oh my god
it is so pretty I like got out of the
packaging and I was like okay well they
send me another highlighter like shocker
back to cosmetics and highlighter I used
it and I was like holy crap I love this
color I just feel like it looks so good
like oh my god you've got to be joking
me okay guys so for eyeshadow I'm going
to do like the most simple eyeshadow
look ever because I do this every single
day before school and I'm not trying to
be like all crazy so I just use do you
take me on vacation palette by Kylie
cosmetics and then literally only use
two shades from it and put them all over
my eyes and that's about it
so the first one I'm taking is that
right there and I'm setting my eyelid
all I'm going to be doing is taking this
light brown shade right here and I
literally put it all over my crease it
was a big part of my 27
because I want to darken it just a
little bit more I'm gonna take this like
darker brown shade and I'm just gonna
put this really close to the close close
to the center of my lash line right here
and I'm just gonna like make my whole
lid a little bit darker so that it's
kind of like a dark lid going into it
why I don't know if that really makes
sense but you can see with your eyes
what I'm doing I really feel like my
skin looks so much more clear and I know
that might just be me like trying to
like like myself more but I really feel
like it's more clear I start taking how
many trician vitamins I take three
different types I think yeah three
different types of vitamins once for my
hair nails and skin and then I have
another one for my skin and then I have
one for like energy throughout the day
because I get really tired throughout
the day I don't know why I'm just always
exhausted so I was like I need to stop
taking like three naps per day and I
need to take my vitamins so that's what
I've been doing so I feel like that's
why some of my skin has been clearing up
and I've just been using so much
treatment on my skin you guys must give
care routine soon let me know because I
might be doing that because I feel like
my skin's really been clearing up maybe
it's just this foundation that's really
making me like feel myself anyway I'm
gonna be doing my lips down using this
glam glow what lip chapstick on because
I always put a little bit I have
literally cringe so hard when I see
people applying their lip liner or their
liquid lipsticks over like they're dry
crusted lip I'm like that's gonna cake
and it's gonna crack like I always put
chapstick on before maybe I'm just weird
and maybe I don't know not everyone does
that but that's how I feel I'm going
back in with an old lip combo that I use
all the time this is the colourpop lip
liner
951 I believe she believes not an
aneurysm but because on this thought
earlier about how like I wear a full
face of makeup to class and like I wear
a full face of makeup every day I hate
that people get like mad if you're
wearing a full face of makeup all the
time like yes sometimes I don't wear
makeup but like most of the time I want
to wear makeup because one that's just
how I start my day like I literally wake
up and do my makeup there's just like a
natural part of my routine so like I
hate me bar like you're wearing makeup
to class you're wearing makeup here like
yeah and like that's how I used to be in
high school too like I used to wear
makeup all the time makes our makeup
like every single day and everyone would
be like oh my god you get ready for
school like as if like it was bad to
care what I looked like I don't really
understand that concept so yeah I feel
like some people are gonna be like wow I
go so ratchet to class that's okay if
you go ratchet to class - I do it
sometimes - but me personally I love
waking up and doing my makeup like I
take like two hours on it before class
like I just think it's so fun and I feel
like it's just like weeks my Brina you
know what I'm saying second exercise
also I got my third you're saying in my
ear in a month I'm going back to get my
fourth I'm very very excited because I
want all my ears pierced for Coachella
which I am going to as well if you guys
aren't following my blog channel you
guys should because you guys would know
all this by now also my hair is just wow
for studying the face I'm going in with
the new color pop and burn crystal
setting spray this smells so good it's
my new favorite setting spray and I'm
pretty sure this is the collection that
they have with Sephora it smells so good
but you need to hold this spray like far
far away like two arm's length away
because it's like on your face so yeah
I'm just going to use this
all righty guys so that's it for this
