o'clock in the morning okay a little bit
past because I snoozed like three times
but you guys really really liked my
college night routine and so I decided
to film a college morning routine for
you guys in the same type of way I
filmed the college event routine like
blog style like this I'll link it down
below if you guys haven't seen it yet
and you guys seem to really really like
that so I figured I would do a college
morning routine for you guys
so yeah it's currently 7 o'clock and I'm
so tired I went to better like to last
night and I woke up at 7 every morning
and I have classes at I have a class
today at 914 it's not on the class but I
like spit 7 because I need to like wake
up and get my day started I'm also about
to help in the shower make some coffee
and everything so yeah so here is my
cute little dorm shower
I know it's just adorable so I am
starting off using my head and shoulders
clinical solutions dandruff shampoos it
has up to a 7 day protection and I love
this stuff guys know I've talked about
some other videos I do struggle with
dandruff especially living in Arizona
where I have very dry skin and a very
dry scalp it does not help but I have
had dandruff for like the longest but
I'm so happy to be working with head and
shoulders because it just really really
helped me so I am just rubbing that in
eyes I would regular with any shampoo
and then rinsing it out so normally I'll
just wash my body and shave um that's
that and then I will hop out of the
shower and be done so I just got a
shower I put the sweat rag on I know I
slept in it I promise it's not gross I
just like it cause it's warm okay anyway
so I showed you guys in my last field
you take you shower or whatever but if
you like when I take showers in the
morning it wakes my body because I'm so
exhausted wipes women kept like I'm so
exhausted and I just like cannot
function like I don't know in the
morning I'm just like so tired and I'd
be like if I just get up and I hop right
in the shower I'm awake and then I can
do whatever I need for the rest of the
day so with that being said so I know I
kind of twist about my dandruff before
and whatever but
it is something that I have always had
always had dangerous so being able to
work with head and shoulders it's like
amazing it's actually really doing
something for me like it's really
actually helping me and so I've been
using the head and shoulders clinical
solutions dangerous treatment is the
leap on dandruff treatment and it
actually works for over 24 hours for up
to 24 hours and actually I used to see
yesterday I used it when my hair was dry
you can use it when your hair is dry or
what just putting a light refer when I
used to when I was dry I felt like it
almost volumize manner which is really
weird but whatever you do you head and
shoulders all know what you put in as
magical stuff but I'm put in my hair so
basically I will just move kind of like
on problem areas I guess and I spray
directly on the scalp and then I massage
it and I just move it on in there and
this is really going to help calm the
itching and because it's leave on you
can just leave it in all day and I feel
like it's working so throughout the day
you're not it's here you're not being
bothered by your scalp like a nozzle no
wonder those of this that I never see
people talk about this so you know what
that's what we're gonna do I believe you
can find this in the shampoo at
Walgreens so I won't also link
everything down below if you guys are
interested but I figured I would include
this because this is my I'm not itching
by the way I'm putting this massage in
my head I felt like I would include this
because I obviously and making these
worn routines and night routines a
little bit more personal with you guys
and so I feel like this is a little bit
more personal to me be like oh I love
you wash my hair with Head &amp;amp; Shoulders
like I actually do so I'm including this
next up every morning and this is
normally just because I am hungry I will
take my vitamins every single morning
take your vitamins I can't get out of it
but take your vitamins because they
don't taste the best but that's how you
know that they work because when they
don't ease the greatest so guys will
number wanted to starting off any
morning is make your bed never leave
your room with your bed unmade I promise
you will come back so upset because your
room in the mess make your bed every
morning
which is what I'm going to do my bed is
made
all done have some clothes on the end
but it looks so much better once it's
made I promised guys make your bed every
morning and you'll feel so much better
normally after I shower

time to get ready so it's eight o'clock
