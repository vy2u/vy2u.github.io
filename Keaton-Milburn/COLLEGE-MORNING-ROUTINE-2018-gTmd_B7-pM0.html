but you gotta be there for me too good
morning lighting was super bad over
there but obviously I just woke up
because if I didn't just wake up and
wouldn't look like this I feel like a
lot of boring routines used to be like
oh my gosh here's my morning routine and
they would really like film it out like
5 p.m. and the lighting was good and
they have like a little bit of concealer
on and like makeup like yeah
yeah no I literally just woke up it is
7:30 2:00 in the morning so when I wake
up I sound like this I sound like a boy
and I have pimples in that's life
today's video is going to make college a
morning routine you guys have requested
this video so I'm super excited to film
it for you guys if you guys are new to
my channel don't forget to subscribe and
hit that notification bus so you guys
know when I'm posting and follow me on
Instagram and Twitter you know all the
stuff you know you just go do it after
this video because you need to watch the
video first
so actually don't have cause until 10:30
but I have to go pick up my bacon nut at
9:45 ish and obviously I want to do my
makeup just because I hate like a
ratchet go on a class you guys already
know if you guys watched my college
makeup routine which you guys should if
you haven't what are you doing with your
life but have you watched it you guys
know I do makeup every morning um so
with that being said I'm going to get
ready
so if you guys did watch my college
everyday makeup routine and whatnot you
guys know I've been really working on my
skin and this is like the first pimple I
have got and that's been like red and
super annoying everything else is like
under the skin and like slowly going
away this is the first one and it's
because I messed with it I shouldn't
have done that but I just was getting so
impatient I found that not only washing
your face at night which is what I've
always said if I wash my face that no I
don't like you know used to cleanser and
moisturizer and all that but especially
watching your face in the morning still
helps I think I just never really did
that because I just thought like I'll
already washed it like how could I have
gone dirty in the morning but you would
be very surprised as to what happens on
your face in your sleep and just like
what is still there from not washing it
off this video is in collaboration with
Neutrogena so thank you so much -
Neutrogena for sponsoring this video and
I absolutely love them you guys know
because I've worked with them before so
thank you guys so much them I'm going to
show you guys what products I use in the
morning from them to help keep my face
clean and so the first thing I'm going
in with is the acne proofing gel
cleanser this clears breakouts and helps
defend against new ones to make the skin
more acne resistant so I've been using
this because obviously I've been trying
to cure my acne and it really is going
away like I promise it is so I'm gonna
wash my face with this first
this smells so good too another thing
about washing your face and the morning
and like having to put water in your
face is that if you're so tired and
obviously really really wakes you up so
I've gone let the water wash my face in
the morning the warm just like okay
let's get ready for the day
I also really love that the watch is
oil-free it makes my skin feel really
good and doesn't leave it feeling like
grimy or anything it just feels really
really good
now I don't know if you guys can see
this my camera know if it shows up but I
do wash my face every night to get my
makeup off but sometimes it's just that
like when I wash my face in the morning
with this it kind of shows that there's
still a little bit of makeup like I'll
have a little bit of mascara underneath
my eyes or I'll just have like a little
bit of makeup and like my hair line
where I don't wash as good so because of
that I'm gonna go on with the Neutrogena
cleansing towelettes I love these if you
guys follow me and extreme you guys to
know I use them all the time in my
little makeup tutorials you just
absolutely love them and I feel like
they get the most of my makeup off than
any other makeup line I've ever used
they get 99.3% of your makeup off so if
that doesn't time to use them I don't
know what does I really don't have that
much makeup on my skin but I know I've
put a lot of makeup in my hairline
because you don't like to have like a
white scalp and I also blend it a lot
into my ears and down my neck so in the
mornings I like to just make sure that I
do have all of my makeup off before I
apply more because it's pretty gross
when you over may have not looked like I
had makeup on my skin but this wipe took
all of the excess off of my skin around
my hairline around my ears my jaw all of
that and no clean the last step in my
skin that I do before I like get ready
for my day and all that kind of stuff is
use the Neutrogena hydro boost
multivitamin and booster and look at
this moisturizer absolutely love the way
it looks at makes me feel like really
like scientific cool okay anyway so I
just do a few pumps of this onto my
hands because I love moisturizing my
skin you know be my dry skin and it's so
cooling and refreshing another thing I
love about Neutrogena products that I
don't leave your skin feeling oily or
greasy the makeup wipe doesn't feel oily
or greasy the cleanser has salicylic
acid in it so it doesn't make your skin
feel at all greasy it's just perfect and
same with the moisturizer so really
pissed off about this
we're gonna have to get on with our day
that's all I do for my face in the
mornings thank you guys so much again to
Gina for sponsoring this video all the
products you guys see here can be
shopped at Rite Aid so I will leave the
link to shop at Rite Aid's down below
they have a lot of super good other
Neutrogena products if you guys want to
check out what fits you best I
absolutely love these three products
though and I highly recommend them so if
you guys want to shop them I will link
the link below to shop them out right
now because I'm blind as a bat I'm going
to put my contacts in because I cannot
see anything
Oh bitch mug do we want this cute
so I've got my coffee here and then I
decided because I know I'm gonna be
hungry i heated up this think then
protein and fiber hot oatmeal this is
the honey and peanut butter one looks
really weird but it's actually really
good and it's super easy to make and I
didn't want to take my vitamins on an
empty stomach so I decided I would eat
that and then take my vitamins these are
just to help me this is like hair nails
skin whatever or pills this one is to
give me energy and this one is to
cleanse my skin again of like pimples
and toxins and like things like that
and it's now 822 so it took me like an
hour to just like get situated wash my
face and do my makeup and all that kind
of stuff so feeling very weak very alive
I just finished my coffee and my
breakfast so now I'm going to be don't
know it ok so I really was going to try
with my outfit today we're like jeans
and like a sweater or some things I
really don't feel like it so I'm wearing
a hoodie I guess everyone's always
wondering why I sleep in my extensions
because they're like clip-ins and like
they can get tangled I might get old but
I really need to brush them a little
more clean looking because sometimes I
really do go to class without brushing
my hair also another reason is that I do
my makeup every single day is that like
even when I wear outfits like this and
it's just like literally a hoodie and
leggings I look more put together than I
what if I was wearing the honey and
leggings and no makeup like I just would
look like I really don't care but when I
have makeup on it's like oh we should
get our makeup you know it's like they
don't have to see how ratchet I really
am but um yeah I know my hair looks
better because it's like nice if you
guys watched my old college morning
routines
I always said make your bed before you
leave your room to go to class or a free
leave to go anywhere because when your
beds made and your room is clean and you
come back you feel more productive you
just feel like you got everything done
so I'm gonna make my bed right now
before I leave
next thing that I do every morning is
read my devotional so this one is he
whispers your name by Cherry Hill and
absolutely loved it so I have my little
book marker on here and I just read
whatever I have for that day so yeah
I'll just be reading this and then I'll
be good to go so now I'm packing my
notebook and planner and stuff any for
the day I have my headphones I need a
pack these and I'm also probably gonna
pack some snacks and case I get hungry
anyways guys that is it for my college
boy routine I'm literally just going to
walk out the door go pick up Matt and
head to class so I hope you guys liked
