obviously going to be a college night
routine and you're probably wondering
what set it off like a vlog so basically
I wanted to give this video really
really personal with you guys and I feel
like when I set my camera on the tripod
and I show me like walking into my door
but like pretending to go to bed and
stuff like that I feel like it's kind of
awkward me personally like no escapes me
other youtuber definitely done that
before but I wanted to keep this night
routine super personal and show you guys
what like my actual night routine is
like every single day that I'm in
college like this is exactly what I do
for the most part so there are going to
be some point there's like I'm going to
shower later in stuff like that so
you'll definitely see some camera on a
tripod shot but I want to do a lot of it
box out because I just wanted to like
chill and talk to you guys and I feel
like I always put blogs up on my blog
channel but not all of you guys can
subscribe to that so you guys never see
them anyway I'm just rambling on about
why I'm doing half of this video blog
style and the other half will be kind of
like on a tripod but basically I just
finished my workout so I've been working
out every single day but my my night
routine starts out I go to the gym every
single day I went to the gym at 6:25 and
I leave at 8:30 so when I go up to 35 I
normally stay until 8:30 but my sessions
aren't normally that long if you guys
don't want to see a full workout routine
like with my trainer because I do have a
trainer and I go every single day and
I've been going every single day and I
feel like it's really going to help me
like it in shape for the summer
subscribe actually want to see a workout
routine please comment in the comments
below if you guys actually want to see
that because I really really do want to
know if you guys want to see that but
Telsey was texting me she was like oh my
god I'm having the biggest chocolate
craving so I went to McDonald's and I
got her a chocolate shake just because I
don't know she said she was craving
chocolate and so I figured out what
surprised her and get a chocolate shake
just because I am still crying myself
for going to McDonald's and not getting
chicken nuggets and not getting food
I just let my work out and I was like
you can't but I got hurt I am I brought
you a present if you said you want to
talk with yourself today eyes like oh I
was so hard to go to McDonald's and not
going to most it ok the dining hall that
connected like in my dorm is closed
because they don't want to feed me so I
guess we're going to go to sixth place I
always take fillet and I'm going to say
I thought I got because you guys have
like can you just work out you're not
supposed to do that I got fruit at that
fries and I got a grilled chicken wrap
instead of like fried chicken strips
which is what I normally get so I bought
those and then I also got the avocado
lime ranch because it's so bomb if you
guys have never had it honestly I highly
recommend so yeah normally I'll just
come home I'll eat my food by my laptop
which is what you have to sitting on
right now and I'm going to watch a few
YouTube videos catch up on all the drama
that's going on but I love drama
channels not because I'm relevant and
any of them I just think they're so
funny to like know everyone else's
business
so somebody right now all sorts right I
want a nice cutback on sequences that
regular customers don't know
about what no wallet point is paying for
any department that they put in we all
need and I was really attractive of me
eating but I am hopping in the shower
now because I feel so super gross after
working out and can we just talk about
what my hair is doing honestly I'm so
over it but yeah this is me just dancing
in the shower and singing to Kalani's
new album
so I fetch my shower I normally will
just sit at my little vanity here with
the light is so pop it on this with this
oh girl let me just said also I
definitely got some soap in my eyes you
see how irritated this is just one soap
in my eye in the shower and I was
freaking hurting so bad normally I do
not brush my hair when I get out of the
shower I literally just put either argan
oil or Moroccan oil whatever oil you
would like to put in your hair to make
it a little bit softer I just add this
in my hair just because I sleep with it
wet and I know not a lot of people do
that but my hair is naturally straight
so when I wake up in the morning it's
just I are not it's not that it's not
too tingly but I add this in there just
make it a little bit more soft and as I
can see the purple is barely in my hair
I'm in the process of getting it like
completely out I don't know will you
guys think are you guys ready for the
blonde to come back let me know in the
comments if you guys want the blonde
back because I feel like a lot of you do
but you guys can't tell this super gray
now I don't wash like my face and like
do all like my cleansing stuff in the
shower just because I'm weird about that
so obviously my makeup came off in the
shower but I'm going to wash my face now
so to wash my face and using Proactiv
3-step system which I've been using this
for like a few months now actually and I
really like it so I normally actually
use it morning and night but the first
step is to use the renewing cleanser and
I love this it has a little bit of
exfoliating beads in it so it actually
really helps get all the dirt out of my
skin and makes it feel super clean and
then this is actually my favorite step
this is the it revitalizing toner and
this feels so good I just put this on a
little cotton pad I think that's what
it's called and then I just put this all
over my face and I kind of focus it more
like where my acne actually is and then
the next step I'm doing is the repair
this is substrate should be repairing
treatment and actually love this and I
put this on my more problematic area so
I put this on my forehead that's where
I'm breaking out some lows right now and
also my
ten and then always write contour it
have like a Templar - but that is
basically my skincare routine and then I
would just head back to my room honestly
guys the feeling that I have after I
like work out and I I honestly don't
sweat that much like that's like
something I'm like always excited about
like I thought when I work out I really
don't sweat very often it's like very
rare that I'm like drenched in sweat but
today for some reason I don't know if it
was just so hot in the gym but I was
like honestly sweating so much and it
feels so good to like come back to my
dorm you know when you just shower and
you feel so clean and you're wearing
sweatpants and like washing my face and
especially I know you guys can see this
which I normally don't talk about this
but I know you guys can see that I'm
having a bit of acne and it's not all
the time it's normally just like
hormonal which I feel like I am like
it's almost that time of the month for
me so I know that's why I'm kind of
breaking out right now but I feel like
since I've been using Proactiv it
seriously has like really helped
obviously right now because I am on my
period
it's like hella like no any other other
people with worse acne but this really
really helps I have mild acne I really
rarely get a lot of pimples also just
added on top of that the green tea
moisturizer which is really really
soothing because after I add the Repair
Cream like the third step it's not
really a moisturizer it is like strictly
for like the like problematic areas so I
add that moisturizer on top of it they
also have which is really cool because
if you guys struggle with blackheads I
check those pockets all the time they
also have a blackhead dissolving gel
which i think is really really awesome
just because I'm always like sitting at
the mirror and like looking at all the
black and to have like why but anyway I
just want to share a little bit of my
skin routine with you guys because I
actually feel like it's really really
been helping my skin and it's really
been working so um yeah I'm going to
share with you guys oh and don't forget
to let me know if you guys want to see a
workout routine because you guys
