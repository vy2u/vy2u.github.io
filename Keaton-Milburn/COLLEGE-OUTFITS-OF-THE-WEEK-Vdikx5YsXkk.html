to be my college outfit of the week
videos so I've been playing - Velma
Sphero for quite a while but I'm finally
getting around to doing it if you guys
are new to my channel I go to ASU and so
I decided that I would film what I'm
wearing throughout this week so I hope
you guys like it and don't forget to
follow me on Instagram and Twitter and
all that kind of stuff and if you guys
like this video please give it a thumbs
up so I know to do more college themed
videos and like outfit of the week
videos that you guys just want me to do
these like every once in a while I might
just like continue to do college outfit
of the week videos just like throughout
the year so you guys can see like my
fall ones my spring wants and things
like that so if you guys like this video
please give it a thumbs up because that
really lets me know that you guys like
it and I'll be talking any more let's
get into the video so for this first
outfit my top is from Urban Outfitters
it just says the special lady on it I
thought it was just really cute and
simple and then my necklaces are from
the M Jewelers and forever 21 and I
paired it with some tiny hoops from
Topshop and then my skirt is just a
denim skirt from Lulu's I absolutely
love wearing denim skirts because it's
so hot and I don't like jean shorts
um and I'm pairing it with these white
Pumas that have red on them I wanted to
tie him the shirt along with the shoes
so this next day me and Kelsey were in
class this is actually at my birthday
but I want to keep it super casual so my
two necklaces the top one is from
forever and the other one is from Urban
Outfitters my top and my bottoms are
from Urban Outfitters so these are just
some green joggers they're kind of old
though so I'm gonna try and find them on
the website and then I'm pairing them
with these platform vans I think these
are just really simple and it gives me
kind of like a more tomboy ish look and
then I just really really liked the top
with this the top is so comfortable and
it's so hot that I didn't want to wear a
t-shirt or anything with it and then I
paired it with gold accessories to make
it a little bit dressier so my watches
Marc Jacobs and yeah that's this look so
this day if you guys saw my Instagram me
and Kelsey bought these t-shirts from
Ali and Arielle calm which has sorority
apparel and this just says I'd rather be
alpha which is the sorority I'm in and I
paired it again with another denim skirt
because I hate wearing jean shorts I
just don't like the feeling of them when
you're like sweating and stuff so this
one is actually
PacSun I think it's Kendall Kylie
collection but I just like that it ties
in the front and then I paired it with
converse and a choker from forever 21 so
this outfit is actually adidas and this
is just my casual outfit I wore all day
this day because I went to the gym this
day which is a rare a rare occasion for
me so I wanted to look sporty and this
is just really cute so this is from 602
which is just like a sporting store that
has a bunch of different things but the
actual outfit is adidas so it looks a
little bit red in some clips but it's
actually maroon and I absolutely love
the way it fits I'm wearing some black
adidas with this I need to figure out
what style these are because I wear them
like every single day but I just really
loved this I loved workout sets for when
I'm going to the gym or anything like
that so I loved this outfit so this
outfit I actually had recruitment and I
changed later that day but I kept it
super cash so I'm wearing these
checkered vans with these sweatpants in
this top so the sweatpants are from
brandy melville and then the top is just
a vintage Harley Davidson tee that I cut
into a crop top and this is probably one
of my favorite things to do is like make
a super casual like sweatpants look but
kind of make it look dressier if you
guys can tell my school outfits are like
casual but like semi cute is what I try
and do because my comfort level is
everything to me so I hope that helps
you guys out thank you guys so much good
for watching us fail again give it a big
thumbs up if you guys liked it and I
will continue to do more videos like
this thank you guys so much for
following me on Instagram you guys have
been like blowing up my Instagram lately

guys so so much and yeah I will see you
