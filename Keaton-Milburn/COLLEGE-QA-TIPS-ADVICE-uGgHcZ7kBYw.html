finally going to be a college Q&amp;amp;A I know
you guys have been like tweeting me and
commentating like when you gonna answer
our questions
we got it's so cloudy out sighs okay um
I'm going to be answering you guys
questions that you guys asked me on my
Instagram I posted it a long time ago
telling you guys to ask me questions and
then I haven't got around to doing it
because college sucks we'll get into
this later so the first most basic
question is where do you go to college I
go to Arizona State so I go to ASU I now
live in Phoenix Arizona and the second
most asked question is why did I choose
Arizona um my major is broadcasting
journalism because I love filming and I
love editing and I really like the
broadcasting aspect of it not more like
film and movies I really like
broadcasting and I lean more towards
sports broadcasting because that's what
I'm most interested in so that is my
major and I chose ASU because I love the
Walter Cronkite School here and also
Arizona I think is amazing if any of you
guys live in Arizona I love it I think
the weather is amazing
I just think everywhere here is so
beautiful and so that's kind of like why
I chose it also my sister and a bunch of
her friends went to ASU so I feel like I
was kind of biased um so I just really
love I think it's awesome another
question is are you planning on joining
a sorority so yes I have already went
through recruitment and rush a lot of
you guys were asking what my get ready
with me like rush sorority Edition kind
of video was and that was me going
through sorority recruitment to find out
what sorority I'm in and I rushed alpha
fee here at Arizona State and I love it
it's amazing I've met so many of my
really good friends that stat out shout
out to Kelsey and Tori this is for you
guys since you guys aren't here to be in
my college Q&amp;amp;A I'm gonna shout you guys
out
I love you is school really important to
you or would you ever leave college to
pursue YouTube I feel like this is a
really important question because a lot
of youtubers and this is not me like
being rude or anything but a lot of
youtubers like don't go to college and
if they do go to college its online
school which trust me I have online
classes online college is not easy it's
hard so don't let anyone fool you out
but a lot of youtubers don't go to
college and that's because one YouTube
is their career and as I realized being
in college
YouTube is so so hard when you're in
college because I'm so overwhelmed with
so much work it's not that the classes
are extremely hard it's just I don't
have time to like sit down and talk
about my favorite things or talk to a
camera for 30 minutes when it's like
okay I have a deadline due here I have
projects due then it's so hard kind of
like managing time so I'm trying my best
and that's kind of why my videos have
been really simple lately because it's
really hard to find time to like go out
and like fill my outfits and be like
this is what I'm doing because that
takes so much time and you guys wouldn't
think that but it really YouTube is a
really big time commitment so managing
that with college is really hard but I
don't think that I would ever leave
college to do YouTube I really want my
education and broadcasting journalism is
like what I really really want to do so
I don't think as much as I love YouTube
and I love you guys like my education is
super important to me so it definitely
would stay in college go to school kids
how often do you see your family so I
see my family pretty often I travel a
lot especially for YouTube and like
different events and a lot of times my
mom will come with me on those kind of
things right now I currently have family
weekend so my whole family is like
coming down here like 11 of my family
coming down here and seeing me and like
FaceTime really saves my life I FaceTime
my mom like 4 times a day about
everything going on in my life so family
is like really really important to me
and I feel like that was like the
hardest thing was moving was leaving my
family not being as involved but I feel
like I'm still just as involved I'm
keeping up with them I'm
so media and I talk to them all the time
so it's not too difficult do you think
high school prepared you for college so
in my opinion I don't think this is what
I would say I don't think that my senior
year at all prepared me for college
because I literally didn't do anything
my senior year um I do think that like
my junior year and like getting my
grades up and like making sure like I
had certain grades to like meet this
like I feel like that really really
helped me I also took dual credit
classes in high school and that really
really helped me a lot because they were
just like college classes here so I kind
of have an understanding do you have
your car in college yes I brought my car
here my stuff that actually like drove
at you but it's here now and it's like
been a lifesaver because there's like
four different campuses of classes at
ASU so going back and forth and just
wanting to go shopping I really want my
own car I don't want it uber everywhere
wherever okay tips for studying in exams
okay so I know this now because I've
taken exams this is also why I waited to
do this QA because I wanted to make sure
that I like got a good feel for college
before it was like the first week it was
like I hate my college I hate everyone
which like I don't so um tips for
studying for exams I would definitely
say like everyone says don't step to
4:00 in the morning studying study over
periods of days like if for for me I go
like online and I'll do like 20
questions on the review and then the
next I'll do like the next 20 now do the
next 20 because if you just sit down and
like try and do it all in one it's like
you're memorizing the stuff you're doing
other than like learning it and if I do
it over different periods of days I know
it better is that when it's the exam
it's random just like how when I studied
it so I don't that made sense but that's
how I do it over over a period of time
what are your tips for managing stress
so I get very very stressed out very
very overwhelmed really easily and when
I get overwhelmed I like don't talk to
anyone like I just sit here and like try
and figure my life out like I just don't
socialize and that I feel like that
helps me not
rising because I'm able to focus on like
what I I need to like put my priorities
in check so if that helps you guys that
all of you guys are feeling stressed out
I make a list of everything I need to do
and then I just slowly start like
crossing them all so it'll be like the
littlest things like take a shower do
that like it'll just be everything but
when you make a list and you start
crossing those things off you feel less
stressed out because you feel like
you're getting more done so normally I
like to make a list of things I need to
do homework things I need to study for
what I need to do for tomorrow and I
also like really like to get a head on
things so like if I know like next
Friday I have a project do like let's
start on it now and over a period of
time I'll get to it and that helps me
like narrow my stress down if that makes
sense a lot of you guys are asking if I
have a backpack in college yes I have a
backpack and you honestly don't need
it's not like if your kindergarten year
you'll need a crayon box of all this
stuff I literally just have a notebook a
planner I put my laptop in my backpack
and then a few pens and a calculator and
that's literally it and some days if I
don't have a certain class I'll just
like take my laptop out or my calculator
out it's really easy nothing crazy
I don't have a lot of stuff I carry my
bag also a lot of you guys are asking me
for a dorm tour I already did that so go
click it right here it's like actually
gotten so many views and I'm so happy
because I worked really hard for me and
my mom worked really hard I'm decorating
my room and making it feel comfortable
so if you guys haven't seen yet go click
it it'll be in the little box thing
right here and in the description um so
the last question I'm going to answer is
how did you guys know what school you
what school I wanted to go to so I feel
like I kind of knew which one I wanted
to go to when I narrowed it down because
I was like ok I feel like I fit in here
also go on college tours I would
definitely suggest going to the campuses
and getting a feel for it and like
meeting with other people and just
seeing how that people are on campus I
know that's like seems like it's kind of
judgmental but when you see other people
walk you're on a campus and like you
feel like oh I could fit in with them or
like oh I don't know if I'm like like
this you know you can kind of tell a
feel for the college so I suggest doing
that to narrow down you guys options and
also for me I felt like I knew I wanted
to go to ASU because one I really wanted
a college II school I really wanted a
football team I wanted to like have
sororities I wanted there to be clubs I
wanted everything to be very involved
and like very spirited and that was
important to me so when I went to
another college I looked at in
California it was very small and private
and it was a good college and everything
but it's not what my voices weren't like
it wasn't exactly what I wanted to
experience I wanted to have like every
aspect of college and so that's what I
felt really important and then I also
knew there's like that little trick that
you can do if you say like ASU is my
first school and then UCLA is Tales
whatever you just that's not what I was
debating between but anyway
ASU would be heads UCLA would be tails
and you flip it and say it lands on UCLA
but you're like oh I really like ASU
then you probably know like that's where
you want to be if you're picking the
opposite one then you kind of already
know and for the most part I'm pretty
like straightforward I know what I like
and what I don't like so wasn't too
terribly hard for me but I'm really
happy with where I tell us I hope you
guys got some tips some helpful things
from this video I know this video is
super long overdue and there was a ton
of questions I know you guys are asking
tons of questions about College so
hopefully with on like later videos and
stuff like that I can answer more and
help you guys out but thank you guys so
much for watching this video and I'll
see you guys next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
