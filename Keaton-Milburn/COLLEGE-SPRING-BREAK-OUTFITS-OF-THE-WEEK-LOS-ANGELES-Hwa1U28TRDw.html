but you gotta be there for me too what's
up guys so today's video is going to be
my outfit of the week slash like spring
outfits I'm not sure what I title this
yet I haven't thumbed one of these in
quite a while but you guys were asking
me to film one because I posted all of
these Instagram pictures and you guys
are asking me where every single item
was so I figured I would just film a
video and show you guys where it's all
from this video is not sponsored but I
did want to include that a lot of the
items most of the items that I have can
be found on the app dote which is a
shopping app which I use I have a
profile on and it is so much easier for
you guys to follow me on the app because
I have specific folders like I literally
title this one outfit of the week LA and
all of the items that are in this video
I just will have in the folder that I
got off of don't so you guys know follow
me on there I will put my username right
here as gonna also use the code keen to
get five dollars off which i think is
really cool because it's like anything a
button there you just automatically get
five dollars off with my code so if you
guys want you guys can go follow me on
there it would mean so much to me and
it's so much easier if you guys to see
all the clothes that I'm loving also
have so many other folders like chela
folders and like things like that I'm
calling them folder it's really just
like a list of clothes but anyway I'm
not gonna be talking about that I hope
you guys like this video if you guys are
new here this is your first video of
mine don't forget to hit that subscribe
button and give this video a thumbs up
if you guys wanna see more output of the
week videos and yeah let's just get into
the video so for the first outfit I
absolutely love it's much more edgier
vibe so the top is from brandy melville
and I paired it with a leather jacket
from misguided my jeans are from Topshop
and they're so comfortable that they're
Jamie style jeans and I just had my
Gucci belt on it I wear this a lot in
all of these and then these are my new
favorite shoes I got them off of dope
but they're just Nikki Air Force Ones
and I wore them like every day of this
trip so I'm so obsessed and then my bag
is from forever 21
everyone so ask me where it's from and
it's literally from forever 21 so for
this day I wore a super comfortable
outfit the top sweater and pants are all
from Urban Outfitters the pants are so
comfortable like seriously they have
them in so many other patterns on Urban
Outfitters if you guys are interested in
not just this pattern but they were so
comfortable and it kind of looks like I
put
but it feels like pajamas and then I
paired them with the Nike Air Force Ones
off of DOE and the same purse is also
from Donuts be forever 21 one also if
you guys use the code Keeton on don't
you guys can get five dollars off your
next purchase isn't sponsored I'm just
on you guys
no because it also helps me out so yeah
next outfit so this day at my look was
probably one of my favorites I just
really loved this outfit and the style
of it so the top is from Urban
Outfitters just a silk top that I tied
out I paired it with this jacket like
trench looking thing from Zara and then
my jeans are also from Urban Outfitters
you guys know what wear these like in
every in serum picture and then I paired
them with my Steve Madden booties I got
these forever ago off of Lulu so I'll
try link them down below I also had
these same for everything one bag and I
think my favorite part of this was the
earrings I had they're from Free People
and they're just like huge and like just
gold and really really pretty I got them
also off of dough so I will link
everything that I got off of dope down
below but I love the way it made this
look it looks leukemia and just really
really fun so this was probably one of
my favorites so this next outfit you
guys probably saw in the old haul of
mine I've been saving it to take a
really cute Instagram picture in and I
just want to wear it out one day really
nice so I saved it for LA so it is a set
the top and trousers are both from
misguided I just more like a Victoria's
Secret like lacy bra underneath it and
then I paired it with these Steve Madden
shoes these are so comfortable and they
have the minutest well so I'll link them
down below but they're so comfortable
and I just really really love to this
outfit because I feel like it's
different it was just the perfect outfit
to go to dinner in and just like dress
up and take pictures and so I absolutely
love this
this outfit is really simple and really
basic but I wanted to show you guys how
I style just simple pieces so my top is
from brandy melville and I tied it up to
make it more cropped and then I paired
it with my Gucci belt and my Topshop
Jamie styled jeans they're just the
high-rise ones in black and then I just
wore my Nike Air Force ones you could
dress this look up and wear like black
booties but I just decide to go casual
my hoops
I feel like make this such a statement
look so these are from Urban Outfitters
they're just silver hoops and then I
really wanted to draw attention to the
hoops so I pulled my hair back in a
tight ponytail and I feel like that
really helps it look look a little bit
more like sophisticated and simple so I
loved this for this last look I actually
think this might be my favorite out of
all of them so this top I'm obsessed
with and I feel like it went perfectly
because I went to the Beverly Hills
hotel this day so it's just an army
green top I got it from revolt but I got
it off of dope and then I paired it with
my Jamie style jeans just like regular
jeans these are so comfortable and then
I paired it with these white booties
they're from Urban Outfitters they're
actually like snakeskin faux snakeskin
but you can't really tell in the video
and then I just had my forever 21 bag
and I feel like this look was just super
casual and a top that people normally
wouldn't wear out but I really wanted to
style it for this day and I feel like it
fits super well thank you guys so much
