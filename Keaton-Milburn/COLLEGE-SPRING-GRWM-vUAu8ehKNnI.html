I'm literally drinking coffee at 2:00
p.m. in the middle of the day that is
how you know the series coffee issue
let's just jump right into it I'm using
Sephora collection beauty amplifier base
this is ultra smoothing primer love love
prime your skin guys have you guys seen
that thing on Twitter and it's like so
orange and it's like when you prime your
skin versus when you don't and it's like
for people who say like oh my god
primers don't do anything I was like I'm
gonna send this to everyone I know who
doesn't use a primer because primers
help so much especially ones like this
that are smoothing like it literally
just makes it makes my skin feel like
velvet like just smooths it all out
primers are mozzie if you're not using
primer you're like
next I'm going with foundation this is a
cosmetics in the shade fair as you can
tell I am clearly see through at the
moment like I have no spray tan on
whatsoever so my foundations I have like
probably I don't even know how many
foundations I would say I have I have so
many foundations and none of them match
my skin right now I need to start
investing in like actual good like when
I'm pale foundation because this one's
good I love this one but it's like my
favorite foundations I'm like I don't
get to wear those when I'm pale because
I only have like one I wanted to
support today to get the affinity Beauty
foundation like to match my skin right
now and I literally don't know how to
match my skin whatsoever like I like
always pick the wrong foundation shade
for myself I always do like I will think
it looks good in the store and then I'll
come home and I'm like girl you just
spent sixty something dollars on a
foundation that's like three shades
darker or three shades lighter like does
anyone else struggle with matching their
foundation because I do since its spring
I really really like what my freckles
are out so I don't put foundation over
my nose that is like one of the things I
like to do when it's like summer /
spring is not cover my nose because I
like to have freckles oh and I just
think they're so cute and they're like
very very prominent now that it's hot in
Arizona I hope you guys can see them but
they're like next I'm just going with my
concealer and a concealer my under eye
is because lord knows I have not slept
enough this week like I just want to let
you guys know that Coachella is so close
around the corner and I have one outfit
and I bought it yesterday like I
literally just went and bought an entire
outfit and I was just like keep me why
did you wait last minute to figure out
why you're wearing a Coachella like you
know everyone's gonna have a look and
you're gonna be standing there like what
like why why did you wait this long like
I do this like all the time for things
that are actually important but it's not
important I'm like oh my god yes I have
a look and then when it's like something
relevant I'm like we were paper bag
I cannot believe I am about to graduate
okay I'm not about to graduate and I
can't believe I'm about to be a junior
in college like I feel like we're you
know we're on the same like page right
here you guys just started watching my
college videos like I just got in
college like I've only been here for a
little bit it's like I only have two
more years and then I literally have to
figure out what I'm doing with my life
if that's not the most terrifying thing
like you've ever heard of I don't know
like what is like I'm just like I don't
know what I'm doing with my life like I
learn Reese and talk to a camera for
majority of my day so there's nothing on
this I'm just literally going oh my god
speaking not like putting stuff on me I
want the Rihanna body lava so freaking
bad like have you guys been watching all
the videos she keeps posting on Twitter
I'm like I want to look like that I mean
I'm not gonna ever look like Rihanna
but I want body lava so so bad like last
time when like the French Beauty came
out I like didn't buy that much because
I was just like I don't know like I
don't need more makeup
I need the Bardo lava I'm literally not
getting it like I have to buy it I have
to fight it okay so shout out to this
girl she deemed me and she said if you
get a bronzer that has none whatever
this word is in it it will help not clog
your pores thank you guys notice in a
lot of my other videos I had makeup tour
Elsa I used to get pimples
all right here where I would contour and
I'll always be like well I mean I don't
know what to do because I'm always gonna
contour my face so I know what to do
well I found a bronzer the hourglass
bronzer and luminous bronze light this
is like the ambient one I've been using
this for the past few months because she
message means if you find a good bronzer
that doesn't clog your pores which this
one doesn't then it will help with
pimples and it has helped so much I'm
not even kidding guys it's the only
brother I use and what's good as I use
it when I'm like really pale like this
and I use it when I'm really tan so I
really really like the bronzer if you
guys struggle with getting breakouts
right here or anywhere this really
really helps like I'm not kidding I
still how
like a little bit of breakouts there but
I just also think that's because of me
doing like other things like I work out
sometimes with makeup on things like
that and I feel like that really doesn't
help my skin but this bronzer has been
super helpful and I'm so glad she told
me that because I was like I really
really needed to get rid of the acne
that was on my cheeks and in that area I
also don't cream contour anymore you
guys know I used to do that all the
freaking time and I don't cream contour
anymore just because I'm like I'm so
over it like I just want powder this is
the Urban Decay sin afterglow palette I
am going to go in with this shade PSA
and I'm gonna use it as a blush color
because I really don't want to do a
bright blush color just want something
like very light and not so I'm not you
guys know me in my blush I'm not like a
pinky why I've had to go as I wear like
a pink shirt in whatever I'm also going
to go on with the highlighting shades
I'm gonna mix this one and this one
together spotlight and sin and I'm into
a full highlight lately like look at
that I used to you guys know I used to
do like a little dab but now I'm like
girl it's summer it's spring you can
look sweaty and glowy if you feel like
it I have a pimple right here on my
cheekbone and I just keep adding
highlighter over and I'm like yeah girl
just bring it out like just just show
everyone
and also highlight your mustache in case
you're wondering okay for I shadow I'm
really not into eyeshadow as much as I
used to be like I used to do like smoky
eyes all the time but I'm really into
like one eyeshadow color a little bit of
highlight and I really like for my
eyeliner to pop so that's what I'm gonna
be doing I'm literally just gonna
probably do two shades I'm going to set
with just like this white shade set my
whole lid and then I'm gonna go in with
like a lighter brown color just so I can
give us some like depth to my eyes I
know you guys are like why did you do
this whole tutorial just to do two
eyeshadows because I just feel like this
is like this summer spring vibe that I'm
going for like I love the pop of color
look right now I'm Larry just taking a
light brown shade I'm probably gonna put
this in the crease first and then all
over the lid but I want to keep it like
dark in the crease so now I'm going a
Miss for collection eyeliner this one is
classic line silica graphic this is just
black eyeliner I'm going to apply
falsies today so I'm gonna find this so
that I can have a nice line to blend my
false lashes with I wish so badly I
could do winged liner like one of these
days in my life God is going to bless me
with the ability it's doing liner but I
just can't do it I literally can't do it
I'm going this for collection lash craft
big volume mascara this is what I'm
going to apply first before I put the
false ones on now because I want a
little bit more of a pop of color I'm
gonna go in with the Urban Decay
alkaline eyeliner and this is just like
a dark purplish pink it looks really
dark on like the outside of it when you
actually put it on your eyes it's way
more pink so I really I love adding just
like a bottom eyeliner that's a color
because it just makes your eyes look so
much brighter if you have blue eyes it
just looks really really cool if you
have brown eyes it's good to do like a
green or a blue though it just looks
really awesome
I know if you guys can see it on camera
but in person it's so pretty like I
honestly I don't wear a lot of colors
but if you guys want to try out like a
pop of color I definitely would try out
like a colored eyeliner on the lower
lash where you guys could do a color
eyeliner on like the upper the upper
lash on your eyelid and it would
honestly look really really cool I just
like the way like that one looks just
pink and pretty it makes my eyes just
like a little bit more now for the fun
part I'm adding this for collection
lashes on these are sidekick number five
lashes I am obsessed the flank of flying
applying false lashes right now I used
to not if you guys watch all my
tutorials but lately I've just been like
you know like it's not that hard I think
it's cuz I didn't know how to do it I
just so much screaming and just to know
how to do it so I was like whatever I'd
never need them like I look fine without
them the more you apply false lashes
like every other day the more you're
like yeah I need false lashes every day
and these are perfect because they're
for like this Center which is where I
kind of lock lashes like my outer corner
has a lot of lot a lot of lashes but my
inner in the middle not so much so these
lashes are perfect also don't get
acrylic nails because you can't open
anything
how did I just get that that easily oh
my god I'm screaming I feel like I need
more highlight so I'm going in with opal
from both the cosmetics because this
always always comes through
whenever I'm just not feeling like I
look as good now for the lips which I'm
so excited about because this is a
girl's dream right here are getting to
choose from 90 different shades is a
blessing in life I feel like I really
want a color to lip but I also don't
know if I just wanted to mood I think
I'm too pale to do a nude color I think
I should definitely do like a little bit
of a darker one this shade is 80 oh I'm
really really like that color oh yeah I
actually really like this one this is
like oh really we really really
appreciate it okay I'm gonna put this
one right here because yeah I like that
one we could go with a new color this
one is in the number 75 oh I love that
okay I'm so sad no I don't know what to
do like the nude is so pretty too
what do I do I just like put them both
on inside why does it matter you know I
could do them all there's also metallic
shades a ball I think I'm gonna be basic
and go with the number 75 and do this
all over and then I'm gonna put the
metal shade in the center just to give
it like a little bit more of a pop oh
yeah my fan love this shade
yeah I love that
now I'm gonna take the medal not me use
a lot because I don't my whole lip to be
metal and this is pretty pigmented so
I'm just gonna oh there we go okay okay
so for a collection come through yeah
now we're gonna set this makeup needs to
say on Jo just keep going even though
you know like okay it's that girl
