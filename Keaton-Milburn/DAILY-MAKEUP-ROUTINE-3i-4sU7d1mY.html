makeup tutorial and it was like super
super requested like I get this all the
time in my ask on tumblr and on my
Instagram so pretty much I'm just gonna
be telling you how I do my everyday
makeup I don't wanna make up every
single day but when I do this isn't
makeup that I do and you guys requested
it so I said you do it for you guys
and yeah weirdest so the first thing I
like to do is use st. Ives apricot scrub
and I just use it to exfoliate my face
and make sure everything goes off of it
before I use my makeup I will then use
my Dermalogica skin smoothing cream
which is just kind of like a moisturizer
and I put that on my face before I do
all my makeup if you don't have long
hair you can skip this step but I like
to pull my hair back with a headband
because I don't like it getting in my
face and if you're wondering where this
headband is from it's from Lululemon I
will be using my Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer in the color nude and I'm
gonna be applying that with my tart
brush which just works really really
well and I'm just using the top of my
hand as a flat surface and pretty much
I'm just gonna put that on my foundation
brush and blend it all into my face so
it matches the rest of my body and to
help look a little bit more natural I
also like to blend it into my jaw line
and underneath my neck just to make sure
it's all blended and does I don't have
any sharp lines
I'm using my Maybelline instant age
rewind and the number 215 it's really
light in pretty much I use it as a
highlighter I put it underneath my eyes
and it just makes my eyes look bigger
and I don't look as sleepy and then I
apply it to the bridge of my nose to
make it appear smaller than fixed this
is just a basic foundation brush which I
used to film the rest of my highlighting
in so it doesn't look as defined as a
line and it just makes everything look a
lot more natural
for contouring i'm using my fit me
foundation by maybelline in the number
310 and i'm just going to be applying
lines across my forehead and down the
side of my face to about the top of my
ears and then after that i'm going to be
outlining my cheekbones while I make the
fishy face to just make sure I'm getting
the exact spot
to blend that all in I'm just using a
basic PD butcher
I'm using a tiny bit of Laura Mercier
smooth finish foundation powder just to
set everything and make sure my
foundation looks good and the rest of my
highlighting and contouring as well to
finish off my contouring i'm using a
Tarte bronzer which is in this shade
Park a princess and I'm just using a
angled blush brush to apply it to the
top of my cheekbones and all along that
area which is where you should be
contouring to make your face look
smaller I'm using my Dior eyebrow pencil
in the color sand to just fill in the
rest of my eyebrows and make them look
more full and thick
I'm using the benefit speed brow gel to
just hold my eyebrows in place so they
don't move around and look really crazy
during the day
for eyeshadow I'm going to be using the
Naked palette by urban decay the first
color I'm using is gonna be virgin and
that's gonna go right underneath my brow
bone the second color I'm using is naked
which that will go over my whole entire
lid and I'm just gonna put that all over
and make sure it's blended and easy I'll
be using maybelline line stiletto liquid
eye liner which you can get at any
drugstore or anything I'm just gonna do
a really really thin line really close
to my lash line
I don't like thick eyeliner and I don't
really do a cat eye so that's all
for mascara I'm going to be using my
favorite mascara its benefit they're
real and this just makes my eyelashes
look super long and I just love it it's
sephora's number one selling mascara so
you should definitely go get this last
but not least I'm just using a basic
black eye liner by L'Oreal and I'm gonna
put a really really light line of that
underneath my waterline
the last step is a list and I'm going to
be using a Mac lip liner first and the
shade hip and happy and then I'm going
to be going over that with a MAC
lipstick and pink plaid I'm basically
gonna outline the bottom of my lips and
then fill in the rest of my lips with
the lip liner
to make my lips look a little bit more
full I just go over it lightly with emit
of my Tarte bronzer
once all that's done I can just take my
hair out and I'm good to go
