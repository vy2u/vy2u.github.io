interest in Vale I just officially
because tonight I'm literally looking
make it let me Jim you guys outs you
guys can see that I really am dressed
guys what's up guys so I was waiting for
it to stop pouring it down raining
outside but it literally is never a cue
that a lot of you guys were asking me in
my last video what happened to my car
because when I was filming my top was
down blah blah blah I have a convertible
and water it's actually leaking in
through my convertible and has soaked
the inside of my car and because it
rains every single day it doesn't ever
get better so yeah my car is curly a
little water a little bit but it's fine
I was doing my makeup here today and as
I was doing it I was like wow this
makeup would be so pretty if I like went
on a date somewhere like to a nice
restaurant or something and then I was
like I don't go on dates well just get
started because I'm kind of done just
rambling about me being single so I am
using the poor vanishing moisturizer
this is a not hydrating eye primer which
is really weird because when I found
this by the way is from Estee Lauder
it's like essay edit I believe yeah when
I found this I was like how is this pore
minimizing and moisturizing because
normally if you have a pore minimizing
primer it feels you can feel the
difference but this was my face just
like getting read that was really weird
right guys okay anyway this one you can
actually tell it really is moisturizing
my skin but at the same time it's like
good at burning
getting rid of all my pores you know if
you're on a date you don't want them to
know you have pores so you have to use a
pore minimizing primer to make it look
like they're not even here the next
thing is the Urban Decay all nighter
water
proof long-wear liquid foundation this
is for one if it's pouring raining
outside and you can hear the rain - if
you have there goes on a date you want
to have waterproof long wear full
coverage foundation they are never going
to know what your skin looks like
underneath this stuff goes a long way
the first time I use it I pump like four
pumps on my hand and I literally need
like half a pump I'm going to do it once
oh that honestly honestly put in too
much it literally goes so far okay my
foundations on it was just raining so
loud that I couldn't even talk with my
foundation so um yeah that's that it
looks really dark but it always does a
part with my concealer on it's going to
be fine we're going to lose guys next
we're going to do is take this Urban
Decay concealer and we are just going to
conceal all of my insecurities away
because no one likes an insecure date
okay so I want to know if any of you
guys have ever been on like a really
terrible date or like it was really like
it was just really bad in general I mean
I've never really been on like a really
bad date I've had some awkward awkward
dates before like it was just like
please get me out of here but I want to
know if you guys that's been like really
really bad days comment comments down
below and let me know what's like the
worst day you guys have ever been on my
ideal date it's like chick-fil-a also
I'm wearing taupe because you know what
they say the bigger the hoop I don't
know why I'm like this no but honestly I
literally wear hoops like every single
day of my life like I will wear hoops
with like a big t-shirt like I will wear
Nike shorts or like Lulu leggings and
like hoop in a t-shirt like I don't know
why but it's like I don't know what like
I don't know what what other earrings do
you wear if you're not wearing coop you
know I'm not I'm not a side kind of gal
definitely Mughal pose
oh now to be more dramatic if you're on
a date and it's like the first time
you're meeting then you really don't
want them to know that you don't have
cheekbones so we're going to contour see
it's not like a like really aggressive
contour it's just like a little
something to make it look like my face
is a little slimmer then it really
really is I'm using my Laura Mercier
translucent powder to bake underneath my
eyes and set my forehead in my chin
because when I get like scared and
nervous I start sweating and I would
definitely be sweating on a date so I
need to set that because if they have an
oily chin significantly help the
lighting in this room keeps changing
it's really weird because now it's
making me look like red and orange in
real life
nuts color okay I'm going to fill my
brows in really quickly with the
anastacio a soft brown eye pencil also
like I'm not even I'm not even like
bitter or anything I am going dates like
not even mad about it like I'm not even
hurt I've got foundation all over
not even we're not even mad if you're
about to own a date and you're feeling
really nervous you need to just turn
some jams on and like like gets like get
it together because you can be like that
on a date let's just pause the jams
because the eye shadow for this look is
probably like my favorite thing so it
actually isn't be new a color pop I love
I love Sarah I think this is a collab
with someone on social media I'm so
sorry I don't know but M
her name is Island Sarah I believe and I
got this in the mail and I was so happy
because these shades are so good no they
look really like basic but there's like
a setting shade with the highlighting
shade this is like a crease table
designs and then that I scoop in my
crease up so that's what we're going to
do okay I feel like this is a little
better I feel like you guys get to skip
just more but basically I'm literally
just adding in this light brown shade in
the crease then I'm going to go in with
this one it looks brown but it's
actually almost like plum if that makes
sense and I'm going to put this in the
crease and then I'm going to put this in
the corner and a crease so I set it
right there concentrating it there and
then I'm going to blend it like the
people do people still go on dates like
the people go out to dinner like two
people say hi can I take you to date
cause I feel like I've literally
non-existent but if it does exist
they're probably a pedophile now I'm
going to take this shade right here it's
like shimmery it almost has a little bit
of pink in it when you put on the lid
you can't really tell so I'm going to
put it in
the inner corner because he needs better
he needs to be looking that's where my
date needs to be looking into my eyes
now I'm going to take the same dark
shade right there and I'm going to
smudge out my lower lashline because
that just makes this look a lot better
so that is eyeshadow lately I've been
using the Urban Decay glide on pencil
and Sabbath which is a Navy eyeliner
which it was kind of a weird color but I
have blueish like green eyes and I feel
like the Navy really really helps my
eyes pop like no matter what look I'm
doing and it was such a weird like liner
color to go with this but I did it
yesterday and it looks really good so
I'm going again
like like you see the difference in this
mascara like the difference that it made
in my lashes it's honestly amazing it's
so like black or bronzer I've been using
this combo for like forever so I'm going
to use why was I looking at them like I
don't even know what they are there's
mascots starbursts like highlighting
thing and then they bag a bronzer and in
Panama Sun which is a super super dark
shade but we're going to it this is the
best song to play if you are not feeling
yourself or your budget on a date and
you need to start feeling yourself
for blood I'm using like an oldie but a
goodie I haven't used this in forever
this is the Sigma blush and quarter Rosa
I think so I don't know but it's really
really pretty natural blush because the
eyes are so dark
I really don't really feel the need to
put a dark blush on just for you Kel
this song is for you
okay so for list
I was really debating yesterday I wore
this lip combo and this is also from the
Isle of Sarah colour-pop collection I
feel like I want to go with the dark
lifts so that's what we're going to do
so this is just a lip liner and I
actually love this color like it looks
so so good so I'm going to add the ultra
matte lip this is in the shade mamacita
ooh so this is the final look so I
actually really really love this look
you don't have to wear this on a date
you can wear it on a date I'm obviously
not bring it on down I'm just wearing it
