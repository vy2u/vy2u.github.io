to be a Q&amp;amp;A and I really wanted to film
this because I haven't done the Q&amp;amp;A in a
while and also I've just if you guys
follow me on Twitter I just been feeling
so uninspired with my videos lately and
I felt like there just I don't know like
they're just kind of boring and I'm
talking about makeup and I really just
want to talk to you guys about other
things other than makeup so I figured
I'm doing Q&amp;amp;A cuz you guys always ask me
questions on Twitter so if you guys also
want to follow me on any of my social
media they will be linked right here and
down in the description bar and don't
forget to subscribe for more videos and
let's get into it the first question is
how do I cut off fake friends so um I
would say the first thing cutting off
fake friends is kind of realizing you
have big friends in your life I know
that sounds kind of dumb but honestly
sometimes hard to realize people's
motives with you and that kind of thing
and people like talking badly behind
your back then I I'm not like that much
of a confrontational person like I will
if I need to but honestly if someone's
just being fake to me I will just slowly
like stop texting them as much stop
hanging out with them as much just kind
of a distance myself and then eventually
they like why are you like why aren't we
talking more or if they're like really a
fake friend they'll just kind of like
let it slide and you guys just won't
talk anymore and that's just kind of how
it always says that's how I am
that's what is for me if there's someone
in my life that I'm just like no I don't
think we're really good friends I think
you're just kind of like it then it's
normally how they fade apart
how do you feel about big shots and new
music and I I'm so excited you guys know
my favorite artist my favorite rapper or
my favorite person in the entire world
is Big Sean if you guys don't know that
I don't know where you guys been
if you're new to this channel Big Sean
loved my life yes new music has two
songs out balance back and no more
interviews and no more interviews is my
absolute favorite right now love that
song so I will link and double it I also
have a Spotify where I have my monthly
favorite songs like my that was weird
that was pretty weird my favorite songs
in the month I'll link that down below
if you guys are interested in but I'm so
excited for his new music his album it's
gonna be amazing
do you feel as though you feel less
stressed or more stressed without
your family in Arizona um I feel like it
is oh I mean it's obviously more
stressful because I'm in school and
school stresses me out in general and
also I get kind of stressed out when I'm
not with my family and they're like
doing something that I want to be a part
of I like it's sad your stress and then
like I want to be with my family so
that's one thing that stresses me out
but other than that I really do love
Arizona I'm not like sad here you're not
miserable like I promise I'm having a
good time I do it kind of sad though
when I miss my family or if school was
like overwhelming me then I'm like kill
me if you could go back in time where
would you go what is something you
appreciate a lot if I could go back in
time I would probably either go back to
Europe my senior trip I messed that trip
so much it was such like it was such an
amazing trip and I honestly like I could
just do it all over again that was so
fun and what's something you appreciate
a lot I really appreciate my friendships
that I have I really appreciate the
relationships I felt with people in
Arizona and like even the ones I'm
keeping like do I really value a
relationship that's something I
appreciate a lot tips on making new
friends so this is something I always
keep in mind especially like I know a
lot of you guys are like thinking about
this also when you're going to college
and for me I I know I like talked a lot
and I'm always like whenever it seems
like I'm an extrovert but like in real
life I really just don't like talking to
people
I'm very awkward and everyone's awkward
in their own ways but I am kind of
awkward so what I like to keep in mind
when I'm meeting people is be that
person you would want to meet other
people so like when you see someone
across the room like oh my god I want to
be their friend it's probably not
because they're hiding in a corner on
their phone and not talking it's
probably because they're all going there
sharing things with you like on a
personal love it's like oh my god like I
did this today no so embarrassing stuff
like that like you really connect to
people who actually like open up and
aren't so like one-sided and like
closed-minded that kind of thing so I
always feel like when I'm
trying to make new friends just be that
person to other people so when you're in
the group of a bunch of people stick out
on your own like don't just like to sit
there on your phone and ignore them and
be like why aren't they talking to me
like you have to make the effort so
that's something I keep in mind to make
new friends
do you have a crush unless it's Big Sean
um like probably not like he's the only
person I can possibly think of um that I
actually like so what's your favorite
show at the moment I watched so many
shows in the money I watched so many
shows of freaking what month was in
October I finished series like that I
watched American Horror Story I watched
all of scream queens and I also just
finished new girl and then I started one
other series I haven't finished I don't
remember the name of it I watched series
like I I finished series so quickly so
right now I'm ending I'm finishing up
new girl and it's so good you guys know
I love new girl those are some shows
I've been liking right now if you guys
have any other really good suggestions
of shows to like watch on Netflix
comment comments down below I finished
stranger things I finished like I
watched like every series I finished
orange is the new black I finished a lot
of series so common things maybe not
other people have watched before I
really want to hear about those do you
find that people in school want to be
your friend just because of YouTube um
like not really I don't I don't think
I'm that cool like people aren't like oh
my god yeah I'm gonna use her like use
me for what like I'm looking up
everyone's in the same major so like
making a youtube channel is not that
weird considering my major my major is
broadcast journalism and the high school
was a little bit more we're known was
making YouTube videos no one was like
doing anything like that on social media
in my high school where I was like there
was no one really doing that so that's
why I was kind of weird and
maybe that would be a thing so I'm
trying to be my friend because of that
but I really I don't really struggle
with that I have a really good group of
like solid close friends I know really
well so I never thought anyone was like
trying to like worm their way in how do
you personally feel about
self-confidence and do you have any
advice on how to achieve it um I am
actually making a video on this really
really soon I like all about
self-confidence and a lot of things that
have been like running through my mind
lately I've been thinking about a lot of
stuff that sounds really fake making a
video really soon on like self
confidence like a lot of things I'm just
like been dealing with and stuff like
that so if you guys want to comment some
self-confidence related questions down
below please comment them like let me
know what you guys want to see I would
like to see self-confidence questions
and like what you guys want to know
about me like my kind of like deal with
that and like what would help you guys
because I am making a video on it really
really soon and so yeah the question was
how you personally feel about self
confidence and do you have any advice on
how to achieve it I'm gonna be making a
whole video on this so just comment on
the comments down below questions
related to that best way to reflect on
God and such I tweeted the other day and
I was just like it was just like a
thought of mine because I've been laying
in bed like scrolling on Twitter for so
long and I was like if I can sit and
like not be bored on Twitter and like
like I was so tired and then I got in
bed and I was like scrolling on Twitter
and you're so awake like going on
Instagram and everything and I was like
if I'm awake enough to like scroll on
Twitter for two hours when I thought I
was tired I'm awake enough to like go to
my Bible up and like read my Bible and
like read scriptures that like I know I
should be reading and I was just like I
was just think about that Nick tweeted
the other day and I was like if you're
awake and have to scroll through Twitter
you're awake enough to go to your Bible
app and start reading it and so I think
something the question was best way to
reflect on God and such I think just do
it like let make time for it that's
something that's like really important
it's really hard also being a student
not just in college in high school and
like you guys everyone's busy everyone's
doing stuff but I feel like it is so
important like every single night go to
bed like saying your prayers if you're
really just obviously if this is
if you're not really just this doesn't
really - but for me every night I go to
bed like I fall asleep saying my prayers
like I am thinking my prayers I'm like
talking to God and that kind of things
so that's how I fall asleep so I feel
like just make time for it what is the
craziest thing you've ever done I really
don't know probably like wear white
jeans on my period just girly Thanks
okay actually that was the last question
so thank you so much you're tweeting me
so many questions I had a town that I
didn't get to answer but I am doing a
self confidence video very soon so
comment in the comments down below self
confidence questions like any kind of
question like around that like
depression anything you guys want to
hear about comment comments down below
I'm doing like a very kind of a
different video from this one where I'm
just like answering random things it's
going to be very like centered on things
that I feel strongly about um so yeah
anyways thank you guys so much for
asking me questions I know my videos
been slacking a little bit lately I'm
working on it um anyway I was you guys
