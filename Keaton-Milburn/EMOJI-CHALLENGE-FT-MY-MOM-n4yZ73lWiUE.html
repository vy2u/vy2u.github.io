the emoji challenge is it is basically
you pick five emojis that represent you
the best and so I brought my mom into
this video and i was tagged by halle and
then a couple you guys have requested it
but Holly shout out to you and I just
decided to do it with someone else
because I feel like emoji challenges
like aren't really that fun I don't even
know why it's called a challenge because
it's not really Joan huge pizza so
challenge I mean I guess it is a
challenge because I don't know what
emojis would represent me but we're just
gonna get started to understand one and
then you're gonna say was but I wanted
to do it we're like I say what you are
you want to pick one summer present me
maybe I could pick ones that you are and
you could pick ones that I am that's
what I think reference oh I thought you
were saying like me pick five about
myself and then you hit five more values
like I don't want the student at all
about her no that's not what I was like
the first one that represents you is the
salsa dancer I don't know why but she
really thinks that she is like that
salsa dancer and like after everything
you say you're like really sad see it is
like salsa and I do
no you don't you she has no dancing
skills and it gives us the salsa dancers
I think you just put that afterlife do
the chores so as you use that emailed
you so much dad I get to you like what i
want you to that represents how you feel
yeah my tone yeah so the sauce emoji

nice home to a little girl when Irish is
