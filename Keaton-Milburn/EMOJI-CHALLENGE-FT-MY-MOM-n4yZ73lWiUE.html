know
oh yes the pickup what's up guys today's
video is going to be the emoji challenge
if you guys don't know the emoji
challenge is it is basically you pick 5
emojis that represent you the best and
so I brought my mom into this video and
I was tagged by Hallie and then a couple
you guys have requested it but Hallie
shoutout to you and I just decided to do
it with someone else because I feel like
emoji challenges like aren't really that
fun I don't even know why it's called a
challenge because it's not really a
gentleman to use Pizza challenge I mean
because it is a challenge because I
don't know what emojis would represent
me but we're just gonna get started so I
understand one and then you're gonna say
one but I wanted to do it we're like I
say what you are you want to pick one
summer present me maybe I could pick
ones that you are and you could pick
ones that I am good I think
oh I thought you were saying like me
pick five about myself and then you get
five more about us like I don't want
that all about her no that's not what I
was a fly and the first one that
represents you is the salsa dancer I
don't know why but she really thinks
that she is like that salsa dancer and
like after everything you say you're
like really sad to see it it's like
salsa and I do nobody can tell you she
has no dancing skills and you can just
the salsa dancer because I think you
just put that after life do the chores
so you use that you mode you so much
that gets you like what I want you do
that represents how you feel my tone
yeah so the saucy emoji represents Lila
do it okay so that one's you okay now
you have to come for me I would say I
think if you are gonna make that tell
them why you here that are the loveliest
emoji mm the ear emoji because no that
is not what your ear is it's a very nice
house
to a little girl whatever should they're
gonna think I'm so weird I had an
imaginary friend her name was Thumbelina
no sin dureena enduring that and she
lived in her ear yeah and that was her
home she was a little fairy one time we
were in the car and the window was down
and Thumbelina flew out my ear out the
winner in that scenario send marina blew
out my ear and I made my sister chase
her around my imaginary friend around in
Houston yes we dog input I had slightly
all over the car we're gonna have to get
out run and like you were like crying
she liked it from the tree
yeah she cried like that today but that
would be like my number two the budgie
you can't hit
mom you have to guide us to that because
that's why we had to pull over and like
stuff because you would like cry and
stuff and you still kind of do that mom
is so weak kryla not crying but like
pouting or whining or like just like mom
so I cry emoji and that year emojis it's
gonna pick the bunny because like chubby
bunny and I always just say you have to
be cheeks always he's always saying that
you bet seventy does not you'd be so
much yes you would be like and I would
like play with her cheeks but I was
really like trying to be nice but I said
you always had chubby cheeks so maybe
you are the bunny buddy that's what you
get for saying I'm the karate mochi
through the buddy I always use this
emoji to describe her that angel
Oh because I do I always send that
tonight everyone because everyone are 16
so she's my little angel
the next emoji that would represent you
I think is the little the party like
whoa let the little I'm thinking she
always plans parties she plans like
every event ever and she always wants to
have parties and plan everything ever
sometimes I don't really it's sometimes
she doesn't want to but she does asked
you or we force her to but she always
planted ideas and they're fun and
they're good parties so she's the party
oh yeah the gingerbread party you gonna
pick

couldn't really hear very happy morning

gets really really really don't be like
if I want to have something to say
it's like early in the morning like it's
a great time we have coffee we doing all
that stuff I don't sleep overall the
next one that represents you it's the
airplane because any we travel a lot
together

trip of where we're traveling we fly
about it and she always has fun things

like you could see see that that's you
she like you're just really sneaky and
like you are though like I said there's
no other way to really describe why
you're the smiling little devil you know
gee you just saw like you're just like a
