what's up guys so today's video is going
to be my daily makeup routine and this
is the makeup routine I have been doing
since I have been home which is where I
am right now and since I've had purple
hair I'm kind of switched up some
products so I hope you guys like this
video if you guys aren't yet subscribed
please hit that subscribe button down
below and hit notification so you guys
know when I'm posting and thank guys so
much again for watching and let's get
into the video so starting off I'm using
my Maybelline Dream cushion in the shade
45 I'm obsessed with this obviously I
don't spray tan my face that's why the
shade is much darker and I'm using a
foundation brush to apply even though it
does come with the cushion I just find
this way much much easier so that is
what I'm doing here and I use a lot of
Maybelline products that's just because
I have a lot recently a no reason not
sponsored this is the Too Faced Born
This Way concealer and I love love this
for under my eyes I use on my forehead
and above my Cupid's bow to highlight
and I am going in with my Beauty Blender
and I'm just blending all that out I
feel like this look that I've been doing
recently has made my skin looks so like
dewy and fresh for some reason so then
I'm going with my pure contour stick you
guys know I can never get rid of this
thing I use this every single day of my
life but I'm lightly contouring like
barely anything extreme and then I'm
just blending that out and then I'm
going in with my new favorite this is
like a strobing liquid is what it is by
Maybelline and this is shade 100 and I
put that on the back of my hand and I
use my Beauty Blender to apply it right
above my cheekbones where I'm normally
high rallying highlighting I'm sorry
English please um and then I'm going to
apply it on my forehead and above my
Cupid's bow again where I would normally
highlight
there is honestly more singing in this
video so be prepared but I am just using
my Anastacio dip brow in the shade soft
brown to fill my brows and you guys know
how this as super simple don't do
anything special and then I'm setting
them with the Anastasi a clear gel just
so they stay in place all day and then
normally I would go home with like
concealer and clean them up and be
really really nice but I'm just using
this Maybelline master precise um
concealer kind of it's just supposed to
help your brows there's a lot of
Maybelline I swear I'm not sponsored
like this is ridiculous um but then I
kind of blend it down with my finger I'm
to use it as a eyes shadow concealer and
then I am setting my face with the
Maybelline better skin powder and I'm
using this on like my chin and my
forehead not really the parts that I
want to look more dewy and highlighted
and I'm going with my Kylie cosmetics
Burgundy palette I will list the shades
I use I'm using the brown shade in my
crease just to blend it out and then I
go in with the darker shade on the very
bottom just to deepen my crease out a
little bit I change the brush I'm using
because wasn't really working but I am
just blending that out a little bit and
then I'm going to highlight it kind of
using the shade naked which is like the
lightest color and I'm putting this in
my tear duct and on my brow bone just to
make it look a little bit better again
kind of dewy I don't know what you would
call that but I love this and then I'm
using my Urban Decay Brown eyeliner and
I'm just smudging this all along my lash
line and then using my Maybelline
colossal mascara I think that's what
it's called and I'm using this on my
lashes and of course I got it in my
eyebrow because I am such a big guru
guys like I'm literally professional I
just you know look my finger and got it
out so that's what we're dealing with um
and then I'm contouring with hoola
bronzer and this is just lightly
contouring nothing special
going in with my Urban Decay kinky blush
I'm just applying this on my cheeks and
then I'm going in with highlighter by
anastasiya can we talk about the fact
that this is my spice lip liner by Mac
like okay Keaton get a new lip liner
it's almost done but I am just lining my
lips with spice by Mac I use this every
single day okay why it's so tiny and
then I'm filling that in with creme de
nude it's the shade of this lipstick and
then I am done I'm taking my hair down
and this is the finished look oh my what
a wonderful time wait a minute since I
put the bow side shut it down yeah you
