be reacting to them and I'm really
nervous because you guys don't stand how
embarrassing this is I mean that she was
just that I'm on where through the

Oh God sighs bye everyone screaming you
were ugly the like in my opinion I can
say it myself I was Liddy dot see guys
like looking at me pictures I'm like I
am NOT cute whatsoever I don't think it
was that you were ugly I think it was
that you thought you were really really
yeah I think that's the problem is I
thought I happened that is like posing
and like look trying to be really cute
because like you've got like I'm keep
which is good because she still does
she's always had that confidence I guess
oh I thought you were pretty cute
I always thought I was cute it that's it
for today's video I figured oh just do
me reacting to old pictures one because
it's like around school time and it just
makes me remember all the awkward things
I had to go through when I was in high
school and in junior high and elementary
and a lot of you guys haven't seen what
I used to look like I just know me as I
am now so when you guys smell that
there's hope that you guys can turn out
just slightly better than you can look
if you go from where you showed you guys
to go from 0 to 100 real quick it's not
going to be real quick it's going to be
about 12 years of your life but need to
make it so just I'll let you know if you
guys like having my sister in my videos
give it a thumbs up right now because
that lets me know that you guys like
these kind of videos if you guys want me
to react to anything else it might be
funny to react to like old YouTube
videos that I have private is because I
have a lot of videos that you guys never
seen that I put on private because
they're really embarrassing so ho you

thumbs up and I will
