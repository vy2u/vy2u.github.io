to be a full outfits obviously by the
title of this and I'm so excited to be
putting this up because I haven't really
made a video like this since my summer
outfits video so I'm really excited to
film this for you guys and if you guys
like this style of videos like me
filming it out somewhere else comment in
the comments down below or give this
video a like because I'm thinking about
doing one for a Christmas when it gets a
little bit colder and my outfits changed
and all that kind of stuff and they're
just really fun to film so anyway I'm
gonna get done talking let's just get
right into the video so for my first
outfit I'm wearing this really cute
sweater from brandy melville and the
dress is also from brandy melville and I
am obsessed with pairing sweaters on top
of dresses for the Fall because a lot of
my dresses I really love but they're
obviously like spaghetti straps and it
cannot wear them in the fall so I always
just pair a sweater over it and then
some booties
this entire outfit is from a brandy
melville and actually really loved this
one I took a lot of pictures for any
mobile in this so the skirt top and
everything together just looks awesome
and I love wearing skirts in the fall
which is kind of weird but I just really
like the look of it and then I also
really like jean jackets for the fall
just because they keep you warm and
they're cute so yeah love this one
so this would probably have to be my
favorite outfit it is just the boots
that make it my absolute favorite so
these are from forever 21 and then the
top is just a stripe top from Windsor
and then the jacket and shorts are both
from brandy melville I'm obsessed with
pyramids together and you can kind of
wear whatever you want since it's such a
big coat he may contain here to run away
but Kota Damansara clothes and
breezeblocks Shandra Xenophilius be me
again never kisses so do you ever stand
up also for this outfit I just wore this
black dress paired with a flannel and I
made this a little bit more edgy with
the thigh high boots again from forever
21 that I'm absolutely in love with I
want to wear them every day so I just
want to give you guys kind of a
different look so I'm really really in
love with this so this is the last
outfit and I absolutely love it and I
think my favorite part would have to be
the jeans they're flare jeans which I
I've never worn in a long time but I
absolutely love these they're from Gap
and I paired them with these heels and
then my fly looks totally unzipped here
I swear it wasn't the jacket is also
from gap and then the top is from brandy
melville I just really like the basics
of this white top green jacket black
jeans super simple and then I paired it
with some heels to kind of dress it up
some more
