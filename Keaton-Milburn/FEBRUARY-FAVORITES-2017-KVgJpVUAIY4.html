like not exaggerating seven times
because I can't get myself in focus I
wish I wish I knew how to be a youtuber
I really do what's up guys today's show
is going to be a february favorites
video and this is literally sometimes I
have so many products I'm so excited to
share with you guys and I feel like I
haven't filmed in forever because all I
do is have basically been like
pre-filmed and so now I'm like getting
back into things but anyway again I am
blonde so in case you guys know follow
me on any of my other social media what
are you doing let me just say that right
now I'll follow you on the scrim Twitter
all my stuff because you guys would know
I dyed my hair back to blonde I am no
longer purple which is sad but you know
it might come back later on in life
before you know to the video don't
forget to hit that subscribe button and
the bells we notified one I am posting
and follow me on all my social media if
you guys are interested in what I'm
doing on my day to day life and yeah
let's get into the video so the first
thing I wanna talk to you guys about are
this with liquid lipsticks I can't talk
oh my god this videos already a wreck
okay
these liquid lipsticks by make up
forever I am in love and I think that
I'm so in love this goes with all the
products in here but I think I'm still
in love because I'm more like impressed
I feel like I have like hello handers
with my makeup like I'm said yeah
doesn't work let me just throw this on
and so I got to you sent to me and I put
one of them on the other day and it
literally felt like nothing was on my
lips like it was like just the thinnest
layer but it was so like I don't know
how to describe it just felt like there
was nothing there but the color stayed
on all day like it wasn't patchy it was
just like perfect and I was like I am so
impressed by you make up forever like do
you girl like really do you so yeah
these are these changes shapes I've been
wearing the most are shape 101 which is
a very pretty nude and then shades 109
so they're really different but this one
is like a really pretty pink that I
don't know I worked in a house like wait
this is actually really nice because I
never wear pink but I love these two
chases they have so many and they have
one that can just lie still JK I'm like
so pissed about it because it's blue it
doesn't go on Christmas this one I would
sell fit I was like wow this is amazing
and the form
Islam so next makeup products I have to
talk about are the Alexis red and color
pop collection and I am also so
impressed by this not just because like
the product Sagada obviously really like
color pops anyways but I think they just
did a really really good job with like
representing her in the makeup because
this let me just talk about mangoes let
me just stop talking let me just let me
just show you okay this is the browser
and the illuminator the highlighter
whatever I hate people say illuminator a
nuisance I need not say that okay so
this is the bronzer and highlighter and
I mix them together I've been wearing
them like every single day I actually
have don't right now cuz I'm a little
bit paler for these shades but it's such
a bronze look and I feel like that's
such her she is so beachy and perfect
and bronze all the time so it really
works and then I also have one of these
call it the blotted lip I also like that
all of her packaging is matte black
which is just like come on now but come
on up so cute and it's like rose gold
ish because I don't know it's just so
pretty
anyway this is in the shade DejaVu and
it's just a really really pretty lip
color next is this by Becca de and this
is the opal highlighter and this is the
cream one so this is like a tiny one the
original one is like much bigger but I
love this Cree one because I've been
putting this on so much more I like put
this on underneath my makeup like when
I'm priming I put this all over never
Gomez forehead my nose everywhere and
then once I do my foundation I put it on
again I just feel like it gives me such
a glowy and like do we look and what I
also like about this is that I have the
opal like regular one so once I put the
cream one on I can put the opal on top
of it and it just works it's just a big
and so I love that the cream I don't
know I like cream makeup products like
that okay the next makeup product is
this by Neutrogena actually and it is
the hydro boost hydrating concealer and
I love the idea of a hydrating concealer
because again like adding so much cos
still under your under eyes and can dry
them out but I have been using this
every single day and it is so creamy I'm
honestly amazed and I don't know what I
was expecting but I love this stuff I
literally use every single day
it is in the shade white 20 and I just
apply all this underneath my eyes on my
forehead above my Cupid's bow I do all
that with this and I love it I just
loved it and it burns out so easy I
can't even describe like how previous
this and yeah I don't know it's by
Neutrogena and it is the Neutrogena
hydraboost hydrating concealer I love
okay so the last makeup products are
from I don't want to say this brands
name wrong glossy air glossy I don't
know I don't know that's it that's it
okay anyway first of all if a company
has amazing packaging it's a win for me
like it's already a hundred like you're
already up here if your packaging is
bomb like I love you so I really love
their packaging I love that it's white
and sweet and clean and cute and I love
it so it sent me actually a bunch of
products but I'm still trying to log
them out but the product so far them and
Lovelace is this priming moisturizer
which I love I love I love primers I
don't know why I have like and I have so
many timers it's a problem and the next
is this concealer this is in the shade
light 10 and I love that it's in a pot I
know that's weird because a lot of
concealers now are like in the tube but
for some reason a viscous or it just
reminds me of like old school like
concealer when you just like I don't
know if this is what I used to use all
the time and now everyone uses like a 2
but I love this and I love this consume
I love the coverage it gives me and then
the next thing is this lip it almost
looks like the container at the color
profile is in this took a little lip
color and it's in the shade cake and it
is again another nude because I don't
own any other colors leopard a lipstick
so it's not every youtuber ever so the
next thing I'm going to be showing you
guys is actually it's not font or so
before I get into this it's not
sponsored they did like send this to me
and reach out to you but they do not
probably can mention anywhere post
anywhere nothing but I just nu 'only
actually bail but with this melt like
wait let me talk about this to be guys
so this is the brain called function of
beauty and it comes in this box
and actually those function of keys on
it I'll get into that basically I would
on the website and I got to choose a
personalized shampoo and conditioner so
basically take this little quiz you tell
them what kind of care type you have so
I will
so you open the box I save the Bob
through that because again packaging is
everything to me like in your cute place
you know what I'm saying like if you're
just like trendy like it's at a if the a
plus for me it's like when you go back
to school shopping you buy all this new
school supplies and you like want to do
a haul of like your color pencils like
that's me right now it's how I feel okay
so this is the shampoo conditioner
look how cute was what how cute these
like bottle but I just think they're so
cute and I got to pick the color so
basically you go off and you tell them
what type of hair you have and so for
your shampoo you pick what you want it
to do so I have a seat it comes with a
sheet and it tells me what you picked
for it
so my profile basis does head straight
medium hair has dry hair and my goals I
wanted to have color protection
hydration strengthening Lisbon and
replenish hair and they also get to
choose a fragrance which I think it's so
cool you're literally customizing your
own shampoo and conditioner so I choose
I chose cucumber mint tonight if you
open it up and it tells you what it does
for your hair all this stuff and it
literally has your name on the bottle
because it's customized for you and I
think that that is so cute so it layers
that function of cute you guys can
really see of its functions Keaton right
there and I just love it and I got to
pick the color so I picked purple in
this little light green color and I just
think it's adorable if the pocket also
comes with this little like things to
stick it in there you can pop it out
you'll also like pour this into your
hand no no that's kind of annoying but
anyway I know I'm talking really fast
about this product but I say really love
this and I love this idea of having
customized things like I just think
anything customized it's so cute to me I
just I love it I died over so I want to
share it with you guys
also there's a link in the description
if you guys want to go check them out I
think you can save five dollars but
there's something like that it's not
like a sponsor it's not like that but I
think anyone who gets anyone who buys
one can like Vince them the link up
other people and you see if I go is I
don't really know how it works I know
you can say five dollars you click the
link down below but yeah so anyway one
so it's not realistically okay so the
last four the fifth wire it's not dice
snap okay I'm sorry it last of the
favorites to do is going to see my music
and you guys know every month I make a
playlist on Spotify this month before
are we even going to pretend what you
don't know what are we going to pretend
like you don't know what I'm about to
say because you guys know I'm about to
say you know this month and it made me
so emotional I am truly blessed like it
really like it just touched my ears like
I feel blessed with nature's music does
that make sense like that's how I feel
also I'm wearing a big Sean shirt this
is like the one that goes into like
white ombre and it's so pretty and it
says I decided on the back so yeah
anyway I'm basically a promoter for Big
Sean so go by I decided on iTunes right
now it's amazing I also have it on my
Spotify playlist you guys can go follow
me on qualify also I'm getting so
distracted I'm like athe - like how
pretty these flowers are love today okay
anyway moving on back to my playlist I
have all of Big Sean's album on here I
also have colonics - album because I'm
going to sing to it religiously it's
really been helping me like grow up you
know
then another song that I've actually
really been liking is a same dress by
chance the rapper and child's play
featuring trance the rapper I don't know
how to say the actual person's name a Z
no talking about SVA
I don't know that's how I don't know how
you say that him I don't want to mess it
up so yeah I'm most into those two songs
but I have a lot more on this place you
guys want to go follow me on my Spotify
I love when you guys treat me and say
you listening to my playlist because it
makes me really feel connected to you
