address my attire um yeah I'm wearing
this hat because one my face is really
really stubborn and I just like don't
want to put makeup over cuz just doesn't
help it just dries it out and yeah and
then I also have this like weird rash
thing under my eyes right now and it
really burns and I went to
dermatologists not mad it's important
all this stuff anyway world why I was
hat on I don't have makeup on and I
don't want you guys to like see too much
my face okay um and it's just a super
casual video I never just like don't
wear makeup in videos so I think you're
like we know each other it's okay I also
feel like I like just made a favorites
video maybe it's because like in all my
recent videos I've been like sitting
here talking to you guys but hello oh my
god cute so hard all this like
Valentine's Day decor is gonna go away
now that it's more anyways guys this is
the favorites video you know what it is
I'm gonna be showing you guys things
I've been using and loving all month so
yeah let's just get into it
so I don't have a ton of like makeup
favorites but I do have like two and so
this one is the Becca like highlighter
by Jaclyn hill and this is like all
three of them so they're so beautiful
and so I bought this a while ago and
then I kind of forgot about it whoa I
almost dropped it I almost shop it when
I didn't guys I'm not gonna drop
anything in this video not gone
this is IKEA it's an I didn't would I
forgot that I had this and then once I
started like I don't know I was going
through my makeup drawer cuz sometimes
you just get stuff and you set it down
and you don't want to use it cuz it's
brand new but then you never use it cuz
it's brand new
that's kind of what this was and so I
started using it and it basically
replaced my soft and gentle just because
I love mixing these two shades right
here it's champagne pop and pearl oh my
gosh there's so beautiful together they
make the perfect eye light so I love
this right now and then also you guys
already saw this this is the tartlet and
bloom palette and I just I don't know
since its new I've just been like going
to a more frequently
than my regular tartlet palette but I
haven't done anything too crazy with
this just been using like the neutral
colors in it I'm gonna try and use you
know some darker shades some Maroons and
stuff okay and then the next thing it's
not really makeup and it is the kiss lip
scrub by lush and I had the mint juleps
lip scrub a long time ago comment down
below if you guys watched my like blush
haul that I did like literally a year
ago it was like one of my first videos I
ever did and I did a lush haul but I got
mint juleps I think in that video I
literally have not bought any lip scrub
since I made that video and then I got
this as a gift at Valentine's Day and
it's the kiss lip scrub and it tastes so
good t6 raspberries at some of the
auditions though you can't like buy it
comes like with on cleansed and stuff
but it has like a little hearts in it
it's so cute and there's no way I'll
ever be able to finish one of these but
it really helps my lips and I use this
every day so that's all for like makeup
UV ish products um now I want is
something I never would talk about like
food but this like if I'm talking about
food in the video that means I really
freakin love it so this is the also I
love this for quite a while I just have
never like bought it and had it in my
home always have to go there and get it
and it is the Einstein brothers
developed honey almond schmear and if
you guys have ever been tying some herbs
I don't know if everywhere has it but if
you guys have ever been here oh my gosh
you have to try this it's literally just
honey almond like
no it's called schmear but whatever I'm
and I eat this on my bagels all the time
I've been eating it I know I always get
up when I go there but then my mom the
other day saw this in the store and she
was like I have to buy this for me
because I love it and I always dropped
something in a video I just want to go
one video I don't drop anything this is
the schmear go buy it okay anyway
clothing items that I've been liking and
it's weird because it's like literally
eighty degrees outside and I'm gonna
show you two jackets but the first one
is from brandy melville and this is just
like a crop sweatshirt jacket thing I
don't know it's so soft and just really
easy to wear I throw it over everything
like this I street wearing leggings and
like I just put this on over with
leggings and it's just a lot for me
right now and then the other thing now I
think about these are both brandy
melville of course but I bought this a
while ago on this one I was in New York
for beautycon I'm just been wearing it a
lot more recently and it's just a jean
jacket
it's just oversized jean jacket and I
just been wearing it because I don't
like to really dress up all the time so
like to make up my outfits look a little
better I'll wear like a t-shirt leggings
and like some nice Nikes and then throw
this jean jacket over and it's like it's
such an outfit like I don't know it's
like I'm trying but I'm not trying at
the same time which is like the story of
my life
aka like this hat like I don't really
care like about the Lakers but like if I
have this hat on and like an
off-the-shoulder thing look yeah it's
really not a look I just made that up so
that's all for that the first thing I'm
gonna talk about is I was gonna say in
music but I'll just talk to you guys
about the book I'm reading right now and
I'm reading the life-changing magic of
tidying up and so let's see who is it by
Ken it's I don't want to say her name
wrong it's like I know what it is I
don't say Marie Kondo so I was gonna say
Congress in the books
she says anyway so it's literally
basically about cleaning up I'm not
going to give you guys like a full
description of it but it's basically
like about how to organize your life and
how to clean your life like up and I
started reading it because a lot of you
guys when I asked what videos to watch
you were like oh my gosh do a room tour
and I was like I would love to do a room
tour it's my room was like clean and not
that it's dirty all the time because
it's very clean all the time but it's
cluttered and this is book basically
helps you declutter your life and so I
found it because se Button was talking
about it in one of her videos and she
was like I got rid of so much stuff
enough and so many people have read this
book and like gone to her like trainings
and stuff about how to do clutter and
like cleaned out everything and I want
to do the same thing so I'm reading this
book right now I'll let you guys know
how it goes when I start you know
organizing my life which is gonna take a
really long time because God knows
what's in my room so that's a book I'm
loving for this month and then now on to
music so I've actually liked a lot of
music this month last month I didn't
have like that many good songs but if
you guys didn't know I make a playlist
every single month on Spotify it's
January favorites member your favorites
it says everything and so I have my
playlist right here I will leave my
Spotify down below and right here you
guys can let go look me up or whatever I
have your favorites and I guess I'll
just say I'm like the top like for so
did I buy Kalani is really really good I
really loved Kalani so like every month
there's always like one Kalani song I
probably been listening to it for a long
time but then it just like comes back to
me so like did I buy Kalani and then I
also like I mean Rihanna's new album is
so good I may have talked about on my
Lobster in my last favorites video I'm
not really sure but that one is really
really good her whole album and I I
think my favorite is consideration and
consideration woo and love on the brain
and then another one that is also my
favorite my last song out of this
there's
twenty-something songs in it but I'll
name for the fourth one is something new
by zendaya featuring Chris Brown and I
mean everyone loves and day on Twitter
like I don't want everyone cuz probably
gonna be someone in the comments like I
didn't like singing it but like everyone
on Twitter is always posting how much
they love her and I love her I think her
style is so cute and she's just perfect
and she came up with a song with Chris
Brown and it's really really good and I
love it and I'm excited for don't really
see me music um so yeah that is
basically it for my favorites video I
feel like that was kind of fast but I
don't have like a ton of thing to talk
about I am working on some new videos
for you guys so I have one I'm filming
tomorrow and within like the next few
weeks I'm gonna start pre-filming a lot
of videos so I can get them up faster
