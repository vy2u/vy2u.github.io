filming a favorite for you guys because
my last favorites I just feel like I
don't know I don't know I know I just
did one but I really really like talking
you guys like on camera chillin stuff
like that I know what I'm saying the
month of februari has gone by so fast
that I'm want even comprehending that
it's like a march and I bout to have
spring break and then I'm gonna graduate
and then one would be senior and that's
really really gross so we're not gonna
talk about it but we are going to talk
about my favorites okay first and
foremost these beautiful beautiful
things right here okay so the first one
first of all I'm wearing all three of
these on my lips at this moment and i
also posted into a picture locket or
comment seemed like oh my gosh you look
so pretty why Dale across from so I want
to show you guys I watched acacia
brenly's makeup tutorial and enough
people don't like occasion but I think
that she's so so like stunning and so I
watch her makeup tutorial and she had
this little combination I think but yeah
she had this little combination and I
was like hello I need that they're like
rattle in the rounds are so the first
one I got is from urban decay it is the
24-7 glide on lip pencil in the color
also I'm a really big like packaging
corner like I keep everything in its own
package so that's why it's on this it is
in the color naked juice this is a
really like dark nude I guess and so I
use this line my lips with it also these
pencils sharpened so beautifully that
sounds really weird but like you don't
you sharpen some like lipstick spindles
and they just get messed up or they get
a little lining up that's really ugly
but these sharping like beautifully i
don't really like but and then about
this color this is in naked so this one
is naked too and this one has naked
play naked yeah this is the more
painkiller so I why night helps with the
darker and then I put the pinkish woman
in the middle you're like Phil on my
lips and then I this wasn't in her
tutorial but I really really wanted to
look lost just to like enhance their
like lip look so I got this from NARS
and it is in the color belize and it's
so pretty guys I'm like obsessed with it
also I've never really bought anything
from Norris actually you know I've never
bought anything ruin ours but this is
the first thing I bought and I'm really
really obsessed with their packaging
like I think it's beautiful so I think I
didn't go buy more things from them but
this is the lip gloss it's just a really
nice nude pink it is glossy so it like
is it sticky earthen like I don't know
normal but it goes on fabulous with the
lip pencils that i use and i would have
been wearing this like every single day
it is what i have on my lips right now i
did also just get a spray tan so it kind
of looks like nude on camera like it
looks more nude but it is the pinkish I
promised next makeup favorite is this
beautiful beautiful thing ok so this is
the two base semi-sweet chocolate bar
and yes again it is in this package
because I don't take things out of the
package and go with package way weird
this is what it looks like it guys have
never seen this it's beautiful and you
guys have no smells it smells so
wonderful so i've been using this these
are like all the colors I've been using
and I bz coconut cream peanut butter
mousse bonbon frosting and i have been
using truffled this dark eyeshadow right
here to actually like fill in my
eyebrows because i want to try it out
and it actually looks amazing and they
have licorice which is like you can use
that for eyeliner which i think looks
awesome so it's beautiful i love that
next is a BB cream IAM ok so i've never
used a BB cream i just went about this
and i bought it in the color light it's
the l'oreal magic skin beautifier BB
cream in
right for you define actions in one
Prime's corrects hydrates and perfect
flawless fair skin so I got this and I
actually really really love this I've
never used to BB cream so I did not know
they come out like white on your hand
and you run min and then like they turn
a different color I don't know they're
really freaked me out but I really love
it so I bought this because I do get
spray tans in my face is normally a lot
lighter than my body because I wash my
face more than I wash body like I atole
and everything if that makes any sense
so this works amazing to even out my
skin tone when I am kind of in the
middle of a spray tan so it's like I'm
lighter but I really have my mac
foundation is a lot darker than my
actual skin color so when I don't have a
spray tan that's like old open on my
face know about this and it works
amazing so I suggest you go try it i
think i'm going to try a different color
because i think it's still a little dark
but when I don't have spray tans even
though I got in light which I found kind
of weird but I really like this next two
things are not actually beauty products
well they're not makeup products but
they're like face you know what I'm
talking about okay so i got the what is
it even cold it's both boscia no i dont
no idea what the scope and it is the
makeup breakup cool cleansing oil so it
is a cleansing oil which I don't you
know use like foamy kind of stuff but I
really really want to try it out because
I saw a bunch of stuff so I went to the
skin ID section or whatever of a sephora
and then i was like when should i buy
this and i was like nah lets you expect
it and then because savour is always
hooking me up I'm not to check out and
they have it in the zone anyone and yes
again it's in the package awesome so
first of all keep this thing actually
that's a first of all it's like you
stick it here and then
it's so when you travel with it doesn't
like this court everywhere anyway okay
but I got this and it works so good on
my skin like guys I've never felt
anything like this I normally use my
sight sync app rakaat scrub whatever it
is st. Ives apricot scrub and this has
like chain like I don't even I barely
use anymore i use this every single day
and going to travel with this and so now
i know that i definitely need a bigger
bottle and i'm not going to go to travel
size but this is amazing it like you can
see your makeup just like coming off
when you're washing your face it just
feels amazing and afterwards your skin
is left a teeny bit oily but my skin is
really dry so i feel like i'm kind of
helping it next speaking of oily i
bought these makeup remover cleansing
pellets hydrating from Neutrogena so i'm
going to CVS because i normally use baby
wipes you guys watch good morning
routine is baby wife to take my makeup
off and then stay tuned have big legs
and so I was like whatever i'll buy
actual makeup wipes that q uses those
and so i bought these and they feel so
amazing guys and they work so well
especially with this i wash my face with
this and then if I have little X guys
like all my eyelashes or anything like
that I use this and it definitely
hydrates my face it does exactly what it
says it is so this is amazing i don't
know all i gotta say about that next
moving on to music's I've loved a lot of
music this month I don't actually I my
phone i'm not going to play it right now
first song which i did put in my
Valentines Day get ready with me you
guys want to see that it says below um
but the first one is love me like you do
by Ellie Goulding like that is my song I
probably listen to it on repeat like 20
100 billion times but I love that song
next one would be for 45 seconds that's
really confusing to say four or five
seconds by Rihanna Paul McCartney and
Kanye West and I really really like
and I absolutely love Rihanna like she's
like my goals okay and so when I heard
this song I was just like my heart and
also when I seller performance I was
like you're the best and I don't even
care if she wore that little dress I
think she looked amazing next song that
I really really love is sugar by Maroon
5 if you guys want to see the music
video it's so cute it's like he goes to
all these weddings and stuff but it's
just really cute and I think that I've
moved to New that and love me like you
do like more than anything like what
sugar comes on I'm like no one talked
I'm rolling the windows down and I'm
singing is my favorite song and then of
course I have to support ariana grande
in her bay and so they have a song
called resurgent yeah yeah it's called
research and re-recorded is in it and
it's a bell big shots ex-girlfriend i'm
pretty sure but it's a really really
good song and i actually love big sean
and i love our in grande you guys know
that and so I just like died like my
heart exploded so the next thing is
about to talk to you guys about that are
my fam through this month are random
there's no category that they fall in
some of them kind of fall in a category
but whatever i'm just gonna get started
so the first one is friend i totally
forgot to mention this last month i
think i mentioned it i don't know i
mentioned in one of my videos but i
really really love friends and i'm on
season 10 so i have finished most of it
season types of last season and i
finished most of it as like to once i
started at the beginning of january so I
watch like four episodes a day the next
thing won't talk to you guys about is
cereal okay not do you don't not the
cereal that sheet okay um actually se
but if you guys are subscribed to her
she talked about this in her favorites
video which i thought was so cool
because we have something in common
because I like love her you have a
podcast app on your iPhone if you have
an iPhone which a lot of guys do there's
a podcast app and you could go and you
feed download podcasts so this podcast
is called cereal and it follows a case
that a girl investigated and it's about
this guy who is convicted of ordering
his girlfriend it's a murder mystery
kind of thing but it's not made up it's
a real case
is she goes back and she investigates
it's after he's already been convicted
it's all this stuff in his amazing case
I listen to it while I run which sounds
kind of weird but it keeps me occupied
because when I'm running I literally
want to die so actually just finished it
like yesterday and it ended amazing so
