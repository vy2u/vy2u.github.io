a main channel video and this is not a
vlog I'm so excited to be filming and I
obviously I'm doing a makeup tutorial
today I'm doing a makeup tutorial for
the first day of school is my door open
I'm doing a makeup tutorial for the
first day of school and I was going to
do something like oh like really pretty
like roving like nice like first day
school look but then I realized like not
a lot of people have time the first day
of school obviously but people still
want to wear makeup and look nice
obviously it's the first day of school
and it's my senior year this year so I
was like I'm gonna want to do my makeup
um it's not like anything like
extravagant like I didn't like to spend
like five million hours on it but it's
subtle it's like nice makeup I guess to
me I don't know I like it so I figured I
would do this tutorial for you guys just
cuz I haven't done a makeup store in
awhile and I know a lot of you guys are
going back to school so I just figured I
would do video also my hair is like
really weird in the video because it was
wet when I started filming and then I
just let it dry so now it's like still
wet but whatever anyway I hope you guys
like the video and yeah so I'm going to
list all the makeup down below basically
I'm taking my naked liquid foundation
and I'm just stabbing it on my face with
my damp Beauty Blender and this just
blends it in really really easily I love
this and then I just blend that all in
then I'm taking my Maybelline and
concealer I'm just putting that
underneath my eyes to highlight so I'm
going to make a little triangle shapes
underneath my eyes on both sides and
then I'm also going to make a tiny one
on my forehead just to highlight my
forehead and then again on my Cupid's
bow and on my chin next for contouring
I'm going to be taking my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick and I'm just going to
be putting this lightly
in where my cheekbone would be and then
I'm going across my forehead and I'm
going to bring it back down on the side
to do the same thing and then I'm
blending that all out with a Beauty
Blender
next I'm going to set what I just did
and I'm just using the lightest shade on
my Kat Von D palette and I'm just
setting my highlight and then I'm going
to be taking a darker shade and then I'm
going to contour it kind of bronze up my
face
next I'm going in with some blush and
I'm just putting this on my cheeks and
then I'm going to be using the Mac soft
and gentle highlighter and I'm just
doing that right above where I put the
blush and I just really like the way
this looks I really can't go a day
without highlighting I don't know why
I'm so obsessed now on to my eyebrows
I'm just filling them in with a pencil
if you guys want a full routine on this
I can do one but super simple just
filling them in lightly and then I'm
going in with my benefit speed brow to
make them next I'm just finding my
eyelids for the eye shadow so I'm using
the urban decay eyeshadow like primer
potion and it's just the only thing I've
ever used so I use this right before I
put on all my hat shadow now on to
eyeshadow which is my favorite this look
is super simple but I started out by
putting on the shade mousse in my crease
and then I zoomed in a bit so you guys
can see but basically I just took a
really glittery shade and I pressed it
onto my whole entire eyelid so I did
that it's actually almost a rose gold
it's really really pretty on but it's
super simple as I said then I took the
same moon shade that I used in the
beginning for my crease and I just kind
of blended it outward so there's no
harsh lines and then I'm going to be
taking a really light like silvery color
and I'm putting that on my brow bone and
then in the corners of my eye just to
make it brighter and yes that little
speck in my eyebrow is bothering me so
much then for eyeliner I'm doing a super
thin line and I have no idea how I got
this right the first time I did it on
camera but I'm just using the Maybelline
Line stiletto and then going in with
mascara and I'm obsessed with this
mascara right now guys it's seriously
amazing it makes my eyelashes so super
long like I feel like they're fake but
it's awesome
now for the lips and sorry if this looks
kind of messy it's super hard to do in a
viewfinder but I'm just using this vise
lip liner and this is just make my lip
look a little fuller so I use this and
outline my lips and then I'm going to go
in with the urban decay naked liner and
I'm just gonna fill in all of my entire
lips and then I'll just blend that in
with my finger to make the lines not
look so separated and harsh and then to
make them all one I will take the MAC
lipstick I can't pronounce the name so
I'll list it down below but I just take
that and put it all over thank you guys
