be a full face of forever 21 makeup and
I'm just going to say I thought that I
was a genius think I was in forever 21
and I was like oh my god what if someone
did and then I looked it up on YouTube
and like a bunch of people have already
done this video so I'm really not
creative like really you try to meet me
but I'm not creative but I'm going to do
it anyway but this is a whole bag of
makeup all of the makeup that I could
find the barbecue on obviously I
couldn't find a foundation at forever 21
or like a concealer but there are like
contour powders and mascara and all that
stuff so I'm going to be showing you
guys some of the products I got from
forever 21 and I'm going to let you guys
know what they're good or not and if you
guys should actually invest in them I
feel like I look so bougie with these
hoops on right now and like my makeup is
about to be poo so I'm just going to
take these off so I don't look so
ratchet so the first thing I'm going
with is this beauty sponge that I bought
I will also put all the prices so that
you guys can know how much I spent I
just spent a total of $80 at forever 21
which honestly like $80.00 to buy me
like an eyeshadow palette at Sephora so
I don't think it's that bad for the
amount of stuff that I got because I got
no laundry stuff but I'm going on with
this and I'm also going to be using my
Maybelline dewy and smooth foundation
Suzy's fit me foundation in the shade
120 classic ivory you know when your
foundation says ivory you are so PI over
you
oh is it kidding you're not even uphill
and I'm like that's what is most of time
when I film I'm not at my lowest of lows
but it all up I forgot I bought a primer
hold on they actually sell elf cosmetics
at forever 21 and elf is actually balm
so I'm not even worried about like the
fact I bought this I'm not even that
like I actually needed some primer so
this is the elf mineral infused face
primer and I'm just going to apply this
on it I way we have fundation Europe and
on the back way
but it's fun oh this is like a clear
that looks weird I was expecting
something all the different case oh I
feel like this is like a smoothing
primer it feels like okay now I'm going
to go on with my Maybelline fit me shade
classic ivory can really see that I just
applied um this works perfectly okay the
fact that I spend like $30 on a Beauty
Blender
when this I'm pretty sure was like $2
you know I feel like I've been scammed
my whole life
this light is making me look oily uh
promise I'm not that holy
y'all chill on me I'm also just going to
go and really quickly with some
concealer this is you two Faced Born
This Way concealer and no no okay I also
bought some cosmetic brushes these were
$12 actually so where's that sheet but I
need cheaper so I'm going to set my face
with one of these brushes this is a huge
powder brush I'm going to set my face
with the Maybelline super super stay
better skin this is in shade 50 it's
definitely not my shade right now
because I'm really pale but we're going
to use it because all I really have
anything else so oh I just put this
brush um I mean this brush is really
soft it is really soft but it does kind
of feel like one of those like little
kid brushes you get when you're like
first getting makeup you know like it
doesn't really feel like it's not really
setting what I just put on okay I bought
a brow palette this was three dollars so
we are going to see how my brows look
because I'm really
I'm real picky okay this is what it
looks like comes with a tiny it's really
not that bad
I like to use a pencil Vil because I
have more control with the powder
I really can't control that much of
where it's going so that's the only
thing that's kind of annoying oh my god
Busey Oh Oh God
okay I will say that the packaging feels
very very cheap and plastic which is
understandable this was only five
dollars so they're not going to have
some Urban Decay packaging these are all
shimmery shades which is kind of a
problem for me because I do like that
change to like set everything oh my god
this litter go in with a brown shade
right here and I'll put this in the
crease maybe I'll swatch one for you
guys should I try and swatch it you
can't even see that's the swatch I got
it yeah these are not these are not very
pigmented I kind of want to try this
this one it's a really pretty shimmer
and put that Oh Oh because that's
actually pigmented oh shoot Oh God we
found one we found one people
this one is pigmented okay so doesn't
look that bad I actually have some
liquid liner this is just waterproof
liquid liner it was three dollars okay
so I applied liner actually really
really like a signer
I highly suggest this this is really
good especially I cut oh shoot
welcome to my channel I literally drop
everything okay I actually like this
liner a little bit better because it's a
smaller brush and the one I have I don't
know I mean I think it takes a little
bit longer to dry but I really like the
finer this is good I thought yes I also
got some false lashes these are so
lashes and number 53 these are like
literally some Big Daddy lashes like let
me just say I do feel very plastic me
like they don't really look that I don't
how to describe it but it feels like a
kid's toy okay these are the lashes they
actually look a lot better on camera
they are a bit dramatic and the only
thing I would say is that they're just
like really plasticky so they don't bend
like they don't really form to where you
want to put them on your either just
like a straight line you have to like
put a lot more glue than you normally
would
that's the only thing I have not applied
mascara
I've only glued them down and this one
as you can see the front part just keep
like it's just it's such a thick classic
line having a hard time sticking to the
glue but we're going to apply some
mascara now and try and blend this
together
but honestly and I can see the lashes
like in my personal visions as I was
calling all times I have to think okay
this is the mega laughs waterproof
mascara by forever 21 I don't even know
this one looks like so we're
Oh God I actually like this okay good
I'm scared because I feel like when I
apply this mascara it's going to like
ruin these lashes like they're gonna rip
off my eyeballs
I literally just like ripped all my
lashes off because it's just I let's do
the bottom the bottom is fine okay
honestly I fixed it as much as I
possibly could
that's the best I can do moving on so I
bought some contour powder and this was
for 90 and I'm going to be using their
brushes to contour my face I don't have
a cream contour and I'm really pale so I
was like you know what I'll just use the
powder and then put bronzer over it so
you guys can see it's actually doing
something like it's not bad it's really
not this brush is trash to try and
contour all I will say that like oh like
it's just hard because this brush is not
working if I was going to go somewhere
with this makeup on I would probably
just like switch to my regular brushes
but I want you guys to understand the
full effect of doing my makeup with only
forever21 and I'll probably wash this
makeup off after this video so now I'm
going to go in with the actual bronzer
this is a different bronzer palette
actually looks really pretty like the
bronzer like the design on it I'm going
to use the powder brush to bronze
yeah cuz I like this brush a lot better
it feels a lot better does what needs to
do I mean it's not necessarily doing the
best job at blending but it's working
like it works I bought this because I
thought I was really pray that this
hombre blush and this was 590 and I was
like oh my god
stop can't really tell that it's on but
it is shimmery and you can see that like
you can see a little bit more glow so
that's good because actually like I like
the shimmer of it it's actually kind of
nice
oh speaking of shimmer I have a
illuminator so a highlighter whatever
you guys want to call it it's actually
doing something like it honestly is I
don't know making it so it is only a
little bit dark but there is a highlight
there a lot of steps it's going to be
the list so this is a matte lipstick I
will tell you the shade once I open it
up this is the packaging it is clear and
you can see that inside of it I don't
know there's like not a shade number but
it just looks like this there is no lip
liner we're going to do this bottle of
lighter instead I'm using my own I'm
just gonna no God trap or not let me get
him here that's a clue
so this is a lipstick
it smells like blistex like it smells
like a chapstick so I do think this is
like seriously a chapstick that's just
like really pigmented the color I
actually really like I actually really
am into this color it does feel a little
bit dry but it doesn't feel that that it
really does it like I actually would buy
this in like a more nude more nude shade
so this is the finished look this is
what the makeup looks like actually
doesn't look too terrible it's obviously
not my full type of look that I would
want to do I wouldn't want my makeup to
look like this but I do really like the
bronzer the bronzer was really good the
eyeshadow was really iffy and the
eyebrows really fe2 the brushes I would
not recommend to anyone I don't really
think the brushes are that great I do
really like the blush the breast is
really cute the lips are really good and
the mascara is actually not that without
the lashes the mascara is not bad at all
and honestly das's was also inexpensive
I know I spent like a total of eighty
but like I said I did always at Sephora
could get you like literally nothing so
for this type of look if you're just
looking to get like real quick like an
expensive makeup like I definitely this
actually works like it's really not that
bad and this beauty blender was not bad
at all like honestly this is probably
what impressed me the most and what I'll
probably use a lot more is this beauty
with it like I'm going to probably use
this I hope you guys like this video

bit different and so makeup oriented but
