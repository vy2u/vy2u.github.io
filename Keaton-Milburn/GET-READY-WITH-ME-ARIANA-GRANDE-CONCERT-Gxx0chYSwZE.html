film this really quick get ready with me
because I did go to the ariana grande
concert and it was amazing that I know
lots of people are touring right now so
I figured I would do it get ready with
me concert styles so yeah the first
thing I did with my makeup was put on
this NYX primer I will leave all the
makeup down below I put my Mac
foundation on with my Tarte brush and
I'm obsessed with this brush I've had it
for so long
next say is my Maybelline age rewind
concealer I'm not really sure what shade
this is but I will leave it down below
it's just amazing concealer I think I'm
gonna have to go get a new one soon
if I just use this to highlight and yes
I look like a raccoon and I blended this
in with ages Real Techniques foundation
brush and the next thing I'm doing is
taking my Bobbi Brown foundation stick
and the color golden and I putting this
on where I would normally contour and
then I'm taking a Sephora flat top brush
to blend that all in and yes Jimmy was
talking me during that that is why I'm
smiling and then taking my Laura Mercier
pressed powder
I just set that all in and I am also
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and putting that on where I
highlighted next I'm taking my Tarte
bronzer and I'm just applying that to
where I also contoured and then I'm
taking my Corliss step blush by benefit
and putting that all along my cheekbones
along with some soft and gentle
highlight from Mac for eyebrows actually
decide to use an eyeshadow just to try
something different and I use the shade
truffled from the semi-sweet Too Faced
palette and I just set that with the
speed brow by benefit this is just my
go-to eyebrow look to prep for my
eyeshadow I used in Urban Decay a potion
eyeshadow primer and I'm using it the
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette for all
of these looks
so the first colors that I'm using are
truffled I put that in the crease and
then I blended it in towards the middle
with the shade mousse next I'm taking
the shade butter pecan and I'm putting
that in the inner corners of my eye and
I also put that under my brow bone just
to give some highlight and then I'm
taking my L'Oreal stiletto eyeliner and
I'm doing a really really thin line on
my eyelid and I'm taking the benefit
there
mascara is my favorite and I'm just
using this to finish off the look I'm
consuming my lips a little bit so I can
have a better look application and then
I'm taking my Urban Decay lip liner in
the color naked - and I'm lining the
bottom of my lips and the top of my lips
and yes the lip application looks so
weird on camera that I promise it came
out normal and then I'm taking the shade
naked still by Urban Decay and I'm
filling my lips in and then I'm taking
my NARS lip gloss and the color poles'
which I am obsessed with and I'm just
finishing off the look now onto hair
which is insane which you are about to
see so first I'm gonna be taking my not
your mother's dry shampoo and just
putting that all through my hair and
rubbing it in and then I'm taking a
brush and just combing it all down to
make sure it's all smooth and today I'm
using my nume curled a met which I'm
obsessed with if you guys want to check
it out I have discount codes for you
down below so you can get 40% off the
new me site plus free us shipping with
the code cup of joe and then you can get
$100 off any newly set just like this
one with the code biscotti
I really like this pearl gem set because
it gets three different barrels so I can
have a large medium and small so today
I'm using the medium size and I'm
wrapping my hair around this really
really tightly which I normally don't do
but I figured I would try something new
so I'm wrapping it and I'm leaving the
ends straight and after that you're
gonna get a really really tight curl
which I don't necessarily like but
you'll see at the end of the video and
so I'm just doing that around all of my
head and I also do have half of my hair
up in a ponytail so I like to do just
the bottom of my hair fully and then I
do the ends when I curl it in the
ponytail so if that is the completed
look for that so I'm here spraying it
and then I'm just gonna run my hands
through it just so it's not so tight and
once that's completed I'm gonna take a
brush and I'm just gonna brush all of
this out just to make sure it doesn't
look too too curly and now I'm taking it
down so I can have really really loose
waves and you'll see here
next I'm just taking the front section
of my hair and I'm doing a really really
simple braid I did it really really
tightly so I'm just gonna braid all the
way back I'm doing this on both sides
and then I'm just gonna pin it back with
a bobby pin and I'm gonna kind of push
the back of my hair up so it looks
teased and like not so flat but yeah
that's the completed hair look for my
outfit I tried to keep it super simple
so I'm just wearing this gray halter top
from brandy melville paired with my
Urban Outfitters maroon bralette and I'm
wearing my forever 21 high-rise black
jeans which I always wear and my boots
are from rag-and-bone at Nordstrom's I'm
obsessed with them then I'm just
carrying my Michael Kors dark green bag
