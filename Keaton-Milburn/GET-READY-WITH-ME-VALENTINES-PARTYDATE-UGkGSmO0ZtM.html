hey guys so first off I'm gonna be
showing you guys at this a makeup look
for Valentine's Day I'm starting off
with my Smashbox primer and then next
I'm gonna go in with my Mac Foundation
and I will leave all of the colors and
descriptions below but I'm just putting
this on a Tarte foundation brush and
removing it all around my face next I'm
going in with my Maybelline age rewind
and I'm gonna put that down my nose and
up towards my forehead just to like
highlight the top of my face so I look I
don't know glowy and then I'm
highlighting underneath my eyes next I'm
going to be taking my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick and this I'm using to
contour I know it looks weird but I'm
putting this on my cheekbones and then
I'm also gonna go in and put it on the
top of my forehead and I'm gonna put it
on my jawline I am taking a basic
foundation brush I got this I'm pretty
sure it's CBS and I'm just blending the
highlight in and then I'm gonna be
taking a flat top brush from Sephora and
I'm gonna blend that in as well
now I'm taking my laura mercier
translucent powder and I'm taking that
on a big powder brush and I'm just gonna
put that where my where I highlighted
and so that's gonna make sure it sets
and doesn't like move around and then
I'm taking a laura mercier just pressed
powder and I'm putting that in the
darker areas because I didn't want to
use my translucent on the darker areas
and then I am taking a bronzer from
Tarte and I'm just putting out in the
same places that I contoured I'm taking
my Corliss step benefit blush and I'm
putting this all over my cheeks I used
an excessive amount with this so I went
to Rosie and I'm taking my Mac
mineralize skinfinish uhm soft and
gentle and I'm using that to highlight
my face now I'm just taking my speed
brow gel from benefit as well and I'm
just putting this through my eyebrows it
make them stick and I'm taking my Urban
Decay primer potion I'm putting this all
over both of my lids next I'm gonna go
in with the Urban Decay Naked basics
palette and I'm taking a really light
color and I'm just putting this all over
it kind of sets it and then I'm taking a
virgin from the first Naked palette and
I'm putting this all over it's a really
nice shimmery pink color and then I'm
gonna go in with the light color it's in
sin and I'm taking that and putting it
in the inner corner to brighten up my
eyes and then lastly I'm taking a dark
color called toasted from The Naked
palette and I'm putting this in the
corners lastly I took the same white
color I used in the beginning and I put
it at the top right of our eyebrow bone
and then that just highlights it and so
if that is the finished eye shadow look
next I'm going in with my stiletto liner
please you don't look at my nails
they're so disgusting and I'm just doing
a really really thin line on my eyes
just because I don't really do winged
liner or anything like that and then I'm
just using my a benefit mascara to
finish this off
the next step that I like to do is
actually use a foundation brush that I
use when I blended my concealer on top
of my lips this just gives it a better
like neutral palate so when I do my lip
liner I can go right over my lip line
and then maybe if you want to extend
your lips make them look fuller this
helps as well so I'm using my dark lip
liner in the color in anticipation and
my light lip liner to color them in and
then I'm taking captive by Mac and I'm
just feeling all of my lips in with this
then I'm taking my lipgloss that I got
from pink and it is in the shade
brilliant I believe and I'm obsessed
with it so I put this on top of that
that is basically it for the makeup lips
so now we can move on to outfits the
first outfit I'm wearing I am wearing
these jeans that are from rag-and-bone
and my top is from brandy melville it's
really sheer but I paired it with a
white bra let just to top it off and
then I'm wearing these nude booties I
think they're from Nordstrom's and then
of course I have to have my hair curled
if you want to see a full hair curl
tutorial I have that listed down below
the next look is a top from Joab Brown
which I'm obsessed with it has open back
and I'm pairing it with the same jeans
and then I am also wearing the same
white bralette and I topped it off with
a really cute hat that I got from Free
People it's a really dark grey but it's
so cute the third outfit I'm wearing I
actually paired with black high-waisted
jeans these are from forever 21 and I'm
still wearing the same tan booties and
then my top is from Urban Outfitters I'm
obsessed with it I'm pretty sure I wore
at last Valentine's Day it just has
flowers on it I thought it was really
cute and then I'm wearing the same white
bra LED and I just pulled my hair up the
fourth outfit is a sweater from brandy
melville and so this one is if you live
in a warmer climate like I do so I
decided to pair it with some Didem
shorts that I got from American Eagle
and then that's basically it I also part
of my hair down the middle for this look
I hope you guys enjoyed these outfits
and the makeup tutorial I did pick more
casual outfit just because that's more
of my style
I don't really dress up super fancy so I
hope you guys
enjoyed this and I will see you guys
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
