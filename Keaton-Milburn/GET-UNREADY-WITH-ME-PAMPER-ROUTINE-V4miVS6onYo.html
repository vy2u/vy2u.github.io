Oh
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be ink it I'm writing with me and I'm
so excited for this video because I
haven't wanted to film a video like this
for so long I know you guys have been
requesting nighttime routines you guys
like watching my routine kind of videos
so I hope that you guys like this video
just to keep in mind while you're
watching this video this is not
necessarily my nighttime routine this is
just what I do when I want to relax and
I'm just getting on ready basically so
this could be when I wake up in the
morning and I know I have nothing the
rest of the day I'll just like go take a
bath and do this routine or this could
be when I've had like a super long day
and I come home and this is what I want
to do I take my makeup off and take a
bath at all that kind of stuff so just
keep that in mind when you guys are
watching the video that it's not
necessarily a nighttime routine this is
just what I like to do as my paper
routine how I like to treat myself if I
had like a rough dare I just want to
relax stuff like that without me talking
anymore let's just get into the video so
depending on what I was doing that day I
probably have some leftover makeup on so
I come straight to my restroom and I am
taking that off so I'll be using my bed
minerals cleansing oil and I just put
this all over my face this automatically
just starts like removing my makeup and
like breaking it down and then I'm using
my Luna to exfoliate all that off I've
used this since I showed it in my
skincare routine and it's honestly like
changed my life and the way I take my
makeup off then I am drying my face and
I'm going to use my Garnier micellar
water and a little I don't know what
these things are called the little
cotton bags of and I'm going to take off
any extra makeup
next it's time to run myself a bath this
is my favorite part I love baths guys
they're the absolute best so I am
turning water up extremely hot so
unnecessarily and then I'm using my
aromatherapy stress relief this is like
body wash and foam soap so I pour a ton
of this in my bath because I like having
bubbles and the smell of like the
eucalyptus mint is so good if you guys
have never had this I don't know I just
love this all of it so that creates
bubbles but while that's running I go
back I kind of wet my face a tiny bit
and then I'm going in with my new
favorite obsession this is the glam glow
youth mud mask and this is an
exfoliating treatment and this is
amazing like the feeling of this gives
my skin so I am taking this and I am
putting this all over my face just a
really thin layer and it's gonna start
like tingling like right away and that's
I know it's working it's awesome and I
really like that feeling I also like to
explain my face because I have really
really dry skin and I just think this is
amazing I just love this mouth so I am
putting that on um now I'm getting in
the bath with my mask on I will set a
timer for 10 minutes is a 10 minute mask
which is awesome so I just set my timer
and then I sing a little bit
so while I wait for my mask to dry and
just relax in the bath I normally go and
pick out a YouTube do today I chose Tana
mojo I don't know why I picked such an
awkward video for me to actually watch
in the bath I really didn't think about
it till after I'm stuck filming and I
was like why did i watch her in the
bathtub I really don't know but anyway
this is just my time to relax chill out
I just feel good and I just love the
bath so now I'm going in with my shea
moisture um this is just like
exfoliating scrub and I just do this on
my legs because as you guys know I spray
tan and I like to get all my old spray
tan off and so I like this it works
really well and it leaves my skin
feeling really soft now depending on how
I'm feeling I will maybe wash my body
maybe not today I chose to wash my body
just a little bit while I'm in the bath
I don't know I was just bored and I
wanted to do that so I'm using my dev
wash in my little yellow loofah because
it's my favorite color
I'm stupid I know but now my timer has
gone up so I'm taking my mask off I'm
just like wetting the towel and I am
wiping all of it away and the feeling I
have when this mask comes off is amazing
it was so freaking hot the bathtub was
like burning me obviously as you can see
but after that I will head to my room by
the way guys I have a bathing suit on
under this it really looks like I'm so
naked but I will grab pajamas or
something comfortable for me to lounge
around and so thanks to Helen for this
little pajama set this is from Urban
Outfitters it is from the out from under
line which is like my favorite pajama
set ever so I'll go change into that
so once I am all change into my little
set I'll come back in my room grab my
phone real quick and then I head right
back into the restroom so I am pulling
my hair up only because I just really
hate having my hair down all the time
like I don't know it just bothers me so
I'm pulling my hair up and then I'm just
using my aquaphor and putting a little
bit of chopstick on because I feel like
my skin is so dry and my lips are so dry
and I just need to moisturize so that's
what I'm doing and then I am heading
back into my room so depending on what
time the day was it actually looks
really dark but it really wasn't like
nighttime out at this point but normally
when I just want to like get ready and
like relax I'll put my phone on the
charger I'll grab my laptop and this is
where I like really just chill so I go
through my subscription box and I just
see what videos I want to watch normally
after I'm done watching YouTube videos
or whatever I will call Hallie and we
literally FaceTime for probably like two
hours maybe longer every single day
probably longer but I will normally just
sit on FaceTime with her for like the
longest time ever I promise I'm actually
on FaceTime with her I just didn't show
her on camera I'm not faking it but yeah
so I'll do that and then if it's night
time I will go to sleep and if it's just
the middle today I'll probably take a
nap after all this thank you guys so
much for watching this video I hope you
guys liked it if you liked it give it a
thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to

will probably be filming down and
putting that up around the time that I
actually do move I hope you guys like
