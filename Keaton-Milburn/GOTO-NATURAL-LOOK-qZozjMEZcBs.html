obviously going to be a makeup tutorial
and I'm so excited about putting this up
for you guys because I have partnered
with Clinique for this look so cleaning
has come out with a bunch of different
pop colors and this is their pop lip
lacquers and I chose the one that is
wink pop I believe it is it's so pretty
it's seriously a gorgeous like nude pink
and I really really actually love this
tutorial and like what I'm about to show
you guys because I feel like a lot of
times people do makeup tutorials and
different things like that they feel
like if they're gonna watch a makeup
tutorial or do their makeup everyday it
has to be some like glamorous look and I
really love this because it's a natural
like bear look so it looks very natural
not to like cakey and all you don't have
to do it's not hard to do it's just very
natural and pretty and so I absolutely
love it so if you guys want to see how
Clinique use the makeup and their music
video I will have it linked down below
along with all the makeup that I use in
this video I hope you guys love this
tutorial subscribe if you have not
already for more videos like this and
give it a thumbs up also let me know
what you guys think about the look and
go check out clinics channel so yeah
let's just get into the video so first
I'm going in with my Moisture Surge
intense and I'm just putting this on my
face to moisturize and it just creates a
good layer before I put all my makeup on
so then I'm going in with my line
smoothing concealer and I will list all
the shades and everything down below but
I'm just covering up any blemishes on my
chin underneath my eyes kind of in my
forehead and then I'm blending that out
comedic winter so then I'm going on with
the clinic beyond perfecting foundation
and I love how this applies because I
just put it wherever I want and so I
don't like waste a lot of foundation
like pouring it on my head and then
putting on my face so I'm just putting
this out this I'm gonna brush all over
and then also to make it look like a
little bit more seamless
I'm taking my Beauty Blender and I'm
just gonna like put that all over it
have it all over my face just to make it
look perfect which I absolutely think
this looks flawless just the way it is
but I'm also going to go back in with
the concealer and I'm going to put that
underneath my eyes on my forehead and
you know all the basic places you put
your concealer and then I'm going to be
blending it out with a beautiful here so
after I'm done with that I'm going to go
in with the chubby contour stick and
this is the best shade ever it looks
really dark but I promise it works
perfect so I'm not doing a really dark
contour for this look just because like
I'm making it look a little more natural
so just like all my cheekbones and not
even all the way up my forehead just
halfway up so I'm doing that and then
I'm going to blend it out with a Beauty
Blender so once I'm done with that to
set my under eyes I'm going in with the
like this is a matte pressed powder by
Clinique and this is I think an
invisible map so I love this shade and I
I'm going to put it all over my face by
also focusing it underneath my eyes so
you know highlighting brighten it up and
then I'm going in with my bronzer and
this is just going to go on my
cheekbones where I just contoured and
then down my neck all the other places
where the Sun would normally hit to make
me look bronzed
then I'm going in with this blush and
this is a new cheek pop blush and I
absolutely love this shade I think it
goes really perfect with this looks it
give just like a natural flush to my
cheeks and it really really helps bring
the lip color that I'm going to be doing
I'm in with the rest of the look so I'm
just applying that to my cheeks and then
I'm going in to my eyebrows so I'm
combing my eyebrows out and then I'm
going in with the line pencil this I
absolutely love having use a brow pencil
and so long and I love the way this
applies because it's a really thin
pencil so it helps really straight my
eyebrows out and it doesn't look super
fake so for the eyeshadow I'm going in
with the first shade number one and I'm
putting that all over the lid just like
set and Crime and then I'm going to go
in with the shade number three and this
is going to be like the crease color so
this is going to deepen it up not doing
anything dramatic super crazy with this
but I'm just going to blend those out
and blend them together and then I'm
going in with this vanilla pump um color
and this is just like a light shimmery
color and I'm putting this on the center
of the lid on the inner corner and this
is going to make a good car trap to do
the crease color that I use and then the
center and then I'm going in with the
shade number three again I'm putting
that under near my eyes and then I'm
going to go in with a cleaning
high-impact mascara so this I'm putting
on top and bottom lashes I didn't do
eyeliner for this look because I just
felt like the eye shadow and stuff looks
a lot better without it so
and lastly I am just lining my lips with
the Clinique lip liner and this is the
perfect nude pink shade it's also really
really good for over lining your lips
over drawing the lip starts called
because it's such a natural pink color
so I really like the way this looks so
I'm just winding my lips and then I'm
going to fill all of it in and then I'm
going in with unique lip pop lucker and
this is in weak pop and I absolutely
love this so I'm going over top of my
lip liner and I just feel like this ties
the whole look together it's a very
natural very simple color it's not too
bold but it's not too like bland so I
just love it and that is the final look
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video

inspired this whole look so I hope you
