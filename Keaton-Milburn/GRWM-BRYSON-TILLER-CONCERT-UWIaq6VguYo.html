left is Thalia all bare when I told us
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be a get ready with me Bryson tiller
competition if you guys know me you guys
know I literally live breathe eat well
okay I don't eat right and tiller but I
live and breathe by the tiller hey I
want to see my outfit whatever through
my hair and all things like that I'm
vlogging the concert I will leave it all
link down below guys so call me mister
you're on that kind of thing but I just
wanted to film getting ready with you
guys you guys near ready we can go to
the concert together it's going to be a
blast just keep watching
I love I've been drinking this coffee
for like four hours I don't know what so
I'm setting off with my bare minerals
combo control milky phase primer and I
just recently got this and actually
really really loved it and I always want
to use like a regular primer which this
one is so sticky like if that makes
sense
it's like tacky but it helps me like
ensure that my makeup is going to stay
on especially for concerts I always get
like really and like just gross
and I want to make up to stay on all day
now I'm going with the flash illuminator
by the Escalade edit which is like I say
water I showed you guys this in my back
of school video if you guys haven't seen
my back to school makeup tutorial one
and I actually think it's a really good
tutorial for back to school and it's
just really good tutorial in general but
if that isn't enough to watch it I'm
also doing a giveaway so if you guys
want to go check out my back to school
video don't forget to go do that I'll
leave a little ball right here but like
go watch it after you're done watching
this video because that's cheating
if you skip video so we're going to do
we're going to try out the it cosmetics
CC cream in tan first which this CC
cream guys is legitimately everything to
me like I'm not kidding if you guys are
looking for go CC cream it cosmetics
well like it is so good it's actually
full covers it gets not sheer C secret
like it it's pretty bomb oh my gosh this
actually matches pretty good
see it's Lourdes same exact color as my
next you guys are always asking what
self-tanner I use and most of time I go
get sprayed like at a salon so I never
mention it because it's like depending
on where I live which you guys are going
to be shocked by the self-tanner I use I
used a self-tanner mousse by Tarte
cosmetics so they sent me a mint and
like this tanning mousse and I use it
today for the first time like all over
my body and it is so good like I'm
legitimately so tan all over it's not
streaky it's not orange
it's literally exactly like what my
spray tan normally are so I feel like
that's going to be really good for like
when I get a spray tan and my spray tan
starts to fade it's going to be really
pretty to just like touch up my tan I'm
going in with my Too Faced Born This Way
concealer in the shade fair I really
wanted to film this get ready with me
especially for this concert because if
you guys know me you guys know I am
obsessed with Bryson tiller like it's
not a new thing like I've loved him for
like probably like two three years now
and I am so excited because when he came
on tour for trop soul I didn't get to go
because I was out of town so now I'm
finally getting to go to a concert and
I'm legitimately so excited I'm going my
friend Sheila but I just really want the
film to get ready with me because I was
like who wants they all ready for a
concert by themselves not me so filming
this is legitimately like getting right
with my friends like hey guys we're all
going to the concert together
I'm also vlogging it so if you guys
actually don't want to see the concert
and like what I wear and all that kind
of stuff you guys should go look at my
vlog Channel because the video will be
up I'm going to contour them using the
pure cameo contour stick and this is in
the shade tan and basically like this
the opening act for Bryson tiller is a
girl named like her her name is her and
I am so obsessed with her she has two
albums out right now it's volume 1 and
volume 2 I put them in like all of my
drive with me and I am so obsessed other
so when I found out she was opening act
for Taylor I literally
lost my mind I think I'm almost more
excited to see her than I am to see
Bryson tiller again I'm contouring my
child for legitimately no reason like
this just it does nothing it blends into
literally nothing maybe it helps if my
it might help a little bit but I am
baking my face because one I boxed in my
eyeshadow and I know I'm going to have
fallout and I need to wipe away my bacon
in my fallout into I get so sweaty at
concerts like I legitimately get like
oily and sweaty and every single time I
bake my face it's like not a single foot
spa so make sense so like a month ago
I made a playlist on my Spotify and it's
called true because like that's you know
like what Bryce Miller says so I have
her I have both of her albums on here
and I also have truffle and tillers new
albums for yourself on here and it's
just like a mixture of songs that I like
on both of them and I just have been
consistently listening them in
preparation for the concert because it
just makes me so excited so I'm gonna
put on shuffle this is like oh oh my
gosh
do you ever hear a song after a breakup
and you listen to the lyrics and you're
like oh my gosh
this is probably how my ex feels this is
probably like how they feel for me like
it's like a good song but you're like oh
I know this is what they feel this song
I literally was like this is probably on
my XP okay
I am so petty so imprison me oh here it
is where my I found it today for some
reason I'm feeling like a like black
smoky eye I don't know why I just feel
like that is the mood that I'm going to
go for today so I'm taking this sweet
peach palette and I'm going to set my
eyelid with the white peach just any
white shade you guys like so much
clothes and our two guys can like see
all my introductions of sign online so
I'm going to take this color puree this
isn't a sweet peach shallot and I'm
going to start by putting this in the
crease if you guys know this song right
here by Bryson tiller you're really an
OG this is it so now to go along with
like more orange shades like I said so
this is summer young as you can see
right here it's like super orange and I
can't when to smoke this out but I kind
of want it like on the top I'm trying
not to cover my whole lid in these as
you can see it's like I want it more
towards my brow bone I don't want to
Center it on the lightest in the crease
and above
okay so now in the glitter palette this
two-faced glitter palette I really like
that this is like B perfect black
pigment honestly I use any eyeshadow
that has a matte black that I just like
this one so that's I'm going into this
or you can honestly if you don't want to
do like full-on black eyeshadow you can
do a really like dark brown and it still
looks really pretty but basically I'm
just going to take it on this brush and
I'm going to start by putting it on the
lid
super close to my lash line and then I'm
just like smoking it out now I'm taking
the Sephora Pro featherweight to create
Reza's number 38 and there's nothing on
this but I just want to kind of blend
these two lines together because I want
it to look like the flock is like going
into the orange that makes sense I like
the way that that look so now I'm going
to take the shade nectar which is just a
really pretty highlight shade I'm going
to highlight my brow bone right there
and I'm also going to put a little bit
in the inner corner over so now that
that's done I'm going to start to like
wipe away the baking that I guess so
underneath eyes I'm being really careful
because there is like black eyeshadow
from fallout and you don't want to like
smear the black eyeshadow you want to
just like you gently now I'm going to do
the under eyes so I'm taking the black
eyeshadow from a glitter palette and I
am NOT going to do a lot because I don't
want it to look too messy but I'm just
going right underneath and I don't go aw
like that i shadow my action I don't go
all the way to the inner corner I only
go half way so I'll only smoke out the
lower lash line halfway now I'm going in
with some mascara this is the Givenchy
whatever you want to call it mascara and
actually really really like this I just
want to make a really black mascara
because you know make must make my eye
shadow look smoky I really should put
fake lashes on I normally do for
concerts well I'm just so lazy and
I always end up ripping them off now for
contouring I'm going in with the bare
minerals bare Pro contour and this is
actually really really pretty Oh super
impressed and I got this in the mail so
these shades one and two I am just going
to be taking on this v for contour brush
number 79 and I let I just mix those two
and I just lightly contour I always
confer my face like slightly and then I
just go over it with bronzer just to
make sure it's not like a harsh line now
I'm going in with the Too Faced dirt
chocolate Soleil so I do have that
Soleil bronzer but I use the dark
chocolate one which is pretty dark and
that is because I am a little bit darker
now but this is still pigment you guys I
literally like do this once or twice I
tap it off and then its Bryson tiller
sings in check
I'll pray for me tonight because I might
not make it home
I might just literally die a shelter I
might just pass out dead I'm going in
with the Papa don't peach blush that's
because I'm not trying to do some bright
blush tonight I want to be a little more
subtle so I'm going in really simple
blush and then I'm also going to go over
top of it with my Becca cosmetics
highlighter and champagne dream launches
Bellini and this is just a pink
highlighter and that's just because I'm
extra and I want my cheeks to have
highlight as well
oh my god I so just all dudes are salty
I'm not even a concert yet okay so for
lips i'm using this colourpop lip pencil
and Kirby I believe oh I don't want to
do anything super crazy with a lips just
because the eyes are already like so
dark I don't need a dark lipstick so I'm
going into this makeup forever
let's pick in 103 it's a matte liquid
lip and I haven't used this in a while
but I missed it I miss my baby I forgot
how much I like this lip color it's such
a perfect nude like with this lip liner
it's just a really perfect nude I forgot
that I loved I'm back on this again and
I'm back into it I honestly haven't
decided a hair or outfit look that I'm
going for tonight so if you ever want to
see what I end up wearing and how I end
up doing my hair and that kind of thing
I am going to be vlogging the concert if
you guys get on my blog but I'm also
obviously going to post in serum picture
while I'm at the concert so I wanna go
follow me on instagram you guys will see
Jaz else s what I end up wearing you

gonna wear a hoodie but anyway don't
