turn we're gonna look at AC yeah we need
an artist positive but anyway what is
you don't have time to talk I don't know

wait no time I don't know why I like sat
around was editing and did like nuts and
we FaceTime your mom today we're seeing
Eminem we're saying Amina we're seeing
cardi B mu goes wells I really like a
man's jaw occupants joy or a single
budget before they actually graphical
good performances today all I have to
say is that Beyonce and changed my life
yesterday without a doubt like I oh my
god is like I've never been more in love
with someone like you my whole life and
I wasn't yonce like I wasn't also
Halle self Kourtney Kardashian and nudes
there were a voice oh I don't know I
really like my outfit Berta I keep
saying nah no I really like today's
outfit so I really hope this makeup
doesn't like screw me because I think
guys if your makeup doesn't look good
it's like they're all so oh I just
realized I kind of want to do my
eyeshadow before because I'm doing black
eye shadow
yeah I feel like this is one of my
favorite outfits obviously there's not
somebody silly one of my favorites like
what I mean but it's also the outfit I
really need to be skinny and s'more and
I'm just a 3-time like but the reason
we're rushing is because we're getting
on the dope bus and it leaves at 1:30
and it's literally 12:30 right now so
yeah yeah so like be on time and look at
my like face right now with this white
he's out Georgia well we stopped Georgia
and it looked oh my god she was so good
guys like she was so amazing also we saw
post Malone yesterday and he was so
drunk on States and a yodeling boy
didn't perform with him which is really
really dissertation guys I really wanted
to see the orderly boy like in real life
yeah
Plus mom was so drunk that they started
like just playing the tracks like crazy
over him singing and he was just walking
onstage I know like literally like I
don't even know what he was saying cuz
he was like so drunk it was kind of
annoying I'm just he did sing some songs
post Malone brought out 21 savage though
and it was so good like I loved 21 I'm
really excited for cardi B today because
I wonder if she's gonna like bring out
like you know it's like offset like I
really like I hope so
it's like she's just the one like she's
gonna be doing something crazy
I just can't wait to see her in the
flesh like he knows what she's gonna
like say and I feel like no I know she's
like I feel like this year she's
relatively like she's come on like a lot
I feel like it's like oh she's acting
like yeah like she's at her peak right
now so it was really cool to see her and
course anyway he's like yeah
hey regnant like she's already gotta be
pregnant you know that that's like so
cool also like this like an unpopular
opinion or group I know you agree with
me kinda though I am really excited
hopefully to see like Sun I've been I
don't like that gets iconic and I'm just
so stoked because think Eminem is like I
just feel like later in life evident oh
gee like we saw Eminem in concert at
Coachella so I want to know which one of
these get ready with me you like the
most because I asked you guys that last
year on the last day which get ready
with me as your favorite I think it's
two and I've really always liked day - I
love day to you or anything what day -
is always the best
it's always about like oh I think I did
this last year I did this like exactly

stomach is so full like I feel like I'm
like I feel food right here like I'm
gonna throw my guys how I just choked
her to death I'm not I'm actually not

waiting a year to get this orange
chicken at Coachella and it wasn't there
yesterday and we look arrival real air

time you certainly what I look like I
want to be like why people like these
video so much yeah I also want to know
like why do people look why do you
