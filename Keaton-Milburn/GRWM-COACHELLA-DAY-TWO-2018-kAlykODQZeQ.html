I'm ready I'm wearing a wig so I wanted
to just like braid my hair and have it
away um also I'm very well aware that my
hands are this color my spray tan is
messed up suppose I'd kept it off like a
good 24 hours and never watch it we're
really oh god I'm not going to show that
again we have snacks I have some swedish
fish I'm sorry if I'm eating well wait
who knew post rust on the elbow baby for
a second I do
hmm don't grab a coward it kind of hurts
I just Gleek yesterday we weren't
feeling ourselves you could tell that we
were just look not in a good mood so
yeah yesterday I said I had no lip
colors I still don't I went to Walgreens
this morning and bought a lot of colors
from L'Oreal so we're gonna see how
those work with my lips today I bought
like lip liners and lipsticks because I
was like oh my god what do I do
I just feel like I see people now
Coachella and they have like t-shirts
and shorts and I'm like mm-hmm
they look so cute and they don't I don't
know if they try hard but try hard yeah
and I wonder they're trying and then
like I hate it so yeah I'm just like why
do we put in so much effort I don't
really miss my outfit yesterday actually
see if I'm like tried that hard that was
Coachella yesterday though sizzle was
really good we stayed for the weekend
but we were so dead we were there oh my
god she was
crowd and she looks over and she was
laughing on me and I was like dying
laughing cuz she didn't even know she
was already just like my eyes were
closed just dumb you're so loud and my
eyes were closed I'm like also we got
back to our hotel at like 2:40 in the
morning
I lost my debit card I lost my whole
wallet like everything in sight so I
went to Coachella with no wallet no ID
no nothing like all I had was like
myself and she was already buying me
everything and so I had to go to
Coachella was nothing and then we got in
my car after which I'll like to add and
my bus ride we had to take the bus ride
home it was a witch's worth ever no yeah
I was like 45 minutes long and then we
got in the car and then we came all the
way to the hotel
I feel like VIP is 100% the way to go I
don't redeem company celebrities in my
life we'd never been a VIP before until
this year because we just didn't really
know last year in their first year and
we were just like oh whatever I like we
won't spend the money but we wanted to
do VIP so much more worth it because
like wow like it was just shaded there
was so much cushion say like kitchen
seats in there they have like good food
it's like good viewing area for the
concert like the main stage no lines for
the bathroom no lines for the restroom
it's just like super chill and there's
so many like I've never celebrities and
Larry's like there's a lot of
influencers like there was like a lot of
youtubers and stuff you know like david
dobrik and his whole crew and then Holly
I cannot wait to tell them about your
story like it's all greatest-ever a wait
Linda wait no we need a prep no no no
let me just preface this Holly had been
talking about them before this happened
she's like oh my god like they're going
to weekend wine like we get there and
Hallie it was lost how long were you
lost her first of all I did not look
really why albumen fix myself and I wish
I wasn't so ugly head in the story cuz
but I was so hungry and I have such a
headache and I was like oh my gosh I'm
so hungry of lol blah and it was
daylight outside when I said this it was
like bright outside and my friends were
there everyone was sitting in the field
it was a bareback I'm gonna go get food
because I'm so hungry and thirsty I have
to commit a sin it
not think it would take long and kayo
was coming up and I was really excited
but whatever so I went and it took me
I'm not kidding you like empowered an
hour and a half guys and I went back
like within the hour and I like went to
look for that but they were looking for
me at that point cause it had taken so
yeah take her so long we thought she was
like dead somewhere we literally were
walking around the whole venue like
where did she go in and obviously like
the smart choice is to do not break up
with anybody like I shouldn't have bet
on myself because like I should know but
it was pitch black when I went to go
search for them again because it took so
long and I was I start I literally cried
because I was just so looking at Katella
50,000 people and I was like I'm by
myself we have no service like I'm not
gonna be with any of my friends like I
have to go back by myself future where
I'm talking about and what to talk about
is the ace family and I don't get like
super excited over influencers like I
like them all but I would never like go
up today I'm or like say anything
because we're all just they're like how
me not yeah I don't like trying to be
like hi hi and so I just don't really
care but for whatever reason the ace
family is like they're just like Oh Abel
you yeah really love them and so
standing in line by her so by myself we
ran out of wasps for food I was seeing
like their long story short I end up
being like he came I confront of me and
I was getting going for a milli don't
care also like I don't say this I was
just like I don't care I got lost I'm by
myself I'm depressed I was like I was
like actually like I watch your videos
like I'm like no way me like hug me and
we stood in line together and we talked
and you guys if you watch thin which I'm
sure everyone does clay blew up so that
everyone knew that he's probably like
just like he is in his videos he's the
nicest person I've ever liked he's so
nice he hugged me he was like so sweet
and then we got to the front like we
were talking about like his baby and
everything and we got to the front and
he was like I have to pay for her like
and he paid for my dinner and so with
the Asus family got me dinner
isn't that so well like she got lost her
an hour to happen was super depressed
and then she got in line she only people
she want to see all of Coachella was a
family and then they bought her dinner

people here didn't realize like beau the
deed was just like walking around you

like right in front of us like being so
cute and I was just like looking at them
like wow Bueller's really I feel like JB

excited to see her tonight I feel like
she's gonna bring out someone you don't
watch that I feel it you know it's gonna
bring out a guest no for sure
