Holly knows but your eyes thank your for
forever while I curled my hair so that's
why to film it but I will like try and
link the curler that I got down below
because it's like this big but we're
just going to get ready good news or our
pimples or shrink your pimples are
getting smaller I think the Sun is like
diminishing them honestly I think that's
not happening but we're going to work
with it so yesterday all the people we
saw with I received first of all we were
so excited to see Mac Miller he sounds
like kind of disappointing like I still
love him and like he sounded good and
you say on to go ahead and songs that
weren't like the gym yeah he's played a
lot of like his new stuff which is
awesome I understand you're gonna play
new stuff but you didn't play like a
single old song which I thought was kind
of weird because it was like no one
really knew what was going on so that
was kind of different
and then we saw Travis Scott at the end
of the night and it was so so good
I would love Travis gosh honestly the
love of my life
so she was really really good we were
literally as the Mac Miller concert and
this girl moves through the crowd her
and like for her friends and they stand
directly in front of Holly and they're
like squishing her and I was like just
could I understand that people need to
be like squished but whenever I know
that like it was like no it was just
like we were on each other but I was a
lot of room there was a lot of room
before yeah but she just came over and
ruined it for us anyway we were already
annoyed with her to start with drew like
why would you stand here as hairs all
around and then she reaches back to get
something out of her backpack and she
elbowed me in the face literally it up
like just literally elbows me to think
and I was like no oh I don't have a lot
of magic
oh no it doesn't happen again oh I
learned like no I'm not doing this today
and I poured three other like this kind
of wrist down arrow through but it is
rude but we have a interface or like
dump a dream ball your honor
headquarters like oh no because you in
for so long that she was just like she
was there the whole time shoving us and
being super of nine she elbow right and
this yellow her in the face and then
didn't say anything about even though
she knows that she hit somebody I'm not
I'm saying like you knew you hit me but
you didn't you didn't acknowledge it so
I'm going to pour this coffee on you
again this is so I did and then she like
turned around and look I mean she was
like did you spill your drink and I was
like yeah yeah I was like yeah we're
going does that is yeah oh I got my
fault cause she thought that like I
accidentally did that it was not
accident I meant to put that on human
beings like it's fine

go over hugs but yeah I'm sorry you're
gonna have to hiss transformation
