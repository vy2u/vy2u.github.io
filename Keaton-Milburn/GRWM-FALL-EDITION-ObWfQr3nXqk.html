to be a check you're ready with the
fall edition so I feel like I'm probably
going to do more fall looks this is just
the first one that I wanted to do so if
you guys like this look please give it a
big thumbs up also shout out to cone air
I'm gonna be showing you guys how I get
this amazing hair look with this amazing
curler like when you guys see how I use
this you guys are gonna be like I am so
excited to show you guys how I did my
hair and my makeup and everything I love
fall so much so if you guys want to see
how I got this look then just keep on
watching
I look so Brown right now like literally
my face is so dark i Larry just got
sprayed yesterday so that's why it looks
a little crazy but we're gonna make a
bond and fix all that but first we're
going to do hair so today I'm gonna be
doing my hair with the Conair infinity
Pro this is the curl secret 2.0 I've
never seen a product like this so I was
kind of nervous to use it but like once
you use it and get the hang of it and it
is so easy to curl your hair like it
literally gets so simple so I'm gonna be
showing you guys how I'm using the
affinity pro con hair curl C group 2.0
and I am so excited to use it today so
let me just show you okay so this is
what it looks like when you guys get it
I will obviously be showing you how to
use it so it comes with a little like
styling God and how to use it but that's
what you guys have to me for I'm just
going to show you a easy way to use it
so this is it I'm gonna plug it in right
now and I'm going to show you the two
attachments that come with it okay so
what also comes with the glove but you
literally don't even need a glove like
that's what's really awesome about this
is that you won't burn yourself because
normally when I use a wand to curl my in
to curl my hand to cut my hair I burned
my hand like I literally burn my hand
every single time i curl my hair so this
is awesome because I will never burn my
hand because I'm not touching this ever
I just clamp this down so there are two
attachments this is one on 1/4 inch so
that's this one and then the one I have
on is the one and there's three
different settings that you guys can do
so I put it on high you can put it on
low I put on high I probably should put
on low because why not should I put on
low
family love today so you click how long
you want your curl to be like curl hang
basically so there is 12 to 14 seconds
there's 10 to 12 and then there's eight
to ten so I normally do the 10 to 12
because I want looser curls like I said
if I leave it in there longer obviously
same concept as a one you hold it on the
lawn longer it's gonna be tighter do it
a little shorter it's going to be looser
and then here you can select which way
you're running their culture girls with
right left or there's a which is
automatic I just normally do automatic
it's easiest for me so yeah I love this
heat up and I'm going to brush my hair
out I'm going to just section off my
hair in half I don't do like multiple
layers I just do two layers when I'm
curling my hair so I'm just section off
it says on this attachment it says this
side towards the head this side is
always going to be towards your head no
matter what it has that on there for
like a specific reason so make sure you
look at that when you're changing
attachments out that this side is always
gonna be towards fat so I'm going to
take a small section you could see right
here that there's like a little slot
basically that you can put your hair in
you can see it right there so because I
need to turn this words bed once you
place your hair into the barrel you're
just going to simply clamp down so it'll
do one beep and then it will beep again
when it starts beeping a lot that's when
you know to take it out
and look see it's curled and it's like
the perfect curl that I want I like to
curl like my aunt I don't like to do big
spiral curls so it's just the perfect
curl and I literally didn't do anything
I literally stuck it in health care and
job but just did that girl on the 10 to
12 seconds I am going to do it on the 12
to 14 seconds now so again I'm gonna
place the barrel here clamp down here it
goes so this is the 10 to 14 curl now
I'm going to the second layer I normally
just like to separate all the curls and
I throw them at the back of my head and
then I keep all of my straight hair in
the front just so I don't like recrawl
any pieces because I'm doing smaller
pieces on the top of my head I'm
actually going to be 10 to 12 second one
I've been doing 8 to 10 for my whole
head but now I'm going to switch it to
the 10 to 12 seconds cuz I want it for a
little bit longer also once your hair is
in there it's not stuck in there I can
easily just start releasing this so even
if you want it there for like five
seconds you can still do that as well
you don't have to leave it in there the
whole time you can easily just like let
go so I wanted to give you guys a bit
more of a close-up so I again I'm using
the one inch barrel if you guys want to
do bigger curls you can use the one and
1/4 inch which i think is also really
pretty but because I want them to last a
long time I'm doing small ones and then
I just brush them out but if you guys
are ever worried about your hair being
like stuck in it or anything like that
it's not going to be the curler actually
has an anti tangle feature in it so it
will release your hair have you put too
much in or the wrong way or anything so
it's super simple and I absolutely love
it so I just want to give you guys a
little bit more but close-up so you guys
can see the curls and how it works
finished curling my whole head I haven't
brushed anything out yet so it's a
little curly but the good thing is is
that like these curls will say so long
like they'll say the rest of the week if
I don't want a shower if you guys want
it I'll link it down below you guys can
all go buy it I highly see
just seriously like it gets my hair so
big and perfect it gets literally the
exact cross I would do if I had a wand
it's just so much simpler anyways guys I
will link it down below and just get
onto the makeup so I've been using the
Mac prep and prime skin at base visage I
don't even know they send us me and I
love it I don't even know what it does
for my skin but it makes my skin feel so
amazing and then you guys know me I
always need a glowy primer so I'm using
the itard brighterdayz primer and this
is just literally like straight the
litter and I just put a little bit of my
hand
and I put it on to give me some some
glow underneath my foundation so I don't
look so dry foundation I've been using
since it came out is the Too Faced peach
perfect comfort matte foundation I have
literally put every single person I know
like on this foundation is so good like
you guys just have to get it to
understand like my roommates
I gave like every one of my sorority I
get that shade like literally everyone
who lives with me I'm like please take
this foundation it's so good I'm using
the shade sand today we all know your
girl was a Boompa in the Alaska Treve
with me and I am NOT trying to do that
today I feel like I haven't talked to
you guys in so long
like I talked to you guys on Twitter and
stuff they haven't filmed like but
should check it ready with me and so
long it's like I missed you guys
presents and like I cannot wait to
upload this because it's just gonna be
like you guys and me sheeeit chatting
away are gonna go on with the
appointment spit concealer this is in
the shade figure and I don't know why
but every single one of these I get
breaks oh I have this big pimple on my
chin and it has literally been just like
talking crap to me all day in the mirror
like every single time I look at it I'm
just like can you know I like I need you
to vanish well I'm going with the pur
cosmetics cameo contour stick in the
Shaytan said on Twitter I am so sorry I
didn't freakin upload a September music
of the month
I've just been so busy and then I went
to the San Francisco for fall break and
I just really wanted to film an outfits
video this month and I so I feel like
that's kind of what like consumed me I
was like so focused on that I didn't
have time to fill my music of the month
but October's it's gonna be so good
because I already have so many songs in
my playlist that I love and October is
like yeah so we've got time I know I use
a lot of to face but that's because that
is the most products that I have my new
her so now I'm going in with the beach
perfect um setting powder by Too Faced
it smells so delicious
I could just cry what's your favorite
thing about fall I think my favorite
thing about fall because right now it's
not really fall but I love lighting fall
candles I I'm so obsessed with Bath Body
Works candles I mean everyone is but
like the marshmallow on everyone knows
is the best candle but I think my
favorite thing about fall is just like
lighting fall candles and like drinking
hot chocolate and just like laying in
bed watching Netflix by myself because
single but I still love fall so it's
fine we're fine okay so now I'm using
the Euler brow pomade in the shade
blonde I got this a long time ago in the
mail and I ran out of my Anastasio and
I've been using this and I absolutely
absolutely love it I've never used
anything else from Euler but I really
really like it oh here she goes
never going to do my eyeshadow so I'm
using the tartlet toasted palette so you
guys know I was like a huge fan of the
in blue and then the one before that was
like the plain like purple but this
palette is so perfect and they released
this at such a good time because it is
the perfect fall palette like look at
these warm tones like oh my gosh and you
guys know me all I do is like wear warm
tone makeup so this is like my life I'm
gonna go in with latte right here it's
like a light brown transition color I'm
just gonna be putting this lightly and
the Croesus is just gonna like start off
the look I really really like this
orange e shape but I want to like focus
it more it's like a I don't know just
the top of my lips I'm gonna take that
it's called warm I'm gonna take it and
put it more towards the top of that
shadow that I just played so it's kind
of like going towards the brows this
shade reminds me of peanut butter by Too
Faced it's like in the sweet palette but
this one is a little bit more rich which
I kind of like so I'm gonna start
putting fire side lightly in the crease
and then I'm gonna do the air corner
because I kind of need a transition in
the middle I'm gonna take the color cozy
right here in between the dark and light
and I'm gonna put that right above I'm
gonna blend all those colors together
I'm gonna go in with cozy in the darkest
one again tap it off and
I feel like I really like sunset up here
so I'm gonna take a little bit of sunset
tap it off and I'm gonna place it on the
center off the lid and then for my
highlight I'm going to just take this
shade candle and I'm gonna do my brow
bone like I normally do and I'm gonna do
my inner for my scare I'm going back
with him old mascara this is Maybelline
push-up mascara it's like the bright
purple tube and I really does it really
separates my lashes so for bronzer i'm
going in with epidemis Sun I don't know
how to say it I saw a video warning
Elizabeth that's us at different with it
I was saying it so then I was like am i
stupid or like what am i doing but we're
gonna use this to kind of contour a
little bit for blush I'm going in with
this NYX plus this blush this is away we
go and I think it's really pretty for
fall just because the color felt like
deep dark but also has some light ones
so I'm gonna put this just on the apples
of money my cheeks for highlight I'm
using my favorite thing ever this is the
candy Johnson I want candies she did
with Too Faced and it smells so good
it's a candy Luminizer so I just put the
little stick up like this and I take my
Beauty Blender and I put it on the top
and then like look oh pretty I just
really like this because it's like not a
powdered highlight but it looks so good
normally if they're like cream my lights
are kind of hard to build up but this is
the perfect natural glow put a lot of
highlighter
it looks like my like just a to go guys
but we'll cover that up so I went to Mac
the name for the first time in a long
time I bought a lip liner so I bought
morning and coffee which I bought this
cuz a lot of people talked about it it's
just like a deeper I think it's really
really pretty for fall she said deeper
darker brown but it has like a hint of
red I really need to like fix this but
it's fine we're fine I think one of my
favorite fall lip colors is Dolce K and
this is so old and this was like the
first lip color or Kylie ever came out
with but I feel like it's the first time
I ever consistently started wearing like
a more brown liquid lip so I'm gonna go
with this today just because I think
it'll look really pretty paired with the
morning coffee lip liner so we're just
gonna do this Center I don't ever really
apply like a full lip of liquid lipstick
anymore I'll just do the center and then
I just like blot it out this is the
final look I hope you guys liked this
