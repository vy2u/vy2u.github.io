but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be a festival get ready with me I'm
so excited to be filming this video
because Coachella is coming up there's
so many other festivals going on too so
I'm so excited to be sharing this with
you this video is sponsored by sexy hair
so thank you so much a sexy hair for
helping me create this awesome glitter
like bun look it looks amazing and I
can't watch out you guys so but that'll
be talking any more let's get into the
video so for this look I wanted to keep
that I shot a really pretty but simple
because I am wearing color so I'm
starting off by putting a bright yellow
shade in my crease and I'm just gonna
blend this all the way up I'm going for
like a really Sun study type of look so
I really pack in the yellow so that it
shows through when I put the orange
shade on top of it so I can make it look
a little bit more seamless so now I'm
gonna go in with the orange shade and
this is a more precise blending brush so
that I can get it really in the crease
I'm still gonna put this kind of all
over the lid but more focus in the
crease so that it blends really really
well with the yellow just so it gives it
a little bit more color and then I'm
gonna go in with a darker brown shade so
I do kind of a halo eye but like not
really because I'm not that skilled so I
do just a dark brown shade in the crease
and on the inner corner and then I'm
just blending it all together so they
all go really really nicely and then for
my like fake halo eye basically I'm
taking just a shimmery shade any
shimmery shade if you wanted to match
your outfit you could definitely go in
with like a blue glitter shade on the
inner corner or something like that I
just went in with a white shimmer shade
and I did it on the center of the lid on
my eyebrows in my inner corner and to
add a little bit of color I took a navy
shade to bring out the blue in the dress
that I'm wearing and bring it out in my
eyes and I just put it on the lower lash
line so now I'm gonna line my eyes with
my black liquid liner and this is just
so that I can apply my false lashes and
they'll fit perfectly I tried to put
false lashes on that were so big you
guys will see in a second and they
just were horrendous and did not work so
I'm applying mascara and then I'm going
in with my false lashes I thought these
were about to be like so bomb and the
lashes were probably three sizes bigger
did my eyeball so you'll see me put them
on right here and it's just tragic after
I realized these were five sizes too big
I went back in with just a different
pair of lashes that are way better they
still work perfectly they give my eyes
enough of a dramatic effect but not that
much so now for the hair I am taking my
hair down parting it in the middle you
guys could part it whichever way you
would normally part your hair and then
I'm going in with the fun sexy hair
mermaid glow getter gel so this is
amazing I applied this all in my roots
the applicator for this is also so easy
to use I'm so happy that this has a
brush applicator because if you have to
use this with your hands and put it in
your hair it would just be a mess and
glitter would be everywhere you guys
probably know takes forever to get
glitter out but this is so easy it
washes out super quick and I also feel
like this is a really good option if you
guys don't want to dye your hair for any
festivals or do anything too dramatic
like me because I definitely don't want
to dye my hair but I want to really
spice up my look at festivals like
Coachella so after I applied this to my
roots you guys can add as much or as
little as you want but after I put this
to my roots I separated my hair off
because I kind of wanted like an up down
up - up down kind of look I'm not sure
what that's called so I just twisted my
hair around and made a little tiny bun
on the top of my head I'm just gonna
take a bobby pin and pin it because
super easy super simple at least my hair
is on my way and then I want it to add a
little bit more glitter because I don't
know who doesn't want more glitter in
there so I took more of the fun sexy
hair mermaid glow get her glitter gel
and I added a lot more of it into my
roots and I just made it look a little
bit more sparkly so this is the final
look I absolutely love it I love the way
it looks so that is how you get my
mermaid festival air
that is it for this video if you guys
liked it don't forget to give a big
thumbs up and thank you again to sexy
