guys so today's video is obviously going
to be a get ready with me and I just
wanted to do this cuz I absolutely love
the makeup look I've been doing and a
lot of you guys have been requesting it
so let's just get right into it so to
start off I already put moisturizer on
my face and I'm just spraying my face
with this Oreo but it's go I think
that's what it's called I'm not sure how
to pronounce it I'm just regulus on my
face to prime it kind of and then I'm
just kind of like banding my face so
that it's so good and i can start doing
my makeup next i'm going in with my nyx
concealer and this is my absolute
favorite so I'm just dabbing it on my
fingertip and I'm putting it and all
like the little blemishes that I kind of
want to cover up so that's under my nose
where I've redness on my cheek there's
like a few little publishes I just want
to cover up and I'm going in with my
Beauty Blender and I'm gonna blend that
all out so that it doesn't just like
stick to my face then I'm going in with
my favorite new foundation I have never
shown this to you guys and I'm also
taking my lumi like illuminator kind of
thing and i'm putting just a little bit
of the movie on the back of my hand and
then I'm putting my Maybelline
foundation on the back of my hand
I'm just gonna mix them together with my
foundation brush and then I'm gonna
blend that all over my face I'm starting
with my neck first because it's a lot
harder to match my neck on my face if I
do have spray tans but I'm just gonna
bring that all over my face and I put
the lumi in just to give it a kind of
glowy look it's a very gold shimmer so I
love the way it looks with this
foundation then for my highlight I'm
obviously taking you may believe and
rewind and I'm putting this in a
triangle shape underneath my eyes I'm
also gonna put it on my forehead and on
my Cupid's bow just to give it a little
bit more highlight of that I'm taking my
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna pull
in that fall out
then for my contour I'm taking my pure
like contour stick which I'm showing you
guys a lot of new products I haven't but
I'm putting them in the same places so
I'm putting this over my cheek bone up
towards my forehead just to give it that
contour look and then also on my jaw
line and then obviously I'm letting that
all out with a Beauty Blender I take a
lot of time and flipping my contour out
because it is such a darker shade than
my actual skin color so I want to make
sure that our no line so I'm doing that
all on my cheek bones at my job then
going in with my Kat Von D shade and
light palette I'm taking the middle
shade on the top to just set my under
eye concealer just so I give it a
highlighted look and then I'm going in
on the bottom left and it is a grey or
tone so I just put this on the contour
that's closest to my ear I don't bring
it down because I don't want like the
grayer tone to make it look muddy so I
just put that there and then I'm going
to go in with my hoola bronzer and this
is just a much more like bronzy shade
and so I'm putting this all over my
temples on my cheeks where I already
contoured and I'm also going to fix it
with a little bit of when global blow by
back so I'm kind of dipping my bronzer
brush in global glow and then I'm
putting it with the bronzer and then I
just kind of mix it
moving on to blush I'm using this Tarte
blush I'm not sure the name I'm gonna
list all the makeup obviously down below
but I'm just taking this I'm putting it
on the apples of my cheeks like you
wouldn't regularly do any blush I really
love the color of this it's really light
not too much then I'm going in with my
favorite soft and gentle Mac highlighter
and I'm just using my finger to apply
this because I really like a good
highlight so I put my figure in it and I
just kind of obviously as you can see
put it right on the top of my cheekbones
I drove that
I didn't show on camera but I did use a
fan brush II kind of blended it out or
so going into my eyebrows I'm using it
associate stuff brown shade and I
obviously you can kind of tell by this
I'm just lightly filling them and I
don't want to overdo my eyebrows I just
don't like the way it looks so I'm just
feeling in the middle more and not
really the thread just like the ends in
the middle to give it a little bit more
structure and that is all too primed for
my eyeshadow I'm using the Urban Decay
primer potion I didn't show up but I'm
just rubbing this in with my finger all
over my eyelid and then I'm going to go
in with my chocolate bar palette and I'm
just taking the coconut cream shade and
I am covering my entire eyelid I always
use this shade to kind of set for what I
want to put in different colors so I'm
just putting that all over the lid then
from the turlet palette I'm taking the
lightest brown shade and I'm just
putting this in the crease of my eye so
we've a blending brush and I'm just
gonna blend that out really really
evenly on both eyes and then I'm gonna
go back in with a little bit of a darker
brown shade and I'm gonna focus it more
on the outer crease and not kind of
bring it towards inner corner of my eye
that makes sense not really a smokey eye
but just like a little bit more
definition then from the naked smoky
palette I'm taking the shade of radar
and this is just like a dark brown
shimmery color and I'm putting this over
top of where I put the darker brown
shade of the crease so I'm putting it on
the crease and also on the outer edge
I'm not bringing it towards the center
of my eye because I'm going to apply a
lighter color there but I'm just
bringing that in so then I'm gonna go in
with the chocolate bar palette and I am
going to take this con shade and this is
like - every white kind of shade and I'm
going to put that on the inner corner
and blend it out - it's the middle so
I'm gonna blend radar and Cohn together
I always do my eyeliner off-camera but
I'm using the master precise
liquid liner by Maybelline and then I'm
going in with mascara which the dip
in my eyelashes the left one has mascara
and the right one doesn't it is crazy
the roller lash mascara is the best and
then I'm taking chapstick and I'm just
prepping my lips for lip liner and with
a lipstick so I'm just putting the
vaseline or something on my lips and I'm
going in with spice by Mac so I'm just
going to lightly right outside of my
lips and this is just like exactly what
I do for this all of you guys today I'm
always over lining them but I promise
I'm not even over lining them it's just
the way this lip liner looks is the best
to make your lips look a lot fuller once
I blend my little lighter and I'm going
to be taking my Anastasio liquid
lipstick and this is in the shade pure
Hollywood and you guys have been asking
me what looks like I've been wearing in
my vlogs and all that and this is the
shade guys it is so so pretty especially
for the winter it's not too dark it's
the perfect nudey pink so I absolutely
love this and I have to supply this all
over my lips now moving on to hair this
is so simple guys I'm just taking the
hair out of the ponytail and this is my
natural hair it's kind of wild it's
pretty straight just gets tangled easily
so I am brushing it out and making sure
it's all smooth and then I'm going in
with my garner like texture tease so
this stuff is amazing I just spray it in
my roots I've spray it like and the
parts of my hair that I kind of want to
be lifted a bit more and I want to have
more texture but when I'm going to put
it up so I'm spraying that on my roots
and kind of like running my hands
through it now moving on to my hair I'm
just taking the very top section like
not even right above my ear just a
little bit higher and I'm gonna take a
ponytail and start to make a bun so I'm
gonna make one loop and then I'm gonna
messily just put the rest in the rest of
the bun so you want to this as messy as
possible so that I doesn't look like a
little ballerina but on top of your head
unless you want that and then I try to
make it look a little bit Messier right
to evening front pieces out
so this is the final hair and makeup
look and then I'm going to move on to my
outfit for my outfit I actually didn't
keep it like super warm because it is
actually 80 degrees when I'm filming
this of course in Texas but I'm just
wearing this Urban Outfitters parka kind
of thing it's like tan and then I also
paired it with a scarf slash shirt from
Urban Outfitters
it actually opened on the sides but you
can't really tell that it's just a scarf
or not a shirt and then I'm just wearing
black high-rise jeans and my normal
duties I always wear and then my purse
is from forever 21
thank you guys so much for watching this
is officially at my last video of 2015 I
hope you guys liked it and I will see
