season because I have so many holiday
videos I'm so excited to put up so thank
you again so much for watching and let's
get into the tutorial so I'm using my
makeup forever foundation stick and I
just apply this all over my face and
then I am buffing it out with a just
like a foundation brush and I really
love the coverage at this gives I don't
know why I know it looks really dark but
I promise I fix the lighting later in
the video so I don't look weird now but
then I'm going on with concealer and I'm
just doing little triangles underneath
my eye my forehead and my Cupid's bow
and then I am blending that out with a
Beauty Blender and then I'm also
just gonna pop my beautiful under all
over my face just to make sure that the
foundation and like everything is really
sticking and then to set that I'm using
some powder on a big fluffy brush and I
am just setting my whole face with that
moving on to brows I'm just quickly
filling these end with a Nastasia dip
brow super simple and easy and I can't
wait to change your lighting a changes
right here okay going in with the modern
renaissance pas i'm using these two like
brownish shades just as like a
transition so i'm blending those out and
then in my crease i'm going to oh yeah i
take a darker shade right here sorry I'm
getting ahead of myself
take a darker shade I'm putting this
kind of all over the lid and in the
crease to give more definition and then
with my Sephora crease brush I'm going
in with a dark brown I'm putting that in
the crease and then blending it in and
then I'm going in with this antique
brown color I'm also using a Sephora
small shadow brush to just apply this
all the lid and it's really shimmery so
that's what I love and I'm using the
same Sephora brush to put this light
color to highlight my brows right above
my eyebrow and also on the inner corner
of my lid next I'm going in with my
Sephora collection retractable
waterproof eyeliner and matte black I
did this off-camera but I'm using the
other end to kind of smudge it out
adjusted a really like thin line of
eyeliner and then I'm going in with my
Sephora collection core lashes and
astonish which oh my gosh obsessed with
lashes I love these and then sebelum
them together I'm going with my support
collection flash craft mascara and this
is amazing I just I love lashes now I
feel like I want to wear them everyday
and then I'm contouring with my support
contour brush I'll leave everything
linked down below and then I'm also
gonna use this brush to do kind of like
on my forehead and just bronze my face
up a little bit more since I'm pretty
pale right now next I'm going in with
some urban decay blush in the shade
kinky and I love this color and my new
favorite blush brush oh my gosh I'm
obsessed and then I'm going to highlight
my face and this is probably my favorite
part of my face routine I just I just
love highlighting if this is not the
most satisfying feeling but anyway going
up my Anasazi aglow kit and back glow
and wheezing those two shades as you
tell mix them together and I just love
the way it looks then I'm going in with
my spore collection cream lip stain in
black berry sorbet I mean like I said I
have never gotten so many compliments on
a lip color in my life but when I wore
this I was like oh my gosh this is the
best also it applies so easy and it
stays on all day like seriously it does
not come off
I ate hot cheetos and it was just like
chillin okay
so now I'm using my Sephora beauty
amplifier spray just to set the rest of
my face as you can see I sprayed a lot
on my face but that's just cuz I'm
scared it'll fall off so yeah that is
the completed look also if you're
recreating any of these looks don't
forget to use the hash tag Beauty
uncomplicated and hashtag support
