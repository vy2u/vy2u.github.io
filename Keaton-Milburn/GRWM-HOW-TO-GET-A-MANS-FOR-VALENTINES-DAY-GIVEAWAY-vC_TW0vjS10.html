but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be a tutorial so I know the tire is a
little bit funny but I really wanted to
show you guys three makeup looks that I
would do if I were going on a date on
today I'm not going on a date sometime
today but if I was this may be what I
would do it's also just super super fun
to create looks for Valentine's Day I
just love it I feel like it's fun to get
dressed up anyway go take pictures with
your friends things like that so if you
guys want to see three different looks
you guys can get around times in just
keep watching I'm also going to have a
giveaway at the end of this video so
don't fast forward watch the whole video
but I am going to be doing a giveaway so
you guys can enter that at the end of
the video so yeah let's just get right
into it so my face routine is going to
be the same for all three makeup looks
the only thing that's going to change is
my eyes and my lips so to start off I'm
going to be using the Tarte color
correcting palette I'm gonna just be
using the green shit I think I bought
the brush that comes with it so that's
what this is and I have just like little
blemishes that I like to cover up so I
just like to put the green on before I
put anything else on because I feel like
it really helps like diminish the
redness cuz I don't know it just does so
I literally put green all over my face
looks insane when I do this number going
with these Smashbox photo finish primer
I'm gonna put this on my t-zone and
around my nose next I'm going in with my
glam glow glow starter in the shade of
pearl gold this is the lightest glow
that they have and I absolutely love it
so I'm just gonna
lastly for primers I'm using the
Maybelline master strobing liquid in the
shape 200 I haven't used this in a while
but I like a rediscovered it in my jaw
and I love it this one is a super
coppery shade I like so excessive in the
way that I prime and highlight my face
underneath but it really if you guys
don't already have this foundation and
you guys buy it just for Valentine's Day
100% you should this is the best
foundation I know I talked about in my
last video but especially for
Valentine's Day this is gonna make you
look glowy you really gonna pull
somebody with this I'm not joking it is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation and oh my gosh it changes my
skin I'm in the shade six but that's
what this break in so just keep that in
mind I put too much foundation on the
back of my hand and I'm trying to like
not wasted so I'm just I'm going in with
my naked skin weightless coverage
concealer and the shade fair I feel like
I used to get like so salty but on and
say because it was like I would see
everyone's Instagram pictures and like I
would see all their stuff and I would be
like I don't know if you guys would
really like each other or you guys are
just doing this because it's Valentine's
Day I like either way not my place but
it's like sometimes if you like girls
for skies or guys for girls to like do
something on her and say that they
wouldn't normally do anyway so it's just
weird if you like social media just
makes Valentine's Day like 20,000 times
worse for like everybody it just doesn't
make any sense like me and my ex I've
learned I posted with him on Valentine's
Day and we broke up two days later so
it's like some of these people are just
like us now I'm gonna go in and contour
with my pure cameo contour stick and tan
honestly they're like on deposit for now
I feel like everyone makes valentines
day it's so much worse it's really not
bad I feel like I since I've been single
for the pastor Valentine's Days use it
as a day to like just be like oh love
you mom love you friends like I just use
that as a day to like tell everyone that
I love them instead of like sharing it
with like a significant other that I
don't have like I know that's like okay
girl some people actually get really
really sad about Valentine's Day I mean
I could care less if I'm single I'm like
one day of the year or not I'm singing
all year round like why on one day am I
gonna be sad about it like if you
actually are like really sad one either
like I do this makeup tutorial and like
get you a man's you need to just like
text your mom based on your mom your dad
your sister your brother your roommate
whatever and just be like I love you and
just be like like make it a date for
that for your friends for your family
how about you spend a night with your
girlfriend and like make some cookies or
something watch 50 shades which I've
never seen a single 50 shades before
never a single one so I don't really
know if they're like that go back well
it's like oh my god I'm gonna go see the
new one amount and say at I'm spinning
mine maybe you can do that I never seen
one before though so I don't know also
let me tell y'all right now you are not
baking your under-eyes you're not gonna
pull anybody because no one must be
looking deep into your eyes trying to
finesse you and you guys some unset
under eye wrinkles it is just not cute
so don't need to set your under eyes set
your chin set your forehead because you
don't want to be oily you want to be
looking pristine Vanessa Bowl
so for this first look because I'm doing
the red lip I'm just gonna be doing very
very minimal eye shadow like when you
see this you're gonna be like what but I
don't really do eye shadow when I do a
red lip because I like to focus on just
a red lip and a very very simple face so
I'm going in with these subculture
palette by anastasiya and I'm gonna be
taking a really big fluffy brush and I'm
gonna use this shade dawn right here
it's like a neutral brown shade so this
is gonna still give me like dimension
when I set my eyelid but it's not
anything crazy it's just a go light
brown it's almost like literally the
shade of my skin but I'm gonna take the
shade cube right here it's just a really
pretty white it also has like somewhat
of a pink shade in it like I don't know
if you'll be able to see on camera it's
like pinky iridescent I don't even know
I should not be highlighting my brows
because lord knows oh god I hate when my
lips are crusty next up because I want
to do false lashes I'm gonna go in with
the Clinique liquid eyeliner and this is
just black liquid liner I love this I
learned by the way when I do a little
better I always use this one but I'm
just gonna tight line my eyes
now port bronzer and contouring I'm
going in with the este edit by Estee
Lauder bronzer and de Barras bravas and
light/medium I haven't used this in a
long time but it's super like pretty and
natural and glow it's just everything
I'm going on with the morphe palette I
wish I knew the names on these but I'm
just gonna take this color right here
dub dub lightly because now I'm gonna go
into my backup palette you guys know the
process already and I'm gonna go into
this copper cheeks like this blush just
like a subtle like hey I'm trying to get
some free dinner tonight
would you do it for Valentine's Day I
need some food best thing if you get the
mess with this makeup just for one day
of the year just for Valentine's Day
you're gonna be eaten good you could get
you some food that's what this vibe
that's what this video should be titled
how to get you a free dinner these
highlighters have been my favorite
they're in the new color pop they're
called legit 8f this one is in the shade
spoon they're the super shock cheek
whatever I love these I've been using
these highlighters every single day
since they got sent to me just a little
little fan brush in there and when you
see how pretty they are on like they're
very um glittery is the only thing I'm
normally used to like a very finely
milled highlighter if that makes sense
these are very very like glitter like
you could see like chunks but like then
again I'm all about the highlight so I
don't really mind it I'm trying to show
you guys I thought that this body seemed
hopefully YouTube isn't allowed me was
be so cute for Valentine's Day it's from
princess Polly I posted on my Instagram
and you guys for commenting so if you're
wondering this body students from
princess Polly yet you cannot see their
way I got covers I am so excited for
this of color so I'm going in first with
the NYX glide on lip color in the color
and knock'em red it's like the perfect
lip liner to go with the red lip I have
because the red lip I have is not like
your everyday it's more like corley you
guys will see
but I'm going in with the Alexis red and
color pop collection this is in the
shade little weapon and this is an
amazing lip color like it's such a cool
red it's very very different than the
marriage okay by Kylie cosmetics which
is what I used to use us like my go-to
red lip I love this one and to finish it
off I'm going in with the touch of
luminous dewy skin miss this is amazing
makes my skin look Bob and it smells
really good but I'm almost out of it
okay so I fixed my hair because it was
super ratchet but some different hoops
said but I feel like this is the final
look I absolutely love it I really
really love the lip color and I feel
like just very very simple eyes and
glowy skin makes it look so much better
so this is the first look for my
Valentine's Day video I changed and took
a little lunch break so
for this eyeshadow look I'm just gonna
keep it super simple unlike brown and
pretty just something really really
natural but like also like okay I know
how to do my eyeshadow I'm going to be
using the Too Faced Peach palette for
this so first I'm gonna set my eyes with
the shade white peach just to make sure
it's all primed looking good also yes I
am doing this already with my fake
lashes on so talk about a skill I'm
taking my Sigma e30 8 brush and I'm
gonna go in with the color summer YUM I
love this color if you guys have watched
my videos for a while you know I did
this makeup look all the time because
it's just really pretty and natural but
it also like adds a little bit more so
I'm just gonna focus this in the crease
so now that my crease is a little bit
more defined and I have a more like
coppery orange tone up there I'm gonna
be taking this color and it's charmed
I'm sure it's just a light brown and I'm
gonna put this all over the lid to
deepen my eye shadow up and make it just
like a little bit more like nighttime
wear lastly I'm gonna be taking these
shades cobbler which is like a very
copper looking shape and I'm also going
to mix it with caramelise which is a
brown so those two colors together are
really pretty and they're shimmery so
I'm just gonna put them on the center of
the lid so for the lips I'm going to be
using this from colour-pop this is the
ultra satin lip in the shade catching
feelings and I'm also going to be
pairing it with a lip gloss this is the
very new lip gloss era both by color pop
and I'm going to start to line my lips
with the makeup forever and the shade
number yeah this is number 13
this is a second look I feel like it's
much more curly the first one which
looks very like simple classic look this
one's a little bit more curly the eye
shadows darker and I actually love this
gloss paired with the lipstick it's just
that's it for this look this is sort of
me on Valentine's Day
for this last look I'm going to be doing
a smokey eye just a darker smokey eye
actually I'm so excited to do this look
because I've been wanting to do it for a
while I had to conceal my lips because
they were getting super red and
irritated so so that they don't bother
me I'm gonna do my lips first for this
look because I just hate looking at my
lips right now I'm taking my Mac spice
lip liner and I'm just going to over
line my lips cuz that's how you that's
how you real a man y'all next up I'm
taking my Kylie cosmetics lipstick in
the shade this is a very very nude color
like I literally can't wear this if I
don't miss breaking because it's so much
of my skin color so I just put it in the
center I also just decided that I want
to gloss over it so I'm going in with
the Maybelline vivid hot lacquer in the
shade unreal
this formula of lip gloss or like lip
lacquer whatever is one of my favorites
if not my favorite it is so pigmented
and it doesn't get sticky it's perfect
if you guys haven't tried it I would
definitely try the Maybelline lip
lacquer it is awesome I'm going to be
taking my Too Faced glitter palette and
I love using this black shade right here
it's just perfect it's opaque it's just
a really good black shade
next up I'm going to be putting a
pigment on top of it this is the NYX
pigment is in the shade number four it's
a really really pretty almost army green
color it's so it's like a different it's
a smoky eye but then you add color with
it and I think it just looks a little
bit different it draws more attention
especially after out if you have blue
eyes I feel like this looks super cool
and it really brings out your eye color
so this is the third and final look I
hope you guys have liked all three of
these looks if you guys did comment down
below which one is your favorite one two
or three I feel like one was probably my
favorite but I also really really loved
this one I love the green don't forget
to comment below and now let's get into
the giveaway so now that you guys have
endured this entire video I know of me
just annoying you and complaining about
Valentine's Day I love doing this
giveaway every year and I feel like I
started it way when I first read red
shield because I felt like I wanted to
give back to you guys and I feel like
Valentine's Day is such a cool way to do
that because like I said it's a day to
not just like love your significant
other but just love like the people
around you and the people in your life
and you guys are in my life so I
absolutely love doing giveaways on bail
that day I always like to preface this
giveaway just by saying it's nothing
that's like extraordinary I'm not giving
you guys a freaking like drone and all
this crazy stuff but I love giving you
guys just a little something that you
guys can open up on Valentine's Day and
feel loved and know that I care about
you so I will be choosing two winners I
did that last year and I'm pretty sure I
did that like the year before but I'm
just going to be showing you guys what's
in this box so everything is essentially
the same in both boxes for the two when
there's the only thing that's different
is the eyeshadow palette so for the
first thing that I'm going to show you
guys in one box I'm going to be giving
you guys the Smashbox shadow and contour
blush palette this is amazing it's like
a huge palette of just a bunch of really
pretty neutral shadows and it has
blushes in it and also has contour
shades there's so much you can do with
this palette so I put this in there and
then in the other box I'm giving you
guys a new color pop eyeshadow pout this
is the go to the state of mind shadow
palette it is gorgeous it has so many
beautiful shimmer shades by here I
absolutely love this palette I think
this is so pretty so this is the other
eye shadow help you guys waiting in a
second box so the eye shadow palettes
are different but everything else is the
exact same first thing
show you guys is this little makeup bag
so in here I have stocked at full of
different makeup that you guys would
like first thing is this glam glow
clearing treatment mask this is my
favorite glam glow mask and I feel like
I want to put this in there cuz I'm
Valentine's Day you guys could just lay
down at the end of the night on
Valentine's Day I'm watching movie with
yourself do masks
if you have two significant other put
the mask on him they love it guys like
it I put some hair ties in here I also
put a new priming spray in here this one

but they smell amazing they are awesome
and then I also have these liquid
highlighter glow drops these are so so
pigmented next up I have one of my
favorite make it better primers in here
I also have a bunch of lip colors that I
added in here from Smashbox
I did three different lip colors and I
want you guys to have much options
Valentine's Day so I did all of these a
lot of them are from flower beauty if I
drew barrymore I have a Smashbox lip
color and here I also added liners with
those I added three of these eyeshadows
by Smashbox these are amazing this that
means so many of them so I gave you guys
different ones for different looks so
this one is more like ma vie and pink
and then this one is very very neutral
it has no shimmers in it and then this
one is neutral but it does have shimmers
in it so if you like these are so easy
to create a bunch of different looks
with so I added those in there and then
in case you guys want to treat yourself
and you guys have certain makeup I
really wanted to buy the Giorgio Armani
foundation and put it in here but I
don't know who I'm giving this to so I
don't know what shade they're gonna be
so I left a gift card for you guys in
here and you guys can use it to buy
whatever you want don't have to buy that
foundation you can buy whatever you want
with it but I left that in there for you
so that's what's in this makeup bag and
then the last few things are just things
that I thought were cute that you guys
might want to use so I added these hydro
gel eye mask buy buy bags these are
amazing there you put them right
underneath your eyes and they like
freshen up your under eyes so much I use
them all the time like I absolutely love
these and they're pomegranate they're
amazing and then I added in another
vitalizing mask this one is the rose
mess it's from Urban Outfitters it says
I'm a real on it and it is amazing if
you guys have never tried a sheet mask
oh my gosh it's so good so I gave you
guys a lot of things to like treat
yourself with on Valentine's Day or any
day you guys want to use it
and then I saw this this is a light box

like three in my room so it just lets
