going to be getting ready to go get
coffee when I'm wearing playlist shirt
so like we're going to playlist yes I
literally already did this going to do
right away from when I was into jela and
our checkout time was like early we did
check out I'm doing that again our
checkout time is 11:11 away we need to
stop doing now but I just don't know my
checkout time till the day before let's
see what with your same men in mine we
went to okay with the new go first
channel when we went up on the DJ booth
oh my gosh yeah I'll put some snaps of
that we learn at the playlist parties
and we toured were dead set on getting
up to go on till a society J booth no
one was up there just like the DJ cuz we
semester with anything finesse or
whether we finished our way to the top
guys we wanted it president as soon as
we got in the party we were like we want
to be we want to get up there like how
we got there and then we just made eye
contact with the DJ yeah when I was like
you - yeah yeah when we got it
we thought they're going to be like
steps or something no we have to climb
up like a lot of real lavender as well
so it's going to be like my little you
like walk up there and go like a giant
ladder we're in snow animal is sketchy
but we made it work because we wanted to
DJ yeah that was a good I was always
like universe we went to Universal VI
universe yesterday but felt sick though
I was so sick we've been eating like
gross and like to play let's play the
thing like everyone gets to take after
playlist it's just like what happens and
I have everyone got it last year but I
feel like it's coming from you this year
mind's eye documented because of my
pellets will sales of the week before my
prom
oh yeah event a prom for the prom day we
get rendered me I was like yeah I'm sick
it suppose plague I remember that yeah
Lee cuz I was like I didn't even get
sick yeah I was so proud like this thing
that happens like you get sick after
playlist live and I think it just hit a
lot of people like early this year
because um I was so sick of the usual
work I wanted to write something right
but my favorite ride with you had all
the rides I know but like I was forcing
myself I felt like I was dying while I
was on them but the right it's like the
Hollywood rock terms like a big red one
you play a song so cool like literally
it was so close so happy I got amounts
really close no foundation has been the
go-to lately guys Tori has literally
stopped working foundations
I'm so confused by did you guys have
been watching at home she Larry just on
concealer and there's like now doing
bronzer and I don't understand how she
had it I was just like a really light
coverage powder it's so weird because
like I literally couldn't not put
foundation on but what's like the
weirdest thing can happen this again
rather than Kenzi can be for sure ohtori
about finesse by a cowboy I did
that was weird yes we're at the party
right he pulled like the most basic boy
move ever
yeah he like grabbed well this is where
he dropped my wenis like this party girl
penis and he was like I was like hello
and then he was like hi I was like hi
and then he was like I just miss a
little beautiful girl I've ever said my
god that is the most basic line of boy
could ever use and then he was like you
want to let go talk to a minute I'm like
no like I'm about to leave it my friend
and he was like no just like one minute
and I was like I just really got so
we're right here in the middle of the
party and then she'd be like do you want
to go talk I know it looks out your guy
of the party like that was why I was
weird so then I was like I turn to
Keenan Molly and Kenzie I was like wait
for me and I like look for them the
entire time I'm talking to them and they
leave real well so I regularly enough
stuff like talking to this kid for like
30 minutes sooner we love the party we
