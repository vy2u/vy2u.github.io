to be a get ready with me sorority rush
so this is actually going up after I've
already rushed and I wanted to film this
video because I feel like I wanted to
include you guys in my rush and I
thought it was kind of like a different
idea I don't see a ton of makeup
tutorials on things like this and I know
a lot of times girls struggle with like
oh my gosh how am I supposed to look
when I'm rushing or how much to look on
this and so I figured I would just film
how I'm getting ready for my rush this
is exactly what I'm wearing and exactly
the make I'm going to be doing for rush
so I hope you guys like this also you
guys highly requested H row with the
modern renaissance palette so I use only
the modern renaissance palette for my
eyes so hope you guys like this video
and let's get into it
okay so first we are going to I use this
as a primer I don't think it's a primer
but it's the glam glow mega illuminator
and it's pink and it smells like pina
colada so I think that's honestly my
reason it oh I put too much and the
reason that I use it rub it in moving on
I'm going to go to my go-to Foundation
which is the make up forever foundation
so you guys know I'm doing two pumps on
the back of my hand
lighter Foundation and then one pump of
the darker foundation I'm going to mix
them together with my Sigma black Buki
brush and f80
I filmed this makeup today and it
literally turned out so bad
so I'm refilling it for you guys you
better appreciate this because I have
nothing to do today
and I'm about to beat my face so now to
make sure there's no like lines from I
on my brush I'm going to blend it or Pat
it and I guess who I damn beauty liquor
now on to whoa I cannot open this okay I
think it my concealer okay so I'm going
to use this one because I'm a lazy and I
can't get it open this is my pure
cosmetics concealer I'm putting this all
under my eyes to highlight want to post
a video like this because I feel like I
hadn't been posting a lot of like other
content videos like makeup tutorials and
other things like this and I felt like I
haven't been like sharing a lot of my
life with you guys I've just been so
busy with school so I figured if I
included you guys in like my rush and
some type of way me rushing and doing
sororities and all stuff that would kind
of help I want to include you guys in my
life as much as possible so I figured a
little makeup tutorial and like talking
to you guys would help that now we're
contouring with the other end of this I
mean this before I'm actually wishing I
know this is the makeup and the outfit
I'm going to wear for rush I just
haven't actually rushed yet by the time
this video goes up I will know what
sorority I'm in so if you guys are
interested because I obviously can't put
it in right now
but Thomas video goes up I'll know which
sorority I'm in so you guys can go like
check my Instagram or something I'm sure
I would have posted a picture with it
now I'm going to bake my face because
this is I don't know I really like
baking so Oh guys I just poured powder
all over myself
guys I want y'all to see this I just I
just poured powder all in my garage
so this is why I'm not God moving on
from that I'm going to be taking this
little cosmetic sponge and baking my
face or my under eyes I'm baking mine my
camera's crooked now oh my god guys this
is terrible honestly if you guys are
wanting to learn about baking your face
I would click out of this video because
I do everything wrong for brows so I'm
going in with my an associate dip brow
pomade in soft brown and the other day I
went to a nail place to get my nails
done and Lydia was like do you want your
brows done and I was like you know I'll
just get them done here whatever ya got
was the worst decision of my life she
basically took my whole I fell off
obviously not really the like she made
it so then can you guys guess which
eyebrow it is because yep it's this one
that I'm doing right now it's hideous
and I keep having to over twine it and
overfill it in because she literally
took my bra off also after she took my
Rolph she like asked me if I like it and
I was like no and she was like why and I
was like I asked you to just shake them
please like I didn't I asked you to just
clean them up not shape them and she was
like oh well they look normal now says
who who says they look normal they look
normal before you messed my Rosa Betty I
find my fault for asking you to do my
eyebrows anyway
setting them with my Anastacio clear
brow gel because for some reason if you
guys have this problem for your eyebrows
legit fly to the other side of your face
you need to set them because mine did
that for the longest time and I set them
everyday now so that they are stuck
there so for this look I'm using only
the modern renaissance palette which I
am in love with by the way I asked you
guys if you wanted me to do like a fully
dedicated video with just this palette
and you guys said yes
that's what I'm doing I'm using tempera
to just set all over my lid as a
transition color I'm going to be using
golden ochre and
Bourne fresco which is like a light pink
and like a light brown I don't know why
I sound like I know what I'm talking
about right now but I literally don't
know I'm going to take red oka ochre oak
ochre oka I don't know
Shawnee Grumman says oka oh I don't know
she says it in like a way that I feel
like is right but anyway I'm gonna put
this on the outer corner and the inner
corner leaving the center as you can see
completely empty but then I'm going to
blend them in the crease really lightly
if you take the red up like way too far
it's going to look like someone hit you
in the face and it's healing that's what
it's going to look like but you
basically want to just keep deepening
that part up also if you guys watched my
dorm tour this is how my makeup was in
my dorm tour and I got so many comments
saying that my makeup look good and to
do a tutorial on it so like when you
know two birds one stone anyway I'm
going to take my mac fix+ and my brush
and oh god spray and spray it and then
I'm going to go in with Primavera which
I really don't like the name of this but
I'm going to lightly put this in the
center it's so pigmented like guys will
look at that oh my god
anyway I'm gonna put that in the center
of both eyelids and this is gonna open
up your eye so much then I'm also going
to put it on the brow bone to highlight
I feel like you can make this as
dramatic or as like less dramatic as you
need it to be so depending on where
you're from fades if it's like super
simple rushing and it's like you don't
need to go all out and they do a full
crazy like I tutorial contour and all
that don't do that like this
even just like oh my gosh you have to do
your makeup like this for rush this is
just how I'm getting ready for rush and
how if you guys want to do it you guys
can do it like this or if you guys just
want to see how I did this makeup
Detroit here you are you're welcome
you're actually not welcome this video
is probably trash so now I'm going to do
eyeliner and I'm doing this so far from
the camera my kid oh my god how did I
just do that I literally don't know like
I'm actually confused us how I just did
that Oh killed it Oh kill day if you
guys could see how far I am from a
mirror right now and that was amazing
now I'm going in with my the falsies
pushup drama mascara and oh god I'm just
gonna do the top of my lashes I'm going
to wipe my bacon way now going with my
Kat Von D shade a light palette to
contour my face I'm using these two
shades as usual I have a new favorite
bronzer and it's from this pure love
your selfie set and it is composition is
what it's called it's like this right
here I love it I'm obsessed with it for
a bronzer especially what I have spray
tans because I think it's just like the
perfect darkness if that makes sense so
I'm going to mix my golden bronze for my
glow kit and this powder I seriously
feel like after I contour my face like I
feel so much better I don't know why but
I feel like I'm a new person now for my
new favorite blush which is by Sigma oh
my gosh look how perfect this is and I
feel like it goes with my eyes pretty
well complements and makeup today so I'm
going to be using this
to highlight I'm using sunburst and
bubbly because I've got so much powder
like on my face I always like to do a
lot of highlight because I feel like it
makes me look more glowy and not as like
powdery I want it to look like want my
skin to look like I'm glowing but it's
not really my skin it's just like fake
the litter to my Modern Renaissance pot
I'm taking red ochre and I'm putting it
underneath my waterline and finally I'm
going to do the lips first I'm gonna put
some aquaphor on so for this look I'm
going to using it Kandy K also I got the
whole birthday edition thing the kylie
jenner birthday kit you know what I'm
talking about
I just want to see a makeup tutorial
using like everything from that kit I
know there's tons out right now but if
you guys do want to see that um I would
totally do that you guys asked me to do
one in Renaissance palette so I'm doing
that but if you guys want to see that I
would love to do it I love I still
haven't tried out a lot of the cream
shadows and stuff like that so if you
guys want to see that let me know going
to line my lips with spice lip liner now
I'm filling that in with the candy Kay
liner and then now the liquid lipstick
so this is the final look up you guys
like this hope this was simple um but
yeah let's get into the outfit so for my
outfit I'm wearing the stress umbrella
from Urban Outfitters it's so comfy I
just want it to be comfy but also cute
and then I paired it with these heels
from Steve Madden actually got them off
of Lulu's but they're just suede nude
