or desired what's up guys
so David is going to be my get ready
with me summer bronzy kind of look I
just got sprayed literally yesterday
which is why I was like you know what I
want to still just bronzy makeup look I
also did this makeup look I posted it on
my Twitter and my Instagram you got
you're like oh my gosh yeah please film
a look to this so I figured I would
because it's the makeup I've been doing
a lot recently so I hope you guys like
vo give it a big thumbs up if you guys
do like it and follow me on all my
social media in case you aren't already
because that's where I'm getting most of
my inspiration you guys are always
commenting on my stuff telling me what
to do I'm going to be done talking and
listed into the video so my face is very
real I just got sprayed yesterday so I'm
literally the darkest I could possibly
be but again I don't to my face it
breaks my fake that makes me look
splotchy so that is why my face is the
color of this wall my arm is not I just
got a huge for our package from Becca
cosmetics obviously this isn't sponsored
but they just sent me a bunch of
highlighter glittery this whole thing is
full of highlighters and I really want
to try one out J but I don't know I
haven't even opened one up yet so let's
see this is the Becca light chaser
highlighter for face and I curl flashes
gold oh my gosh I love bike packaging
look at that it's gold
yeah this looks oh my god stop
no I'm using this today there's no way
I'm oh there's no way I'm not okay yeah
we're doing that the reason I want to
even show you that PR package is because
today I'm using the Becca a backlight
priming filter and this is really really
pretty and since this look is the glowy
I feel I expected cosmetics does an
amazing amazing job of making every like
feature on your face look globally so
like a lot of should I put this cream on
you guys are going to be dead
I go what it like you see how like
automatically shinier I think obviously
don't even know this is four year old
face but for this look I this is what I
use it for I don't see sitting is pretty
because I want this look to be as close
as possible I'm also going it with the
tarts proclo this is a liquid
highlighter I'm literally putting
tiniest stuff might be too much amount
and taking my big under I am adding this
on my cheekbones so I want to put my
foundation over it because my foundation
is so full coverage I like to put this
on because then the glow really comes
through I always struggled with making
like glowy like summer looks do that
always felt that you just like avid as
note I lighter as you could after
everything was on and that is what will
make it glowy but it's literally not
it's honestly all about your primer and
like what you put on underneath because
it seems weird that you would put all
this on they cover up a foundation but I
swear it comes through and it helps so
much now I'm going in with my Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof long wear
foundation this is in the shade 4.5
honestly and not sure if this is my
exact shade honestly seems a little bit
light but we're gonna make it work today
so this is something I have been doing
recently and I post a picture like it on
my Instagram which is like where you
guys are telling me to do this look so I
saw a picture of Kendall Jenner and
I will put it right here and it's where
shells like freckles and I know that
they're drawn on for a shoot which I
think they're really really cute on her
and I was like you know what this would
be so cute it's like if you did your
makeup to where you could still see your
freckles because I have so many freckles
but I always put full coverage
foundation on and you can never see the
mask Felix Ethel's just make you look
like you're like naturally like I don't
know just like you instead of using a
concealer and instead of using all those
things to lighten up my under eyes why
don't I just not cover my under eyes so
that's what I'm doing currently so if
you guys can see I put all of my
foundation on except for right under my
eyes it looks like I'm just like
naturally kind of highlighted there but
it's honestly one because my skin is way
lighter than like my actual skin tone
but I've also done this when I was pale
and it works the same way but it's just
like naturally highlighting it but you
can still see all of my freckles so it
looks like Sun kiss but I'm also still
going to do like a full-on
be face if that makes sense so that is
what I'm doing today in case you guys
are wondering I do not put my foundation
up under my eyes I am blending it here
so it's not like a lined of foundation
and then my under always put a friendís
I'm going to show my brows really
quickly and then I'm going to get into
the questions that you had that someone
asked what is the most embarrassing
thing you've done in front of a guy that
you like I've definitely tried it before
which is really really embarrassing like
it's honestly tragically embarrassing
because I wasn't like silent like it was
like it was there and it was known so
that was pretty freaking embarrassing
someone said a house is dating life in
college
literally non-existent like I don't
think that I could honestly date anyone
in college I know that's weird but I
I have no possible contenders in my life
someone said you let your friends for
all your clothes yes literally you can
ask all of my friends my closet is
basically like just go shopping like
when I'm not home people just come to my
house nobody hi can I borrow this I'm
just like yeah I'll take it I mean I
don't care it helps a lot of clothes
anyways like if they take one thing it's
not like I'm like oh my god I need it
back I don't really mind I really don't
care okay so today I'm going to UC take
me on vacation
I shall palette bye Kylie I really
really like that me names are on the
back of them I'm probably not going to
say the names anyway but I just wanted
to point that out because I really can't
and I think it's helpful but I am going
to take the lightest shade right here
and this pink shade over here and that's
what I'm setting my lid with this mirror
on the palette go is everything like I
honestly think this is the best she's
done with the palette so far is so bomb
also a love affair I thought about my
first kiss story so my first kiss was
like not good I only like kiss this
person because I was the last one out of
my friend group to like have not kissed
anyone feels like oh my god I need to do
is like this is so sad
by lamping a brown shade in the crease
just as a transition but yeah I was like
super embarrassed that I hadn't kissed
anyone like it was honestly so
embarrassing so I like dated this guy
because I really really good and not was
it but if someone said you watch The
Bachelorette and if so who is your
favorite so yes I watch spectra it's
actually Tuesday and yesterday they
didn't have an episode
oh it's 4th of July by the way I'm
filming this on 4th of July so happy
fourth of July guys I hope you guys are
having a great time this is going up
after or it might be on 4th of July you
know what I don't know when I'm
uploading it I might upload it today
also just really quickly and using this
dark brown shade over here and I'm
putting this all over the lid to smoke
it out I absolutely love Rachel to
season so I'm very excited that she was
about to read my favorites have
to be locate Peter like come on now
Peter is amazing Peter is the best guy
ever um I also just think Dean is such a
freaking cutie like I don't know what it
is like
Dean is just so cute like if he doesn't
win which I don't think you will I'm
going to do man I'm literally gonna
follow them in Germany and then because
I absolutely love him someone asked me
to date any of the guys that were in my
latest relationship QA absolutely not
those are literally my bestest friends
in the entire world like we've literally
known each other for so long so I have
not dated any of them a lot of you guys
were wondering that but I mean you can
obviously tell that we're all just like
really good friends so I'm taking this
shade right here it looks pink in the
palette but when it's on your lid it's
actually just a really pretty shimmery
color so I'm putting it on the brow bone
and I'm going to put it on the inner
corner now I'm going in with my Too
Faced better than sex mascara this just
gives me these tickets like blackest
lashes so when I'm going to like a look
like this like I know how about good
smoky eyes it's going to be really
bronzed look I don't have dramatic
lashes I'm not going I'm not trying to
be subtle here I'm trying to be out
there I cannot get this open like oh now
I'm going in with the two-faced dark
chocolate still a bronzer so normally I
know I use the chocolate Soleil bronzer
but this one is much darker as you can
see and I'm actually not going to bronze
up my whole face with this I'm just
going to take this tiny like angled
Sephora brush this is the pro contour
brush and that's literally all I'm going
to do so I'm just placing this in my
cheek bone and I just want to subtly
subtly that's the right word yeah
contour my cheekbones but I'm honestly
I'm not going to like bronze all over my
face just too much so I've actually
never used this before this is the Attar
glisten cheek stain so it's like a
little thing like this and it's
basically a cream cheek color I've never
used it before though I don't put it
directly onto my cheeks oh it's really
pretty
oh I actually really like that let me
take my blush brush and uh flip it out a
little bit because it has like the
perfect amount of glow but still pink is
so perfect for this look and also you
guys can like see but it just gives me a
really really pretty
pinky glow oh I'm going to take the new
Becca what is this called again white
chaser highlighter for face and eye and
pearl flashes gold that is a mouthful so
I'm just going to put this blue my gosh
just see that is so pretty like I am all
about that now I'm going in with the Too
Faced hangover at three and one with
punishing primer so this is just to set
my eye literally with what no that's the
point so now for my lips I'm going in
with the si edit the various contour lip
liner so this is actually a really
pretty lip liner and they have different
shades they're contouring lip liners so
that's why I love them cuz I like to
contour my lips and make them look baked
this is the shade commando so I'm going
in with this it's kind of like a pinky
nude it's more of a pinky nude I did try
the color naked but it was just too pale
for me evil
this is like kind of quarry not gonna
lie but it looks good I get blended with
that lip liner very very well so this is
the finished look today it is a little
bit different considering I didn't use
any concealer which I just thought was
like interesting and fun which is what
I've been trying out a lot recently with
my makeup if you guys want to try it out
to these pictures let me know if you
guys do this kind of like makeup look I
was going to say makeup look but that
didn't make sense anyways I hope you
guys liked today's video give it a big
thumbs up also I just filmed a drive

this week I filmed it with you guys
