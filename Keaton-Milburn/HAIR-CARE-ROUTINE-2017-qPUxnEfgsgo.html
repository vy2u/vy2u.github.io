to be my hair care routine as you can
see I'm doing it vlog style because I
like doing videos vlog style it makes it
more personal those are also happy
birthday balloons from like my birthday
that was August 29th like literally not
even around the time of this video but
today I'm doing my hair care routine
because you guys have been requesting it
literally so much
I guess because recently because I got
my hair gray and it's like really really
white now you guys have been wondering
how I keep it healthy and what I put in
my hair to keep it like this so I'm just
gonna show you guys that right now I'm
about to hop in the shower so let's go
so here I am in the shower my cute
little derma shower I know it's so
attractive so I'm going in with my
Giovanni shampoo this is the tea tree
triple treat invigorating it's a super
long name but is the shampoo that I use
I just use this before I go in with my
favorite this is the shimmer light
shampoo so this is what keeps my hair
white and platinum and if you guys have
blonde hair highly highly recommends
just also in my Q&amp;amp;A if you guys watched
it I'll link that down below but I use
this and I left it in today for probably
a minute but normally if my hair is
really faded and I really need like a
boost I will leave it in for like five
minutes but I love to dump like a matter
of today so that is what it looks like
then I'm just going back in with the
Giovanni yet conditioner this as again
the tea tree triple treat invigorating
conditioner and that is it for my year
care routine in the shower
okay so as you guys can see I'm now out
of the shower my hair is very white and
sometimes when I leave that purple
shampoo in for a little bit it can dye
my hair slightly purple like the ends
are getting a little dark that's because
I probably left the shampoo in for a
little bit too long but it's whatever so
remember to get out of the shower I put
my little robe on this is from Too Faced
they like send it to me or they gave it
to me when I shot with them so I don't
know where it's from I'm sorry guys I'm
also I'm very very pale and that's
because I just took my spray tan off in
the shower
so my white hair and my white
doesn't really look that great but let's
just get into the hair piece of this
haircare routine I have been doing for
probably like a year now almost two
years I think so this is what I've been
doing with my hair I've added a few
products here and there but it's mainly
been the same thing so first thing I'm
going with is this Garnier Fructis
damage eraser split end and this
honestly helps split into so much I
think because my hair like every time I
go the hairdresser they always told me
that and I don't think it's because I am
like good with my hair I think it's
because I use this stuff and so I just
put this in honestly my main thing when
it comes to like hair and like keeping
your healthy I use so many products and
that's because it's like one of them is
bound to work so like even though I
think all of them work together I use so
many hair product to try and keep my
hair healthy so I think that is why it's
healthy like for the amount of times
that I dye my hair white and platinum
and bleach it I literally diet like
every single month that I do put bleach
in it every hair stylist I've ever gone
to is always been like you have such
healthy hair for like the way that you
dye your hair all so often and I'm like
I don't know how and like I never would
have thought that like this stuff I was
using was doing that like I just put it
in my hair to put in my hair but it
shouldnt evenly works because
hairdressers art um there's all times so
after this I go in with this so this is
the b5 waitlist oil mysticism oyster and
vitamin mist and this is by the brand
OGX I'm sure you guys to see these they
haven't like Target CVS things like that
so I used to put them rockin oil in my
hair but I actually like this more
because you could spray it in so I'm on
these I focus I don't like the ends as
you can see it's like right there I'll
do it like in the back of my head
honestly I just feel like this adds like
new nutrition and nutrition to my feet
in my hair I feel like you kind of
aren't feeding your hair you're like
making it like get the nutrients and
stuff that it needs but I feel like this
just helps it like steak soft and also
like adds I don't know maybe I should
read the bottle and see what it's
supposed to do which blend of vitamin b5
that speeds moisture to stress locks
rebuilds damaged us to lipids to improve
ability to retain moisture so yeah I add
this to my hair because you guys know my
hair is dry as hell that's why I always
put like
Muraki
or some type of oil and that's lv5 is
really good that's what I added there
these next two things are because I
don't blow dry my hair I cannot tell you
the last time I don't even own a blow
dryer here like that I don't ever blow
dry my hair the only time it's ever blow
drying is when I go diet and like the
hair person blow dries it but I never
blow dry my hair so these two things I
use because of that so the first one is
the not your mother's natural leave-in
conditioner this is to repair and
protect your hair I was innocent correct
I mean it could correct it to whatever I
have this aid because when I go to sleep
with wet hair obviously you don't want
to be like super tingly you kind of want
like a little bit of a leave-in
conditioner so I just go again on the
ends normally I'll add this like a
little bit more than I did with the b5 I
like to add leave-in conditioner a lot
because I do not want like gross like
dry hair when I wake up and I don't want
it to be tangled and I feel like the
leave-in conditioner helps with that so
much like before I started using this I
would wake up and my hair would feel
like kind of like rough but this helps
it so much so I like to leave that in my
hair and just like run it all through
and then this is the Redken no blow dry
no blow dry no big deal that's what it's
gone it's the just right cream so this
is for people who basically don't blow
dry their hair so it says it provides
easy and soft air dry with effortless
control and movement without a
blow-dryer so basically I put this in my
hands and I put it all on my hair I put
like that much of it and I just work it
into my hair evenly and that's gonna
help so that when I wake up in the
morning it's not like - like when it air
dries it's not like that frizzy and
stuff like that I feel like you should
just like work this end evenly and so
that it doesn't have your hair drying
all like awkwardly my hair is naturally
straight but like sometimes when I let
it air dry it gets a little bit like
frizzy I'm like how's texture and I
don't know why so yeah this is this is
it this is what my hair looks like after
I put all my little products in it there
are four products here I will link the
names of them down below so you guys if
you guys want to try this out you guys
I genuinely I'm obviously this field is
not sponsored but I genuinely see
results from all these products and I
absolutely love them so this is what I
do with my hair again I think that the
shampoo that I use in the shower is
really really helpful for maintaining my
platinum like really really white hair
even if you guys aren't like full-on
silver if you guys have brown hair I
highly suggest getting the purple
shampoo because it can really really
help maintain it and like not make it so
like brassy and yellow so yeah that's
basically it I hope you guys like this
video give it a big thumbs up and let me
know please please please let me know

comments because this video was very
requested that's why I filmed it so if
you guys have any other videos like
seriously I'm taking any suggestions so
