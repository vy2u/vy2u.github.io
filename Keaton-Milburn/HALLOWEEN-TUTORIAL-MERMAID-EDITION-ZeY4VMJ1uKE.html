to be a get ready with me a mermaid
Halloween edition I've always wanted to
film a video at this and so when I got
the opportunity to pair up with Sparkle
and Ally and Arielle I was so excited so
the teacher that I'm wearing which is so
super cute is from Fallon arrow and I'm
going to be leaving the link stomach
down below if you guys are wanting to
buy the t-shirt for your Halloween and
my makeup which is amazing like it's
seriously insane and looks up awesome is
done on the sparkle bar and so I'm going
to leave everything in the description
down below if you guys are interested in
creating this look for Halloween
also just in case you are watching this
and maybe can't do exactly this this is
just to give you guys inspiration on
what you guys can do for Halloween and
if you guys I wanted to recreate a
mermaid look so yeah let's get into it
so start off by priming your face a new
primer that you would normally use to
keep your makeup on and then you're just
going to use any of light foundation
this base is just whatever you guys
would normally use as your own
foundation and then we're gonna start
with the eyes so this is a really pretty
metallic blue shadow and absolutely love
the way this looks again I'm not gonna
list the exact ones here because a lot
of them were a little bit older and they
don't sell them anymore but Urban Decay
has amazing colors for this I'm telling
you like they work perfect and you can
also kind of play with whatever shadows
you guys want but then to contour my
nose she used a darker purple shadow and
then she's bringing that in to the
crease and up my brow bone to make it
symmetrical and kind of blend out the
blue eyeshadow and so as she blends out
the blue eyeshadow in my crease she
makes it a little bit like Messier on
the outside if you know what I'm saying
because she's going to contour around my
forehead and on my cheekbones so the
purple will blend into the blue
contouring that we're gonna do and again
use whatever colors you guys want so she
just continues to go home with the blue
darker Purple's use different shades
you're gonna do purple and blue or pink
and blue whatever you's like darker
shades darker blues darker purples that
kind of thing so it gives your face a
lot more dimension and you look like a
mermaid so yeah she's going in
contouring my forehead with a light teal
eyeshadow all of these are eyes shadows
and then she's gonna go in with a darker
teal and she's going to contour out my
cheekbones and bring it back up to my
forehead so here's what I look like
mid-transformation so she's going in
again with a darker teal color giving it
more dimension this is kind of the whole
process of doing this add darker colors
lighter colors that kind of thing
get your snapchats and guys take all the
snaps um so now she's going in with a
highlighter and this is so so important
I suggest using either like champagne
pop or soft and gentle by Mac I like any
highlighter that you have just hack it
on because that is what's gonna make the
look look super pretty it kind of gives
the illusion of like water kind of um so
now she's contouring on my Cupid's bow
and underneath my lip with the same
purple shadow and again this is just
gonna create more dimensions on my face
and now she dipped a wet sponge into
eyeshadow and this is going to create
scales so put these where ever you like
she did it down my neck collarbone and
then also on my face so there are
seriously so many ways that you guys can
do scales this is just one of them so
look up as many different things as you
want to do it however you would like and
then this next part is my favorite so if
you guys don't do any of the rest of
this video this eyeliner I highly
suggest doing this is a Mac eyeliner
they don't have any more but I will try
and find one super similar but this
seriously helped complete the look so so
much and then we also added false lashes
on the top and bottom which looked
insane like seriously guys it looked so
cool open my eyes up so much and then
we're going in with pearls foil all this
can be found your local craft store you
guys can just stick them
on wherever you want and then she put
eyelash glue on like my collarbone and
my cheekbones like where we'd normally
highlight and then put the foil like
just tapped the gold foil in there and
it looked so awesome so now she is
lining my lips with a purple and blue
lip liner and then filling them in with
a blue a really bright blue lip gloss
and then she adds gold in the center but
I think would also be really cool if you
guys wanted to do a ombre lip if you
guys said like a purple ombr√© and too
blue in the center or if you guys it's
just all gold lip any lip combo you guys
could do with this look what looks so
awesome just because the whole
contouring looks really cool already but
yeah she added gold in the center of
like the blue lip gloss and this just
made my lips pop a bit more so we've
finished the makeup it looks amazing I'm
obsessed with this so now we're going to
French braid my hair so this is the
final look she French braid my hair
added a little starfish which she just
bought at the craft store and she like
glued a little clip on it and clip this
in my hair it turned out amazing and
this shirt is so cute if you guys are
looking for a mermaid kind of Halloween
outfit if you don't have to go out and
buy like a whole mermaid tail I think
this top is so cute and really really
helps the whole mermaid look come across
really really well so check out elliot
ariel and the sparkle bar i will leave

you guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
