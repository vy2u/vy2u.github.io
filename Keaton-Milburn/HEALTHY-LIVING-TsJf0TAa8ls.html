be on healthy living and this is
actually a super super requested video a
lot of you guys have actually been
asking what my fitness routine is and
what I do when I workout and all that
kind of stuff and I'm basically going to
explain to you guys that today and kind
of on like how I eat in like my
lifestyle and just kind of things like
that that go along with living healthy
I'm just gonna be giving you guys a few
tips so the first one would basically be
to get motivated and this is the hardest
thing to do which is why I'm listening
at first it's just it's so hard to
motivate yourself and it's so hard to be
like yes I'm gonna go to the gym today
yes I'm gonna go work out or I'm going
to run or I'm gonna take the stairs not
the elevator just stuff like that and
like I think it's really hard to just be
like okay I'm gonna do this and said
just cuz we're I I mean I know because
I'm so lazy and it took me just a
extremely long time to get to where I am
now or actually go and work out but
basically you just have to find
something that gets you motivated so
something that has really really helped
me is an app and it's actually called
the pump up app the app is actually just
a super motivational app for me and for
me that's like my number one thing like
I go on my Instagram and there's this
girl named Kayla in this or whatever and
she like has the most amazing progress
pictures ever and I was like oh my gosh
I love her but this app puts all of them
like in one place so basically it has a
feed of a bunch of different people that
you can follow and see all their new
stuff so it has a popular page and you
can basically see everything about
working out so you can see people's
progress pictures food meals like
different ideas of stuff that you can do
there's actually a lot of different
things you can do so you can log your
activities you can say robots archery
bowling cheerleading climbing CrossFit
you can do anything like that so any
sport that you've done you can log in on
here you can also start a workout so you
can go to like beginner and start a
bunch of different workouts you can
click at home or at the gym and then you
can also share a photo so you can share
photos of your
your own progress results and different
things like that just to get other
people following you and motivate
yourself which I think it helps me when
I upload pictures like this is what you
look like it's what you look like now
and I think it's really really cool
so I actually have an account on the app
and I posted a picture right here it is
pump up app and it's it's honestly so
motivational if you guys are trying to
get to work out your guys are trying to
I don't know you have a goal for
yourself this helps you so much and it
has a bunch of different workouts on it
and just a bunch of different people
really motivating you and I love it a
lot just for me since I've really been
getting into working out a lot more um
so yeah go download the pump up add my
username is Keaton Wilber and I'll leave
it right here um but yeah follow me and
I want to see you guys like proc results
if you're getting into working out I
love looking at meals on this app just
because I'm like I don't know I like
looking at like fruit salads or like
like I don't know anything like this I
think it's so cute and like makes me
want to do it so yeah go check it out I
really really love that app so that is
definitely the first tip the first tip
is to get motivated the next thing that
really helps me which kind of doesn't
sound like it would but is to get enough
sleep and this one is just because like
I feel like if I don't have enough sleep
the day before about to go work out or
whatever it just it it's not helping you
at all to be tired than that just
laziness and it's just getting enough
sleep puts me in such a better mood and
it just makes me feel so much better
about myself so I'm definitely say get
at least like 7 or 8 hours of sleep the
next thing is to set a goal so setting a
goal for yourself like for me I have
different goals all the time I'll be
like who I want to look like this and
I'll save a picture or whatever or if
it's an event so you have a wedding
coming up or you have prom I know prom
is coming up for a lot of people
especially me I want to be like super
fit for prom and stuff like that so just
things like that really really help you
get to where you want to go another
thing that comes with goals though is
not being too upset if you don't meet
your goals yes you want to meet your
goal all the time and stuff like that
and you want to get to where you want to
go but if you don't meet it I don't
think that this should be like
punishments like okay well I'm not gonna
have dinner because
I didn't do all my crunches today I
don't know anything like that I just
feel like that's not really the right
way to go but I would set a goal that
helps you get motivated and if you don't
reach it you just keep pushing until you
meet your goal and I think that's more
of the point than punishing yourself for
not meeting the goal the next thing kind
of relates but I think it would be to
not take it so seriously I think that a
lot of people like working out is like
hardcore and they think it's like so
intimidating and I think that if you're
doing it for you and you're doing it
because you want to feel healthy and you
want to feel good about yourself and
stuff like that then I think that you
don't need to take it so seriously and
turn it into like some body builder or
whatever um but do it for you and do it
because you want to be doing it the last
thing I have to say is just to keep your
diet colorful and this is the only food
tip that I have for you guys really I
don't eat vegetables breakfast lunch and
dinner like I don't eat super super
healthy all the time I try my best to
make better decisions than what I used
to make I have been making better
decisions than I used to make but I
think just keeping your diet colorful
having fruits instead of some sweets
like maybe strawberries or like
pineapple something like that I mean I
understand cheat days like that's
whatever that's fine but I think just
keeping your diet colorful and not being
like okay I have to have this this and
this I don't really ever follow strict
diets because it just it puts more
pressure on me and then I feel like if I
break the done it I'm like in trouble
with myself and so I just feel like
keeping your diet colorful is the best
thing confections fruits whatever if you
want a cheat day make a cheat day and
not be your cheat day whatever so now
I'm talking about my workout routine so
I actually was going to make a video on
this a while ago when you guys are
requesting it on what I do when I
workout but I actually go to a gym now
and I actually have a trainer so
basically the reason I have a trainer is
because when I go to the gym I just the
first time I went to the gym I was so
overwhelmed and was like I don't know
what I'm doing and I'm not to work these
machines I don't know anything that I'm
doing so I was like I need someone to
tell me what to do and it's also a lot
more motivating and helpful when I have
someone being like no keep going you
could do this so I actually have a
trainer but before I started going to
returner I did how
little thing on my notes that I got from
Alex uttama I got it from her YouTube
channel so I'm gonna leave like the
workouts I used to do before I started
going to a trainer down below because
they're really really helpful and I
loved him I did them like every single
day before I went to a trainer but now I
just feel like going to a trainers
better so you guys can find a gym near
you a small gym make gym whatever and
get a trainer I would suggest that
because I like it more but that's just
me and a lot of you guys were asking how
many times I do workout or how many
times in a gym or whatever I try and go
at least three or four times a week it's
hard but I try and go at least three to
four times a week it might not seem like
a lot to other people but I have school
and broadcasting and lots of other
things and YouTube I have you guys so um
managing that is kind of whatever but
yeah that's basically all the tips I
have for you guys I'm gonna leave my
pump up app name down below so you guys
can go check it out i really suggest you
get this app it's super helpful super
motivating and it just it's really
helped me if you guys are starting to
workout you're wanting to workout that I
definitely suggest so that's basically
it for this week's video and I hope you
guys liked it I will see you guys next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
