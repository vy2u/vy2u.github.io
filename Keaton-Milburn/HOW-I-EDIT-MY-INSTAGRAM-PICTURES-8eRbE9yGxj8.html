edit my Instagram pictures and this has
been super super requested by you guys
I've actually already done a what's on
my iPhone kind of video but most of the
apps are basically the same from that
video so this video is going to be
showing you guys a few of the new apps I
have and then also just how I edit my
Instagram pictures so yeah let's get
started when you open my phone it is
just this picture of New York and I
don't know I got off tumblr so that's
that and my background is a picture of
Kylie Jenner which I'm obsessed with her
so obviously and then like the news app
is right there just because I don't know
I never moved it when I updated my phone
so this is my home screen basically all
these apps are all the same the only
thing that's new is probably like
Spotify and this is how I make all my
playlists I'm just kind of getting into
it so I'm not really sure to do all that
but I have a bunch of playlists here so
you guys can go see that my Spotify name
I'll leave right here it's just Keating
over in Excel so that's that app so the
next side is just all of my old like
apps I've already shown like all of
these in my what's in my iPhone video
because I don't think any of them are
really like new so yeah that's that the
only two that are new are not in the
folders and it is the Kylie Jenner app
and the CW app so I use both of those
apps to to use the Kylie Jenner app just
to keep up with her life if you guys
don't have the app it's two dollars so
on this app you can just see like
everything kylie jenner you guys can
just see like the most random stuff I
don't even know cop hairstyle sneak
peeks all this kind of stuff so I'm
obsessed with her and so the app is
super amazing the next app is the CW app
and I use this app because I'm obsessed
with America's Next Top Model
and America's Next Top Model is on
Fridays so most of the time I miss it so
I go on CW and watch the full episodes
but let's just get right into how I edit
my Instagram pictures so this is kind of
my editing folder and this I really
don't use like that often I've used
any of these apps almost except for
SoundCloud and I don't know why it's in
my editing folder I only really use vsco
cam so vsco cam is right here this is
just a additive app that I am obsessed
with everyone uses this app so I'm gonna
click a library so your library when you
open your app is all the pictures that
you've ever like imported to edit so
like say you want to add a new picture
you just click the little plus at the
top and then let's say I wanted to edit
this picture so I click it and it
imports into my library so how I edit my
pictures is mostly I would take pictures
with a white kind of background and yes
as a selfie I just took but I'll take
them with a white background to go with
my theme then I'm gonna click these two
little lines and these are all the
filters it doesn't come with all of
these these the first ones that start
with a are ones you can download by
yourself so I use the same filter and I
always use a six and this just kind of
brightens the picture you can see from
the original and then you can see from a
six it brightens it up so I love the
look of a white bright picture sucker
that I clipped little up arrow and then
I click the toolbar and this is just
like a bunch of different kind of things
it has saturation I can make myself more
tan it has brightness which it has
exposure which I normally put on the
picture because this is okay but if I
want my picture really white I'm gonna
add exposure to it so I'll do that then
I can crop the picture but since it's
already in a square I don't want to crop
it and then this just has a bunch of
other stuff like contrast stuff like
that and I don't ever really put
contrast on it the only things I do is
probably brighten it which put an
exposure up and then put saturation up
and then I will sharpen it and I'll put
it to about six which just like makes my
picture look a little more clear that is
my picture so once I do that to see if
it goes with my Instagram theme I will
swipe over and this is my vsco cam
account so this is what I use to upload
pictures that I want to see go with my
feed so say I want to upload that
picture I just did I'll press the plus
and then I'm gonna click up your library
from vsco cam so it's like
everything you've ever edited again so
I'm gonna click the selfie I just took
and then I'm gonna click the check so
that I know what's going on I'm not
gonna put a caption I'm just gonna like
click the little check and upload it to
my Instagram well two might be a Co cam
and so once it's on there I can kind of
see like what it looks like with my
pictures so this is what it would look
like with the rest of my pictures and as
you can see it kind of goes with the
white theme and so I do this so I don't
have to upload Instagram pictures onto
my Instagram and like see if it goes
because if it doesn't go then I have to
delete it but then people have you liked
it so it's weird but that's basically
what I do so now I'm gonna show you what
I would picture that just didn't go with
my theme that I thought it would so this
one because actually okay here so say I
thought this picture went with my theme
I'll click it and I'll put a little
check and then I'll upload it but once
it's uploaded then I'm gonna be able to
tell that it just doesn't go so this is
what it looks like with the rest of the
pictures and as you can see it the
background is more blue so I don't want
that so I'm gonna click the picture and
then I'm going to click the little
circle with the dots and I'll just
delete the photo so that's how you do
that if you upload one - you're like
vsco cam account that you don't want but
that's basically all I do on how I edit
my Instagram pictures sometimes if the
picture is a bright enough I'll go on to
end super brighten it up beforehand I
can make it really bright or I can just
put it up a little bit and then I'll go
back into vsco cam and edit that or I
can - app and this is called relook so
it's almost like face tune so I can
click relook and once I click this I can
take any picture that is not white
enough and I can make it more white by
taking by going to this little circle
right here the third circle and I'm
gonna click lighten so basically what
this is is like I can color anything
that's white in with white or like with
a I don't even know what this does it
just like lightens the picture so
anything that's rty I'm just going to
make it even more
what you can do a lot of stuff with this
app but this is like the main thing that
I do because it just makes it like 10
times more white and see how my
foreheads super dark compared to the
rest of my body I can zoom in and I can
kind of darken my forehead
like it just got so much darker so now
it kind of fits with my face and then
I'll just save it and I'll just save it
to my camera roll so that is basically
how I edit my Instagram pictures it's
super super simple and I know tons of
youtubers make videos like this all the
time if you guys want to know how I edit
mine that is how I do it if you guys
have any other questions about this
video just comment down in the comments
below and let me know what other videos

video was suggested by you guys so
that's why I did it so you have any
other videos that you really really want
me to do just comment down below I read
