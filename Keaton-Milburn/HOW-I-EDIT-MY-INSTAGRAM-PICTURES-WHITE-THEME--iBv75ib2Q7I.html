kidding okay those are just a bunch of
editing apps which I'm not even going to

this one is my to asu apps i don't know
what the difference is between those I

the corner of my room but she doesn't
work right now she's dead okay and okay
the last folder is all sports so this is
my ESPN watching c-span CNN Fox Sports
Fox Sports Go CBS this is because I am
always trying to watch football games
and basketball games and stuff when I am
out somewhere else and so these apps are
super helpful for that obviously so
that's all my apps enough of the boring
stuff let's show you guys how I edit my
Instagram pictures so going in here I
just added a bunch of selfies so like
don't mind me but here's a bunch of
pictures I've recently edited if you
guys have never seen my Instagram I will
show you guys right now I have no
internet so whatever okay so this is my
Instagram it is as you can see mainly
white but a lot of it isn't like okay it
used to be a lot brighter down here this
feed like right here these like four
rows were like my life like I thought
they went together so well and then as I
don't know I just started struggling it
got a little darker on these two rows
like these pictures on these rows got a
little bit darker so then I started
brightening it back up but basically I
like to keep my Instagram theme somewhat
white ish so how I do that so obviously
you have to take pictures on a more
white background as you can see here
okay this would not ever be uploaded so
I took a bunch of pictures with like my
friends and we just took pictures but we
took them on a white background so I
don't really need to do any major
editing
I literally just edit the picture and
then I upload it same with this I just
laid them on something already white but
if I wanted to upload a picture I would
never upload like any of these because
these are super dark and sorry these are
super objects for you an example I'm
going to go into the visco app and we're
going to pick a picture that is somewhat
dark that I'm going to try and brighten
up a little bit okay so I use a six and
it is still obviously you can see a
difference this is it's pretty dull I
use a six brightens up a little bit and
then I go to the second settings and I
normally go to about three for the
brightness and that is automatically
like whiter and then I will go to this
triangle and this is sharpen so I'm
going to turn it up to like six and I
just think it makes it look a lot more
clear and then I'm still going to go to
saturation and turn some of the
saturation down I don't like when it's
like obviously if you can see the colors
brighter here but I like to turn the
saturation down and then I go to this
which is like a little temperature thing
and if I bring it down you can make it
tented blue I like to bring it up one
and make it tinted like a little bit
warmer but this is already pretty wide
so I'm going to keep it how it is but
normally if it was like kind of tented
blue I would make it warmer I don't like
blue tents on my feed so I'm going to
save that to camera roll actual size and
for the sake of this video I'm going to
show you guys what I would look like if
I were to hey Tory what's up girl um I'm
going to show you guys what it would
look like if I were to upload it and it
would just go with my feed so let's go
to camera this is
it even when I go on Instagram after
I've already edited I will still
probably brighten it up a little bit and
you guys will see here there you go
posting and now it fits with my feet I'm
going to delete it really quickly though
so bye guys
sorry about that but as you can see
that's basically how I make all my
pictures go to a go to ever was that
even English go together I do I would
suggest if you guys are going for like a
more white theme then take pictures
already with the bright background makes
things so much easier but if you guys do
need to brighten them up that is how I
personally do it that's how I brighten
up any pictures that I have so I hope
this video helps you guys so much you
guys have been requesting it forever so
I hope this video helped you guys and
