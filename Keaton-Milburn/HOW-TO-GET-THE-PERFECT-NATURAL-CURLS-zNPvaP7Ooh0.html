but you gotta be there for me too what's
up guys so today's video is going to be
on this hair right here I feel like no
one really does hair tutorials anymore
like we used to do hair draw all the
time when you do but you guys have been
requesting how I curl my hair for a
while cuz you guys see a bunch of
pictures on my Instagram so I figured I
would just do a quick little tutorial
for you guys so you guys can see how I
do it it's so easy and so simple but you
guys are asking for it if you guys are
new to this channel don't forget to give
a big thumbs up if you guys like this
video and subscribe hit that
notification buzz so you guys are
notified when I'm posting follow me on
Instagram and Twitter so you guys can
see what I'm up to because that's where
I get a lot of you guys feedback that's
how I knew how to film this video
because of my Instagram so thank you
guys so much for that and yeah let's
just get right into the video
alrighty guys so the first thing that
I'm going to do is use a heat protectant
because as you can see I dyed my hair
often and I always side my hair but I
try not to use heat as much as possible
so what I do I want to use the heat
protectant so I've always used the in a
heartbeat blow-dry accelerator so it
just basically reduces drying time
provides thermal protection blah blah
blah so I just spray this on my hair I
don't do a lot cuz it makes your hair
like really really damp and that's not
what you want so there's just gonna burn
your hair more when you put heat on damp
hair it's gross next up this is totally
preference but I use dry shampoo so this
is the freshen-up dry shampoo by Ava and
I see I don't remember where I got this
I think I got a head like a beauty con
or something and like the bag but I just
use it to give me like a little bit more
texture my hair is literally like clean
right now but I like I feel like it
helps like dirty my hair up a little bit
and it helps hold a curl more and it
helps like volumize it so i just add it
in the root I think texture is super
important if you guys ever try and curl
your hair like the day after you wash it
and it doesn't stay it's because so
cleaning doesn't have any like oil or
like anything to stick onto it so that's
why I use this so now I'm gonna separate
my hair I'm going to just do it
half-up half-down kind of I only do two
layers when I curl my hair I know some
people do like multiple layers but you
know because I'm casually balding from
dying my hair all the time I don't
have that much hair to curl so yeah so
we're just gonna do two this is
literally it as you can see it's like
crimped from the other day I had braids
in my hair it's just the first most
important thing you need is a curler
that is like this size I need to look up
what size it is I don't know the exact
size I'll list it right here but this is
actually the collaboration that
graveyard girl here on YouTube did with
follow me and this one size is perfect
also super cool like the one a bit super
cool but it's really good to do it with
a huge sized curler because if you don't
then your curls are end up being like
really small also I just touched my ear
with this curler so stop taking a piece
of hair about this size I'm gonna wrap
it behind you don't want it to be too
tight you want it like just about right
there I used to alternate the way that I
comb my hair so I used to do it like
this way first and then forwards the
next way but I don't curl my hair like
that anymore now I do it all the same
way you guys will see like why in the
end but it's because I want it to all
look kind of the same I worked all look
like naturally I don't know I mean I
know your hair does it naturally all
curl the same way but this that's what I
do and for the most part I don't curl
like I don't wrap the one all the way up
I really only do like the ends towards
like the middle of the piece of hair
after each section I hairspray it so I'm
using the Herbal Essence body Envy
volumizing hairspray this smells so good
and I've uses forever so I just lightly
spray it and I know it seems like a lot
of hairspray but you meet this curl to
hold it because it is so loose that you
need it to like stay like that until the
end also if this helps you I take all my
hair that I have on like the top layer
that I haven't curled yet and I push it
all forward and then I take the pieces
that I've already curled and I put them
behind me so I don't like mix them
together and that they're curled
separate
- next up I'm gonna take a piece about
this bag as you can see this is like
huge and you don't really want like a
big swoosh so I'm going to break it into
two separate pieces so this is the piece
closer to the top of my head unlike on
the underneath pieces I'm not just doing
the ends for the top pieces of my head
I'm doing closer to the scalp and I'm
doing more the whole piece of hair so
this is this piece that I just throw it
back
okay so once you hear us like this
obviously it looks a little spirally and
it's like not all together and I
obviously don't like spiral curls that's
just like we're not doing that like I
said 2018 we're over that the next thing
that has been key to getting my hair to
just look like wavy and more natural and
not so like perfectly curled is a wide
toothed comb this is like so so
important I've been using this book a
few months now and I just love it I also
feel like it damages your hair way less
so basically with this instead of just
like combing your hair with the regular
comb it just makes it way more loose so
now you can see that the waves are just
like going down way more if I were to
brush this with my regular just like
hair brush it just would not look right
like it would just frizz up and get
really really big as opposed to using a
wide tooth comb and it just breaks it up
a little bit more obviously when my hair
was like a little bit crimped it house
like these lines in it I'll probably
take a straightener over the top of my
hair and get those like lines out later
but you guys get the point
and then I just took a little bit
hairspray and I add it in there
depending on if you guys like to tease
your hair or you guys want more volume
you guys can do that I pretty like flat
hair obviously like my roots are like
literally flat down to my head but if
you guys do want more volume you guys
can always take a little teasing comb
and tease your hair up a little bit you
guys probably like Keaton oh my god your
hair so short extensions people have
purple extensions which my hair really
isn't that purple anymore but yeah I'm
the catfish so I use those extensions if
I would have my extensions in this video
would be like 20 times longer because
they take forever to curl so that's it
for this hair look I hope you guys liked
it if you guys want to see more videos
like this give it a big thumbs up and if
you guys liked it don't forget to
subscribe I would love to have you guys
in my little family don't forget to
follow me on Instagram and Twitter as
you guys are updating on what I'm doing
and yeah I always see you guys succeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
