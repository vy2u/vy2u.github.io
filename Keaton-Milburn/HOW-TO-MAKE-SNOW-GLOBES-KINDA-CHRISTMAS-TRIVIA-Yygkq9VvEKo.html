bit yeah you're so luscious what's up
guys today i'm joined by my sister we
have our cute little reindeer ears on
when a ratchet because penis is better
these are bending forward but just
ignore them because already cut out and
hurry so today we are making snow globes
that are Christmas holiday themed I've
never really done a DIY and I don't
really like DIYs but when I was in
Michaels picking all this stuff out I
got really freaking excited about all
the separate runs of put in there we've
been wanting to do this for like a year
yeah like these are contrasting laughter
the ones you see on Pinterest that are
like a giant house like all the stuff I
wasn't gonna be that elaborate but
they're gonna be really cute so we're
each making a small thingy and then
we're gonna make the big Papa no man
we're gonna make this one so we're gonna
put some other stuff in here okay get
your jar snow survived big yeah probably
a large about yeah um you get this
snazzy thing and we got all this stuff
at Michaels and you can go to Michael's
and buy the exact same stuff in the
access one okay take care you guys
should just take this
you know forget it forget it bro and you
guys have to buy these um the bags of
snow this is frosty snow don't know what
that word is
but this is some flaky snow so when you
go to Michael's do what my mom did my
mum said where's the flaky snow because
there is the snow that looks like the
cotton it looks like cotton balls yeah
it's like lay it in there but you want
the flaky snow so you can sprinkle it in
there and then we bought this what is
this word because it's showing up on
everything what is this word I don't
know but it's smell spray I've never
used this before so it's - my god yeah
please supposed to look like that but
we'll find out when I pour it in my
little snow globe this is what we're
gonna do we're gonna pour the snow into
the jar Ellie I am and then once we glue
this on there we're gonna char that has
a clear side so you can see it yeah and
we'll probably have writing on it but
you know get the clear at the clear jar
this is we're gonna do how the grinch
no review the Grinch was moving out the
Grinch Stole Christmas trivia well what
was the most likely reason that the
Grinch hated Christmas because his heart
was too small how small
that does not fit what doesn't fit that
tree I really you don't need it this
tree don't fit
look at this trailer it's really not
gonna look good
you're not get the thin one shut up
look at this Merry Christmas new trivia
can i Ryan Seacrest in here because my
mom doesn't know the answer
the sup guys don't freaking make me this
because they don't turn out how you want
them to turn off because this rig just
covers up everything you put in it so
forget it just just don't even try with
this yeah good job good it's freaking
boring alright okay that you just take
any other you doesn't wrap it up
and fold it wait not like that yeah you
do you just rip it up and you fold it
and you're gonna just set it underneath
whatever they can't see it cuz they John
fine they don't need to know you just
like fold it up underneath whatever you
know you want to you want to make taller
so this is the platform for my
All Right see ya oh my god it's snowing
up that's disgusting
look what they you need to do it from
like really far like King don't do it
