to be a little bit different I haven't
really decided what I'm naming this but
basically I could have had a very weird
day Holly if you're watching this shout
out to you for like always being there
when I need you but I just had a really
weird day and I was sitting in class
today and I was like I really want to
share what like not to do in high school
because I've done a lot of stupid things
in high school and not even just in high
school just in school in general 7th 8th
grade like I'm just I just always been a
weird student I feel like and I feel
like a lot of you guys don't know like
all the things I'm like done in high
school or like what I've done with my
life and throughout all of my years of
school because I'm graduating in like
two weeks
I'm just like I want to share these with
you guys because I feel like it might
help you and also I just have some
really funny stories that I like wanted
to show you guys and I feel like you
guys might want to hear them so hey my
little sheet of paper here okay so the
first thing I'm gonna tell you guys I'm
just gonna be telling you guys like tips
of things that like you definitely
should do while you're in school and I
know for personal experience so I'm
gonna tell you guys like stories of like
why you should follow this world because
like stuff has happened to me so the
first one would be to literally follow
the rules I think there's a there's no
reason you need to break the rules like
honestly the rules are set their own
place and like I am NOT a very big rule
follower I mean I am a rule follower but
like not that much I also like just feel
like sometimes I can no it's fine I'll
just get away with it like let me just
do this real quick I just feel like if
you don't follow the rules there's
always a consequence there's always
something like bad that's gonna happen
to you and I'm just like oh my god like
well why didn't I just follow it like
why didn't I just listen why did I think
I can get around the rules and that's
like the number one thing I've learned
throughout high school is just like why
couldn't you just listen even like why
couldn't you just pay attention so the
first one is one time I was really
hungry and I was talking to this guy and
I was like oh like you can bring me to
play or whatever so he's like yeah I can
meet chick-fil-a like just normally you
just like drop off the food and like
it's fine like you just leave it out the
front like service window but because he
was
and he didn't have school that day I was
like no it's fine you can just come
inside which like I've seen other
students from other schools that come in
and eat lunch but I don't feel like I
don't know I guess the administration
like wasn't aware of this and so I was
like no you can come inside and like
just bring me a plate and we can eat
lunch together like in the cafeteria so
he comes up and he like brings new
chick-fil-a but I'm like oh don't walk
through the front door I'll just let you
in through the side doors like this
school so I let him and through like the
side door of the school and I like okay
everything's lit like it's great we're
in class eating our cheap flight
everyone's like snapchat again like you
know like you're here at school and I'm
like oh my gosh like this is so like I
don't know like I didn't know how I was
getting away with it right wrong so then
we go into the cafeteria and I'm like
okay let's eat like let's eat our lunch
whenever all of a sudden my friend types
maid she's like the security guards
looking for you and I'm like what and
she's like yeah he's looking for you
just giving our class something for you
so they saw on the cameras that I let
him into the school and so they're like
looking for him everywhere they're like
there's a kid from another school here
well what and I'm like oh my god what's
gonna happen so keep him like this is
like last semester this is my senior
year like I did this like recently and
so my administrator calls me and she
stops both of us as we're like trying to
run away like we were trying to sneak
out another door she stops us and I go
in her office my principal takes him and
she's like you're in trouble you're
being suspended you're like go home like
you're suspended and I'm like what and
so when you have to spend if you lose
your exemptions you don't get to exempt
a class and so I'm like oh my god like
are you getting any I got suspended like
I'm trying to exempt my classes or
whatever so while I think that's bad he
gets a ticket because it's considered
trespassing to come like to another
school like if you're not whatever it's
considered trespassing because he didn't
sign in he didn't feel like a visitor
badge nothing like that so yeah he gets
a ticket and God was just literally the
most horrible thing and I was like
this would have been so simple if you
just would have like a welcome to the
front like that's like you got a visitor
badge and like cave and brought me to
lunch but like no I'm trying to be
difficult and get around the rules and
like literally in any area of school
like I do this all the time I did this a
lot in school but like just listen just
follow the rules because there's always
consequences and there is no reason to
like make things harder than it is the
other thing is this is so weird for me
to be saying of all people but like get
off of your phone during school like
seriously I mean like I'm on my phone a
lot and like I know I'm like the number
one person like the last person who
should be saying this but it's really
not that hard
your teachers get so annoyed when you're
on your phone to like literally listen
for 45 minutes without checking Twitter
I know it's the hardest thing ever but
like get off your phone because what is
like what is that important it's still
gonna be like on your TL when you leave
class like when I was in sixth grade I
thought my phone taking up a lot you
like we're not a lot like in high school
it's a little bit easier you can like
have your phone your decimals in a music
why you do it well it's our school does
but I'm sixth grade you cannot have a
single phone out and like if someone
tells me not to do something that makes
you want to do it more and so I remember
in sixth grade like I you're not allowed
to even you can't even see a phone like
sitting there and I would always be on
my phone and so I got my phone taken up
twice before and you have to like pay to
get it back and so the third time I got
it taken up I go to the principal's
office because they're like this is the
third time you're getting written up you
got your phone taken up and I'm like
what the heck this is so annoying and I
go in and the principal of the we have
like a different principle that day she
was one of the other teachers because
our principal was gone so she like asked
another teacher in our school to be the
principal and the principal for that day
was like my fifth grade teacher who had
moved to the sixth grade school so she
had just had me in like fifth grade and
then she saw me and like coming in sixth
grade and she was like if you put your
phone taking up three times you have to
go to ISS so I assess it's in-school
suspension it's basically you sit in one
room and you just sit
you don't you're not allowed to talk
your knowledge is like look at anyone
you literally just sit there at a desk
all day for school like if that is your
school and she was like you have to go
to ISS and I remember going home and I
literally cried myself to sleep I fought
my mom so hard I was like I'm not going
it's good well I'm not going ISS like
I'm telling you right now I'm not going
ISS and I did and it was so miserable I
mean like I kind of liked ISS afterwards
because there was like really bad kids
in there and they would like start
acting up and I was kind of funny but
like no I would never want to go to ISS
get it was so boring but just stay off
your phone it's not that hard again just
follow the rules you know going along
with like setting up your phone just be
nice to your teachers because at the end
of the day like I know some of my
teachers very very well like they're
like my friends like I have like they're
like my friends literally so like no
tell me something like oh my gosh my
student to this day or like some teacher
will literally go home and cry about
stuff that your students do and I feel
so bad for them because at the same time
like your teachers are like just the
same as you like you know what I'm
saying like there are people too and
like you say like oh my God my did your
stuff supe don't know she's so annoying
but like they're really trying their
hardest like and I just feel so bad for
them so just be nice to your teachers
like you don't need to constantly pull
in them if they're saying something dumb
or they're being they're being rude or
something that giving you attitude they
think they're above and they're the
teacher in whatever just respect that
and don't talk back just be a normal
person meet on the other hand so a one
time in sixth grade this again I would I
don't know why I was so bad in sixth
grade but in six I was a bad student now
that I'm thinking of all these things
there was a teacher I did not like her
at all she was oh my gosh she was so bad
if I ask anyone from sixth grade they
will say like who's the worst teacher
like her like she was and I remember one
time we were on the track when we were
walking the track and there was a frog
and so my friend was like I'm gonna pick
up the Frog and I'm gonna bring it to
class and I was like oh my god we need
to put it on the teacher because like
does she needs to have a frog on her
she's so rude right so we picked this
frog up from the truck we stuff it and
like the front part of her backpack this
frog I know animal cruelty like shoot me
but we put this frog in the front of her
backpack we go to class we take the Frog
out it's living just it's still
breathing and we take the Frog out and
she wasn't in the class for some reason
like she had walked away so we're you
like take the middle part of the death
like where you put pencils and stuff of
like a teacher's esearch all kind of
talk comments on the pencil you get it
we put the Frog and we're like the
pencils would be like in the small part
so if she were to like open it I would
like come out or something so I put the
frog in there and everyone else is
sitting down the class and like me and
my friend are doing this really we're
gonna put the frog in there so they all
see us doing this and we're like and
don't like y'all don't tell like this is
gonna be so funny we put it in her desk
we walk and like we sit down she comes
in class and she like sits on the desk
and like 10 Reds in the class oh oh
that's what it was my friend the bell
rang but I had that teacher again next
period so she left and I was like I'll
tell you what happened so I'm sitting
there and all those kids who were in the
class left and so she's sitting there
ten minutes into the next class period
I'm sitting like oh my god that frog is
still in the desk and she opens the
pencil thing and it jumps out and it
doesn't land on her like sadly but it
jumps out and lands on the floor and so
she starts screaming and she's like why
I'm bagging my dad said ah and like of
course none of the kids know because
they're not the kids that were in there
like last year so only I like know that
like I did this and she's like like
Justin the kid I was in her class she
was like get this frog out so this kid
had to like pick up the Frog and like
put it outside and like sometimes I'm
just like what is wrong with you Pete
like why why are you stupid like why do
you do stuff like that
like she was probably like shivani went
home it was like like a wire my kids
hating me like I don't understand when
like I really didn't have to do that I
mean it's kind of a funny story to tell
now but like it'd just be nice to your
teachers because they did not need all
this extra like stuff in their life like
they don't need kids telling like
telling them every day like oh you're
stupid or like you're the worst teacher
ever like that's the profession is the
teacher so when you tell someone like
you're the worst teacher you're so dumb
you suck at your job like that's their
job like that like really hurts them
really bad
so just be nice to your teachers please
okay so the other thing is anything
embarrassing in school like get over it
like literally it does not matter three
months from then it will not matter what
you did like no one like literally no
one cares there's so many like
embarrassing things that like when you
think about that you get like red or
like you get really stressed thinking
about it like I'll bring it up to my
friends and no one even knows what I'm
talking about there are so many things
like there's something every single day
that's going on in school there's so
much drama and there's so much like
everything else like seriously if you
think it's the end of the world it's not
the end of the world like trust me
there's so many embarrassing things I've
done and I'm like I cannot live like I
literally can't go to school I'm
dropping out I'm moving like States like
I can't do this and no one even knows
what I'm talking about like I promise
you what you're like what's happening to
you right now whatever like drama is
like oh you can't sit at someone's lunch
table or like oh this friend thinks
you're annoying like trust me it doesn't
matter like literally like it none of it
matters and I just remember there was
one thing I always think about and it
was my freshman year so obviously I'm
like oh my god like I'm trying to be all
cute and I'm walking up these stairs in
our school and there's like a group of
like seven senior guys and they were so
cute like they were so cute and I
remember I was thinking about how cute
they were I missed a step on the stairs
and I just like fell and like caught
myself with my hands and I hit my shin
really hard in the stairs and I remember
like I cried about that I was so
embarrassed if I asked any one of those
seniors today and they literally would
not know what I was talking about like
they would be like oh like they do not
know like no one cares anything
embarrassing that you do like anything
that like anyone has ever sent you or
like you've said about some like oh
something happened with them and like
y'all my friends anymore this person
thinks oh my gosh we can't be friends
her nose is this her hair like this like
that does not matter like and literally
none of it matters and trust me it's my
senior year I'm like I can't even
remember what I ate for breakfast
yesterday like I don't remember any it
has
I've been sitting here oh it's not my
hair it's severe anyway I came from one
day for breakfast the other day like
much less any embarrassing thing no my
friends don't like it's fine you will
live the other thing that's super
important like if even if you're like
younger right now uhm
be careful what you put on the internet
because going on I've seen so many
people put so many like bad things on
the internet and like it follows you
like trust me about that so many people
like suspended from school or like God's
intention because they like tweeted
something inappropriate or appropriate
what kind of word was that um or like
I've just seen so many people put things
on social media that like they've gotten
like so much trouble like they've got
kicked off like full-on like teams for
like they've got kicked off like soccer
cheer or like anything like that like
just because they put something on the
internet it looks so bad and going into
college you really want to make sure
like none of your internet it's like
nothing that you put on the internet is
bad especially for me I know have a lot
of stuff on social media but I always
make sure I never have anything if you
think about it like if you wouldn't want
like your blog or a dad or like someone
that is trying to hire you if you
wouldn't want them to see it then just
like don't tweet it or like don't
retweet it or don't post it or don't say
anything that someone else like arguing
or like being rude on social media
because I trust me they check it and
like you don't think they do but they do
one time - I think this was last year
this is when I made a log of my school
day vlog which is like kind of the
reason I have not vlogs since that you
guys always ask me for like a longer day
at school but like no so one time I vlog
and in my blog I'm going to get I wanted
at school and I'm going to get
chick-fil-a with Jamil and some you are
going to get to play whatever I say it
in the vlog well my administrator pulls
me in like a few days later and he's
like err in trouble and I'm like why
he's like do you see this which he put
and he literally pulls up my youtube
channel is playing my blog and schooling
like what's going on and he's like you
left school and we got to play and I'm
like but like
I had a pass or whatever I was like I
had a pass and he's like then Jimmy I'll
have the pass and I was like no and he's
like you can't take another student off
campus like if they get if you get in a
car accident like the weird liable and I
was like I'm sorry bro like I am so
sorry I got detention for taking him off
campus and stuff like that and I'm just
like I never even thought that you would
watch that vlog like I never thought my
principal's watch my vlog or saw my
youtube channel or anything and like you
just have to be so careful what you put
because literally everyone is watching
you it's not just because I have like
subscribers like literally like your
teachers are watching you like everyone
has Twitter now all my teachers have
Twitter they see everything I put so
just keep that in mind next time you're
like retweeting like sexual things on
Twitter like don't be gross like
everyone sees it okay so the last thing
I have like just my overall like advice
to you guys it's just be nice to people
in high school I prom in high school in
six right and something at an elementary
school in any grade just be nice to
people because I promise you if you
aren't that person who's just like so
rude all time are always in a bad mood
like people will remember it like I
trust me there's so many stories like my
sister had like seeing people like out
of high school and they're like oh I
remember when you this and she's like I
don't remember that but like they
remember her being like nice to them or
like giving them a smile like stuff like
that and I feel like that is so so
important in any grade and like at any
time in your life it's just be nice to
people because they will remember that
down the road and like trust me it will
like and it will impact them and you
don't think it will this is the story
this one isn't like very funny this is
just like me genuinely like tell you
guys something and I feel like I wanted
to tell you guys all of these stories
and all these things about school and
like how I am just because I feel like I
want to get closer to you guys I want
you guys to like understand like my
point of view and like where I'm coming
from and just like understand more about
me and stuff so in elementary school
there was this girl in elementary school
and I'm telling you right now 100%
honest there is zero reason why I didn't
like her
I was in third fourth grade but I know
there was no reason I didn't like her I
was just like I don't like her like
whatever and so I remember like I would
I would always be rude to her
and I don't really remember like I
literally cannot remember why like
there's zero reason there is no reason
like I probably just hated myself and
was just like that person that was just
like rude and I remember being like so
rude to her like on the playground like
I would just like be like oh my god that
girl like I was like talking crap in
like 3rd and 4th grade like I was so
rude and I just like we remember being
like that so this girl I went to school
with her all through elementary school I
never really saw her and like six
seventh eighth grade never really was
around her nothing like that freshman
year I don't think I even saw her I
think she came back um my sophomore year
and I really don't know if she's
watching these videos maybe she was
watching these videos but I remember
like seeing her my sophomore year being
like oh my god like that's the girl like
I was so like I was like I believe her
like I was so rude to her in elementary
school like I can't believe she's at our
school again like I was I was like
scared of her because I was like I'm not
that person anymore like I feel so bad
right and so those are my thoughts so a
few days of her like coming back to our
school I'm like walking and there's like
this front desk and I'm walking up and
there's a girl there or she's there and
she's like hey ketta and I'm like hey
whatever and the girl next hair goes oh
you know her and she goes yeah she's my
elementary school bully remember that
and I'm oh my oh my gosh I remember
literally sitting there like yeah and
like I just kind of laughed it off and
was like it was like lol like what what
what are you saying
and I literally grabbed whenever I
needed at the front desk I ran I went
into the staircase and I started bawling
I called my mom and I was like she knows
I bullied her like she remembers that I
was so rude to her I feel so bad like I
want to give her a hug like and I
remember like I had like after that day
like I was like she like came up to me
just like hey can I get a ride home and
I was like yes like literally anything
you need girl like I got you because I
felt so like I felt so bad that I was so
rude to her for like litter
no reason and I was just like thinking
about it today because like lots of
stuff has just been going on and at the
end of high school and I just been
thinking about a lot of stuff and I was
just like it's so important to be nice
to people because later on down the road
like even when you leave high school
like you're not gonna see those people
again but like high schools the last
memories you're gonna have of some
people and like you never want those to
be negative or you never want to leave
like a negative view of like yourself on
someone you never want someone to think
so badly of you and like you leave off
like you graduate and then like when you
see them later in life like down the
road they're like oh yeah like my
freshman year she did this it's like
that's so awful so like just keep in
mind like the way you speak to people
and the way you treat people it's so so
important in high school and like I know
from personal experience like they
remember it they know and like it's just
just be nice like literally just be nice
it's not that hard I hope you guys like
this video I know it was like a little
bit different and I hope you guys like
videos like this because I kind of want
to like tell you more about my life I
don't know if I want to do story times
but I want to do like different things
I'm like stories about my life because
you guys probably did not know anything
that I just said like you probably did
not know like I was an awful student I
am an awful student like I got suspended
last semester or whatever but like I
just I want to share more of my life
with you guys I want you guys to like
get to know me better and if you like
these types of videos then comment in
the comments down below

things that you would tell other people
to do during high school just because I
don't know I feel like it's important
