to be a beauty haul and I have so many
hauls coming obviously if you guys
follow me on snapchat I was like showing
you that and has a trend while coming I
out for the week so you guys are new
please subscribe down below and hit that
bump you guys know what I'm talking
about videos coming and you guys care at
all to get going after this video
subscribe follow you know do all the
things so because I have so much in this
mansion you guys I'm just gonna hop
right into it I did use a lot of the new
products on my face today so I'm going
to be showing you guys which ones I use
so as I talked about a few products I
will have clips showing how I use them
and what I use it on that kind of stuff
so put this up right into it I did just
get back from LA and I went on like 10
of meetings and I got to go to a bunch
of the headquarters of a lot of
different places and so that is also I
have a ton of like boxes of things to
show you guys so the first thing we'll
start with is glam glow their office was
incredible and I am a huge fan of limbo
like there's already no I'm upset so the
first few things I got our two different
Maps so this is the grabby mud mask this
is the one that is silver in it like
peels off as one and it's amazing it's
probably my favorite Mac it's just it
firms your skin that's what it's for and
it just feels amazing and also I was
there she was telling me that you can
use it right before you do your makeup
so it gives you like a great lik base to
do your makeup I went to that was really
cool so I used that today and then my
other favorite one is need clearing
treatment this one is more of like a
tingling one I believe I can't remember
because I have so many glam glow masks
but I love this with a clearing
treatment and the gravity mud are
probably my two favorite then I got this
which I've never used this is the dream
duo this is the overnight transforming
cream so when you open it up to actually
have step one and step two two different
things and it has instructions on how to
use that I didn't get to use it but I'm
really excited just because everything
Glanville is amazing so the next two
things I got our lip products and this
are the this one is the Suzy a lip
exfoliating lip scrub so I haven't yet
to use this just because I was like I
want to actually try out at night
and it's obviously not nighttime right
now but today I used the glam glow pout
mud this is the wet let along treatment
and I believe they now have these and
like other pigments like nude and stuff
so actually looks really good but I put
this on I use chapstick anyway before I
put my lip product on so I use this at
work with my lipstick and everything on
today next to see it glam boiled off
kaznyk and this is a matte glow
moisturizer so you guys know I have like
the nude I don't remember what it's
called it's like nude it is a glowy and
moisturizer but this one is matte and I
use this as well today almost sounds
like a primer but not a primer I don't
know it's just awesome that's it right
there
it just melts on your skin it feels
amazing like seriously amazing and
moisturizes but it also makes you mad
it's weird it's cool and these last
thing which I've still come from this is
the glam glow glow setter and this is
makeup setting spray and I mean it's so
cute it's in this pink little bottle and
it smells really really good so I use it
today to set my makeup in I don't you
guys can see this with a mist on it like
you can just hear it's so nice like it's
just the perfect it's not like super wet
on your face it goes and it tastes good
cuz just what a mouth okay but that is
everything I got from Glenville now
moving on to Nick the first few things I
got are these jumbo eye pencils and I
love these I know lot people use these
and I want to try them out so the one I
used today is 611 in the shade yogurt
and it's like a rose gold kind of and I
really like these because you can use
them like they're really versatile so I
put this on like my the center of my leg
today but I also got this one and this
one it's called cottage cheese which is
a weird name color but it's white and I
think this would be really really pretty
to put on the inner corner and like
highlight your brow bone with that they
can also be all off English all over
shadows which i think is really cool and
I wanted to just blow in the mouth my
fingers so these are awesome and then I
got a primer this is the photo loving
primer this is the anti redness you guys
know I'm all about the anti redness
primers because I do have like more red
to just skin so this is amazing for me
I've used this before this ones it's not
a
next our three lipliner so I got this
one in the shade high standards this is
in the shade knock'em red and this is in
the shade revolution so this one is
green which that was really cool so like
how am I gonna wear this with my lips
but we'll see and I just really want to
route their lip liner because they're
amazing so it sixties up next product it
also used today this is their blush in
the shade intuition and I really like
NYX blush and I don't know I never use
this shade of one and I like the way it
looks on my cheeks right now I just
think it is like the perfect natural
kind of blush this is the intense butter
gloss this is I hear a lot about their
butter glosses oh and this one is called
cookie butter that makes me like want to
put it on right now I also got the mega
shine lip gloss and this is in a baby
Ruths which I'm super excited because on
says you see my lips right now I'm super
into lip gloss right now I didn't wear
this one today but I'm so pumped right
but I haven't seen it last thing from
NYX is the NYX wonder stick in so this
is a highlighting and contouring has a
contour end and it has a highlighting
end and this is in the shade in case
anyone's wondering medium to tan and I
use this today super blendable super
easy I think I like the contour shade a
bit more than I like the concealer side
just because I like to attack on
concealer so yeah next three at random
things I got these at Nick just because
they have like a little store in their
headquarters and so i just like pick
these up but i love these i got three
different shades these are the l'oreal
true match cushions and so the shade
that I'm actually loving right now is w
5.5 and I love the coverage of these I'm
more a different shade in the video that
is playing right now but that's what's
become super pale at the moment but I
bought this shadings I'm talking like
what are you doing so this is the shade
c8 and I have been using this to contour
look at how dark that is but basically I
just been putting my Beauty Blender and
I did
today but I just put the tip of my
newsletter in it and I blend it out and
so it is a foundation but because I got
this in such a dark shade I wanted to
see if I could use it as a contour like
a cream contour and it works perfect
it's obviously super blendable because
it's a foundation so I love this next
few things are from Dermalogica which I
love Doremon I'm so glad you guys know
me in my skincare I love trying out
skincare so the first thing I have is
the special cleansing gel from
Dermalogica I also got a Hydra blur
primer which I am so so pumped about I
also picked up the title replenish oil
which I heard is amazing put this on
after you take your makeup off and this
reinforces the skin's protective barrier
so this helps to replace protective
lipids depleted by aging and
environmental stress so this is going to
be amazing and then the last thing I
picked up is the pre cleanse so they're
like kind of steps that he's going to
use this and you can use the other
cleanser and all that kind of stuff but
this one is a deep cleansing oil and it
Motz your employee and clarity's and
purities and makeup so this one is like
oil that you can take your makeup off
with wit I can't talk today but anyway I
love oil that's the only way I take my
makeup on to me not can we not do this
today so that is what I got from Jimmy
logica now moving on to Smashbox so I
got so many primers guys like I don't
think you like understand so I got one
of each of their primers but I'm only
going to show you the two that I have
been using the most so I have been using
the photo finish foundation primer
hydrating and I have been using the
photo finish foundation primer in the
pore minimizing so I've been using these
two together I will moisturize my face
with it and I'll put this on my like
forehead my nose my chin stuff like that
places that I want to minimize my pores
so I love these together I'm so excited
to try out the other primers again they
also have a green one which me my green
I need to use it soon but I love love
love Smashbox primers and I just
in general also next to things from
Smashbox are some mascara so this
Pasillas Smashbox and decent exposure
and I really like that the lid is
velvety it's like velvet at the top but
I love the wanna actually love this
mascara it's super black which is
amazing and then I also got the Smashbox
halo highlighting laws and I didn't use
this today but I did use it the other
day and it's really cool because it just
has like this little like thing that you
can like PI later on I wonder if I could
show you it's so so pigmented but it's
like a brush and you can put on your
teeth or you can put this on before you
put your makeup I use it after I put my
makeup on I put this on and then I put
like a regular highlighter over it not a
liquid one and I love this I think this
is probably my new favorite thing from
Smashbox this is the fusion soft light
they in baked starburst so this is what
it looks like it's just like this around
so it's really really pretty and it's so
illuminating it has so many different
shades and so my favorite thing to do
right now is mix this with a bronzer but
on my cheeks because I like having a
really glowy look and this just gives a
perfect flow that it being like super
overpowering it's just a really pretty
bronzed glow and then the last thing you
guys already know I have these Smashbox
photo finish primer water everyone uses
this it's amazing I've been using it I
love primer waters I have like 12 in my
drawer it's ridiculous but I love the
Smashbox ones for sure the next two
items are super random the first one is
from bite cosmetics with this the lip
pencil and I just want to show you guys
need a lip pencil really quickly because
they're super pigmented and they're
really really creamy like I wasn't
expecting that when I got some sent to
me I was like wait I actually love these
so my cosmetics has really good lip
pencils and I also about two different
lip colors I got them in the shade
pepper and nori pepper it's just like a
really pretty ma be like red I don't
even know how to describe that and then
um nori is dark they're just like a dark
lipstick which I love to pretty like
fall but going along with the lips I
picked up the Urban Decay lip liner and
naked too I used to wear this every
single day I wore it today because I was
like I missed
kleiner and I also paired it with the
buxom full-on lip polish and I've been
wanting a clear lip gloss for so long
this also has like this definite that
makes your lips like bigger throughout
the day it makes them like single which
is awesome because who doesn't want big
lips so I paired these together next
thing I don't even need to go into depth
about this this is the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills glow kiss by nicole
Guerrero if you guys haven't got this or
even heard about it
what are you doing look at these shades
I'm wearing the highlight today I mixed
a glow Gator and forever lit oh my god
guys I mean they're seriously amazing
I'm not even just saying that they're
bomb okay my caramel just out for some
reason but I only have two or five so
you guys go these are probably like now
going to be a Holy Grail product for me
I just bought two of the outer last
stick foundations because everyone's
talking about them and I was like why
are they so amazing like what's the
point so I bought them in the shade
alabaster and I also bought the shade
beige which are two completely different
shades but one is for when I have a
spray can and one is for when I don't
that's how amazing they are look at the
difference in the shades but they are so
bomb I'm honestly guys like if you have
not tried the foundation I highly
recommend it is so so blendable I always
used to like be scared of stick
foundations until I bought these and now
I'm like stick foundations are amazing
these are amazing
so blendable and you can work the
coverage up it's just like I don't
notice everything I've ever wanted
Foundation and then you have so many
different shades so definitely try
hourglass I bought these and I love step
so that is it for my megapolis last
