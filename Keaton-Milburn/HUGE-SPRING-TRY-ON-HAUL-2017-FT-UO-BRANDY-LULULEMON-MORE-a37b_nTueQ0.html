to be a try on haul and you guys to
understand how long I have had all these
clubs I've been like saving about this
because I want to do one big try on haul
first of all if you guys are new here
please hit the subscribe button if you
guys like this video and I am also doing
a outfit of the week video featuring all
of these clothes you guys want to know
how I style any of them or how I wore
any of them I'm doing an outfit of the
week which is coming out really soon so
you want to subscribe and hit the bell
so you noticed I weren't posting and it
was out for their news let's get in so
so first thing mister guys is from the
Kylie shop and I'm not gonna lie guys I
do regret buying these just because it's
like I got really excited that they were
yellow and I was like I have to buy them
they're from Kylie and they're yellow
duh and then now I'm like I'm never
going to wear this I have a tracksuit
now that says dick in like I am NOT
thing like whatsoever so like this has
no relevance to my life so I got the
mustard sweatshirt which says thick on
it which is actually so comfortable I
will say both of these items are really
really comfortable super soft like I
want to sleep in them and wear them
every day but I don't because again you
know I was all in Arizona and it's about
95 degrees outside right now so these
are no longer an option for me so I
bought these for no reason
the next item guys may have seen in my
February favorites I mentioned it
briefly
it is this Big Sean t-shirt this was
from a new album I decided I also bought
this particular and because Big Sean's
loved my life actually likes that it
goes into a really pretty ombre and it
has like the words on the back I just
thought it was really cute is I want it
by his merch so I bought that the next
item looks really random
it is a choker into this with denim
black choker I saw this at Sorel which
you've grows in LA and I just really
wanted I've always wanted a choker like
this and so while I was there just
figured I would buy this the next item
is from Topshop and I wanted to try out
light wash denim so this is the light
wash pair of denim and like the Jamie
style jeans which you guys know are the
jeans that I always always wear they
have like they're dark and they have the
holes in the knees and I wanted to get
some that don't have Kohl's they just
look like super super simple so I got
these guys I've actually been loving
them and I used to never like light wash
but I think I'm into it now so the next
two items are from Zara so you guys also
probably sauce on my Instagram the
it's just a black and red stripe like if
I want to say a turn left because it's
not a full turtleneck but it does have a
higher neck and its ends are like
ruffled which I thought was really cute
and I thought this would be adorable for
it Disneyland so that is why I
specifically bought the shirt for this
man but I also just think it's really
cute and it was $10 at Zara and I know
they have these and a bunch of other
colors like just plain black and white
and so I think I'm going to go back and
get a few of them in a different color
and then the next thing I got is our our
this pair of jeans and this is a size 6
if you guys are wondering what size of a
my nose our sizing is a little bit
different but I am in love with these
guys I know that's the end of jeans like
being all frayed and like really really
cute I don't know I just think that's
like a trend right now I really want to
get a pair of jeans that were like that
and that are also high waist and it fit
me really well so when I found these as
our I was like oh yes please these next
two items are from princess Polly so the
first item is a bodysuit and it looks a
bit scandalous I understand I know what
you're thinking mom why did you buy that
but I thought this would be really
really cute into summer and spring
because it's white and when you're tan I
think this would look so pretty when you
can like see your skin kind of through
it like really tan with white and I love
bodysuit and I think this would be so
cute under like jean shorts jeans like
just put plain jeans I think that would
be really cute though I'm excited to
style this bodysuit and like a bunch of
different ways and then to kind of go
with that
I found these a pair of jean shorts on
the website and they're super frayed and
I just like they're a perfect fit for me
which is really hard to find like good
jean shorts which is why I was like
looking everywhere to find some that
would fit me the only thing I will say
about these is that the button is kind
of falling off on the front and I
haven't even worn them yet like it's one
of those that it's like it's really like
you feel like you can hear it it's like
really Wiggly and it might go off before
I wear them so I'm going to hope not but
that's the only thing I would say about
these although I do really like the fit
of them the next door is brandy melville
so the first thing I'm showing you guys
is this silver star necklace and I just
thought this would be really simple to
layers you guys will see later I bought
a bunch of necklaces just because I've
been needing a lot more jewelry recently
and like I just wanted to like layer
bunch of stuff so and then I don't know
why I could not
these pants from brandy they're like
lounge pants but I have it like bralette
from them in the same material and it's
so comfy so my favorite thing has been
like basically looking like a boy so I
bought these sweatpants from brandy
melville when I was in New York and now
my favorite thing ever
is wearing these sweatpants with an
oversized hoodie and like tennis shoes
and I literally look like a boy but I'm
the most comfortable I've ever been
it's like my favorite grocery shopping
outfit like I love putting new
sweatpants on with an oversized t-shirt
and like literally looking like a man
and it's just the best it's the best
feeling and the last thing for Brady you
guys know I couldn't resist and it's a
yellow long-sleeved she doesn't use my
channel yellow is obviously my favorite
color and if it's yellow I buy it so I
bought this and this is really comfy and
I've been sleeping this almost every
single night which is why it's pretty
dirty already which means I'm going to
wash it maybe next we're moving on to
its Urban Outfitters which is like this
is like where all my money goes this is
how I end up broke because I go to urban
outfitter so the first thing I got our
two necklaces so I got a gold one and a
silver one they were having a two for 20
and I was like oh yes you know you
already got me so I bought this one
which this has little stars on it and I
bought one that's just like then and I
don't know I just
again needed a lot of necklaces for
layering I just think dainty necklaces
right now or super like in so I want to
get a few of those that also probably
sell us on the Instagram but this is a
emerald green jumpsuit and actually
about this when I was in LA because I
needed an outfit to wear to something
and I didn't have one so I was like you
know what I really like to jump suit and
I think green if you guys have blonde
hair and blue eyes even if you have like
brown eyes and brown hair like I just
think this color green looks good on
everyone I think it like brings out I
don't know what it is but I just think
it looks good on everyone so that's why
I bought this and it's just satin and
soft and comfy you guys are going to be
like why did you buy that but I'm going
to try and justify I'm going to try a
dress place so I bought this top from
Urban Outfitters and it is full-on
sequin the back is open it's like
crisscross it's really pretty and this
was on sale and I want to trade omelets
just because I was like Noah it's
different might be fun
and I want
I try to honor that you know what I
think this could actually be really cute
I think this would be really pretty with
a pair of like dark high-waisted jeans
and like new fields or you could like go
all out and like wear like a different
pattern skirt with like sequin top I
don't know I just think there's so many
different ways to style this and I like
getting pieces that are out of my
comfort zone so when I found this I was
like you know what do you keep do you it
next thing from Urban is this slip dress
and this is like I was I want a rose
gold because like that's what this dress
kind of reminds me of this is like a
rose gold color really pretty a helpless
in the dark agree and like black version
but then when I saw this I thought this
would be a lot prettier for summer and
spring so I wanted to buy this and style
it and the last thing is this champion
hoodie and I actually got this from my
mom for Valentine's Day so um no man
bought me this round pens day definitely
my mom I am very single oh this is my
honey my mom got me and it's really
comfy I wanted it enlarged because I
wanted to literally go down to my knees
and that is exactly what does moving on
to a boutique that's actually in Phoenix
but they do have an online shop I will
make a list them down below now you guys
are wondering I posted a picture in this
and this is the black set that I wore
and a lot of you guys are wondering
where I got it it's back to from PETA
mooing I don't know if that's how you
pronounce the name of the boutiques I'll
link it down below I just think this is
really really cute perfect for summer
you guys are going to see like body
suits sets and rompers are like perfect
for me for summer and spring I just
think those are such easy items to pair
and like just look so simple so I got
this set the next thing I got was this
white bodysuit and I liked this because
I liked at the top of it it's just like
straight and I also like that the
sleeves of it tie which is really cute
to me I just thought that was different
and it's white and I'm going to retain
them somewhere and a spring and it's
going to see I'm gonna I'm gonna
oh my that was good I promise good the
last thing I got from there is this
romper I also posted a picture on my
Instagram with this and you guys doing
where is that from and it's also some
beautiful and W teak and I just think
this is so so pretty looking at it on
like the rack I wasn't like sold on it
and then I tried it on like the off the
shoulder the ruffle
the sleeves everything looks really good
so I love this next things are from
PacSun so I just got this bathing suit
and this is like eight pastel pink
looking bathing suits so this is I got
the top and the bottom I am a size
medium in the top and small on the
bottom if you guys are wondering and I
just thought this is cute I never find
anything seems ever so the last thing
about some packs done is this and this
is a adidas long sleep I know if you
find like hoodies and long season stuff
and it's so hot outside but I love
wearing adidas like especially
turtleneck adidas I love wearing this
over top of like workout clothes and I'm
going to the gym and like taking it off
and wearing regular I don't know like
workout apparel is probably my favorite
thing to wear right now speaking of
workout apparel because I am like self
it nowadays like just kidding I've been
going to the gym a lot more I don't have
a Nicki Minaj booty at this point and I
don't have this expected but we are
going to get there guys the glow up is
coming I went to Anna lemon and I bought
a few things so about two tops the first
off is just this white cropped top if
you guys want to know the name it's the
Kate's crop tee I know like all the
names and they're a little bit confusing
but I got this is because I needed a
white top I didn't have like a white
crop top to wear next I got this muscle
tee and this is grey I can only wear
like cropped tops to the gym because I
just watch lists a big t-shirt I have to
wear a sports bra or crosswalk or
something so I bought this and all of
the clothes are super light because
never bought anything for the lemon
they're super super light and such a
good material to work out okay so if you
guys are listening to enter the rest
video and you guys like don't care about
me listen to this so this is the best
grade leggings I have ever bought in my
life so I bought two pair of these
leggings the type of leggings that they
are because they come in other colors in
this is the wonder under legging and
they are amazing the best leggings I've
ever one of my life I have them in black
and so I just went and I bought them in
maroon and then they um break out it's
like a gray or like light maroon shade I
don't know I just love the fit of these
the next pair of leggings also wonder
under are not everyone's cup of tea but
they are this bright green color and I
these guys I absolutely love these I
think they make you look so tan again
with like the green I'm really
integrating I feel like green is like my
color my prom dress is literally this
color I just like green and so that's
why I bought these and I think they look
cute I just have myself my face with
this we're going to put some at it map
itself moving on the last pair of
leggings of Awesome lilou are these and
these are the going slow crop or
something like that I'll list the name
but they're so comfortable as well and
they're super super tight at the waist
they go super high up which is also I
really like because if I'm going to wear
like a sports bra or a really cropped
t-shirt to the gym I'm not going to wear
low-rise leggings I have to wear
high-rise I just don't want that much on
my stomach out so that's why I wear
these and they're super comfortable and
they hold everything in while you're
working out all if you guys are
wondering I'm a size 6 and all leggings
and I'm normally like a size 2 or 4 and
Jean so that is helping you with sizing
I know sizing is like difficult so I try
and include the sizes of my leggings and
like pants and subs you guys get an idea
okay so the next things are from forever
21 these glasses you guys have been
commenting about and asking about for
forever I'm just going to try them on
right here because they're really cute
and they're like orange yellow and I
just thought they were really pretty I
didn't have any tinted glasses and they
were like five dollars from forever 21
so gone on a budget people I also bought
a backpack from forever 21 this is it
it's just plain leather I have been
meeting a small backpack to go around
with all the time I have like my baby
Louboutin but it's just too much
sometimes and I mentioned that I want to
small backpack so I don't this so I
bought three necklaces from forever 21
that you know they're cheap but we're
going to make some work so the first one
is literally just this really small thin
silver chain I wanted a choker that I
can wear like almost every single day so
I found this and I was like this goes
with everything I can wear this every
day of my life so I bought this one and
then the next one I bought is this
really thick like silver choker which
has rhinestones on it it's also black
and I thought this would go girls like a
more edgy look if I'm wearing all black
and like not much jewelry but then just
have this choker on I thought that would
look really cool and I've been eating a
gold choker for
a while so I bought this one just
because it's super simple I don't want
any Joker's that had patterns or
anything on them because I'm not really
looking for that I just needed staple
chokers if you guys made it to the end
of this video you guys are amazing for
actually sitting through all this and
looking at all the clothes that have two
guys I promise I am uploading a outfit

the items in this haul so if you guys
