but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be my massive spring try and haul I
have been waiting so long to film this
video literally if you guys have been
subscribed to this channel for a while
you know the last tried all I did was
seriously forever ago or at least it
feels like forever ago
and I just ordered so many clothes and
I've been waiting for so much to come in
that I'm finally so excited to show it
all to you guys if this is your first
video if my don't forget to subscribe it
would mean so much me I have so much
more fun content coming this summer I'm
just like I've been on like a filming
kick and I just am so excited what's up
for you guys
so thumb we're talking to where I have a
lot of clothes I'm just gonna get right
into it first I'm gonna start with
everything that I got from dope which is
majority of this video so before you
guys get like oh my gosh dough I don't
know what that is I don't have that it
is a shopping app I will link mine down
below I will list my username down below
you guys can go follow me I have so many
different little like folders or
categories but they call it list I have
so many different lists that you guys
can go look at I have like my staple
items is my hotel list my favorites list
it's a bunch of things that I have
ordered and things that I am wanting to
order on there so if you guys want you
guys can go follow me on my don't list
they actually send me a few pieces for
this video and then literally the rest
of it I was like yeah I'm obsessed with
this app and I'm just gonna keep
ordering stuff so that's nice videos
taking so long because I kept ordering
things on dough and then I would have to
wait for them to come in the mail so
it's just a process you guys can use the
code Keaton to get five dollars off your
purchase it would mean so much me if you
guys use my code if you guys went follow
me on there because I just feel like
it's another platform that I can connect
with you guys with and you guys can see
what like outfit inspiration I'm looking
at before I like buy it and before I
like post it on Instagram and stuff like
that start off from dote I have this
body suit I'm wearing it right now I got
three body suits off of dope so this was
just an army green color it is from
urban I absolutely love this one the
only thing I will say is that I don't
like that the straps are so big like you
can see on my body they were just really
really loose like if I even like shrug a
little bit they're really loose and they
fall off but I mean I will go through
that just so I can wear this because I
really really like it and I love the
material of it so I also bought it in
lavender so I love the lavender one I
feel like this will make me look really
tan and this brings
lavenders are really fun spring color
because it's not the usual like pink and
yellow I feel like lavender is really
good for the spring and then this one is
this same material it's just striped I'm
so excited to play this I think I want
to wear this at Coachella or like a day
before Coachella day right like
somewhere where I'm at Coachella I love
love love this next up I got these shoes
and these are known for everybody like
honestly they're not they're not even
for me but I was like I need Coachella
shoes and I need to look like sincerely
jewels basically so I bought these
platform like what are they they're like
the woman like I don't know like picnic
whatever is there's something like that
anyway I bought these platform sandals
they're actually really really
comfortable and because they have such a
thick sole it's like not that hard to
walk in it's not like a heel they're so
comfortable I cannot wait to wear the
stick which I'm gonna wear them like
every single day because they're just
really really good Coachella shoes and I
don't know if I'll ever wear them really
again so if they get messed up I don't
really care but these are also off of
urban awesome dope
the next item don't send me are these
these are the Nike Air Force ones I have
a wanting these for so long and you can
obviously tell like ever since I got
them I've worn them every single day I'm
not kidding like I actually need help I
need to wear other shoes I used some of
my bands all the time but now that I
have these they're the holey shoes that
I wear and they're so broken in and
they're just like they're such a staple
like they're just perfect if you don't
have these I don't know what white shoes
I was wearing before this next up is
this top this is actually from Free
People if you guys probably saw I added
it to my Coachella list on dope because
I was like thinking about wearing it to
Coachella and then I finally was just
like you know what you need to get it so
I ordered it I probably wear to go chela
it's just really cute and also I don't
really know how the straps are supposed
to be I feel like you can wear them up
or you can wear them off the shoulder
just depending on like your vibe I kind
of like it more off the shoulder but it
just really depends on what you like I
just feel like it looks so like dainty
and girly and I don't have anything like
it next is this jacket it is a cropped
jean jacket from Topshop I have been
wanting a cropped jean jacket for so
long I wanted a black denim one because
I have a jean jacket but I don't have a
black jacket that I can always wear so I
really really wanted this one this is
also a staple I just feel like everyone
needs this they also sell this in like
the regular denim color on top shop but
I just
really wanted a black one and I think
the crop is perfect this is the perfect
amount of crop next up is another
bodysuit I am in love with this one this
is from pretty little thing yeah and I
just saw this on Instagram and I was
like oh my god that's so cute this
girl's wearing and I was like I need
that so I literally automatically went
to dope searched it and they had it so I
was like I'm getting this right now it's
velvet and it has extract so I feel like
stripes like vertical sharps make you
look a lot smaller than make you look
slimmer so I love this and I feel like
it's just a good piece to style next up
is this off the shoulder of black top
this is from urban I'm really into
off-the-shoulder right now I also feel
like there's a lot of off the shoulder
tops being so not off the shoulder but
like one shoulder I don't know why I
love this but I really like this one it
is from urban and it's just really soft
and this is another top that's just like
really basic but you can wear it with
like a bunch of different things you can
wear an all-black outfit to dinner or
you could wear this with like denim and
like jean shorts or something like that
and like dress it down I think it's
really cute next up is another bodysuit
this one is very lingerie as which I
know a lot of people have like different
ideas people style these all the time
like out in public you can wear this
with like high-rise jeans jeans shorts
which I absolutely love that look this
might not be for everybody so I ordered
this off of resolve I think it's andö I
will link it on below I'm gonna have a
folder on go and it's gonna be
everything that's in this hall will be
on the folder so you guys can just
literally go click it and then go
through everything add it to your card
if you guys want to buy it and then use
Eaton's to get five dollars off but
anyway so I got this bodysuit the only
thing that I don't like is that it has
this like wire in the boot and my boobs
aren't this big which I'd like I don't
know I guess I thought that they were
but they're not that big so it kind of
like hangs off on the side like it's
it's a shape of a big boob but like a
small move is in it so it just like
doesn't look right I got a small so I
don't know maybe that I should get extra
small next up is this dress I think this
is off of princess Polly I love this if
you guys watched my Easter blog I was
gonna wear this on Easter but the button
on the top was like not fitting around
my boob and I
thing looks like it's literally on fire
outside I'm not kidding anyway the
button at the top didn't go like over my
boob so I was like okay yeah I'm not
going to wear the Ceasar Sunday but it
is a really really pretty dress I feel
like this is like prime example of
spring clothing like I love the
all-white it has like the little like
lacy detailing on it just looks so
spring and I feel like this with like
little like light blue heels or like
light pink like accessories something
like that would be so pretty next up is
this jumpsuit it is an off-the-shoulder
polka dot jumpsuit I post a picture with
this on my Instagram because I
absolutely love it it's so comfortable
and it's just very very simple again I
love like obviously as you can tell like
one color pieces like rarely do I get
things that are normally polka dot but
because it's black and white I think
it's so cute and it just is really
comfortable has pockets so I love love
love this so that is all of the items
that I got off of doh again if you guys
want to shop any of the items in this
haul I will leave them all on the don't
app and you guys can just go and shop
use my code if you guys want to
it's super fun it's honestly such a fun
app I'm not even just saying this
because they're so nice to me but it's
just literally an amazing app and I use
it constantly like I wake up and shop on
do't so if you guys want you guys can go
follow me on there and yeah I'll have
all the clothes listed these next items
I'm so obsessed with like they are the
epitome of spring also I forgot to
mention yeah this nail is broke off like
literally it's it's broken like I don't
talk about it I understand ratchet I
can't help it like I can't change this
by myself
yes I'm gonna go get it fixed but just
not right now okay anyway these next
items are so spring to me they're from a
shop here in Arizona but they have an
online store it's called meet Amul and
I've mentioned them tons of times in my
older Tran hauls but I just absolutely
love them I love love love going into
their store it's so cute here um so the
first thing is this dress this I posted
on Instagram and everyone was like oh my
God where is this dress from it's so
cute
this color green I think pastels for
spring are super fun they also make you
look really really tan I just feel like
this is such a spring dress it has
little flowers on ix you look super
super slim I'm just obsessed with this
dress and I was obsessed
the color I feel like I want to get a
lot more things this color if they had a
bodysuit like this in this color I would
probably want it I would probably need
it next is this one-shoulder I was going
to say off-the-shoulder it's one
shoulder top I also posted this on my
Instagram if you guys aren't already
following me on there that's where you
should be following me because you guys
see all these clothes before I showed
them in the hall but I love this you
guys know yellow is my favorite color
and I just love how girly this looks
I've been trying to go for a little bit
more of a girly feel not so like all
black like emo like I've been trying to
like give myself some color
I keep like flinging clothes and I feel
like this candle is gonna like set them
on fire
next up going with the whole girly thing
I have this dress it is a light blue
again it's like a pastel blue I love
that this has like a little detailing on
the arm it looks like hell before live
and Lemmons dresses look but I
absolutely love this super girly has
frills on the bottom of it it ties out
the way so it makes you look like slim
this would like a white Brella
underneath I think is so pretty so I'm
very very excited to wear this to like I
don't know it's like also because like a
wedding I don't have a wedding to go to
I don't even know why I just said that
but I feel like this would be good for a
wedding if you guys are going to like a
springtime wedding this is just really
really cute so love this these last two
things are a set so the top is just this
off the shoulder a white frilly talk
which i think is perfect even if you
didn't wear it with the matching pants I
feel like this is just cute with jeans
with jean shorts with a skirt with a
denim skirt anything I feel like
everyone needs like at least one
off-the-shoulder white top it's just
like crucial and then the pants are so
comfortable and I am obsessed with them
they're like trouser pants they're super
big they're wide leg definitely wearing
these to Coachella one of the days I've
already like planned my outfit with this
but I love these I'm obsessed I love
that they tired the waist and I really
love this as a set as well but it's good
that they're like white cuz you can wear
these with different things
okay this set I am obsessed with like
obsessed I feel like this is so good for
like me like this is me in an outfit
this bright like mustard yellow set it
has the top and the pants these are both
from tiger miss I saw these and I was
like there is no way I am NOT buying
these I absolutely love it definitely
also want to bring this to Coachella
weekend just so I can get pictures in it
because I absolutely love it makes you
look so tan and the material is knit if
that makes sense so it's like literally
you can like see through it it's knit
it's really thick but it's super super
comfortable and like lightweight so I
love this like I I can't wait the amount
of pictures I'm probably gonna post in
this is unhealthy
I've already know okay so this last item
I don't even know why about this
honestly I have no idea why I bought
this I just looked really really pretty
and I was like maybe I'll wear it one
day it took like something fancy I have
nothing coming up that's like fancy that
I could wear this to but I was like I'm
gonna wear it anyway it is again another
like one shoulder top so like this is
the top and this is like the dress so it
is a dress but it's like attached if
that makes sense you guys can see the
Dragon Hall that it shows like your
stomach so it's just one shoulder I love
this I love the color of it it fits so
freakin well I'm pretty sure I don't
know what size I got I know it's like
Australian sizes because this is also
from tiger myth so it might be like a 2
or something but I'll link it down below
so you guys can go find it but I love
this the material of it is so so nice if
you guys have like any for moles or
anything coming up I would highly
recommend going on Tiger mice and
finding little ones like this because
they have this and like so many other
dresses on there so love that so that is
everything that I have for my trying
haul I hope you guys liked I'm so
excited to see all these pieces you guys
