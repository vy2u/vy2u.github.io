different packages over like the past
few weeks and I've just waited for all
of them to come in so hopefully this is
good also I just got done with a photo
shoot which is why my hair is so big so
if any of you guys are asking for hair
tutorial I wish I could tell you but I
had a hair stylist do in here so I have
no idea how to do this but I was like
I'm going to keep my hair like this for

a lookbook with a few of the pieces that
are in the chyme hall just to show you

want to please hit that subscribe button
and give it a thumbs up and without me
talking anymore listen into the video so
I'm gonna start off with my favorite
items first because I'm like too excited
to get into the rest of the haul I just
want to like start with it so these
items are from Lulu so thank you to
those for sending me these I absolutely
love those literally that's not even a
try and haul of my eyes I don't have
loose clothes in it like I absolutely
love this clothes so I will link all the
items down below and like when I save
these pieces that I'm going to show you
are like my favorite from the whole haul
like they literally are I'm going to LA
tomorrow and I just can't wait to pack
these clothes and like wear them around
and let's be really cute so anyway let's
get into it so the first thing is this
scarf and it is a like star
scarf it sort of an really cute for
fourth of July but I think it's really
cute anyway you guys know I love wearing
B and Anna's and I love wearing like
headbands on her hair wrap and I thought
this would just be a really really cute
like head wrap kind of like this like I
just saw this really cute obviously not
with this shirt but I just think there's
so many different ways to style it and
you can wear it like around your neck
and my hair is literally so big I don't
need no students but I hope this was a
really really cute and I just like
things like this because I like to style
them a lot of different ways the next
thing is sunglasses so I thought these
were really really cool they're just
like grey sunglasses it
I just thought they were really cool and
I broke my other sunglasses the red ones
that were like my favorite eye bracelet
lately every pair of sunglass so I got
these because I was like I really really
need it there and I just like them I'm
going to part my hair this way because I
feel like I look weird next thing is a
skirt so this is just a white denim
skirt I have just been needing a skirt
like this and if you guys are wondering
I got a phase medium and it fits really
really well I absolutely love that it
makes you look so freakin can't because
it's so white so I just needed a white
gym skirt and this is really cute with
plotting shoots or cross off to like
anything like that so I figure out if
this next is this dress so this is so so
pretty I love high neck dresses on me
which is has like a little time you tie
it in the back it's open back and I just
liked it it's like a black with red
these look like little flowers I think
that's what they aren't had like
embroidery on the top and I was looking
for a high-neck dress that I could wear
this just kind of like a sundress but a
little bit like nicer so I really really
liked this for that okay so I've been
really wanting to get a polkadot shirt
so this one is just a red polkadot shirt
and I think polka weird poke polka dot
pull polka dot okay polka dot polka dot
anyways this is the sort that I got I
like that it has like loose sleeves and
I just really really like the red
because red looks really really good
with my hair color for some reason so I
figured I would get this I thought it
was really very pretty tucked into like
some blue high-waisted jeans I thought
that would be so cute so I just figured
this was really pretty for summer okay
guys this has to be my favorite piece
from the whole thing so this is a huge
blue oversized t-shirt so it has really
really long sleeves and they're super
flowy and I got this in a size small but
it's still oversized because I chose
like how it's supposed to look and I
think this is so so pretty one because
it's light you can still wear it in the
summer even if it's hot I know it's
long-sleeve it's flowy and it feels
breezy and then I just really like it
tucked into like low-rise jeans or
low-rise shorts something like that I
think this is really cute to style with
like tons of jewelry I don't know why I
absolutely love this pattern
and I just think it's beautiful next is
is romper so this is really really
pretty it's just a little floral romper
I got it in like a white version I feel
like to have it another color I'm not
sure but I got it in white because it
makes me look really really tan in the
summer which I am all about you guys
know me and my experience I always want
to choose things that make me look like
the darkest possible so I love all of
this romper and for some reason the
material on it is so so soft like I
thought thank God are these pair of
heels so these are so freakin cute
they're black like lace-up heels and
they're not too too high so it will
really hurt your feet and I've been
wanting a pair of these I also want them
in tan by I figured out Sarah was black
because I want to see how much I like
them which already love them is I'm
probably about to get them in time but
they're just really really pretty I
think they're really good for like if
you want to wear like a jean skirt but
you don't want to wear super high heels
these are like the perfect heels to wear
with that so I absolutely love these and
they're velvet which is really really
cool thank you again so much to Luis I
absolutely love these clothes like these
are such the perfect summer clothes for
me like I literally can't wait till
understand so I will link all their
clothing down below you guys go follow
them on social media
and go check out their pictures with so
many awesome summer items right now on
their website so I will link everything
down below don't forget to go click that
moving on I only got one thing from
Topshop but I want to put them in here
because I'm obsessed so it is these
light wash pair of jeans and I
absolutely love Topshop jeans like I
normally wears are jeans which I also
love Zara teens but I really liked the
way that these looked on me guys can
obviously see they're just super
high-waisted super tight girls are
wondering I'm a 26 / 32 and these are
the Jamie style jeans so I also really
like these because at the end they just
have a little bit of like the distressed
look to them which I really really like
it's not too much it's just like a
subtle distress meant that make sense
next thing I got this from a pretty
little thing online actually ordered two
other think that ordered of black denim
skirt but it didn't really fit me very
well I'm gonna have to return it but I
got this crop top and the sleeves are
flames which I just thought was so cool
because I'm always looking for a black
crop top and the material Chris I
thought it was going to be like clogged
when it came in the mail but it's
actually just like really really thin
which I like so much better because I
won't be sweating so I think this is
gonna be really fun to style because
it's so simple
okay so the next thing is from PacSun it
it's actually a men's t-shirt so I got
this in an Excel O's on sale so that's
the only reason I bought it but I just
like that I had two tigers on the front
of it and I figured I could wear it with
either those like lace-up heels that I
got from Lulu's because this is like the
perfect thing to wear that with it's
like the Lulu's lace appeals and then
like an oversized t-shirt or something
like that it's like casual but dressy so
I got this it is a button-up and it is
men's but it was really really cute
oversized like the shorts entities that
you can barely see the next two things
are from Zara so this first thing is a
Dennis car I did not realize how they
done skirts and like showing I only show
two but I bought another one so anyway
this is just a denim skirt from Zara it
has all these floral like embroideries I
also accidentally ripped it right here
it kind of looks like it was supposed to
be a little distressed there was already
over there but I just like roasted a lot
more than I'm supposed to be but they
have so many skirts like this that our
ads are like so many different patterns
of the embroidery so if you guys are
looking for a turn like this
Zara is the place to go because there
was so many with so many different
patterns oh wow this is perfect
the next thing from Zara is this yellow
t-shirt is almost like a yellowy orange
I think this is orange I just thought
this was so cool it was on sale Anna is
like wow I think this would be really
cute with just jeans like I like shirts
like this that are simple but you don't
have to do much when you wear with them
like I will add jewelry to this nothing
special with the shoes I just think like
shirts like this I got this from Zara
okay so now all of these items are Urban
Outfitters also the shirt that I'm
wearing right now is from Urban
Outfitters
I wear this to Coachella and literally
how it worn it since I was like you know
what I - also my video and so these are
the my favorite pair of jean shorts all
summer they're low-rise and I
never wear low-rise jeans because I just
feel like it looks so weird in there but
when I found you I was like these are
the perfect low-rise it for me so their
beauty G denim I believe and I just
really like the color of them I like
that they go high up on the sides but
then they go back down and like cover my
butt in the back so I just thought these
are really really cute for summer
especially with different crop tops and
things like that the next thing is this
mesh just long fishnet it's a fishnet or
mesh I'm not really sure but I bought
this because I thought this would look
really really cool underneath a graphic
t-shirt I thought this would be cool
layered underneath it feels like a short
please when you see like the mesh
underneath I thought this would look
super super cool I'm not really sure how
to style this yet so that's why I didn't
try it on but I just bought it so that I
can find different ways to wear it
next thing is this oversized blue
t-shirt I just thought the colors were
so so pretty illness especially the blue
and it's a ocean keep it clean 90% water
which I thought was kind of cool too and
then I just wanted to wear it oversized
like with either low-rise jeans or just
I don't know I like oversized t-shirts
you guys know I literally just wear like
old vintage tees all the time so I
thought this was really really cool
absolute just did a photo shoot in this
with the glasses I'm about to show you
guys and it looked really nice together
these are the glasses I did need photo
shoot with I did it with that ocean
shirt and they're just really cool like
how these are so cool and I honestly
felt them for photoshoot purposes I feel
like I was honestly wouldn't wear these
out I mean I might wear them out on my
head like this I don't think I wear them
like to block the Sun because they
literally don't do anything there's like
clear and don't block anything else next
is this crop top this it's ultimate out
there alert looks so freaking tiny in my
hand but on its really really cute and
I've seen it everyone wear this in
either white or black there's a white
and black version but I hadn't really
seen anyone wearing the pink version I
thought the pink version was so freaking
cute so I bought the pink version and I
just like wearing this with again I was
jeans high-waisted denim and like
converse things like that I think two
tops are literally perfect for summer
like I own so many freaking tube tops
now and that's because they're so simple
to wear so I suggest to toe make sure
things are from be like out from under
line that Urban out there
which that's like The Pajama online I
believe and this is just a one-piece but
I bought this not even for pajamas I
wore this or I wanted to wear it for
just like a regular outfit with Md toes
or sandals or even like heels like you
could dress this up I just thought it
was really really cool it has a tie on
the waves and like that'll be in the
front so I just bought it because you
know what I don't own a lot of jumpsuits
and I thought this would be really cute
style so the next thing I bought is this
pajama top and I also bought the
matching pajama pants I posted a picture
like this on my instrum I'm going to put
the picture here you know I'm showing
you how I try it on but I posted this
picture on 4th of July and this is so
freaking soft and it makes me look so
tan and I actually wore this top out
which is like high-waisted jeans the day
of fourth of July because it's really
cute on you've know it's supposed to be
for pajamas I don't even think that it
is I even think there's pajama pants you
can literally wear with like heels and a
different like bodysuit and this would
be so cute so I bought these because I
love Urban Outfitters pajama line if you
guys haven't ever tried and user like
pajamas stuff on it's so soft like it's
made perfectly for you to sleep in and I
just think it's awesome so I always
throw in a pajama section that is
everything that I asked to show you guys

doing a summer look what kind of deals

outfits of how I style just a few of
