first of all I'm in a different spot we
have this like new room at a house that
my mom redecorated and so I wanted to
film in it just for today because the
lighting looks really pretty and it's
all like white in the yeah okay so I'm
going to be doing a Q&amp;amp;A and so you guys
sent me questions on Twitter that I'm
going to be answering if you guys don't
have my Twitter I'll leave it here it's
just keep Melbourne but you guys can
always like tweet me stuff and I'm
always I'm always always on Twitter like
Twitter is my life so if you guys want
ask me questions that's where to do it
who is your fashion icon so I have like
multiple I feel like I love like every
fashion like person that everyone else
loves like I loved you to detail of
kendall Jenner I love Kylie I love
Rihanna I love her style but I also love
Ariana Grande like I don't know I just
love all their kind of clothes mixed
together do you watch any other
youtubers yes actually watch other
youtubers obviously but I do not watch
YouTube as much it's like you guys would
like think I do maybe um but I think
some of my favorite youtubers would have
to be like Shawn Tigre man I love her
just because she's really funny and her
makeup is obviously amazing like Carli
bybel and um I don't know I love
watching makeup videos I think of my
favorite videos to watch right now our
story time videos which obviously those
are like such a thing but I think it's
Tana
I'm you guys probably like no she is but
I watched like all of her story time
videos and I think she's the funniest
person I've ever seen in my life so I
love her videos right now how was the
Justin Bieber concert
it was literally amazing I'm a huge
Justin Bieber fan I've let her gums like
ever seen one of his concerts ever like
when he was like a little like infant
but I loved it it was so good I'll
insert a little picture of when I was
right here because I'm going to be doing
a makeup tutorial from that look that I
had at the Justin Bieber concert if you
guys want to see that but I'm pretty
sure though because one of you guys
tweeted me and said you want to see it
and then the other one is what are you
currently watching on Netflix like I
said I said this in my spring get ready
with me I'm watching One Tree Hill and I
love it and now I like the end of season
4 I'm almost in season 5 and it's so
good right now
again Brooke is still my favorite
character but it's getting better how do
you feel about not being at Coachella
the fact
like I'm not able to go to Coachella is
kind of sad I used to be like really
upset about it like a while ago but I'm
honestly over it because I know like I'm
eventually going to go I'm decided like
I'm like I will be going at one point in
my life I'll be at Coachella so I can't
really not mad about it right now cuz
I'm going if you could own any Kylie lip
kit color what would it be I feel like
if I could own any it would probably be
Dolce K just because I really like the
way that looks and I don't have a color
like in my lip stuff that's like that
but I just got the actually oh I moved
the box I have the box over there but I
just got the Kylie gloss so I just got
these so cute cause I ordered that one
for myself I got why I got it for me and
Hallie and then how they ordered
literally and like she got two of those
so we have all the glosses now and I'm
very excited to get them and use them
and we're so cute today but I took it
off earlier when I was eating or
whatever but I really really love it so
if I could own and you would probably be
Dolce K out of like the liquid lipsticks
and then I have all the glosses and so I
like those when you were little what was
your dream job this is so weird but I
always wanted to be a maid like I
remember always telling my mom like I
wanted to clean like I wanted to clean
people's houses I thought that was so
cool like I am so like weird about
things I love things like super neat and
I love like cleaning gives me like so
much like peace like if I'm just like
really stressed out I just start
cleaning everything and like I'm good so
I used to always think like oh my god it
might be a baby I want to like do other
people's homes like now not so much but
I did want to do that would you ever get
a tattoo so yeah I would probably get a
tattoo I've actually plan on getting a
tattoo me my mom and my sister want to
get one and then I also want another one
of flowers which sounds really weird but
if you guys like know me at all like I
love flowers literally like hello I I
love flowers I just moved those from my
room into this room because I wanted
flowers in the background of this video
but I just think they're so pretty start
propagating flowers and then I'm getting
another one with my mom and my sister
literally this tweet killed me this is
what's your opinion on this picture and
it's a picture of me when I dressed up
as the Cookie Monster for Halloween and
it's so horrific I don't even have
on that because it makes me so I hate
myself I would have gonna mediate myself
what are some things on your bucket list
I would love to go skydiving and I know
that's like always like something people
say like if they want to do whatever
like it's a bucket list thing but I
really do want to go skydiving
really bad and I've also always wanted
to go to like Amsterdam really bad so I
want to go to Amsterdam for some reason
I want to go see like I don't know I
just want to go walk around there
there's a lot of things I think for most
my bucket list it would be to like
travel like I want to travel everywhere
what's the most annoying social media
trend okay I'm trying to figure out
because a lot of things on social media
annoy me but at the same time like like
five mile thing is annoying in the five
months Center I'm like doing it but
there's so many vines that people make
like so much more funny than they really
are like I was just showing my mom the
the look at all those chickens video and
she was like why is that thing like why
do people think that's funny and I'm
like I don't really know like social
media is so weird but there's a lot of
really annoying things I think one of
the most annoying would probably be like
Instagram themes I wish they weren't a
thing because they're so good like I
love them but at the same time it's like
I just want to Instagram whatever I
wanted Instagram but I'm really weird
about it and I want to keep like the
whole thing I have going on there
it's annoying okay so that is all the
questions I'm gonna answer for this
video my camera is about to die but
before it in the video you guys always
ask me if I have a snapchat so I just
made a public snapchat I will leave the
little like code here or my name or
whatever it's really easy it's just
Lilburn Keaton but you guys can add me
on my public snapchat and I've been
snapping all day today it's like the
first day I used it so you guys can go
and me on that also random side no but I
got a PA box and the only reason I'm
mentioning this is because someone
messaged me and asked me if they could
send me candy from Indonesia and we're
like oh you won't you try it on video
but I don't want to give my address out
to people because I think that's really
creepy so I got a few bucks if you guys
I've ever wanted to like send me
something from somewhere else wanted me
to like try it I don't know
and isn't like that I have a peel box
and I'm gonna list it in the description
down below and yeah so that's basic
and for this video I hope you guys liked
it and I will see you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
