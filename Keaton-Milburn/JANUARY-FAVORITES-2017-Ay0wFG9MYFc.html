be my January favorites and I am so
excited to film this for you guys I love
filming favorites videos as you guys
know if you guys are new to my channel
don't forget to subscribe and hit that
Bell so you guys can you notified when
I'm uploading new videos and follow me
on all my social media so now that we
got me self promoting myself out of the
way let's get into the products I
noticed at the end of January but I do
have a really cool video going up next
week that I'm excited to upload for you
guys that's why I'm uploading this one a
little bit early so yeah anyway let's
actually get into the products so the
first three products we want to share
with you guys are a foundation I say
three because I have three shades of
them I have them in shades 20 40 and 45
and this is the Maybelline Dream cushion
and I am obsessed with this stuff guys
if you guys obviously saw in my everyday
makeup routine I use this stuff in it
and I use this almost every single day
just because I really like a really good
dewy foundation and this you can make
matte but I really like this for like
just an overall it just makes your skin
really glowy and I really like that
about it
I also like that it's really tiny and
compact so if I'm ever out anywhere I
can just adjust this what it looks like
it's like a little sponge and I just fit
my foundation brush in it and apply it
all over and I just really like this
foundation if you guys are looking for a
more affordable drugstore foundation I
highly suggest this next up is another
product by Maybelline and this is the
omastar strobing liquid and shade 100
and this is basically a highlighter and
it's a strobing liquid you can use it as
a primer or just like underneath your
foundation but I choose this on top of
my foundation because I just like the
glow that it gives me I also sometimes
will use it underneath and on top but
mainly on top of my foundation to give
me a really good glow that also have
this in shades 200 and 300 and it's like
a gold one and a pink one but this is my
favorite honestly guys I'm just really
really into liquid highlighters right
now the last makeup product is the peach
palette and everyone is talking about
this is the two
sweet peach palette look at these shades
I mean I have to I have to smile every
time I open it up but what I really like
about this palette I think be I think
why it's my favorite this month is
because not only does it have really
really pretty pigmentation and so many
amazing colors you can do so much with
just one palette I love that Too Faced
always does a really good job of being
able to have neutral shades in a palette
but also be able to have like the green
and the pink and the purple and the dark
like I just love that Too Faced that's a
really good job of being able to have
really cool looks as well as being able
to have a neutral eye all in one palette
so I really really like this I feel like
it's definitely replaced my modern
renaissance just for right now because I
still go back to it every once in a
while but right now this is definitely
my favorite eyeshadow palette Oh
next up are these glasses I swear this
is the last I'm going to talk about
these glasses like I know I'm so
annoying about my glasses but I love
them these are the Florence glasses my
glasses USA they are gold a lot of you
guys are saying they're sold out I
haven't checked yet but I feel like they
might be sold out just because everyone
has these kind of glasses I feel like
there's such a trend right now I'm not
even just making this up because I think
they're cute I think you're such a trend
I keep seeing them on Instagram and they
are prescription if you guys are
wondering all the glass I got from glass
USA are prescription so I don't know if
you guys are looking for new glasses go
check them out like this cuz they're
really cute
my next favorite of the month would have
to be well okay let me just say my next
favorite of the month will definitely
have to be heels in general not even
just this product I'm about to show you
guys but I'm just really I loved kilos I
love everyone who works at kilos I love
being able to go to New York with keels
it was such an amazing trip and just to
be able to like learn more about keels
as a brand in general it's actually
super interesting so for them to be able
to like take me to New York that was
just so exciting for me and really fun
and it just makes you understand a brand
a lot better so the product I'm going to
show you guys is the pure vitality skin
renewing cream and actually love this
I'm gonna
so actually just love the brand in
general and I wanted to share this
product with you but I just got a box
for some reason my nose is so stuffy
okay chill actually just got a box of a
bunch of heals products that I'm so
excited to share with you guys in the
future I'm gonna test them out for
probably like a few months and then
share with you guys because skincare is
so important to me I probably have 1000
times more skincare products and I do
makeup and so that is just something I
am always working on I'm always trying
out new skincare just because I like it
I don't know it's fun for me I like
putting on the different masks every
single none or a different moisturizer
every single night I just feel like I
don't know that's my favorite so again
I'll probably be trying out a lot more
Kiehl's products coming in the next few
months because I just got another
package but I really wanted to mention
the pure vitality really quickly for you
guys my next favorite is a Netflix
series and it is a sea captain just
kidding okay it is blind spot it's
actually not a Netflix it's on Hulu and
I really really like it actually my
sister's don't got me hooked on it if
you guys like more action-filled shelves
it's literally like guns every single
episode it almost gets annoying because
it's like loud and I don't want to hear
it but blank spot is such a good show I
don't even want to describe it too bad
cuz I want to give anything away but if
you guys are looking for a new Netflix
series are okay cool ooh if you guys are
looking for a new Poulos series to watch
it is a blind spot and it is amazing and
I don't know if that's all I could say
it's just freaking awesome okay so for
music favorites of the month I actually
didn't do December favorites because I
had so many other videos going up I just
felt like I'll just save it all till
January but I do have to play this on my
Spotify I make a playlist every single
month you guys know this my December
favorites is actually really really good
it's so weird that not my playlist say
2017 and not do any 16 that's actually
so depressing
whatever the weekends album was really
good when it came on December I really
really like rockin I feel like come in
true colors I like star girl interlude
because I really loved one Adele Rey and
she's in that I also like obviously a
moves and living single by Big Sean he
is my favorite rapper of all time and so
I definitely had to put him into this
playlist moving to my actual January
favorites playlist
I obviously love Ed Sheeran I put it in
my last video me like jammy because I
love castle only Hell by Ed Sheeran ed
Sheeran is one of my favorite artists of
all time I went to his concert like
three years ago and to this day it is
probably still one of my favorite
concerts I've ever been to I just I love
him I just love everything about him
what else is on here also Kalani is
coming out with a album this month and
so she's releasing like other singles
she just released do you dirty actually
yesterday and that is I don't know I
like that song I also really like my
favorite part by Mac Miller and Ariana
Grande which came out a while ago but I
still listen to it like every single day
also post Malone's new album is really
really good so all of that music is
really exciting it's actually really
good if I do say so myself you guys
always cheat then you're like your music
tastes you're playing this for this
month so good and it makes me happy
because if I like an artist I like
really like an artist so when I hear
