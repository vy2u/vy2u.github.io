to be January favorites and I'm so
excited about doing a favorites video I
feel like I said every video and I say
this part every video but I actually
haven't done a favorites video since
October so it doesn't seem like that
long but it's actually been a while
so I'm very excited to be showing you
guys all of these products and yeah
let's just get into it so the first
thing I'm going to be showing you is a
brand and this is Qatari beauty I think
that's heist and I don't know ever how
to pronounce anything but I have this
okay so the first thing I'm gonna show
you guys is the coconut melt so this is
literally first of all let me just say I
do not like coconuts in food like I
don't like coconut shrimp and like
coconut stuff but the smell of coconuts
like if you don't like the smell coconut
something's wrong with you I'm just so
good what I really really love about
this is that you can use it for like 500
different things like you can like use
it for stretch marks stuff like that
also what I like the most but I use it
the most for cuz I take a lot of baths I
like to like take like a chunk of it and
stick it in my bath so that like when it
dissolves it like makes my my fin makes
my fin because I'm a freaking mermaid
and then it's my skin feel really really
nice afterwards so I like the feeling
that the coconut gifts and you can also
use it for like a hair mask I haven't
tried that out yet but I know I want to
try a lot of different things with this
product so yeah I really like this and
then the other thing that I like you
guys know I get spray tans all the time
I don't have one now it's why I'm
freaking pale but I guess right hands
all the time so this is the coconut body
glow and that's basically like shimmer
but it's not just like straight glitter
it is very glittery but like once you
apply it to your body it kind of like
fades out so I really really like this
because it gives the perfect glow
especially when I have spray tans I like
to put this on my color bones and then
like not on my arms as much but like all
my legs did it make something shiny and
stuff sorry like this it's just like
glittery spray I don't know I like these
both so if you guys want to check out
the part beauty I will leave um building
some wall you guys can go check them out
they have a bunch other stuff they have
like scrubs and stuff oh yeah and this I
also can use to shave your legs you can
use this as like a dry shading so so I
like this there's tons of things you can
do with these products which is why I
like it so
the next thing I wanna touch you guys I
showed you in my skincare routine if you
guys haven't seen my skincare routine
I've gotten such amazing feedback and
some new views on it so you guys can
click right here and go watch that also
it's a Christmas tree still up it's the
end of January I've got to fix things
guys I'm getting my life together so
this is the Luna 2 and I absolutely love
this I know I keep staying absolutely
love everything but obviously I'm gonna
love everything this video it's a
favorites video so this helps take all
of my makeup and all the crap that's on
my face off so I use this with the bozo
cleanser or any kind of like breakup oil
stuff and I'm the other day I was like I
wonder if it's making that much or
difference where I think it's making or
I just am like imagining it's making a
difference so I tried to wash my face
with like just that motion comes alike
with my hands and literally the feeling
that I had afterwards it was like the
oil was still on my face but like with
this because it's like vibrating and
stuff it literally like scrubs
everything off of it as opposed to like
leaving like a thin layer of the oil on
my face so I really really love this I
honestly I don't think I could go back
to like not using anything to get stuff
off my face this is like the best thing
I've ever used and it's just like
chargeable so the charge lasts a really
really long time there's no batteries
nothing like that for it I don't know
there's just a bunch of different uses
and they sell these at Sephora and Froyo
if you guys want to go check them out
I'll leave the links down below but yeah
I really really love this next things
I'm gonna be showing you guys are makeup
products so the first one is guys I
don't want to tell you guys about this
for so long I want to show you guys in
December when I first bought it but I
ran out of a foundation that was like my
actual skin color so I was like okay
let's just go to CVS and pick up some
foundation so I got the Maybelline matte
and poreless fit me foundation and this
is the best foundation of my life first
of all I just like poured on the back of
my hand put it on my face apply it and
it gives me the best freakin coverage
and I don't even have to use like that
much of it it's so it's really like
liquidy it's not as thick so it does
apply very very easily and I can use
this I can build it up or I can like you
like everyday basis so I really like
this and like the shade is the most
amazing shade when I don't have a spray
tan next this is the pure cameo contour
stick so this is just a little contour
stick that comes with like I've been
using this for quite a while recently oh
my god I'm looking you guys off okay
anyway there's like this little brown
side and then there is a little
concealer side so it is the perfect
shade it comes in like a bunch of other
ones doesn't just have this one shade
but it's the perfect shade for me so I
like to contour with this side and then
for the concealer part I don't use it
much for my under eyes but I do it'll
maybe take like a straight edge brush
and I put the concealer underneath my
eyebrow and on top of it and I shape my
eyebrows before I like fill them in so I
like using that for this the last two
makeup products are lip liners and I got
these for Christmas so you guys probably
already know but I have sore this is the
Mac lip pencil and sort and it's just
like I cute like it cute wow yeah it's a
cute pencil it's a really pretty like
pink rose shade I don't know I like this
one and then this one's almost the same
but this is like in a this one's darker
this was in in control and I needed a
darker lip liner and this one is
actually the pro long wear lip pencil so
I always get confused as to like what
the difference is but one of them
shorter wouldn't longer I don't know but
I have in control and sore and I've been
using them all month just because if I
don't want to wear like actual lipstick
I could just like a lipstick filled in
with this and a gloss and it looks
really good
so that has all the beauty and skin
products I have for this month now
moving on to like random crap so the
first one is this coloring book I also
showed you guys in my what I got for
Christmas but I've been loving it this
month because I actually color in it
guys I didn't just buy this coloring
book to freaking look at so I covered
this so basically this one is just like
a bunch of like hair so like there's
this lady and she owes like a pineapple
and stuff I don't know it's just like
really weird so anyway I've been
covering this a lot so I colored this
one has a bunch of flowers but you guys
know
flowers and then this one I did like
ombre hair and I don't know so I've just
been covering a lot so I like this and
then also I bought these colored pencils
as especially expecially it's I bought
these colored pencils especially for
this coloring book and these are the
prismacolor pencils I think they're at
Home Depot I found it I don't know but
they're not like Crayola colored pencils
cause originally I bought crayons and
then I got these and they're like the
but I don't know what's so magical about
them but they're really the pigment of
them it's like really good I feel like
I'm talking about makeup but like the
pigment of these colored pencils so good
so I'm not gonna be using the Crayola
ones I used these now moving on to music
so I haven't had a lot of music
favorites for this month because I've
been like kind of slow and listening to
say music for the past few months
obviously Bryson tiller I'm still
listening to I loved Bryce and Taylor's
but it
I also if you guys didn't know I have a
Spotify so I put all of my monthly
favorites and I'll say when you go on
here it'll say January favorites and I
only have 8 songs on my January
favorites as opposed to last month I had
24 so this month I have runnin by Kalani
I also have wanted by Kalani and then a
old one which is my piece by Miguel and
then I really like Mac Miller's new
albums too my favorite one from that
whoa my nose just like freaked out got
all stuffy so I really like weakened by
Mac Miller and then of course if you
guys haven't heard it I like Mike studs
new album so my favorite one on that
album is 10th inning and I also like
after hours and anyone else and then um
yeah I think that's all for this month
that's all the music I'm like for this
month you guys can go check it out on my
Spotify Spotify is also like free by the
way this isn't sponsored but Spotify is
also free I mean can purchase a
subscription so like you don't have to
wait on ads and like you can't click
shuffle when you do that I don't know
anyway I'm gonna explain to you not
sponsored so before it in this video I
know it was super quick but I've been
buying a few more things recently and I
haven't really been buying like a ton of
stuff but I have bought a few new pieces
that I really want to show you guys but
I don't really want to make like a
lookbook out of it so if you guys want
