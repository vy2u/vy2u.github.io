is in like the middle of februari okay
I'm aware let's move on what's up guys
if you haven't guessed from the title
i'm doing a january favorites and yes
it's literally like almost the end of
februari okay i'm aware my videos are
slow I'm just saying some people are
posting their January favorites january
twentieth like I still have 11 days to
find a new favorite so I am waiting my
full month to be able to film this video
break guys okay I'm just saying I know
I'm late so first things I'm going to be
starting off with our clothing that I
have been obsessed with in the month of
january and i normally don't pick like
clothing clothing items but I've just
really I'm not been digging these what
is this switch this around anyway I
really been like obsessing over these
clothes I just figured I'd show you guys
so the first things I've been obsessed
with i'm showing you two of them just
because I don't want to show you all of
them but i have been loving t-shirts so
the first one is this one that i got
walther of shopping okay you can't even
read it says the rolling stones on it oh
my god she doesn't even know what that
means she just bought it cuz she wants
to look hipster yeah okay i bought this
because it's a freaking dragon like this
looks so cool i love it and so I just
thought it was really cool actually got
these thrift shopping so I would tell
you the store but they're like not to be
found the second 1i got Walter of
shopping is this one and this one says
what does even say junior giant okay so
i thought this one would be really
really Hugh eyes my phone going off I
thought this one would be really really
cute with a ball cap and like
high-waisted black jeans I don't know
the reason I'm showing you these two is
because i have been loving t-shirts for
the month of like january and even like
februari and on because because because
because because it's not cold that much
anymore but I still need to wear jeans I
like wearing high waisted jeans and then
just t-shirt because I don't really need
to wear a sweater um as I say I don't
really need to wear sweater next thing
I'm going to be showing you guys is a
sweater this looks like a literal
blanket this is a sweater that I have
been obsessed with and you guys might
not know them
says then because I don't wear it
because I'm so obsessed with it that I
want to wear it every day so that I just
end up not even wearing it I've only
worn it like twice so this is the with
oversized I showed this in a hall but um
it is from brandy melville and it's just
so soft and it's so long and comfy you
can just wear leggings every day and it
just it's perfect there's nothing wrong
with it nothing at all so that is all
for clothing and fashion and stuff um
fashion what did I do this the next
thing will be showing you guys is beauty
products and the first thing I'm showing
you is this beautiful hair spray oh my
gosh okay so if you watch my how I curl
my hair tutorial i said i don't use
hairspray and i have just taken that
back i love not your mother's of hair
products and stuff and so i bought this
at like I don't even know oh I've also
walmart so i bought us at walmart and
they have it at Target and I'm pretty
sure they have it at CVS and my curls
today I used it it just is fabulous the
next two things are makeup products and
this one's not so much like makeup
makeup I literally go to epic tori
secret but for some reason it has made
my life like change okay guys beauty
shine gloss and the color brilliant and
it's just basically a hot pink and you
might be like oh my gosh I do not wear
hot pink okay um I don't either but when
i wear my lip liner those by Mac it's in
anticipation when I wear it I put like
my lip liner on and then i put a little
bit of pink plot on top of it and then I
put this and just completes it and makes
my lip looks like makes my lips lips I
can't even speak today makes my lips
look full and luscious and just great
and it tastes good too just kidding guys
I didn't just like that but just smokin
next thing is this quarrel lista blush
by benefit and I've been loving this in
which it's really weird because I don't
really boss and I don't wear blush and
my two favorite things this month our
lip gloss and blush oh and i don't use
hairspray I'm just changing it up I'm
just who's keaton anymore i got this
much and it's a bee
beautiful is just like a little coral
color and it smells so good and I am
just loving it this was in my beauty
haul and so for the whole month of
January I've just been using it every
single day even when I don't wear makeup
I just put a little bit on and it's just
amazing next is on to my favorite which
is food and only one of them is actual
is in actual food but it is these veggie
chips they are called exotic vegetable
chips and they are from there like a
chibi bit heb band see I can't talk heb
brand and they're from the central
market I don't know they have no art
artificial preservatives or flavors and
they're just they're great there are the
greatest things I the only reason I
mentioned in these is because I asked my
mom if you please forget veggie chips
instead of potato chips from the store
which you got these and I was like a
regular veggie chips and then you eat
them and they're like the best chips
you've ever had in your life like
they're the best veggie chips they don't
taste like vegetables they taste like
chips it's like they're tricking me
that's sweet potatoes carrots Yukon Gold
potato and Kappa kabocha squash I don't
know I've been eating these obviously
doesn't look like it it's not open but
that's cuz i ate the first bag the next
product i've been loving for the month
of january is this 50 and this is
actually a detoxing tea but i use it for
different reasons so if you guys know me
I love coffee and I drink coffee every
single morning because I feel like it
just gives me caffeine kind of wakes me
up but this does that like x 10 so this
gives me tons of energy in the morning
and I take a little to-go cup on the way
to school so you can just pop these
little pouches in i'll show you guys and
they're just like little tiara pouches
they're all natural hundred percent
natural and they're just little herbs
and you can stick them in your tea for
like three minutes and then take it out
and it tastes amazing and just gives you
all the energy you need also i've been
working out a lot recently so you have
before I work out I take these and I
just drink a tea before I go and I feel
like it really helps me and it kind of
like I don't
I feel like it just gives me a lot more
energy that I normally have 1 i'm
working out and especially before school
really really wakes me up so if you guys
are interested in getting this tea i
will leave the link down below and yeah
you guys should definitely check it out
last thing I want to be talking to you
guys about is music because I always
talk about using every month I have new
bands and new things every month and I
really really love and so this month
thanks to Blair so thank you so much
Blair I'm giving you all the credit for
this because you literally deserve it
but I have been obsessed with the
Griswolds if you watched by
behind-the-scenes photo shoot you'll see
i use the Griswolds as like my
background music you guys are wondering
but I'm obsessed with their whole album
like their whole album is just just
makes my life I'm looking at on my phone
that's why I'm looking down but um their
whole album is just amazing and I also
did change my outro song to a song from
them but it's like remix the next few
songs and I've absolutely been loving
this month is by catfish in the bottle
min it's from the album balcony so the
first song is cocoon which is like an
amazing song I want to use it for one of
my future videos um for something I
don't know what but it's just it's more
like I don't even know how to describe
it but it's just like kind of kind of
alternative but I've really been liking
that and then I really love Kathleen by
a catfish in the barman so I've been
loving them a lot and those I think are
basically all my music for this month so
that is it for my January favorites hope
