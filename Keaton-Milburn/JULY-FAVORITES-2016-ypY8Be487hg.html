this video and every single time I film
it it is out of focus and it's horrible
so hopefully this is a good take what's
up guys so today's video is going to be
a July favorites feel you guys know what
this video is obviously through these
every month but this is the last month
that I'm doing it here in this filming
space I am moving in five problem I
think less than five days and it is
crazy to me it is blowing my mind but
the next time I film and have the video
up will be in my dorm room at college so
this is crazy but yeah I just want to
get right into it also if you guys are
interested in like all the moving and
like what I'm doing then I am vlogging
every single day I'm like packing and
I'm moving all my stuff I'm doing a dorm
tour kind of like haul kind of thing all
on my vlog channel so you guys want to
see any of that where I'm going when I'm
doing all that kind of stuff it is all
gonna be on my vlogging channel so go
subscribe over there and you guys will
see cuz I'm not gonna post in on my main
channel you know surprisingly I have a
lot of I'm sweating I'm so wedding in
this code right now like I'm legit I'm
sweating Oh
surprisingly I have a lot of beauty
favorites this month
normally I don't have like that many I
don't switch up my products that often
but I've lost that so the first one is
the Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
mascara and I have had this in my drawer
for quite a while this is what it looks
like adorable old school little showing
you what that is okay anyway um I found
this in my drawer for a while and I
don't know why I'm just never used and I
have so much mascara all the time so
many new products some things just get
caught toss at the side so this mascara
I am obsessed with I really feel like it
helps lift my lashes we're really good
I'm using this all month and I'm
probably gonna use this to this empty
and hopefully I can find another next is
this l'oreal infallible setting spray
and i'm so late with this like everyone
has this
ready or everyone's used in at some
point and I'm just not about setting
sprays I'm really not I just never
really cared for them but I decide to
try this out because one I want to see
if setting sprays actually help my
makeup into I really like the feeling of
like mist on my face I love the Mario
Badescu mist after I wash my face I like
love the way that feels so I don't know
I just like this and I feel like it just
helps my makeup stay on so I love it I
literally want I'm not gonna spray it I
don't do that so the next thing I'm
going to mention is the glow kit by
Anastasia Beverly Hills this is in that
glow and I love this so these are the
shades this is golden bronze sunburst
bubbly dripping and gold why can't I
breathe okay I normally use dripping in
gold and bubbly mixed together that's
what I have on today and then I use
golden bronze with my bronzer I just
like makes it in there to give me like a
little bit more glow and I love this
this is like the only glow kit I will
need I don't need all like seven of them
that she has but I just really love this
one and I think it's just the perfect
natural glow next which is also by
Anastasia Beverly Hills is the modern
renaissance palette and this has been so
talked about like everyone I'm sure you
guys haven't seen this palette I don't
know where you've been maybe under a
rock or something but this palette is
beautiful it is amazing I could talk
about this for hours like literally I
could talk about this forever it's my
obsession but I'm not gonna and you guys
want to see a fully dedicated makeup
tutorial with just this palette and like
how I use it and create ly different
looks and stuff like that
let me know in the comments down below I
know a lot of people are doing that but
I really love this palette and I think
that there's so many creative ways that
you guys can like just mess around with
this so let me know if you guys want to
see that and I'll definitely do it for
you guys
next speaking of eyeshadow I have some
of the rushes so this is the best of
sigma brush set Thank You Sigma for this
this is amazing Oh / you're flying
everywhere so these are the brushes and
comes with I'm gonna link it down below
so you guys can go like click it but
this is the brush I've been using for my
foundation I use it today for my
foundation I love it I love it a lot
more than using a beauty blender because
I use a lot more product when I use a
beauty blender which I feel like it's
supposed to be the opposite but that is
how I am and then I have all these
blending brushes all these for eyeshadow
which I think it's amazing because it's
so hard to try and do different things
with your makeup and like try and expand
how you do your makeup do like a cut
crease or like a really cool smoked out
if you don't have like the right tools
for it and so I think that these brushes
are amazing for that so I love these
I've been using them all month like I
think they're so the next things I want
to show you guys you probably never seen
before this is gonna be a huge shock to
you guys and like after you see these
you're gonna be like you're such a
trendsetter like how like how did you
come up with that idea like whatever I
don't know but I'm a genius
I bought chokers um I am obsessed with
chokers just like every other girl in
the entire world at this moment and I
got these from Sorella boutique and this
is a pink one a white one and a great
one and they are all suede like velvety
and then my favorite one is this one it
is nude
oh my gosh I love them I love choker
that like a black one I have a gray one
I have another baby pink one I have it
she's like I have issues with chokers I
absolutely love them but these are from
Shelly boutique and I just really think
they're amazing also this sweatshirt
it's from Sue Ellen boutique not
sponsored I just recently got a package
from them like I purchased a package on
their website
what if why am I even explaining myself
anyway and I just think it's really
comfy and cute so I wonder where oh I'll
let this out okay so this is from
Clinique so this is their rush I don't
remember the exact name of it I'll name
it right here and then this is our
liquid facial soap and mild
so normally you guys know when it so I
use my oil to take my makeup off and
then I use my Luna to scrub it off after
I do
I normally use like three other face
washes because if I'm gonna be taking my
makeup off I'm going to get every ounce
of makeup off I don't want any of my
hairline I don't want any like I want my
face completely clear like I want all my
makeup off so I use my oil when I take
that off and then I use this and this
gets off any excess dirt or makeup or
just like anything I don't want on my
face and it's cool yeah yeah and
vibrates for like thirty seconds you
don't need to use it for too long where
else I don't know I don't know what
happened but I just used almost used up
like thirty Seconds to a minute and then
I put this soap on it and then it's the
perfect combination and I think it's so
cute and has my little oh it's upside
down
how's my little Instagram name has all
my stuff on here and I think that's
really cute and I just really love
clinic everything about Clinique I love
it so next let's talk about music so you
