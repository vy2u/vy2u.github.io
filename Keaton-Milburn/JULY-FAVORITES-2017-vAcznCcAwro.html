to be my July favorites actually have so
many favorites and super excited to
shoot today I feel like I always do that
but I really for some reason it's so
excited for this month's July favorites
and this month music of the month which
will be coming out in like a few days so
subscribe if you're not subscribed
because you guys are going to want to
see that so anyway i'm just going to get
right into it because why not so the
first product in which talk to you guys
but is this shampoo and conditioner so
these are by Giovanni hair and this is
the tea tree triple treat invigorating
shampoo and conditioner so if you guys
didn't know tea tree oil and just tea
tree in general is really really good
for you can also put tea tree oil like
on your skin and it helps with that
tense things but I absolutely love that
this shampoo conditioner has peach
granite there is a car going on I
absolutely love that this conditioner
and shampoo has tea tree in it because I
have a very very dry scalp as you guys
know you guys watch my videos you guys
know I've talked about that before so
this really helps relieve the dryness
and the feeling so this actually leaves
such an amazing feeling in my hair even
after I wash the shampoo conditioner out
like the feeling of like the kingly and
amazing sensation so my hair is still
there even after I get out of the shower
so I really really like this they also
have shampoo and conditioner for
different kinds of hair types just
depending on what you prefer this is
what I prefer which is the teachery
triple tree advocating shampooing
conditioner so if you guys are
interested in picking up shampoo and
conditioner from Giovanni here I will
link all the places that you guys can
get them in the description box below
you guys can get them from Kroger is you
have to get them from Fry's you guys
live in California and I think it's
Ralph's I believe of my relief all the
place that you guys know pick up their
products down below because I absolutely
love them and they're also vegan so they
do not test on any animals and they're
also sulfate free which is really really
good because a lot of products use
soleplate and that could really damage
your hair and stuff so I think it's
awesome that they are vegan and so free
free so I will leave everything in the
description box below if you guys want
to go check out Giovanni hair because
absolutely love this so I've actually
got a few makeup products that I want to
share with you guys so the first thing I
have been using
legitimately all month like I have
South fuchsia I just went to LA for a
week which by the way subscribe to my
blog channel because I belong there
and I post a blog there seriously the
blogs from my trip are so good anyways
let me just like promo myself their time
with LA for a week and I've had this
this is the take me on vacation I shadow
palette by Kylie cosmetics and as you
can see them literally used almost
everything color I've even used like the
blue sparkly one like I just absolutely
love this palette and it has been so
good to travel with because I can do so
many different looks like I didn't need
another cowlick this was legitimately
all I needed so with that I've also been
using the Too Faced glitter bomb palette
so I have this on my saying you guys can
also I don't know if you guys can tell
but I literally used almost every shade
of glitter on here as well the only one
I think no ass no way I have used ever
shared on here yeah I absolutely love
this palette so I always like you a dark
crease color and then I will put a
glitter over the whole lid so as you
guys can see today I did what I said oh
it's on which is this really pretty gold
color and I will look down you guys can
like see but basically I did like a dark
cruciate and then I just go in with this
glitter and it looks like you're really
professional with your eye shadow which
I'm not like I'm literally not so for me
to just use this glitter palette and you
look like I am legitimately Jacqueline
Hill makes me feel so much better about
my life
the next product I'm not really sure if
I've ever mentioned before but for some
reason like I think I just like just
stopped using it and then I was like
wait why'd I ever stop it is this makeup
forever professional Ultra HD
microfinish pressed powder that is the
longest name but it's basically just
this yellow powder pressed powder and I
use it for underneath my eyes I set all
day on you guys I kind of gave up on
setting my whole face because I'm into
like a more dewy look now and I just
feel like want to use the Laura Mercier
powder I don't really bake my face
anymore I don't do any of that I
literally only set my under eyes and
that's it I don't set the rest of my
face maybe I'll set like my chin in my
forehead but that's about it I use just
this so if you guys are interested I
highly recommend this because it makes
money
look saw next is this this is the heart
glisten cheek stain and this in I don't
know if they have a shade of this but I
feel like maybe they only have one shade
anyway this is what it is it's literally
just a cheek stain and I just use my
brush and I'm so into cream blushes
right now I'm still into cream products
actually in general because like I said
I'm into a more dude look now I'm not
trying to use so much like powder on my
face so I've been using this cream blush
and it smells guys oh my gosh it
literally smells so freakin good that's
so weird but it smells like fruity and
it just is amazing I've been using this
on my cheeks I'm using it today looks
amazing thank you very much was crazy
about all these products that are like
talking about this month is because
normally if it's a favorites video does
makeup it's like oh I just found this
this month and I liked it for awhile
these products I've used probably every
single day this month like there's not a
product I'm talking about that I don't
think I've used every single day I use
all of these every single day so the
next one is the back in a liquid crystal
lift topper glow block and this is in
the pearl and gold shimmer they have a
lot of other ones and there's a pink
ones and things like that I have use
this every single day I don't even know
how to describe it to you you just have
to get it understand but it's on my lips
let me just I don't know it's just like
a really really pretty gloss if you guys
can see that it also has like really
pretty reflex in it which I think I like
the most because it's not just a clear
gloss like it has dimension to it and I
think that Beca does a really really
good job with that so I've been using
this probably every single day over
whatever lip color I have on at the time
I will put this over because I just
really really liked it my next favorite
is a clothing item these were in my what
were they in my summer travel which you
guys should definitely go watch because
I put up a lot of clothes that I really
really like in that house if you guys
need some info go watch that video
anyways these are the urban outs that
are low-rise shorts they're the btg
denim shorts I also linked them in my
summer haul because a lot of you guys
are asking so they're in the description
of my summer haul video but I just
absolutely love these I don't know why I
think
so the color the fit it's like sometimes
when it's hot outside you don't always
want to be wearing tight shorts on your
body and then you're just like sweating
and your legs roaming together and it's
just like not a look like it really
isn't so I've been super into baggy
low-rise shorts with like a big t-shirt
or like a small cross off something like
that it just makes me feel so much more
comfortable also just to mention this
hoodie is that a house is a hoodie is
from Urban Outfitters I want you guys to
just start assuming that everything that
I'm wearing in a video is from Urban
Outfitters unless I say otherwise
because I have realized that I don't
wear anything except for Urban
Outfitters like also talk about being a
catfish I'm wearing this hoodie because
you guys are racist and is ready look at
my chest oh my god it's even more red on
camera but yeah I got very very
sunburned about two days ago I messed up
I made a mistake and this is the result
of that so I wore like a higher net
hoodie so that Maya my face in my neck
matched but my chest is just a little
more red than normal anyways guys that's
only half of my July favorites if you
guys want to go check out my blog

from my trip to LA so it was like a week
combined into three different blogs
