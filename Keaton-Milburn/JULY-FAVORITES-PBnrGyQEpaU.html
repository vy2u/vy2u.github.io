going to be a July favorites video and I
am like so excited for this video
because I love I don't know I just love
favorites videos so I will be doing this
every month if you don't know what any
favorites video is basically it's just
me telling you guys everything that I
like really loved or enjoyed or
discovered anything like that that I
found in the month of May I mean whoa
this is joy anything like that that I
have found in the month of July
um so I'm just gonna be sharing that
stuff with you guys and let's just get
right into it the first things I'm gonna
be starting off with are my beauty
favorites I'm gonna be showing you guys
my lush products I'm not gonna go into
detail about these but I am just showing
you that this superbomb scalp treatment
and this mint juleps lip scrub have been
my favorite this month and if you want
to know more about these products then
you can click my lush haul and review
which will be right here these second
Beauty favorite is this Smashbox
foundation primer and honestly I've
never used a primer a tale about this
month and I bought this at Sephora and
it's just Smashbox and it's just a clear
little gel and put it all over your face
and I just find that it really really
helped my skin a lot like it made my
makeup look a lot less oily it just I
don't know and it just helps stay on all
day and I really like this so go get it
next thing is this Jergens natural go
let grow grow grow whoa
blow its blow this Jergens natural glow
moisturizer basically it has SPF 20 and
it just tans your skin gradually like
you put it on every night like my skin
is always really white on my face and
the rest of my body's tan so I put this
on every night and it helps tan and I
find that it just really really
moisturizes my face like really good and
it just comes in this little thing and
it's pretty thick so you don't need to
use a lot every time you use it it's
regularly well and I
Brown but I really really love this
product and you can get it at like CVS
or Target or anywhere like that the next
two products are a hair care products
and this one is the not your mother's
beach babe texturizing the sea salt
spray I've been using this for a few
months I have been using it I don't know
I've been using it for a long time but
during this summer I've really been
using it a lot because just gives me
beachy looking hair and then they also
sell this at Urban Outfitters and this
is the best Vitesse batiste
I don't know what that says but
basically it's just dry shampoo and this
is in the color light it's like light
blonde so it's from my hair and
basically what you do you just there we
go in it smells great okay so that is
this dry shampoo but I really really
have been loving this a lot because also
again like I said in this summer if your
hair is just looking like a little
greasy this just really really helps
especially if you have blonde hair with
blue looking stuff like I do this were
too I'm like choking on this though like
it's really strong the last beauty
product I'm going to share with you guys
is this skiped mint moisturizing
hydrating shaving gel and honestly this
is like the best shaving job ever you I
bought this because I went to camp and
it came in like a little mini size and
I've been so obsessed with it I forgot
how much I loved shaving gel and this is
raspberry rain so it's smells like
heaven berries and cute boys and it just
smells great so this the next thing I'm
going to be sharing with you guys are my
music favorites for this month and I
have a few so I'm gonna go through them
pretty quickly
the first band that I'm gonna be sharing
with you guys is chase Atlantic and they
came out with this EP called Alliance or
whatever it's called I don't really know
how to say it but I've been loving it a
lot and they have like six songs on
there and it's just really awesome
and I listen to them in the shower all
done the next one would be Paramore
their album came out a while ago but
I've been listening to it a lot lately
and I'm going to the concert on Friday
so I'm so excited if you guys don't know
I'm a really big Paramore fan and I just
the next band and then I'm done with
bands is obviously a five seconds to
summer their album it's like the most
amazing thing I listen to it in the
shower when I'm tanning in the car and
I'm getting ready I was doing for
everything like honestly I love this
album so much it's like it's just
everything that I need the next few
songs are just singles and the first one
would be a happy little pill by Troye
Sivan he is a youtuber I believe and
this song is awesome it's kind of like a
weird like vibe like I don't know how to
explain it but it's really cool and I
like that song the next one would be
break free by Ariana Grande and it
features Zedd and I really really love
this song and I'm super excited for a
new album to come out so when it does
I'll definitely probably I will
definitely probably be talking about
that and then the next two songs are
really not like me to like that much but
I really have been listening to them a
lot I really love shower by Becky G I
think that's the name of it yeah I
really love shower by Becky G and I
really love birthday by Katy Perry
they're so fun to listen to and like
dance and just sing really loud to
yourself
I'm gonna be sharing every month you
ain't book that I've read and this book
looks so beaten up and like disgusting
like the whole everything about this
book is like hideous like I don't know
but this was honestly probably one of my
favorite books my friend suggested it to
me and it's awesome it's called Callum
and Harper and if you want to know more
about it you can just go look it up or
get the Goodreads app but it's awesome
and it just got me in my feelings I just
I can't I'm not even gonna tell you what
it's about because you just need to go
get this book or Porter it on Amazon
that's it
and just that's what you need to do now
to the random favourites my random
favourites can go anywhere from like a
pencil to food so basically I'm just
gonna be sharing with you guys a bunch
of random crap that I loved this
rainforest sugarcane candle from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works you guys know I love candles
like that is what I spend majority of my
money on other than like brandy melville
but this candle it smells so good and I
went in back and by wants to get one of
those at all air fresheners and I saw
this is okay guys y'all cannot judge me
for this like what you all know you
wanted to try it
it is the Kim Kardashian hallo game with
my girls she's literally so cute I love
her and I'm obsessed with this game I
play it all the time I'm like really
crazy about this game so I really like
this and if you don't like Kim
Kardashian I'm sorry you're just missing
out on a whole life you could have with
her in these games next to things I
can't actually show you but you need to
go watch them like are you listening to
what I'm saying like you need to go
watch them the first thing is new girl
it's amazing it's this TV series I don't
know if it shows on TV probably does but
it's on Netflix and I found it
it has Zooey Deschanel and I love some
addition oh she's so cute and if you
don't know who that is look it up
because she's I'm just really obsessed
with it and episodes are twenty one
minutes like it's not long at all but I
really really love it so go check it out
on Netflix cuz it's awesome okay the
next thing I'm going to talk about is
the most like this has just had like
such an effect of my life like I just
it's like a reality show but it's on
YouTube guys like you probably know what
I'm talking about by out and if you
don't you need to go check it out it's
called summer break and it's on YouTube
it's just a reality TV show about these
group of teenagers I watched the first
episode
I got so hooked like guys I'm obsessed
with the show I watch the whole series
in the day and obviously they're like
not that long that's on YouTube but
please just watch a few episodes like
even if you don't like the first one
just at least like watch the second one
or the third one it's amazing i love it
i'm obsessed with it and i watch it
every week and it's just so cute oh my
gosh guys please go watch it i'm
obsessed it's like honestly I could go
watch the episodes game the last two
things are actually of food or not
really food I guess who drinks it is
this a vanilla latte Starbucks drink so
basically I'll show you the little
container basically it comes in this big
jug and you can get it at Target or
h-e-b or wherever it's just basically a
vanilla latte flavored from Starbucks
you know and I just put ice in my little
mug or cup whatever you want and you
just pour this in there and it's like
you're having your own iced coffee from
Starbucks and it's my favorite and I
love it guys and go get it if you don't
like Starbucks been like the last thing
is this little berry fruit smoothie mix
you can give them at Target obviously I
was a little target logo but I'm
obsessed with this guy's I love
smoothies and this is dripping like the
water basically you can go to Target and
I'm sure they have them at HEB too but
they're these just mix and it has frozen
fruit in it because I love smoothies but
I don't like cutting up the fruit and I
don't like doing all this stuff and I
feel like it's just too complicated for
me it's probably not that complicated
I'm just really lazy so I just pour that
in the blender I pour the mix in you put
like a cup of milk in there he just
blends it up and it's like the most
amazing smoothies ever had it's like
Jamba Juice in your house and it's often
