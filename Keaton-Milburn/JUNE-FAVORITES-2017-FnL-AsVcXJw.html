have a pimple which is why I'm wearing
this bandana because if it was out right
now it will be shining towards Alan so
the bandana ones covered up did you guys
ever have a pimple I suggest putting a
bandaid on and just cover your hole for
us because then you'll never see any of
them what's up guys so today's video is
obviously going to be my June favorites
I almost didn't know what month away um
if you guys are new here I do a monthly
favorites video and designated for
products and honestly I think that I do
monthly service fees because I genuinely
like just want to talk with you guys I
think there's just such casual videos I
can talk to you guys about things I like
in you guys leave me comments and like
tell me about what you guys like I just
really like their week's videos because
I feel like we're just hanging out
talking about things we like which is
really really fun so if you guys come in
Instagram I definitely recommend to
follow me on Instagram because I don't
know I post a lot and it's really really
fun to keep up with my life anyway let's
get right into this video so the first
thing that we'll talk about is the
touch-ups here one step camomile
cleansing oil so I can't remember if I
talked about this but on say if I
haven't better talk about it again
because absolutely love it this is
basically an oil that I use to take my
makeup off you guys know I live and
breathe it for the bare minerals
cleansing oil honestly I just love oils
that take a makeup off
but this one I've been loving recently
since they sent this to me and it smells
like peppermint it smells like I'm
smells so good I don't know what it is
but it's awesome
and it smells really good I take some
all my makeup and I've just been using
this and replaces my bare minerals
because I ran out of that one so I love
this the next thing is a foundation
which I
rarely changes my foundation I don't
think rarely but like I like to fix that
the same like for like I don't really go
by an in foundation I'll always just try
and stay with the same foundation but I
originally got the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof long wear liquid
foundation I use this in my date night
makeup look and it was so so pretty on
camera I feel like it's really the best
this isn't a shade 4.5 I think I use 5.5
in the other video but this is a little
bit lighter and a little less orange and
I absolutely love the shade it's just
such a great full coverage foundation
that's what I have on today and I just
put it like on my neck but everywhere
stays on literally all day it will not
go off your face like I swear I don't
know why I want to smoke it doesn't
smell good foundation the next thing is
from Too Faced which I absolutely love
Too Faced I just got so much stuff from
them like literally so much I just went
to their headquarters and it was just so
much fun I shot something really really
exciting I can't wait to see you soon
until September though I thought to wait
a while see but I recently got their
love life you light up my life
highlighter it's like in this cute
little gold heart they have two other
shapes but I have been using the gold
one every single day literally of you
today I have about my cheeks right now I
just feel like I was very very scared of
gold tyler's because I know that they
generally just looked yellow on your
cheeks and they just don't look like a
highlight they don't look natural they
just look like a crayon wish you guys
would just try this out to guys
unscriptural gold highlighters I
absolutely loved the way it looked and I
just think it looks glowy for summer
it's beautiful
almost a highlight the next thing is
also to face with this I am actually
obsessed I think this is a genius like I
think this idea is amazing so this is a
toothpaste hangover 3 and 1 replenishing
primer not primer settings right
replenishing primer and setting spray it
could be both you can put on before your
makeup or after I need it for after
which like I absolutely love this if you
guys are super into the hangover primer
I highly suggest getting the setting
spray with it because what it smells
like coconuts like if you guys want some
primer you know what kind of some
this smells like coconuts accessor
makeup it stays on all day and I just
think it's I like sets I like having a
matching primer and a setting spread it
like that they come together and weird
like that but I really do recommend if
you have to look for a new setting spray
definitely it be hangover one the last
makeup product is the KK beauty not take
a GD sorry this is the kick aw look
little sick in collaboration with Kylie
this is like the nude ones that can
release and this is in the shade
Kimberly I actually love this it's a
really really pretty nude and I was
really confused by the formula of these
I watched so many reviews and swatches
and like tutorials on how to use these
lipsticks and I still didn't understand
until I put them on but it absolutely
love this I also just ordered be like
vacation set like the eye shadow and the
liquid lipsticks or a video that I
really really want to do and have it
come in the mail yet so if you guys are
wanting to see a makeup tutorial with
the Kylie cosmetics eyeshadows the new
vacation one I'm doing that really soon
I've worn the new shade of this one all
month and absolutely I have a lot health
everything I'm showing you guys I really
have on my face right now
okay so the next thing actually really
love this is the Blitz blood orange plus
white paper sugar scrub so this is
basically obviously a body scrub oh I
think it just flew in my eye oh my gosh
it literally smells like a grapefruit
like oranges like citrus it's literally
blood orange and white pepper and it
smells like a grapefruit and orange it
smells so so good and the consistency of
this body scrub is so amazing it's like
I can't even describe
I get spray tans and when I need to
exfoliate after I get my freakin I have
to use this stuff and you can use as
much of it as you possibly want and like
this thing is still full I absolutely
love it I don't know why I don't like I
don't know what I was ever doing without
this in my life but if you guys are
looking for bio scrubs you guys just
like body scrubs in general definitely
recommend these I'm not sure if they
have other sins it's just it's so good
okay so the last two things are
jewelry's they are both from the brand
sponsored you guys haven't fallen yet
answer
you guys know I posted up let's picture
here I've been wearing like a ton of
layer jewelry and I have been
consistently wearing this necklace this
is the necklace I'm gonna hold it up
tonight guys can see it's like this
and it has stars all on this and then I
have one star here it just looks so so
pretty on especially layered with a
bunch of other necklaces and the brand
is sponsor I will link them down below
if you guys want to get necklaces but
they also have this one which it's super
cool and I thought this one was just
like different and edgy so this is that
this looks so long this is the necklace
and it basically has these two cuffs so
they look like they look like cuffs to
me I call them handcuffs but they're
just honestly like clips and you wrap
the necklace so this is like what it
looks like you can do it like some in
different ways I made it like a really
tight choker and just have like the
cuffs like here you can do it so many
different ways I just I call them cuffs
or literally not cuffs so that's what
they look like to me I do think it's a
little bit edgier and it's different to
have just like an Michael and stuff like
that especially Larry's with a bunch of
other gold jewelry I think this is super
cool and I just like that it can like
unclip you can do like whatever you want
with it I just think it's a really cool
idea so this is also from fonts are and
I will be done with my last day of the
month is shameless so I actually just
finished the Network series shameless a
lot of you guys watch it because you
always are telling me about it and
always always tweeting about shameless
like if I'm watching the show you guys
will know because I'll always be
tweeting like updates and like how I'm
feeling about the character so

love talking you guys about like the
show that we like basically watched
together it's like so fun but I just
been a shameless and I was doing my
makeup while watching the finale
shameless and I was like crying like I
was just like why am i eating they make
a braid out like this is so unacceptable
but it's so so good and I don't know how
I feel like I just don't think that I
could wait a year for another piece of
machine look I'm so emotionally attached
to whip and feel that I love less oh my
God look it's literally go off and love
iane I love Fiona I'm honestly starting
to really get into Frank like he's
honestly like warming up to me I feel
like
