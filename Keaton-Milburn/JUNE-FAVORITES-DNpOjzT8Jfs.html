be a June favorites for you I think I
think it's a new favorites video I'm so
excited to be filming this for you guys
because like I was at a favorites video
it's a long so I upon my favorites video
today obviously you guys know my
favorites video is I haven't done one in
a while because yeah let's get into it
my arm is like in the mirror back there
okay so the first thing that I wanted
two guys about is big okay so this is
the Make Up For Ever HD high definition
foundation in the shade in 170 and this
is what I'm wearing right now this
matches my skin with a spray tan
perfectly i have the lighter foundation
that I used when I doin have a spray tan
and I don't spray tan my face so when I
found this I was like this is the best
thing ever because it's much more full
coverage than my other foundation which
I have is the mac foundation it's much
more full coverage than that so I use
that when i'm like more pale because
whatever always and then i use this when
I want to cover up the paleness like
when I have photo shoots and stuff like
that like today or sometimes when I'm
filming I use it most of the time I do
use the mac one though but this one has
been like the best this month I bought
it and I don't even think I've used that
much I'm gonna try to see I don't know I
open the cap to see but i really really
love this foundation and it's just been
working that makes it next is a lipstick
and I know you guys have like never seen
me with like red lipstick on but um that
is actually not the lips like that i'm
gonna show you guys i'm actually going
to show you this one it is from and this
was in my last video of my QA i don't
know how to pronounce it mhr I must be
stupid but this is it and it's just
another nude pink like I need another
pink I don't need another nude pink but
this one's so pretty and then I saw in
mac and i really didn't need it at all i
just really wanted to buy it and i've
been wearing it a lot recently because
when i do lighter makeup it's good to
like not do something so like full on my
lips I don't know I just wanted like a
nice nude to go with that make up that
slider during the summer so this isn't
working really really good next I really
can't remember if i've talked to you
guys about these or not but I'm gonna
talk to you about them again because
loves of my life I may have shown them
in a hall or maybe I showed them in
favorites for you I learned they don't
remember but I love them so much in this
summer like seriously this month in
particular because I've been driven to
make up a lot more this month because
I've been taking like lots of pictures
and doing all that kind of stuff this
beautiful palette shade enlightens no
valid whatever you need uru things it's
a cap on the shade and light palette and
I've been using this shade right here
this one to like contour and that's what
i've been using down my neck for because
it's like a greater tone so i use it
kind of as a shadow I don't even know
why I do that and then this is a
two-faced chocolate bar palette I showed
this in another hall i believe i've been
using this a lot i have it on my eyes
right here i've been using this um like
ever since i bought it but this month in
particular because I've been doing my
makeup so much this month like it's like
every single day which is kind of
annoying but some days I have to and so
I've been using this right now i have
the moose shade i have cocoa chill and
then i have butter pecan and i have that
all my guys at the moment and this smell
never goes away it smells just like the
next thing i want to talk to you guys
about is not a makeup product it is like
a little skin care product i was going
to say
this is the moisturizers the Clinique
more shares if you guys remember i
bought this like a long time ago i was
like i'm gonna try it out I don't know
if I like it I love it and it's in this
little tiny cuz i got the sample whoa
because i wasn't sure if i would like it
and i actually really really love it but
it is kind of expensive so i'm going to
go back and like debate on buying it
when i go and support next if you guys
know any really really good moisturizers
leave them in the comments down below
like I'm so serious I'm always doing it
guys comments for like new products and
stuff and I want to find a new
moisturizer like this may be less
expensive though because i'm not sure i
spend how much that is all for makeup
and skincare now moving on to a clothing
