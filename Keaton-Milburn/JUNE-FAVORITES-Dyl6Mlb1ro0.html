much but I'm getting my hair dyed so
that it's much more blonde than it is if
you like I'm really like slowly going
brunette and I do not want that to
happen not that I don't like brunettes
but I just like my hair blonde so I'm
being it died
what's up guys I missed you so much I
look like a bodybuilder at this shirt
looks like it's like a muscle tee it's
not it's like a crop I don't even oh
what's up guys I missed you I know it's
like oh I've been posting like vlogs and
stuff but honestly I haven't sat down
and filmed a video like three weeks
because all my other videos were like
pre whatever so finding youtuber stuff
anyway so today I'm going to be telling
you at my what month what's going on
June my June favorites I'm actually so
excited to tell you guys all these
things like ever I had so many favorites
this month and I genuinely like really
liked all these items out that I don't
normally but like these items are some
reason have just made my life like great
okay I got my life together it's all
here gang is all freaking oh so okay so
the first favor I'm going to show you
guys this another Kylie lip kit but I'm
genuinely like I seriously love this
stuff this is exposed by Kylie I just
also bought block of night and I bought
22 and I bought King something the gold
whatever metallic one but this one I
think I wore like every single day for
like literally the whole month of June I
just really loved it also fun note I
tweeted it intact Kylie and Kylie
cosmetics retweeted my selfie feel like
it it's on her Twitter
so anyway moving on I had to just like
put that out there it really made me
excited but I really really love this
stuff and honestly it's being so nice
percent honest there are some lip kits
and the formula I'm like okay this is
poochie's like you suck but this formula
is really good I don't know if it's
because it's a newer one or something
but there's some that are like trash but
this one is so good so props to you the
next makeup item is the other side to
have everything else clear brow gel and
this is like not a new item that people
are talking about people of house for
quite a while but I've just recently
purchased it because I ran out of brow
gel and this stuff is so good like it's
literally the brush is good like this is
just popping freakin clear brow gel and
it keeps my brows in place which I've
recently no done this often and they
look a lot better than what we did I'm
learning how to link sheep they're like
a normal human being so I like this
next thing I'm showing you guys and you
guys are going to that Keaton stop we
get it you fake tan but like I'm always
getting new tanning products because I
like to be not my real skin colors so
this is by loving tan and this is the
deluxe bronzing mousse in dark I brought
this with me on my trip to year because
I was there for 13 days and I knew that
the spray tan that I had had when I went
there was going to wear off and I was
going to be pale and ghostly so this is
really good for traveling obviously it's
not like a trouble sighs it's 4 fluid
ounces but I checked the bag so I
brought this with me I just think it's
really good for like if you need like a
really quick like tan like it lasts a
while but also it's just good if you
need like say I don't spare my face
normally if I want to have my face
darker like if I'm not gonna wear makeup
and my face is white and my body is dark
then I want to use like a mousse like
this over my face and like down like my
chest and stuff like that to make it
tanner next thing I'm talking about is
actually probably one of my favorite
things out of this whole freaking
favorites thing these are shred tats and
I have so many guys but my fave
are these PR is VR what was that English
these are the white trackpads
and these are the prettiest things I
posted a picture on my Instagram I'll
post a different one right here so you
guys can see what they look like on and
I brought these with me to Europe and
like while I was there I gave them to
all my friends I was like guys put all
these on and seriously like everyone
loved him I got so many compliments on
them and I just think they're really
cute and fun especially for the summer
because like when you're in school
you're not gonna like walk up to school
with like a tank top with like a drive
top like English keep English so it's
like more like a summer thing like they
look really cool in the summer when
you're like at the beach or tan in here
some like that so I thought these are
really pretty and also a little side
note and this one it says Mykonos on it
just like tribe testa and I wore them
when I was on anyway I'll link these
down below I also will post their like
Instagram and all that because you
should go follow them they're really
dope and if you guys haven't ever worn
them they're so easy while I'm just
gonna talk about here at this whole
video when I was in Europe I had to take
an 11 hour flight
um like back and then had another
four-hour flight I was flying a ton it's
like literally it's a lot of fun so I
read like the whole time I read three
books on my trip to Europe so the first
one that I read was far from you by
touchstart and this book is so I
originally bought it thinking that it
was like a love story book it's
definitely not a love story book like I
thought it was romance and I don't know
why I bought it and thought that it was
romance but it's not it's more like a
mystery kind of thing but it's not like
a cheesy like a weird mystery it's
really really interesting and cool and I
think if you guys like those kind of
books are really good I don't know I
really liked it I'm not gonna tell you
guys what it's all about because just go
by it and read it like I did the second
book that I read is pointed retreat so
if you guys have not read slammed you
guys probably won't understand this but
slams point of retreat and this girl are
like a trio of books or whatever they're
called a series of books and they are by
Colleen Hoover Colleen Hoover is awesome
I seriously like I look for I love her
books for writing everything and I
remember I read slammed like a year ago
and then I didn't realize that I bought
point of a tree
never read it so I read poetry and I
almost died reading poetry it was so
good and then I read this girl but this
girl is not like a third one to the
series it's the first one again when in
the guys perspective which I really like
the guys perspective more if you guys
have read these books comment the
comments down below if which book was
your favorite and stuff like that
because I love both talked with you guys
I actually read a lot and so I don't
really talk about a lot of books on my
channel but I do like to read pretty
often I'm reading another book right now
called say what you will I think that's
what it's called it's on the iPad so I
don't have it but I'm not done with it
if you guys want to hear about it when
I'm done it'll probably be a favorites
video next moving on to music my
favorite album from this month has got
to be dangerous woman oh my gosh guys
Eren gonna like what how does she every
single time she makes an album I
literally like listen to it on repeat
and cry I don't understand my favorites
from the album have to be new better
forever boy think about you I like I
don't care I like sometimes I like
moonlight the other ones that are like
more pop I liked them but they're not
ones like I really like jam to that much
I really like those also you guys know
I'm like the biggest dick shots like my
favorite rapper champions came out it
has Kanye West gucci mane big sean like
all these little rappers to change stuff
on it
that sounds really good on my Spotify I
made a June favorites playlist if it
will load on my June favorites playlist
I put around Grande's songs obviously I
also put Trap House by Tory Lanez
I really like that song cheap thrills by
SIA guys go freaking listen to that song
the whole time we were in Europe again
like clubbing just a reference Europe
for this whole video it's a whole time
we're in Europe every club we went to
was playing this song and I have never
like jam to a song so hard in my life
I'm so good I'll also put a few young
duck songs on here if you guys like
young thug not everyone was into him but
