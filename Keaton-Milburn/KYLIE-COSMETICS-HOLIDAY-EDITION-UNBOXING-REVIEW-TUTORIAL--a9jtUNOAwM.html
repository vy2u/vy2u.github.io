changed into a sweatshirt and now really
hot oh we Scott Taco Bell is literally
so mom and having had Mountain Dew since
I was probably like 5 good what's up
guys today's video is going to be a
video all about the Holiday Collection
kinda Kylie alia collection
scratch that all about the Kylie holiday
collection box and this basically costs
an arm and a leg so yeah I got this for
Christmas though so I'll shut up to you
mom you a rock for buying with this I
wanted it so about like a almost like
saved all my money up mm like seventh
grade just for this one box
I'm the minimum one fee for Christmas so
like hashtag blessed I'm gonna show you
guys everything that is in this box I
have only used like two things in here
at all so this is really going to be a
first impression sash like unbox gee I
don't know today my unboxing first
impressions swatches I make up tutorial
lip come up whatever you want to call
this this is just like random but
basically you just slide this little the
only colors I've use from this are angel
and brown sugar just because I really
was too excited to try them out and then
I also did use the white eyeliner one
day just because I was like oh let's see
how this is but everything else I have
yet to use so I'm going to show you guys
or I'm gonna tell you guys everything
that's in here
so the first shade is Koko K which I
don't actually have I have a lot of
Kylie lip kits but I don't have a lot of
the ones in here this one is Kandy K
which I do have and I love it
this one is angel which candy cane angel
are so so similar I will swatch them all
though so you guys will be able to tell
this one is brown sugar which I really
really like the way that one looks the
pumpkin one isn't really holidays I
think she just include
in their case anyone didn't get like
pumpkin what you went out with it and
then this one is Mary which I'm super
excited about because I have Mary Jo K
and I really don't like the like formula
of it it's really terrible so I'm hoping
that this bread will be a lot better
this one is jolly and this is a cloth
actually and I really love that because
I have a really pretty very lip color
that would look really pretty with that
and then it has vixen which the vixen
and jolly look like they would also be
really pretty together the gloss in
naughty which is red which could also go
over Mary and then the last one is ochre
and this one is Khloe's shade which I'm
actually I'm not like too excited about
the actual color of it just because I'm
not I'm not like a hot pink kind of
person but I really love Chloe so much
so like I'm down also these little I
have like three colored eyeshadows but I
cannot get them out because I have to
make nails and they're too long like I'm
not even doing this for like comedic
effect like this is a legit I can't get
this out hey mom can you help me with
something really quick I literally can't
grab them out and I need to take them
out can you get them like you see what
I'm saying my nails okay now that that's
over I'm gonna show you guys what's in
here so this one is the Chi liner in
snow and this is really pretty I
probably won't use the pot form of this
just because I'm not very good with like
a like liner pencil I just I
like the elastic to the eyepencil these
are what are they even called though
like the actual name of it I just know
they're like cream eyeshadows this one
is in Golden plum this is yellow gold
and camo oh God
the last thing in the box I am most
excited about this the holiday edition
Kylie Kyoto and this is the main thing
that I wanted because I have the
burgundy palette and I love the burgundy
felt like I'm not even just saying that
I truly like I'm obsessed but this is
what it looks like again the teardrops
on her eyes match all of the shades that
are in the collection and it comes with
a mirror so she's really she's really
stepping her game up I I have not used
any of these colors before like I think
I just watched one and it's like this
one on the bottom sugar cookie frosty
chestnut Nutcracker winter mittens
silent night evergreen and gingerbread
are all of the shades on here so they're
all winter Christmas whatever theme but
I mean anyway like it doesn't matter if
it's Christmas these are so pretty so
I'm gonna be showing you guys one eye
shadow month I'm creating with just this
palette and I'm going to be using the
eyeliner and then I am going to show you
three different lip looks that you can
wear with this eye shadow from like my
favorites from this collection I
honestly am so hyped that this has a
mirror because I would always want to
travel with just my burgundy palette and
it was so annoying because I'd have to
take another palette out of my bag and
like you use the mirror on it when I
traveled and I'm just like this it's a
blessing I can just even sit right here
oh I'm going to be taking sugar cookie
which is this top left shake and I'm
just gonna set my eyelid just because I
always do that
and I need powder up there so that is
what we're gonna do I honestly have not
even looked at these colors so whatever
it is a look is please don't like flame
me for like all these for this makeup
look because this really might be trash
I'm gonna go in with chestnut which is
this top right top yeah top right and
I'm just gonna put this in my crease and
see how it blends out I really love the
matte shades and the burgundy palette
but I didn't really like the ones with
like shimmer and then they just like
really did not have that much pigment so
let's hope that she stepped it up with
this product I really like this bottom
right shade I think it is silent night
so I'm gonna take that shade and I want
to try and like packet
like that actually I'm gonna go back in
with chestnut this top right shade over
here and I'm just gonna make sure that
they blend at the top nice my camera
keeps stopping like legit every 10
seconds it stops but I swatch it on the
back and I really actually do love this
plum color so we're just gonna put this
all over the lid mainly in like the
center and inner corner but
when it says cream eyeshadow like it
really is super creamy it's not hard to
blend I think I want this yeah I'm
probably gonna do more looks with this
palette because this is like a really I
don't know just like basic smoky plum
eye whatever it's called so if you guys
want to see like other looks with this
palette I will do some because I know
this is just like whatever but now I'm
gonna go back in with this bottom right
shade and I'm gonna smudge it all
underneath my lower lash line just cuz
you know that's what I'm feeling I poked
myself in the eye I do have to say
though the shimmer colors in this
palette are so much better than the
burgundy palette like the last one it
was like I really really had to try to
get anything out of this palette like
out of the shimmers on the last palette
but this one it's so easy like I'm
really I'm really here for this about it
I really am I kind of want to use I want
to use the silver color right here it is
frosty and I want to add a little bit
more dimension so I'm like lightly
tapping it because it's pigmented I'm
gonna put it in the center of my eye
okay so I added some white eyeliner I
added mascara the eyes are done and I
really actually like this I'm actually
instant I wasn't planning on doing like
a smokier eye shadow look today I kind
of wanted to like the blue and green but
I think I'm going to save that for
another video just cuz I don't know I
want to do a whole separate look with
that and I also probably want to use
more than just kinda cosmetics products
and I'm only using Kylie products in
this video so moving on let's pick a lip
color first I'm going to try out angel
for you guys because I have used candy
cane and coke okay but angel and not a
lot of people have like worn this one so
I'm going to put this one on and really
quickly for you guys so I just applied
angel and actually really like this it
is a lot different than candy cane I
thought they were too similar but ash is
a lot different because this is like a
deeper like it's a darker bubblegum pink
I feel like it's not so much candy K
it's actually super light on me
personally my skin tone it looks a
little bit more light but I really like
this because it's like I don't know how
to describe it but I brought you us a
bit closer because you couldn't really
tell from that far away but this is from
sugar actually really like this shading
I think it's my favorite just because I
like darker colors and it kind of
reminds me of Dolce K but the formula on
brown sugar there's so much better with
Dolce K it's so patchy like I would
apply one layer because I still see my
real lip color underneath it and it
wasn't working this one it's like one
layer feels so soft it's not sticky at
all like no it doesn't feel sticky after
I went to go take Angela that one felt
really really cakey on my lips like it
just felt like it all clumped together I
don't know if I didn't apply like right
amount of it but it just felt really
cakey
I still like the shade of it a lot but
this one feels so much better I don't
know I just really really like this
shade so yeah that's what this so this
is jolly and vixen together so this is a
super dark lip it almost looks black on
camera it's not black it's like super
deep plum and the gloss the Jolly gloss
matches vixen perfectly so it looks
really really good together obviously I
don't feel like this is really my look
probably not with purple hair it's it on
my look but I really wanted to try out a
lot of colors that were more out of my
comfort zone that's why I'm not putting
on coke okay and all the other ones just
because I wanted to do something that's
out of my comfort zone like brown sugar
and vixen and jolly already so
pumpkin I actually really like this one
I did not expect to like this that much
but actually really liked it it is a
very fall color obviously its pumpkin it
came out like in October so it is really
fall but I still think it's really
pretty
maybe with like a more like round smokey
eye not so plum but I really love this
color and the formula like the
consistency of it is perfect it feels
just like brown sugar did I don't know
why angel that one was so weird but this
one is really really good actually love
this it's probably so that is everything
that is in the Holiday Collection Kylie
box I hope you guys liked this video it
was so highly requested so I know
everything I showed I only showed like a
few lip colors and I did one eye look
