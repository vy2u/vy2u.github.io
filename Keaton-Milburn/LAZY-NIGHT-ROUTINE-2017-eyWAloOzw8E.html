obviously going to be my lazy night
routine so thank you so much to
neutrogena for sponsoring this video I'm
so so excited to be working with them
and I'm just really excited to show you
how I collaborated with them and this
video so thank you to Neutrogena
so this is obviously going to be me
coming home from a late night owl so
this is when I come home and I'm
literally so lazy and so tired that this
is how I get ready for bed so I figured
I would show you guys that in today's
video so yeah let's just get into it oh
my gosh thank you so excited to wake up
in the okay I'm going to sleep good
night see you in the morning is she
bringing us coffee
okay good night hey Shawn thanks for
loading my car up it looks good
thank you and I really want to film this
earlier in this summer but I just never
got around to doing it and I literally
leave for Arizona at 8:30 in the morning
tomorrow and it's currently like 11:30
at night and I am so freakin exhausted
you guys don't understand I have too
long to stay in my life just like
packing and doing everything to move
back to Arizona I also got my hair dyed
today that's like super super white um
my hair is legitimately gray like I am
so sure that the fact that it looks like
this you guys watch my babies guys no I
absolutely love names Eugenia and I'm
going to be showing you how I use their
makeup wipes tonight to take off all
this makeup because I literally too
tired like you know those nice
like a party or you come out from
somewhere and you're just like so dead
and it's like should I just go to sleep
with the makeup on and then you're like
no don't and then you just have to take
it off because you know you're gonna
regret it in the morning that's how I'm
feeling right now
and the Neutrogena is makeup wipes are
and vigo too so that's how money is the
reason I'm really excited to show you
guys this is because it literally takes
all my makeup off and it's in like one
swipe like I'm gonna show you guys you
guys are gonna see because my foundation
is like orange but my face is white
literally guys like you've got to be
joking and look like I'm wearing a mask
when I take my makeup off like it is
ridiculous also I really love the
feeling that these wipes leave after I
take my makeup off what's really good
about these wipes is that they actually
remove waterproof mascara which not a
lot of the makeup wipes do it normally
is really hard to get it off but I'm
gonna show you guys like this is it
are you joking like that literally took
mmm like all of my eyeshadow off but
it's so easy guys and I'm just so tired
that I don't even care okay so now that
my makeups off I'm going to take my
contacts out because if I sleep in my
contacts Oh wake up
so Wragge oh my god
over to go - oh my god thank you
my gosh guys you've gotta be kidding did
so on my eye is it so my eye we might
contact this fella
oh I thought it fell out onto the floor
I was still kind of you guys what is my
life right now I'm just too tired to
function no time to take my jewelry off
get ready for bed
here are my cute little glasses guys
look like actual grandmother cuz I have
a gray hair and glasses on now honestly
think God for those new to you no makeup
wipes because that made taking my makeup
off so much easier and the fact that I
could literally be like laying in bed
just taking my makeup off with that wife
and then going sure to sleep like it is
amazing it's amazing now for pajamas I'm
gonna wear my favorite pajama pants
they're from Urban Outfitters and I'm
honestly probably gonna wear this
t-shirt that I wore like all today
because I'm just so tired and lazy okay
so I lied I decided to sleep in a sports
bra instead but fun fact about me when I
turn my light off so I can wash my bed
I'm too scared to walk in the dirt so
always turn my flow flow no phone
flashlights on turn the light off and
then I like guide my way through my room
because I'm just too scared to walk in
the dark I hate it so most of the time
at night I obviously oh they keep this
like flashlight on while I'm editing and
stuff I don't like to turn my flashlight
on my phone off till I'm literally dead
asleep but I watch Netflix this is
currently puss in Newtons that's not
what I was watching
I literally watched Forensic Files but
normally if it's nighttime I like to
watch a happy movie so I'll watch Moana
or I'll normally watch trolls I don't
know where
is on here but I literally you'd
normally watch mana or trolls every
single night like it's literally only
those two all right debate between just
because I like to have happy movies on
but I just like play those as I fall
asleep this is something I wanted to
include in my network team because I
want to know if any of you guys are like
me so I sleep talk every single night so
when I say every single night I
literally mean every single night and I
know this because every time I've always
slept with anyone like my mom or my
sister or someone they've always been
like you sleep dog every single night
you talk to us in your sleep but I'm
like no I don't so I found this sleep
talking app it's called sleep talk
recorder it looks like this the app is
red and basically it records all night
in my sleep so if I start to say
anything while I'm asleep it will pick
it up so the next morning I always go
back and I listen to my recordings and
guys look at this I have a favorite
sections there's so many like I have so
many of me talking and I'm thinking
about making like a whole video on like
the stuff that I say oh I see because
it's so funny but I want to include that
in this night routine because it is part
of my night routine every single night I
will go here and I will click this
button and I will start recording and I
will go to sleep and it's really really
fun because in the morning I get to hear
what I said but I just figured I would
include that so I hope you guys liked
today's video I know it's like just
really short and super random so thank
you so much to a neutrogena for
sponsoring this video I will leave
everything linked down below you guys
can go check them out I absolutely love
their products like I genuinely
genuinely do actually use these wipes
like almost every single night I say
this is my lazy night routine but like
literally my lazy night routine it's
like every single night like I don't
have a normal and I everdene anyways
guys I hope you guys like this view
please please please give it a big
thumbs up if you guys did live it live

below I am going to press record on my
sleep talking and literally pass out
right now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
