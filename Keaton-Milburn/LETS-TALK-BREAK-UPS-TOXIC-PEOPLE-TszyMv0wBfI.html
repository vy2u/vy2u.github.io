but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys today's video is going to
be just a little chitchat video and
advice video you guys ask me questions
on my tumblr I always do it on my tumblr
so that you guys can ask me and not miss
questions because I know sometimes
uncomfortable like tweeting me your name
with like advice you guys have fast so I
always ask you to do it on my tumblr if
you guys didn't see that I was filming
this video you might want to follow my
Instagram and Twitter because I post it
on my Instagram a link to where you
could ask me questions and I also
tweeted that I was filming this video so
if you guys missed that you might want
to follow me on Instagram and Twitter
and I'm just always updating on there so
you guys might as well follow me anyway
I have my laptop right here and all the
questions you guys have asked me so I'm
just gonna start reading them off
I love filming these kinds of videos I
did this last year I think around this
time it just makes me I feel like closer
to you guys like I just want this to be
a super chill video like I'm just your
friend and you guys are just asking me a
question like oh my gosh this boy is
cute do you think I should and I'm like
I just wanted to be super casual sorry
I'm fixing my necklaces anyway let's
just get into it how do you get over a
boy who sucks and isn't good for you and
make him regret doing you wrong
getting over anybody is really hard but
I feel like getting over somebody who
treated you badly is even worse because
you're just like you still want them for
some reason and you just don't know why
because they're like literally the worst
I personally just like to take time to
focus on myself like I want them to
realize like with or without them like I
am going to do better like I'm going to
glow up I'm going to prosper I'm still
gonna live my life doing every single
thing I was already doing with that
person but I'm also gonna do it like 10
times better without them I portray a
person that is so strong and is still
doing anything that they can without
that person cuz I don't want to let that
person know that like they hurt me which
that might not be a good way to go about
it but just like for me that always
makes the other person realize like oh
hey like I know we're not together
anymore and I like treated you badly but
like you're still doing good like why
you know and like that's kind of like my
thought process so I think my main
advice would be focus on yourself
do better work harder at the things that
make you happy and you will have like an
inward happiness that will show outward
and then that person will be like what
the heck you're like over me and like
doing better like I don't
and how are you build up confidence
again when you've had a bad week and
your face is breaking out and you just
feel flat in other words love your
channel
I have weeks all the time where I'm just
feeling like super gross and not myself
and I feel like I look at everyone else
and I'm just like oh my god like they
probably just like look great all the
time and I feel like some of you guys
think that about me and you're like oh
she thinks like this all the time I
literally feel like crap today I almost
didn't even film this video because I
was like I don't have a spray tan my
eyebrows aren't done my makeup looks
like crap my hair is short of it's not
curled the way I wanted to like I just
have a lot of insecurities about myself
and I feel like everyone also has
insecurities so I feel like coming back
from a week of just like this week I'm
just like not feeling cute like I'm just
like not on my a-game and that's okay I
feel like everyone has off weeks where
they just like look in the mirror
they're just like girl you need help and
like that is how I feel as much as I
feel confident with my makeup on and I
feel confident all dressed up and I feel
confident like with a spray tan or with
my hair curled or something I try and do
things that make me happy without it
being like materialistic things or
things that are on the outward like I
will literally go and drive one listen
to music for like an hour and a half and
just focus on like myself I pray a lot
when I'm feeling like gross about myself
I know that sounds weird but I pray a
lot and I'm just like God like help me
not care like what I am on the outside
like help me like focus on things that
make me happy and not just like what I
look like because I shouldn't care so
much about what I look like
I definitely 110 percent do not feel
cute right now and that's like part of
the reason I want to film this video is
I wanted to see how comfortable I was
with filming a video when I don't feel
my best and I don't feel cute or pretty
or confident and I want to see if I
could thumb this video and edit it and
still upload it for you guys you know
I'm not feeling cute but I just want you
guys to know that everyone has those
days I'm having one of those days right
now where I just feel like crap and not
cute but I'm filming anyway for you guys
because you guys except me you guys know
me you love me advice I'm talking to
eggs don't no but seriously I definitely
don't recommend it I think it's good to
be on like good terms and like
acquaintances I don't mean the whole
like let's stay friends thing like I
like that's not for me like I definitely
have a good relationship with my exes
like we are good acquaintances if I see
them out I'm obviously gonna be that guy
how are you but I'm not gonna be like
texting every day like a bunch of
nonsense or like be your best friend
snapchat like that's not what I'm trying
to do and I feel like that is the
distance people need to keep from their
exes because the second you give back
into like oh well we could be friends
but like whoa like maybe we should like
start over then it just like opens your
mind up to other things and I don't feel
like that's a good place to be so I
would recommend not talking to your ex
unless it's like super mutual
acquaintance thing because one person
always wants more out of the other
person than the other and that's just
how it works how do you let go of
negative people in your life that you
once cared for and maybe still do I feel
like I am a very caring person and I'm
always going to care about someone even
if they hurt me really badly I just
don't have a place in like my heart to
just be like if you you suck get out of
my life forever like you're the worst
ever like even though someone hurts me I
just really tried to distance myself and
I also kind of like to remind myself
like if this person really cared for me
the way that I cared for them they
wouldn't be treating me so negatively
like they wouldn't be treating me the
way they are if you care about somebody
it should just come naturally to you to
treat them right and not negative and
like not ignore them or not like treat
them wrong so I just always try to
remember if I'm cutting someone in my
life and I already have and yeah I might
think about them from time to time and
be like oh I wonder what they're doing
their steps that's not wrong for you to
like think about like an X or like an
old friend that you had in your life
that's okay because like you're human
and you're going to care about them it's
just keeping your distance because you
know that they've hurt you and even if
they've apologized
I still keep my distance even if you
forgive them it's okay
to go like this any advice for slightly
toxic friends I love my friends and most
of time have funding out with them but
they feel bad about myself for example
one friend in particular always tells me
I'm too thin and that's not pewter makes
fun of me for being a virgin even though
she is - I don't know what to do because
I value our friendship but her hurtful
comments and actions are getting out of
hand I've definitely had like friends
say like negative comments to me even if
it's in a joking way because they're
your friend they're your best friend and
they're just joking about it if a friend
is making rude jokes towards you and
like the whole comment about like making
fun of you for being a virgin even
though she is - it's like she might have
insecurities that she doesn't really
know how to do and so it's just like oh
I can bully you because like we're the
same and like you know it's just things
like that I definitely have like sad -
friends like hey honestly like that is
not funny to me like I don't think it's
funny when you make fun of me or nervous
or like if I wear a certain outfit and
like someone's like oh why are you
wearing that it's like okay because I
want you like if you're my friend don't
be rude and I think bullying me about it
I feel like just like a simple comment
like nothing that's a big deal I don't
think like a 5 paragraph like text
message to your friend being like oh my
gosh you say all this means stuff all
timerlay if I'm feeling someone secure
now I think just in the moment like the
next time your friend says a comment to
you that like might hurt your feelings I
would just say like hey that was like
not that funny like I know I sound like
a little kid right now but I would
honestly just be like okay like that's
not that funny that honestly like hurts
my feelings can you like not make
comments about me being like to dead are
like too big or like me being a virgin
like just don't say stuff like that and
if they take it they understand they can
take criticism and they'll be like okay
links are whatever if they don't then
like that's not the kind of friend you
need in your life - just like
consistently pull you after you've said
like you don't like being made fun of or
like harass like that like that's just
not a friend you need anyway I have the
exact same use you don't drink a virgin
and God is very important to me I'm also
in a very social sorority I feel like
that people think that just because I
don't do certain things that I'm not fun
it makes me not want to go out because
I'm constantly being questioned about it
and people think it's impossible to have
fun sober like no one understands and
there's no one I can talk to about this
do you feel like people judge you for
this and if so how do you handle it
I definitely think it's a very different
dynamic like being with a group of
people who like always go out and you're
like I want to go out too and they're
like I'll help but you don't drink it's
like okay but I'm a girl and I'm gonna
sorority and I like to have fun I'm in
college like obviously I still want to
go out and like honestly I go out all
the time like I go out with my friends
when I feel like it if I just like want
to go have fun like I do that and like
yes I don't drink but like I'm thankful
enough that I have friends who
understand that I don't drink and I feel
like sometimes you do get the stigma
that people think because you don't
drink or because you go here they're
like oh that's fun for you you're sober
like you must not be fun if you go out
and like I have so much fun when I'm
going out and most of the time people
don't even know I'm sober until I tell
them so I try not make it a big deal
because I do have people coming to your
party like oh you're not drinking like
it's probably so boring buna bleah no
actually it's not like I know how to
have fun without drinking and a lot of
the times people are like oh I respect
that like you don't drink like I wish I
was like that like people tell me that
all the time that's like the number one
thing I get is like oh I wish I was like
that which like they probably don't but
they're just like trying to like
compliment you like me nice I just try
to ignore it I invited myself places as
much as possible if my friends are going
on like hey I want to come it's just
like up to me whether I make an effort
to go out or not and like have fun it's
up to me whether I want to have fun
how to get over a guy who isn't giving
you the amount of time and appreciation
you deserve
I've definitely like been interested in
people and like wanted to talk to them
before that we're just like not as and
you're sitting me and just like weren't
giving me as much attention as I wanted
and it is really really hard to like not
reach out to them and just be like hey
like why are you showing me attention
and are like you know you just want to
like hang out with them and like they
just aren't as interested in you
you have to realize they're not the only
person that you're ever going to like in
the world it might just be a minor crush
you might actually really like them a
lot but they're not the only person they
are just a phase of your life and if
they're not giving you the attention
that you want or they're not giving you
the time of day then they're just not
the one for you and like that's super
simple and like cliche but they just are
you just have to learn where you put
your energy you can't keep putting your
energy into somebody who is not giving
you any energy back and like that's just
my number one thing is like don't be so
invested in somebody who is literally
not giving you anything back they're not
reciprocating at all because in the end
you're just going to end up being like
okay well I did all of this and you
literally did nothing for me and it's
just gonna feel really really bad at the
end of the day I'm in love with someone
what the girlfriend after talking for
quite some time I know he feels the same
way about me as I do him and our
connection is so ro but I guess he's
afraid to leave his girlfriend up the
years because of the time and life
they've shared what do I do personally
and I'm going to be like super honest
and like open with you about this I
don't think that this person is a very
good person even though you have
probably had amazing conversations with
them and they've treated you well and
they've you know done stuff for you I
just feel like if you are in a
relationship with somebody for three
years and they're like oh I don't want
to leave them it's like that is not
somebody you want you don't want to like
get in a relationship with this person
and then y'all date for three years and
three years there and they're like oh
well I was kind of like in love with
this other person this whole time you
know like you just don't want that like
bad karma like honestly I feel like
everything comes full circle talking to
somebody who is in a relationship having
feelings for someone who's in
relationship is never healthy because
it's like they either are never going to
leave the person who they're with or
they're going to leave the person
they're with and end up hurting you in
the end so I just feel like that it's
just a very toxic situation I personally
would not stay interested in this person
I would try and bond and try and like
talk to someone else and they probably
will get jealous if you start talking to
someone else but that's not fair because
they're in a relationship so you have to
keep that in mind totally up to you what
you want to do I personally would not
invest too much time into someone who is
already in a relationship how does your
religion help you cope with life I feel
like for each one of these questions you
guys have asked me like my answer is my
religion and like my relationship with
God is basically what helps me overcome
anything helps me overcome leaving an
egg's helps me overcome like finding my
confidence it helps me
be more comfortable with myself like I
just feel like anything that I am
struggling with I can just like go to
God and like pray about and be like I'm
really struggling with this like I know
that God's reassurance really really
helps me every single day in my life and
that's why my relationship with him is
so important because it keeps me who I
am if I'm going through a breakup where
I'm going through a season of like
loneliness where I just don't like
hugging anybody and I'm just feeling
like really low I know that I am never
alone because I have God with me so like
that is how I cope with that if I'm
leaving like a toxic relationship around
leaving a friend behind that like used
to be really close with me but like now
they're just not in my life anymore I
know that like God is going to take care
of it and I just feel like with God
comes so much confidence and so much
security so I feel like every single one
of these questions that I'm answering
it's like like at the end of the day I
don't know how I deal with it because I
know that like my confidence and like my
strength comes from him so I just want
to help you guys after that because you
said how's your religion to help you
cope with life it helps me cope with
every single thing in my life and it
keeps me going because I know that I
have somebody that I'm doing life with
basically that is helping me for the
better
I'm getting a ton of questions on
rushing and I know it's like getting
closer to where you guys are probably
thinking what college is do you want to
go to and you're kind of trying to
figure out if you guys want to rush I
know I say this in almost every qat but
seriously it is so up 'full I made a
sorority recruitment video all about my
rush experience but it means to me how I
chose my sorority the outfits that I
wore to each day of recruitment all that
kind of stuff so I'll put that right
here - guys wanna go watch that I'm
getting a ton of questions about
sororities I absolutely love mine I'm
still obsessed with mine love being in
it but you guys are asking me so many
questions that I have answered a lot of
times before in my sparta video so if
you guys wanted to watch that I will put
that right there my friend hooked up
with my ex behind my back that got
really upset and I confronted her she
told me she really liked him after about
a week I gave her the green light to be
with him it still makes me feel really
uncomfortable but I don't want to lose a
friend over stupid boy can I trust her
or no this is a really hard one because
I am like assuming you guys are super
close she's your best friend and I just
feel like as close as you guys were
this is just me and like my personal
this is just what I believe as close as
I am to each and every single one of my
friends I would never in a million years
ever talk to their eggs like I don't
care if I'm like oh my god they're so
hot oh my gosh they're like flirting
with me they're into me and I'm into
that like I just would feel so
uncomfortable and honestly just like as
a friend my loyalty lies with my friend
and not like that guy that's giving me
attention for a minute because that is
still their ex-boyfriend so I mean I
feel like you guys probably still have a
good friendship and you guys could keep
it going and you could trust her I think
eventually it's going to be super
uncomfortable like when they're dating
and you're just like okay that's my
ex-boyfriend
but I feel like they'll probably be
together for a little bit and then break
up and you guys will be good friends
good because I'd be like oh my god he
sucks right we both dated him he's the
worst but I feel like you should
probably branch out find other friends
that are like super super and good for
you and you could still be friends with
her I'm just saying don't put all your
focus into her as your best friend
because she obviously has a very
different mindset if she is going out
with your ex that is all for the
questions for today I hope you guys like
this video I love doing advice videos I
just feel like it helps me feel more
connected to you guys I try to answer as
many as I could but honestly I got so
many questions like I don't even know
what to do if you guys like this video

out and your like everyday live stuff
