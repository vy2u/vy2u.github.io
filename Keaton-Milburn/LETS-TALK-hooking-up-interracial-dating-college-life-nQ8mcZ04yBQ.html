but you gotta be there for me too what's
up guys so today's video is going to be
another advice video I've entirely
leased the ax let's talk videos because
I just feel like I want to create a
series of this I want to do these a lot
more frequently so you guys ask me
questions anonymously on my tumblr and
I'm going to be giving you guys advice
or just answering questions that you
guys have for me that you guys are just
wondering so if this is your first time
to my channel subscribe if you guys like
it if you guys enjoy listening to me
ramble on and on and on don't forget to
subscribe and follow me on Instagram
Twitter cuz that is where I post the
most I post it on Twitter and Instagram
so you guys would have known I was doing
a Q&amp;amp;A if you guys follow me on both of
those so super helpful to follow me
without me rambling anymore let's get
into it also my phone cases from
Wallflower cases I will link it down
below if you guys want it I know I'm
gonna get questions about it so this one
says my boyfriend and I broke up we live
apart from each other because I moved to
study our relationship got strained
because of distance and we broke up two
weeks ago I have been relatively sad
about accepting the reason but still sad
while my best friend saw him out and
spoke to him you told her it was kind of
over at which surprised me he hasn't
contacted me to know he doesn't care
despite us being in love hurts am I
crazy how do I stop thinking about
someone you guys are always asking me
how do I get over a guy how do I stop
thinking about someone and it's really
really hard because I feel you guys and
I feel like a lot of times when I do
these type of videos you guys think like
I am telling you guys what to do because
I have it all figured out and I don't go
through this
I am currently trying not to think about
somebody and currently trying not to
help them on my mind all the time so I
do understand it's hard it's hard to go
if you're talking to someone every
single day to literally having no one to
talk to about it even if you do have
friends it's hard to talk to them
because it's just like they're not the
same person that you were always talking
to about like your problems and just
like day-to-day things I feel like the
best thing that you need to do is keep
yourself busy
I always find myself like sitting in my
room and like purposely making myself
sad like I'll watch sad movies or I'll
like listen to like sad music or
something like that but it's so good
just to keep yourself busy it is okay to
like go through like your side biz which
I am like totally for I will literally
go dry for like an hour and listen to
sad music just because it's like that's
like therapeutic for me it just makes me
feel better
oddly enough but stay busy
ever your friends are going like if
they're like oh we're gonna go the
grocery store like go to the grocery
store with them if they're like oh we're
gonna do this even if it's an activity
that you wouldn't normally do and you
don't like to do go do it even if it's
just like you like going shopping by
yourself or like going and like getting
your makeup done doing my makeup is like
super therapeutic for me I literally
don't think about anything except for
doing my makeup I normally watch like
really funny shows on Netflix
that's just like a way to take your mind
off of somebody that you're trying to
get over it's just like keeping yourself
busy is like the number one thing I can
recommend when like going through a
breakup or anything it's just like do
something every single day because like
if you don't you're just going to end up
thinking about it non-stop and you're
probably think about it few times to off
the date but it's just like it's going
to overwhelm you if you just sit and do
nothing but I feel like schoolwork takes
up a lot of my time and I just like go
out and do things I wouldn't normally do
when I'm trying like not to think about
someone did you get hazed what was the
process like once you got event your
sorority no I have never been hazed
ASU is like a no-tolerance no hazing
tolerance whatever and I have never ever
been hazed no one I know my sorority has
ever been hazed like we know like hazing
is not a thing I know a lot of people
get scared about that when they go into
sororities I was never hazed and none of
my friends even at other universities
like in Texas and Louisiana and stuff
like that like they weren't hey is that
honest and it really freaks me out that
you like would be hazed so if you guys
are worried about that and joining a
sorority don't be because that's really
not calming like Jax is not a thing I
wasn't hazed but once I got my bed to my
sorority I literally just like ran into
my chapter I ranch all my sisters and I
was like oh my gosh we're here we had
like little celebration like little
party after actually vlog good day it's
on my blog Channel if you guys are
interested in seeing what it's like in a
sorority and like seeing like what Big
Day is like well for me at ASU it's on
my vlog Channel so what to do when you
don't feel confident in your body and
how do you deal with friends who don't
make you feel confident so it's hard to
have friends who you feel like are
putting you down I have had friends in
my life who I just feel like look down
on me or just like think that I'm last
or like not as cute or like they're so
much better and it's really really bad
to place your confidence and your
friends and like
people around you because it's like
they're never gonna give you the
feedback that you want even if it's like
a guy and you've like been dating
someone for a really long time and they
don't they're never gonna give you the
right compliments or the right
confidence like you're never going to
fully feel like that because you have to
find confidence in yourself like who you
are like you can't face your confidence
and other people or you're just never
gonna be happy only if I'm feeling like
down myself but I'm just playing like
fat or like not cute I just have to like
to sit down and think I'm like Keith why
are you really upset right now like why
are you really feeling gross you
literally look the exact same as you did
two days ago you were happy two days ago
why today are you so upset it could be
that your period is coming honestly
that's when likes most the time when I'm
like oh my god I'm so ugly I'm fat
because my period is coming and I'm like
oh my god but if I'm ever feeling like
calms but I need to just sit down and
I'm like can you rethought you wait like
reevaluate your life why are you feeling
so low like you shouldn't be feeling
ugly or gross because you don't have
makeup on or you do have makeup on or
you're dressed up or you're not dressed
up like you should just be happy like
get over it was it hard to drop to a
college living so far away from home it
was really really hard my freshman year
was honestly super super hard for me
because you guys know if you guys watch
my blog Channel I am very very close to
my family I'm super family-oriented so
being so far away from my family and
struggling to make friends or struggling
to get involved here like really really
affected me and it made me like super
sad thankfully I purposely made myself
get involved I joined a sorority I went
to like every sorority event ever like I
literally went out of my way to be like
hey what are you guys doing like can I
come like I just had to invite myself
and people always say like in college
like there's so many other people so
equally you meet which there are so many
people in college but you have to make
an effort to make those friends like you
have to put an effort in I'm not that
type of person I know it seems like this
in videos but like in real life I'm not
that person to just like sit down Nexis
I'm gonna be like hi what's your name
like that's just not who I am I'm
literally dead silent if you ever meet
me so it was really really hard to adapt
to but you learn very very quickly if
you're not going to put yourself out
there you're not going to have a good
experience in college you're not gonna
make friends like if you don't do it no
one else is gonna do it for you so I
joined a gym I found a
like now I have all these friends that I
work out with and know how this girl's
my sorority and then I take sign
language I know like always people oh my
son in which class is like it's just
like you have to make an effort so it
was really hard to adapt to but it's my
sophomore year it's the end of my
sophomore year which is really scary but
I've gotten used to it and you just have
to put yourself out there if you guys
are going into college keep that in mind
it is super important for you to know
that you have to make an effort how do
you feel about sex before marriage I am
a Christian and devoted to God and I
feel guilty that I didn't wait I get a
lot of these questions because a lot of
people who only come to me and they're
like oh I'm a Christian I'm waiting till
marriage because I don't have sex like
is that weird you get made fun of and I
also get the questions of like I've
already had sex and I feel bad I just
want to say it doesn't make you a better
person because you haven't had sex and
it doesn't make you a better person
because you have does it make you less
of a person because you haven't had sex
and doesn't make you less of a person
because you have it it's not it's not
like that
yes I'm choosing to wait for marriage
and I want to wait for marriage and
that's a personal choice people's paths
are different some people have gone down
different paths and already had sex but
maybe they don't want to do that anymore
and that's okay because I know tons of
people who are great Christians and have
an amazing relationship with God and yes
they've had sex but it's just like any
other thing and I feel like a lot of
times people overlook that and they look
at sex is like not as much of a factor
as it is they're like oh well there's
lying and stealing and murderer and
things like that and people are like oh
my gosh all those are so bad but when it
comes to sex people kind of want to
overlook the fact that that's also not a
thing that you should be doing just
because that's like something that
people struggle is so bad it's like they
always want to just overlook there're a
lot of times people who have already had
sex or like well I've already done it so
why does it matter
you shouldn't feel guilty if you've
already had sex and you don't want to
anymore and you want to wait till
marriage that's your choice you can do
it there's no one stopping you from not
having sex you know it's up to you you
kind of have to have the willpower in
the faith just to say like I'm not going
to anymore like this is my decision and
it's also really important that you get
into a relationship with someone who
understands that even if they
I've had sex before and you've had sex
before they need to understand that
that's not going to happen I have tons
of friends who are like that they've had
sex before and then got into
relationship and both chosen not to have
sex the entire relationship and it still
worked perfectly fine it is possible and
I know it seems impossible but there is
somebody out there that is going to be
willing to do that because they will
love you enough to do that which I am
also trying to remind myself that there
is someone out there will love me enough
do not up sex until marriage you just
have to find the right person
I'm very antisocial around people and
just want to know if you knew any ways
to get out of being awkward around
people so I know this seems weird
because all I do is talk to a camera and
literally all I do is post by myself and
talk to you guys so it seems like I
wouldn't be that awkward in person but
if you know me and you know my friends
in situations where there are a lot of
people I have a hard time like making
conversation or keeping a conversation
going because I do feel so awkward and
because I have that anxiety aspect which
I know a lot of you guys are always
asking me questions about anxiety no I
don't have any medicine for my anxiety I
thought about it I was actually my
freshman year college because I was
struggling so much here in college
making friends and I didn't know how to
talk to people and my anxiety was like
at an all-time high literally couldn't
even like approach anyone I was having
so much anxiety I was gonna go to like a
counselor like a therapist and just like
get prescribe something cuz I was like I
like I need help so I fill you on being
antisocial and if there's any tip so
I've learned that it's just very
important to engage yourself in
conversation even if it's not something
you would technically like be that
interested in if I'm in a group of
people and like I don't feel like the
conversation is that interesting if
they're all talking about something I
find something that I know about the
topic and I'm just like oh how do you
feel about this me asking questions
makes it seem like I am more engaged in
the conversation it helps you build
relationships with people asking
questions would be like my number one
tip so it's like if someone's like oh I
really like painting it's like what do
you like to paint where do you like to
paint when did you start painting like
it's just conversation skills I know it
sounds like so basic if you guys don't
deal with like this type of like
antisocial thing group I still struggle
with things
but I totally understand you guys when
you're in a conversation it's super hard
I have had to work on this a ton
especially being a broadcasting and like
journalism major I am always going to
have to interview people ask people
questions and that's something that I've
had to learn it's just like I need to be
more engaged in conversation not
antisocial and awkward so really just
practicing when you're in a group of
people even if it's a friend it could be
your family whatever they're talking
about think of at least three questions
that you can add to the conversation and
ask them even if you can't ask all three
or two shy ask at least one of them and
it will help you get more like social
how to live a positive healthy life I've
been struggling lately with depression
I'm really looking for ways to be
happier and genuinely enjoying my life I
always look at being positive and being
happy and being like not depressed as
you choice like you have to decide like
I'm going to be happy and you have to
make an effort to do things that make
you happy because I know it's very very
easy when you're sad and you're just
already at a low point to just stay like
steadily declining and just being like
okay well whatever I'm already sad I
might as well just like stay sad but you
can't do that you have to push yourself
to like go out and like find things that
make you happy me music is very very
very therapeutic with me that's why I do
music of the months every month that's
why I make playlist all the time because
I am constantly listening to music and
listening to music literally like I'm
not kidding it literally like saves my
life I'm like that sounds so dramatic
but music is super therapeutic to me so
you just have to find something that
like you really really like to do I also
like to focus a lot on like school work
and if schoolwork is something that is
stressing you out then take a step back
and focus on what you need to get your
work done but make time for the things
that make you happy find that one friend
that will like go out to eat with you
like go get ice cream with you like one
day out of the week and that can really
like brighten your week up you just have
to choose to live a happier life and do
things that you know we're gonna make
you happy because it is really easy to
like consistently do things that are
just like whatever how do I stop
comparing myself to my boyfriend's eggs
I get tons of questions like this this
is really really hard and it's hard not
to look it's like if you like stop
talking this I want to make it with
someone else you're like oh my god like
but why would they want her like if you
think you're pretty or you think you
have more of this I just want to say
whoever it is that you're with or
whoever it is that you're talking to
whether they leave you to talk to
someone else or they talk to someone
else that may have been like prettier
looking the new that has nothing to do
with who you are as a person you can be
freaking like Alexis Wren and like get
cheated on and that has literally
nothing to do with the way she looks how
many followers she has what she does it
has everything to do with the person you
just might not be what's right for them
and you can't compare yourself to
someone else because you guys are never
going to be the same so your boyfriend's
ex is like someone that looks literally
nothing like you a completely different
personality and you might look up to
that person you're like oh my gosh why
is my boyfriend dating me now when like
he was saving her it it doesn't matter
he obviously likes you for you and you
need to be confident in your
relationship because if you're not and
you're always questioning it then
there's something off there because you
should go confident and you should feel
100% not worried about this ex like if
you're worried about someone else that
your boyfriend used to talk to like
there's already a problem there and I
know that sucks to hear but it's like if
you're at all like questioning your
relationship with somebody then there's
obviously something off I'm not saying
you guys are gonna break up I'm just
saying there needs to be like a
conversation like am i what you want and
are you what I want advice on dealing
with boys who don't want our
relationship only only watch a hookup
leave him there have been so many times
I have talked to so many different guys
and been like oh like maybe they wanted
a me maybe they're like not just
interested in like making out or like
hooking up or whatever and it's just
like if that's not their motive from the
beginning then that's not gonna be their
endgame they need to actually be looking
for a relationship to even be interested
you cannot change someone's mind you
cannot change who someone
is if you're talking to someone and
you're just like oh well like he says he
likes me but like he doesn't put me on
his snapchat sorry he doesn't tell his
friends he's talking to me he just says
I'm a friend like he's not that
interested in you he's not trying to
build a relationship with you you might
really like you he might love you but
he's not trying to be in relationship
with you and that's the bottom line you
should know someone's motive and
someone's intentions right from the
get-go if you guys are just talking
because if you let it escalate where you
are letting him just do whatever he
wants you just continue talking to him
it's just like you're giving him
everything that he wants but you're not
getting what you want out of it which is
a relationship so you really need to
check the person you're talking to his
motives before because if he just is not
looking for relationship at the moment
he's not going to be looking for one
three months down the road cuz that's
just not how it is I myself am very
attracted to block guys like you Keaton
however where I live and then people
around me find it not to be norman and
i'm looked at differently which is wack
any advice I love how you know this
about me this is a topic that really
really bothers me and I try not to talk
about it a lot on my channel because I
know other people have very very
different opinions but you liking
another race or another ethnicity or
whatever has nothing to do with you
liking other race or another ethnicity
it has everything to do with you liking
who that person is just because you find
one person in the way that they look
more attractive in the other doesn't it
there's there's no difference like it
literally bothers me so much the people
are like oh you like the same person
like why does it matter to you like why
does that bother you it's like like no
one says anything when it's the same
race but one it's two different races
it's like such a big deal all of a
sudden so I understand that that
probably bothers you and you feel like
you're looked at differently I have
never ever let what anyone ever says
affect me like that like I've never had
someone tell me like oh you like this
person well did you know that their this
ethnicity I'm like okay and like you're
like point you really just have to tune
out people's negative comments even if
it's your own family and your own best
friends it can be like the people in
your town you just really have to tune
those out and like know that you like
someone just because they are who they
are and it should
it matter who you like if they have a
problem with it if someone has a problem
with who you're dating that's their
problem
like sorry what do you want me to do
about it like how do you show an ex that
you're a bad witch and better off
without them like how do you get them to
crawl back just so you can show them
that you're over it I know that thumps
oh well well this is like such a mood
for like every girl like every girl goes
through that thing where they like stop
talking to someone and then they're like
you thought like I'm cute I'm the best
you're ever gonna get so let me just
show you that I don't care if you left
me the greatest satisfaction comes from
like succeeding in life and you doing
everything right like you literally not
caring about anything that they're doing
never talking about your ex never
mentioning them to friends never talking
down on them living your life and
pretending like that person just doesn't
exist not being rude to them but just
feeling indifferent to them it's going
to make them be like why does she
literally not care the second you stop
caring about somebody who has done you
wrong they're going to start caring
about what you're doing and you're going
to move on and be happy eventually and
not happiness is going to show they're
like you're just literally gonna glow up
on your own and you shouldn't do it from
like a spiteful place like oh my gosh
well like you wanted to do this so I'm
gonna do this like that's not how it
should be it should just be like I'm
better off without you no matter with or
without you like I'm going to do better
and once you stop caring about literally
anything that they have to say they're
gonna realize like oh my god wow she
really doesn't care and that's gonna
make you feel better not a spiteful way
not in a revengeful way you shouldn't
talk down on that person talking down on
an ex like that just hear me out ladies
men talking down on an ex is like a
number one no no because that is just
gonna make you look so terrible it's
gonna make you look like you care it's
gonna make you look like they affect you
and you don't want that like you just
don't like don't even subtweet them
don't sub snap them don't don't post
anything on your fence does like don't
do that because then it's just going to
show that you care even more because
you're posting about it even though it's
a sub it's like they know what it's for
so
just just move on with your life that's
all the questions I have for today I
love thumbing needs advice videos I just
feel like I'm talking to you guys I feel
so much more like connecting with you
