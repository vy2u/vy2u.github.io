but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be my let's talk video this is a new
series that I've started on this channel
I'm trying to do these every month I
hope you guys like this background I
tried to change it up and bring it in my
room so it wasn't just like a plain
white wall I don't know if you guys like
this if you guys do let me know in the
comments down below
I'll keep it like this I have like all
this yellow in here and it makes me
happy so I figured it would be cute in
today's video I'm going to be talking in
today's video I'm going to be talking
about social media because this is a
topic I really wanted to talk about a
lot and I tweeted about me quitting
social media or taking a break from
social media a while ago and you guys
are like I would actually really like to
hear your experience on that and I have
kind of wanted to tell you guys my
experience on it so I'm first gonna tell
you guys why I quit using social media
for a while and what it was like why I
liked it why I didn't like it that will
answer majority of the questions for
this video but the ones that it doesn't
answer I'm gonna go through the ones on
my tumblr that you guys asked me because
you guys asked me a ton on my tumblr if
this is your first time to my channel
your first time seeing this lovely face
of mine don't forget to subscribe it
would mean so much to me I love how you
guys and my family don't forget to
follow me on Instagram and Twitter
because that is where I stay most up to
date with you guys you guys see me like
once a week on here but you guys can see
me every single day on the other social
media so I love on this videos about
social media and me quitting it but I'm
like follow me but like you guys get the
point anyway so back in December I had
an experience prior to December of 2017
two months before I would say I had
really really really been thinking I
really want to take a break from social
media I really hate how much I use
social media it seriously consumes my
life and it did consume my life like I
was literally always on my phone and
every single person I was ever with like
my family my friends like anyone I have
gotten in trouble in school since sixth
grade I got my phone taken up like four
times in sixth grade because I could not
stop being on I have always been
addicted to my phone I have always just
never stopped using it for some reason
and I realized in 2017 that I was just
on social media way way way way way too
much and not only was I on social media
too much but I was too consumed with the
thought of what I looked like on social
media and how people were perceiving me
on social media and not to say I was
trying to look like somebody I wasn't
because that wasn't really the case it
was more like I was posting things on
social media for a reaction from a
specific person like I wanted this
specific person to see that picture or
like if there was someone that I liked
and they didn't like my Instagram
picture or they didn't view my snapchats
where they didn't do this like I was so
offended and I was like so upset by it
and I realized like why does it matter
like why am I getting so upset by
someone not viewing my instagrams or
like is that like legit what I'm mad
about right now like really so in
December I had something where I got
really really really sad and you guys
know because I posted on my blog channel
and I went through that's a loud truck I
went through kind of a phase where I was
really really upset about something and
I don't wanna go to detail of it because
I mean I'm already past it and I don't
really want to go back to that place but
I was really really upset by something
and someone and I was just like I can't
be on social media anymore like I don't
even want to look at this person anymore
I don't want to see a single thing they
have to post like it was like hurting me
so bad to the point where I just didn't
want social media anymore like I didn't
want any of it so I deleted my social
media January 1st
I believe I deleted my social media
because it was after New Year's I
deleted my social media I deleted my
Twitter my Instagram and my snapchat all
off of my phone because I didn't want it
anymore actually now that I think about
it January 1st because I was so upset on
January 1st I turned my phone off for
the entire day and I just left it and
literally didn't use it because I was
just so upset and I was so sick of
looking at social media
fast-forward obviously as you guys know
you're like why did you quit social
media which I did for three two
for months I wasn't on social media and
you guys are like wait how is that
possible you were posting all the time I
had my mom actually posting on my
Instagram stories my Instagram and my
Twitter for me she posted everything for
me
so that I wouldn't have to do it myself
so I didn't get tempted to get back on
it but obviously social media is my job
this is something that I'm passionate
about when I do love social media it's
just I was not in the right mind state
to be on it because I was getting so
affected by it and that's not on anyone
else everyone uses social media me being
so upset by seeing things on social
media or seeing girls that are traveling
to all these amazing places and buying
all these really expensive things and
like me being sad about that has nothing
to do with what they're doing it just
has to do with me not being able to like
take that like I was just too
weak-minded honestly to be on social
media and it was really really tearing
down my character and once I realized
that I was like I don't need to be also
shedding more on social media anymore if
that's what it's gonna do so my mom ran
my social media for about three months
she posted all my stuff I was still
going out obviously and living my life
and I was like go take mzm pictures and
then I would literally just send the
caption and send the picture my mom be
like can you post this but it was super
beneficial for me because I couldn't see
who was like you my picture I couldn't
see who is viewing extorts I couldn't
see people's comments on it I didn't
have any relative idea of who cared and
who did it and that really helped me
because that's what I was so consumed by
in the first place like if there was
someone that I thought was like slightly
cute or if I had like a friend who I
thought we were good friends but like
they didn't like my insert picture I was
like so are we not good friends anymore
and that's just like such a crazy
thought to have like really because they
didn't like your instrument sure like
what an ounce a day and age that we live
in and it's like it is important if
someone is your best friend and they're
not liking your screen pictures like
obviously they've kind of really don't
care about you but at some point it gets
to a point where it's like it's really
it's not that important like it's not
that relevant you like move on girl
so after
about three months I felt really good
about it and I felt like I wanted to be
bad I felt like I was ready to be back I
got back on Twitter
first not Instagram and serum was when I
stayed off of the longest Instagram in
snapchat or when I stayed off of the
longest Twitter I got back on first
because Twitter didn't really affect me
in that way and that's a really easy way
for me to communicate with you guys it's
funny because I was like oh they won't
know I'm still tweeting the links to my
YouTube videos so they won't really know
I'm not on Twitter and you guys were
tweeting me all the time like oh my gosh
I miss you where have you been but like
I was still on Twitter but like it
wasn't really me on Twitter so you guys
basically know me way too well and you
guys knew that I was like so in my a off
of Twitter so I got back especially
because but I found out that Kylie
really really was pregnant and then she
posted her pregnancy video I was like
okay wait guys I need Twitter back
because I need to see
Kylie's baby so thank you kind of Jenner
you brought them back to social media
but I got in a much healthier mind State
and I really feel like it changed me for
the better and that sounds so crazy
because I just didn't have social media
for three months but I used to
legitimately not be able to go a single
place without my phone like I had to
have something playing at all the times
on my phone I had to always be
refreshing my phone I checked it
non-stop like guys I was so obsessed
with having like communication with
people and seeing how many likes I got
how many followers I was getting and
that's just it's so gross if you guys
find yourself getting so obsessed with
social media and so obsessed with what
everyone else is doing it's not even
like feeling insecure about the way you
look compared to someone else it can
literally be something as simple as like
oh my god this person went to New York
for the weekend like I wish I could go
to New York for the weekend and you
start to feel bad about yourself it's
like take a step back and like look at
your life and look at what you're
currently doing in the present and stop
worrying so much about what every other
influencer what all these people are
doing on social media because look at me
and you guys thought for 3-4 months I
was like having the best time ever and
doing all this amazing stuff when really
I wasn't even on social media and it
wasn't even me
and that just goes to show that it
doesn't matter what it looks like on
social media what someone's doing they
could be going through so much stuff and
you have no idea and that's really
really important to remember because I
was going through a lot and I still go
through a lot and I still post on social
media the happiest I can be and on
YouTube I feel like this is a super good
outlet for me to just like talk to you
guys and share what I really really have
to say like I'm literally just sitting
in my bed talking to you guys and this
is like an authentic me but Instagram
and Twitter and stuff like that I feel
like you don't post videos of you crying
and you don't post I don't know you just
don't post the negative things like that
on Instagram which is fine but you need
to know as a subscriber as a viewer as a
follower as a friend like that is not
realistic yes I'm having fun and I'm
posting pictures of me having fun things
but just know that that might be that
moment ten minutes after the pictures
taken I might be upset about something
so it's just like you guys never really
know and I just wanted to share that
because if you guys are struggling with
social media and you struggle finding
your confidence and other people and
seeing what everyone else is doing and
getting down on yourself just know
everyone has their faults no one is
perfect everyone is going through
something and if it helps take a break
like don't use social media then like I
literally loved having no social media
so much that like I think about it every
day and I'm like why did I get it back
like not in a bad way but sometimes I
find myself getting back in that place
of like oh my gosh why did they look at
it or like oh that this picture do well
did it perform well and I'm like don't
be worried about that like worry about
yourself and your life and what you're
doing instead of how your picture is
doing so if you guys are struggling with
that I totally recommend taking a break
I find myself all the time leaving my
phone tons of places and just not even
bringing it with me anywhere because it
feels so good to just be where I'm at in
life instead of through my camera lens
all the time I just wanted to share that
because I feel like it's super important
for you guys to know that and it's so
annoying that social media and flu
SURS sit on social media and talk about
how they hate social media and how they
want to take a break and how social
media is fake but we're sitting on
social media and we're saying that and
then we continue to use it and that's
true as much as social media can't
change your perspective and it can
sometimes make you feel low or make you
look at other people in which you were
doing what they were doing that is on
you and it's not on social media you
feeling low about yourself because you
see what someone else is doing is an
insecurity on your part and that's the
honest truth and that was kind of hard
for me to face it's like you look at
what everyone else is doing you're like
oh my god they're so pretty I had to
unfollow them because like I'm so
annoyed it's like that's a you problem
that is not of them problem they're
living their life and they're posting
whatever whether they're fake or they're
real or not that's that's them and you
feeling insecure about it can only be on
you just to emphasize that a little bit
more I absolutely absolutely loved my
break on social media I loved not being
on it for like three months like that's
quite a long time for someone to use the
social media so much and it felt so good
and it still feels so good because now I
do not feel as attached to my phone
going so long without it it's like I
know now that like it's not that
critical for me to have it at all times
like I used to be like no no but like
what if someone calls me and it's like
okay well you can call them back in a
few hours when you get your phone back
like now I'm just so less obsessed with
it and it feels so good to be able to
actually just go to dinner or go to
lunch or take a shower like I used to
legit have my phone in the shower with
me like texting people or on Twitter and
it's like girl go with ten minutes
without it like maybe you guys shouldn't
delete all your social media apps you
right away if that's what you're wanting
to do maybe start slowly and do it like
literally go on a drive and leave your
phone at home or something or go to
dinner with a friend go to lunch with a
friend go to brunch or something and
just leave your phone off for the whole
brunch and see how it makes you feel and
see how much more present you are and
your life
and I never ever ever thought I would be
a person preaching this because I would
never not have my phone anywhere I would
always always always have it but now
that I took a break I fully understand
why parents and old people always say oh
my gosh get off your phone and I'm like
yeah because you guys have been
experiencing all of this and I've been
on Twitter for three hours I think
looking at memes so I'm like it feels
just so good to not be so obsessed and
so consumed with how I think others are
perceiving me how I want to be perceived
and things like that and I want to share
that with you guys because you guys are
always commenting and I see you guys
tagging people münster in pictures I
mean like oh my god can you imagine
being this perfect oh my god look
imagine being her I'm like imagine being
you like think it is flattering but I'm
like you guys I'm so normal and so
regular and my Instagram is legit the
best parts of my life my wife put into
one Instagram picture with seven
different filters over it and some face
tune to get my pimples out and you guys
are like oh my god imagine being this
perfect and I'm like come on we need to
be on the same page here we cannot want
to be someone else we need to want to be
just ourselves so now into you guys
questions that you guys asked me on
Twitter I wanted to keep this very
focused on social media obviously so I'm
going to be answering the social media
questions from this so this one says has
body images from social media ever gone
- I find myself Sundays I'm feeling
confident about myself until I scroll
through Instagram and I end up feeling
bad do you have any tips on how to get
through that believe it or not like the
most perfect people in the world still
get like this on days that you think
that they could never when you see
someone like when I see a Lexus friend
I'm like there's nothing that you you
can't be mad at anything you can't be
mad at anyone in the world no one your
stomach is a legit like flatter than
like but like the walls in a room like
she is like inverted like she is so tiny
and I'm like there's no way you could be
mad about anything and it's like when I
get thinking about that I'm like
everyone has insecurities everyone looks
in the mirror and has something that
they don't like about them
selves whether you feel like you look
the best whether you feel like you look
like Alexis won or not which I don't
ever feel like I look like Alexis man or
not but I'm not going to be less
confident in myself because I don't look
like someone else I'm never going to
look like someone else I just have to be
confident in the way that God made me
and the way I looked and if I want to
change something about myself if I want
to work out or if I want to get skinny
then do it like no one to stop and you
except for you and that's something that
I get a lot of questions about
definitely is working out and like
feeling confident that way and it's like
it took me so so so long to actually
start working out and getting a trainer
and it wasn't anyone else's fault except
for mine so if there is something that
you want to change about yourself or
something that makes you not feel as
confident then change it for yourself
like do that but I strongly strongly
believe that the start of your
confidence comes from who you are as a
person and you just believing in
yourself as opposed to your outward
appearance I have always been into
social media and building my media
presence but I just haven't known where
or how to start your Instagram is one of
my favorites and I love the space you
create for yourself on social media so
what would be your advice for someone
else to grow build an Instagram /youtube
its appearance appearance presence I've
always said this but initially I
obviously wasn't trying to grow my
followers as much like yes I was posting
and I like wanted to gain followers but
it wasn't something I was super super
consumed by I think the number one thing
and this is for me personally everyone
that I follow on Instagram to me certain
celebrities and certain influencers I
follow them on Instagram or I subscribe
to them on YouTube because I feel an
authentic connection with them and I can
relate to them on some level whether it
be their makeup that they do whether it
be like their lifestyle whether it be
college people it's just like I can
relate to them on some level so in order
to grow your Instagram or your YouTube
presence you have to be your most
authentic self and share things that
make you you open up on social media
people who open up on social media are
some of the biggest influencers like
people who let you genuinely like into
their life and tell you their deepest
and darkest secrets like those people
are who I can relate with and who I
actually feel like we haven't connect
because they've told me everything and I
think that's my number one thing on
social media be genuine to yourself your
shelf to yourself share things about
yourself that you want other people to
know
don't treat social media like you're
trying to gain a bunch of followers you
treat it like you're trying to gain a
bunch of friends which is what you're
trying to do like their social media is
so amazing and it's such a great
community of people who all have such
similar interests and love the beauty
community or love I mean there's so many
different aspects to social media and
it's like it's not just for followers to
follow each other and like just gain
like millions and millions it's like I
genuinely create relationships with you
guys and I feel like you guys are my
friends so if you guys are trying to
grow your presence or grow your
Instagram do it in a way that you're
looking for friends and not followers so
that's not the social media questions
I'm gonna answer for today I really just
want to sit down and talk to you guys
because this was something that I really
wanted to share on how it changed me
because really quitting social media
really really really did change me so
hard to explain but I wanted to share it
with you guys because I know a lot of
people struggle with this and I am just
like you guys even they don't think it
even though you guys watch mine YouTube
and you think I have my whole life put
together like trust me I was crying like
4 hours ago so like don't worry about it
we all go through things sometimes we
need a little bit of a break a little
bit of a pick-me-up but if you guys do
don't worry because I'm always here I
love when you guys tweet me and I love
when you guys message me for advice and
stuff like that these are my favorite
videos to film on this channel because I
genuinely feel so connected to you guys
and I loved were you guys comments so
