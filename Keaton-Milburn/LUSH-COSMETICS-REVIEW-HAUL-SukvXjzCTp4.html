going to be a lush review and haul if
you don't know what lush is it's pretty
much just a store that has skin products
lip products hair products all that kind
of stuff but it's vegetarian and none of
it is tested on animals I have been
wanting to check out lush for a long
long time like probably like a year like
it's probably been a year since I've
learned to get something actually from
there well we just had a lush opened up
in our mall so I decided why not just go
in there and get some before I start
this video I also want to say I did not
post last Friday because I was at summer
camp so I didn't really have my camera
with me and I couldn't post but I have a
lot of video ideas for the next few
months like I have a ton I want to share
with you guys so stay tuned for those so
the first thing when we talk to new guys
or not is superbomb it is a scalp
treatment you might not need this but
with me I have a really dry scalp like
even like my skin my skin is just
overall really really dry so I need to
go the extra mile to moisturize it and
this just really helps if you have like
dandruff or just a dry scalp it's just
itchy all the time pretty much it's just
this green like really sticky paste
looking stuff and you just take it and
put a little bit on your scalp and you
leave it in there for 20 minutes and
then when you're done you just rinse it
out and you can do that every day or
before you shower I like to do it before
I shower so after I rinse that out in
the shower I use this lush Godiva's
shampoo bar so I have never used like a
shampoo that wasn't liquid like I just
think it's really weird that it's a
solid but let me take it out of this if
I could get it out it's like wet so it
like
okay so pretty much I have never
actually used a shampoo bar I didn't
really understand how it worked
it's literally shampoo just in this
thing also I haven't kind of feeling
really sick right now so if I'm sitting
and I so my command I'm sorry this bar
has Jasmine in it so when you put it in
your hair it just smells really really
good
Oh Sachi butter so it makes your hair
look really really soft basically the
way to use this is when you're in the
shower and your hair is wet you just use
it like regular shampoo just rub it all
on your head you just grow up the whole
bar all over your head I didn't think
that this would work I just thought it
was one of those like weird little
products that like look cool but they
don't really work very well but this
actually lathered up in my hair like
amazingly well I just felt like regular
shampoo the only difference is it's just
in this little bar so this one I
definitely recommend though it's awesome
and it works really well so the next
products I'm gonna share with you guys
is this big solid conditioner bar that's
a literally the name of it big solid
conditioner and and the stores they have
them just it's a huge huge slab of
conditioner and you just say like I want
ten dollars worth I want five dollars I
went twenty dollars worth they just cut
off a chunk for you and then they weigh
it and then they see how much is pretty
much and this is really like it just
feels like clay if you can see it's like
a mushy like I can leave a bend it like
a little no no it's super weird it's
really mushy because it has coconut oil
in it so it's solve into your hair
really well it also has like vanilla and
jasmine so it makes your hair but really
well basically it's just conditioner and
the first time I used it I'm not really
really dumb and I had no idea how to use
this and so I did the same thing I know
the shampoo does it okay just you rub it
into your hair didn't work at all and I
got really frustrated with it and just
chunks of it started coming off in my
hair and I was like this is the
stupidest product I've ever found
so I looked up how to use the big solid
conditioner on Lush Cosmetics YouTube
they actually have a
YouTube where they show how to use other
products because going into watching
movie super overwhelming and you don't
know how to use any other products and
it's just I don't know it's just really
weird so I look this up and there's also
a lot of different ways you can use this
but basically the main way is to pinch
off a chunk of it and rub it in your
palm with warm water from the shower you
just rub it in your palm for a while and
then it just turns to a regular
conditioner base and then you put that
in your hair and it works pretty well
the next thing moving on from all my
hair products this is a mint juleps lip
scrub and basically I saw this a long
time ago on one of Lohan that his videos
he had the there's a three different
flavors he had the bubble gum flavor but
I really like the mint one when I went
to the store I just dab my finger in it
really lightly I don't get too much
because if you get a lot I don't know I
just feel like that's way too much this
will last you a long time I promise but
I just get a little bit and I use it
like about every day pretty much just
because it's really fun to use and stuff
so I put on my lips and I rub my lips
together and it just exfoliates them if
you have more of chapped lips all the
time which I do so I really like this
product and the cool thing about it is
when you're done and you put all of your
lips you can just lick it off and it
tastes really good and so that may be
the only reason why like the last
product is this a love lettuce fresh
face mask and it is actually I'll show
you guys so it looks like this and it
just comes in this like little cute
container and you keep it refrigerated
because it is actually like fresh
products like it has literally like
lettuce in it and it has almonds in it
and because I love exfoliating it's like
my favorite thing to do like any face
wash that has exfoliating stuff in it I
will always pick that over a regular one
just because I love the way it feels so
this has crushed almonds in it for
exfoliating your skin
the only dead stuff come off that's
gross but whatever it has live into oil
and seaweed in it I don't know exactly
what those do but it's for like soothing
your face and stuff like that so that's
pretty cool basically you just put this
all over your face rub it in and you
look like a little green monster and you
leave it on for about ten minutes and
then you just rinse your face and it
feels awesome because when you keep it
refrigerated it's really cold so putting
it on your face it's just like it just
feels great so that is all for my lust
