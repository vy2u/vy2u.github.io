know that today the tragic even occurred
my nail came off my real nail it broke
in half and that literally came off and
it's bleeding and I just put this
bandaid on it was the most painful thing
if you guys get acrylic nails you know
this also this nail came off I'm having
a rough week I have a pimple on my lip
that is the size of Saturn I'm not even
kidding with you guys I have a doctor's
appointment right after comas feel
because something is wrong with my
tonsils I just did a full face of makeup
and then when I got on camera was so
obvious so I took all my makeup off and
put it right back on my face um we're
not so strong with me I think that's it
for now but we'll figure out some more
problems that are wrong with me when we
get into the rest of the video what's up
guys
today's video is going to be my summer
travel makeup essentials I'm not sure of
Pylos video but it's basically the
makeup that I love traveling with and
the makeup that is easiest for me to
travel with so yeah I just figured I
would show you guys this because I just
got back from a trip and it got a really
cute like makeup bag that I can use and
I actually filmed this video before I
went on the trip and then I got another
makeup back I was like who I want to
sell it with dis nigga bag but basically
these are things that no matter like
where I'm going if it's just like a four
day trip or something like this is the
makeup that I am most likely going to
bring because obviously I don't want to
bring a ton of makeup I want it to be
easy for me to travel so yeah also
really quickly before I get into this
video thank you guys so much for 100k
followers on Instagram that means so
much these I have no idea I was actually
doing an Instagram live comment down
below if you guys are watching my stream
life but I actually hit a hundred
thousand when I was on Instagram life
with you guys so there's no better way
than to celebrate meeting 100 kids and
being like on Instagram live always
activate oh my gosh you hated you in it
so it was really really exciting and
then you guys so much for magic 8-ball
if you guys aren't following me on
Instagram definitely go do that I've
been posting pictures from beautycon and
traveling all that stuff I post a lot of
things on my Instagram so yeah anyway
let's get into the video so this is the
makeup bag that I'm using it is
obviously pretty big
what I used in the video before I got
this back was actually a smaller mixed
bag and it was like really really easy
to pack into my bag but I just love this
bag so so much and I actually got this
from our PR which they work with like
Neutrogena and everything and I was so
so happy when I got this I went to lunch
with them and they gave this to me and I
was so excited so thank you if you guys
are watching this video I actually like
it looks those with respect so when you
open it up I didn't know what it was but
it's a Henry Bendel bath so yeah anyway
when you open it up looks like this has
a little mirror this little pouch also
has all this stuff in here
I'm going to show you guys the makeup in
like order of how I put them on my face
as I mix them to like primary foundation
concealer blah blah blah you guys get
the point the first thing that I always
like to pack is a is the glam glow glow
starters it's just a like moisturizer
kind of and depending on whatever shade
it in with the time I have three shades
of these I have like the lightest and
the medium and the darkest I just have a
chance so I am using the darkest shade
right now which is in the shade sighs
well that's just the moisturizer and
then I like to pack two other primers
this is the makeup forever step one
hydrating primer and then I like to pack
the smoothing primer just really my
forehead like my t-zone kind of area so
those are the primers I like to pack
along with the moisturizer which is kind
of like a primer for foundation
traveling I always like to pack a light
foundation in a dark foundation so I
packed the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation and these are obviously two
very very different shades I normally
will mix them together for my skin but
if I bring a really dark foundation and
then I'm like oh my gosh this is way too
dark I always have this makeup for
everyone in the shade
why two four five and this one is in the
shade why four to five so I have both of
these I will link all the makeup I'm
showing guys down below but I always
pack a lighter foundation just in case
and I normally have a spray on by the
end of my trip is kind of washed off so
it's faded and I also just got this
foundation which I actually love this is
a covergirl healthy elixir this also has
SPF 20 in it and
initiate creamy natural and I'm wearing
this today because this is like a middle
shade of these two but I just normally
like to pack a lot of foundation because
my skin color changes when I'm traveling
and if you're going somewhere tropical
you're going to want like different
bronzers and things like that so getting
into that I only packed one concealer
and that is the naked skin urban decay
concealer this is in the shade fair this
is just like a universal I don't know
concealer that I always always go to
doesn't mean I like to have when I'm
traveling is just like a setting powder
that is like my skin tone so this is the
Maybelline better skin in the shade
natural beige and has a little mirror in
it I lost the pouch that light comes
with it on this side but just a really
pretty natural shade and I like to set
my whole entire face with this up if I
don't feel like fake games or something
like that it's just good to have a
setting powder with you at all times I
normally have this like in my purse or
anywhere I'm going just in case I get
oily I set my face with this for
bronzers I pack 2 so the first one I
pack is the Impe 'innama sun shade by
Becca this is a really really dark
bronzer and this is for when I just get
a spray tan like look how dark that is
I'm not even wearing this today because
it's way too dark for me it's like when
I have a press spray but I normally will
bring a really dark bronzer just in case
and then I will bring oh gosh and then I
will bring a lighter bronzer this is the
Too Faced bronzer I wore this today
and this is the chocolate Soleil bronzer
and medium deep so I love the shade
place both of my bronzers no matter what
shade I am no matter what color and any
time I always always always have my
Smashbox what is this called you baked
starburst and this is like an
illuminating not illuminating but it
just has shimmer in it and you guys I
don't you guys can talk like hit pan on
it already and I just got it but I mixed
it in with my bronzer and just because
me a really really pretty glow to my
face
I forgot to show this but in case I want
to go one with like a deeper contour
that's like kind of cream I bring my
L'Oreal Lumi cushion and the shade c8
this band-aid is so unattractive it's
not even
cute I'm so sorry this is a super super
dark shade and I normally would use that
to contracted a disease any of my other
makeup tutorials I'll always use this to
contour when I'm really dark and I want
to go with like a full cream contour
that day to set all of that or to like
bake my face I always travel with my
Laura Mercier translucent powder this is
just universal go-to I will always have
this like Holy Grail makeup rise right
here so always travel with translucent
powder for black I'm not a great blush
girls I don't talk about to only type
one this is the Too Faced peach one in
the shade it's or even like more shades
it just says peach infuse blush I don't
see the shade number but it's really
really pretty and smells good so so I'm
a pack 3 like big palettes kind of self
to go along with contouring I always
bring my Kat Von D shade + light this is
like been through a guy's like this is
the wreck I'm missing an entire one
right here just want to hit pan at the
top so normally I just use these two
shades to contour with I never use the
want the top one I always use that one
and this is so old like she's already
changed the packaging on this I just
have this from like forever ago so
always always bring that I don't think a
lot of eyeshadow palettes just because
it's like I don't really do that much as
my eyeshadow and I feel like bringing
this eyeshadow palette this is the
chocolate bar palette by Too Faced it
like can do any type of look and I was
like a gold in there how the dirt like a
purple a pink of a room like I feel like
if I just travel with it for like a few
days I'll be fine
I don't normally bring a lot of makeup
palettes so this one is really really
good
next I always bring a highlighter I
always try not to pack a lot of
highlighters which I used to pack like
seven like a little like Becca
highlighter I used to pack so many but
now I'm traveling with just the
anastacio by the cool Guerrero glow
palette and I actually love this and
it's like traveling with the bunch of
highlighters but just in one palette
currently I use glow Gator and one for
three and I always ask for her lid on
top of it if I was going for a really
really glowy look I will always add
Forever Young in with my blush because
it's a really pretty pink so
I just feel like this palette in general
does a lot for my faves it's also really
good eye shadow like highlighting and
everything so always bring that
something also it's really important for
me to travel with which I don't use
every day is lashes so I always travel
with the are gel wispy lashes this is
just like a bunch of them just now when
I got back from New York when I went to
beauty con I had these with me and like
I actually love them like they're just
so easy to go on so I always bring lash
glue this is the duo lash curler I
believe and then our Delta T's for brows
I always travel with two specific brow
products this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow pencil and the shade soft
brown and then I travel with the Anasazi
of clear brow gel that's all I do is my
brows it's really really simple and
really easy which is why they look a
little ratchet but we're going to spray
a little that I bring this to eyeliners
with me and I am NOT like a liquid liner
kind of gal I'm just like a stick
eyeliner so I use the Urban Decay glide
on eye pencil and whisky this is a brown
so if I'm going for a very neutral like
everyday look I will always use a brown
liner if I'm going for a smokier look I
will always use a black eyeliner so this
is the Maybelline precise skinny on the
travel with one mascara and that's
because it's like the og mascara this is
the better than sex to face mascara this
does amazing things to my lashes I swear
of my life I could not live a day
without that mascara and I was just got
on it like a month ago so to set my face
I always bring a setting spray up so
many but my current day right now is the
Tarte rain ports of the sea it is just
in a little bottle like this and I love
this because it smells like the ocean
it's so crazy it smells like like lime
and like the like sea salt I don't even
know how to describe it but it smells
okay which is like the main reason I
love it right now so for lip products
that best think I would say to do is to
like pack as many lip products well I am
such like a hoarder with lipstick so I
always packed like a ton of news so
that's basically what I did so I have
this little baggage I got this from like
a different Beauty Congress
thing but always separate my lipsticks
and scoop I don't like throwing them in
my bag the two lip liners I've been
traveling with the most it's obviously
at max spice lip liner I bring this
everywhere I will never go day without
wearing set by smacks lip liner even if
I'm like doing a different table but
I'll always act by someone I don't know
why and then this is the makeup forever
lip pencil and number 12 I believe you
don't have names always only have
numbers so this is like and more like
pq1 in case I'm doing a pink look and
then I bring like three new chips so the
first one is this makeup forever as a
shade 103 this is just a really pretty
nude and this is a lighter pink new so
this is like deep you can see can't
function and then this is what I've been
obsessed with guys like I'm wearing it
on my lips today I'm wearing Mac lip
liner and I'm wearing this on top of it
and this is the event hot walker by
Maybelline and this is in the shade 64
unreal it's so glassy and it stays on
all day and it's so pigmented and so
I've been traveling with these three
news because I'm obsessed with them and
I need them every day in my life
okay so because I'm an extra and I just
like don't like being not prepared I
always pack red lipstick there's always
a good time when I'm traveling I'm like
I wish I'd like a red lip or something
like and I'm wearing a basic outfit so
this is the Kylie red lipstick in the
shade marriage okay this is a liner and
a lipstick I travel with both of these
all the time I even have these like in
my purse because for some reason I
always think that like one of these days
I'm going to randomly want red lips and
I'm not going to have a red lipstick
okay so these next two things are really
really good for traveling with like your
makeup brushes like the utensils you use
on your face so the first thing is from
NYX and it is this and a half a bunch of
these everywhere not just NYX has them
but they do have these a lot of
different places and basically it just
has a little clip and you pop it open
and when you open it up all my makeup
verses are in here and so what I like
shoes like when I go to a hotel or
wherever I'm staying I like to leave all
my face brushes in one of the containers
and then move all my eyeshadow brushes
and this container and then I like set
them on the counter and it's like I'm
like at home and like they're in my
little jar so I love love love traveling
with this and then it's so easy because
like when you're done
just puts a little lid on their and then
you clip it and it goes in your bag so
easily it's just I don't know it's just
really cute and I feel like everyone
needs these because I used to just throw
all my makeup brushes into like a little
bag and like they would just all make
the bag look like Brown like they were
just ruin everything because there was
so much makeup on them so it's really
really good to travel with Jessie's
makeup brushes this is also something I
highly recommend if you guys love your
Beauty Blender and you guys travel with
it they actually sell these for your
Beauty Blender it is a beauty blender
case it also has a keychain on it do you
go and clip it to your bag or something
but this is perfect because I used to
travel with my Beauty Blender in like a
napkin or something because if you guys
know if you travel with a Beauty Blender
and it's wet and you're throwing your
back it's going to mold so if you guys
use this it actually like ventilated
like hips just like a net kind of and I
just pop my Beauty Blender in here and
then it's good to go so I highly
recommend this it's amazing for
traveling I like changed my life anyway
