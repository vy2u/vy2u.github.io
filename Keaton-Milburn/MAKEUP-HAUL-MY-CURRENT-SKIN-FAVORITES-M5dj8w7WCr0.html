today's video is going to be a makeup
haul slash kind of review of things that
I am liking right now so this is a bunch
of stuff that I have recently it
purchased or God or whatever that I love
and I'm not just been using it a lot and
I was like you know what I haven't had a
makeup haul in a long time let's show
you guys some stuff I love um
just a disclaimer I am not sponsored in
this video at all every single product
in this video was I love it I genuinely
use it no one paid me to mention any of
this yes
some things may have been sent to me or
stuff like that but I've never been told
to talk about them on social media or
put them in this video
I genuinely love it and use it and that
is why I'm making this video so yeah um
let's just get into it so the first
things I'm going to show you guys are my
face products I mean everything
everything is gonna be a face product
but like my foundation stuff so the
first thing is this Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation and I used in one of
my tutorials and this is I don't even
know what shade this is I don't know how
to read anything but yeah this is the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation and
I love this I use it like every single
day and I haven't had a spray tan for
like a month and so this shade has I'm
working really really good for what I
like I don't have a fresh right hand but
I don't have like no spray tan so it's
like just and the middle so it's like
kind of pales I know really been digging
it and then the other things are also
from makeup forever and this one is
these are primers so you guys know like
are maybe may not he you know no no I
don't ever talk about this I don't use a
lot of primers I'm like every once in a
while like up around the primer but I'm
just like okay I don't really know the
difference but these are actually really
really loved so the first one this is a
smoothing primer and this is supposed to
help with your pores I've been wearing
this for like the past three days and
I've just been like focusing it more and
like when T's gone or whatever it's
getting so for dry skin I use the
hydrating primer and the nourishing
primer so I will I kind of switch it out
between these depending on like what I'm
feeling but these both help with dry
skin before you put your makeup on there
really good primers for that not
specifically I don't know if they really
make my makeup stay on that much longer
but yeah I like them for like a
moisturizer kinda and the next thing as
you guys know obviously have a lot of
Clinique products but I'm only going to
be talking about two so the first one is
the line smoothing concealer and this I
have been using a ton and replace of my
Maybelline age rewind I don't really
know why I like just I just keep going
back to this I think because when I
apply it under my eyes the brush is a
lot more like pointed like you know that
the Maybelline like age rewind one is
like around spongy things which is kind
of like you place it this I can be like
specific and like contour my nose I'm
like I don't put in certain places so I
really liked the applicator I guess of
this and then I don't know I just really
like the color and it kind of looks like
I'm naked on camera I swear I'm wearing
a tank top thing okay whatever umm so I
love this and then the other thing from
Clinique is this bronzer and this is in
the shade Sun blushed and I don't know I
just really like the shade it's super
pretty like a dark it's almost has like
hint of red to it I don't know it's like
a red Brown looks kind of like I don't
know just really goes good with my skin
tone and I like it
bronzing so this is actually something I
repurchase and this is the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I absolutely love
this so originally I bought the travel
size of this when I was just like in the
line at Sephora like the little mini one
and I did not know how to use it or what
it was formerly I don't even maybe I got
it for free it was like points or
something I don't know why I had it in
my drawer
so I started setting more my makeup with
it and then I started baking within
stuff you know getting like more
professional and I used the whole travel
size up and I was like I'm going to buy
a new one so I bought the big one this
is talking about more reason it's really
the best so next moving on to like skin
face ish things so these products are
from lush and the first one is I got
this as a valentine's day gift for my
sister so this is like the mini this is
the gorgeous facial moisturizer and
honestly I haven't used it yet at all
cuz I couldn't get the frickin thing
open but I just did they're so cool but
I'm gonna try this because this is like
apparently one of their number one like
facial moisturizers and I'm very very
dry skin so I'm excited to try this
after I wash my face and stuff but this
I have used which is why it's not in
like any wrapping and I forgot the name
of it I'm gonna put it right here in the
thing yeah but this is like an
exfoliating like bar and so me obviously
I get spray tans I've already sent that
a hundred thousand times so when I am
trying to get more of my spray tan off
or if I have taken multiple showers and
still not doesn't seem to come off I use
this and this is just like an
exfoliating bar and I use it the other
day and it seriously made my fit my fin
my fit this is the second time I've said
Finn in a video I seriously don't have a
tail I'm not freaking mermaid so I
really really love this to help get my
spray tan off and it smells really good
it has like a whole entire little flower
if you can see it so cute so the next
three things that I'm going to be
showing you guys are from bareMinerals
and I use them all together when I do
use
so the first thing I use is the bare
minerals oil obsessed oral cleansing oil
and this is basically like the bush of
cleansing makeup breakup cleansing oil
so what I do with this is I like pump
three pumps of it at my hand and I put
it over my makeup like no water on my
face nothing which I think this is where
I was going wrong with my
cleanser I always put water on my face
and then I used it oh no it didn't work
with me I don't think I've followed the
rules but this you literally just like
put the well on your face start like
rubbing it in a little bit and then I
use my Luna and I like exfoliate it in
with that and it seriously takes off all
of the makeup my eye makeup my
everything's like contour full on like
everything comes off and this is
seriously the best of this and my Moshe
like oil are both the same thing but I
feel like I'm leaning more towards this
I don't know I just like the way it
feels on my skin and then after that I
put on the bare minerals skin longevity
vital power infusion so this is just
basically - I don't know this is kind of
like an anti-aging cream I don't with
anti-aging but it's supposed to like it
says skin longevity so it just helps
your skin and it's like I put this on
before I put the moisturizer on just
because I feel like it's like another
little space I don't think my eyes or so
let's just talk about the moisture
because I'm excited about it
so this is the bare minerals butter
drench restore restorative rich cream so
this I use up to I use those two
products and it smells so good oh my
gosh it's just like a little
moisturizing cream finger in it I dab it
all over my face and I rub it in so I
use a bunch of different like
moisturizers and stuff like that
throughout the week I don't use these
three every single time but I feel like
I've been using them a lot more and I
don't know I just I feel like they've
made a difference in my skin a lot and
because I do have very very dry skin I
always am investing in new moisturizers
I don't know I just am all about like
moisturizing my face and so I really
really love this so the next thing that
I'm going to show you I am so beyond
excited about I want to support like
three different times looking for this
and for some reason
so that I mean not for some reason also
now I understand people are buying it
but I was just like I need it and this
is the tartlet in bloom palette and you
guys know I have the regular like the
first tartlet palette love it I
seriously use it like every single day I
use it in my Valentines Day makeup
tutorial I love it so this is more of a
spring oh my gosh it's so beautiful guys
I'll have a close-up right here of the
shades and everything but they are so
gorgeous and beautiful and I just I mean
I have shades like this but I don't know
it's just something about the way these
are all set next to each other like they
just look like they go it's just perfect
so the next things that I'm going to
show you is lip product and I have let
me just I have so many products so the
first things I want to show you guys are
the Maybelline viven matte liquid
lipsticks and I have not used all of
these I have only worn this one and this
is in the shade 5 nude obviously I just
wear new lipsticks all the time you will
see that I think get more into lipsticks
but I wouldn't this one and I really
really loved the I don't I just quit
like I literally dropped something all
the freaking time Ketan get it together
is in nude and then they also have hot
pink shades they have a orange e like
red shade which I'm very excited about
because spring is coming up and you know
what everyone always does like that one
makeup look with like the orange
lipstick yeah I've never had it orange
lipstick and I kind of want to try it
and then this is a red shade and this is
just like fuchsia purple I don't know
they're all really beautiful and I love
the way they feel on my lips I posted an
Instagram picture of them and everyone
was like oh my god those aren't even
matte la la la how they weren't matte um
honestly they're not the most matte lips
like they're not like the MAC lipsticks
like that kind of thing but I actually
like that they're not so drying they
feel moisturizing but look matte enough
to
like be a MATLAB sites and I'm saying
like they didn't just put them in that
on the packaging because doesn't make
sense I think they're amazing and yeah
so I'm excited to try like all nods okay
so next I bought this in the line now at
Sephora and this is the glam glow plump
rageous matte lip treatment so this
basically is like any of the lip
plumpers I don't even know why I bought
this I just thought it'd be funny you
like screw the little old see it you
like screw the top up and then you pop
it out like that and then you put it on
and it basically makes your lips feel
like they're on fire for about 30
minutes and what that does is like
brings the blood to your lips and they
tingle and I don't know it's supposed to
make them bigger I honestly don't really
know if this works that well gonna use
it like twice but I kind of like like
it's an odd like burning sensation and
like in my mouth um on my mouth so yeah
I don't know on my mouth on my lips Lord
okay so the last lip products I'm going
to talk to you about are from colour-pop
so the first one okay so the first two I
bought are actually from Karrueche which
this is the whole reason I even went on
to color pumps website was because
Karrueche posted and she was like k-pop
whatever and you guys don't know like
who court she was like Google or she
like just acting in something she's
really cute and she's perfect I love her
she did it Chris Grande everything okay
anyway she came out with these lip
colors and I was like honestly I want
some weird lip colors to try out like
just because so the first one I bought
is Kay and this one is almost a orange e
yellow brown I don't know it's the
weirdest color but I'm actually so
excited to wear and of course I would
buy all these dark liquid lipsticks
after fall but whatever so this one I
love I'll show a little swatch or
something of me having it on in the
video right here but I actually love
this I love the shade so I think it's
perfect and
the next one I bought is route and this
is almost a maroon but it's like a
deeper brown number and all of these
shades are like more Brown lean more on
the brown side of things but I love the
shade Rouge and then I also bought the
two lip liners with them so this is Kay
and Rouge the lip liner so these two I
bought just like while I was on the
website and the first one is limbo and I
bought this because I thought it would
be like Kylie Jenner's true Brown which
hopefully it is you guys have seen the
video if it's brown I don't know I just
liked it literally looks like poop but I
think it's gonna be great so and then
the next one so this one I bought on the
website and you guys can see here I just
want you to like be my witness to like
look at this look at this it's not
focusing maybe it is focusing but look
at this shape it's so pink and pretty
and I thought it was gonna be a very
nude pink and it is called beaver and
this is the darkest like it when I
pulled it out of like the tube I was
like there is no way this is the color I
bought it's such a dark dark shade it's
like sepia from Anastacio Beverly Hills
and I put it on I've literally put on
today and I took it off it is so dark
and I was kind of sad because I thought
I was gonna get I bought all these dark
shades and I thought I was gonna get a
new changes to go with it and then it
ended up literally being so dark and I
was like okay well I guess I'm gothic
now because I just bought 700 black
shades of lipstick but whatever I love I
mean I still love the color I just wish
I would have known like it just didn't
look like this and that picture at all
so I'm kind of confused about it but
it's okay I'll work with it
so that is it for my makeup haul slash
