they don't smell good Oh what's up guys
so today's video is going to be a makeup
haul / kind of review of things that I
am liking right now so this is a bunch
of stuff that I have recently it
purchased or God or whatever that I love
and I'm not just been using it a lot and
I was like you know what I haven't had a
makeup haul in a long time let's show
you guys some stuff I love um just a
disclaimer i am not sponsored in this
video at all every single product in
this video was i love it i genuinely use
it no one paid me to mention any of this
yes some things may have been sent to me
or stuff like that but I've never been
told to talk about them on social media
or put them in this video I genuinely
love it and use it and that is why I'm
making this video so yeah um let's just
get into it so the first things i want
to show you guys are like face products
I mean everything everything is gonna be
a face product but like like foundation
stuff so the first thing is this makeup
forever Ultra HD foundation and I used
in one of my tutorials and this is what
I don't even know what shape is I don't
know how to read anything but yeah this
is the make up for ever I'm ultra HD
foundation and i love this i use it like
every single day and I haven't had a
spray tan for like a month and so this
shade has I'm working really really good
for what I like I don't have a fresh
right hand but I don't have like no
spray tan so it's like just in the
middle so it's like
Tan kind of pale I know really been
digging it and then the other things are
also from make up forever and this one
is these are primers so you guys know
like our maybe may not you know oh I
don't ever talk about this I don't use a
lot of primers I'm like every once in a
while like up around the primer but I'm
just like okay I don't really know the
difference but these are actually really
really loved so the first one this is a
smoothing primer and this is supposed to
help with your pores I've been wearing
this for like the past three days and
I've just been like focusing it more and
like 21 or whatever it's getting so for
dry skin I use the hydrating primer and
the nourishing primer so I will I kind
of switch it out between these depending
on like what I'm feeling but these both
help with dry skin before you put your
makeup on they're really really good
primers for that not specifically I
don't know if they really make my
makeups down that much longer but yeah I
like them for like a moisturizer kinda
and the next thing as you guys know
obviously have a lot of clinique
products but I'm only going to be
talking about two so the first one is
the line smoothing concealer and this I
have been using a ton and replace of my
Maybelline age rewind I don't really
know why I like just out I just keep
going back to this I think because when
I apply it under my eyes the brush is a
lot more like pointed like you know that
the Maybelline like age rewind one is
like around spongy things which is kind
of like you place it this I can be like
specific and like contour my nose I'm
like I don't put in certain places so I
really liked the applicator I guess of
this and then I don't know I just really
like the color and it kind of looks like
i'm naked on camera i swear i'm wearing
a tank top thing okay whatever um so i
love this and then the other thing from
Clinique is this bronzer and this is in
the shade Sun blushed and i know i just
really like the shade it's super pretty
like a dark it's almost has like hint of
red to it I don't know it's like a red
brown looks kind of like I don't know
just really goes good with my skin tone
and I like it
bronzing so this is actually something I
repurchased and this is the laura
mercier translucent powder and i
absolutely love this so originally I
bought the travel size of this when I
was just like in the line it's for like
a little mini one and i did not know how
to use it or what it was for really i
don't even maybe i got it for free with
like points or something I don't know
why I had it in my drawer so I started
setting more my makeup with it and then
I started baking within stuff you know
getting like more professional and I
used the whole travel size up and I was
like I'm going to buy a new one so i
bought the big one this is talked about
more reason it's really the best so next
moving on to like skin face ish thinks
so these products are from lush and the
first one is I got this as a Valentine's
Day gift for my sister so this is like
the many um this is the gorgeous facial
moisturizer and honestly I haven't used
it yet at all cuz I couldn't get the
freaking thing open but I just did there
so cool but I'm gonna try this because
this is like apparently one of their
number one like facial moisturizers and
I'm very very dry skin so I'm excited to
try this after i wash my face and stuff
but this i have used which is why it's
not unlike any wrapping and i forgot the
name of it i'm gonna put it right here
in the thing yeah but this is like an
exfoliating like bar and so mean
obviously i get spray tans i've already
sent that a hundred thousand times so
when I am trying to get more of my spray
tan off or if I have taken multiple
showers and still not doesn't seem to
come off I use this and this is just
like an exfoliating bar and I use it the
other day and it seriously made my fit
my fin my fit this is the second time
I've said Finn in a video I seriously
don't have a tail I'm not freaking
mermaid so I really really love this to
help get my spray tan off and smells
really good has like a whole entire
little flower if you can see it so cute
so the next three things that I'm going
to be showing guys are from bareMinerals
and I use them all together when I do
use
so the first thing I use is the bare
minerals oil obsessed oral cleansing oil
and this is basically like the bush of
cleansing makeup breakup cleansing oil
so what I do with this is I like pump
three pumps of it at my hand and I put
it over my makeup like no water on my
face nothing which I think this is where
i was going wrong with my
cleanser I always put water on my face
and then i used it i don't didn't work
with me i don't think i followed the
rules but this you literally just like
put the oil on your face start like
rubbing it in a little bit and then i
use my Luna and I like exfoliate it in
with that and it seriously takes off all
of them make it mine I make up my
everything like contour full on like
everything comes off and this is
seriously the best of this and my Moshe
like oil are both the same thing but I
feel like I'm leaning more towards this
I don't know I just like the way it
feels on my skin and then after that I
put on the bare minerals skin longevity
vital power infusion so this is just
basically to I don't know this is kind
of like an anti-aging cream I don't
anti-aging but it's supposed to like it
says skin longevity so it just helps
your skin and it's like I put this on
before I put the moisturizer on just
because I feel like it's like another
little space I don't think motorized or
so let's just talk about the
moisturizers I'm excited about it so
this is the bare minerals butter drench
restore restorative rich cream so this I
use FG I use those two products and it
smells so good oh my gosh it's just like
a little moisturizing cream but a finger
in it i dab it all over my face and I
rub it in so I use a bunch of different
like moisturizers and stuff like that
throughout the week I don't use these
three every single time but i feel like
i've been using them a lot more and i
don't know I just I feel like they've
made a difference in my skin a lot and
because i do have very very dry skin i
always am investing in new moisturizers
i don't know i just am all about like
moisturizing my face and so i really
really love this so the next thing that
i'm going to show you i am so beyond
excited about i want to support like
three
times looking for this and for some
reason almost sold out I mean not for
some reason soda I understand people are
buying it but I was just like I need it
and this is the tartlet in bloom palette
and you guys know I have the regular
like the first tartlet pellet love it I
seriously use it like every single day I
use it in my valentines day makeup
tutorial I love it so this is more of a
spring oh my gosh it's so beautiful guys
up a close-up right here of the shades
and everything but they are so gorgeous
and beautiful and I just I mean I have
shades like this but I don't know it's
just something about the way these are
all set next to each other like they
just look like they go it's just perfect
so the next thinks that i'm going to
show you is lip products and i have let
me just I have so many products so the
first things i want to show you guys are
the maybelline viven matte liquid
lipsticks and i have not used all of
these i have only worn this one and this
is in the shade 5 nude obviously I just
wear new lipsticks all the time you will
see that as I get more into lipsticks
but I've warned this one and I really
really loved um the I don't I I just
quit like I literally dropped something
all the freaking time can't get it
together is it nude and then I also have
hot pink shades they have a orangie like
red shade which I'm very excited about
because spring is coming up and you know
what everyone always does like that one
makeup look with like the orange
lipstick yeah I've never had an orange
lipstick and I kind of want to try it
and then this is a red shade and this is
just like fuchsia purple I don't know
they're all really beautiful and I love
the way they feel on my lips I posted an
Instagram picture of them and everyone
was like oh my god those aren't even
Matt blah la blah how they weren't Matt
honestly they're not the most Matt looks
like they're not like the MAC lipsticks
like that kind of thing but I actually
like that they're not so drying they
feel moisturizing but look Matt enough
to
be a matte lipstick I'm sick but they
didn't just put them in that on the
packaging because it's not mad doesn't
make sense I think they're amazing and
yes I'm excited to try like all nods
okay so nice i bought this in the line
now at sephora and this is the glam glow
plump rageous matte lip treatment so
this basically is like any of the lip
plumpers I don't even know I bought this
I just thought it'd be funny you like
screw the little can't even see it you
like screw the top up and then you pop
it out like that and then you put it on
and it basically makes your lips feel
like they're on fire for about 30
minutes and what that does is like
brings the blood to your lips and they
tingle and I don't know it's supposed to
make them bigger I honestly don't really
know what this works that well then use
it like twice but I kind of like like
it's an odd like burning sensation in
like in my mouth um on my mouth so yeah
I don't know on my mouth on my lips Lord
okay so the last lip products i'm going
to talk to you about our from colour-pop
so the first one okay so the first two i
bought are actually from carucci which
this is the whole reason I even went on
to color pops website was because
Karrueche posted and she was like kpop
whatever if you guys don't know like who
perches like Google or she like just
acting sudden she's really cute and
she's perfect I love her she didn't
Chris Brown everything okay anyway she
came out with these lip colors and I was
like honestly I want some weird with
colors to try out like just because so
the first one I bought is K and this one
is almost a orangie yellow brown I don't
know it's the weirdest color but I'm
actually so excited to wear and of
course i would buy all these dark liquid
lipsticks after fall but whatever so
this one I love I'll show a little
swatch or something of me having it on
in the video right here but I actually
love this I love the shade so I think
it's perfect and
the next one I bought is root and this
is almost a maroon but it's like a
deeper brown number all of these shades
are like more Brown lean more on the
brown side of things but I love the
shade Rouge and then I also bought the
two lip liners with them so this is K
and ruched the lip liner so these two I
bought just like while i was on the
website and the first one is limbo and i
bought this because i thought it would
be like Kylie Jenner's true brown which
hopefully it is you guys have seen the
video if it's brown I don't know I just
liked it literally looks like poop but I
think it's gonna be great so and then
the next one so this one I bought on the
website and you guys can see here I just
want you to like be my witness to like
look at this look at this it's not
focusing maybe it is focusing but look
at this shape it's so pink and pretty
and I thought it was going to be a very
nude pink and it is called beeper and
this is the darkest like it when I
pulled it out of like the tube I was
like there's no way this is the color I
bought it's such a dark dark shade it's
like sepia from Anastasia Beverly Hills
and I put it on I've literally put on
today and I took it off it is so dark
and I was kind of sad because I thought
I was gonna get I bought all these dark
shades and I thought I was gonna get a
nude shade just to go with it and then
it ended up literally being so dark and
I was like okay well I guess I'm gothic
now because i just bought seven hundred
black shades of lipstick but whatever i
love i may I still love the color I just
wish I would have known like it just
didn't look like
and that picture at all so I'm kind of
confused about it but it's okay I'll
work with it so thatís it for my makeup
haul / like current favorite stuff i've
been loving so i hope you guys like this
