my mother and we're wearing our cute
little Christmas sweaters and today
we're going to show you kind of sort of
probably end up not showing you but I'm
gonna show you how to make we're
probably gonna end up like not really
telling every step so that's not gonna
happen
but we're going to be making sugar
cookies and then we're gonna like to
decorate them and stuff but while we're
doing it so it's not so extremely boring
Hannah which is on the side you're not
gonna see here she's going to be asking
us questions that you guys sent in on
Twitter so before I ask the questions we
will know we haven't seen Zoe yeah we
have not seen the questions so they're
going to be really ok mom I don't know
how to bake these oh okay good job if I
said this is my recipe good news have
you got everything ready so it's whining
1/3 cup sure so I just don't deserve it
in there you're gonna like creamed
together like the shortening and sugar
and the vanilla this shortening all of
this sugar yes this is one and a half
cups of sugar one and a half cups that's
a lot of sugar cookie but like that's
sugar that's what it is okay so if you
want to die just keep following the
recipe and then 2 teaspoons of vanilla
which I didn't do come on just good
skill one this is so good right we start
off doing this with an easy the easy
question come on what's your favorite
Christmas movie okay so my favorite
Christmas movie is probably how the
grinch stole christmas or
elf like the basics mine
the holiday not even just like my
favorite traditions you know okay this
question was asked like six times so I
think I should ask it okay
what's your favorite thing to do
together bake these cookies
Oh cause I'm not freaking babies with
you right now
oh yeah your PIN you know Gossip Girls
so oh my say that what both well they
know either like I love like your turn
it's your you're a first-timer
I love it I love like I'm were on season
three so like I think like the first or
second episode right yeah no we would
yeah really enjoyed getting we're
getting three
so I love it who's your favorite
character I love I love Serena's hair
it's very pretty like Blair having a
daughter that just looks so much like
okay this is style in that now you can
do it a little bit more and then two
eggs you can tell me we're going at Jim
today's where does your mom see you in
ten years blue that's a good one it's a
question for you because they said where
did your mom see they're asking you
there I only trying you mean where do
you see Keaton in ten years
okay this is good right gonna put this
freaking egg in here because my in ten
years I see
living right down the street for me I
don't know what else other than like in
Texas by me and not oh yeah by the way
I'm gonna leave the recipe in the
description I can do that right mom this
is Lily yes super this is a really
question this is really a Twinkie
this is the next question what's
something that annoys you about each
other
the only did not really annoys me and
this probably surprising to them but
like you always want to take pictures of
grouchy and like when I don't want
pictures like she's literally always
taking pictures like more than me so
like when I'm hella grumpy she always
wants to take a picture and I just don't
feel like it that's the only kind
probably like for the most part she
really like like but it's like on her
own time so whenever I'm so when we try
to provide not a FRA information from
her and she doesn't want to give it
she's very annoyed yeah I'm annoyed me I
was good I really this I want to know
it's a really that probably analogy
about me yeah I was gonna say that like
when you like try and ask me stuff and
I'm not in the mood to talk about it
it's like oh well
okay
my camera cut out lovely so what I did
was I poured what did I pour you cups of
flour two cups of flour but you're gonna
do four cups of flour actually but I'm
just mixing this together so pana you
may start asking oh my gosh what's one
of y'all's funniest moments together
don't we do that
oh the Casey jr. thing was if I can find
this video I'm freakin posing over I'm
gonna put it right here I've got here
this myth we live with to Disneyland and
we made her bride she does not do
rollercoasters I only made her ride not
even like a ferris will roll up it like
I don't like literally nothing I didn't
carousel so she gets on this ride at
Disney okay it was Disney World and it's
the Casey jr. ride so literally the name
of it and the limbo
in the little kid area we're like you
can ride this it's fun so she gets on it
and I decided to record her well seize
that next to me and it's probably one of
the funniest videos of everything of her
like Miley online I look very very much
anamorphic um so if I can find it I want
to put over here and reminding it it
will seem like it needs something like
milk because we didn't put it open are
we supposed to open it for teaspoons and
they'll cover up I think we have to
bring it out not home
what's today it's fine
well that started to subside the second
but you know it's not it literally says
let's see simper second smell but we're
good a little milk didn't hurt anyone
all right guys so you put so we can do
this over the sink three or these are
this recipe is for frosted sugar cookies
so if you're just gonna make like a
Russian cookies
like sprinkle sugar McDonald's don't use
this dough on there we just have like a
little not doing this all on yep I
always use powdered sugar like a lot of
people use flour to roll it on ours you
kind of sugar because it makes the dough
like a little bit sweeter what's your
favorite thing to do together at
Christmas time Christmas tree of Luigi
whoa
this is getting crazy I mean maybe not
that's probably not like just the two of
us but like I like to do our gingerbread
house party so I've had that like every
year we just do our have all her friends
and kids it's okay so she puts
shortening on this pan to like instead
of putting grease on it because it
doesn't work that well and then we're
gonna just cut these cookies out and lay
them on the pan who can hold their
breath so let's find out one you know
you're gonna do it yeah do it come on
mom
one two three mom what's wrong with this
dough it's broke do we need to drive our
breath-holding again you know because
you messed up okay fine we'll do it
again today
come one two three
thank you okay so basically we just cut
out a bunch of Christmas tree we put
them in the oven at 375 degrees for
seven minutes
and then we let them cool and they're
right here and then we have one shaped
like gingerbread men in the oven right
now but we're going to make the icing
now right yeah we're going to make the
icing now but you can put in on your
sugar cookies and then we can decorate
them okay so basically this is just
powdered sugar think about you going to
college
what here I know unless they don't cry
I mean I'm sad about it but like I want
I'm excited for her like whatever to be
happy what no wherever so we have all of
our cookies here and now we're just
going to take the icing in the spoon and
put it on there yeah when I say really
just fancy the sprues gonna pour some
sprinkles on the cookies but you get the
gist what is your favorite Justin Bieber
song uh-huh
you can't do that Hannah which overt
album I'll rephrase that one um I really
like my world 2.0 like that one has some
Janis lights going like overboard and
like nut up and why was that I was
awarded my favorite yeah Arizona I
