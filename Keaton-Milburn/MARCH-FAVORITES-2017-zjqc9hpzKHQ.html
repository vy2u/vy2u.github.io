really love these loving them for the
month of March and so I wanted to
mention them the next few products are
at beauty products so the first one I'm
going to show you guys is this glam glow
wet lip balm treatment so I before I go
to bed I click check we've got eye
so United before I go to bed it's like
constantly dropping it and always always
always applying chapstick I was applying
like aqua for like Vaseline and stuff
like that just because I let's just I do
but recently I got this glam glow wet
lip balm and it smells like so menti and
it just I don't know it feels really
good on my lip so I think this is just
on my new favorite especially because I
like the packaging of it like I like
that it's just like this little round
ball I don't know so I love this right
now the next few products are from Too
Faced and everyone has used these
products but I just recently got a
package from them of like a bunch of
things that I have never used from them
but everyone else like already been
using so I'm Way behind on both of these
already know but the first one is the
chocolate Soleil bronzer and I never use
this I don't know why I was always just
like a hula benefit kind of girl but you
know really into this and smells like
chocolate it literally smells so good I
think you can like don't do that don't
do it I just said don't do it
yeah the next thing is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara and this mascara
is amazing okay
like honestly I was so I was sleeping on
the mascara I really really really was I
feel like I just thought it was so hyped
up I was so like just whatever was my
own mascara like oh she's like and I
already have one but this busker is
amazing both of these products I'm so
like turning on a book there's a mark
here now from where I just lived it okay
the last product is from colour-pop and
it is this like I shadow pellets kind of
things these are like individual I wish
I had like the colors or like the shades
of whatever they are I don't know what
it's called
I'll try and find on the website and
link it down below but this is just been
a perfect I go to everyday I shadow look
for me I literally like follow it step
by step
I literally set my eyelid with this
color I put this in my crease and then I
Steven it up with this and I put the
metallic shade on the center of my lid
and it just like be perfect look for me
I just have I want it's been going with
this how I also think what color pop is
student right now it's amazing their
whole like monochromatic line like lip
colors and eye shadow
everything have been really really good
on their part I don't know I'm really
into it so I love this the Mexican wanna
talk about it's so random and it is this
beautiful drink so this empty coconut no
this is not a coconut this is the green
tea latte with coconut milk in it and
actually love this ice is very much a
green tea kind of girl like green tea
anything I will buy it like at like I
don't know what it is just like I'm
obsessed with green tea and the other
day not even led I've been drinking this
for like two months tree I get this
every single day like without a DA to
get this every day and I was waiting in
line for my Starbucks treat and the girl
in front of me they called her drink on
they were like green tea wat they were
coconut milk and they handed her this
and I was like wait stop what is that
because I heard her fat and then the
next time I went back and I got it and I
got it every day since
so whoever that wanted to order this in
front of me if they put me on this and
it is amazing if you guys are into green
tea I recommend if you guys don't like
green tea obviously don't get this so
the camera keeps cutting out but the
last things I want to share with you
guys it's music you guys know I have a
Spotify playlist every single month you
guys are like super into my Spotify
which makes me really happy that you
guys like say music is me because I love
music it is my life
so a few favorites from my playlist

in there like there's not one I really
skip ever my favorite from Drake's album

I like nothings into some things I also
like can't have everything in since way
back I like do not disturb a lot and
with all those also I'm not a really big
Trey Songz fan like I like if you know
