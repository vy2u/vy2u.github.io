honestly thinking about like taking my
hair down for this video I'm fixing it
but it's just what I look like so what's
up guys so today's video is going to be
my March favorites obviously feels weird
saying more check I feel like the month
just go by so so quickly why does my
camera look slanted that's what's up
let's straighten you guys oh ok anyway I
know the months have been going by so
fast but I don't have a ton of favorites
so I'm just going to hop right into it
so the first favorites i'm going to
start with our beauty products and so
the first one is this perfume and i
posted this on my Instagram this is from
anthropology and it's just the vanilla I
don't know I don't know it's just a
vanilla scented perfume and I wear this
almost every single day and I have
always been looking for a perfume that
stays on all day i'll literally sprayed
on at seven o'clock in the morning and
at seven o'clock at night so don't be
like oh my god you smell good and I'm
like it lasted so I'm very obsessed with
this and it's only eighteen dollars next
is this CC cream and this is by eight
cosmetics I use this in my last tutorial
and this is the UM shade medium and I'm
wearing it on my skin today I have it
and also I have it in tan and that is
when I have a spray tan on because I'm a
little bit darker but I really really
love the coverage you guys know I talked
about this so I love this and if you are
looking for a CC cream kind of like a
foundation but like not as much coverage
I would seriously recommend trying this
out the next thing I also have been
liking is the gurney our skin active
clearly brighter it's basically
brightening and smoothing daily
moisturizer so this you can put on
before your makeup or if you're not even
going to wear any makeup and it has SPF
in it but it's also a moisturizer so
because I've been tanning a lot and like
the Sun outside I've been going out a
lot and it's getting a lot more hot I
like putting this on because I don't
know it just I feel like it's like
helping my skin like it's helping
protect my skin at the same time it's
also moisturizing it because I very very
dry skin so I love this and it smells
good
yeah I'd like that um the last beauty
products is this sigma brush and this is
the brow highlighting pencil and there's
a pink side and a shimmery side yet use
a shimmery side because I love the way
the pink turns out but they also have
one of these like by benefit but they
sell them separate like you can buy just
the pink one or just the shimmery one
and I just like line my brows with this
makes them look I was at fleek yeah I
hate that word so that is all for the
beauty products now the next time going
to talking about is a book and this is
sandcastle kings by rich Wilkerson jr.
this is meeting Jesus in a spiritually
bankrupt world and i have been reading
this with like a group of like my mom
and my sister and a bunch of her friends
because we have bible study and so we
read this book and then we talk about it
every week and i love this book I don't
know I just feel like I don't know I
just love everything this book says and
I don't really want to like talk too
deep into I think like if you're just
interested in this you should definitely
go check it out I know um he has been
like seeing him like Justin Bieber's
Instagram and stuff like that but he's
come to our church a few times and
spoken and he's one of my favorite
people ever I've met him before and I
think this I don't know I just love this
book and I love him so if you guys are
interested I would recommend checking
this book out the next thing is kind of
like a fashion favorite ish but it is
this bathing suit like I said I've been
tanning a lot and I've been wearing this
bathing suit by triangle so the bottoms
are like neon they're so bright and then
the top is just this like triangle
floral bathing suit I'll leave the name
of like which one this is down below I
have a few triangle bathing suits but
this one I just been like going to
because it makes me feel like I'm Tanner
neon colors make me look a little bit
brighter so I've definitely been loving
that and then the other thing I beloved
is a sweatshirt and it says beauty yeah
it says beautycon I thoughts of you in
Dallas cuz i got at beauty calm dallas
and i literally wear this like every
single day like did you go to beautycon
no I just yeah I don't know i really
like it it's really comfortable on the
subject of like youtube events and stuff

very excited about so if you guys are
going comment in the comments below if
you just live in the area or if you guys
