be another favourites video and it is my
March favorites as you can see because
that is the past month and yeah um we're
just gonna jump right into it cuz I'm
super excited to show you guys the first
item in my favorites and I don't know
let's just get into it so I recently got
this package in the mail and I'm going
to explain it to you what it is so
basically I was contacted by Warby
Parker and I absolutely love Warby
Parker like I was so excited I bought
these glasses exactly a year ago today
perfect oh my gosh I'm obsessed with
them and you guys always comment in my
videos like where your glasses Brown
when I post on Instagram in them all the
time and you guys are almost like oh my
gosh I love those where they from and
they're actually from Warby Parker Warby
Parker is an online store that you can
go to and you can actually send your own
prescription in and you can send your
prescription in and you can buy glasses
the really cool thing about Warby Parker
is that you can take five pair and you
can send them to your house completely
free zero cost like there's literally no
cost you can pick out five glasses from
the store send them to your house to
ride them on and then whichever ones you
like you can buy them if there are 95
dollars and they're amazing like they're
the cutest glasses ever and it's
completely free to try them on so like
say you don't like any of them send them
back but you can like send another five
pair to your house and get it for free
and it cost nothing so it's really
really awesome I'm gonna show you guys
the process because I've just picked out
five pair online so you guys can comment
below which ones you like the best and I
will read you the names and everything
in case you want to go get them but yeah
so this one home looks like you have a
little try on things so you can put
notes on your first impressions about
the frames there's a number you can call
get questions about and then it comes
with all the names of them so let's open
these bad boys up oh my gosh I'm just so
excited
this one is called striped sassafras oh
these are really cute obviously they're
like really reflective right now cuz
these aren't prescription lenses in them
but these are so cute
I like these I like the color of them
it's like a really light tortoise eat
color I don't know what do you guys
think the next pair is Chamberlain
they're another tortoise I really like
tortoise so that's why I picked this up
oh these are cute I think these are more
boxy I love these two though so
disgusting oh my gosh I'm going to end
up buying all five pair rubbers
the third pair is what are these called
Duvall blue these are really cute guys
okay so y'all are gonna judge me for
picking out a pair of blue glasses but
they're so pretty I'm gonna do a
close-up you guys didn't see these but
they're so pretty guys they're just like
ombre blue they're dark on the top let's
check them out hi everyone really
obsessed these they're kind of like
winged right here if you guys could see
that that's really cute these are the
third pair tell me what you think
okay so these are tortoise but they're
also really these are thin on the sides
see this took a little wire ooh I like
these these are called Baxter Baxter
here we go these are cool I like the
feeling of like the the skinniness
that feels really really cool like it's
not chunky they caught my ear the last
pair is gnashed in whiskey tortoise
shape I really only like tortoise so
that's my problem but these are kind of
chunkier and they're more they're not as
squared as all the rest
they're kind of didn't know I like these
so leave a comment in the comments below
and tell me which pair of glasses you
liked best and which ones I should get
because I'm really kind of obsessed with
all of them and I'm probably gonna have
a hard time picking out which ones I
want so once you pick out the ones you
want you can send it back and they give
you this on post-its you can send it
back and everything it's completely free
and then once that's done you can go
online to your account and then you
order the ones that you picked out and
it has it all there for you and you
could send your prescription in if you
already have one from my doctor so if
you guys wanna check out Warby Parker I
have a link for you guys down below and
I'll list it right here and you can use
it and get free a three day shipping
which is amazing and I genuinely really
really love this company and I have
bought my glasses from there and I
absolutely love it so if you guys want
to check it out I will leave you down
below so yeah I really don't have a lot
of favorites for this month but I am
gonna show you guys a few things so the
first thing I want to show you guys is
is the not your mother's beach babe
texturizing hair cream so I have to
spray which out right here actually I
broke it and it's built all over my
floor but I have that but I have really
really been trying not to use a lot of
heat on my hair and I've gone like a
week and a half without using any heat
like I don't bulge on my hair and I'm
straight
don't curl it I don't do anything I just
like let it air-dry whatever I really
really love this and it's just been
helping me not use so much to eat
because I am trying to grow my hair and
make it healthier and stuff so yeah the
next thing I love is actually on my hand
so I have been using a lot of new nail
polishes this month because I have been
trying not to get fake nails and I've
been trying to quit biting my nails
which I do a lot and it's really really
bad habit so I've actually grown my
nails out guys look at this you guys
probably wouldn't even notice but I love
like my nails being my actual nails and
not fake and being good quality you know
but I have been using a lot of nail
polish but the one I've recently had
really been loving is this one that is
by Essie it is called
bikini so teeny and I thought that was
the cutest name whenever I picked it out
um but I never never wear blues I always
wear either a really really light pink
or a cream or like a great but I never
ever wear blues or anything like that so
I just want to try to stop I don't know
it's becoming spring and I'm just super
excited about it
the last beauty product is kind of
beauty ish but it's from the lush and it
is bubbled are I don't remember the
exact name of it so I'll leave it down
below but I've used about half of it
I've been taking so many baths this
month I don't know that's just believe
my stress and then bubbles on top of
that it's just like Oh like heaven guys
I just I really really love bubble baths
and lush has the best bubble bars ever
the last few things on my talked to you
guys about our random favorites and my
first random favorite for this month so
these are blueberries dipped in dark
chocolate and I love dark chocolate more
than regular milk chocolate and they
actually have these in crabbers I eat
the whole bag of cranberries which is
why I have the blueberry one now
um but I just love child that covered
anything and if you guys have had the
pomegranate ones of these these are like
the same thing but they're made by dove
and there are blueberries which I've
never had before so I really really love
these the next favorite I showed you
guys in my outfit of the week and it is
these beautiful shoes and look they
literally reflect off of everything like
my studio light it's reflecting off of
it right now
I love these a lot because I don't have
colored Nikes I normally just have black
or gray and I've been trying to get into
more colors if you guys can tell out my
nails all that stuff you know as I wear
like a black and white striped shirt
lastly I want to share with you guys my
music favorites and I haven't had a ton
this month but the ones that I have had
I wasn't due on repeat so this month
I've been loving new problems by Cody
Simpson somebody to you featuring Demi
Lovato and I went saw the movie the Dove
which was actually a really really cute
movie and on the credits and played this
song and it's by the vamps and I haven't
really ever been a fan of the big ups
but now I think I'm starting to be
because they really like this song um
the next song is Wonderland by Taylor
Swift and this isn't on her elbow like
on iTunes I don't actually know how I
even got it but it is on the deluxe you
can buy it like at Target or ever but I
mean I think it's on iTunes I don't know
if you have to buy the whole album to
get it but it is probably one of my
favorite songs by Taylor Swift it's a
door featuring ariana grande it's by
cashmere cat but like the whole song is
basically ariana grande you know but
it's really really good and I saw her in
concert and I like cried and you guys
can see you might get ready with me down
below it was amazing so yeah you can
check that out the songs I've been
loving are by BM Miller I'm not sure
that's how you say her name it's B II am
sure it's Bo Miller and I found her I
might be really late on her music and
might be like bandwagoning on this
bandwagoning word um but I saw it on
iTunes that she had like a new EP or
album or whatever and so I bought
Youngblood Fire &amp;amp; Gold enemy fire and
Dracula and I really really love those
my last favorite for this month would
have to be my all-time favorite I know I
listed all this other stuff but my last
favorite would definitely be you guys
and if the reason I'm saying that is not
only because you guys are also and like
all my videos and comment on all my
videos and tweet me and comment to me
all the time but you guys have got me to
a hundred
subscribers and that is completely
insane to think that a hundred thousand
people watch my videos like 100,000
people watched my videos I don't know I
just think that's insane and so I just
want to thank you guys so much for doing
that and always supporting me and liking
my videos and commenting and doing
everything that you guys do you guys
make me extremely happy and I went to
California for a whole week by the way
that was definitely one of my March
favorites I got to go and like have
amazing opportunities and a lot of it
wouldn't even be possible about you guys
and I got to meet some of you guys while
I was there I met one girl there and she
was so so nice so anyway I just want to
thank you guys so much for making this
month awesome and yeah in order to thank
