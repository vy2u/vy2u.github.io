to be a massive makeup haul and this is
seriously not even all of the new
products I have right now I went to
beauty con and I honestly like went to
Sephora
for like the first time in a really long
time and just like browse around and
like bought things that I'd normally
wouldn't have picked out so it's been
really really fun experimenting with all
this new makeup and if you guys like
seen videos where like I tell you what
I'm liking at the moment stuff like that
let me know also I'm super white right
now it's super wash it out but whatever
okay um so I use a lot of new products
on my face today and I've been using
them like the past few weeks to get
ready so I'm gonna just hop right into
it because it's actually like a lot so
yeah let's just get right into it the
first thing I want to show you guys is
these color tattoos and they are by
Maybelline and these are all metallic I
have bronze sheen beige luster and
electric emerald I obviously haven't
used electric enroll because it's like
really really green but the mermaid look
I did in my last video I was like this
would be so good to recreate like a
different kind of eye look with it it's
like the prettiest like mermaid eye
color but these are basically eyeshadows
and there's so so pigmented I don't ever
use like the liquid eye shadow like I
tattoo kind of things but with these I'm
like okay wait I'm so into this so I
used to love Urban Decay and it's not
that I stopped loving them I just kind
of like didn't buy as many of their
products as I normally would but
recently I got these two this is the
Naked skin color correcting fluid so
these are like these are color
correctors but they're like in little
tube so this is the yellow one and this
is the purple one and I don't know I
just really think that these are perfect
you guys are really really into color
correcting I've want to get a green one
I don't know if they actually have a
green one but I really want a green one
because I get like a red little
blemishes everywhere and that would be
so helpful while doing is my makeup
right now I use like the Tarte color
correcting palette thing but I love
these because it's so easy litter you
can just dump dot it on like draw it on
wherever you want
it's amazing you don't have a brush and
a palette and all that kind of stuff
and they blend super super well so if
you guys are into color correcting I
would definitely try these from Urban
Decay okay so this next thing from urban
together this is what I'm like so into
them right now I like forgot that I'm in
love with him but this is the Urban
Decay Clyde on I pencil and they've had
these eye pencils like forever but this
is whiskey and this is the prettiest
Brown I thought so I have it on my out
of my lid right now and alike my inner
corner and I absolutely love it and if
you guys have never had Urban Decay eye
pencils before just go buy one and your
whole life is gonna be changed I have
this in two other colors like a blue and
some like a darker Brown I love this one
this is whiskey and it just like a
really natural like smoky and then the
last two things from Urban Decay are
just eyes shadows and this is vanilla by
Urban Decay it's the prettiest white
shadow oh my gosh and these are so
pigmented and this one is chase and I'm
pretty sure these are like really
popular colors that they have in these
urban decay but I think they're amazing
the vanilla one I love for my brow bone
my inner corner I use it on the center
of my lid today just to like make my
eyes look bigger and whatnot but I
absolutely love this and then I just
love any neutral Brown sup cheese is
amazing for that now going into it
cosmetics I got this by by porous primer
and I love this stuff I'm seriously I
think I'm in love with this um I don't
know I haven't really ever used like
pore primers before I've used one my
makeup forever but I just really like
this because I'm also feels like it's
kind of moisturizing you and it is
filling your pores which is kind of hard
to do because every time I'm using a
pore primer I feel like my pores are
getting clogged it just feels really
really gross but I actually love the way
this feels it's so smooth
I know it's amazing so if you're looking
for a port primer that is affordable a
cosmetics okay I forgot to mention these
two by Maybelline yeah these are people
so this is the gray over it these are
lipsticks but they're not matte
lipsticks they're like I don't think
they're bad because the one I used
wasn't mad okay this one's matte but
this one is the bold muted
true intro nude throw stuff um these are
gorgeous so so creamy I have these in a
black and white I have these lipsticks
in black and white and I think I'm gonna
try and create like a different kind of
Halloween look with them because I don't
I love black lipstick and then wait time
you're never really weird it's Halloween
so I'm gonna try and do that but I
absolutely love these lipsticks and I
was really really surprised with how
easy they were to apply on my lips I
don't really like I don't know it was
amazing I'm obsessed with these so I
highly recommend these okay next is this
NYX love contours all which the name
like come on this is so cute so this is
a palette I have not used everything in
this palette today I use this
highlighter right here and then I use
this bronzer or like contour shade and I
think they're amazing it has nine
different eyeshadows to contour shades
to highlights and then I can't remember
what the bottom two are oh these don't
for your eyebrows so I think this is
amazing
the highlight was actually really good I
was really surprised looking for a
contour palette that's just like easy
you can I throw it in your bag and it's
ready to go it has seriously like
eyebrow contour highlight and eye shadow
like this is an amazing palette to just
like pop in your travel bag
okay next these two items are from Laura
Geller and I've never tried any of her
products and then when I got these I was
like oh wait I love so this is a
highlight actually this is amazing
it's like swirly and it is in gilded
honey I think this is like one of her
best-selling ones I think like everyone
likes this but this is amazing I love
putting thanks max but max huh Mac fix
plus and then putting this on my leaky
boats everywhere oh my god it's just
amazing I love this I'm obsessed with
highlighting right now so that's why I'm
like really into like shimmery products
as you'll see because the next product
is this just blushing palette and it has
super pretty blush shades but they all
are shivering and they're so gorgeous
and I think that I'm in love okay I
literally have so many Maybelline
products I actually am so done okay so
today I used this master contour skit I
like literally is English do I even
speak English okay no I use my master
contoured sticks today which I was super
skeptical about this because I was like
how can you have a high light side and a
contour side and one stick and it not
like a mess-up
I don't know just like sketches me I
think that's like me being weird I don't
like with like things are like touching
like that I don't know how to describe
it but I was like this doesn't work and
I used it today and I love it I love
this shade this like this contour they
have them in buncha different shades but
this one is white Claire number 10 I
love this shade I think it's amazing I
use it to highlight and I contoured with
it today and it blended so so easily
like I was actually so impressed with
this so if you guys are looking for a
little contour stick like this I would
suggest this because it blended so
easily and I don't know makes me look
good I think and then next I could not
talk to you guys about this enough this
is the Maybelline the falsies push-up
angle yeah yeah that's what this is and
when I took this out I was like you
what is this brush like it's literally
it's barely even a brush it's a Chinese
thing I've ever seen but I've never like
been more house with her mascara than
this I use this and it seriously like
makes my lashes so much like have so
much more money
it is like the push-up one so wearing
lifts my lashes up so much and then I
add roller lash on top of it just to
like give a little more volume but I
absolutely love this and you guys like
struggle
like separating your lashes and things
like that which I struggle with I would
highly suggest this because it's like
the perfect brush for that I went out of
my comfort zone and I bought a
foundation stick because everyone is
talking about this and this is the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation stick if
I hear one more person say that I'm
gonna be like okay but it actually is
amazing I am in the shade one two three
why three six so that is my shade and I
actually love it I don't know if it's my
favorite foundation like everyone's like
this is replaced all my other
foundations I don't know if it really
did that for me I really just like
liquid foundations like that's just like
I don't know I'll never blending this
out it's like too much work for me like
I'm so lazy I just want to take a brush
and like throw it all over my face but I
really do like the coverage that this
gives me like you would think a stick
like this which is gonna in but it
really is full coverage and absolutely
love it and you can build it up however
you want this is the last makeup product
and then I have beauty products so I
told you guys this was gonna be a bigger
haul and I'm trying to talk quickly one
because my camera styling and two I
don't know where you guys too much but
this is the elf cosmetics there's no
freaking name on this by the way and
like I got it said to me and I tried it
out today
I'm obsessed guys I pretty sure this is
just like their like HD like powder
whatever this is I used it to like bake
my face and like I did my contour with
this a I'm I'm actually so impressed
with this honestly I was gonna go in
with my Laura Mercier one and then I was
like oh wait I want to try this and
after I did I was like I don't even want
to go back to my Laura Mercier I'm like
that's how much I love this stuff which
kind of shocks me because I'm super like
on the bandwagon of the like powder by
Laura Mercier but I love this and I'm
gonna try this out for a little bit more
if it has like flashback and stuff I'll
let you guys know but I really love this
right now okay so now I'm gonna talk
about beauty products so these are by
L'Oreal I say these because I have two
other ones I have like the black one and
the red one and all three of the masks
print things and I am a huge fan of
masks I used one this morning like right
when I woke up I put one on and I I
genuinely like loved math so when I got
these I was like this is amazing
and what I really love about this is
that these are affordable and like do
exactly what a higher and mask would do
there's two other ones and they do
different things so like say you had
like to clear up a spot right here you
can put the agree one on and then you're
like oh I need to put the black one here
though and then I want to put the red
one here if you can mix them they all do
different things for your face though
and I think that's really awesome and
they're affordable they're awesome
and they're by L'Oreal like you remember
if I said that but I love them right now
so next thing is this this is also by Ed
cosmetics and it is by by makeup so this
is the three-in-one makeup melting
cleansing balm and I was really
skeptical of this because I don't like
oily things on my face like I don't like
oils I don't know it really don't it
irks me but this is kind of oily but
this is just literally like a melting
bomb and this takes off your makeup like
that like if I even like touch my hand
in this slightly and like I actually
like move my face like my makeup is
completely gone so I normally use this
after I wash my face I like get my eye
makeup off with this
I get my eye makeup off with this and
today I was doing like a bunch of
swatches on my arm and I'd like took one
cotton pad on this and I wiped off and I
was literally gone it's amazing so if
you guys are looking for like different
eye makeup a move that you want to like
test out I would highly recommend this I
think that's awesome
and yeah it's really good okay so this
next product is by Kiehl's and this is
the ultimate straight pant sound
whatever I almost said I don't know what
I will say but everyone talks about this
and people have always talked about this
but I am just now getting it and in that
letter that I'm literally gonna use it
right now because I'm obsessed with it
but my hands I'm so annoying why did I
have to do this or I know I hate myself
obviously I always talked about this
I've really really dry skin my hands get
really really dry and my everything
is really dry that sounded gross but I
mean like my arms and legs okay moving
on um so keeping this in my purse is
like a lifesaver also it smells like
like the stress relief like I don't know
it's venti like spearmint and also I
don't know it just makes me so happy
because my hands always get so dry hey
finally the last three product pop I
just want to speak English one day okay
the last three products are from hello
to sexy legs I think that's like the
name of the brand because like it's say
hello to sexy legs that's like the name
of these this stuff so this is the say
hello to sexy legs tinted glow gel and
honestly it's like you don't even have
to use just for Lux I use it on my chest
but it is maintaining it's not a
self-tanner it literally says like not a
self-tanner on it but it does like build
up you can build up your tan with this
and it has like chien in it I don't know
it just looks really really pretty on
your legs basically it's supposed to
make them like glow I went to a day
party yesterday and I used all three of
these products because I was like I'm
not really gonna be swimming but like I
want to look tan and bronzed and cute so
I use this on my legs and also my chest
cuz I don't know I'm good like that and
then this is these say hello to sexy
legs contour stick and I know you guys
are gonna be like you are some extra you
do not contour your legs like shut up
okay but this contour stick is so
amazing and I'm not even gonna lie you
can literally do what everyone this you
can contour your boobs with this if
you're going to add a party because I
went to different yesterday and I was
like you can literally contour your
boobs with this or you cut your legs
with this you could I don't even know
there's so many different things you can
do with this and just like blend it out
it's really easy to blend out so this is
a contour stick for your legs which I
don't know I probably will never contour
in my life to that but you never know
and then this is the say hello to sexy
legs illuminating fluid and this is
highlighter which I think this is so
cool that you can like do all the stuff
but like with your body like how people
do with their face but I mean like I
don't laid all this
I think it's really cool it's really
cool ideas so I use this yesterday when
I went to a party and I put on like my
collar bones and like the Shen's
of like my leg so I just look more like
I just woke up like some sun kissed I
don't know I think it's really cool I'm
not gonna spray it right now but I
thought this trio of things was really
awesome and I was actually really
surprised because I never used anything
by this brand so I was like this is so
cool so yes if you guys are looking for
anything around this if you guys are
ever wanting to try anything out like
this I would highly recommend these
these are awesome oh my gosh
okay so that is all the products I have
for you guys I honestly like I know it
seems like how could you possibly have
more products in this I literally have
so many like other skin care products
