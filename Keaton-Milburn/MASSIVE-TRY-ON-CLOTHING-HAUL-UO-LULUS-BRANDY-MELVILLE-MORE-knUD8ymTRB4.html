further into the video I look like the
post very dull boy I understand
I see the rolls I see them just do of
them also my lighting is so I'm blind
and blind because of lighting right now
but it's really dark outside and I
really want to Thomas for you guys so it
can or the awful crap lighting what's up
guys so today's video is going to be a
haul and you guys have requested this so
much I asked you guys want to see a try
and haul and you all said yes so I am
filming it for you guys
so again if you guys have never seen one
of my husband for I'm going to just be
showing you guys the clothes and then
obviously there's going to be some
little footage of me having it on right
there I'll see if you guys aren't yet
subscribe to my channel please click the
little red button down below and
subscribe because it means a lot and
like this favorite you guys like it and
let's get into the video so I have a ton
of things from a ton of different stores
I'm going to show you guys and this is
obviously been over time and not just by
all of us at the same time but yeah so
let's start with uh like the smallest
amount so this is from brandy melville
so the first item I got is this little
blue like it's like periwinkles
basically it's a periwinkle tank top and
I really really loved I don't know I
just love the color of this and I also
have it in white and just like the
straps little ties in the front this
whole like Lacey brawl thing it's like a
thing right now so I really like that to
go along with the little lace trend also
this has a tag alright cuz I haven't
worn it yet
ignore that currently see it right now
but it has the lace in the front just
like the other shirt dos but it's just a
black crop top it goes higher up on the
side temesta see obviously in this video
but yeah goes high up on the sides which
I really really like it's not just basic
crop top so the next thing I want to
show you guys is all from a Lulu
so I really first of all this sweater if
you guys are wondering is from will
loose and I don't know if you guys can
tell but it's like grey but it's almost
teal color I
like this so this would be the first
item from Lulu's I wore this today and I
just want to take it off as it's so
frickin comfortable like seriously
because I'm like literally gonna sleep
in this you're not really under stress
but you know oh okay
sound of jack box of little loose stuff
so the first thing I'm showing you guys
is this white little crop top and it's
also lace and I'm telling you guys
you're going to see a lot of lacy like
tie up things in this video so this is
just a little lace crop top it has some
detailing on the sleeves you know give a
little yeah okay so that's this I really
really like that and a lot of these
clothes are also very summery because
it's getting out of like winter right
now
spring summer here we go the next top I
am obsessed with guys this is oh my gosh
it's literally perfect so it is this
blue crop top and this I seriously think
it's going to be perfect for summer when
I want to just like you go the beach or
not that we have like a really awesome
Beach here in Texas but if I want to go
Beach I want to go out I want to just
like be outside this is good because
it's super like breezy the sleeves are
big and like floppy also has the tie a
little lace thingy in the front which i
think is perfect so I love that and then
to kind of go with the whole like
tie-dye like feel life you know this is
summary tie-dye is like a summer thing
and I have been so obsessed with
sweaters I mean I still got a sweater
for moves but you know I've been so
obsessed with sweaters that I needed
some other stuff so I got this dress
it's really long because she was gonna
see it in the video so I mean pulling it
up but it's just a tie-dyed dress the
back is open its strappy it's really
cute also I think what I like most is
like I can tie this up so it's not like
a big long back seat I can like kind of
tie it up in the front make a little
shorter EQ okay so this next dress is
also like a purpley I don't know it's
like if the top almost looks like a
mussel tank but it's not
and it's really cute because it goes all
the way long like all the way down to
your ankles but it has a slit up the
side which I really like and the fitting
of this is not too too tight but it's
just perfect so it like shows your body
pretty nicely I don't know I think it's
flattering and I really really like the
color because I don't have a lot of
things in like purple so yeah I figured
I would like this
the next thing is a maxi skirt thing so
this is just like a really really pretty
floral print fabric but it's also very
very light and breezy and it goes up
really high waist it's like uh more like
a cute little crop top with it I'm like
maybe someone booties and well sandals
whatever you want to wear I don't know I
just like this it's also good for like
at church and like stuff like that it's
cute it's not ugly like I don't think it
looks like a curtain some of you guys
might not like this but it's probably
one of my favorite things I picked out
from Lulu's that I got and seriously and
the last thing from Lowe's is this skirt
and you guys know I really really like
these because I have this in maroon from
brandy melville and in like the mustard
yellow from brandy melville so when I
saw this I was like I'm barn it this is
so cute so I just I love this got some
low you know some buttons down Freddie
Kumar with a nice little crop top I
don't know I'm not a lot of people have
this color so I thought it was cute
about this but this is my newest
obsession this is probably my favorite
thing from Lulu I can't even show you
guys right now cuz I have a freaking
turtleneck on but it's those they're
they're such a thing right now guys it's
the little chokers you like you can like
basically make into I don't know I can't
I can't do it I can't I just can't do it
around but it's basically like this
little choker but you can make it
however you want to make it so I really
like this time for the Sailor day and I
was just like making little designs
within it on my neck so
so if you guys want to check out any of
the clothes I have everything as always
like below so all the stuff remove loose
I will leave link down below absolutely
love lives it's such a nice quality of
all of these clothes I'm so excited
towards not you guys are gonna obviously

they're such Instagram where the
clothing especially like the skirt and
I'm just excited guys I'm just excited
so go check out Lulu's I'll leave
everything down below the next thing I'm
showing you guys actually a new brand
that I have fallen in love with and they
didn't add so I'm just finding out I'm
telling you they do not tell me to say
this I really genuinely love this so
these aren't jeans I got so many
compliments on the one I wore them out
so these jeans are from revised and they
have these little I don't know they have
this cool detailing you read about the
knee and they have all these little like
distress parts them I don't know I think
it's so cute and perfect and they fit me
so well I'm telling you guys my butt
looks really good in these and it's just
the jeans it's just so in jeans look
because I know I don't have but it's
definitely just jeans and then I also
they have really really cute like
graphic tees kind of so you guys know
I'm like a sucker for like going through
shopping and find it like cute little
like out of a shirt so I can just make a
cute so this one has a little cactus on
it on and the back it has a social
circle thing cactus or whatever I think
it's really really cute and I think I
can dress it up a little bit wear it
with these jeans a skirt maybe stuff
like that so I really really like this
okay moving on to like a random
assortment of things so the first pair
are these shoes and these are by Michael
Kors so I bought these I bought these on
Christmas guys I bought these at 12
o'clock in the morning on Christmas and
I was like I shouldn't I bow to open
presents in a few hours
but like when I was how much shopping on
Christmas Day I was like these are
beautiful and they were on sale so I was
like yeah I need these so have this
little silver detailing on the side that
said Michael Kors and it's suede like
grey
I think they're really cute so I got
those the next thing are these black
pants and I always want to call them
Gauchos I don't even think we are like
considered Gauchos anymore they're just
like a like professional businesswoman
pant now I see people wearing them all
the time when I think of these I think
of like Tess Christine because she
always wears pants like this and she
looks so cute and then I was like
looking at pictures of someone I was
like those pants are really cute I want
to try them so I bought a black pair and
I think it's really cute like a cropped
sweater or a crop top or jacket
something like that with these you can
dress it up with yeah these are from
Zara and I bought them an extra small
you guys are wondering and then be
lasting from the random section this is
from Nordstrom and this is like a sway
grade t-shirt and you guys are quickly
why I do is buy a yellow t-shirt but if
you guys could feel this right now
it feels like a little baby sheep or
something I don't know I feel so good
its way in with euro and it's just I
don't know the brand is Madison and
Berkeley so that's really cute now so
about this in extra small and I find a
Nordstrom so I was just like I don't
know I thought it was cute and I buy and
it's cute to like wear with just jeans
because it is like a suede top such as a
t-shirt so it kind of dresses it up but
it was so special I guess now moving on
to triangle so yes I have some bathing
suits to show you guys and it's February
but I'm going to show you them anyway so
the first one I'll leave the name some
dumb books I don't know the names of
them but this is just this little floral
triangle top and now I'm not going to be
trying these on because that's
inappropriate but here we go
here's the top adorable and then the
bottoms are like what make it and no
obviously I haven't worn these the tags
are on them because it's not summertime
so this is just like a neon pink
blooming suit bottom then I have the
white top it's the same as the floor one
except just in white but the bottoms are
the floral pattern you get it so it's
kind of like like which one like you
know like what you gonna do are you
gonna put the flower with the flower
going to do like the white in the knee
yeah I'm moving on to the third one so
this one is a strapless white top and
this one I didn't know was kind of girl
look really good like up here you feel
me but it actually fits perfectly if you
guys want to know my sizes to these
because I know triangles so hard to
count the size I'm literally struggled
for longest I'm trying to out size it
was if you guys want to the size I will
tell you guys I'll link down below I'm
pretty sure I'm just a small and the top
large and the bottoms now doing them a
large in the bottoms I don't got a lot
down there but these are neoprene so
they don't stretch but with this white
strapless one I have this pink and like
mint floral bottom so those are all the
bathing suits from triangle and I'm so
excited to wear them because they're so
like trendy and people wear them and
stuff and I just thought they were cute
so love those now moving on to Urban
Outfitters I really did some damage and
everyone out fitters recently just
because it's Urban Outfitters and
everything that they have just completes
me it completes my style so I obviously
bought a little bra let this is a little
nude bra it it's I don't know I thought
I did it I need the bullets in every
color so slowly I'm buying them in every
color so some of you guys might hate
this next thing but I don't really care
so this is a floral dress it's super
super long it's a long look dressed I
don't know what's up with me a long
dresses right now but I like them and it
also has some lace in the front guys I'm
just I'm just in a mood I'm just in this
thing where I need the lace and I need
the long dress okay it's strappy I
thought that this would be cute for like
Easter or something I know I don't know
why I'm putting my outfits for Easter
but I thought it was pretty and if
you're going to buy something then like
give yourself a reason for it
so Easter here we come this beautiful
dress also closet no yellow is my
favorite color and flowers are the only
thing and
in the world I love my room my floors
right there another flower than right
there I have like four more vases of
flowers my room I love flowers so this
makes me happy
so the next thing is this plum slash I
don't even know yeah there's a tag on it
because haven't won a lot of these yet
because just bought them so give me some
time people this is a purple crop top
and plum maroon whatever it is ties and
think it's cute and cute prints summer
because it's sheer it's like boil over
like wear a tank top whatever you want
with this or you can dress it up wear it
with some high-waisted jeans
I don't know there's why you can do this
so and I think they have another colors
so then this is really basic but I like
army green so I just got this like
pocket tee from Urban Outfitters and
it's really really long it's longer in
the back than it is the front and what I
really like wearing this goes with is
like leather jeans and stuff like that
just to like give it a more edgy vibe
because it's like army greens leather
jeans you know it's a look so I love
this next I bought this little black
crop top and I know this looks extra
small but I promise it's really cute
with like high waisted leggings to make
it look more casual or highways jeans so
I love this it has a little pattern and
it also has lace and then the back is
like it's a little lacy I think it's
cute and this was on sale so I was like
why not and they also have it in white
so that's cute last clothing item Urban
Outfitters is this indeed it's just like
pullover it's just great it's as I do
just on the front and back it's really I
don't know I think it's cute to just
like look casual in put some like little
Nike shoes on some leggings throw this
on with a hat yeah speaking of hats I
have a half an eyeball and I totally
forgot about it I forgot about this but
I also want this at the same time as my
other stuff from Urban this is just like
a gray I don't even know it I said gray
didn't I it's a seafoam green hat and I
don't really have a lot of hats that are
like colors I have gray black um yeah
just gray and black so I would need a
colored hat and this
it's not too colorful for me so I like
it I think it's cute and I'm gonna be
wearing a lot of hats in the summer
because why not the last thing I have
from Urban is another pair of shoes and
these are New Balances and when I saw
these I was like can you haven't you
have to like I'm not I'm now collecting
shoes and it's a struggle but you know
what sometimes she's got to do it so
these are gray and like tannish nude and
they have a hint of baby pink and I love
it and I know I just showed you guys a
pair of gray suede shoes but these are
different okay they have a pink on them
so stop judge you need they have pink
and they're New Balances they're not
