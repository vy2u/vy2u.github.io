gonna start crying I Keaton you couldn't
change your shirt and pretend like this
was a different day no I give it it
because honestly I'm feeling myself
today I have this like outfit on that
I'm really digging and I like this shirt
with this makeup so just let me wear the
same shirt in two videos okay what's up
guys so today's video is going to be a
favorites video you already know what
this is I only have a few tangible items
that I'm actually showing you this month
the rest of my favorites are gonna be
like I'm just gonna talk to you about
them because they are mostly moments in
my life that have been my favorite and
like other things I just don't have
right here but first I'm gonna start
with beauty products so the first one is
this makeup forever primer and I have
been using ok ship I have been using the
like moisturizing primer most of the
time but the other day I started to use
the one that's kind of like for your
pores and mix your pores like invisible
and the more I start using it I normally
don't like like the pore fessional
everyone talks about that but I'm not
really into it because I didn't really
think like it worked that well and I
just don't really care about not showing
my pores but once I started using it I
was like this is the best thing ever not
the professional but the makeup for
everyone that um closes your pores and
stuff I forgot the name of it because it
says this weird name right here but I
will list it down below but that is been
my favorite so the next two things I
have had for like a while I just haven't
used them in this way so recently I have
gotten very very tan I'm more bronze and
I normally am and I have been using the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD invisible
covered foundation so I used two
different shades of these so this is I
don't even know I always think they're
like shade members are so weird I don't
ever know they're real shade numbers so
I'm gonna list them down below for you
guys but this is a light light light
shade because they sent me this they
sent me multiple shades
Sippi this one and this one is too light
for me and they sent me this one and
this one is too like orangie toned for
me so the other day I mix them together
and like boom a little like brush in it
oh my gosh this is the best coverage
number one and the perfect shape for me
when I mix these two together
I just really have been digging this
foundation a lot especially because in
the summer my skin tone is always
changing it's either like I'm tanning
all the time and I'm getting darker or
I'm really pale so this is like the
perfect coverage for me and it's super
liquidy which I really like I don't like
thick thick foundation which I just ran
out of my toothpaste foundation and it's
super thick but I love the coverage that
this gives me next I'm going to talk to
you about the Kylie cosmetics lipsticks
and this is the matte liquid lipstick
and lip butter and Dolce K and everyone
talks about these I know I'm either
gonna get like so much heat on this
video or everyone's gonna be like oh my
god you have them it doesn't never work
out but I really do love this Shane I
don't have a shade like this in any of
like any lipsticks that I have I do not
have a shade like this which is really
hard for me because I always tend to buy
the same nude shades all the time which
also if you're wondering I'm wearing
exposed by the Kylie cosmetics and it's
like my favorite news ever but oh my
gosh I do this in every video I always
drop something and throw it I'm just so
stupid anyway I love Dolce K and I've
been wearing this a lot more recently
and like in this past month even though
it's a dark shade that seems like you
would wear it in the fall I really like
to make it work for the know okay so my
next favorite said I want to talk to you
guys about are just like a moment in my
life and if you follow me on social
media you have seen them so some of my
favorite moments this month was prom
guys I went to prom it was so much fun
um I posted pictures on my Twitter I'll
post a picture on my dress here in case
you guys don't follow me this is my
dress it's by Sherri Hill and
they didn't send to me like I found it
and like bought it and like love it but
I am just I had such a good time at prom
I also graduated from high school this
month which is just crazy like it blows
my mind like I'm not in high school what
what are you doing well um it's just
it's crazy to me so I graduated in high
school this month also another thing
that has been super special this month I
can't remember if it was actually this
month or it was last month I kinda
forgot but I want to mention it here is
I had a subscriber send me a package in
my PO Box like see shout out to you
you're the freakin bomb for sending me
like amazing stuff she said me like this
mascara that I used the other day and
it's so good and she just is like
amazing so if you guys ever like one of
I don't even know like send me a letter
in my peel box I always have that listed
down below in the description bar so you
guys can do that and I like just it
makes my heart's so happy that I got
like a pill box like package this month
it was just the best thing ever
also another favorite is peonies so
these are really massive and like
sprouting out everywhere but I love
peonies I always have but I never have
been able to like go buy them but my mom
found some at Trader Joe's the other day
and she brought them home and I was like
this is the best day of my life you guys

tweet is like about flowers you can you
know there's a bus outside next I want
to talk to you guys about music because

music I wish I could sing I'm tone-deaf
but I'm very into music so if you guys

playlist every month so my may favorites

just I'll repeat I know like every word
no I just I don't know what's wrong with
you but that's all I have listened to I
would name a few of my favorite songs
but it's basically every single song in
the album the other the only other like
artists that I'm listening to right now
