to be at my may favorites so this is
going to be the makeup and beauty and
just like a bunch of different things
like that combines into one if you guys
are new to my channel I actually
normally make music but I just did a
music of the month video that's going to
be a new series on my channel of me just
singing in the car along with my
favorite music of the month so if you
guys haven't seen that video I will link
it down below guys can go click that or
I'll put info bar right here you guys
can watch it it's actually really really
fun so anyway I know that let's get into
the product so I'll be enough I have a
lot of Tarte products because I just got
a package from them and I didn't realize
all the new stuff that they had come out
with so the first thing that Tarte came
out with is see it glow with the faux
that one is yeah so it's basically a
foaming self-tanner it comes with a
really cute caning mitt and it's just a
really cute packaging in general but it
is an amazing self-tanner I used it on
my legs the other day when I was going
somewhere and I was like wait this is so
dark and so natural and I worked so so
well
oh no let me get this sound off here
anyway I just thought I would mention it
because it's actually a really really
amazing self-tanner I also you loving TN
self-tanner and like they're almost the
same thing that's not darker the sides
dirty but anyway this is an amazing
self-tanner I thought oh so and you
think that was from Tarte the other
things I'm tired that I thought was like
so weird and so understand is a hair
gold
dry shampoo that's called hair goals and
it is so good it literally smell like it
smells so good I am so good it smells so
good and I brought it on to playlist
with me and Tori Stirling like usage but
what car tubs dry shampoo it's actually
a really really good dry shampoo and I
really really like it so I've been using
this all must because washing your hair
is for losers like who washes their hair
the last product from chart is this
setting fray this is the rainforest of
DC like setting spray and the reason I
love this is because it smells so good
it smells like lime and like the ocean
and it's loot I want to spray it but I
don't get it maybe I'll set my face
again Oh
anyway this is an amazing setting spray
as you guys are new to my channel I
literally have like 15 setting stories I
don't know why I love settings for it so
much but this one's really good and I
just like to switch them up so different
scents are always a plus for me
the next thing is a foundation I'm
actually wearing it today and you guys
are going to pick what this is a
Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating tint
foundation I am in the shade nude at 40
right now which because I don't have a
spray tan on this is a really really
light color for me but I actually love
this for like an everyday use obviously
not going to be like a Make Up For Ever
HD foundation but this is a really
really good foundation for like everyday
wear I absolutely love it I'm wearing at
the past few days because I got it in
like a really really light shade because
I don't have this break in and I was
just like I should just try this out and
I love the applicator because I can just
dot it wherever that's why I find it
more for everyday yeah just really
really easy to just pick the spots you
want more coverage on you don't have to
like coat your whole face and foundation
like heavily so I'm going to love this
these next few things are lip products
and these are probably by far like my
favorite out of everything in this
favorites video just because I was so
impressed so these are by Maybelline
this would be maybelline vivid hot
lacquer and I've been posting a lot of
pictures lately and like I've had gloves
and everything it's raining outside the
windows to my car are open like all the
windows my car is getting soaked right
now moving on I guess I'll go fix that
later so these are the vivid hot lacquer
so I have the shades let's see
62 and 64 which they are so pigmented
like I wish you guys like I'm going to
swatch one of them this is what is
sister
is unreal like let me just do one are
you joking is this a joke and it's
glossy and oh my god it stays on for so
long this is in the shade 62 this is a
whiter light pink your one the other
ones super brown oh you've got to be
kidding me guys they're so so pretty I
was so impressed because I'm really
obsessed with glossy lips right now
obviously I have lost my lips right now
and these day for so long and they make
my lips look so much bigger than they
actually are because I'm a catfish we've
already discussed this the next day is a
perfume and I love perfume I love
everything obviously everything I'm
mentioning like I love it I just love it
I've been talking about it but this is a
Estee Lauder bronze goddess and I love
this because it smells
oh my god it's literally pouring outside
guys because it's soaking my car right
now oh god I'm going to have to solve it
you know my car was literally about to
flood I just want you guys to know but
we're gonna have to deal with it anyway
I was talking about this perfume it is
bronze goddess by sa water and it smells
amazing I'm spraying everything in this
video but it smells like the beach I
feel like it almost smells like tanning
lotion that's so weird like tanning oils
that makes sense it just smells so so
good and for some reason I like smell
changing oils
I don't know but it also has like some
more scale like it doesn't just stuff
like not like banana boat I promise okay
so the next few things a bit obsessed
with this month are obviously headbands
I'm wearing this one right now so all
three of these are actually from four
people I've been wearing them in like my
blog so everyone's wearing this one and
they're all them three people so I
actually love for people happy I've had
these for quite a while so I hope they
have views anymore but I just recently
was like into wearing them again so I
bought both of these and I was just like
well I just want to try and make them
trendy again I don't know why so I got
this red one like two days ago and it
also got these sunglasses from Free
People
can we talk about how bougie they were
like they're so cute though guys
so cute anyway I just want to quickly
mention these items I've been loving
headbands and then I just bought these
sunglasses that I love them so whatever
okay so the last thing is a necklace I
could honestly just be wearing this
right now but I took it off because I
was wearing it every single day
but it says Kiki on it which is like
muscle my little cousins call me like
some people want the only call me Kiki a
lot of you guys sometimes will call me
that
there's just like a nickname that I have
and this is from the M jewelers online
and I got this at beautycon they were
giving them away and I was like oh my
gosh I actually need one of these so I
got this one I want a lot more jewelry
but I just think this is really perfect
for everyday jewelry because I never
have like a necklace that I wear
everyday and now that I got this one I'm
like this is so cute so a lot of you
guys are asking where I got my like name
necklace from and I got it from in
jewelers so that is everything that I
have for this month's favorites if you
guys are wanting to see my music
favorites which a lot of you guys always
request I have a full new series which
is my music of the month series it's
really really fun and if you get 4000
likes I'm going to keep doing more of
them so you guys should definitely go
watch that if you guys aren't following
me on any of my other social media I
highly suggest I'm super active on
Instagram and Twitter and everything
like that so thank you guys so much for
watching this video and I will see you
guys next week okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
