don't know why we're just so tired like
never done that before
so how we're gonna go to breakfast
everyone's already there right it's all
good
we're gonna go get coffee now and do
something later there's a volleyball
game going on by the way I forgot to
mention oh I did mention about my camera
being lost and so I don't have the
footage from day two so like you're
watching these vlogs but I did skip a
day because it's my camera and I don't
have the footage for it anymore so I'm
using someone else's camera I've been
using someone else's camera we're gonna
get coffee and watch a volleyball game
earlier we left the camp with all the
kids and it was so sad
sabrina is not at the same camp as us
but she does sports and we don't so like
we do separate things but it was sad and
fun how you feelin Hannah it's windy
what flavor Nutella
coconut nothing she got coffee
good
I'm foggy with my phone because as usual
technical difficulties
I was playing volleyball yesterday and
another guy had a GoPro and they're both
sitting on the bench and then I picked
up his GoPro instead of my GoPro or not
even my GoPro the GoPro I was borrowing
and I vlogged with it and then he was
like oh hey that's my GoPro later on so
I gave it back but then I gave the GoPro
that had the footage on it to someone to
like get the footage on that computer I
don't know it's really confusing but
basically I don't have a GoPro right now
and I look like a dead animal
but I'm vlogging with my phone and now
could it GoPro later maybe we'll see
I might just blog the rest of the trip
on my phone actually honey from me don't
you know honey
oh yeah I'm more dressed for church
I really want to take it home adopted
Dominican dog
we're at with lunch I almost at dinner
Bret lunch there's Claire Sabrina
Hanna our lunches rice and bread me
eatin I don't know what we're doing now
I'm really tired I don't know if they're
tired yeah Anna wants to take a nap I
think I need to take a nap Sabrina's
always down to party so so she might be
napping as well I don't know we don't
know but I'll walk whatever we do after
that because yeah
we're going to play volleyball
okay so we're only gonna play for a
little bit because we have dinner at
6:30 but we'll probably leave the
volleyball court at 7:00 so loud I'm in
the lobby
we have story time earlier and all that
kind of stuff we chitchat we dance a
little bit you know we're gonna go to
sleep now and then we're going to be
just hanging out tomorrow tomorrow's our
free day because we leave the next day I
really don't know how this vlog is
looking right now because I wish you
could see the trouble that I'm having
with getting all this footage in one
place and I'm like lost my GoPro with
footage on it this week my computer is
broken so I can't edit so all the
footage that I'm recording I put on
someone else's computer and then I have
to get it back later it's just really
confusing so I'm just gonna be finishing
all the rest of these vlogs on my camera
and I'm really sorry that it's I mean on
my phone camera I'm really sorry that
it's pretty crappy but this is just what
I got to do you know okay yeah okay
