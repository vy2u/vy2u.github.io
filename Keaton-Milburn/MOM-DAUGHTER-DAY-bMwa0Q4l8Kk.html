been trying to blog a lot more lately
because you guys really like when I've
lost my grandfather sandals though you
guys are asking me on my main server
logs go subscribe to my vlog channel
because that's why froze logs
anyway me my mom are getting breakfast
right now she's in Arizona visit me on a
little trip so that's what we're doing
right now my mom picked this place out
and it's very cute but the restaurant
we're eating at on the farm is called
Morning Glory but it has like chickens
and animals and cute little shops it's
really really cute but we're doing pay
but we got I got potatoes I get some
gravy and baking and my mom got her
yogurt parfait she gives every single
dime but this looks so good there's a
really cute is it like what is it what
would you describe it because it's not
just cake it's like a bakery it's like a
bakery but they have like
chocolate-covered pretzels and like
Oreos and stuff like that at this place
and it's really cute and my mom just
always wanted to go and it's in
Scottsdale so we're going to Ruth's
Cakery Bakery
okay go you go okay anyway so we're
going to this Cakery and we're going to
get okay shall I go in here so forth
this is too much guys look how queue
wait stop mom
this is the cutest thing mom disappoint
me me and look at these sugars here
these are pepper me and my mama things
you cookies and Internet for you and
they're so good I've had you supporters
laughing we got our sweet I also got
some strawberry matcha just really good
my mom doesn't like it she doesn't like
the texture of boba is it like freaks
her out so I like it though guys I'm on
focus my haircut car so I'm good to cook
yes this is the best cookie I've ever
have lemon and lavender it's all good I
love anything lavender but me and my mom
are at Target or appliance target right
now to go get a few things and I think
we're going to go to dinner later on
tonight I need to shut you up to this
face is mine and probably change can I
change before we go somewhere - yes
clausura doing because you're just kind
of target for lifting you end up picking
out 700 random things that you just put
your ad target so you do need them these
are so good I don't know why I need
these right now but there's just in the
vanilla almond butter these are so bomb
and I like to have them in the morning
so I'm going to get these I also have an
addiction to these right now they're on
the nut then nut and rice
they're super bland but when I'm like
super hungry I want snack better than
eating chocolate what I normally do I
literally just that instead of snacking
on chocolate I'm getting that Vince but
I also just picked up these and there's
our chocolate pretzels but I like these
and they're good and I got some gum okay
so because my mom used to literally we
need to talk about what you used to do
mom my mom used to literally for
probably her entire life only watch her
face was just straight-up water so she
would wear like all this makeup and then
should only wash your face with water
and just do nothing and I don't
understand how people do that because I
cannot go to sleep that washing my face
and like putting moisturizer on so I'm
getting this hydraboost hydrating
cleansing gel and this is from
Neutrogena so I'm getting is this and
this is also the hydraboost
hydrating serum so both of these are
hydrating which my mom needs because
that's the loader has been in my last
couple years
getting better at it but what really
like forever
ever since I light it started giving her
like different skin care of things and
like getting her into it she's like I
used to just use like water what do I
need water was just like anyways you
should take off her makeup and lotion I
understand the concept
so those and because it's always
complaining about her wrinkles her neck
her neck is her pet peeve or wrinkle
really is
and literally it's hurt like I wear the
embers or whatever as necklaces are
frankly nested oh I'm getting busy
Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair and if
you actually get three at these new
creative products you get a free five
dollar gift card actually at Target so
that's what I'm getting right now
in these three so I'm also giving this
positively radiant
overnight hydrating facial moisturizer
48 hour hydration and basically just put
this on when you go to sleep which I
really like these these are like my
favorite kind and the wild Stevens mask
on they also have the new positively
radiant 62nd in shower facial which if
you get one of these or both of these
you can get five percent off with the
cartwheel app the target card well you
can also do the same thing with clean
and clear they have two new products
which are the acne triple clear
exfoliating scrub and they also have the
acne triple clear a bubble foam cleanser
so both of those you can also save 5%
off if you have the cartwheel out
opportunely time Annamacharya we open
the food that we're going to buy before
we actually buy it and we eat it all and
then we just pay for the empty box so
next thing i'm our chicken trout is the
hydraboost hydrating concealer and this
is actually really cool because one you
guys know a lot about dry skin I'm
always talks about hydrating my skin and
so to have a concealer that is
refreshing my skin and like replenishing
it while I'm also concealing is super
cool so I'm getting this in a light 20
mom look at this book this is look at
this book it's a farce look it's time to
walk around the store maybe one thing is
that's a good mom the title is going to
be like mom parts intact
clickbait would be like my mom's farting
and target
that one is crazy look at you
that was crazy
guys we just weren't your babies music
did you see that as well is there like a
person no one in their right I think it
looks wrong roll back or something it's
right here acting that spot and language
right yeah not always oh the King does
when I lie ahead guys there was a
parking there was a car parked right
here and it just literally started
rolling backwards down the parking
garage like literally like no one was in
the car the car just started rolling
backwards
I guess because this is added plan and
in my head in like in neutral yeah they
must not but I don't know but it doesn't
have reverb sinks in fact is not bought
with music well I know but it literally
just started rolling down the park line
and hit another truck and this is there
and like no look at the car see it
rolled backwards into this other truck
and now there it is put it okay guys I
got a buffalo chicken
like crap I think rollin on wrap Susie
roll which is like really I don't know
I'm going on my Cromford done here

use those of the Aveeno positively
radiant
overnight hydrating facial and it smells
really good smells like so it's all
mm-hmm it smells good and she's going to
use which one and you see well because
of my wrinkly neck as you guys heard her
hair when I use nitrogen a rapid wrinkle
repair and it says results within one
week so we look at a hammer and call
they were smooth and even layer over the
entire quince paste two to three times
per week instead of a night cream to
wake up to deeply hydrated radiant skin
there we go it's just me feeling fresh
