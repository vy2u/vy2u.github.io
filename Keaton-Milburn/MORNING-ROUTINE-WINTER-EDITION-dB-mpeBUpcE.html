sleeping in my bed with all of my
stuffed animals and if you haven't seen
my room this is my room and then later
on once I'm woken up my dog will come in
and she's insane so there she is
after I wake up I normally get right on
my computer and I will either go on
YouTube and reply to you guys comments
or I will get on my tumblr and reply to
more questions on there
after that I'll head to the restroom but
I can't forget to put my fuzzy socks on
so shout out to Blair for buying me
these amazing socks that look like my
dog so I start by washing my face so
first I'm gonna pull my hair back so it
doesn't get all wet
even though somehow I always managed to
still get it wet once I pull it back but
then I turn the water on to make sure
it's warmed up because I do not like
washing my face with cold water then
I'll use my favorite scrub in the world
my st. Ives apricot scrub and I'm just
using that all over my face and it kind
of exfoliates it and gets off all the
dead skin
so if you guys didn't know I do not
actually use makeup wipes but after I
wash my face I use Huggies non-scented
wipes take off any excess I don't know
makeup that might be left there and I
feel these work the best that's why I've
stuck with them and then I use my
dragon's natural glow moisturizer to
just moisturize my face and like around
my neck just because I get spray tan so
it's harder then I will just take my
hair out of its little button in head
downstairs
this man
next I'm heading over to my Keurig and
I'm going to grab a mug and make some
coffee for the morning
in case you guys were wondering this is
the coffee that I use that morning and
this is our Keurig
and of course I filled the coffee mug up
way too much so I'm going to go dump a
little bit out in the sink and then I'm
going to hand over to the fridge where
I'm grabbing peppermint mocha creamer
just because it's like Christmassy I
guess and then some milk these Christmas
how much fun next I'm going on to make
my breakfast which I have every single
morning I am having the Quaker maple and
brown sugar oatmeal and I grab some
honey and I'm just adding that into a
bowl with water and I am that person
that actually uses the packet to fill it
up with water and then pour it back in
the bowl
so I will put that in the microwave for
about a minute and 30 seconds and then
once that's done I will take it out in
stir it just make sure it's all mixed
together and add my honey
this Christmas and once you trim a J how
much fun is gonna be the game because
I'm also OCD I set a timer for seven
minutes and then I take my oatmeal and I
put it in the fridge because I do not
like eating it hot so I leave it in
there to cool for about seven minutes
and then while that cools I'll head to
the breakfast table and just talk to my
mom and my stepfather
lessons and females will still use these
after I take my oatmeal out of the
fridge I'm gonna grab some blueberries I
originally wanted raspberries which I
normally have with this but I got
blueberries so I'm just gonna run some
on my hand and make sure they're cleaned
off and then just pour mint my oatmeal
yeah
sugar is bad
after breakfast I will head back
upstairs and because I am also again OCD
I'll make my bed up and make sure that
my homeroom is clean and neat and then
probably a lighted candle just so it
smells festive in my room
this Christmas so I'm gonna be showing
you guys a little makeup tutorial that's
kind of like no makeup makeup I don't
normally wear makeup on like lazy days
like this but I figured I would show you
guys just in case you guys need to go
out on lazy days anything like that so
I'm going to be showing you guys that
first step is to grab my Laura Mercier
concealer and I will just put that
underneath my eyes to highlight and then
under anywhere else
I'm eliminate it and then I'm going to
take a blending brush it's kind of like
a foundation brush and I'm just going to
blend that out next I take my Laura
Mercier powder and I put that all over
my face I don't use a lot of this just
because I'm trying not to look cakey or
anything and then I take my Tarte
bronzer and I contour because I cannot
go anywhere without contouring ever and
then I'm going to take my benefit speed
brow and just make sure my eyebrows are
in line and then I'm just taking a OS
chapstick and using that next I use my
Naked palette and I just use really nude
color on my eyes just to give definition
and then I use Sephora brand mascara
just because I'm not really looking for
long lashes last I will go in with a
black eyeliner and I will just line my
lower lash line it's the most beautiful
Samedi rise for the street spread today
I decided to pull half of my hair up
just because I wanted it out of my face
while I'm walking around and stuff and
then I'm going to brush my teeth so I
grabbed my crest white toothpaste and my
toothbrush face I should be playing in
the winter snow
imma be under the mistletoe I just
bought this lipgloss from pink which I
never wear lip gloss but I'm kind of
obsessed with it so I decided to put it
on today it tastes really good actually
and it has a really nice pink color
next I have picked out my outfit so I'm
going to lay that out on my bed and then
obviously Jamil has to stop filming so I
can change and thank you Landon for
buying me these shoes from Nike and then
the rest of my outfit is basically a
oversized big t-shirt from Zara I'm
wearing Lululemon leggings and my outfit
isn't that cute but it's super casual so
I just wanted to be comfortable after
that I will feed my fish and then I am
ready to go so that is my whole morning
routine I hope you guys enjoyed this
comment below if you guys want to see a
nighttime routine and comment any other
ideas you have for me below thank you

you all next week bye that's a Merry
Merry Christmas it's the most beautiful
