but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys today's video is going to
be my music of the month for February if
you guys are new to my channel and this
is the first music of the month you guys
are seeing you guys can go watch all the
other ones I do these every month and if
you guys are new here and this is your
first video of mine don't forget to
subscribe I would love to have you guys
and my little family as always all the
music I'm gonna be playing this video is
going to be listed in the downbar I have
a Spotify playlist I make every single
month I also made another playlist this
month it's called feels and it's
probably my favorite playlist that I've
made I don't know why I just like it so
much I'm not gonna play songs from those
because there's like hundreds of songs
in that one but it's actually a really
good place if you guys are looking for
like slower music I don't know it's just
like it's different and when you listen
to it you'll understand but this is
going to be my February favorites
playlist so let's just get into it okay
so this song is super old but for some
reason this month I've been listening to
it so much so I'm gonna include it
anyway it is by Maggie Winton I know she
also does social media so that's really
cool but this song it's just really like
funny like I don't know this lyric so
funny to me so I really like it
why
next song is by Warren Toronto and
actually really liked it I randomly saw
this music video for it on my home page
of YouTube and it's the acoustic version
I guess she has like a normal version
not acoustic but I like the acoustic
version of this called so cool and she's
like a social influencer in sub-2 so I
thought that was really cool so I don't
know why I'm so obsessed with the song
right now
my baby
so that is it for my February music of
the month I hope you guys liked it I
know it's not a lot of songs this month
I definitely think you guys should check
out the fields play this away because I
feel like I've been listening to that a
lot more than I haven't listening to my
February favorites this month so if you
guys actually want to drive with me to
that playlist that would actually
probably be important interestings it's
a lot better but thank you guys so so
much for watching this video if you guys
liked it you guys want me to keep doing
these every month don't forget this
video a big thumbs up was that English
I just slurring 17 different words and
like one sentence new to this channel
don't forget to subscribe because it
would mean so so much to me and yeah I
will see you guys next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
