spiel but if you guys like me you guys
go follow me on Instagram and Twitter
as you guys know I'm just gonna be
listening to my favorite songs of this
month I am gonna include a lot of songs
from December because I didn't do any
summer music of the month so I'm gonna
just mix them all together I have a
Spotify playlist that you guys can go to
in every single month I make the
playlist of all the songs I listen to
this one has like nine songs and at my
January one because my December one has
35 so I'm just gonna be mixing them
together because they were just like all
over the place but if you guys want you
guys to go follow my Spotify and check
out the music so you guys have it for
yourselves my hair is so faded like it's
like gray and purple and just a lot of
different colors right now but I'm
trying to grow my roots out that's why
they're hella long right now so just
don't mind that I look like a crack it
you bottle girl
okay I found this next girl because I
found her on Instagram and then she had
this like Twitter video that would like
kind of viral it was like so cute and so
I found her and then she made this song
called
I see girl her name is sweetie she's so
cute and this song just makes you want
to like go out and like stud you know
what I'm saying like if you're with all
your friends and y'all are about to like
go out somewhere like you're about to
see someone that you know you don't like
like listen to this song before you go
and you'll just be like 100% can't stop
won't stop give up my toes no choice
that stop many kids and petty kids I'm
always hit up on anything I'm not hot
all these lies they despise cuz I'm
feisty feisty haters wanna fight me
I just had to let you know
she said do you love me I tell her only
partly I only love my bed my mom oh my
god I just love drink so much like it's
salt it's literally impossible to hate
him like how do you eat it how do you
not like I told ya you know me and this
is not a music of the month without Big
Sean so let's just get into his album
because I didn't get to do a December
and I just listened to his album all of
December so we're gonna play it now
when you go to work in many shows
now I'm going to play the honcho Jack
album it is so good I literally listen
to this album on repeat all day every
day so I don't know how I'm gonna pick
like what songs I want to play but I'll
just
because Pia Mia also came out with an EP
in December and it's so good you guys
know me and I love Pia Mia I listened to
her music all the time and I just think
she's so talented and I don't think
enough people really listen to her so
I'm gonna put the epp you guys
okay so to end this video I'm going to
end it on a weird note but not really
that weird if you guys haven't seen the
greatest show man I am recommending that
movie to literally everybody it is such
a good movie like I don't know what I
was expecting but I was not expecting
what I got it was an amazing movie like
I was so shocked so if you guys haven't
seen the greatest showmen go watch it
I'm going to play a song from the
soundtrack because the music wasn't
legit so good that I added like some of
the soundtrack into my playlist and I
never add like musical soundtracks into
my plans so that just says that like
it's a really good song oh I'm gonna cry
cry
if that song did not make you feel some
type of way I you have no emotions like
you have no heart I literally love that
song so much I don't know why I let me
 goosebumps I think it's also
because I saw the movie and I also watch
like a bunch behind the scenes Club so
I'm just like obsessed with the
characters and everything so I'm just
like super attached to them alrighty
guys so that is it for my January music
of the month I hope you all liked it if
