you guys don't know I have a Spotify
playlist every single month that you
guys want to hear some of the songs

songs that are in the playlist in the
music of the month video because I want
you guys to look at what the references
would be so anyways let's just put the
Sun shelf

dog I just want to preface the fact that
I am a huge Jimmy Livanos fan like I
think her voice is one of like I think
she's so challenged I think her voice is
one of those like unique amazing voices
ever like such a random fact but I've
always looked I used to buy all our CDs
during her like Disney Channel like
la-la-land phase like I had all overseas

want you guys to know that I'm really
excited that she came out with a song
and actually love this
