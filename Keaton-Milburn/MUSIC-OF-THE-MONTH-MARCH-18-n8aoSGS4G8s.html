original it's an older song but I just
discovered it and then like two days
after I discovered the song the figures
a reprise came out with Daniel Caesar

Caesar I love him so I was like oh my
god I'm obsessed with the song and the
fact that he just released this and it's
so good so I'm gonna sing this for you

okay we're gonna get like super emo here
quickly
but I haven't obsessed with Georgia

in love with I don't know why I'm also
so excited I get to see her I Coachella

obsessed with this month so I'm gonna
play like a few songs but I think I only
have two on my playlist but I added a
bunch of my feels playlist so yeah
