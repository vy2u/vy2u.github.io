to be a obviously music of the month
video so this is a new series that I
have started on my channel this is your
first time watching one of my videos I
normally in every monthly favorites feel
will mention beauty products makeup hair
and then at the end of my favorites
videos I'll always mentioned music but I
felt like I was getting really really
boring of me just naming songs that I
liked of the month so I decided that I
wanted to start like driving around in
my car and just singing my favorite
songs of the month and just let me you
guys actually hear them instead of just
reading the names you guys and you going
and listening to them you guys can
actually hear part of them and see if
you like them which a lot of you guys
really really do like my music for some
reasons and you're like for years you
have to do this so I'm thinking about
actually bringing someone else in the
car with me I'm possibly going to bring
one of my good friends Colleen in the
car lines guys here my vlog so you guys
want another person in the car with me
like jamming to music give this video a
thumbs up I want to try and get it to
like 4,000 likes maybe I don't know
we'll see but if it gets 4000 likes I
will bring another person in the car
with me well Jam will drag around we'll
go get food stuff like that if you guys
like this this is definitely just like a
tester to see if you guys are like about
this you know hold music of the month
thing in the car I've never been out of
my car so this is really so weird to me
let's get started also this camera is
literally so shaky and I don't know how
to get it to just like sit like I don't
understand like a tripod I bought for it
it's like not working so we're just not
to deal with that
baby crying my friend when I went past
yo like chi2 sled
guess I'm a bad liar okay we're getting
into tiller let's just tie the hair up
because I'm about to I met to lose my
mind my soul is
behind me alrighty guys so that is my
favorite music of the month I feel like
this is definitely a very trial and
error video I definitely want a new
tripod for this camera because I know
the footage is going to be super bumpy
that's because every tiny move that's my
card makes the camera move some
definitely going to get a new tripod to
stabilize that and yeah anyway enough of
me laughing if you guys really really
did like this video comment down below
and give it a lot of thumbs up if you
guys want to see someone else in the
video with me don't forget to follow me
on all my social media and again I will
be listing my Spotify playlist of all of
my musics down below if you guys aren't
yet subscribed you might want to do that
because my monthly favorites will be
coming out in like a few days and it's
gonna be my beauty products my makeup
all that kind of stuff so I hope you
guys like this video and I was using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
