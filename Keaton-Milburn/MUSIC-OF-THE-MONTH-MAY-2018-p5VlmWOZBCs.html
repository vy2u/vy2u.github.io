you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be of music of the month I'm so
excited oh my god I know I skipped the
last one so I'm really disappointed in
that but that just makes this video so
much better because I'm gonna be
combining all the music from last month
which is a lot and this month which is
also a lot so this is just gonna be one
long music of the month I hope you guys
are ready for it get some food get some
popcorn get a snack and a drink
and just sit down jam with me I'm
actually starving I haven't eaten all
day it's only 11:20 in the morning so
I'm gonna go to Starbucks because I
might actually pass out during this
video if I don't get it snack I haven't
talked to you guys in so long how are
you I love Kalani like any song that
she's on I'm there I'm really I'm right
there next to a girl
guys I haven't been here in so long that
we never got to discuss cardi B's album
like now I feel like oh my god everyone
knows that and like the songs are all
poppin but like we never got to discuss
them so I'm gonna play a few from the
album I'm not gonna play all the ones I
like because it's like we need to move
on to current things but we never got to
discuss it so let me just start with the
ultimate
okay hold up we're at Starbucks I'm not
even getting a drink I'm just hungry I'm
hangry huh
is it just me or does Starbucks serve
you their sandwiches like scorching hot
like literally fresh out the oven I mean
like I guess it's better it for it to be
hot than cool but like I can't eat this
for a good like 30 more minutes because
it's so hot I'm kind of upset about it
but whatever
let's talk about Fozzie I think that's
very seriously I don't know his name
let's talk about boss's new album
because you really like went off like he
really did every single song on that
album I love like I literally just
clicked the album added it to my April
favorites because I was like this is so
good
who else is so excited for our Gretna's
new album to come out I'll ever think
about it every single day I've heard
like tweet notifications on our Twitter
notifications on and she just sweets
about her new music and I'm like can you
give it to me because I don't know how
many of my subscribers are post Malone
fans I'm assuming a ton because who like
doesn't left post Malone but his new
album is amazing beer bongs and Bentley
as I believe yeah I didn't want to like
say the wrong beer bongs and Bentley's
so we're gonna listen to just a few
because honestly the whole album is
amazing and I've been listening to it
from like beginning to end on repeat but
it's so many songs that I'm not gonna do
it all so let's just do my favorites
so this is the last song from my April
favorites playlist this song like just
blew up I feel like everyone knows the
song I've seen all over Twitter and
everything but it's my last song for my
April favorites oh my god what did I
just hit it's my last song for my April
favorites oh my god what did I just hit
now moving on to May which is like not
even the current month but it is so as
you can tell I told you I have a lot of
music so to end this music of the month
I'm going to end it with Shawn Mendes
because I'm officially a Shawn Mendes
Stan like I literally stand him like
okay like he was cool before but now I'm
actually in love with him like I'm so
infatuated with this man I don't
understand his music is like my type of
music I added on to my field splitting
this you're welcome but I'm just gonna
play it so we can like all cry together
in this
I'm only gonna play what war Shawn
Mendes song and this is the last song
the video I'm only gonna play two
because if I do hope I'm not probably
like start crying and that's like not my
vibrator it's only ever meant to be for
one night still with changing
so that's it for this month's music of
the month I hope you guys liked it I
tried to pack as many songs in here as I
cut since I know I did miss month I'm so
sorry but I'm back I hope you guys like
this video if you guys did give it a big
thumbs up if you guys are new to my
channel and this is the first music of
the month our first video you're seeing
