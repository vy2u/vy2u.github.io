this is a love story I'm gonna play from
Denise new album but I mean her new
album is amazing but I played this song
for B rock and we were in the car like
crying so this is one to cry - I love
you Brian and I actually love her music
and she just recently came to Arizona
and I got to like I got to go to her
concert and see her perform and meet her
and she's super sweet and it was
literally like the most amazing concert
because her voice is so good it's insane

so the rest of this music of the month
is dedicated to Taylor Swift and before
