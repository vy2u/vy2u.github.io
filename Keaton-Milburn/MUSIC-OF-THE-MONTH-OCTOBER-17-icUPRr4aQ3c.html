to my October music of the month I don't
know why I always start off yelling but
I feel so weird that I haven't filmed
this I didn't film a music of the month
last month but get ready because I am in
love with these songs this month and I'm
so excited to share them with you also
the Sun is setting so if it starts
getting progressively darker in this
video I'm so sorry the Sun sets at like
5:30 in Arizona so it's great it's a
great life to live yeah let's just get
into it I'm gonna start driving it also
you guys know every month I have my
playlist on Spotify go follow me on
Spotify so that you guys can see the
playlist even before I make the YouTube
deal with all of my songs in a lot of
times I won't include every single song
on my playlist in this video I just want
to put a few the Sun is really messing
with my angle right now but if you do
want to see the songs you guys gonna
follow me on my Spotify I'm just going
to randomly shuffle them so here we go
there is an accident and there's a lot
of traffic and it's really throwing off
my vibe like I need to be going like 75
in order for me to be like full-on into
this so just give me a second
for some reason this is my favorite song
this month and Kelsey has heard it way
too many times it's unhealthy but i'ma
play it again so here we go
so you guys know my obsession with her I
am obsessed with her and she just came
out with a volume to b-sides like if you
were to like flip the tape it would be
like me sighs if that makes sense okay
anyway and it is so good her music it
just like makes my soul so happy so I'm
gonna play my favorite song from her new
releases
oh my god
it's all good you need to talk
all right so the rest of the drive with
me is now dedicated to Marquis Basie
I actually don't know how to say his
last name I have been listening to his
music since forever like when I say
forever I mean if you guys are like og
which most people are because no one
really cares about his music in the way
that I care about it
but I love him so much and I have a
listening to him since he was like 2
a.m. club which was like him and like
other people but now he's like a solo
artist and he's like super poppin and
like cool I honestly feel like he's so
on the come-up I swear it on my life
like if you guys watch this video tweet
him and be like she loves your music I
feel like he's such he's really he's
really on the come-up like he's been
popping but like I feel like this is
this is the year for him I truly do
without me talking about him anymore as
if I know him I'm just gonna dedicate
the rest of this drive with me to his
new album not release it's called gossip
Collins it is amazing it is the perfect
like top-down bumpin like perfect jam
music like I'm just gonna play it now so
does my brazen crush get this fucking
game
this might be my favorite song on the
album I don't know why it just might me
okay
because I didn't do a drive with me
September I'm gonna play two songs off
my September favorites playlist because
I still made a playlist I just didn't
film the video for it so I'm employed
two songs then we're gonna be dead okay
okay
so because I'm the best youtuber ever I
forgot to film an outro for this video
so if you guys liked it please give it a
big thumbs up I'm going to be linking
all of my playlists so you guys can get
all the music it's down below in
description like always follow me on
Instagram and Twitter because that is
where I am most active so thank you guys
