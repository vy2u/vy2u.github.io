to be a day to night time look and I've
never actually done a video like this
but I figured I would show you guys what
it's like for me when I have to get
ready for the day but I know at night I
want to have like a kind of different
look than just a regular like daytime
look so this is obviously my daytime
look I will be showing you guys how I
get to this nighttime look later on the
video but if you guys are new don't
forget to subscribe and yeah let's get
into the video so starting off obviously
yeah I have a spray tan and I don't stir
my face so it obviously doesn't match my
neck but I am priming with this hangover
up primer by Too Faced which this is the
first time I use it and I actually
really loved it and then this is
officially in holy grail this is the Mac
strobing liquid and gold light I think
and it just looks so pretty
underneath my foundation so speaking of
foundation I'm going in with the
hourglass stick foundation this is a
nice shade of beige which obviously I
know it looks insane but I promised once
this video is done I will look so normal
this is just the process okay so I am
just letting this out with my Sigma
brush and then I'm going to go in with
concealer today I'm going to be using
the urban decay concealer because yeah I
don't know that's just want to use I'm
using this in the shade fair which I
think this is a little bit light but it
really helped mix the foundation in with
my skin so I'm just putting this
underneath my eyes obviously and on my
forehead to brighten my face up a little
bit and blending this out with a Beauty
Blender now I'm going to go in with a
cream contour it's actually a foundation
this is the Lumi cushion in the shade c8
and I'm just using this to contour with
my Beauty Blender is super simple really
really easy and then I'm going to be
baking my face really really lightly on
my under eyes and my forehead and my
chin which those are the places that
seem to get to most oily so that's where
I normally a bake and so yeah I'm just
pressing that powder in and then moving
on I'm going to set the rest of my face
with this Maybelline powder I will leave
this shade down below I'm not exactly
sure but I just set the rest of my face
with this and then I'm going to be
filling in
my eyebrows really quickly so yeah
they're pretty pushy right now they need
major help but then I'm just setting
them with the an associate zip brow
actually that's not the dip brow that is
the clear brow gel and then I'm going in
with the color pop sand collection I
believe and this is like their new
collection that they have this is the
eyeshadow palette and actually love this
because neutral Browns are my thing so
kind of for a daytime look I like to
just put one simple crease color and
that is this light brown crease color
right here and I'm just putting this in
the crease to deepen it up and that's
honestly it I'm not going to add any
highlighting shades I'm not going to
make it really dark that's just really
easy for me so I'm adding this
Maybelline mascara on top of that I'm
not doing any liner normally for a
daytime look I don't really add eyeliner
I don't know why but I'm going really
slow here because you guys saw my other
video I got mascara all over my face
because I suck so now I'm using the Kat
Von D shade and light palette I'm mixing
these two shades the left and the right
length obviously the middle one fell out
so it's no longer an option for me but I
am lightly contouring my cheeks and then
I'm going to go in I use this just to
contour because at the darker shade but
then I'm going to go in and bronze my
face with hoola bronzer and the Smashbox
of starburst I believe it's what it's
called and this just helps me illuminate
my face as well as bronzes then I
realized I forgot I didn't have blush so
I went in with the shade kitty cat I
believe it's like a light or it's a pink
shade and I just used this as blush
because it's really pretty and a
highlight in it and then I also use glow
getter and then the white one on the far
left to highlight I'm not a huge
highlight fan so I didn't apply this
really heavily but I did just want a
little bit of glow so I added that and
then I'm going in with this glam glow
wet lip and this is just like a
chapstick basically it's what it feels
like it just feels really really good on
my lips moisturizes them and that is the
completed daytime look
so now for the night said look I am
pulling my hair back in a little bun and
if you guys are wondering how I got my
hair braided like this my answered it
for me I cannot help you guys just says
I cannot do it to myself but so normally
for the night time I want to add a
little bit more jewelry kind of dress up
whatever out but I was already wearing
during the day so I added two chokers
the top one is from forever 21 the
bottom one is from Urban Outfitters and
the earrings are from Topshop I just
added some hoops just because I like
them so I'm going to make the eye shadow
a bit darker just for nighttime so I'm
blending two really nude brown shades in
my crease I'm just blending those out
super super easy and then I'm going to
go in with de highlighting shade and I'm
going to put that underneath my brow
bone and on my inner corner and then to
deepen it up a little bit more I'm going
in with some a black eye liner and just
doing this on the top of my lashes and
I'm like what is that called tight line
tight lining my lashes I'm adding that
right there and then now for literally
the best part of this so this is the
glam glow plump rageous metallic lip
plumper treatment I seriously if you
like this completed the look I just
think it looks amazing so this is the
shade lusty which is just a really
pretty nude metallic I love this and so
I just twisted it and I pull the
applicator out it's so so pigmented so I
am applying this on my lips like you
guys can tell here it's just really
pretty good this also comes in two new
shades I am using lusty but it also
comes in suggestive which is a darker
metallic shade which is also really
pretty and the exact I've ever used any
of their lip plumper treatments you guys
know that these tingle and they make
your lips like so much bigger throughout
the night which i think is really
awesome because everyone's overlaying
their lips anyway so why not just get a
actual like metallic lip that does that
for you throughout the day so that is my
gross looks before and here's them after
because just look at the difference like
amazing
so guys this is the final look I think
the looks really complete the look I
love that there looks metallic and we
just make my lips feel some use which is
like my goal and literally every single
video of mine and it's loved it looks so
highlighted and metallic and really
pretty so if you guys are interested I
will leave everything linked down below
thank you to glam glow for sponsoring
this video I'm so excited to work with
this I think they look seriously
completed this entire look and it looks
amazing so if this like this video guys
want to see it more like this give it a
thumbs up and I will see you guys next
week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
