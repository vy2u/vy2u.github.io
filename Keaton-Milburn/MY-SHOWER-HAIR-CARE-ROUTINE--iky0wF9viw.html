to be my shower routine plus my hair
care routine and I decided to combine
these together because a lot of you guys
have been requesting a haircare routine
you guys always ask me like how does
your hair look so good you get it dyed
as so many questions about my hair all
the time so I decided to add my hair
care routine into my shower routine just
because that's just basically the
easiest way to show you guys what I
actually use in the shower and then also
when I use after I get out of the shower
so I wanted to talk about that there's
something my eye there's something in my
eye that's why I was just blinking so
much anyway I wanted to share that with
you guys because I just thought you guys
might be interested in it a lot of you
guys requested so before I get into the
video I wanted to talk to you guys super
quickly about efficient cell therapy
which is what I'm using in this video
you guys will see later on but it is
basically a treatment and I absolutely
love it I've been using it for about a
month and a half now and I love it I
think I've seen amazing result it makes
my hair healthier stronger and I just
think my hair overall looks better as
acai genuinely think this product really
really works so I'm going to link them
down below the other thing that I really
love about Ovation cell therapy is that
it doesn't really matter what type of
hair you have whether you have like
curly hair you have straightener like
mine you have really damaged your like
not that damaged air it doesn't really
matter elevation so there'd be still
works in anyway but without me talking
any more um you guys can just watch the
video and I will link everything that I
use in the scription bar below and let's
get into it so first to start off I just
hop in the shower and get my hair fully
wet before I put my shampoo and in the
shampoo I'm using is this Shea Moisture
tendon one renewal shampoo actually
really love this if you do have like
more oily like a more oily scalp or with
a hair I wouldn't suggest using this
because I have a dry scalp and this is
super moisturizing em in my hair so I
just like lather that up
then I rinse it out so yes it's so
awkward like watching myself shower um
but the second step is the Ovation cell
therapy hair and scalp treatment so
again this is like the most important
step of my shower so I use this and I
put it all the way through like all the
way from my roots all the way down into
the ends of my hair and what you do with
this as you leave it in for about three
to five minutes so normally when I do
this I either like shave my legs or
watching my body but right now I'm going
to be screaming my face with my
purifying daily detox scrub this is by
Germany and this is a new product that
I've been using but I actually really
love the way it feels on my skin and
it's like charcoal I believe so I don't
know I just like the way it feels and
it's it felt it exfoliates but not like
super harsh and then yeah my face looks
crazy um now I'm going to be washing my
body with my dove soap and I don't know
I always used a pilot minimal post or
bathroom light works it's so cute but I
use this and this is the sensitive skin
one and I also have a spray tan here so
that's why I'm super super dark and my
face is really dark but the scent of
this Dove soap really helps with my
spray tan because I do not like smelling
victory tea and I think it's just it's
the corrosive smell but this soap really
helps them so now I'm going on to
shaving so this is the moisturizing
noble shade draw by completely bare and
I actually love this stuff and so I'm
just using this to shave my armpits but
just like the most unattractive thing so
I'm definitely not showing you I did
that but I did shave and then now I'm
going to rinse the Ovation cell therapy
treatment out of my hair
after I've let it sit in for about three
to five minutes and I just make sure you
get all of it out before I put my
conditioner in because I'm not really
one for like leave-in conditioners or
leaving I don't know I don't like
leaving product on my hair I'm super
weird about getting it all out so and
I'm using my Pantene a beautiful links
conditioner and this I don't know I've
just had this for a while so this is the
one I use I know
used two different shampoo and
conditioner which is super weird I don't
like using non matched products I don't
know why like if I'm using Pantene I
would rather use Pantene on Pantene but
whatever so now I'm getting out of the
shower and I wrap myself up with the
towel I wrap my hair I put the towel and
then right after that I put on my robe
just because I don't know like robes are
the most comfortable thing and I just
like walking around in a robe I like
putting my moisturizer on with the robe
I don't know it's just so comfy so
that's what I'm doing here now moving on
I am going to take that off of my head
because I only live at home for a few
seconds just so my hair is not like
dripping wet and then I'm going to take
off any excess makeup that was on my
face just with like a makeup Viper
something just because normally when I
wash my face there's always some extra
mess here that comes off in the shower
so I'm just like wiping that away and
then after that I'm going to be
moisturizing my face so I'm using the
Clinique Moisture Surge um moisturizer I
normally just switch up different ones
but I really like this one today and I
use this right after I get on shower
because my skin feels super like dry and
scaly so I am boys dry sleepies so next
end off my hair care routine I'm going
to be using this argan oil and I again
don't know I don't know the brand so I'm
gonna leave it down below but I just
focused this more towards the end of my
hair I don't really put this on the top
because I don't want to make my hair
super oily I just like it to moisturize
my hair and then I'm using my split end
treatment from Garnier which I actually
really love but again I only focus this
on the ends of my hair because I don't
put a lot of product on the top the only
product that I put in the top or route
of like my hair is the Garnier root amp
which is what I'm showing here so this
is basically just unloose and this helps
give my hair volume because I do have
really really flat hair my hair is super
straight so it's always like flat on my
head which I don't like so this I just
moisturize and it gives me some volume
so after that Sun I will either get
dressed or go way back in bed so that is
basically all for my haircare and shower
routine I hope you guys liked it I don't
know why I'm dancing but yeah hope you
guys enjoyed it thank you guys so much
for watching this video if you guys want
to see any of the products I use in this
video I will link everything in the
description hope you guys check it out
and I'll see you guys next week bye guys
I just went by and I only put up one
finger I didn't do a peace sign that is
so embarrassing okay
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
