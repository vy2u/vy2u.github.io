to be a summer essentials video
obviously as you guys can see and I have
partnered with Naked Skin pre shower tan
and I love it so I'm going to talk more
about all the products in this video I'm
very excited sure on this with you guys
because I've been wanting to make a
video just kind of things I use all
throughout the summer because I know a
lot of my beauty products and I love the
clothes I wear and all that kind of
stuff changes up when it gets hotter and
I live in Texas so it's very very hot in
the summer so let's just get into the
video so the first thing I'm going to
talk to you guys about is the naked skin
self tan so this is a pre shower tan so
how you use this is you can use this on
your face and your body and this one I
feel works really really well because it
is like a moisturizer it's also organic
so it's really really nice on your skin
and it helps um your skin so what I do
is I use this before I get in the shower
it's called a pre shower chance so you
can use it on your legs on your arms and
your stomach leave it on for 10 minutes
and then I hop in the shower and I can
wash my face you don't to do it like
super on just like a run to your face
off and then when you hop on a shower
just gently like dab where you use the
moisturizer and it when I only do it
before I go to sleep so the tan
gradually like increases within like 4
to 8 hours so I try to use it every
single time I wash my face before I go
to bed because my face always needs um
to be more tips but it just depends on
where you want this but honestly this
works so amazing and I just feel like it
looks very very natural on my skin so
I'm going to link this down below for
you guys ok so these next things are
like beauty products and so the first
one is the it cosmetics CC cream and I
know I talked about this in every school
my videos recently but this I really
really love and I feel like I'm going to
be using these all summer because they
do have SPF 50 in them and I feel like
it's so so important for you to use
sunscreen and like keep your skin
healthy and like you I don't know I just
wear sunscreen please
so I like this because it gives me very
good coverage and it also protects my
skin
the Sun another thing that I like is you
grow your skin active clearly brighter
sunscreen this is actually a moisturizer
it's a brightening and smoothing
moisturizer but it has SPF in it as well
so I can put this on kind of like as a
primer or if I'm just not going to wear
any makeup that day I put just this on
and so I know I'm still protecting my
skin and it was chosen okay so you guys
are going to be like Keaton you're so
ratchet for this but when it's the
summer I either like I'm washing my hair
every single day because I'm outside
every single day and I feel gross or I'm
literally just using dry shampoo some
dry shampoo is a like essential for my
life in the summer because I'm always
like go and go with going like at the
beach I'm like I don't know I'm just
always doing stuff and like I just feel
like during the day I sweat so much it's
so hot like I just don't want me here to
get greasy so I use dry shampoo and my
favorite is D not your mother's clean
freak or freshening dry shampoo I love
this it's still like and this is the
mini one that they have bigger ones they
have so many like amazing products from
not your mother's but this is my
favorite dry shampoo and then lastly
this is like a makeup product this is
the gold deposit mineralized skinfinish
by Mac and this is a just very gold
highlighter I love love love this
highlighter but normally in the winter
I'm very very entail and so I always go
for more like soft and gentle or I use
like the Becca highlighters everyday
because I just like the way they look um
but I like this for the summer because I
always go for a variant bronzed look in
the summer I like to be highlighted but
I like to be more bronze than I am
highlighted so I like the way this looks
on my skin okay next this is so random
but I just thought I would share this
with you guys
this is the Gillette Venus like blades
okay so these are obviously for shaving
your legs or much whatever um and the
reason I'm sharing this with you guys is
because in the summer I am all like I'll
never like not I hate I hate hate hate
going to the beach or wearing shorts and
your legs are like prickly so I always
need a good razor I need to shape just
 to shave yourself I don't I just
feel so like clean when I get into my
bed and I have like shaved legs I
no I just love it so these I just
thought I would share because I think
they're really good razor blades
obviously they go with like the Gillette
Venus look razor but I have these and I
just like always use the same razor and
then I just take the blade off or
whatever but I love these and so it's
good for the summer because I always
need to shave my legs more in the summer
than I do in the winter so my jeans you
feel me you okay so the next products
are like ideas of stuff that like just
just stuff I am always having in the
summer and I feel like every person just
needs before they start their summer go
on vacation that kind of thing like they
just need these items so the first one
is a good pair of jean shorts these are
from brandy melville but you guys can go
to any like local thrift store buy a
pair of jeans cut them size and it's
really not very hard you guys can go to
any thrift store and get a nice pair of
jeans or go to urban outfitters or just
get a pair of jeans that is comfortable
to you that don't write up that feel
comfortable make you feel good I don't
know but I always think it's very very
important before like summer begins to
like get all your clothes and like
you're like Keanu look bra less and your
jean shorts and everything like in place
just because they're just innocent like
you just need them for the summer so I
like these next thing is to have a good
bathing suit so the one I have I have
like I'm multiple like bandages I really
love but I would just say it find a
brand that really fits you very well and
buy like multiple bathing suits so I
really really love the way triangle fits
me so I have this one and this is just
like the it's just a little coral bottom
and then I have this white strapless top
and I have other ones you guys have seen
I have like the triangle ish ones but I
just think you guys should find a brand
of bathing suits that you really really
like that fit you perfectly you know how
you are in them you feel good in them
when you go out or when you're with
friends and stuff like that so find a
good bathing suit brand I know
Paxton has really really cute bathing
suits not just like in stores but you
guys go online and all you don't know if
you all like shop like me but I love
online shopping so I like going on packs
on on
and they are really really cute bathing
suits there and then also I mean
Victoria's Secret adult is always like a
plus like they always have good being
students all different ranges that kind
of thing
targets always a good spot targets
always like for the win when you like
innovating suit so just find a good
bathing suit that you guys feel
comfortable and that's what's most
important on event to that's like oh I
think this is really cute it might be
cute if you're not comfortable in it
like then it's no fun and then the next
thing is you have a good pair of
sunglasses so these are my sunglasses I
bought these from Urban Outfitters I
don't really even know how much and
where they weren't like that expensive
but they're just little round sunglasses
and I bought these because I have had
Ravens before and I have lost every pair
of ray-bans I've ever had and I feel
like it's always in like this summer
that I'm losing these sunglasses so
honestly I would go to Target I would go
to Urban Outfitters go to packs and go
to from between one get a pair of
sunglasses you guys don't need to like
go buy a pair of ray-bans or like really
expensive like Dior glasses to like go
out honestly it's really not that
important they're literally just like
shading your eyeballs like it's not that
hard so I just got these from Urban
Outfitters but I think everyone should
really invest in good like sunglasses
that look cute with everything because
it's you don't want to buy like a
fuchsia colored like fuchsia and white
colored sunglass and then it just like
doesn't go with anything so I got like a
rose gold like whatever looking sunglass
that it just goes with everything so I
would go find some I thank you you know
I'm gonna leave these here I'm gonna
just I'm going to leave this right here
okay the next thing I would recommend is
finding comfortable shoes so I am NOT a
sandal person I do not wear like little
sandals and something like with
sundresses I always am wearing converse
or literally I'm always just wearing
converse honestly the only pair of
sandals that I really like are not even
really like sandals they are
Birkenstocks and I got these in like
August remember day and I love these I
wear them with everything when I'm going
to the beach like this is what
I agree you might wear like tennis shoes
or something like when you're going
swear but I would always like pack these
in like my bag because I know once I get
sand everywhere I'm not going to want to
have those I'm going to want to have
sandals that I can just like walk around
in and look freely like where so I like
these Birkenstocks and so even if you
don't like Birkenstocks very much I know
they're not for everyone I would
recommend just going to find like a cute
pair of sandals I know Steve Madden has
like really cute just like flip-flops
and stuff like that if you guys want
those but find comfortable shoes that
really go with everything that you can
just like walk around in at all times
and the last thing that I think is just
like the most important thing ever is a
portable charger so this is always this
isn't even just in summer I mean
especially in summer I need this when
I'm traveling oh my gosh I need a
portable charge at all times because I
never know if I'm staying in a hotel
when I'm going to be home when I'm going
to be charged my phone that kind of
thing so portable chargers are so
important this one is by Murphy and I'm
pretty sure I just bought this like at
the Apple store they have tons
everywhere I know they sell them like
random stores like forever 21 but I
would recommend buying the portable
charger and just like keeping it with
you all the time because my phone is
always dying and especially in the
summer you're always taking pictures of
like everything you do like though you
have to upload them on Instagram so your
phone dies so much quicker you're always
like tweeting and like snap chatting and
doing so much more in this summer that
you just you need your phone to be
charged so a portable charger I would
highly recommend for the summer so that
is it for my summer essentials I know it
wasn't a ton but I just want to share
you guys like some things that I find
super important in the summer and I'm
like I know I need I'm always using and
hopefully it'll help you guys I know a
lot of you guys are getting out of
school soon and you guys can be prepared
for the summer with all this stuff so I
hope you guys liked it again thanks to a
nigga skin for collaborating with me for
