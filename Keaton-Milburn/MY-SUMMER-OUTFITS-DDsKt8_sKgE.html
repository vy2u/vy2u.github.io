in filming for you guys I obviously have
made a summer outfits video and yes I
didn't post for a few weeks I posted on
my Twitter and my Instagram saying that
I would not be posting for a few weeks
due to school and exams and all that
kind of stuff but I'm in summer now and
I'm so so so excited I had so much fun
filming this video and I took so much
time editing in and trying to make it
all perfect for you guys so hope you
guys like it a lot
I have tons and tons of videos planned
for this summer so stay tuned for more
of those and I am going to quit talking
and let's get into the video for my
first outfit I'm wearing a Urban
Outfitters top that I actually got from
them in section and I'm pairing it with
these brandy melville for shorts and
this is perfect for summer because it's
super lightweight and super comfortable
and then I'm wearing my favorite ruined
sandals and I just really like this
outfit it just goes together perfectly
and I did tie to share up to make it
shorter
for my second outfit I am wearing this
necklace and top from Urban Outfitters
it crosses in the front and I paired it
with these American Eagle denim jeans
and then I'm wearing the same forever 21
sandals
also I really like this outfit because
it's open in the back and so it's really
breezy for but it's hot outside during
the summer and then I added the necklace
just to make it a little more fancy and
nice I don't know I really really love
the necklace
for my third outfit I decided to wear
this Urban Outfitters button-up and it's
super comfortable and lightweight for
the beach and I paired it with the same
Urban Outfitters top and the same
American Eagle denim shorts I just
really like this it's comfortable
breezy and perfect for the beach
for my last outfit I'm actually just
realizing everything in this video is
basically from Urban Outfitters but this
is just a dress and it's super nice on
the beach I love long dress as a summer
I don't know why they're just so pretty
and nice and so this one has an open
back and it's really nice and I just AM
obsessed with it did you see her shoes
start now
we're dazzled by the same constellation
did you and your bear conspire to get me
- gotta ride cuz now I'm shining so
thank you guys so much for watching all
my social media and everything is down
below if you guys want to see any more
about the outfits I will leave

few weeks but I will be back in posting
