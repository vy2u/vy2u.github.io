just use your code I bought this and it
like makes me so happy that you guys

that with I'll be talking any more let's
get into the video so for this first
outfit I wanted to keep it super simple
I am just wearing this romper from Tiger
mist
it's just a really thick material it
almost looks like a military or like a
utility workers uniform I don't know why
um but I really love it I love just like
the style of it and the color of it it's
super simple to like style easily so I
want to dress it down so I wore my new
Yeezys which you could wear like Nike
Air Force Ones with that and then I'm
just wearing these hoops from forever 21
super basic simple outfit but I feel
like this is something you can dress up
either down or up you could wear this
with heels or something too for this
outfit the sweater has got to be my
favorite
I just want to pair to base
six items together so I'm wearing this
orange sweater from pretty little thing
absolutely love it I love that it's
cropped off the shoulder for me since
I'd probably have worn it off the
shoulder even if it wasn't and then the
shorts are from forever 21
I love the blow they make you look super
tan and then just paired it with these
Nike Air Force once and the socks are
from brandy melville I love the way the
high socks look and I just really love
this outfit this is also another super
simple outfit but it's more like
tropical esque I love the body suit so
the body suit is from forever 21 and
then the skirt I feel like makes the
look look so much better because I love
the detailing on the skirt it's from a
brand or store online called Lola
Shoetique I will link it down below but
I love the way the body suit fits and I
love how simple these just look together
and then again paired it with mine just
Nike Air Force ones you could wear heels
with this you could dress up and go to
dinner but I just loved it like this
this outfit has got to be my absolute
favorite I don't know why looking like a
train conductor or like a housemaid is
like trendy right now but the top is
from forever 21 and the dress is also
from forever 21 and the dress came
together and then I paired it with this
hat which I don't know where it's from I
know they sell them on Urban Outfitters
but this is actually someone else's hat
that I borrowed and then I paired it
with these booties they're from Steve
Madden love the way they look they're so
comfortable and I just feel like this
altogether looked super like trendy this
is very like train conductor ask but I'm
super into it for this last outfit this
has got to be the most summery so the
top is from forever 21
it's crochet I think crochet is super in
right now for the summertime I don't
know why I'm seeing crochet everywhere
and then the pants actually bought in a
set from Thai grimace they're so
comfortable I wore them when I was in
Palm Springs for Coachella and then I
paired them with these heels from Steve
Madden just a light blue suede shoe I
just think this is super summery like
vibes and I just really was into all the
colors in this so yeah I love this one
