but you gotta be there for me too yes I
know I'm blonde and in this video I have
purple hair I know I just dyed it like
yesterday
but I wanted to pop in this video
because you guys really really requested
it and workout routine and I really
wanted to film that for you but I just
wanted to have a little disclaimer
because I feel like I always have to do
that with like certain type of videos
that I'm like nervous about I am NOT a
professional I am NOT a fitness model I
literally go and get trained and workout
and this is what I like to do am i at my
ideal body that I would like to have no
but I have changed so much my body has
changed so much since I started working
out with my trainer I just want to give
you guys a realistic workout routine I
complain I am hard to work with I am
hard to train but that's honest and I
want to be as transparent with you guys
it's not like I go into the gym and I'm
like sweating and like doing all this
crazy stuff like I'm not Alexis Tran
like I'm not about to be like some crazy
fitness model this is what I do I
complain and I don't like it but I do it
because I have a goal and I want to
reach that goal so hopefully this helps
you guys and motivates you and I just
want to let you guys know that if you
are having a hard time working out or
you complain and it's hard for you and
you don't know what to do I'm in the
same boat but here I am doing it anyway
