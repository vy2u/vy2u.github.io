shirt and toys in here say hey Tori hey
Tori
um I feel like they already know you but
they already know you know because I
posted a blog with you so they're like
did you see the comments they comment
and they were like film more with Tori
Kelsie Wow I remember love story Kelsie
what's up guys in today's video is going
to be if I know vember favorites and I
only have a few products I have a lot of
music favorites this month because I
just do um so these are the hair skin
nails adult gummies they're nature made
and I bought these what I moved into
Phoenix and I've been taking them like
every single day and I just ran out and
I have new body bugs I'm taking but I
wanted to mention the house of favorites
just because I ran out of them
but I had to talk about that before so I
want to let you guys know take your
vitamins Tory start taking your vitamins
okay so the next product I'm mentioning
is this viber straight
straightener and I don't know if I've
talked but I feel like I've talked about
this before on my channel because I
don't know how I have it because I'm
obsessed with it and every time someone
comes over and make them use this train
if it isn't like guys this there's a
rainbow look look for real oh that's so
pretty
Wow I love that thank you she said you
were wrong okay back to my straightener
so I don't know how if they ever talked
about I make everyone's like I need mate
or use the straightener of the other day
I was like please just see how amazing
this is I think what I like most about
is just because it vibrates as you
straighten your hair so you don't have
creases in your hair it's just so much
more efficient to straighten my hair
with because it doesn't like it's stuck
and it's just so much faster and doesn't
damage my hair so I absolutely love this
and they're offering a amazing Black
Friday and Cyber Monday deal which is a
$99 for the one inch iron and $79 for
the purple one and a half inch iron
which is like amazing you guys should
really go check it out like if you are
looking for a new straightener and you
guys are just interested in purchasing
one I highly suggest these like I will
never go back to using a different
straightener so I will leave the link
down below if you guys wouldn't go check
them out I love them so yeah okay I have
to makeup products the first one is this
naked urban decay flushed like mini
thing this is what it looks like and the
only thing I have chalk on here is this
bronzer and I don't even know if it says
like what the bronzer shape is like I
don't know if they sell this bronzer
separately but it's been my favorite I
have it today I use it I use it
literally every single day the blush is
really pretty too I just really like
this bronzer and it looks really really
good when I'm paler which is weird
because I use it when I haven't spray
tan to I just think it works on all skin
types so I wanted to mention this I'm
gonna beat you the next one is these
color pop what are they called lippie
stix I wanted to mention these because I
normally don't like stuff like this
because I'm just like why would I use
this like tiny thing I don't ever feel
like it's pigmented enough but this is
the most amazing
literally one swipe is so we're gonna
it's so pigmented it literally looks
like a giant lipstick I don't know but I
just like that they're like portable I
can throw this in my person oh I can
throw this on my person travel with
these really easily so my favorite one
is daydream which is really pretty -
it's really pretty for fall so if you
guys are looking for inexpensive lip
colors these are so pretty for like fall
and I use them almost every single day
now and they're really easy to just like
throw in your bag if you like I always
have to retouch my lipstick just because
I'm weird like that and so I love these
for like traveling and okay and the last
peter product is this heels daily
reviving concentrate and not gonna lie
when i saw with when i got this and it
was in this little thing i didn't use it
for the longest time because i was like
this looks like some scientists stuff i
don't know how to use this it comes in
like a little like vial if that thing is
it a bio dropper
yeah like a you know that kind of thing
anyway i was looking at youtube videos
and i was looking at like different ways
to please some people put this on like a
Beauty Blender when they ran off their
makeup and stuff but I decided to start
using it as a daily moisturizer so I
just like put a little bit in my hand
and use on my face and you would think
this is like oily but it doesn't feel
oily on your face I don't know how to
describe it but it just makes my skin
feel soft and it doesn't fit with me
because I'm super weird about putting
oily stuff on my face like I just don't
like that so if you guys are looking for
like a different kind of moisturizer are
not sure how much it is but I will link
it down below because I really like this
and I think
using it and I also just makes me feel
fancy when I take off this little vial
and hang in okay so the last favourites
I'm going to mention are my music
favorites and I have a lot I have a lot
a lot so for I also if you guys don't
know I have a Spotify playlist every
month has all of my favorites so I have
like my November favorites one and this
month only thing I've basically been
