last week's video was I did a New York
vlog so I went to New York if you don't
know where the flog is I just filmed my
whole trip when I did like how it Wayne
all that fun stuff and if you didn't
watch it I'm gonna put the link like
right here something like that as you
can click that and you can watch that
before this video if not that's cool you
can just you can just watch this video
and watch the well first of all I'm just
gonna get it out of the way so I can
just get it over with
and pretty much my hair is so big um I
had it in braids for like two days
straight so it's really really curly
right now and he just needs to calm him
down not to film this video so just bear
with this
but first I'm gonna start with like the
little things which is only two but I'm
gonna go ahead and start with those so
the first thing is um it's so weird I
haven't felt like a halt and like so
long this is Mac this is a MAC lipstick
and it is in the color hip and happy so
it's I'm wearing it right now and I'm
wearing it with the MAC lipstick it's a
matte it's like the matte one it's not
like glossy or anything that's just a
matte and it is in the color pink plaid
so these two go together I think that's
what the lady told me and when I went
and bought this lipstick she gave me
this so I have that on my lips right now
and I'm really really am like I'm loving
this color like I don't know I'm just
super obsessed with it and I think it's
really pretty and it's not like bold um
next thing is I got of course when you
go to New York you have to get something
from there so I got the New York Yankees
just like bald cap maybe I can wear this
today this they had literally over a
thousand like little stores that have
like the I Love New York
oh and have like the I Love New York
shirts and all this random stuff and
they have these literally on every
street corner so if you go just like get
one for like
next thing I went to forever 21 I got
these bathing suit bottoms um also I'm
gonna be telling you the prices of the
clothes because I hate watching hauls
and then like going and like going to
the website and getting the item and
it's like $5,000 so I promise nothing
here is gonna be like too too expensive
but I'm still gonna tell you the prices
so you know um so these are just like
little bathing suit bottoms to go with
some just like white and black top that
I have and this is 1080 from forever 21
um I got a pair of black jeans I've been
meeting some black jeans I really want
to cut some up I wear like cut like I
don't know I'm gonna distress these but
these are just like normal skinny black
jeans and they were 1280 which I thought
was like really good because I spend
like fifty seven dollars on jeans like
one pair so why not get these and
they're 1280 and they fit me perfectly
fine and then I also got these pair
which is just a lighter jean color I
don't know and these were 780 literally
these jeans were seven dollars so yeah
that's what I did I also got these from
forever 21 these are just like little
floral short with those shorts I got
this top and it's just like a little
tank top and flowers on the bottom I
don't know I just needed a top to go
with it so I bought this my hair is
really stressing me out
I had to put my hair in a bun because
it's too stressful for me and it just
keeps getting in my face and losers
anyway next door is Urban Outfitters so
when I was they
I only bought one thing while I was
there it's this it has a little like I
don't know I've never bought a tank top
with like this stuff on it but just like
why not so I bought this and it just
sounds like a little eagle flying around
I don't know I thought it was really
cute this top is actually kind of
expensive it was 64 dollars I think this
was one of the most expensive things I
bought was just this top in itself I
bought this I bought this shirt for five
dollars and I'm thinking about just like
cutting it up and like making it a crop
or something like that but I just
thought those was really cute and you
can also like sleep in it if you don't
want to cut it up and stuff like that I
just got that cool okay so now I'm gonna
go to brandy Melville this is all the
rest of this is brandy Melville oh stop
this it's just it's like a t-shirt dress
kind of thing so it's strike it just had
like a little color and it looks kind of
short but I promise it's longer than it
actually is and this was 20 dollars
about this it's really like thin
yeah if you've ever bought anything from
brandy melville you know like it's
really really really soft so all all
their clothes are super soft so I bought
this and I just thought I could just
wear it blank jean shorts and like I
like band or something underneath it I
thought that was cute so this was this
was $17 and then like two years ago when
I first like found brandy melville like
went shopping there I bought like this
in black and I wear it like all the time
so I was like oh I really need one on
white so I just got this one in white
and it's $19 and this is the front it's
like a little bra let I guess how does
this this shirt they were selling at
brandy Melville but it's actually the
dog out Jake out USA whatever online so
this is there a graphic designer a
person and it just says the and zero
zero and it says it on the back this
just it's a plain black tank top I have
a bunch of white tank tops and grey tank
tops from Brandi I don't have any black
ones and I really actually needed one
that one was $12 so I got this one in
during the summer and it's really really
thin so you won't get too hot in it this
it's a dress I don't know if you can
even tell like it's just like in a few
maroon and yeah
I just really liked it it's a really
thick it's like pretty heavy and it
didn't actually have a price tag on it
when I bought it they just like looked
it up or whatever um so yeah I about
that and you guys are gonna think I'm
like totally crazy for buying all this
when it's summer but I bought like three
sweaters just because I've been looking
at him for like years and I never buy
sweaters from Brandi just because I'm
like oh like maybe another time but then
I was just like I just need to buy him
now because
I'm not gonna buy them later ever so I
bought this sweater it's like black and
white and I'm like limited and it's a
long sleeve obviously and it's cropped
it's kind of so it won't be like that
long this one I thought would just go
like really good since I just got my
hair dyed and it's tough I just thought
it would go good with like my new hair
and like me being tan I just thought
this would look really good with like my
skin tone and like my eye since I think
that's was just a light blue knit it's
not as thick as the other one and this
one was $35 this one originally I like
thought it was white and then like the
more I looked at it it's actually kind
of pink it's like a light like pink in
here so that was cool I guess and it's
just done another sweater and this was
also 35 anyways guys that was all of the
stuff that I bought while I was in New
York I hope you enjoyed it and I wasn't
like too boring but I just thought I
would show you guys in case any of you
were wondering please subscribe and
share it with anyone that you want to
share it with because like that'd be
really cool
and give it a thumbs up if you liked it
and next week I'll still be doing
another video if you haven't figured out
I post on Fridays because it's easier
for me to like I don't know it just
works with my schedule better to post on
Fridays so yeah thanks again for
