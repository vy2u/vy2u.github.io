to be my October favorites I know this
wasn't posted right when october so any
of those wasn't posted right when
october ended but i still wanted to get
a October favorites up for you guys
because I have been loving so much stuff
this one so I definitely want to share
that with you um so yeah let's just get
into it so the first product I want to
show you guys is the Too Faced Born This
Way absolute perfection foundation which
is oil free as well and this foundation
I'm sure you guys probably seen
everywhere because a lot of people are
talking about this right now but i
really really love this foundation to
have it on right now and it's probably
the only foundation i've been using um
but I use this also in my last makeup
tutorial and I just really really like
the coverage that it has I don't think
I've ever really had a foundation that's
as good as this with coverage and so if
you're looking for a new foundation
that's really really good coverage that
you can also build to this is really
really good for that and I also just
think the wait what am I try to say
what's the name of this the color
basically shade of this foundation
notches super super well and they have
it in a ton of colors so I think it's
really really good for anyone looking
for this kind of foundation next is a
concealer and this is so weird for me to
even be like talking about because I
don't use concealers and I've never used
a concealer before um but I got this and
as the knicks gotcha Covered cover its
total foundation so this is just a
waterproof concealer and I got it in the
shade light or number two whatever that
means this is one of the best concealers
I've ever used and I know I just said I
don't really use concealers but I'm
telling you guys this concealer is so
good like it literally covers everything
so perfectly what I can't even describe
it other than it just conceals amazing
and I recently just started getting a
bunch of pimples on my face what what's
new what's new but the I don't think I
can go single favorites video without
dropping something I always do but this
is amazing and it's been covering all of
my little
blemishes and really really helping with
that so it definitely recommend this and
they also do have it in a ton of darker
shades next is this tart blush and this
is in the shade exposed and I love this
color guys it's just like a really light
pink it looks a little darker on camera
but it's actually a little lighter than
this and I just really really like it
for fall even though it's almost like a
spring color I don't know it kind of
like ghosts with my nails I don't by the
way while you guys are asking what
colored nail polish i have actually have
acrylic nails they're fake so like it's
not actual color it just go up into the
nail place and get a color but anyway
back to this blush okay so this is just
like a really pretty pink color I just
like have been using it a lot because I
got outlawed by NARS which I still
absolutely love but it was a really big
difference from the core Alyssa one and
it's like a deep red and this is
completely different so I guess I'm just
like feeling this color right now I
don't really know but love this next is
the tartlet palette and this has been my
go-to all months and so I also used it
in my last makeup tutorial but i really
really love this and it is just like the
most beautiful shades like it just has i
mean it has like dark Browns and has
purples it's perfect I love it though i
have been using this a lot i actually
picked it out because i was getting my
makeup done and then the girl that did
my makeup was using this and i was like
what is that also packaging is so cute
it's like chrome and oh my good i can't
even open it um but it's like chrome and
shiny and just so cute i love it so next
is the Garnier Fructis new full and
plush root in this is a root lifting
spray moose so I do not really use a lot
of hair products you guys are always
asking for hair care routines my hair
care routine is get in the shower
shampoo and condition my hair and let it
air dry like that's all I do but since i
got this i've been using a lot because
my hair is actually really really flat
because it's naturally straight and this
has helped lift my roots a ton so when i
get all the shower it's a
white mousse and I just like to spray it
in this front of my hair and then I'll
like flip my head welcome new tutorial I
just flip my head and like spread here
and you just kind of rub it in and you
sleep on it and it's whatever and then
like in the morning it has a bit more
volume and i don't know i think it works
for me I've noticed a difference so I
really really like this and it also
gives more texture to my hair because
I'm weird and when I wash my hair I
don't like the super silky like I like
my hair to be kind of messy so this
gives a good texture to my hair after
it's just been washed so that is all for
the makeup and beauty products moving on
to fashion ish kind of things so the
first one is this purse and it's
actually and do I know but it's just a
little fringe bag and I originally have
bought it to go to a CL which I've
logged you guys can go click the vlogs
um but yeah I bought this go to a CL
because I needed something that was like
over like my shoulder and easy to carry
around other than like a hand back so i
bought this and this is from forever 21
absolutely loving have been using it a
lot more lately and I didn't really
realize how much I needed a black
leather bag I don't have a black leather
bag so I really really like this for
that and it's way more casual than my
other person I like this next you guys
have been asking about this jacket for
ever and on all my Instagram pictures
but I did tag it on my Instagram um this
is from brandy melville and it is just
this cute little coat oh my god I can't
even show you guys but it is just a
giant Grey Cup ah QUT's i will insert a
picture here so you guys can see it but
i love this coat it keeps me so warm and
i live in texas and it's like 100
degrees right now but it's fine because
when i go to a colder climate i can wear
this again oh but I really really have
been loving the jacket and I wore it all
through New York and I originally bought
it in New York globe is there because I
wasn't smart and I didn't bring a good
enough jacket so I really really like
that and yeah that's it for the fashion
now I have one more like random little
favorite and it is the marshmallow
fireside candle by bath and body works
and everyone is talking about this
handle and I bought it oh my gosh i just
opened it up and I have to light it I
really do I bought it like a while ago
and I hadn't lid it yet i think i bought
it in like mid-september but i hadn't
let it because i want to wait to october
it smells so good guys it literally
smells marshmallows and Fire sounds like
it is exactly what it says I don't know
how they get the sense and you're like
they do but it's so good and it has a
really good like I don't know how to
describe it but it really fills my
entire like not just my room but like my
house like my mom will come home Vic
what's that lit and it's like something
in my room and it's this candle it
smells so good I supposed to like the
other Bath and Body Works kinjal I got
it's called like red maple or something
like that and it doesn't smell as strong
as this this is a really really strong
sweet scent and I love this so it's not
as strong as the other one the other one
still smells really good but it doesn't
quite like my whole house into a
marshmallow but guys if you oh my gosh I
don't even know if you're like into
these sense or whatever but like it
smells so good i'm gonna keep it in my
lap just like open second I can smell it
next is music favorites and I actually
have a Spotify which I mentioned so you
guys can go follow me on Spotify I did
not expect for as many of you guys to

not I don't know like I never really
follow people on Spotify like youtubers
or famous people I've never I don't know
like I don't follow anyone on Spotify I

also in this a lot of music I use in my
vlogs and stuff will most likely be on
my Spotify so if you're ever looking for
like other music or maybe a song I used

next one is the way by Kalani featuring
chance rapper not that new but I just
kind of got into it and I really really
like that song and then I have drama by
Roy woods featuring Drake which is
