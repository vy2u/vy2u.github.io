to be my October favorites I know this
wasn't posted right when October so I
know this wasn't posted right when
October ended but I still wanted to get
a October favorites up for you guys
because I have been loving so much stuff
this month so I definitely want to share
that with you so yeah let's just get
into it so the first product I want to
share with you guys is the Too Faced
Born This Way absolute perfection
foundation which is oil free as well and
this foundation I'm sure you guys
probably seen everywhere because a lot
of people are talking about this right
now but I really really love this
foundation to have it on right now and
it's probably the only foundation I've
been using but I use this also in my
last makeup tutorial and I just really
really like the coverage that it has I
don't think I've ever really had a
foundation that's as good as this with
coverage and so if you're looking for a
new foundation that's really really good
for coverage that you can also build -
this is really really good for that and
I also just think the wait what am I
trying to say what's the name of this
the color basically shade of this
foundation not just super super well and
they have it in a ton of colors so I
think it's really really good for anyone
looking for this kind of foundation next
is a concealer and this is so weird for
me to even be like talking about because
I don't use concealers and I've never
used a concealer before but I got this
and it is the NYX gotcha Covered cover
its total foundation so this is just a
waterproof concealer and I got it in the
shade white or number two whatever that
means this is one of the best concealers
I've ever used and I know I just said I
don't really use concealers but I'm
telling you guys this concealer is so
good like it literally covers everything
so perfectly what I can't even describe
it other than it just conceals amazing
and I recently just started getting a
bunch of pimples on my face what what's
new what's new but the I don't think I
can go a single favorites video without
dropping something I always do but this
is amazing and it's been covering all of
my little
well alysha's and really really helping
with that so I definitely recommend this
and they also do have it in a ton of
darker shades next is this Tarte blush
and this is in the shade exposed and I
love this color guys it's just like a
really light pink it looks a little
darker on camera but it's actually a
little lighter than this and I just
really really like it for fall even
though it's almost like a spring color I
don't know it kind of like goes with my
nails and by the way while you guys are
asking what colored nail polish I have I
actually have acrylic nails they're fake
so like it's not actual color it just go
up into the nail place and get a color
but anyway back to this blush okay so
this is just like a really pretty pink
color I just like I've been using it a
lot because I got outlawed by nurse
which I still absolutely love but it was
a really big difference from the
coreless one and it's like a deep red
and this is completely different so I
guess I'm just like feeling this color
right now I don't really know but love
this next is the tartlet palette and
this has been my go-to all months and so
I also used it in my last makeup
tutorial but I really really love this
and it is just like the most beautiful
shades like it just has I mean it has
like dark Browns and has purples it's
perfect I love it so I have been using
this a lot I actually picked it out
because I was getting my makeups done
and then the girl that did my makeup was
using this and I was like what is that
also packaging is so cute it's like
chrome and good but it's like chrome and
shiny and just it's so cute I love it so
next is the Garnier Fructis new full and
plush root in this is a root lifting
spray mousse so I do not really use a
lot of hair products you guys are always
asking for hair care routines my hair
care routine is get in the shower
shampoo and conditioner my hair and what
it air-dry like that's all I do but
since I got this I've been using a lot
because my hair is actually really
really flat because it's naturally
straight and this has helped lift my
roots a ton so when I get on the shower
it's a white mousse and
just like spray it in this part of my
hair and then I'll like flip my head I
just flip my head and like spread here
and you just kind of rub it in and you
sleep on it and it's whatever and then
like in the morning it has a bit more
volume and I don't know I think it works
from me I've noticed a difference so I
really really like this and it also
gives more texture to my hair because
I'm weird and when I wash my hair I
don't like the super silky like I like
my hair to be kind of messy so this
gives a good texture to my hair after
it's just been washed so that is all for
the makeup and beauty products moving on
to fashion is kind of things so the
first one is this purse and it's
actually and dear I know but it's just a
little fringe bag and I originally have
bought it to go to a CL which I've
logged you guys can go click the vlogs
um but yeah I bought this could it see
all because I needed something that was
like over like my shoulder and easy to
carry around other than like a handbag
so I bought this and this is from
forever 21 absolutely loving I've been
using it a lot more lately and I didn't
really realize how much I needed a black
leather bag I don't have a black leather
bag so I really really like this for
that and it's way more casual than my
other purse oh I like this next you guys
have been asking about this jacket for
ever and on all my Instagram pictures
but I did tag it on my Instagram this is
from brandy melville and it is just this
cute little coat oh my god I can't even
show you guys but it is just a giant
gray cup with little pockets I will
insert a picture here so you guys can
see it but I love this coat it keeps me
so warm and I live in Texas and it's
like 100 degrees right now but it's fine
because when I go to a colder climate I
can wear this again and I really really
have been loving the jacket and I wore
it all through New York and I originally
bought it and New York LA was there
because I wasn't smart and I didn't
bring a good enough jacket so I really
really like that and yeah that's it for
the fashion now I have one more like
random little favorite and it is the
marshmallow fireside candle by Bath and
Body Works and everyone is talking about
this candle and I bought it Oh Mike
I just opened it up and I have to line
it I really do I bought it like a while
ago and I hadn't lit it yet I think I
bought it in like mid-september but I
hadn't lit it because I want to wait to
October it smells so good guys it
literally smells marshmallows and fire
sound like it is exactly what it says I
don't know how they get the sense and
you're like they do but it's so good and
it has a really good like I don't know
how to describe it but it really fills
my entire like not just my room but like
my house like my mom will come home Vic
what's that lit and it's like something
in my room and it's this candle it
smells so good I suppose like the other
bath and Bodyworks kinjal I got it's
called like red maple or something like
that and it doesn't smell as strong as
this this is a really really strong
sweet scent and I love this so it's not
as strong as the other one the other one
still smells really good but it doesn't
quite like my whole house into a
marshmallow but guys if you oh my gosh I
don't even know if you're like into
these scents or whatever but like it
smells so good I'm gonna keep it in my
lap just like open second next is music
favorites and I actually have a Spotify
which I mentioned so you guys can go
follow me on Spotify I did not expect
fresman heap you guys to follow me on
Spotify like you did I'm just not I
don't know like I never really follow
people on Spotify like youtubers or
families people I've never I don't know
like I don't follow anyone on Spotify I
just make my own playlists but a lot of
you guys follow me which is so awesome
because it makes me feel like my music
taste is like good and that's like one
of the best compliments okay whatever
anyway so these are like all my little
playlist and I make September favorites
in October favorites playlist so I've
only ever made once then I just started
Spotify so I only have a September
favourite twist and now I have knocked
over favourites
and I will read to you the names of
everything in my October favorites so
the first one is Love Me by the 1975
I've been waiting for new music from
them for so long and this song is really
really good it's not their best but I
can't tell them they're gonna be coming
out with really good
music later on so I like this one also
obviously infinity and perfect by one
direction like come on guys
did you see the music video because my
heart I'm like literally crying I love
one direction so much if you guys like
don't know that um the next one is you
and me this is the disclosure flume
remix which I use in my ACL vlog a lot
of you guys are asking about that one
that is also in this a lot of music I
use in my vlogs and stuff will most
likely be on my Spotify so if you're
ever looking for like other music or
maybe a song I used in a video most
likely on my Spotify the next one is the
way by Kalani featuring chance rapper
not that new but I just kind of got into
it and I really really liked that song
and then I have drama by Roy woods
featuring Drake which is really really
good I don't know it's just like a good
song it's like 5 to you I guess and then
the next one is touched by Pia Mia
so I have been also waiting for new
music from Pia Mia for forever you guys
don't even understand how long I've been
fans
I feel like right before like Kylie
Jenner became friends with her I was
like listening to her music cuz she's so
perfect and then when I found out they
were friends I was like no stop like I
love Kylie and I love Pia they're
perfect I've been waiting for any music
from her forever and she just released a
new song called touch and so I think her
album is coming up pretty soon not
hundred percent sure but the songs
really good
then there's hello by Adele which is
amazing like there's no words to even
describe that song it's so good but yes
I put that in there

Justin Bieber those two songs oh my god

tiller because his entire album is so
good like I'm not even kidding I've been
listening to it like a month and a half
