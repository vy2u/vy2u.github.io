actually kind of interesting like not
going to my own war but they are really
interesting and I have a lot of Tam if
you guys can go over there and watch all
of it I will eat them all down below so
every single day when I went and did
stuff I was just much much pet corners
and went to Glanville which is
Dermalogica I was bowling with Wiz
Khalifa all of it is in my blog so I'll
leave all of las link down below you

this video is just to give you guys a
little bit of inspiration for spring
outfits I know it's getting a bit warmer
where I went I live in Phoenix and so I
wanted to incorporate this this month so
I hope you guys like to see you and
let's get into it so for this first out
that we ate at commissary which is
actually at the line of Cal the food's
amazing as you can see but it was really
green it's in a greenhouse so to kind of
go with that I have this choker and this
jumpsuit on so the choker is actually my
mom's but they have a really really
similar one that tags them that's just
cheetah which I love and then the
jumpsuit is actually from Urban
Outfitters and it is a satin green
jumpsuit and I just had my backpack
which I have in all of my outfits in my
backpack is from forever 21 and has a 50
keychain and I tried it with Judy
get my things I can't
so for this day we obviously went to
Disneyland it was so fun but I wanted to
be cute and casual at the same time so I
wore this black and red striped top from
Zara and the jeans are from Zara as well
they're probably my new favorite pair of
jeans I just wore some adidas Superstars
and I love the jeans are super frayed at
the ends and I don't know they just
looks super cute and these sunglasses I
have are from forever 21 and I paired
them with some really cute Mickey ears
so this day was actually super casual as
well but I did go to Smashbox cosmetics
headquarters and how this really pretty
walk down the street and it was just so
cute like so an outfit in front of it
my sunglasses and my tops are from
forever 21 my belt is from Urban
Outfitters and my jeans are Topshop
jeans and I wore them with adidas
superstars
just super simple but also like cute and
I don't know trendy as in I wore my
backpack along with that
so this day actually went bowling
obviously and it was actually for a
event so there was like celebrities
there and all that I want it to be like
dressy ish but also casual so the dress
is from urban jean jacket is from Brandi
and then thigh high boots are from
forever 21 and I just thought it was
super simple easy for bowling and I
don't know it looks kind of put together
way more than a salad ring everything
over so like me up in the frame so this
day I got to go to be Glencoe
headquarters which was so beautiful with
his wife on the outfit here but my skirt
is from forever 21 and wearing the same
jean jacket from Brandi and I'm wearing
my adidas superstars because I love
stuff guys I don't know what I ever did
without them and then I'm actually
wearing a body suit underneath the skirt
which is from Brandi in the back of it
is open which I thought was really
really pretty
I also paired the outfit with two
necklaces the top one is from forever 21
and the bottom one is from brandy
