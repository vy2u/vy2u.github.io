something
what's up guys so today's video is
obviously going to be a prom get ready
with me and I am so excited because I've
honestly always wanted to do this kind
of video I just never I'm I don't know
I'm just like weird about it and I
wanted everything to be perfect but when
prom growth contacted me and I bought
this dress I literally was dead this is
I wanted this dress for so so long and
I'm just so happy that I get to showed
you guys in this video also this makeup
look that I'm showing you guys is the
makeup look I had on in my cute outfits
like intro and everyone was commenting
like oh my god your makeup please show
us how to do it so luckily and this is
the exact makeup look I had and so I
hope you guys like this video also I
have very special announcements at the
end of this so please stay till the very
end and yeah so I'm using my be or face
wash and this is just shown off camera
but then I'm also moisturizing my face
after I wash it and this is the skin
longevity by bare minerals and then at
the moisturizer by bare minerals and I
know it really need the skin longevity
but they just came together and I really
like the way they smell and feel on my
skin so I'm just mr. Isaac
also please ignore the weird thing under
my eye it's like a rash but I admit it's
important it's going away but moving on
I have my little coffee in my mug is
from Anthropologie anyway I'm priming my
face and this is the makeup forever
except one primer I'll leave everything
down below and I'm just priming my face
because if you're going to prom you want
your makeup to stay on all night all
debt you want to wake up the next
morning and look just the same okay not
really but anyway okay moving on so this
is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation and then I decided to pull my
hair back because it was really ratchet
and getting in my way
so yeah I'm just using this foundation
obviously my neck is a completely
different color than my face I just got
sprayed and it's super dark so yeah and
then because I want to blend that more
I'm just using my Beauty Blender to like
press it in and then I'm using my
Maybelline age rewind and I am
highlighting my face so I'm putting this
underneath my eyes in a triangle shape
on my Cupid's bow and down my nose like
on my forehead and stuff then of course
I'm blending that out with a Beauty
Blender also I decided after like
blending all of my highlighting that I
want it to be more highlighted because I
didn't realize helped and I was so I
added some Clinique highlighter on after
this so I used my Bobbi Brown foundation
stick to contour and then I went back in
again with my highlighter by Clinique to
brighten my face up some more
then of course I'm blending that all
back out with my beauty blender don't
mind me I'm going to be keep I'm going
to keep doing this like fishy face when
I blend and like contour to highlight my
face I don't know why when I was looking
back editing this footage I was like
Keaton why are you still doing that face
it's not necessary but anyway moving on
so I'm going to bake my face with this
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
and I'm just using my Beauty Blender to
put this underneath my eyes and then I'm
using my straight edged brush from zoeva
and I'm putting this under where I
contoured just because I really like
like the defined look of level where my
contour is where the line is and
honestly this isn't perfect I'm not
really good at it but it helps so I'm
moving on I go to my eye as well of that
big so I'm just filling in my eyebrows
with the anastasia dipbrow pomade i
think it's in soft brown and i'm just
lightly filling them in and then I'm
using my pure contour stick the
highlighting side and I just use this to
conceal my eyelids before I put my
eyeshadow on and it also helps like make
my eyebrows look straighter and more
like perfected I guess so the eyes so
for this whole look I'm going to be
using the Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette but first I'm going to using
my Anastacio dip brow pomade and this is
how I'm going to kind of create a cut
crease don't like quote me on that I'm
not really good at them but I'm creating
a line with my anastacio dip brow where
my crease and my like full lid are and
then I'm blending it out with like a
smaller brush just to make it not so
harsh because like the this whole this
whole eye look is just blending so then
I'm taking a lighter brown shade to make
the line again not so harsh I'm gonna
lift I'm gonna list all the shades down
below cuz I kind of forgot the names of
all of them but then I'm going in I'm
just keep adding um lighter
I mean darker shades of brown on top so
I'm adding truffled and putting I think
from the semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette together and I'm making it
really dark and I want to focus the you
want to focus on the outer corner to
make things darker and then as you see I
went in with
which is a just black shade and I put
that in the crease and with working like
working with black shades on your lid
you want to make sure you really really
blend it all out because then it just
looks like you smudged eyeliner or
something so again I'm just blending
this for a really long time with like
the light brown shades in the dark brown
shades and then where I want to create
like the dark on the top and the white
all over the lid I'm going to go back in
with my concealer from the pur cosmetics
stick basically any concealer or
something will work for this and then
I'm going to be going in with a shimmery
shade honestly I use this from the in
bloom palette but that's really annoying
so you can just use the champagne color
from the semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette which is the color I'm putting
right here on the center so you can
basically use that for the whole lid and
then I use gosh I don't remember the
name but I am going to assume again down
below I use a darker Brown right on the
outside of my lid and then I blended it
all back together just to give that
illusion dark on the outer corner and
then really really light and bright on
the whole lid so now I'm wiping away all
of the translucent powder I had set and
I'm kind of smearing it over my face
again to kind of set my whole face with
it and then now time to contour and fix
my one dimensional face so I'm using my
shade and light palette by Kat Von D and
I'm using the same straight edge brush
to kind of put the darkest shade in the
corner and then I'm going to be using my
Clinique bronzer and I'm putting this
just on my cheekbones I'm making sure
that I get all the bronzer upwards you
don't want to put your bronzer like
below where you already highlight it
because that doesn't make any sense so
yeah I'm doing that and then I'm using
my NARS blush and I'm just focusing this
on the apples of my cheeks and now for
my favorite part which is highlighting
so I'm taking my Becca of Jacqueline
hello highlighters and I'm mixing the
two the one on the left and the center
and I'm putting these from the high
points of my cheeks and then I'm also
gonna put it down my nose on my Cupid's
bow all that kind of stuff I love a
highlighted look so this is the best
now her false lashes which I suck at so
I definitely did them off camera but
that glue from kiss is the best I'll
link it down below or something because
it's so good but yeah then I'm using my
it cosmetics superhero mascara which is
my new favorite and look at the
difference between false lashes in my
real ones so annoying but yeah so now
I'm doing my lips and of course I'm
using SPICE lip liner because what else
do I use guys this is the only lip liner
I use so I use spice lip liner to fill
it in and then I put honey web which is
like a nude kind of like a brown shade
to mix with spice and then I'm topping
it off with NARS lip gloss in the shade
oldies and this just makes it the whole
look come together I'm not a gloss girl
but this is the best so for hair I'm
just curling my hair like I would
regularly I'm using my nume wand and
like the largest barrel they have and
I'm just curling my hair away from my
head because I don't know I just like
the way that looks better but also it's
best to like rotate how you curl your
hair some pieces I would curl away and
some I would curl towards my face just
depends so after I comb my hair I'm
going to be hair spraying it so I just
took Garnier hair spray and like sprayed
it all and made it look really fluffy
and then after that honestly if you want
to just leave your hair down how it
regularly is I debated doing that but
yeah I just decided to braid it so I
just have to take the front section a
really small part and Dutch braid my
hair so that's really really easy it's
just like a regular braid except of
going over the middle section you go
under I learned it by watching someone
else's YouTube video and I thought I
could show you in this video but it just
you can't even tell what I'm doing so I
Dutch braided the front part and then I
regularly braided it all the way to the
back and I just bobby pinned my hair to
the back but once I did both sections of
my hair and I bobby pin them I realized
it looked kind of bad so I actually got
my mom to put the two braids in like a
little clear elastic rubber band to hold
the
together which looks better you'll see
you later in the video so that is it for
the makeup part of the video and also
the hair I hope you guys alike do this
and now to my favorite part the dress so
I got my dress from prom girl and it is
a two-piece sheer hill dress the top is
all sequin it's a really long skirt and
it has this really pretty slit in the
front and guys you don't understand I've
been looking for the stress since last
year and they were all out of sale and
then when I saw they had them on prom I
was like that's the one I want like it's
amazing I'm obsessed with it and I just
wore like strappy Steve Madden heels
with it and I just really really love
the way it looks and I think that the
hair and the makeup really complimented
the outfit so I hope you guys like this
video and stay tuned and because I'm
