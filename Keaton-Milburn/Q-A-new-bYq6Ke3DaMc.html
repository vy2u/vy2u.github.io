while and I know I see that literally
every single video but this time I am
really starting to try and make more
YouTube videos and I got a ton of
questions for on this question and
answer it was probably over 100
questions on my tumblr so I'm gonna try
and answer them all for you guys I can't
answer all them because there's so many
but we're gonna try I'm gonna try and
get through the first question is where
are you from I was born in Louisiana but
I live here in Texas and I have lived
here like my why do you use your iPhone
for your Instagram pictures or a nice
camera I use my I have iPhone 5 so I use
this that's all I use and it's pretty
much hit what's your favorite place to
shop online I love online shopping
probably more than like going to the
mall on going shopping but I
besides pretty mobile I like to show up
on like Urban Outfitters and PacSun and
Nasty Gal
places that I don't have here in Houston
like places that are in California I
like shopping online there and a lot of
places like in Australia and stuff like
that I like to shop at places like that
what kind of shampoo and conditioner do
you use I just use keratin which is just
like the tan bottle just keratin
what does your diet
um I normally diet I just kind of like
like I tried to eat as healthy as I can
like I try not to eat junk food but like
of course every once in a while like I'm
gonna go like have ice cream and like
eat cake and like you know stuff like
that but for most of the time I try and
eat healthy because I don't know I just
feel better about myself when I eat
healthy
do you work out I don't necessarily like
work out like I don't have certain days
of the week where I'm like okay I'm
going Jim this is saying this day but I
do try and go to the gym every once in a
while if I do work out it's either like
running like I try and run like at least
twice a week or like once a week and if
I do it's like three miles or something
like that and then if I go to the gym
just you like AB like for the Mac I'm
machines and like like stuff and things
like that what hair products geez I use
this a lot it's the brand that I use is
pull not your mother's they have them at
like Urban Outfitters for some reason
but this one is just refreshing dry
shampoo and I use this sometimes and not
a lot because I'd only use heat on my
hair but it P protect it it's called VP
feet mister same brand and it's just
like before you straighten your hair you
can put this on it and it'll help like
not and then this I also use a lot which
is beach babe texturizing spray and so I
use this when I have like wet hair like
damp hair and it's like wavy and this
helps hold the
last thing that I used is Moroccan oil
so after I take a shower and my hair is
like wet I don't normally brush my hair
when I get out of shower so if I put
this through it I just run it like
through my hair it makes it a lot softer
and it like gets all the tangles out and
then when I sleep in it like that it um
is really soft and this one is do you
know Jesus yes I do I'm a Christian so
yeah do you like to party have you ever
consumed alcohol or done drugs
I'm not look like a party you're like I
like going out with my friends and like
hanging out and speak that but I don't
drink and do drugs or anything like that
kind of books do you read I've read
obviously like all john green's books
like his books are amazing okay and then
like after I finished those like a year
ago it had to find someone else to read
so I read like Colleen Hoover I like her
and I read if I stay I forgot the author
but I liked that one and there's a
second book to it that I need to read
and yeah it's just like books like that
I don't have a type of books it just
kind of pick whatever do you have a job
no I don't have a job I need a job how
tall are you
I'm five five last time I checked I was
in five five is your hair naturally
straight this right now is my natural
hair
and yeah it's pretty straight normally
but it's not I don't always wear it like
this like if I get out of the shower and
I blow-dry my hair and then I just brush
it out then it looks like this but if I
get out of the shower and I just sleep
with it and it's like wave you're in the
morning I just notice what do you use to
edit your pictures like apps wise I use
vsco cam and I use after light and those
are pretty much on tools and use and
then Square D which is like the white
background that you can put those are
pretty much all the questions I did have
to like narrow it down because there's a
lot of the same questions and I don't
keep answering some of the same
questions if you have any other
questions that I didn't answer in this
video you can ask me below and I'll
answer and that's pretty much it thank
