youtube questions so this is a Q&amp;amp;A I'm
not just gonna be answering it's so
white um but this is the Q&amp;amp;A I'm not
just gonna be answering random questions
I'm going to be answering you guys
questions about YouTube so I know wanna
youtubers have done like videos on like
tips on how to make a youtube channel
but I didn't want to do one of those
because I feel like my channel is so
growing and there's probably some things
that I don't even know so I'm not gonna
have like I'm like a professional
youtuber when honestly I'm just gonna
answer you guys questions on what I've
done that has helped my channel but yeah
so I hope you guys like this video and
let's get to the questions so the first
most asked question about my youtube is
how did you get started on YouTube so
the way I got started was I had a
Instagram and I thought at the time I
had a lot of Assyrian followers I really
didn't have anything I was pretty lame
and everyone was commenting on my answer
and pictures and they were like you
should start a YouTube channel and I was
like I don't know what that is like I
don't know what the point of that is so
I made a youtube channel I decided to
ask people to ask me questions I have
like ten questions and I answered them
on in the video and that was it so for
awhile this was my freshman year I
started making YouTube
and then I mean this is for another
video but I basically was very insecure
with myself very uncomfortable on camera
and I also got picked on a lot for
making YouTube videos at the time the
win really did that obviously I was a
freshman in high school and I was like
I'm gonna make videos and no one really
did that so um I I mean I got comments
who'd be like oh she's really weird she
does that so it kind of got to me and I
stopped for a while which you guys may
not know because actually all the videos
are now on private and no one could see
my old videos um but then I started back
up I think into my sophomore year and
when I started back up I was a lot more
comfortable with myself and I didn't
really care what like anyone had to say
about if they liked my videos or not I
liked it so I started um uploading
videos consistently doing it every few
weeks and stuff like that and I got
really into it cuz I thought it was
really fun I really like fashion and
makeup I mean I still do and so I
started making videos like that and
that's just how I kept going and then
ever since then it's just grown a lot
and it's really crazy because a lot of
people always say like oh like I didn't
know anything about YouTube and I
literally didn't know anything about
YouTube I did not watch any I didn't
know there was beauty gurus I didn't
know anything I didn't watch youtube
videos before I made a youtube channel
like so people asked me you know what
inspired you or what youtuber inspired
you to make a channel um no one really
did because I didn't watch videos before
I started a YouTube channel now
obviously I'm obsessed
but yeah before I did it I had no one
like telling me anything about it so
that's kind of how I got started and
kept going with it what is your favorite
thing about being a youtuber so I think
my favorite thing about being a youtuber
is being able to have a whole other
community of people that you can
actually like get along with for the
most part there's a negative people on
YouTube but for the most part like I
love being able to just like if I'm at
school or I'm like having a bad day or
like everything's good I mean I know
like you can post a picture on Instagram
and you guys will come I like such a
nice thing so you guys would tweet me
nice things or you know comment on my
YouTube videos and stuff like that give
me inspiration as
like you know why shouldn't be negative
so I think I've everything about being a
youtuber it's just like meeting a bunch
of different people and communicate with
bunch of different people I've met my
best friend Holly on YouTube like she
literally comment on one of my videos
and she's my best friend so I think it's
just like that aspect it's people don't
really get that you can literally make
real friendships and real like
connections of people through the
internet it's so weird but it happens so
I think that's my favorite thing your
biggest accomplishment ever since you
started YouTube I think one of the
biggest things was when I hit a hundred
thousand that was really really amazing
to me and I got my little silver plaque
and everything and that's awesome and
just different things just little things
I got to go to beauty con and that was
like one of the highlights of like
anything in my life is I got to go to
Beauty Conan's I loved it um I don't
know there every day there's just
something I'm just like oh my gosh thank
God I have like YouTube were like they
got this so yeah that's just like my
favorite thing about it is it ever
awkward vlogging of public I got a lot
of questions like this okay when I first
started my freshman year I would have
never ever vlog first of I didn't know
what blogging was but I would have never
ever blogs I was so uncomfortable and I
did not want people looking at me even
when I would edit my old videos I would
feel uncomfortable watching myself like
on my computer but for me like I know
why I'm doing it I know like you know I
have you guys that are gonna watch and
stuff so I'll sacrifice someone being
like she's weird for me to upload a
video for you guys it doesn't really
bother me that much okay dude kids out
of your school give you a hard time when
you started the channel so that was the
main thing was when I was a freshman I
first started it was like it would be
any negative comment anyone anything I'd
say wouldn't even be negative it would
just be like oh like like oh she's
little girl that makes YouTube videos
and I was like oh my god like why you
talking about me and it wasn't even
anything was just a comment about yeah
she's the girl that makes YouTube videos
so it really bothered me and that's what
kind of like made me stop originally and
then once I got way more comfortable
with myself I started making them and
that doesn't mean that negative comments
will stop I get negative comments all
the time I don't know it's just there's
always gonna be someone saying anything
whether it's at your school whether it's
any way anywhere you go there's always
gonna be someone has to say
Something About You but at this point
doesn't really bother me that much I
mean I do have people on my school are
like oh yeah she makes YouTube video she
thinks she's so cute and I'm just like I
don't know like I make youtube videos
because I like it you know so um I don't
really let anyone's negative comments
like get to me if I did probably still
wouldn't be doing this right now but I
love it and so I do for you guys so
that's why I'm still doing it what is
the best thing a youtuber ever gave you
so I think probably the best thing and
this might be cheesy I don't know but
it's true so I think probably one of the
best things youtuber gave me is when I
first started my channel I was
subscribed to Ali Marie Evans and Ali
for watching this hey girl um but yeah I
was subscribed to her and I remember um
she posted on one of her videos and she
was like I'm going to the gallery in
Houston which I thought was so random
she loves LA so I was like this is so
random are you gonna be at the gallery
of Houston like doing a meet-up or
something like that so I was like okay
I'll go whatever so I told my mom let's
go to Galleria we'll meet her whatever
so we get there and she was so nice I
mean that was the first youtuber I had
ever met and I didn't have a lot of
subscribers at the time like at all I
literally had like yeah none but um I
remember I wanted to meet her because I
kind of wanted her advice on you know
when I was so nervous I was so
uncomfortable with like myself you um
but yeah I met her and she just told me
you know like I think you're challenging
really good well I my mom was with me
and she was asking her questions and she
was just like yeah you just need to be
yourself all this kind of stuff and I
remember I remember like leaving and
feeling like you know what I think I can
do this like YouTube being like I think
I can like upload consistently and
actually try and I remember she just
really inspired me to keep you know
making videos because I was kind of
confused as to like why I was doing
YouTube and once I saw her you know
doing like a meet-up at the owner and
stuff I was like this is so cool like if
I were to be able to do that so that's
kind of what inspired me and I remember
she posted an Instagram picture with me
on her Instagram and I kind of took it
as probably as not sure but I kind of
took it as like oh my gosh like maybe
she saw something in me um that like she
liked and so she thinks I can you know
continue to this whole YouTube thing and
so that's why she uploaded it and I
remember thinking that was so cool we
you know
each other on Instagram and Twitter and
stuff like that and she's awesome and
she's so nice and I still watch her
videos today she just uploaded like the
20 things I learned at 20 I think that's
what it was and it was so good so Ali if
you're watching this freaking other
videos still this is a lot what do you
use to edit your videos so um what I use
Final Cut Pro X I think that's what it's
called so I use that I used iMovie for a
long long time and I would not recommend
going in it's just like a tip from like
my perspective I would not recommend if
you're first starting YouTube channel go
buy a really expensive camera a tripod
lighting all this stuff like editing
software because like I mean you could
do it for a month and then be like okay
I'm not into this and you just spent all
this money like so much money on all
this equipment it's like what for so I
mean I started out literally I had a
picture frame and I put a GoPro on top
of it and I set it by that window and I
just started filming myself I had
nothing so I mean as you go on I started
to do it more you start to you know buy
equipment and get a little bit more
professional not that I'm super high
quality but you know you start to get
other stuff so yeah that's what I would
recommend is starting small and then
buying other stuff have you ever gotten
noticed because of your YouTube channel
yes I have and I'll I'm not gonna say
I'm gonna get no tell time by I mean I
do get noticed frequently it's also
because it's like where I live it's like
there's not a lot of like youtubers
around here so it's not like oh like
yeah she's just another I mean if I
lived in LA I feel like I wouldn't get
noticed as much because there's so many
youtubers and there's so much of that
it's like oh yeah she's another youtuber
but here it's not like there's like a
thousand youtubers running around and
yeah so I do get noticed but I don't
know it's weird it's weird to get
noticed because I'm just like I'm so
lame the last question is what advice
would you give someone want to start a
YouTube channel so if you are looking to
start a YouTube channel the first thing
I would recommend is
do it because you want to do it I feel
like a lot of people are a lot of people
try and start a YouTube channel for
different reasons and they want they see
these other youtubers going to like the
Billboard Awards and that kind of thing
and they're like well I wanna you know I
want to do that I wanna look cool I want
to do that in honestly YouTube is not a
matter of looking cool I make videos
because I want to put content out for
people to watch I want to like make
people happy I like fashion
I like editing the videos I get
literally like joy out of editing videos
and you know making it a little cool so
I love that and it's not just about you
know being some famous youtuber that
wasn't even ever a goal of mine when I
started making YouTube was to like have
this many subscribers not that I'm
freakin famous but I didn't think I
would have as many as I do I was just
doing it because so I think it's that's
a number one thing is to do it because
you want to okay my camera cut out so
I'm gonna hurry up and is but the second
thing I would recommend is be yourself
when you're making YouTube videos it's
so cheesy but I think that's what would
really help anyone's channel grow if you
are constantly looking at other
youtubers and constantly trying this it
will dated that so let me try and do
this just like them it's everyone wants
to see your genuine personality you like
people because of their personality not
because of like a fake like thing that
they put on for the camera I remember in
the beginning of me doing YouTube I was
doing videos that you know it was
because other people we're doing them
and I was like oh yeah I want to do this
because they're doing this and it wasn't
because I genuinely wanted to do it now
of course I still do some videos that
other people do but it's because I
actually want to you know like it's me
wanting to make these kinds of videos
and we wanted to put content out for you
guys so that is the big thing be
yourself don't force anything with
YouTube don't be a force that's what you
get from this video that's your number
two tip don't be a force on YouTube
don't try so hard just be yourself
but yeah so I hope you guys like this
video if you guys want to see more q and
A's that are like just one topic like
this was just on YouTube you guys want
to see more cuties like that or just
work you
in general then let me know you can
tweet me see how I plug that in there
yeah so yeah go follow my Twitter ask me
to do more Q&amp;amp;A and I'll do it but don't
follow my Twitter I'm not doing it okay
I'm just kidding anyway my camera is
dying so I will see you guys next hey
