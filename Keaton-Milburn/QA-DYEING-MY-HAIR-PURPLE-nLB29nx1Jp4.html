to be a Q&amp;amp;A and I haven't done this in
forever and I know you guys like these
things these things like I if I don't
know what this is you guys like these q
nays and I actually did one with Hallie
when I was in LA but all of the footage
got deleted and it was really depressing
and it was a really cute video and that
was posed to be like kind of an updated
QA but it's now that it didn't go up I'm
here doing another one so I asked you
guys to ask me questions on Instagram
because that's always easiest for me to
like scroll through the comments so if
you guys wanna phone it into your MLB
event right here and the link is also in
the description I'm gonna start at the
top and like just pick and choose which
ones I want to do oh my god so this
question was asked a lot is what are you
watching on Netflix currently assault
currently I am watching Gossip Girl and
I watch ok I'm watching it with my mom
because I've actually already seen
Gossip Girl I actually watched it when
it was like on TV I watched some of it
on Netflix and then I watched like the
last two seasons on TV and so good it's
my favorite show ever but I haven't seen
it in like two years so I've been one
it's my mom to watch it so we started
watching it and we're on season 3 now we
finished season 2 yesterday favorite
vacation you've ever taken I think my
favorite vacation would probably be
Vancouver and Alaska which was like we
went on our Alaskan like cruise and then
we also were in Vancouver for like a day
and I seriously love that trip so much
like not even just because it was
probably one of the most beautiful
places I've ever been like Alaska was
beautiful Vancouver I'm obsessed with
Vancouver I think I couldn't think
literally live there but I think I just
really liked exercise also with like my
entire family it's a family vacation so
I really really love that this question
is purpose or made in and so I am
obsessed with both albums I am such a
directioner like at like it's so hard to
describe being a fangirl when you're
kind of like older because when I
started being so obsessed with what
I was like way younger and like but it
just carries on with you as you know
like I will never stop like I will love
them too like literally I'm on my
deathbed like I will want to marry Harry
Styles for the rest of my life that's
not even a question but I also am such a
Justin Bieber fans as well I wouldn't
really consider myself like a belieber
because I mean like I and it's so
difficult but I'm such big fans of both
of them so I feel like I would pick
purpose that will purpose over me and
just because I really like what Justin
is like standing for right now I kind of
like the whole thing where he's kind of
figuring this thing out he's finding his
purpose and like I really really am into
that right now I love him so yeah but
Maydan am is such an amazing album and
it's such a different sound and their
other albums
I'm really really obsessed with both of
them but I would probably have two big
purpose I have so many questions asking
if i'm doing vlogmas this year obviously
me posting this video during cosmas
you're like wait you're not doing
vlogmas i am actually doing vlogmas but
because i am in school i am a senior in
high school so since i'm in school till
like december 16th
i think like i don't want to film every
single day and me going to school and me
doing the exact same thing especially
since it's school no one likes school
you already go to your own school you
know that it's miserable and health so
you don't really need to watch me go to
school every single day for 16 days so
would I get out of school
I'm a vlog like one or two days while
I'm at school like at the end of break
or whatever but when I get out of school
is when I'm going to officially start
vlogmas because that's just easiest for
me and especially with finals during
school it's really really hard to
consistently upload daily videos okay
this question is celebrity question
celebrity crushes male and female so my
female celebrity crush would probably
have to be Kylie Jenner which a lot of
people disagree like it's either people
really really things she's like so
perfect like me I'm obsessed with her or
they think she's like the ugliest
kardashian-jenner
whatever I am absolutely obsessed with
her I have been for the longest time
ever so she's probably my celebrity
crush like I mean I really really like
Kylie Jenner this is so random but I
really like Hilary Duff like her life is
goals this is not a question but it says
show us a picture when you were a baby
and I was not a cute baby at all so out
in sort of picture of when I was a baby
and then when I was like a toddler I
guess I was way cuter so I'll put one
here oh that's embarrassing
if you have to pick only one makeup item
what would you choose I would probably
take either mascara I don't I don't I
wouldn't pick a lipstick or anything I
was gonna say lipstick but I really
would not wear just like lipstick and no
other makeup so probably it's mascara or
like stuff for my eyebrows what is your
greatest most memorable experience at
starting YouTube probably like the most
memorable experience in starting YouTube
is beauty Colin I really really loved
beautycon and like actually being able
it was the first time I've ever gone to
anything that was YouTube related that
like I was like set to go to like I
really really enjoyed that so I think
that's the most memorable experience and
starting my youtube but there's just
been a lot of other things that have
been really cool opportunities coming
out of YouTube but I really liked
boutique on a locked favorite bathroom
works that what is backwards favorite
Bath and Body Works holiday candle scent
so I'm just gonna show you guys these
now I'm probably much for them in
another video like a favorites video or
something but I'm gonna show you the
candles that holy
so I wouldn't block Friday shopping and
we stayed there for quite some time but
I literally only bought three candles
from Bath and Body Works and that was it
so I bought twisted peppermint guys it's
ridiculous about twisted peppermint
the tis the season one this woman's like
this one's like more fruity holiday but
it has like a cinnamon kind of scent to
it so it smells good and then I bought
what is this one vanilla bean Noel this
is the one I had last year it's most
kind of different than the one from last
year because I have the one from last
over there but I love this one I love
all three of them I think my favorite
would have to be the twisted peppermint
I have this one last year - I'm
literally buying the same candles but
the twisted peppermint is probably my
favorite holiday like seasonal candle by
the way - I see in my little Christmas
stuff I put it up I have a candle
burning right here and it's radiant red
maple and that is my favorite one for
fall
I just haven't burnt it all the way out
yet and I don't really want to save it
till next year so I'm trying to use it
up but I think I'm gonna start lighting
these Christmas ones soon so radiant red
maple is probably my favorite for fall
and then twisted peppermint from Bath
and Body Works is my favorite Christmas
time would you rather die your hair
bright blue or bright purple I would
probably want to dye my hair bright
purple
I have always literally always wanted to
dye my hair lavender purple like I
literally want to look like a mermaid or
unicorn like my sister wants me to do it
so bad I want my hair to be lavender I
don't know I just like get so tired of
this blonde brown like kind of thing but
I don't think I would ever do it cuz I
don't know how I would get back to my
natural color and that like stresses me
out
so yeah I don't know but if I could I
would die at lavender purple so purple
okay this one is when you're older how
many kids do you want to have and I feel
like this might seem like a lot to some
people but maybe like three or four I
don't know like I it's either like I
literally don't want any kids because
I'm just like so scared I don't want to
give birth like and they just like have
spent like I don't want to have them but
if I have to like have them that's also
evil but like if I work to have them
whatever I would probably want three or
four kids who is your biggest celebrity
of man-crush when you were younger and
who is it now I think that person I was
most obsessed with like when I was like
the younger so you can't really you
don't really know but it was probably
Jesse McCartney because
I have like the biggest poster ever it
covered like the entire back of my door
I had his like face it was like the
cover of his album I think on the back
of my door and I remember just being
like so young but I was so obsessed with
Jesse McCartney and also like Efron
because when High School Musical came
out I was like you've got to be kidding
me like I thought he was the most
beautiful person
so definitely Jesse McCartney first and
then Zac Effron when are going to make a
draw my life video so when I first
started my channel I that's what like I
really found really interesting was
youtubers draw my life videos I watched
Bethenny Moniz I watched Rebecca blocks
like I watched those kind of videos and
they're really interesting like the way
it is and I really wanted to do one but
I hadn't really had my youtube for that
long so I feel like when I'm a little
bit older I want to do a draw my life
because I don't want to do it when I'm
still in high school because I want high
school to be kind of like an older thing
in the draw my life I wanted to be like
I've graduated high school and this is
what I'm doing now like this is my life
so I feel like I'm gonna wait on that
but I definitely want to do one okay and
the last question is if you have the
chance tomorrow for any store or company
what would it be I feel like if I could
model I'll do like both like I feel like
if I would want to model for any store I
don't know why but I am obsessed with
Bob bucks boutiques look books on their
website I know if you've ever looked at
them or anything I'll look like a link
down below so you guys can go click it
I'm obsessed with it and I feel like
doing a lot box boutique like video or
lookbook kind of thing for their website
would be the coolest thing ever
one because I'm obsessed with their
clothes and to just because I love the
style of their look books so that would
be like a store I would not afford and
then like a company kind of something
that I would like really want to do
obviously would be like though like that
would be so amazing like that it would
be like unreal so that is all the
questions that I'm going to be answering
for this video you guys asked me a ton
of questions I know I didn't even like
answer half of them it's so hard when I
have like 7
your questions but a lot of you guys ask
me questions on how I started my YouTube
that kind of thing and then also on like
relationships I've done a relationship
QA which I actually got like a lot of
positive feedback on so I'll link that
down below you guys can go watch that if
you ask me a relationship question maybe
I answered it in that video and then
about the YouTube questions I really
really want to do it like sit-down video
just on my YouTube like all the
questions you guys asked me about my
YouTube how did I start like all that
kind of stuff I want to do an entire
video all about my YouTube channel and
that kind of things so I think I want to
sit down and do that another time if you
guys like actually want to see that and
learn about it comment down below and
just like let me know because you know
feedback is what helps me sorry the
lighting is so awful of this video it's
like so pitch-black dark outside and I
have like weird lighting in here so if

holidays that you guys want to see like
