to be a Q&amp;amp;A and I haven't done this in
forever and I know you guys like these
things these things like I if I don't
know what this is I know you guys like
these q neighs and I actually did one
with Halle when I was in LA but all of
the footage got deleted and it was
really depressing and it was a really
cute video and that was supposed to be
like kind of an updated QA but now that
I didn't go up I'm here doing another
one so i asked you guys to ask me
questions on instagram because that's
always ezio's for me to like scroll
through the comments so if you guys
wanna follow me on instagram i'll leave
it right here and the link is also in
the description i'm gonna start at the
top and like just pick and choose which
ones i want to do oh my god this is like
insane so this question was asked a lot
is what are you watching on Netflix
currently assault currently I am
watching gossip girl and I'm watch okay
I'm watching it with my mom because I've
actually already seen gossip girl I
actually watched it when it was like on
tv I watched some of it on netflix and
then I watched like the last two seasons
on TV and so good it's my favorite show
ever but I haven't seen it in like two
years so Ivan wanted my mom to watch it
so we started watching it and we're on
season three now we finished season two
yesterday favorite vacation you've ever
taken I think my favorite vacation would
probably be Vancouver and Alaska which
was like we went on our Alaskan like
Cruz and then we also were in Vancouver
for like a day and I seriously love that
trip so much like not even just because
it was probably one of the most
beautiful places I've ever been like
Alaska was beautiful vancouver I'm
obsessed with that Cooper I think I
couldn't think literally live there but
i think i just really like text i was
also with like my entire family a family
vacation so i really really love that
but this question is purpose or made in
the am so i am obsessed with both albums
i am such a directioner like at like
it's so hard to describe being a fangirl
when you're kind of like older because
when i started being sold at 10
should I was like way younger and like
but it just carries on with you as you
don't like I will never stop like I will
love them too like literally I'm on my
deathbed like I will want to marry harry
styles for the rest of my life that's
not even a question but i also am such a
justin bieber fan as well I wouldn't
really consider myself like a believer
because I mean like I am it's so
difficult but I'm such big fans of both
of them so i feel like i would pick
purpose i will purpose / min and just
because i really like what justin is
like standing for right now I kind of
like the whole thing where you just kind
of figuring his thing oh he's finding
his purpose and like I really really am
into that right now I love him so yeah
but maiden a.m. is such an amazing album
and it's such a different sound and
their other albums I'm really really
obsessed with both of them but I would
probably have to pick purpose I have so
many questions asking if I'm doing
vlogmas this year obviously me posting
this video during bosma's you're like
wait you're not doing vlogmas I am
actually doing vlogmas but because I am
in school I am a senior in high school
so since I'm in school till like
December 16th I think like I don't want
to film every single day and me going to
school and be doing the exact same thing
especially since it's school no one
likes school you already go to your own
school you know that it's miserable and
hell so you don't really need to watch
me go to school every single day for 16
days so would I get out of school I'm a
vlog like one or two days while I'm at
school like at the end of break whatever
but when i get out of school is when i'm
going to officially start vlogmas
because that's just easiest for me and
especially with finals during school
it's really really hard to consistently
upload daily videos okay this question
is celebrity crush cool washes celebrity
crushes male and female so my female
celebrity crush would probably have to
be kylie jenner which a lot of people
disagree like it's either people really
really things she's like so perfect like
me i'm obsessed with her or they think
she's like the ugliest kardashian-jenner
whatever I am absolutely obsessed with
her I have been for the longest time
ever so she's probably my celebrity
crush like I mean I really really like
Kylie Jenner this is so random but i
really like hilary duff like her life is
goals this is not a question but it says
show us a picture when you were a baby
and i was not a cute baby at all so i'll
insert a picture of when I was a baby
and then when I was like a toddler I
guess I was way cuter so I'll put one
here oh that's embarrassing if you have
to pick only one makeup item what would
you choose I would probably take either
mascara I don't I don't I want to pick a
lipstick writing i was gonna say
lipstick but i really would not wear
just like lipstick and no other makeup
so probably mascara or like stuff for my
eyebrows what is your greatest most
memorable experience at starting YouTube
um probably like the most memorable
experience in starting YouTube is beauty
Colin I really really loved beautycon
and like actually being able it was the
first time I've ever gone to anything
that was YouTube related that like I was
like said to go to like I really really
enjoyed that so I think that's the most
memorable experience and starting my
youtube but there's just been a lot of
other things that have been really cool
opportunities coming out of youtube but
i really liked boutique on a locked
favorite bath in works map what is
backwards favorite bath and body works
holiday candle scent so i'm just going
to show you guys these now i'm probably
gonna show them in another video like a
favorites video or something but i'm
going to show you the candlestick
holders of you so i wouldn't black
friday shopping and we stayed there for
quite some time but I literally only
bought three candles from Bath and Body
Works that was it so i bought twisted
peppermint guys it's ridiculous about
twisted peppermint the tis the season
one this one's like this one's like more
fruity holiday but it has like a
cinnamon kind of scent to it so it
smells good and then i bought
what is this one vanilla bean Noel this
is the one I had last year it's most
kind of different than the one from last
year because I have the one from washer
over there but I love this one I love
all three of them I think my favorite
would have to be the twisted peppermint
I have this one monster too i literally
by the same candles but twisted
peppermint is probably my favorite
holiday like seasonable candle by the
way do i see my little christmas stuff
and put it up I have a candle burning
right here in its radiant red maple and
that is my favorite one for fall I just
haven't burnt it all the way out yet and
I don't really want to save it to make
sure so I'm trying to use it up but i
think i'm going to start lighting these
Christmas ones soon so um radiant red
maple is probably my favorite for fall
and then twisted peppermint from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works is my favorite for like
Christmastime would you rather die your
hair bright blue or bright purple I
would probably want to dye my hair
bright purple I have always literally
always wanted to dye my hair lavender
purple like I literally want to look
like a mermaid or unicorn like my sister
wants me to do it so bad I want my hair
to be lavender I don't know I just like
get so tired of this blonde brown like
kind of thing but I don't think I would
ever do it cuz i don't know how i would
get back to my natural color and that
like stresses me out so yeah I don't
know but if I could I would die and
lavender purple so purple okay this one
is when you're older how many kids do
you want to have and I feel like this
might seem like a lot to some people but
maybe like three or four I don't know
like I it's either like I literally
don't want any kids cuz I'm just like so
scared I don't want to give birth like
and they just like hatch then like I
don't want to have them but if I have to
like have them that's also evil but like
if I work to have them whenever I would
probably want three or four kids who was
your biggest celebrity man crush when
you were younger and who is it now I
think that person I was most obsessed
with like when I was like the younger so
you can't really you don't really know
but it was probably Jesse McCartney
because I
like the biggest poster ever it covered
like the entire back of my door I had
his like face Rob it was like the cover
of his album I think on the back of my
door and I remember just being like so
young but I was so obsessed with jesse
mccartney and also zac efron because
when high school new school came out I
was like you've got to be kidding me
like I thought he was the most beautiful
person so definitely Jesse McCartney
first and then Zac Efron when are going
to make a draw my life video so when i
first started my channel I that's what
like I really found really interesting
was youtubers draw my life videos i
watched Bethany Mona's i watch rebecca
blocks like i watch those kind of videos
and they're really interesting like the
way it is and i really wanted to do one
but I hadn't really had my youtube for
that long so I feel like when I'm a
little bit older I want to do a draw my
life because I don't want to do it when
I'm still in high school because I want
high school to be kind of like an older
thing in the draw my life I wanted to be
like I've graduated high school and the
sort of doing now like this is my life
so I feel like I'm gonna wait on that
but I definitely want to do one okay and
the last question is if you have the
chance tomorrow for any store or company
what would it be I feel like if I could
model I'll do like both like I feel like
if I would want to model for any store I
don't know why but I am obsessed with
Bob box boutiques look books on their
website and if you've ever looked at
them or anything I'll look like a link
down below so you guys can go click it
i'm obsessed with it and I feel like
doing a wot box boutique like video or
lookbook kind of thing for their website
would be the coolest thing ever one
because I'm obsessed with their clothes
and to just because I love the style of
their look books so that would be like a
store i would not afford and then like a
company kind of something that i would
like really want to do obviously would
be like though like that would be so
amazing like that it would be like
unreal so that is all the questions that
i'm going to be answering for this video
you guys asked me a ton of questions I
know I didn't even like answer half of
them it's so hard when I have like seven
hundred questions but a lot of you guys
ask me questions on how I started my
youtube that kind of thing
and then also on like relationships i've
done a relationship QA which i actually
got like a lot of positive feedback on
so i'll link that down below you guys
can go watch that if you ask me a
relationship question maybe I answered
it in that video and then about the
YouTube questions I really really want
to do it like sit down video just on my
youtube like all the questions you guys
asked me about my youtube how did I
start like all that kind of stuff I want
to do an entire video all about my
youtube channel and that kind of thing
so I think I want to sit down and do
that another time if you guys like
actually want to see that and learn
about it comment down below and just
like let me know because you'll feedback
is what helps me sorry the lighting is
so awful with this video it's like so
pitch-black dark outside and I have like
weird lighting in here so if you guys
