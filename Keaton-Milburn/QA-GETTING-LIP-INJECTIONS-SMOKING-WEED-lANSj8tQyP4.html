to be a Q&amp;amp;A and this one asked you guys
to send me questions on my Twitter and
right tumblr and ask me a little bit
more personal questions I want to get a
little in depth with you guys today if
you guys are new here don't forget to
subscribe if you guys like this video
give it a thumbs up you guys like kill
the like button on my last video and I
was like so happy about it you guys like
my videos so if you guys aren't
following me on Twitter I highly suggest
follow me on Twitter I'm tweeting all
the time and that is like for the most
part where I asked you guys to send me
questions it's just like easiest for me
but I did expect to send me some on my
tumblr because a lot of you guys like to
stay anonymous and you guys act like
risque question
so yeah that's we're going to be doing
here have you ever smoked weed no I
haven't never smoked me smoked me
obviously and I would smoke weed Akane
say it I've never even wanted to smoke
weed how did you wreck your mom's shewag
and you never told us so actually this I
wrecked my mom's g wagon on New Year's I
was leaving a wedding and I was honestly
this is going to be like your stupid
kita I was literally having a panic
attack because I was lost in downtown
Houston and I was like freaking out I
was sweating I was like getting to where
I couldn't breathe and like when you're
not focused on driving you just do dumb
things and I rear-ended the car in front
of me and not only did I rear in the car
in front of me seven children got out of
the car I just held up five but seven
children got out of the car and they all
claimed injury so it's a really good
time would you rather suck a dirty toe
or eat someone else's earwax that is
literally so disgusting I would probably
rather like suck someone's chell that
eat earwax for some reason you're just
thinking about it that's making me sick
guys like poop yeah I would rather like
suck someone's toe or something then eat
your wax that makes me literally throw
up but another question is are you
friends with all your exes and I'm
friends with everything one of my exes
except for one because like
just the situation but I'm friends with
everything one of my exes like when I
say friends like I really mean like we
tax every once awhile like have a
birthday Merry Christmas or if I season
post something I'm like oh my god how
like I'm not weird with my exes like
let's be grown here have you ever been
drunk I think this is such a funny
question because of my answer I've never
been drunk before I have never even
drank alcohol which I don't know if a
lot of guys know that but I never have
especially if being in college
everyone's like oh my god you got to
answer you party no I've never been
drunk before I've never had alcohol I
think that i'm already insane as it is
like I'm literally already will be like
I am insane so I feel like if I ever got
drunk it would just not be a good
situation I would just make a really
poor choices so I've never even had the
urge to drink like I've never been to a
party of it like I should get drunk like
I don't think I've ever cared about it
what is the most rebellious crazy thing
you've ever done
probably right life my parents like I've
never done anything where I was like
I've never done anything where I've like
really like broke the law or like stuck
in anywhere I've like lied to my parents
before about like dumb things that make
no sense like going to see a boy or
something but other than that I haven't
done anything really rebellious I don't
think oh my god someone has me if I've
gotten my lists done they said please
answer honestly no I have not got my
lips done but if it looks like I've got
my ribs done and that means I'm doing
something right in the world because I
wish moosh there literally look here
what do you used to whiten your teeth
this is such a ass question like I don't
know why you guys want to know this so
much I use Crest Whitestrips I use them
I don't use them that often but I'll go
through a face I'll use them like every
day for like two weeks and then I stop
for a while because my peeps get kind of
sensitive and then I go back to using
them but that's what I do what is your
biggest and security I would say my
biggest and security like my physical
appearance wise would probably either be
my nose because I don't know why I just
don't like my nose and probably my feet
I just don't like feet in general
all and I don't like my feet I have
really really big hands
I don't mind it because like I don't
ever hold anyone's hand so do you think
any your friends get annoyed having to
take pictures of you yes I'm sure all of
my friends hate taking pictures of me
they probably also take hate taking
pictures with me because I like that
come on let's take a panic laptops on
but yeah I'm sure everyone gets annoyed
Kelsey's probably like the number one
person who gets annoyed because when I
had an Instagram scene which by the way
I dropped my Instagram theme I know it's
a major moment for me but I just always
make healthy go to a white wall and it
was just such a struggle and it was such
a hard time and so yeah she probably
hated that a lot have guys ever not want
to date you because you're waiting till
marriage I don't think a guy has ever
said like oh like you're waiting to
marriage I don't negate you but like if
I tell them I can see it becoming the
kind of a problem because like guys are
guys and that's just what happens but no
one's ever felt like oh I can't date you
like that's what you're like normally
for the most part people are just like
okay like I respect it they just like
get over it would you ever go vegan I
have two betas between going vegan like
since I've in Arizona I've debated it
one because I've been working out a lot
and I think that going vegan helps me
live a healthier lifestyle I know not
all vegans are like greens and
everything I understand that but I think
that if I would be you know what help me
I just really like to delay like I just
really like chick-fil-a
I really like buffalo wings like I don't
know what to do like now that I just
said that I know after I film this video
I'm gonna go get chick-fil-a I should
have said that it's not I'm good at do
you prefer nobody attending your wedding
or nobody attending your funeral dang I
would prefer no one attend my wedding
because at the end of the day my wedding
is like just for me and my husband so if
no one attended it I was like you know
what it's fine I'm still wiped up I
still got a ring on it
but if no one came to my funeral I would
be like I'll be literally looking down
from heaven like I would be so
disappointed like I would be like y'all
are all fake I would see all of them in
their bed and they wouldn't even be at
my funeral and I would be really hurt
though yeah don't come my wedding come
like you
all righty guys that is the end of my
little Q&amp;amp;A I figured I'll just do like
more fun questions and just like
interesting questions because I feel
like I don't talk about all this stuff
