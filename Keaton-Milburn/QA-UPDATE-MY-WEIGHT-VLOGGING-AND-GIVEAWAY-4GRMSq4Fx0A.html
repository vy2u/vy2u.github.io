be a Q&amp;amp;A so today it's gonna be a little
bit different because I've decided that
I wanted to q and A's more often I just
feel like um I just feel like I do a lot
of beauty related videos and I do a lot
of videos like that but I am NOT like as
much as I love doing makeup and hair and
doing all that kind of stuff I'm not
technically like a beauty guru just
because I kind of just put out whatever
I want to put out so I want to do more q
and A's and like be more casual and
stuff like that so I'm gonna be
answering a few questions from you guys
if you watch my what's on my iPhone um I
actually haven't been filming because
I've been sick and stuff that is why my
videos are kind of slow lately by the
way I'm rating these off of my computer
because my phone is being stupid
so um first question what made you want
to start your YouTube I think that I
want to start my YouTube just because I
am a person who talks a lot and I just
feel like I don't know like I had
Instagram followers that grew really
really quickly and then a lot of people
were like you should started YouTube and
I never was really obsessed with YouTube
like I am now until I actually started
making videos so I think the first time
I ever made my videos I was like oh this
is cool and then it just kind of grew
more and so now I just think it's really
fun and it's like a hobby it's something
I like to do so yeah how long have you
been doing YouTube I've been doing been
doing YouTube been on YouTube I really
no I I don't even know I think I started
it like a few years ago but then I quit
like posting videos and so I think it's
been almost a year since I like
restarted making videos on this channel
more frequently reborn in 97 or 98 I was
born in 1997 I was born on August 29th
how tall are you I always get this
question I'm five five I think I get to
this in my last Q&amp;amp;A but I always get it
so I figured I would say it again I
actually want to grow I want to be like
six foot tall I don't know why I just
which I was a lot dollar than I am tips
on starting a YouTube okay so I didn't
really have a ton of tips for you guys
just because I'm kind of new at it too
so we're like on the same page but I
feel like when you're starting in
YouTube it's best to be like like
confident like don't start a YouTube
channel if you're not in the right like
I don't know mindset for it because
people will comment like the stupidest
things on your videos and get mad about
the stupidest things on your videos and
if you're not confident in yourself then
that's really going to bother you but if
you're confident and you know why you're
doing YouTube then it really helps
another tip would be to be yourself and
that sounds so super cheesy but doing
what every other youtuber is doing is
not necessarily the way to go which I
mean I do a lot of videos out a lot of
youtubers do but I want to his videos I
don't feel like I'm being forced to do
those videos the third thing was it's
kind of more technical but I feel like
don't be doing it for the wrong reasons
don't be in this to be making tons of
money and trying to be a YouTube
celebrity and all that kind of stuff
because I feel like I didn't really
start it for that reason but it's easy
to like think that this is all gonna
like lead to that when it might not and
you don't even know like what you're
doing you're just making videos you know
your height and weight I already said my
height my weight I haven't really
weighed myself weighed myself weighed
myself in a while um I think I'm like
120 like average I think that's I think
that's right the reason I'm telling you
that is because I've actually been
working out so I want to let you guys
know my way so in the future I can be
like hey now I'm this much you know when
do you think you'll be putting up a new
makeup tutorial I'm gonna be doing a new
makeup tutorial soon I'm just waiting
because I have like been wanting so much
makeup recently but I am gradually like
getting all my makeup together so once I
figure out like all my stuff and get it
all together like my full makeup routine
is done then I also man I put out
yes just I can't oh my gosh well okay
are you doing more vlogs yes I'm gonna
be doing more vlogs I think I'm gonna be
doing a lot in this summer it's kind of
hard to be doing vlogs during like the
school time whatever but I'm going to LA
from March 8th to the 13th so while I'm
there I'm going to be vlogging a lot and
like showing you guys and if you want to
keep up with any of the other things
that I'm doing right now in my life or
any other stuff you can follow me on
like my social media
what do you add it your videos with I
just used regular iMovie because I have
Mac so that's just easiest for me to use
I do want to switch over to Final Cut
Pro soon because it's like easier and
it's not easier but it's easier to do
cool things with it on iMovie you can
just do basic stuff but I want to be
able to like learn how to edit more and
all that kind of stuff can you do a skin
care routine okay so I was thinking
about doing this for a long time but I'm
not really sure if I want to do one
because my skin care routine is like not
really a skincare routine I just washed
my face off with st. Ives scrub and then
just like wipe it down and link that's
basically it and then I put like maybe a
moisturizer on it I don't really have a
big skincare routine I don't do a bunch
of stuff to it so I would do one but
that's literally all I do what was the
first video you posted the first video I
posted was a Q&amp;amp;A and it was awful it was
like so horrible I hated it um but it's
still of me because they're interested
in like going and watching it but yeah I
was a QA and like office so awful I hate
it
odyo talking about in there turn you up
me what about me and how I should get
all my subscribers gonna be mad if I'm
not focus if those are all the questions
I'm gonna be answering if you have any
other questions that I didn't answer in
this video or in previous q and A's
please go in my tumblr ask me them and I
will put them in my next Q&amp;amp;A I do get a
lot of the same questions so if it's
more of a common question like my hide
or where I'm from or other stuff I did
answer that in my first Q&amp;amp;A so I'll link
that down below
so you guys go check that out okay so
now I would like to talk to you guys
about a giveaway thing that I mentioned
in my last video so I have now decided
that because Valentine's Day is coming
up and we like that what I'd say is the
worst thing that anyone could have ever
created like really if you're giving
single people a reason to want to cry
and just eat chocolate and just I mean
honestly just die and so I I know that I
have a boyfriend right now but at the
same time I have been in a place where I
haven't had a boyfriend I've definitely
been single on Valentine's Day so
instead of doing a giveaway that's like
one person gets one thing or whatever I
wanted to do something that's more like
special I guess so for Valentine's Day I
wanted to pick you guys and I wanted to
be your Valentine so I decided I'm gonna
be picking five people from the comments
below so you guys can comment in the
comments below with the hashtag Keaton
be my Valentine and then comment your
favorite candy um you can comment this
on any of my social media so you comment
on my Instagram you can comment on my
Twitter and then you can also come in it
in the comments below and you'll be
entered to win and so on Valentine's Day
you'll be getting a surprise so if you
would like to enter you can come at that
become let's blow and then like this
video you also must be subscribed to
this channel and following my Instagram
and Twitter but yeah I hope you guys
like this video
