probably one of the weirdest videos I'm
going to make I don't even know how to
like intro it or talk about it if you're
new to this channel hi Keaton thank you
guys so much for subscribing if you guys
want you guys can bald me on its arm and
Twitter maybe not after this video as
might be cooked down you guys might
think I'm really weird but that's that
so if you guys have been watching my
vlogmas which I am still logging by the
way even though vlogmas is over but if
you guys have been watching it every
morning I would show you guys that I had
a sleep talking app and every single
night it would record what I was saying
for a lot of people with my sleep talk
it's just mumbling here and there and
it's just not good like just little
things for me for some reason I have
always slept talk like a conversation my
mom and my sister and my friends and
anyone who has ever had like a sleepover
with me or anything like that has told
me when I sleep talk I will literally
sit up out of bed like I will sit up
like I'm sitting open my eyes and it
looks as if I am awake but I have
absolutely no recollection of what I'm
saying what I'm doing the morning I wake
up I have no idea that I said anything
which is why I started using asleep
talking at because I wanted to figure
out what I was saying when I was
dreaming and I just thought it was
really really weird that I kept having
these conversations with people that
would like sleep over with me and I was
like I don't I don't even remember
having a dream so you guys are really
really a trip with them you guys wanted
me to do a reaction of me listening to
me sleep talking so what I did by the
way I'm not sponsored I wish I was
sponsored by the Sun because if I was I
would be like the ultimate like G at
this app the app is called sleep talk
recorder I will try and link it down
below if I can find it but basically for
like the past 10 days I think I've been
recording me sleep talking but I haven't
listened to any of their recordings yet
so this is gonna be a reaction I'm not
gonna lie to you it is pretty terrifying
listening to myself talk about things
and like talk to somebody and I have no
idea and a lot of people were like oh my
gosh what if you record yourself all
night and you hear someone else's voice
at time
sometimes I listen to the recordings I
don't know if it's like me talking I'm
either changing my voice or there's like
something else I don't know that's a
whole nother story the house that I'm in
now my home that I grew up in I have
always believed was haunted I still
believe it's haunted I actually
literally know for a fact it is haunted
it's not haunted but I know there's
something in this house and that's 100%
whether my mom or my dad or my sister or
anyone else believes me
I know like I can barely sleep in this
house every single night because I'm
like there's something here also I think
the creepiest thing is that I sleep talk
between 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning
which is like the witching hour which is
like I'm not about that life I don't
control when I'm sleep-talking so it's
just really weird to me that every
single time because that has the time
when here it just is weird to me that I
start talking then also sometimes I can
hear my door closing like this is 508 in
the morning and my doors closing that
why why is it doing that who's there
I don't know what
I can't I can't make out what I'm saying
I said right now currently like what are
we doing what are we doing what are you
doing 307 307 is when it starts I'm
Larry sound this recording he was so
ugly so much here now oh my god he was
so ugly who am I talking about
shame I sleep I'm a little early hitting
my pillows I'm slamming my pillows you
could hear me beating
do you see what I'm saying it's like I'm
talking to someone in my sleep but then
I like changed my voice kind of and it
sounds like to people but like it's me
like it was two different voices I'm
coughing honestly when you think about
sleep talking
it is so creepy and scary and it's
honestly so annoying the fact that like
I can't help that I sleep talk like I
have no control over whether I'm talking
my sleeper not like I go to sleep every
night and I wake up in the morning and I
have no idea if I've talked or not and
it's like that's so embarrassing if
you're like with somebody and you're
just talking away and like I can't
control it and I wish I could it's
something I'm like so insecure about
like I never like when I marry it's
gonna be like you're insane and like
that's so embarrassing to me what that
is not even English I have no idea what
I said commute communally wait - baby -
baby
hey it's making everybody
the ghosts in our house mm-hmm what is
her name
Isabella isn't that's innate
right I mean she's real to you know she
I never sell her but really how there's
a ghost of this house and I don't like
what is here anymore a family believes
me I do but I think she's still here I
just think it's not like how it was like
I don't see her like I'm not little you
know so she'll shows herself a little
bit like what all kids aren't more
Rebecca Lucy you're able to see them you
probably love that guy Isabella you need
to be in the videos you could be famous
because you have an Instagram go follow
my little nephew Brady I literally said
brazii in my sleep if you're a blood you
replace every word that starts with the
sea with a B so like instead of saying
crazy you say breezy but like I don't
talk like that
but why did I do that in my sleep why
I'm so like
Hey
why am i laughing like that is so creepy
guys that's so creepy like I hate when I
laugh in my sleep it's so scary why is
my voice so weird why do I sound like
that I'll play a few for you guys
because I feel like I didn't have a lot
of really good ones in this video but I
have a ton more this one I'm saying that
I'm not good at anything I'm like sorry
I'm not good at anything
this one I'm saying I hate myself
this one I'm literally saying I hate
myself in my sleep unfortunately I can
only record when I'm sleep talking when
I'm at home in Texas because when I go
to Arizona at my AC vent that's in my
dorm is so loud that it's just one big
long recording of like and like it's
like you can only hear the AC you can't
hear me I know it's such a reveal but a
lot of you guys are asking me to do this
a lot of you guys wanted me to react to
me in sleep talking it's honestly super
terrifying and I hate that I can't
control it and I also hate that I do it
in this house I'm not Lois Lane I'm not
Haley Reese I don't have some crazy like
paranormal storytime I'm nothing like
crazy is having me I don't have like
bruises on my body I don't have lucid
dreaming I don't have sleep paralysis I
don't have any of that so it's not
technically a paranormal story but when
I was younger I would always see the
same girl in my Hall she was an older
lady and I would tell my mom every
single night I saw her and like she was
super nice it was never like I was
afraid of her I was only afraid of her
because I didn't know like I didn't know
why I could see her I guess I don't know
how to
I sound crazy too like the rest of my
family but like i 100% believe and I
know like what I saw and I know she was
in this house and I know she probably
still is I just think that like when
you're younger kids can always see like
ghosts or like spirits or whatever and
older people can't and that's just how I
look at it so it kind of plays into my
sleep talking the like ghost in my house
and me sleep talking because one night
when I was asleep and I have literally
no recollection of this I do not
remember this whatsoever but one night
when I was asleep my sister and her
friend they were like in high school and
they just thought it was like funny to
mess with me I guess so while I was
sleeping they were like oh keaton like
where's Isabella now like talking to me
while I was asleep and they said I
literally like sat up and pointed and I
was like she's right next to you
in my sleep and I do not remember this I
don't even think I I it's so scary to
think about because like I said that in
my sleep responding to my sister and her
friend like messing with me and like I
just think it's so creepy and I feel
like that's why I'm like so scared in my
city talking because I'm like I don't
know why I say talk I don't and I can't
control it and it's like things like
that that I'm like that is so weird and
so sketchy so yeah I definitely still
believe she's in this house I don't
think she's like me and she doesn't mess
with me there definitely was like a
darker spirit whatever it was it was
like so evil and like I would be so
scared of it and like I'm still very
weirded out by the fact that like it was
in this house like it was just this big
black figure tall it seemed like a man
never saw its face it was just it was
just black like it was just a black
figure I don't eat I don't know how to
describe without sounding crazy and my
parents of my sister and although we're
gonna watch this and be like oh my god
eat and still things but like 100% I
know it was his tall black figure I
would always be on the stairs and it
like it wasn't nice like Isabella I was
not like I wasn't worried about her
because she was more just like in our
house like living like doing whatever I
honestly feel like she was like an angel
or something like I don't think she was
like anything mean but like the black
figure he wasn't nice like if he wasn't
he wasn't nice it
was it nice whatever it was like it just
wasn't like the right energy and like I
was so so scared of it for like I don't
even know why like the only way I can
describe it was just cuz like it wasn't
like it was just like a dark like energy
it's the only way I could describe it
and I sound insane like I get it but
that's how I feel that's what's been in
my home so that's why sleep talking is
so weird to me I hate when I'm laughing
in my sleep I hate what I'm talking my
sleep because I'm terrified that I'm
like talking to Isabella or I'm talking
to whatever the heck was other in the
house like I don't know anyways guys I
