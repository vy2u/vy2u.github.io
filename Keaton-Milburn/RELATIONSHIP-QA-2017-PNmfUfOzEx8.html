be a relationship QA and it's going to
be obviously very very casual has some
some coffee I'm sitting on my bed I'm
literally in pajamas I have no makeup on
and I feel like to sit and chat with you
guys because I feel like when I'm like
talking about like boys and
relationships I feel like I'm talking to
my friends and we're like having a
little sleepover so that's what I want
to do I just want to sit in my bed in my
pajamas and drink some coffee and I want
to talk to you guys about your
relationships and your boys and our
non-existent relationships that we don't
have so hope that's remove you today I
asked you guys to please send me
questions on my tumblr because you can
send them anonymously I know not a lot
of you guys want to like send your
person on probation me on Twitter so I
tweeted you guys if you guys don't
follow me on Twitter go follow me
because I'm always tweeting stuff about
like new videos and q and A's and stuff
like that you guys will always be like
the first to know because I always will
tweet it first
I mean Fabiana is here too I promise I
looked here within this like on
Instagram I really don't look like this
all the time so let's just get into the
collections and the first and most asked
question is how to get over an ex and
this is like literally all in my inbox
like you guys ask me so many questions
about this for me personally obviously I
don't think it matters how long day to
someone I don't think if you guys did it
for years or you guys dated for a month
I do not think it matters at all how
long it takes you go over an ex like it
on it like it really doesn't matter you
can like be in love with someone in like
a week like I understand I feel you guys
the best way for me to get over an ex
was to really focus on myself and that's
what like helped me a lot going through
like a bad breakup or any breakup
honestly I think that just like
listening to good music that makes you
feel positive I think that focusing on
yourself just like not moping around I
feel like a lot of people once they're
like which I mean I did this at first as
well but I feel like a lot of people
once they like our relationships or like
what do I do now we're laying out with
what do I do and like for me I also know
personally not every relationship and
I'm not talking about this as an abusive
relationship but honestly when your
interrelationships most of the time you
spend with your boyfriend and you have
somewhat limitations on like hang out
with your friends you don't hang out
with your friends as often and that's
just a given when you're in
tip so when I was getting over load max
I was like you know what I'm going to
take this time to like be with my
girlfriend be with my family and like
focus on like what makes me the happiest
because you can't put all your happiness
in one person especially not like your
boyfriend because honestly unless there
is a ring on your finger and you guys
are married then they're not going to be
there forever you can't always like rely
on that one person you can't rely on
them to do everything for you and be
there for you all the time because I
mean the truth is people are shady to
some shady people in the world not
always going to be there how is it dump
someone nicely I think this is the
funniest question because there is no
way to dump someone nicely guys like
literally a sheep so I feel like
honestly it is almost harder to dump
someone than it is to be broken up with
like it sucks to like get out of a ship
and broken up with but like a week later
you're like I know who I am like I'm
cute I'm fine whatever but dumping
someone it's like you feel so bad
because you know that you're hurting
them and you like don't want to like I
don't know it just makes me like sad so
honestly there's no real way to dump
someone I would say the only thing I
would give it advice you're breaking up
with someone is be as honest as possible
because if you guys are like giving like
some random excuse as to why I do bring
up like oh I don't know I just like not
doing it right now when really it's like
they're so rude and they're so annoying
like tell them like this is how you
treat me don't treat me well like just
be honest because in the long run it'll
come back to you like well you like
didn't even break up with me for the
right reason you know what I'm saying I
just feel like I can breaking up with
someone be as honest as possible because
it will really it'll come back for you
I'm not allowed to date until I'm 16 I'm
15 but I'm talking to this guy and he
has been dropping hints about hanging
out and stuff but how can I tell him
that I can't date or hang out until 16 I
was up the same way I was an architect's
boys for the longest I was allowed to
date till I was like literally in high
school and even in high school like kind
of like doing even a new one but I feel
like honestly just tell them there's so
many people that I remember like when I
was in like seventh eighth grade I would
be like sorry like I can't really text
boys right now or like I can't really
talk to you right now
and like the guys who were just like
okay like it's fine we can just these
friends like those are the ones like
there's a real like they're the realm VP
like right there and honestly there's so
many guys that's been okay I don't want
to do there's something else but there
are like a few guys that like a long
time ago like oh I can't date like my
parents they'll be dating my parents
don't want me texting boys whatever
they're like okay and then like years
later once on a real date it's like they
still are interested on you I feel like
that means they're really interested if
it's just like a little fling and
they're just trying to like hang out and
do whatever it's better for you to just
tell them that you can't talk now know
how to start talking to a guy you don't
really know okay I feel like this is the
question a lot of people ask I feel like
the easiest way in any relationship is
probably being friends with them first
thing's friends with a guy before you
guys actually start dating is always
easiest because you don't know like
their past you don't know what they've
been especially for me and college you
and Mike high school I guess if you're
meeting someone from like another school
or somewhere you don't know like what
they've done in populations and stuff so
I always think it's best to build that
friendship up and kind of figure out
their personality and then you can see
if you want to date and you just start
talking to someone right away and then
you guys like I'm gonna go with some
cute like two months and then like a
month later you find out like that you
don't like just crazy stuff that is
always like the worst and then just
leaves being super awkward so being
friends with someone is always easiest
and because you can always go back to
that friendship if it doesn't work out I
just realized that didn't really answer
the question about heart start talking
to guys but I heart talking to guys
would be to be friends with them first
and probably to get your friends to
introduce you to them I'm always in like
a big group and like them with all that
guy so cute in my friend's life
Colombian - dude I'm like okay you like
that's a bit okay so that's what I would
do everyone is probably asking advice
for their love life but how is your life
loveless going anyone special no it is
Saturday at 12 o'clock during the day
and I'm sitting in my bed talking to you
guys so so my love life is going I
really like this question is how do you
survive in a society where sex is valued
I'm not ready for and I'm saving myself
for marriage so what should I do to not
seem like a prude so I really like this
question just because that is something
that I really value a lot is saving
yourself emerge and that's just my
personal belief like that's just what I
to do with like my body whatever any of
you guys want to do with yours is fine
but for me that's what I believe and I
do think just a bit harder especially
meeting other people when everything one
of your friends is like having sex or
they're doing stuff and you like don't
really want to and they may not even be
that you want to save yourself a
marriage it may just be like you're not
ready and that's totally okay I dated
someone for two years and we literally
never did anything like not a single
thing so I really don't think that that
has anything to do with anyone who tells
you like you don't have as good as a
relationship because you guys haven't
had sex I don't think that's right at
all to not seem like a prude I don't
think that you guys I don't think that
fruit is the right word because you'll
have sex like I don't think that that's
true I know a lot of people say that and
they're like oh my god like she said to
cruise doesn't do anything but honestly
you're not approved that's this way you
don't it's just what you want to do you
don't have sex you want to set up to you
but I don't think you're approved
because you don't want to do stuff I
think that you're yourself because you
don't do stuff like that's all if a guy
talks a lot about you to his friends
does that mean he likes you
depends on what you say the guy's like
talking like oh my god like it doesn't
reach it ends always saying obviously
you saying they grew things to like girl
they'll be talking to him like you don't
need them in your life but I mean if a
guy's like mentioning you this friend
and he's like oh yeah like she's cute
like oh yeah I went hang out there you
probably it it's like someone interested
in you and I don't think guys have to be
the first one to make the first move you
can go up to them or you can get their
number and you can text and you guys can
just hang out also I don't think that
everything needs to be like such a date
like you guys don't have to like go to
some fancy dinner be like oh my god like
we're on a date you guys can literally
like go bowling go to the movies hang
out in the friend group and like go to a
party like do something that is just
like you guys getting to know each other
first before you guys start going on
like real dates like one-on-one going to
eat together that's what I would suggest
I just went through a breakup and I was
really cool with it have you ever been
through something like that because now
I'm questioning it all like I did love
him etc it just feels weird to be truly
okay when it was a breakup so I
definitely can relate to this and
this is this isn't always about things
sometimes you can be in our Lacey for a
while and then you got you know like in
your heart like like I just don't think
this is going to work I just need to end
it you know what's better for you so you
just ended it like you're just like okay
you know what we need not it's okay it
can be fine after a breakup like for a
second you're going to be like wait why
am I still okay right now like I should
be like so sad but not everyone is sad
after breakups sometimes it was just
something we needed to go through and
then you're like okay and I've been at
work it's fine so I don't think you
should second-guess yourself just
because you're feeling okay after a
breakup it's totally fine for you to
feel better after a breakup I mean like
I know I have like multiplied
why are you not currently and
relationship you're so pretty
that's Harry Styles asking well I'm not
a relationship how you keep your faith
and be patient enough to wait for the
guy got it sending for you I've been
struggling with this a lot lately I feel
like anyone and then again it just
doesn't really relate to you guys aren't
as religious or anything but I feel like
being like a Christian and even like
having that baby was like it is so hard
because you always cheer like stories
about like yeah like he's just perfect
for me like God put it in my life for a
reason you're like I really want that
like I really like God like send me
someone now to like be in my life and
like give me Buddha please Lord like
help me which I understand it's super
hard to wait for that relationship when
you know like God's got your back he
always does I always try and put it back
on like you know what maybe this is my
time to focus on like my relationship
with God like maybe me and not being in
a relationship is because he wants me to
focus on relationship with him and so
that's what I try and do to help me I'm
just like okay you know what like my
relationship status it's like what's the
Lord right now right it is not with any
boy like it's not asbestos not what I
need right now anyways guys that is the
end of this video I hope you guys liked
it I know I was a little bit different
I'm just like super casual I have like
no makeup but I'm just like straight
chillin right now but I really did just
want to sit down because you guys have
been asking me a ton of questions also I
have been using snapchat so so much
