gonna come up here okay I have my dog
with me while I'm filming
oh yeah she's disgusting okay so today's
video quit moving I'm going to kill you
so today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A
obviously by the title of this and I
want to do a Q&amp;amp;A because I get tons and
tons of questions and I want to do these
more frequently I know I said that last
time and that was like a year ago or
something not really but you know what I
mean and I get a lot of questions I
really didn't think I would so I asked
you guys to ask me questions on tumblr
about relationships or anything like
that anything revolving a relationship
it can be like with your boyfriend or it
can be like with a friend or it can be
like faith wise anything like that I
want you guys to ask me so I can answer
them on a video and I felt like this
would be more fun because I normally
answer questions that are about me and I
don't really like doing that like I feel
uncomfortable doing that when it's like
hey what's your favorite color what do
you like to show up but I don't know I
just I just feel like there's there's no
point so if you aren't following my
tumblr that is where I get all my
questions you guys can go click it down
below or whatever I'll link it I'm just
gonna start with the most asked question
I've had in the past month and that is
are you and Landon still together no we
are not together anymore I know I look
like I'm like smiling while I'm saying
this but it's better than frowning while
I'm saying this but no we aren't
together anymore and no I'm not going to
explain why we aren't together anymore
because I feel like that's between me
and him and I don't want you guys to
like worry about it because it's like
our thing and stuff so don't be sad or
tweet him anymore or tweet me anymore
about it because I'm saying it now so
you guys know that that is what's
happened and yeah that's basically it
okay how did you learn to be open with
your boyfriend I have I have issues
letting my guard down with any guy I
talked to um I feel like it wasn't as
big a deal for me because I knew Landon
for so long so it was like I don't know
I didn't really feel uncomfortable but
at the same time it just depends on how
well you know them I think sometimes
it's hard to open up to people but like
when you're around them for so long and
you
have someone there for you that you like
want to talk to you like it's not as
hard I think you just need to open up
and I'm not saying completely let your
guard down because I wouldn't personally
do that and I don't personally do that
with anyone that I meet but it is okay
to share some things if you're feeling
sad or feeling upset it's okay to say
those things but then don't like dwell
on it because that's not fun either I
feel like this is a frequently asked
question and I ask and it is how do you
make boys like you and I feel like girls
think that that's something that you can
do but you can't do that you can't make
any guy really like you I think they
just have to like you to like you but
traits that guys like I can tell you
that that might help you um it's good to
be confident like you have to be
confident yourself if you're not
confident yourself then like that's just
I feel like that's a turn-off for every
guy if you're like always complaining
about like your weight or your looks or
whatever like you just need to embrace
like you and guys will think that is so
attractive another thing is to be
outgoing I guess not an outgoing as in
if you're shy that's not cute because
that's not true but into just like be
yourself and if you have an opinion then
share your opinion if you like certain
things then don't like those certain
things don't be constricted and like
feel like you can't share those things
with like a guy or like someone you're
talking to because I feel like guys find
that attractive
if girls have something that they like
to do or like they'll have a hobby if
you're doing nothing all the time and
you just like complain about not doing
nothing but then you don't do anything I
feel like guys find that kind of
annoying because guys just do whatever
they want so it's kind of annoying for
girls to like sit around and complain
about things but they don't do anything
about it just be confident and I have
something that you're interested in and
share it with them and be outgoing and
show what you like and I feel like
that's more attractive what age did you
have your first kiss and is it okay to
have it when you're really old I don't
really know where you're seeing by like
really old I don't really think it
matters but I had mine I think
when I was 16 I think when I was six it
was my freshman year wasn't my freshman
year yes it was my freshman year um and
I remember like all my friends like had
their first kiss like way before me or
it felt like way before me it probably
wasn't but it's honestly not a big deal
and I thought it was such a big deal um
it really isn't so I don't only think it
matters whether you have it if you're 16
or if you're like 19 like it really
doesn't matter like it's not that big of
a deal if you don't have anyone that you
want to kiss then it doesn't matter I
need some ideas of what to do as my
boyfriend that are out of the house so I
feel like people always do this they
like make plans and then it like never
happened and then you just end up
hanging at home and like doing nothing
um some things that you can do are basic
like go to the movies or go to the park
if you have a dog go walk your dog it's
fun to just like walk around outside and
like talk um go eat lunch somewhere
that's really pretty you can go on a car
drive Lutz kart drive car drive because
I need to make sense I don't know go
drive around go talk go like look at new
places I don't know there's lots of
things you can do it depends on also
where you live if you live in a city or
if you live like in a smaller town it
just kind of depends well there's lots
of things you can do besides sitting at
home and watching movies because that's
not always that fun
my boyfriend and I have been dating for
almost a year now and on his 16th
birthday
I just turned 16 he wants to have sex
and I don't but he does but he does and
he has waited so long it is okay for you
to not want to have sex I don't really
think that you should feel pressured
into doing it and if he really really
wants to do it and you don't want to do
it then he should be comfortable with
you saying hey I don't really think I'm
comfortable with doing that I don't
think I'm ready to do that yet so that's
totally up to you it's up to where you
are cuz going into something going into
anything whether it be like sex or like
anything else going into anything when
you're not ready for is always a really
big mistake I would just tell him and be
like hey I'm not really comfortable with
this and if he really really cares about
you and if he understands and I think
he'll be like okay like
I get it and that's basically it how
would you approach someone that you
found attractive like what are your
pickup lines um I don't have pickup
lines you put it in quotes so I know
you're kidding but uh I'm trying to
think if I see anyone that's attractive
I probably don't talk to them like I'm
probably like super awkward or I
probably look super awkward if they're
kind of like a mutual friend that I
guess you can like go in their friend
group or like make up on contact you can
like make eye contact for like a really
long time and then they're gonna be like
why are you looking at me and they can
be like you're hot and then they're
gonna be like you too and then you're
gonna date I don't I don't know I think
you just need to like put yourself out
there like don't be shy but don't use a
pick-up line either that's really weird
what is your opinion opinion on
friends-with-benefits I'm 17 and I have
trust issues so I can't let myself
I can't let myself date because even my
friends have broke my trust so many
times so why would a guy be any
different um I feel like I have never
had like a friend with benefits I don't
really know how that whole thing works
but I feel like it's not a great
situation to put yourself in because I
feel like at some point you're gonna get
attached to them and then it's just
gonna be awkward if you guys stop
talking and if you have trust issues
then I mean like you don't need to be in
their relationship you're gonna you're
gonna not trust the person you're with
either way if you have those issues or
if you have a hard time trusting people
that's just a personal thing that like
you need to work on and like fix and
there's gonna be someone out there that
you're gonna have fun like full trust in
and whether that be the guy that you're
having friends with benefits or whatever
um I don't know I feel like that's not a
great situation for you or something how
do you find a guy that is worth your
love um that's a good question
that's a good question finding a guy
that is worth your love and your
attention and all of that is I mean it's
a hard thing to do and there's always
gonna be like someone that has like
everything except for like one thing
we're like they mess up or something and
that is like what's gonna make it for
you it's sometimes you can compromise on
things and sometimes you just know like
hey this isn't really gonna work and
maybe like we were mistaken like I don't
really think this is gonna work out so
for you I think it's just you need to
find someone that you guys can
compromise on and meet in the middle and
you guys both know that you're fully
there like for a relationship and I
don't know you trust that person and
that's how you know like that's the guy
for you again I'm single so I don't
really know and I don't know how'd you
get out or else I wouldn't be single
right now but that's all you guys I can
give you
hey I'm 17 I've never had a boyfriend I
know they aren't the most important
thing but all my friends are literally
and three-year relationships and it
really messes up my confidence how do
you go about not thinking I'm forever
alone by the way I love you and I wanna
see one of you by the way I love you
honestly the whole forever alone thing
and growing up with cads and as funny as
it is and it's jokes and everything like
that is not gonna happen like there's
going to be someone out there for you
that fits you perfectly and you're not
gonna be single forever forever further
Wow mess up the moment but I mean all
your friends might now but I can't even
speak all your friends right now might
be in relationship tonight that might be
great their relationships might be great
but you're waiting for someone better
and someone better is gonna come along
and whether you're 17 when you get your
voice board oh I hate myself I hate
myself
whether you're 17 when you get your
first first one whether you're 17 will
you get your first boyfriend or you're
like 25 when you get first your first
boyfriend it doesn't matter because
eventually you're gonna find the right
person for you and whether or not like
you started dating and you've had so
much experience like it doesn't matter
because if they're the right person for
you then it's gonna work out in the end
I don't know how to wear this and
honestly but how did you get your
boyfriend to understand you want to save
yourself for marriage I think this is
like kind of a hard topic for some
people and their relationships to
discuss but I mean for me personally my
relationship we were both on the same
page so it's not as hard you guys have
the same beliefs and the same morals and
everything so just saying that and I
also think it comes with confidence if
that's what you truly want to do and you
guys you want to save yourself for
marriage whether he want to or not if
that's what you want to do you need to
set that standard for yourself and then
later on in the relationship like it'll
play out if they end up not having the
same things as you and they're
pressuring you to do other things then I
mean I feel like it's more confusing if
you're not telling them if you're not
tying them then you're kind of just like
like moving around and like kind of like
avoiding the topic maybe just get it out
there and are like hey I'm not having
sex till marriage and that's what I'm
saying then like they know and then if
they disrespect that then you really
know like where you are in your
relationship have you ever had issues
trusting your boyfriend and if you did
how would you handle these issues and
get a lot of questions on trust and I
really didn't have any problem trusting
I don't really have a problem trusting
other people I think that's just like I
don't know I just don't I just don't
really care you know like I trust you
and if you ruin my trust then that's
your problem that's not mine like I
didn't do anything and I think that's
kind of the way people need to look at
it because you can't put it's not your
fault that someone broke your trust you
know I'm saying so I think that's just
the best way to handle it you trust
someone with all your heart then you're
doing what you believe in and if they
break your trust then like that's their
problem you know what I'm saying
the last question is how do you get over
a breakup I think it just depends on you
and like how your relationship was I
guess it just depends on how it ended
also and I don't know it just takes time
that's different for everyone and some
people take a lot longer and that's okay
if it's taking you a long time to get
over someone then it's okay because
y'all dated and y'all had a relationship
and now it's over and it's hard but you
day by day and know that like things are
going to get better and it is not the
end of the world like you're going to be
okay I promise but I have made a breakup
playlist because I'm super weird and I
love music and I like making playlists
are just really fun for me so I'm gonna
list in the description the playlist
that I have made that I have been
listening to so much recently so I'm
gonna leave that for you guys down below
and if you're going through a breakup or
maybe you just want to get my playlist
it's a pretty good playlist not gonna
lie but um you guys can go check it out
check it out check it out down below and
I'll leave that there for you guys I
think that's all for the relationship
questions if you guys have any other
questions I think I'm gonna do different
kind of questions every single time I do
a QA but you guys need to follow my
tumblr because that is where I post and
I say hey my next Q&amp;amp;A is on this and so
