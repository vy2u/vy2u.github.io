hi guys so for the first outfit we went
to the Golden Gate Bridge and I just
felt like this outfit was so comfortable
for everything we did this day so the
jacket is just a yellow cropped jean
jacket from PacSun with a bodysuit
underneath it the jeans are so
comfortable that from Urban Outfitters
are just ripped denim up the bodysuit is
from princess Polly and then I paired it
with a Gucci belt and some vans so it's
like dressy but then I also made it
super casual with like the cutoff jean
jacket and the vans cuz I really loved
the way the body suit looked with
everything and like the belt but I
wanted it to also be comfortable so I
feel like this outfit was perfect and
then I wore some hoops and my sunglasses
are from Urban Outfitters so that was
the first outfit
so the second day it was so fun it was
so beautiful link to this farmers market
and we went to the Ferry Building and
got to see so many things like that and
we also went to a flower conservatory so
that's where I'm walking through now so
this day I actually wear a wig so that's
what my hair is like a long bob but I
wanted to do a really fun outfit with
the color blocking that makes sense so
actually my head wrap is from Lulu's
comets Vanessa Mooney and then I'm
wearing this oversized like sweatshirt
kind of it is from brandy melville it's
just green and then I'm wore eight Urban
Outfitters romper underneath it just
because I really like to color blue but
I liked them being shorts I didn't want
to wear a romper and then I wore with
the same bands that I wore literally the
whole trip so I just really really love
this outfit because I want to try
something different with my hair and the
color blocking and everything and I feel
like it looked really good with like the
flower conservatory theme so yeah so
this next day I wanted to do something
super cute and kind of like boat and
like adventure if that makes sense we
went to muir woods which was beautiful
the trees were like so insane so this
day I wore the same yellow glasses that
I've been wearing all week I wore this
top from be Dumoulin it says live wild
on I thought it was so cute paired with
the pants the pants are brandy they're
just like blue and white striped with my
bands I want every day and then the
sweater I am obsessed with it's from
urban and it is so comfortable and so
warm especially because we were like
outside all day and we were exploring
this cute little town and it was like
Wendy but it was also like cute and
casual which I feel like that's what I
went with like most of my outfits and
then I wore it with some gold hoops that
I absolutely love and urban you'll see a
close-up of them later because we went
out that night but this is the outfit
super fun super like boat casuals so
yeah so later that night we went to a
really pretty dinner at Cliff House so
we watched the sunset and stuff so I
made a quick outfit change I really just
want to do something simple and I bought
that he's really busy boots and you guys
will see but I really wanted to pair
them with an outfit so I'm just wearing
these gold hoops which you can see
closer now they are so cute they're from
urban and then I wore a bunch of gold
necklaces over top of my black
turtleneck which is from Brandi I'll
link all the necklaces down below cuz
summer from urban some are from
forever21 things like that and then
we're Topshop jeans in the style Jamie a
lot of you guys always ask me my style
and then these are the boots so I bought
these at the Louie Vuitton store when I
was in San Francisco because I have been
wanting them for so long and I just
think they're so fun to style so I wore
these obviously any statement boot would
like look cute with this outfit but I
really wanted to wear this so that is
what I wore to dinner so for the last
day we went to Alcatraz and stuff like
that but I didn't film outside at
Alcatraz I thought that was like a
little bit weird so we went to this
bakery and it's called mr. Holmes big
house so cute the sign of so adorable
and they have so many good stuff so that
what I wore today is this turtleneck
underneath this long sweater so the
turtleneck is brandy is just great and
then this sweater is from Zara and then
I wore my checkered bands because I
wanted to do like a whole black and
white thing today yeah okay I'm cheesy
anyway and then I got this black denim
skirt I think this is from princess
Holly as well and then the glasses are
from Urban Outfitters they're more like
cat eye shape but I just thought it was
super cool to wear for this day and that
is the final object
