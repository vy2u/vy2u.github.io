what's up guys oh my voice just cracked
like first off as you can tell I am
filming with a new camera I will explain
that later on I just want to say I'm so
sorry from the bottom of my heart for
not posting a YouTube video in like
three or four weeks I can't explain
myself I haven't really really stressed
out with schoolwork so we'll just start
it up for me so it's just been a really
really stressful I'm taking hard classes
and I'm a junior and I have a lot of
stuff on my plate and just all this
other stuff that is just stressing me
out and I haven't had time to make a
youtube video and every week I'm like
okay I'm gonna film this day and then
I'm like okay I gotta go home on film
and then something comes up it just
seems cuz I had a lot of fun videos
playing for you guys but we're gonna
keep going with them and I'm just gonna
try and post as often as I can so
anyways this week's video is going to be
August favorites even though it's like
almost the end of September first off is
the makeup and beauty products I've been
loving this month so my first Beauty
favorite is this unique unique unique
whatever is called mascara that you can
order it online I'll leave the link in
my description but it's basically just
this little fiber eyelash thing and I
will explain so what you do is you put
your regular mascara coat on your
eyelashes and then you take this natural
fibers to would struck natural fibers
and it's literally fiber so that goes
literally fuzz this is not of our scarab
brush with all my dogs are barking you
take this fiber mascara brush and you
put it on your eyelashes over your
regular mascara that you already put on
and once that is there you
this other one it comes in a set of two
you take this other one it is the
transplanting gel so what it does is it
makes the fibers stick to your eyelashes
so it makes them really really long and
it works amazingly well so I'm really
really like this product next product is
this MAC lipstick and it is in the color
yeah yeah yeah SH and it's matte cuz I
really only wear matte lipstick I don't
work glossy kind oh my god with my dog
please shut up it's just this little
brown looking mascara I just said
mascara this is a Brown looking little
matte lipstick and I got it at mag and
it's kind of I don't know if you can
tell but it's kind of like a pinkish
color but it's mainly brown I thought it
was more pink when I bought it and then
it wasn't and then I came home and it
was brown but turns out I really really
like this color so it's okay I don't
really get my next Beauty favorite is
this Kevin Murphy born again mask so
basically I've got my hair dyed so many
times recently I don't know if you can
tell that my hair is different I don't I
don't know so I went to get my hair dyed
ombre and they messed it all up and it
was atrocious and so I went to this
amazing guy his name is Eric and he did
my hair and fixed it and then I he was
like you need treatment because my hair
had been dyed like three times in the
past two days and that's just really
really bad for your hair so oh my god
these blonde noise I'm going to kill
them
who is this is just a mask for like
damaged hair and whatnot if you have I
don't know bad hair and just put it in
your hair and then you can just shave
your legs or wash your body or whatever
leave it in for 10 minutes in the shower
and then rinse it out and it really
makes your hair really
and I loved it and it just makes me feel
like I'm cleansing my hair of drugs okay
so the next favorite is my camera it was
my birthday on August 29th and my
birthday I got this camera that I'm
filming with but I'm just gonna show you
the little packaging oh okay this is the
camera that I have I have a Nikon d50
300 and a few other things with it I got
this lens it's Nikon lens and it's a 50
millimeter lens and then I also got this
lens this is the 18 240 millimeter lens
and I got this and this is really cool I
really like these lenses the next random
favorite is if the One Direction concert
that I went to let me just tell you guys
the most amazing concert I died guys I
literally lost my mind
the reason I'm including this is because
when I was at the One Direction concert
there was two girls and they said hi to
me and they like shouted my name from
like afar and I was walking to my seats
and I said hey but I didn't like go like
talk to them which I totally should have
done and if you're watching this video
and you are those two girls comment in
the comments below or comment on my
pictures saying like yo that was me I
was at the concert like hello and I
would love to know how you were cuz like
that was so cool for me that was awesome
okay so I'm just gonna get right into
music because I have so much to tell you
guys so the first song would be shake it
off by Taylor Swift can we just talk
about this real quick that song is like
the best song ever I let's do it every
single morning and the music video guys
the music video was so cute I'm gonna
leave the link in the description below
so you guys can go watch it because it's
honestly so cute even though our really
really dislike obviously we're going to
talk about all about that bass by Meghan
Trainor I think that
your name that's song like if you don't
like that song like something's wrong
because first of all it's sitting a
great message second of all like just
like the beat of it in like the lyrics
and her voice is just so good
Shawn Mendes came out the EP and it's
awesome and it's beautiful and he's
beautiful and his voice is beautiful and
each go get it
next song is this is how we do by Katy
Perry and that song is also like all
about that bass like that song is just
like I have to sing it like any time it
comes on the radar like I'm never tired
of it like I will listen to that
non-stop all day Riptide by Vance joy
and it's awesome it's really folky and
like alternative and like cute and like
up be the same time I don't know it's
just like everything that a song really
needs to be so that's kind of like the
theme song of my life at the moment last
music I'm going to be talking about is
Ariana Grande's new album and let me
just tell you there are two albums in
the entire world that I could listen to
non-stop over and over again and never
get sick of the first album would be Ed
Sheeran's album there is not a song on
that album that is bad like every single
song is amazing and then Erina Grande's
last album yours truly that album was
just the most amazing thing I listened
to it for weeks and weeks and weeks and
I could play it in the car every single
day never get sick of it
Erin and Grande was saying on every
single interview that this album was her
favorite I will him so much rather than
yours truly and I was like I don't know
how that's gonna happen because yours
truly was like the most amazing thing to
me but this album guys guys it's the
best best album I've ever heard it's
amazing my favorite song would have to
be be my baby and I love the best
mistake with Big Sean which is
apparently her new like boyfriend
whatever but the whole album is just
amazing and I'm obsessed with it this is
actually a band that I've been wanting
to tell you guys about for quite awhile

Instagram and I checked him out and I
thought I really really liked them they
have a really good I don't know how to
