all out of focus so hopefully focuses my
piece oh oh no you want to focus what's
up guys today's video is going to be a
makeup huh obviously by the title of
this video oh my god my fans on so if
you guys didn't know my birthday was
actually August 29th and with my
birthday I got a ton of Sephora gift
cards so I went to Sephora and I also
went to Ulta
and Mac and all these other places and I
bought a bunch of makeup and I figured I
would show you guys because like make a
pulse or fun and I love watching makeup
balls so let's just do this so the first
thing that I got I actually got like for
my birthday which is the zoeva brushes
and this is just like a set so it's face
and eye brushes so I'm gonna show you
guys what's in this first of all comes
in the cutest packaging like a little
rose gold saying this is the rose gold
like makeup set or whatever so that's
why so I'll show you that I brushes
Burgers
this one is just a little like a
blending brush I love this I really
really needed a good blending brush oh
there's stuff on me and everything
really needed a good blending brush so I
absolutely love this for that and then
this is a smudgy brush which I've never
had before I always like use like a
bigger brush try and like some budget
and then it just looks crappy so I'm
really happy I have this like smudger
brush and then this is for like smaller
applications like onto my eye like in
the crease and stuff like that and then
this is for like the full eye lid this I
know Emily's can put like fix+ on and
like put like all over the foot why did
I say that this I can put like all over
the crease of like my eyebrow I mean the
crease of my eyebrow now I can't speak
today I can't even function this I can
use as a eyeliner brush I don't actually
use I don't actually use gel eyeliner I
use like like little like pin eyeliner
thing but you can use this as eyeliner
or you can use it for like your eyebrow
or something I don't know if you have
eyebrow brush but these are the eye
brushes that it comes with and like
they're so cute
pink and then they have like little rose
gold things like that this is the blush
brush and this has like a bunch of
labels on it whatever but I'm obsessed
with this I love the application this
gives me so much better than my last
blush brush and then this is my second
favorite like brush and the entire world
of this one I use to contour my cheeks
so you guys can kind of see wow my
contour looks hella dark in this
lighting swear doesn't look like that
but this reminds me of the NARS brush
that is like like flat just like this
and it works literally so amazing I'm
obsessed with this like the first time I
put it on I was like oh my gosh this is
heaven so obsessed with this my first
favourite brush would be wide to take
this whole thing off
and it would be this brush and this one
I used to put my foundation on so like I
just put my like little foundation on my
hand and then I just put all over my
face I'm obsessed with it because I
don't know it just applies it so much
better I love my Tarte like foundation
brush but I think I'm gonna use it more
for like when I'm not applying so much
makeup on my face like this is good if
I'm like doing like a full glam I don't
know I just really really love this and
the way it goes on my face so these are
all the brushes I'm obsessed with them I
will link them down below if you guys
would like to check them out and yeah
that's basically it so next I went to
Mac and I only got two things that Mac
because I didn't actually have like a
gift card to Mac like Sephora doesn't
have Mac or whatever so I didn't
actually have a gift card to Mac but I
want to go there buy it so I bought the
fix+ and this I'm actually obsessed with
I didn't know if I would really like it
or if I really needed it when I bought
it but I'm actually obsessed with the
way it sets my makeup and you guys are
going to see by like the rest of the
stuff that I'm buying like I am obsessed
with this whole kind of like a dewy look
and this really really helps with that
like I love the way this helps with that
you can also put this on your eyeshadow
brush and if you have like kind of like
a shimmery eyeshadow you want to put
this helps keep it in place if you like
what the brush but this first so love
this so far the second thing what
I've been wanting for so long guys is
the gold deposit of mineralized
skinfinish and it is just like a bronzy
Oh like guys guys I'm obsessed like the
way this looks first of all I love
mineralized skinfinish is from a quick
I'm obsessed with them anyway but like
the gold bronze like look at that I put
on my cheeks today I don't know if you
guys can tell but I better right here to
kind of highlight and it's just the
prettiest gold shade and I just love the
way it looks it just makes my skin look
like 20 times better
Wow that was a car thing next at Sephora
I went and I got like three no I got
four things at Sephora first thing I'm
sure you guys is a blush which is kind
of surprising because I really don't
like blushes that much I only have the
core Alyssa by benefit and it's not
really my favorite just because it's so
light on my cheeks it's like I have to
like apply so much just see like if
there's even blush on me so I got this
one which is much darker and this is
outlaw by NARS and I love the way this
looks and also has kind of like a like
shimmering like glow in it again with
the whole glowy thing but I love it and
it goes like perfect like the lip color
that I have every single day which is
this one and I don't know if you guys
can tell they even have it on my cheeks
today but I love love this and I don't
know I just boom it and like it and I
love the packaging of NARS just because
like the math feeling is just really so
chic I hate myself
next I got the roller lash by benefit
and this I am so upset with myself or
even by because everyone on that piece
of hair though whoa where did that
everyone on YouTube talks about this and
I was like it's a mascara like what can
it really like is it really that great
and then Holly came in to Texas which by
the way she's been here for like quite
some time she just went home yesterday
here but um she had this and I used it
and I was like wait this mascara is like
unreal like this is literally the best
mascara I've ever used in my life like
the only mascara I will continue to use
then I bought the Aniston
yeah dip brow pomade or whatever it is
everyone uses this and I really did not
like the pomade the first time I use it
Holly came and she had the dark brow
pomade so I thought it was a little dark
on my eyebrows it was like okay I'll go
like I'll get a lighter shade of the
Paul me so I went in and I got the
medium brown pomade for my eyebrows so
when I got home I put it in my eyebrows
I'm not kidding guys they were like
black like they were like it was unreal
like the my eyebrows her so crazy me and
Holly were dying laughing when I put it
in I only put in one eyebrow and then I
was like no this is not real so I think
that they Miss labeled the like
packaging on the anasazi one because
this is medium brown and it's like 20
shades darker than Hallie's and hers is
dark brown so i think that i
accidentally like got the wrong one or
it just has like the wrong sticker on
the bottom or something I really don't
know but I love the way the pomade works
in my eyebrows like I love the actual
pomade I do need to go in a different
shade than this one but I love love love
the pomade so then I got the naked urban
decay eyeshadow palette the smoky
eyeshadow palette and woah the brush
fell out
the shades in this palette are like
literally to die for I'm obsessed with
them I think that my favorite shade is
13 which is just like a white shade I
know it's weird of course in a smoky
palette I would choose like a white
shade but I love 13
I love combust and like password and
armor which are just like grays and like
just they're just like really armor it's
a shimmery gray password it's like a
dark gray you can put in the crease and
then combust is just like a muted pink
or whatever and I just love this entire
palette I've been wanting it for such a
long time since I saw it on YouTube I
was like I have to have it also
packaging is perfect it's magnetic now
yes and then also the new brushes that
they have in the naked palettes are
awesome and so this one has like a
blending brush on this side and
like a precision one on this side Thank
You orbing today next I went to Ulta so
these are more of drugstore products but
I got this and this is probably my
favorite thing I bought no no no this is
my favorite things that mineralize
skinfinish is but this goes along with
that and this is the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi liquid glow illuminator and this is
perfect I got it in the shade golden and
this basically I put it on my hand and
then I put my foundation on and then I
mix them together and this gives like
the perfect glow to my foundation so
it's not just like one dimensional it
just gives a little bit of shimmer in
with my foundation I am obsessed with
the way that it looks so this I just mix
up my foundation and it just gives a
perfect glow Carli bybel like actually
mentioned this in a video she did it in
her most recent one or gigi hadid makeup
look and I was like I need that it's
perfect so this makes my skin super
glowy and I'm just really liking that
look right now next I bought a NYX lip
pencil and this is in the shade nude
pink of course because like what is my
life my life is literally nude pink but
it is just a really really nice nude
pink it's not really girly explain that
much I just needed a nude pink pencil
because I didn't want my urban decay one
anymore and she want to try something
else so I got the NYX nude pink and I
love the way it applies although it is a
little bit drying on my lips like it's
kind of like chalky it's not as like
creamy as the Urban Decay one but I
really really like the color more than I
like the one I'd ever indicate next I
got the Maybelline master precise liquid
eyeliner and this is just like the
precision eyeliner I needed a new
eyeliner because I had the Maybelline
Line stiletto which I use for like three
years but I use the same one for like
three years and then I don't even know
if they sell anymore because when I went
to go like find it I saw this little
like pin one and said and I was like
this looks so much better and I bought
it and I didn't even look for the
stiletto one so I really really like
this this would be really really good
for winged liner because like the
application it's like a little I don't
know it's just really really precise
which is why it's like master precise
whatever but it would be good for a
winged liner which I don't do but I
really want to try so we'll see
works for this that is everything that I
bought so if you guys like this video
