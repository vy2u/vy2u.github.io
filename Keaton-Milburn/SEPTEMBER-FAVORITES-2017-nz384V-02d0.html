to be my September favorites I know it's
a little bit into October
there is a screeching bus outside I know
it's a little bit into October but I
wanted to include this because I know I
didn't do a September music in the month
which a lot of you guys were tweeting me
about and that's just because we're so
busy with traveling and everything and I
honestly just want to like talk to you
guys and catch up also if you guys are
wanting a tutorial on this makeup look
and this hair look I am uploading one
very very soon and as they fall shit
check it ready with me so be on the
lookout for that because I love the look
and I just really like how it turned out
but without me talking any more let's
get into the favorites so the first
thing I've been using a lot is this like
duo so this is the origins ginseng they
both say ginseng so this is the eye
cream and this is just the moisturizer
so I got these a while ago but I have
been using them every single day for
like two months and I just feel like I
really have seen results and so I want
to share them with you guys what's
really awesome about this is that it's
refreshing and it's actually really
really cold so this is like a little gel
and when I say it's cold it's like a I
don't know how but it stays cold and so
you're supposed to use this in the
morning and it's just was to be like a
little energy boost and kind of wakes
you up which I really like I like using
different moisturizers for the morning
and different ones for the night so I
use these two in the morning and I've
just really been loving them I also
really like the way it smells and it's
so so hydrating especially because I
really really dry skin and I love an
Arizona so if you guys have dry skin
you're looking for like a morning
moisturizer I feel like this is amazing
like absolutely love this next up is
this foundation and I know you guys
probably heard me talk about it so
freakin much but literally every single
person in my life now has this
foundation like I literally gave it to
my roommate I give to like a few girls
that I live with my sorority house I
give it to my mom my sister my aunts I'm
literally recommending it to everyone
because it is the perfect foundation I'm
wearing it today and I wear it every
single day I'm currently in the shade
sand but it is the Too Faced peach
perfect comfort matte foundation and I
have never had a more perfect matte
foundation in my life like this is so
awesome and they have so many different
shades I learn up every single shade and
I just use them for when I'm spray tans
when I'm not spray tan and H
goes on so seamlessly honestly you just
need to get it to try it the other thing
I have from two-faced I really really
love candy Johnson actually came out
with a new collection with two days
which is so freakin good like it's
amazing but my favorite thing from her
collection is the I want candy
two-faced candy Glo Luminizer so this is
just like a glow illuminizer I also wore
it today but it oh my gosh it literally
smells just like cotton candy
it smells so good but I really love
cream highlighters and I love having
like a stick so this looks so so natural
on my skin like it's like a glow but
it's not like a powdery like thick glow
on your face so I just really really
love this if you guys are looking for a
new one next thing I've been loving is
this perfume I got this for my birthday
and this is the Gucci bloom perfume I
know it's expensive but it smells so
good and every single time I wear people
like oh my god you smell good I'm like I
know it's freaking this the bottle is so
cute it's like light pink comes in this
little floral packaging obviously I kept
the packaging because it has flowers on
it so like obviously but I really really
love to smell this if you guys are
looking for a new perfume and you guys
invest in perfumes and you actually like
it might go to that I've literally
always had for like the longest time I
always since like sixth grade have a
warning Viva La Juicy and now it's like
Viva La Juicy and Gucci I wear these two
every single day like I love them so
yeah but next up is this candle so
because it's fall and like fall is my
favorite time to light candles I found
this one and I bought it because it's
yellow but oh my god I wish you could
smell things through the camera because
this smells so freakin good
it's called hey honey and it literally
smells just like honey like it is so
strong and like I'll like this for like
four hours a day and my room will smell
like honey for like three days straight
I think bad them Body Works candles are
amazing and got the body work says the
best job with having candles that are so
strong and the smell like stays in my
room for a long time so I have to light
a candle
every single day sometimes it's like I
could light a candle for like seven
hours and it's like the tiny bit of
smell but this one is like oh my gosh it
smells so good so you guys should
definitely go check out Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works candles the hey honey one is my
favorite I really like sweet scents in
my room like I love the fireside like
marshmallow one things like that but if
you guys are looking for a new one the
hey honey one is really good in a TL oh
so the last thing I have are these
vitamin C these are the perfect women's
multi vitamins these are from Ollie I
guess so
I recently like switched my vitamin just
because I wanted to try different ones
and I also watched born Elizabeth video
about like all the vitamins she takes
and I really just think that I need to
start taking 25 vitamins like her so
yeah I think I'm gonna do that but these
are awesome they're a blend of vitamins
a c d e b's biotin and folic acid so
they're just like everyday vitamins but
I take I take two day and they taste
okay they're not like the best they're
just like little little squishy Guppies
my last favorite is actually an
accessory and it's hidden behind my
necklace or my said behind my shirt
this necklace is from Adina's jewelers
and it is just so pretty and gold and
white and I think gold accessories are
my new favorite thing to do if you guys

leap which you guys should but what are

then I also have these rings that I'm
obsessed with they're from urban and

really care because they're cute and
they look like oh I think that's it
