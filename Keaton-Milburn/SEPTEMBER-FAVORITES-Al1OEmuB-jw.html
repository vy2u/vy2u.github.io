if I'm in focus and my blurry or can you
see me clearly I can see you clearly
whoa I look like a Peter Pan don't I
look like you what's up guys today's
video is going to be a September
favorites and my cousin is here sitting
with me to wave your hand they can see
in the mirror
anyway my cousin Carson is in here and
probably saw her and you were in all the
wood vlogs the Vancouver vlogs and from
the cruise ship you're in like all of
them so she's in all my vlog going to be
doing a September favorites you guys
know what a favorites video is I'm just
gonna be showing you guys my favorite
things from this month so let's get
started so my first favorite I actually
show you guys in my makeup haul a few of
the things and this are from a makeup
haul so don't mind I'm repeating them
but my favorite this month has really
been this foundation brush and this is
by zoeva so it's the 104 buffer brush
whatever so I really really love this
you can also use that you see use a
brush just like this to blend out like
my contour when I use like a cream
whatever but I use this to apply my
foundation everywhere and I really
really like the coverage of it but I
tried to wash it the other day or like
clean it or whatever and it just didn't
clean very well and I don't know if it's
whatever I use but that was gross but
overall this brush applies my makeup
really really well so I like this a lot
next I have this lip color by buxom and
I actually tweeted this a long time ago
but then I lost it so it is just like a
really pretty like pink nude which I own
like 100 pink nudes but this was just
really really pretty and it's super
creamy and I saw it in claudia Salukis
video there's children screaming so
don't mind the screaming children all my
cousins are here right now but anyway I
got this because I love like pink nudes
and this is so creamy and I saw this in
Claudia Salukis video and I was like I
need to try that I've never tried it so
I really really love this with like a
liner and then I just fill this all in
it is just a it's called a nude lip
foundation
which is what I really really liked and
this is in the shade undressed next I
have this nail polish and this is the
what is this all eyes on nudes lip
polish lip polish I just said lip
Holmwood sorry I'm getting so confused
okay wait so this is this is the I was I
always said FC cricket this is the Essie
nail polish and it is in the shade color
whenever all eyes on nude and it says
cashmere matte I didn't notice this when
I bought the nail polish and then I put
it on my nails and I was like wait this
is matte it is just the prettiest like
it's just a tan nail polish basically
but it's really really pretty because
it's nude and I use this when I don't
have fake nails on because when I take
my fingers off my nails are super
damaged so I always like to go over it
which is like a neutral kind of like
nail polish and so this works really
well for that
next I bought the Mac prep and prime fix
plus and I really really love this the
first time I used it I did not
understand how to use it on my face it
was like this is gross and then I tried
to put it on my brush and do my
eyeshadow and it just like wasn't
working but once you like tested out of
it it works better and I really really
love this for applying like glittery
eyeshadows I don't know I just really
really like the way this looks with
glitter eyeshadows not so much on my
face like after I set my makeup I only
do that if I really want to look super
dewy but I like this for my eyeshadow
next I have a perfume and this is the
Juicy Couture perfume I forgot like the
actual name of it what is the name of
this I forgot like the actual name of
this but they sent this to me and I post
a picture with it on my Instagram and it
smells so good it smells really good the
only thing is that it smells almost like
my grandma but in like a better way like
it smells like an older person could
wear those perfume as opposed to like
the Viva La Juicy the Viva La Juicy one
which is like my favorite smells very
like vanilla E and almost like younger
or whatever but this smells so good and
it's definitely for like a more mature
like
or like night going out so I really
really like this for that and the
packaging is so pretty gold I love it
next I have a watch which is super
random cuz I don't think I've ever
talked about watches on here but this
one is from Daniel Wellington and I'm
not like a super big watch person like I
don't like I'm not like obsessed with
them or I think they're like super cute
I really like very basic watches and
this one is just like a black leather
watch and the like face of it is rose
gold and it's super super basic which is
my favorite thing because I can wear
this with like basically anything that I
want like I could wear with this outfit
I can just wear it anywhere I want and
so I love this watch if you guys want to
go check out Daniel Wallington I'm gonna
leave them down below so use the link
that I put down below so that you guys
can go buy one okay so the next thing
are shoes and I got Birkenstocks so I
got these like for my birthday and I
don't know like you know there's like
twenty hundred like different pair of
socks they all kind of look the same I
don't know which kind these are but when
I find them I'll link them down below so
I can go check them out but I love the
color of these and I've really been
liking them because I used to have a
little like Jesus sandals that are like
tan but I lost them so I really needed
like a new pair and these just look way
cuter because they go with a lot more
than the Jesus sandals too and
Birkenstocks are just like a thing right
now so I love these next thing is this
candle and this is so weird for it to be
my favorite because I think it was one
of my favorites last year from Christmas
so this is actually a Christmas candle
and it's frosted cranberry so this is
normally what I would burn in like the
Christmas time but I I don't know why I
just smelt it and I was like oh I
thought this was good say it actually
like fits into the fall category as well
as Christmas and I just really loved the
smell of this it's just like frosted
cranberries like it literally smells
like frozen cranberries are like fruity
ness but would like a hint of fall and
Christmas I don't know it's just a
mixture of yummy this and so I've been
using the skin a lot it's like
empty or whatever but I love this I
bought two new candles from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and they are my favorite candles
like ever and I haven't even looked them
yet which is why I didn't mention them
in Stanford's video because I was like
you can't really mention a candle that
you haven't lit yet but I love them so
they'll probably be in another video but
this one I've been burning a lot more I
don't know why I just really like this
one so now moving on to music I'm gonna
go on my phone and pick out so I
recently just like started paying for
Spotify like I did like the 7 day free
trial and I really liked it so if you
guys don't have Spotify like get Spotify
it's so good and I can make playlist
like anytime I want
this isn't sponsored by the way I just
really like Spotify and I just want it
so I'm super excited about it um but I
made a playlist and it's my September
favorites or whatever and I don't have a
lot because I'm like just getting into
like making the playlist and stuff but I
made one and my favorite song off my
playlist is I'm yours
by Justine Justine Skye or whatever it's
one of Kylie Jenner's friends you guys
probably know if you like well Kylie
Jenner she has this new album it's
emotionally unavailable and this song
I'm yours is so good I'm obsessed with
it and I also have collide by her which
is featuring Tyga and then I mentioned
in my other my last August favorites
video I mentioned at least a acara which
I have her whole like album or her EP or
whatever in here cuz I love that and
then I also have really been liking
Halsey so I have the new Americana which
if you guys in policies pants and you
guys like you're so basic but I don't
really listen to Holsey that much I only
like 2 or 3 songs by her but this one I
belong sending to a lot this month and
then the last album that I've really
been loving this month is what a time to
be alive by drinkin future I love this
album and you guys want to know my
favorites song my favorite song is
probably diamonds dancing or I'm the
plug no I like change locations a lot
too I don't know I really like all of
them so this one's really good if you
like that kind of music but yeah that's
it for my music so for my last favorite
