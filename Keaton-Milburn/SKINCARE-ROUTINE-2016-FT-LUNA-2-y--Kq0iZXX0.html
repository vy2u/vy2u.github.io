okay close the door that's not even a
word what's up guys so today's video is
going to be my skincare routine and this
is probably the most requested video
I've literally ever done other than my
morning routine but that was like a year
ago but like normally it's just like all
over the place in the comments you guys
always ask me for different stuff but
this has been so requested so I'm going
to be doing that now sorry it took so
long for me to be doing this before we
get right into the video and I show you
guys everything that I do the first
thing I want to say and that this is my
routine normally when I'm going to bed I
guess it depends on what I'm doing it
but for the most part this is me taking
my makeup off what I put on after that
kind of thing or sometimes if I like go
to sleep with my makeup and then I wake
up in the morning I'll do it in the
morning like that but this is for the
most part what I do at night even though
it's like a daytime when I still make
whatever I just want to show you guys
this really quickly I'm obsessed with it
it's super easy to travel with it's also
silicone so like unlike the Clarisonic
or like other brushes this doesn't like
hold the makeup in here so you have to
like replace brushes that's not
expensive like you just buy this and
like that's it also it's like all
waterproof and you have like a little
charger instead so I really really like
that that it's not like battery powered
I like that you can just like plug it
into your wall charge it like a phone or
whatever so I love this I'm obviously
going to talk a little bit more about it
later but I just want to show you guys
this first because I love it and I'm
excited for the video so let's get it to
it so the first thing I do is get my
face wet and this is just going to help
take all my makeup off and of course my
eye makeup is beautiful once I do that
I'm just using the both chef's makeup
breakup cleansing oil and this really
has been helping me take all my makeup
off I'm used for like a whole year now
and so I just rub this in lightly
because I'm going to be going in with
Luna 2x4 EO so to turn it on I press the
minus and plus button I hold it down and
then I press the center button to turn
it on and then that'll make it like
vibrating stuff so then I'm going to
rinse it underneath the water and I like
to do this because it helps I don't know
I just feel like it gives like something
else so I do that I started my channel
work my way up and so I just make
circular motions and this seriously has
helped my skin so much it takes off all
my makeup it's crazy how much makeup was
seriously probably on my face before I
did this so I just love this and like
look you can just see it's so gross you
can just see all the makeup coming off
but I love the way this looks because it
sense it is not a brush it's really easy
to just like clean it off dry it and
then leave it on the counter so once I
do that I'm going to be just taking a
towel drying my face and then I'm going
to go in with my granny err blackhead
I'm eliminating scrub and this is just
going to be like an exfoliant so I just
rub it with my fingers and then I wipe
it right off I just like the feeling I
get after this just like my face feels
really really fresh afterwards also my
face is really pale my neck is really
tan because I get spray tan so yeah then
I'm using my Huggies wipes you guys know
I always use these I know it's super
weird but they really helped with my eye
makeup so I'm just taking unscented
Huggies wipes and I'm wiping around my
eye and then after I do that I'm gonna
wipe a little bit around my face the
next thing I'm going to be doing is
taking the guard EA this is the
cleansing I don't even know what it's
called I forgot but it's just like the
cleansing water and I put this on a
cotton pad and I just like press it in
then I'm going to be taking the makeup
that's probably left on my neck which is
also mixed with like some grace spray
tan
and then wiping them on my face I really
hate the feeling of having extra makeup
on so I make sure I get it all off and
then I'm taking the lush skin drink
moisturizer and this guy's is super
super moisturizing so I just dab on a
little bit I do not put on it at all
because like I don't know it just
stresses me out of my face feels extra
oily but I'm just rubbing this all in
and then after I do that the last thing
I'm going to be doing is taking me Mario
Badescu I think that's what it's called
um this is the facial spray with rose
water I'm going to spray a few pumps of
this on my face and this just finishes
my whole skincare routine makes me feel
I don't know it just makes me feel fresh
and I love the feeling it gives so yeah
that is it for my skincare routine also
