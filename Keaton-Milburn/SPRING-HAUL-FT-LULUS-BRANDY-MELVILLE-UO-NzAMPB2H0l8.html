want to be in focus for this video
I literally already film this video and
I was out of focus and then the last
video I uploaded was out of focus as
well so hopefully this really turns out
good what do I have guys another haul
whoa okay anyway shut up cute so I have
a bunch of stuff that I'm just gonna
show you guys because you already know
that this is a haul and again I don't
have any makeup on but today's reason is
because I'm actually filming a makeup
tutorial later today but I wanted to
film this first and not after it makeup
store I don't know I'm picky so whatever
just deal with it I'm just gonna be
showing you guys the clothes it's not a
try on haul I'm just gonna show you guys
what I got so um let's get into just so
much Britney mobile so when I was in LA
I bought some stuff so the first thing
is this jacket and this is just a tan
zip up hoodie jacket and I just saw it
and I'm always looking for just jackets
to wear with like jean shorts I don't
know I think this was good for like the
beach if you're like on the beach coz
it's one deer by the beach you guys yeah
anyway it's one deer by the beach so
with shorts and stuff it's cold just
grab this and it's tan it goes like the
sand and stuff moving on okay so the
next thing I got from brandy melville
some of this stuff I ordered online and
it came in the mail and then some of it
I bought when I was in LA so this I
bought when I was at only as well so
this is just a strug t-shirt and I
thought it would be cute with jean
shorts because I'm always just wanted to
throw on t-shirts and I don't want to
dress the fall time so and this is so
soft it's so soft but it's like red blue
and orange and it's a cream colored
t-shirt and then the next thing I bought
when I was in LA are these socks and me
and Hallie bought matching socks so
they're just like red Navy and white
socks and we also bought the same hoodie
if you guys saw on my Instagram I have
loaded picture
like matching that's a plug for my
Instagram so go follow me on Instagram
because I'm always posting stuff ok so
this is I ordered this like from brain
level online and the stuff came in the
mail so the first one is this turtleneck
and it's just I can't tell if it's black
and white or it's navy white I think
it's Navy but I honestly can't tell the
coloring is so weird so it's just a
striped turtleneck long sleep and you
guys like Keaton it's about to be spring
but I don't know I think it's just a
look and I also have this I bought it in
tan and it's short sleeve I'm uploading
a video very soon that has like outfits
and stuff so you guys will see that cuz
I accidentally gave it to my friend and
she's wearing it right now oh the next
thing I got from brandy melville I'm
just I'm gonna have to return it because
it's so atrocious on me it is oh it's
still wrinkly
oh it's so wrinkly it's just this blue
silk dress and I thought that it would
look just like not for like going out
maybe I don't really know I just thought
it was pretty and I like silk stuff so I
was like you know what let me just like
try it out so this was a little too
small to like look normal on me so I'm
gonna have to return that umm okay then
I have this jean jacket and it's just
the jean jacket you see on their
Instagram if you follow this says girls
on the back I already have a jean jacket
from Brandi but this one says girls up
in the back and I don't know I just
thought it was so cute they were
uploading so many pictures and I was
like I feel like I need it I feel like
it's like a it's a squad I'm not a part
of so I bought it
this I mentioned in a favorite to be on
this also came in the mail and it's just
another sweatshirt
but this one is cropped so I love
cropped sweatshirts and there's such a
thing right now like you know like I
know like makeup by Mandy or Amanda so
she always uploads like sweatpants it's
like a cropped sweatshirt and like the
matching sweats and I think that's
really cute and I just like cropped like
anything so this crop sweatshirt is I'm
living in it I'm literally living in
moving on I got some things from Lola's
again because I so the first thing is
this dress and all of these items are
like super summery and springy because I
don't know like I don't have a lot of
colorful things and I feel like I want
to dress nicer in the spring like I
always just thrown like a t-shirt in
Nikes because it's hot and like what the
heck who's trying to look cute so I
bought this dress because like I don't
know it's just something you can throw
on and it's just really cute so it's
like a mauve pink thing and it's six
caliphs at the bottom and it's open back
and it just ties I don't know I thought
it was really pretty and it comes in
like a really pretty blue but I feel
like this will make my skin to look
better also haven't gotten a spray tan
I'm probably like a month so I'm really
really pale which is also another reason
I'm not wearing makeup because I don't
have makeup to match like this paleness
next is a romper so this is like a
tie-dye ish peach romper and it just has
a little tie right here cute in the back
I don't know it goes higher up I thought
it was really cute again colors like
this are really gonna make my skin tone
when I'm tan look a lot better so I like
this and robbers are really really easy
for the spring and summer and all that
kind of stuff so um let's talk about
another rompers so this one of those
with the bottoms you this one is more
it's a lot brighter and I normally don't
have things like this but again neon
like if you guys have ever worn like a
neon pink or like a neon blue like that
makes your skin look so good for some
reason so this I thought was really
pretty it's just the perfect amount of
color long sleeve and the shorts on the
side go like higher up like see there's
like a little button
and it ties around the waist I don't
know I just thought this was really
pretty and cute so I like that and then
this I'm really a really obsessed with
but I obsessed with obsessed with but I
don't know if it's to like scandal
I don't know I just thought it was cute
so these are actually shorts and they go
like higher up they're just like blue
little shorts and I don't know I don't
know I like the color of them and then
the top is what makes me like so this is
the top of it so I don't think this is
for like going to the mall shopping in
this outfit but I do think like if
you're just gonna like go out like on
the beach or something like that it's
like a breezy cute little outfit with
like some sandals or you can wear it
with heels if you're like into like
dressing this up and stuff but I just
thought this was really pretty color and
I don't have like any like sets so I
thought this was a cute two-piece set
next I bought this top again with like
the tops that I need for the summer it's
just like a I don't know it's just like
a it looks weird on camera but and it's
still Brinkley because it was like in a
box like yeah so this is it it just has
little detailing on the front this is
the back and I thought this would just
be cute with like jean shorts and like
chillin like just to go out and you know
you just need shirts like that to go out
in and then because literally guys I
have wanted white shorts for so long and
it's not like I can't find them it's
just like I never find ones that are
like a good enough price or like I don't
know so I found these on Lulu's and
they're just basic high-waisted white
shorts and I don't have white jeans I
don't have a white skirt I don't have
white shorts so I just thought I really
needed these to go for like this summer
so I could just pair any top with them
and they fit really really good and I
don't know I really like them so got
these shorts and then the last two
things I got from Lulu's because
obviously if you're on a website that
also has Beauty like a beauty section
like Urban Outfitters their beauty
section gets me every time I'm like I've
never seen that I need that in the
beauty section of Lulu's I got two
things and this is the brow highlighting
pencil by Sigma because they don't it
sound like Lulu's brand makeup it's like
other brands of makeup which is good so
this is the Sigma a brow highlighting
thing and this one is like a shimmery
pencil and this one is a pink pencil and
they
have one of these by benefits that I had
and they have it in pink and then they
have it like the shimmery one and I
remember I bought the shimmery one and I
was like oh I wish I woulda bought it in
pink but now look this is both so that's
exciting and then because I've always
wanted this and every beauty guru like
has this brush it talks about it it's
the Sigma e25 blending brush and I was
like heating just buy it because I hear
everyone saying like I love using the
Sigma e25 so I bought it
okay so that's all that from Lulu's if
you guys want to go check out Lewis I
will link all this stuff I will list
everything from this video down below
and go check out Lewis because they have
amazing spring clothing items right now
that I am absolutely obsessed with and
they also have a lot of really good
beauty products on there so yeah go
check out Lulu's
and while we're on the top of the beauty
let's talk about makeup so I got this
stuff from a cosmetics and I I mean I've
yet to try all of it out but the things
I have tried I want to tell you guys so
the first thing I've tried I got the
bye-bye under-eye concealer and I am in
the shade light because look at me so
this has really helped me as I told you
guys I had like a rash underneath my eye
and so this bye-bye under-eye concealer
literally made it vanish underneath my
eyes so I am really happy with this it's
just a concealer but for some reason I
always see everyone talking about it and
it really is great so then I also have
the superhero mascara this is the
volumizing mascara and I'm just gonna
take it out and show you guys the brush
you guys can understand first of all you
really really like the packaging because
it's like this weird like curved shape
anyway I don't know it's easy to hold
but the brush like I'm obsessed with
like skinny really bristled like
bristled is that even a word
I don't know I'm obsessed with brushes
like this it reminds we have the benefit
they're real brush and I really
like that one so I think I'm gonna love
this and then they also sent me the your
skin but better CC cream and I'm very
very excited about this because I feel
like this is what I'm gonna be wearing
most of this summer because it has SPF
50 in it and it's a lighter shade I have
a light shade so I have fair and then I
also have medium and these shades are
gonna be really good to like mix
together and get the perfect skin tone
while it's summer because I'm going to
going back and forth between light and
dark okay anyway I had to fix my camera
but back to beauty so that is everything
I got from it cosmetics that I really
really am liking right now and if I try
out like more of this stuff which I am
gonna turn it out but if I like it a lot
then I'll let you guys know it'll
probably be in a favorites video but
moving on also while I was in LA I
stopped at Mac so I bought two lip
pencils oh yeah there's the other one
so this one is the pro long wear lip
pencil and this is in the shade cultured
and this is a really pretty brown it
also has shimmer to it which I kind of
like because I have very drying matte
lipsticks like lip liners and lipsticks
and stuff so I like that this is shimmer
and it feels really really smooth and
then I bought the just regular lip
pencil in dervish and a lot of people
have this and it's a really pretty
brownish like mauve pink which again I
guy have like seven shades of that but I
just felt like I needed this one to go
with the lipstick that I bought so I
bought the matte lipstick in honey love
you guys have probably seen this before
but it's just a really pretty nude I
don't know it's more nudish Brown than
like any other lip stick that I have
from there okay so the last things that
I have so the last things I have are
from Urban Outfitters and the first
thing is this shirt and this is just a
slouchy v-neck it has navy lining on the
collar and on the sleeves and I just
thought it was gonna be perfect with
jean shorts because again that's just
the look I'm going for right now just a
shirt shorts like chillin that's it
and then
I bought this shirt again to go with the
whole shirt and shorts thing I want to
seek just bought it for the color so
it's a really pretty green and I think
it's gonna make my eyes look good but it
just says let the shenanigans begin and
I thought that was really I don't know I
thought it was cute and the color looks
good so stop making fun of me and then
this top is really when I saw it in
Urban Outfitters I was like this is so
unique and like different and I just
wanted to wear it and be like guys look
how cool I am like this is such a
different shirt it's a crop top it's
literally just a tan crop top um yeah
and so I just bought it because it was
there and I needed a crop top just to go
with some shorts okay so the first pair
of shoes I'm gonna show you guys so you
guys know I haven't eat an air max pea
Nikes so I bought them in red because
look at them up look at them so if I
have these in gray and I have them in
tan but then when I saw these in red
I've literally been looking everywhere
for red shoes like not just these just
like any red Nikes so when I saw this I
was like I already have them I know I
like how they fit I like how they look
so I bought them the next ones that I'm
obsessed with you guys maybe saw in my
blog but I bought these wallahs in LA
and they're the adidas ultra boost in
white and I think they like make a
certain amount of them and then they
like send them out and then once they're
all sold out like you can't really buy
them again so luckily I found them in my
size when I was in LA because Haley has
everything yeah so yeah there are men's
as well so I'm an 8 and a half and
women's shoes and and men's I'm a 7 for
these if you guys are wondering if you
guys want to buy them and you have the
same shoe size probably not but yeah
anyway um so yeah that is it for my haul
I hope you guys liked it I know I do a
lot of pause but honestly I just buy a
lot of clothes and then when I upload
them on its room you guys like oh my god
like where'd you get that where'd you
get this and it's like why don't I just
show you guys where I got everything so
yeah that's it for this video and if you
guys want to go check out Lulu's I will
leave everything down below I seriously
love

a lot of new spring things anyway
