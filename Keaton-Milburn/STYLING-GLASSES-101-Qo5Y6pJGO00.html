nobody but the city moves to obey the
way comes to it baby
you need it
the way comes to live what's up guys so
today's video is going to be a styling
glasses 101 video and I'm so excited to
be working with glasses usa.com for this
video I am obsessed with their glasses
and you guys know I'm literally so blind
so being able to get different glasses
and like style them just like an
accessory is so so fun to me their
website has so many different selections
they have so many different brands it's
like adidas brave and they have just so
many different sizes that you can pick
from which is really really awesome when
looking for glasses because I know it's
really really hard online buying glasses
you don't know how they're gonna look
they also have like a virtual Tryon on
their website so you can like see what
it looks like on someone else also if
you guys want to see what it looks like
on someone else that's why I'm making
this video because it's so hard to tell
how glasses actually look on someone so
I really want to show you guys different
hairstyles you can wear with different
glasses to print lip looks and makeup
and things like that then you can do
with glasses because I feel like just
because you're blind you have to wear
glasses you shouldn't be able to that
have fun with them and style them in
different ways and I just think they're
so fun style so without me talking any
more let's get into the video so
starting off I'm going to show you guys
the makeup I would normally wear when
I'm wearing glasses I'm using a very
light brown transition shade for my
crease and then I'm going up a little
bit of a darker color I keep it very
very simple on the eyes but my favorite
thing to do is probably add a darker
Brown which is what I'm showing you here
and I'm adding a darker Brown and
decrease in all over the lid just to
give my eyes some depth because if I
were like basically no eye shadow my
eyes look just very I don't know they
just look small and your glasses already
hide your eyes anyway so I like to make
them appear like I don't know there's
just something else there so then I am
highlighting obviously under my eyebrow
and then I add a lot of highlighter in
my like tear duct just to make my eyes
look a little bit bigger again your
glasses always are hiding your eyes so I
try to make them appear as prominent as
possible so I added black eyeliner which
I didn't show just liquid liner and then
I'm adding a ton of mascara to have long
full lashes and this is something people
either like hate or love but I am adding
fake freckles so I do actually have
freckles guys not just adding them on
like I literally never had me I do have
freckles there are just covered up by my
makeup so I'm adding those on and then
I'm putting my foundation brush over
them to make them look more I don't know
like blended and not so fake but I do
like to add these because I think
they're so cute with glasses so now I'm
adding some lip liner I'm using this lip
color for the first glasses and I am
straightening my hair because all of
these looks you can do is straight hair
you can do them with curly hair too just
for me personally I wanted to wear all
these glasses with straight hair so
these are the first glasses these are in
the style Florence and I am in love with
them guys these have definitely got to
be my favorite glasses to style and you
can just wear them with every single
outfit I am obsessed with them and I got
them in gold so for the next look I'm
just starting halfway at my head and I'm
going to just take my fingers back and
pull up probably the top half of my hair
but I'm leaving the two front pieces
down and I'm just tightening it and
pulling it into a ponytail super messy
super simple and then the glasses that
I'm pairing from glasses usa.com are
these I believe are Ray Ban 70 49 is the
style I'm gonna link everything down
below but I love these super simple
nothing dramatic but I absolutely love
these all the glasses also start at $48
and come with free prescription lens so
that's awesome so for this next look I'm
just pulling my hair bag into it various
like ponytail keep in mind that although
I do have purple hair not everyone has
purple hair and I do get colored glasses
which I'm going to be showing you here
but I think that's a glasses I pick full
look really really good but someone else
like dark brown hair just because
they're yellow doesn't mean you can't
wear them I added a nude lip as well
just because I want to keep it simple
I'm already wearing yellow and purple
but their website is amazing they have
over 2,500 different styles and so many
brands like adidas Raven and everything
so I just absolutely love the way these
look so for this next look I am putting
my hair into a very messy bun you guys
commented on my Instagram picture
because I posted a picture with my hair
like this new guys were like please show
us but I'm seriously it's so easy and I
don't even know how I do it I'm just
wrapping my hair around it twice I'm
wrapping the rubber band around my hair
twice and that's basically it and then
to make it look a little bit more cute
and messy I'm taking some of the front
pieces out on the side and then from
like the very top but these glasses
seriously complete the look like look
how freakin cute these aren't like the
barber glasses I think is the style of
them again everything is linked down
below but I love these and I don't know
they just looks so cute with the messy
bun glasses and messy buns are like the
perfect pairing so for this look I'm
just pulling my hair into a low bun in
the back of my head kind of like the
last one but just a little bit easier
and then I'm pulling the front pieces
out like I didn't last one to make it
look a little bit Messier and I am
adding a red eye lift to this look I
know I have purple hair I understand
colors clash but I still like it and I
thought that a red lip looks the cutest
with these glasses which oh my gosh guys
look how cute they are they're clear
which I think these are perfect for any
hair color no matter I doesn't matter
what your hair color is obviously purple
just because they're clear I think they
go with everything and I think these are
so cute so thanks for watching this is
