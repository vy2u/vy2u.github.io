one wants to kill him anyway so I just
like to get my coffee first because that
is like how I start my dad normally
don't eat breakfast I'm debating on if I
want breakfast I was going to eat a
banana but I don't like when they're
like this I like when they're like green
like they have to be super right so yeah
probably not me breakfast I am just
going to get my coffee and go back up to
I just love blog style morning routines
because I just feel like I'm literally
waking up with you guys like I'm just
waking up going about my day going about
my usual
life I look like I have those email like
things that I used to have like when I
was in seventh grade Oh cute so lately
my favorite spot and my house right now
has been this corner of my living room
here's my notebook any video ideas I'm
having for the leak or anything that I'm
just like oh I might want to do this or
like if I just come up with an idea I
like to write it down so I like to sit
here and I will just write in this
notebook all of my video ideas but
because I cannot sit in silence i watch
Netflix so I don't know what necklace
show you guys are watching comment in
the comments down below because I need a
new Netflix series to watch I just
finished shameless and I'm currently
watching orange is the new black I
restarted watching new girl because I'm
like all out of series so currently I'm
watching orange is a new black is like
so good honestly the season as I kind of
like I don't know how I feel about it
but I'm on episode 4 so I'm going to
really quickly just like write in my
journal and watch an episode of Warren
Jeffs news like I say really quickly
there's like an hour-long episode but
that's like literally what I do with my
morning so yeah so mind you
so I've been is writing down all the
ideas that I have and things that I want
to film this week I didn't finish the
episode of orange is the new black but I
will finish it like later champ for a
glass sleep now I need to get ready cuz
this hair actually probably I can do it
because my hair is really just going to
stay looking ratchet but now I feel I
put my contacts said to my makeup that
kind of thing just get anybody it for
the day I think reading some music you
guys you guys want to know what music
I'm going to make to you go to my music
of the month's video it's on my channel
right here to watch it okay oh my gosh
so I'm guys know I always always always
do cleaning products like it's not a new
thing that this is not like a big
sponsored video like this is genuinely I
always use their product if you guys
know me so every time I wake up my skin
I have very very dry skin and depends on
what skin type you guys have but
honestly I don't think it really matters
because it's woods there's bomb I'm
using at the Clinique Moisture Surge
extended thirds relief actually already
had this and I used a whole thing of it
so basically it is a moisturizer I'm
gonna put this all over literally
dotting it all over my face and is
honestly so refreshing it's cool look on
my face it feels like it's calming it's
refreshing it also moisturizes for up to
24 hours so that's really really awesome
because I have really dry skin and so
whenever I'm putting a moisturizer on in
the morning I'm always worried that when
I put like makeup on right goes out
today
and it's going to be flaky but this
helps me not have flaky skin the tubs
moisturize it and keep it hydrated like
throughout the whole day so that's
really awesome that's like one of the
five thousand reasons why I absolutely
love this moisturizer it's also pretty
affordable for moisturizer I know is
going to work with my skin I know it was
hydrating me and like get rid of all the
dryness this is $39 which i think is
honestly awesome because there's a lot
of product in here and I oh you saw me I
only use like a few little dogs
everywhere and then success it they
actually love this moisturizer this is
the is first step before I put any
makeup on I always always use a
moisturizer and especially this one
that's going to hydrate and keep my face
hydrated all days I don't want to worry
about it so thank you for cleaning again
for sponsoring this video and I will
leave a link in the description if you
guys want to go get this moisture as it
were to go to your local meat counter
and get it it is amazing lick it
seriously awesome camera was in such a
weird spot like I feel like you couldn't
really see me so I moved it but now I'm
going to just do a really really simple
and quick makeup those business like if
I know are not going anywhere bougie I
think I'm going to go eat with my mom
later I might go to lunch so I'm just
going to really quick make up for that
first thing is priming time using a
toothpaste hangover primer just because
this is just a go-to primer also
normally I will try and use a
moisturizing primer before I put my
makeup on but since I used a moisturizer
I don't need that I just need a primer
next I'm using this Maybelline Dream
pure BB cream and this is just like
light light coverage because I don't
really need anything like special today
just a little little something
I'm not going in with urban decay
concealer I'm going to set my face now
with the Maybelline better skin powder I
just like I don't know I like the way
this looks I'm also going to use a
two-faced blush this is the peach one
peach induced blush on for brows
normally I would like to fill them in
and I would like to be real extra but
I'm not going to do that so I'm using
the Maybelline brow and size and I'm
going to under my brow and also all over
my lid now I'm just going to apply some
mascara because why not to top it off
I'm just going to add some lip liner you
know me I'm using SPICE by Mac young
guess what I am not even going to touch
my ear just going to stay a big ol
brittleness what am I supposed to do
with this so this is why I went for this
top is from Zara and I just like that
it's like high neck I also worth to
Disney World because it's very Disney
and this I know it looks so short but
it's actually short so it looks like a
skirt from the front but it's like
shorts in the back so it's really really
comfortable so this is the end of my
routine this is what I do I wake up get
coffee video ideas do a little a little
makeup if you will big thank you again
to a Clinique for sponsoring this video
I absolutely love working with Clinique
