guys so today's video is going to be a
summer outfits of the week so you guys
have been requesting this a lot because
I haven't done a lot of clothing videos
recently and that it's just because I've
been slacking and I ordered so many
clothes and they took like literally six
weeks to get here so it took so long for
me to be able to film a clothing haul
and just any kind of lookbook type of
deal so that is why it took me so long
and I'm not naked I am wearing it dog
thank you anyway this video is a little
bit more casual kind of summer outfits
of the week I just wanted to show you
guys how I styled a lot of the pieces I
recently showed in my try on haul
because a lot of you guys like to peek
so you're like how do you wear it with
this and things like that just clothes
and trendy kind of things that I've been
liking at the moment I want to show you
guys how to style and what I've been
wearing a lot of these some ourselves
you guys do like the field please give a
big thumbs up and let me know what other
videos you guys want to see in the
comments down below and I'm going to
stop talking now and let's get into the
video so the first outfit is this
bodysuit is from Urban Outfitters I am
wearing a band oMG thick because it's
very see-through and then the pants are
from brandy melville I've been
instagramming these so much lately and
you guys are asking me like where
they're from and I cut them for a while
but I just started styling them
differently so I love these and then I
paired it with two necklaces the top one
it's from the M jewelers online and then
the second one is from around then for
shoes I just like to keep it comfy so
I'm wearing my adidas superstar so this
is actually a jumpsuit I would call it
from the awesome under line which is
like B pajamas section at Urban
Outfitters but I just like to wear out
as like a normal jump suit just because
I really like how it has little V in the
front it's so so comfy so I've scared it
with the necklaces that I wore in the
previous out that you just saw and then
I also try to
with the sandals so these are also from
Urban Outfitters and they're just really
comfy and I think they make it look
really casual I don't know why
everything in this video is literally
from Urban Outfitters I guess I just
like don't know any other stores
though so this has got to be my favorite
outfit out of all of these but the top
is from Urban Outfitters tube tops are
perfect for the summer has been wearing
them like every day and then these
shorts guys are everything they're
totally calm and I've never found better
shorts it's so random but I am in love
with them and I don't know just look at
this they're just so cute so two dresses
outfit up a little bit more I paired it
with some necklaces so the top one is
from forever 21 to choker
those are like huge star as from bonds
are imaged in the favorites I'll link
all these down below and then I have
another one which is from urban as well
for shoes I just stuck to converse and
then I paired it with these socks thanks
to Holly she gave me these I love
wearing colorful socks at like some what
kind of match my outfit but like not
really I just think they're cute to wear
with like adidas or converse so that is
what I paired with you
so this look I've also so in love with
so the topic from forever 21 and I got
an oversight so that I could have it off
the shoulder and I tied it up and I just
think it looks oh so pretty I noticed
it's not a trend right now and then the
jeans are from Topshop they are my new
obsession I've never found jeans that
fit me so well and I love love love to
colors so I also paired it with the same
necklaces that is like goals and pretty
so again top chokers from birth 21 and
then font star and Urban Outfitters are
the other two and necklaces I just
absolutely love this book I also just
paired it with these simple booties
they're just Steve Madden I got some
glute luscom but they're just really
simple and I feel like complete the look
really well
so this look looks super like Music
Festival Coachella ish but it's also
super summery so the top and skirt are
from Urban Outfitters these skirt I am
obsessed with I like that it goes higher
up on the sides I don't know if that's
like asymmetrical I'm not sure the
wording but I just really really liked
the look of this because I bought them
at completely different times and then
they ended up looking really really well
together and then again I paired it with
these three necklaces this has just been
a combo necklaces I've been wearing
literally every single day so I paired
it with these and then I also have these
Steve Maddox blue heels which I just
thought looked really really cool
because I didn't want to wear nude heels
I just didn't think that that gave it a
like good 5 so I thought that the blue
will do really really cool little skirt
so that is it for this week's video I
hope you guys liked it if you guys want
to see more after the week videos like
this give this video a big thumbs up and

guys want to see the full posts of these
