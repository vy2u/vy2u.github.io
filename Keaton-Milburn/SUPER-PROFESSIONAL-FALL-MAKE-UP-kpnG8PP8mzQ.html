going to be a makeup tutorial obviously
and this is a full makeup tutorial it's
kind of late into fall whatever I really
really wanted to film it and I haven't
filmed the makeup tutorial since my back
to school makeup tutorial and this is
gonna be like a very casual makeup
tutorial I'm just gonna be talking you
guys through it I'm really really not
the best eye makeup but this is the way
I like to do my makeup and a lot of you
guys have been asking about it so that's
why I did it but you have you guys
really like it and let's get into it
okay
so the first thing I do is pull my hair
back so just put it in oh by the way I
got my blood taken today
um Maile I'm just gonna be talking you
guys about this about random crap hope
you don't mind it's not all gonna be
about makeup and stuff but I got my
blood taken today and can do I have this
well I didn't get it taken I belonged
here too like if my blood or whatever
and they took a pint of blood from my
arm and this freaking hurts but it's
okay because for a better cause what are
you growling at so normally I will
moisturize my face but the moisturizer
that I use has to like soak into my skin
because it's like hella oily it's not
make sense so I'm not gonna put that on
right now but I'm going to take the
Porefessional by benefit and I'm gonna
put this let see where I wanted to put
it oh okay I got the little sample ones
I didn't want to like buy the whole
thing you know cuz it's expensive I
don't want to see if I liked it and
honestly I really don't think it does
that much for me so I only apply like
right here because it helps like cover
the main front part of my face or
something like that I don't know I don't
know next because my skin decided to
freak out in the past couple of weeks
and it doesn't look like it on camera
but I got like a bunch of pimples here
and this one came today like for no
reason but I'm not the new NYX gotcha
Covered covering covering total I don't
know it's a concealer
it's probably the best I've ever used
it's literally like this could cover
like expurgate tattoo like this stuff is
amazing I literally use keep saying
literally I used to think the tiniest a
little dab of it there's a mirror behind
this camera but I just put it on my chin
okay so it looks hella orange but that's
because my foundation is gonna be orange
layer so I'm gonna blend it in I'm gonna
take this little beauty but this is not
a medium under this is a foundation
brush this one dates your brush from
zoeva just that I just you know pour the
whole thing whatever I feel like
honestly but recently I have been using
the Born This Way to face foundation
it's like a run new favorite because
it's a medium to full coverage just
don't like if I want to cake my face I
can do it with this and if I don't want
to I still do it with this and it
doesn't look that bad but you guys can't
really towel kind of but my face has
much paler than my neck because I get
spray tans so what I do is I take this
foundation put a little pump on my hand
that's a little bit and then I take the
Make Up For Ever professional Paris HD
definition foundation and this is a
hella dark but I just mix it in so I put
the tiniest little dab like see I like
put them next to each other and then I
take my foundation brush and I will mix
them together because it gives me at the
right color skin and I won't put that
there
look how dark it is I promise a little
caramel this lighting is not looking
right I promise I don't look at this I'm
not change
okay who's that better can you guys tell
that it actually goes not really okay
then I highlight my face with the
instant age rewind when one of the men
even speaking English oh my god my arm
hurts so bad then I'm gonna take this
instant age rewind concealer and I'm
going to put this obviously under my eye
because every person on YouTube does
this and that's how I found it looks
good looks great then I'm gonna take the
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna blend
that in after that I'm going to take my
Bobbi Brown stick oh god I'll call this
a nail my Bobbi Brown foundation stick
in the shade golden or number six I'm
gonna lightly contour my face I really
don't over contour it just my cheekbones
so oh I forgot to do my nose I'm going
to do it like here to make it appear a
little smaller but honestly I don't know
what I'm doing I'm gonna just blend my
nose contour around with my finger
because Beauty Blender doesn't work as
well next I'm going to go in and set my
stuff and contour a little bit more so
I'm going to be taking my here I'm gonna
be taking my Kat Von D shade and light
palette which is my obsession I don't
know what I would have done without this
I'm gonna be taking at these do we have
a brush number 109 so I use this for
contour so I just dab it in this center
one right here and then I put it on my
cheeks
it looks really harsh right now but it
will definitely look blended later on I
say that about mom and they go oh my god
it looks so awful right now but I
promise her look better and you guys are
probably like I know how I didn't serve
I was doing shoot this is why I can't
even this is the Tarte bronzer in park a
princess I've used this for like years I
don't know it's like my favorite bronzer
I just put on my cheats and like blend
it together kind of then I'm going to
set my under eyes with the shade in the
middle right here yellowy shade just
gonna set my eyes now it's time for
blush I'm using the NARS blush in outlaw
which is like my new obsession love this
one so I'm using that I'm gonna take
this mineralized skinfinish by Mac and
it's in gold deposit it is like a
beautiful bronzy little gold color and
I'm gonna be taking this on a fan brush
so I put it there
you don't just tap it in put it right on
the cheeks so moving on to my eyebrows I
use the anastacio dip brow pomade and
soft brown just like every other basic
person and I take it on this little I
don't know what whose brush this is but
I use it um I'm gonna do my eyebrows off
camera because like I'm just filling
them in and it's hard to do on camera so
I do my eyebrows
I am home just ignore them
they'll be fixed next I am taking my
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion and
I am I think the you tiniest amount on
my finger because they don't use a lot
of this I don't know I just
don't utilize there's this much
literally this much I'm gonna put them
together that wipe it on my eyebrows my
eyebrows Wow my eyelid funny story the
other day I was at my car I was driving
to school and as I was in my car a mom
decided to fly out at my face like a
giant moth like this big it's like to
fly into my face and try and make me
wreck my car and really tried to
sabotage my day but I didn't let it
because I just started screaming and
squirting all over the road and then I
rolled the window down and I thought
that the moth went out but it really
didn't go out and three days later the
moth flew out of my car when I got in it
again so that was disgusting okay so the
reason that this is a full tutorial kind
of thing is because one it's fall right
now and two I posted this eyeshadow
palette on my Instagram which has the
most beautiful colors and it's beautiful
and you guys were like oh my god do like
tutorial with this and I was like okay
so I figured there are some colors I
could like make it well like fall you
know I'm taking the color free spirit
which is like just like a I don't know
basic little white color
putting this all over my eyelid because
I always put like a nude or like bone
skin color it's that even like a bone
just like what you do like what I'm
gonna be taking this color which is a
natural beauty and it's like a purple
pink mauve color and I'm just gonna be
putting this in my crease I really don't
do anything too crazy with this palette
but I really really like the purple
tones for fall so that's what I've been
doing there you go
I shadow it's done
hello I'm literally filming right now so
you're not on your way guess so whatever
I think it's fine I did it just say no
when I'm filming but just show up to my
house so then I'm gonna even say I'm
gonna take this force of nature which is
like a peachy color and I'm gonna put
this over top of that just because I
really really like layering these colors
like on top and then I'm gonna like
blend it upwards so that I don't have
too much of a distinct wine I'm gonna
I'm gonna do the same on the other
eyelid okay next I'm gonna be taking a
smaller brush and this is the 236 smokey
shader brush and I'm gonna take this
color right here it's called the best
friend and I'm literally taking not even
a lot of it because when I put dark
colors on my eyelid I like always end up
messing them up so I'm only taking a
little bit and I'm gonna put this right
here like right on the edge of the
crease take a little bit more and put it
right there so obviously I'm not living
it right now I'm just setting it there
and then I'm gonna blend it in a second
then I'm going to take the power player
color which is like almost a gray
version of this color right here and I'm
gonna put that right over top of it and
blend it in so that's basically that
from this palette then because I'm so
weird
and I really really like the white ish
shade from the naked smoky palette I
take the shade 13 which is this one
which is like Hello I take it and I
put it in the inner corner and I kind of
blend it in I'm really really into
putting white on the center of my eye
right now like on the center and inner
corner of my eye I don't know why well
I'm a rapper that's my eye shadow that's
my phone make up look
all done jokes next is eyeliner I am
taking that this is look lighter I am
taking the Maybelline New York master
precise by eye studio and I'm just gonna
draw a helmet thin line on my eyelid I'm
gonna do this off camera as well because
it's really hard then I'm taking the
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
mascara which I actually am really into
right now and you guys all know how to
apply mascara so I'm not even gonna like
explain how you do this but do you see
it the difference in my eyeball like
what I don't know
broken tell them what this is what is
this turns up I don't know I guess not
only dollars be down
open it damn I'm beautiful
okay I'm beautiful people decoded what
no I'm sorry about the distraction they
showed up to my house so last part of
this makeup tutorial is my lips and I
take my spice lip liner which is what I
always use and I'm just gonna fine
I'll take this mac lipstick it's matte
it's in the shade myrrh and it's a cute
pink purple tone so this is the final
makeup look and this is basically what
I've been doing all fall the foundation
the blush highlighter everything is
basically you know what I've been doing
all fall and then the lip color has
changed a little bit because I normally
don't do like a dark pink oh my god I
don't think I'll do a dark kind of pink
and I also kind of change the eye shadow
up so I hope you guys like this tutorial
I really not like the best person to
probably base your makeup expertise off
but this is how I do my makeup in a ton
of you guys requested this so I really
want to do something with the palette
that I use so that is how I made this
video if you guys liked it give it a
thumbs up I'm gonna leave all my social
media down below because I know a bunch
of you guys have been asking what my
Instagram and all that kind of stuff is
so it's always listed down below for you
guys to follow me on and yeah I think
that's it see you guys six week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
