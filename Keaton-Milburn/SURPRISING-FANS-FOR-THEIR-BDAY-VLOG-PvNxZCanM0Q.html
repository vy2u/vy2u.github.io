different kind of video I'm doing a blog
but I'm just going to be vlogging my day
because they some of my mom's sisters
friends daughters are one of them is
around 7:00 and then one of them I think
is younger but for their birthday they
were talking about wanting to meet me
for the birthday and then actually live
in Louisiana so today their mom told
them that they are coming to Houston to
go shopping and stuff and get lunch but
we me and my mother huh yeah for their
birthday but me and my mom are actually
going to be at this restaurant called
tiny boxwoods which is in Houston and
we're going to be like waiting there for
them and then when they come in we're
going to Surprise them so I'm surprising
her for their birthday one of them
starting ten and one of them seven so
that's what we're doing today so I
decided I would vlog it because I
figured it would be really cute and then
this is the step right mom
okay so this is like we got the beach
gifts so this is like those little lush
boxes you know what I'm talking about
they have like a bunch of the bath box
in it right and then I got these two
little bags and they're just like to put
the gifts that we picked out for them
and then and so I picked out a few
things that I thought like they would
like because it's like my favorites
video this is going up after so I guess
I can show you guys eight okay we've got
little socks because my dog this is the
dog that we have so we got them socks
and you guys know I love these socks
I bought these from verba 21 their socks
are the cutest things I always have such
funny things I bought like crab ones I
think I showed them in a video and then
you guys have maybe if you've been
subscribed for a long time seen these
mugs they're the no copy the Presto mugs
and then they have my Instagram name on
the back of them I use them and they
give away so I figured I would put in in
here because I don't know I just thought
it was cute and that they would like and
then I got them these brandy melville
necklaces because you guys know I'm
obsessed with brandy melville and they
have the cutest little jewelry so we got
those and then we got these little
and even has a little triangle and then
