going to be a tips pertaining video I'm
just gonna be telling you tips what you
can do while you're painting anything
like that because I've been tanning for
so much this summer I tan like every
other day and I have pretty pretty dark
if I do say so myself I've gotten pretty
dark and so I just thought I would share
these tips guys so you guys can get
wrong and people at home let's just get
right into it
first thing I'm going to be telling you
it's pretty much do's and don'ts
obtaining just tips that you can do
while you're painting and stuff like
that so the first thing is to alternate
it don't play on your back for a long
long period of time and two hands in
front of you and then the back half you
can write what I do is I set a timer for
35 minutes I see in the front side for
35 minutes and with my timer goes off I
switch and I D on the back side that way
I look even
and sometimes I tan the front a little
longer just because the boss
often so I like that to be a little bit
darker but other than that I do all to
martini least second thing is to use
sunscreen and I know that everybody like
that but I use sunscreen on my shoulders
and on like my nose and my cheeks and my
forehead and said because I don't like
that skin really burned and I don't and
my face you can't tell the rest of my
body is really really tan right now but
my face is a lot lighter because I don't
tan my face I like it I'll just put
makeup on it
but use sunscreen on your face and
and your ears because if your ear so
that's really really bad
don't use
put that on your skin it's pretty much
as baking there
moving oil so don't use that it's super
bad for you there what I use for tanning
is banana boat
and it's SPF for and I just use this
it's super DJ hops rubbin and I just
spray it and really really welcome me
these sunscreen that I use is also
Banana Boat ultra sunblock SPF 30 and it
is waterproof and has aloe vera and
fight a vitamin D in it and I just use
this again for my shoulders in my face
the third thing is to wear a hat I
probably always perhaps when I'm tanning
again because I don't like to get my
face really burnt and floppy hats are
really in right now so you can just get
it up uncheck floppy hats we really
really came together forever 21 and
stuff like that I use just this ball cap
if you saw
New York Hall much this wall cap and I
use this every single time when I tan I
just like ball caps better no Bobcats
are cuter
whatever these poor thing is to stay
hydrated always always drink water with
your teammate like literally if I don't
drink water and I've only been tanning
for like 30 minutes
and I stand up I'm so white headed just
because I sweat so much and you're
releasing so much up here excess water
that it just it's really really good to
stay hydrated you don't even have to
drink water you can drink a smoothie or
eliminate anything like that but just
don't drink soda and stuff has a lot of
sodium I just think it's better if you
drink water and lemonade make a smoothie
anything like that the fifth thing is to
take breaks for swimming so I always
always I will tan for 35 minutes on the
front 35 minutes on the back and then
I'm gonna go swimming and I swim for
like 5-10 minutes and then after that I
tan again and I just repeat that over
and over for a few hours and if you
don't have a sewing pool in your
backyard like I do you just get a water
hose
I wouldn't know
that's it I would you have ID enough
bullish lot easier that way these six
thing to do is use aloe vera or lotion
or something if you get sunburned if you
start peeling on your arms or your legs
or your face or anything use our here it
honors they have so much in it you so
good on your skin like I think that even
when I'm not number I'm just gonna put
out there on because it just feels so
good and it's like gel and it just like
is awesome so I'm gonna use aloe vera
the cauldron well this is just CBS brand
like aloe vera gel whatever it naturally
cools and soothes and softened my body
this is what I do
my dog so I just use this and it cools
my party off and it feels really good
and I love it and it's awesome and
that's cool
so now I'm gonna be tell you guys things
that you can do while you're changing
because I get really really bored when
I'm tanning like I literally want to die
what I'm tanning standing in such a
hassle so I need to I don't know I think
I'm a TD or something or ADHD whatever
it's called I can't cross the train they
can't see still for a really long time I
just lose my mind why need to always
find something to do and salute to
energy me while I'm tanning world out
there in died and so the first thing you
can do is read a book okay that's
probably the easy
do a lot of people complain that they
don't like bringing their bugs by the
pool
whatever you can now go on your phone
and get the app like there's an app for
everything now so just go on iBooks
whatever it is go to audible.com if you
don't even want to read you can just
don't listen to it with your headphones
it's literally so easy the second thing
is to listen to music which that is just
that's like my number one I always have
made to playing with art in it just
because I don't know it's just like I
just like it a lot and like what I'm
sitting there that musics playing I just
like picture myself I'm just like
dancing like in my head I just
which is great so
I suppose the third thing to do again
his sleep but make sure you set the
alarm because he's over sleeping here
and I'm crazy Dan line and the backing
is gonna be Bernie has been with why the
fourth thing to do is have a friend over
so I always invite a friend over that
but I always try and always try and
invite a friend over because it's a lot
easier and you can talk to them actually
person talk to you have conversations
with and not be bored and they'll go
swimming with you and they'll talk to
you got applied and you'll be came
together and you'll laugh and the time
will go by a lot quicker and you just
won't be as bored and it's a great the
fifth thing to do is watch Netflix and
you can watch Netflix either on your
phone or you can watch Netflix on the
computer I suggest on your phone or your
computer outside it's probably not a
very good idea
so watch orange is the new black or
whatever you want to watch on Netflix
and just makes time go by a lot quicker
and I've said it every single one of
these but I promise these are all like
time
they are and these six thing to do is
eat I eat want a me I don't eat like
crazy like five course meals but I'll
snack on all the times I just need a
little sleep put it in the blender and
so I like to do that anyways guys that
was all my tips for all of you I hope

I mean I'm right I don't think that's
very good ICF me I don't know I don't
know what do you guys believe
hope you enjoyed my dogs this video also
I filmed this outside because I just
didn't think that you film a tanning
video about like standing outside like
inside on my bed so I just own this
outside set that was easier probably
really better idea - sweaty and itchy
and like it's really gross right now
but anyways again thanks guys so much
