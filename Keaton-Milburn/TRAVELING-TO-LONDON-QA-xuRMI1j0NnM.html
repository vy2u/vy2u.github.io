and haven't done one of these in a while
my last one was a relationship Q&amp;amp;A so
it's all on relationships but this time
I'm not going to do like a certain topic
I'm just going to be answering a lot of
you guys questions because I had like
500 something questions on tumblr and
then I have like 400 on my Instagram so
I'm just going to be going through those
and if i don't answer your question then
i would probably get around to it in my
next video but i do get a lot of the
same questions if you haven't seen any
of my other cuties and you have a
question I didn't answer you can go
watch one of those if you could have one
thing in the world right now what would
that one thing be um I think right now
hmm I would want a private plane like my
own private plane because I don't want
any trouble travel travel so much this
summer and like every day I'm like oh my
gosh I want to be here or I want to be
there and I just want to travel a lot
but if I had my own private plane I
could just wake up and be like today I'm
gonna go to I don't even know just make
up some random place but I would love
that okay on the topic of traveling if
you could travel to one place tonight
where would you go um if I go to one
place tonight I know you probably be
like oh like parrots Tamar in Europe but
I would seriously just want to go to
like LA because obviously Howie lives
there and I want to see Ali and I don't
know I've just really been wanting to go
to LA a lot and I just I just I just
want to be in LA like right now I think
the summertime is like perfect for like
being there like doing a bunch of cool
things but I can't go right now what is
your most embarrassing story ok I have
been trying to think about this I
honestly like I get embarrassed
obviously everyone gets embarrassed but
I don't get embarrassed that much like
sometimes if I like if I get embarrassed
I'm just like I'm over it like I don't
like stress a lot about it just cuz like
I don't know embarrassing things happen
all the time one time it was like my
freshman year and there was like all
these seniors like it was like I had no
idea what I was doing I was like and I
suppose my freshman year and I was going
up the stairs and they were like all
these senior guys going up ahead of me
like and I was like walking behind them
and I fell going like up the stairs so I
like I felt and I caught myself my shin
like kissed the stairs oh my gosh and
then they all turned around they were
like are you okay that was just like and
I'm so nerdy and like not cute and that
was pretty embarrassing that was real I
always liked think about that I'm like I
bet you they thought I was so lame I
fell going up this dear if you could
spend a whole day with anybody in the
world who would it be i think i would
have to pick either miley cyrus because
like her Instagram post I absolutely
love Miley Cyrus wore my plane was a
piano absolutely love Miley Cyrus and
just to see like what goes on and her
like everyday life like her Instagram
poses so she posed I'm like what are you
like what are you doing every single day
like that would be so fun miley cyrus
selena gomez because I mean like
slitting almost super thick hello or
Kylie Jenner because everyone loves
Kylie Jenner and I always like see all
her snapchats and stuff so just be cool
to like be there with her like see what
she's doing I don't know what is your
favorite thing about summer not having
plants i got know it sounds weird but
it's like you can wake up like yeah okay
let guys like camping like vacations and
stuff but like you can wake up during
the day and be like like I have nothing
to do it like it's just like an open
opportunity with like schools like okay
have to wake up it and every single time
you want to play it something it's like
it has to be after school or like on the
weekend and I like waking up in the
summer and like what are we having
something like absolutely nothing just
being like I could sit here all day or I
can go do this I don't know it's fun
favorite show ok so my favorite show at
the moment I just started watching
season 3 of oranges new black so I
really really like that right now but i
also am watching parks and rec and i
love that show like I think it's so
funny i love the humor in it which a lot
of people say the office is better like
all this stuff but i have never I've
never watched office but I really really
like parks and rec and
this one is one is your favorite bible
verse and I know you guys think that I
should have my favorite bible verse
memorized which I kind of do but
everyone on YouTube is so crazy and I
say like one wrong word in my favorite
bible verse then everyone's gonna flip
out on me like straight-up reading from
do you guys a day my favorite bible
verse is first annual 16-7 and it's but
the lord said to see on oh do not
consider his appearance on her side for
i have rejected the Lord does not look
at the things that people look at people
will get the outward appearance but the
Lord looks at the heart and I really
really like that verse because because I
know someone's can comment as me that is
like that is something that I like try
my hardest to live I is to not look at
the outward appearance of someone but
like looking at their heart and I feel
like with a lot of celebrities and even
like youtubers it's easy to look at like
their videos I don't know if you guys if
you guys just watched Ingrid Nelson's
video for coming out and stuff it's easy
to look at their outward appearance to
think that there's someone else but
really like their heart is different
than how they appear to be so I really
really like that verse because that's
something like I want to live by and I
try my best to live by could you imagine
living somewhere else in the world for a
year and if so where so if i could live
somewhere else like if it was like
studying abroad it's something like that
i feel like i would want to live in
london I've always wanted to go to
London I don't know why living there for
a year and like seeing like how they do
all their stuff I don't know I feel like
that'd be really cool so I won't do that
but it's the best concert you have ever
been to I think one of the best concerts
i've ever been to I've been to like a
lot of good concerts because like I'm
not like a concert junkie like there's
some people that go just like a bunch of
concerts like every single concert but
when I go to concerts it's like people
that like I really really like I
seriously love like Ed Sheeran is
probably one of my favorite and like I
went to I went to One Direction concert
like three years ago when they first it
was a good first tour I went on that and
that was probably one of the best
concerts i've ever been to accredit that
one too Katy Perry was really really
good I don't I'm not like obsessed with
her but her show was like really really
good
it's probably one of them but i think
i'd share in like one direction are like
up there what blogs are you doing this
summer um okay so I hate keeping things
to surprise but it's more fun like that
I'm going on a trip july seven through
the 14th and I'm going on another trip
the 20th through the 27th and then from
the 27 to the 30th no whoa that'd be
dumb 27th to like the first or something
like that of August I'm going on another
so i think i'm going to be blogging all
of those trips for you guys when the
time comes of like trips then you guys
will know what it is but i want to be
everything to be a surprise and i want
you guys to like I don't know oh wait

videos planned for while i'm on a trip
