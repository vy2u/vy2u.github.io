to be a try on haul and I really like
doing these for you guys because you
guys like watching them they're a lot
more exciting than me just holding up
the t-shirt or whatever it is and
showing it to you so you guys know I'm
gonna show you stuff from different
stores I've recently got clothing from
and I'll show you guys what it looks
like on okay so the first thing I want
to start with is brandy melville and so
this top is just a white top and it is
open back and it ties really nice in the
back I just like it because it's super
dainty and thin and I think that it's
gonna be really cute in the summer with
just a pair of cute blue jean shorts or
whatever I just thought it was really
adorable and you can dress it up this is
also another white top and this is
awesome from brandy and it just ties in
the front again I don't know I just
thought it would be really cute it's
like peplum is that it's not the name
but like the style of this I know what
it's called but it's just a flowy white
top and how I actually bought this for
me because she was like I think you
would like this and I do I love it
velocity I got from brandy is this black
long-sleeve leotard top and you can't
tell that it's alliy turn right here but
it is so comfortable the material of
this is so great you know brandy stuff
is always amazing and I just love the
lobby I've been looking for a cute top
like that and then when I saw there was
a leotard I was like perfect so I post a
few pictures in this on my Instagram
which you guys were like I love that the
next items are from Urban Outfitters you
guys know I literally can't even walk
into urban office without buying at
least like two things I have a problem
but I bought this and this is just a
gray like I don't know if it crosses in
the front and it's a cross gray top it
has a little tie in the back I don't
know why everything has ties on it right
now I'm just realizing that but I just
really liked this because it's casual
but you can also like dress it up a lot
and make it look kind of nicer with some
jewelry and then this top I'm obsessed
with so and this is the yellow top that
I wore in my last video and you guys
like oh my gosh
that you could count on you yellow is my
favorite color
first of all and every single time I
don't own a lot of yellow things because
it's like a hard color to wear but every
single time I wear yellow I get so many
compliments so and then getting to wear
yellow more which you guys will see you
later on when I get interested this haul
but I love this top and the brand is
actually cheap Monday but I got it at
Urban Outfitters but I I love cheap
Monday stuff as well um the next two
things are neckties because they're just
such a trend guys so the first one is
just a regular bandanna and I bought
this tan bandanna just because I was
like I don't know I feel like it's a
look and I wanted to try it out and I
didn't want to buy like a black man in a
red bandanna I just I don't know I
thought tan would be cute and then the
other one that I got is actually like a
silk ish like satin one and it has
flowers all over it and I don't know
it's so it's so nice the material of it
I really love and I just thought this
would be cute with like jeans and like a
nice little like tan crop top or black
crop tops something like that actually I
think I paired this in one of my um in
my concert get rid of me that you guys
are gonna see I have this in an outfit
and they love it okay so the next items
I have are from Lulu's and you guys know
I absolutely love Lulu's they have so
many cute trendy things for summer right
now I just I'm obsessed
like I can't even get enough this is
just a black off the shoulder top but I
really like this because it's flowy and
I can tuck the like the front part of it
into my jeans or my shorts or something
like that but still have like I don't
know it just looks flowy and it doesn't
make me look too too big and I'm super
into like off-the-shoulder things right
now so this is another black off the
shoulder top but this one is way more
fitted I can wear this one and the
sleeves on this one are shorter so I can
wear more jewelry and like bracelets and
stuff like that so I love this next I
have a dress and I thought this would be
super cute just for this summer because
I've been wanting to buy more like I
don't know if you're just wanting buy
like Sun dresses and cute things and
robbers and stuff that I can just throw
on and the
so this one I feel like also makes me
look so tan it is just a teal dress it
has this little line in the back I don't
know I love it I like that it's open
back and I think you can dress it up
differently like you can wear it like
out to like lunch or something with like
booties and like jewelry or you can just
throw it on when you're going to the
beach there's tons of different ways
that you could style this and it's just
so basic so I really love that next I
have this romper and I love all of the
green especially because I feel like it
also makes me look super tan colors like
this make me look a lot darker and I
love the sleeves on this one I just feel
like it gives me such a like bohemian
vibe and I love the color and it's not a
dress it's a romper which I like because
I like having like room parts are just
more comfortable I feel way more like
secure and then when I wear rompers and
so I just really really loved this this
yellow dress it's like a low V in the
front and it is super super long and
it's just I don't know I just think it's
so pretty it has this beautiful tie in
the back and I'm actually going to my
friend's graduation party and it's a Tea
Party and so when I saw this I was like
this is so cute I have to wear this to
the Tea Party I just didn't think this
dress makes me feel so girly it's like
yellow and like flowy I just never
really have stuff like this so I thought
that this would be perfect for that to
party so you'll probably see me a bloody
picture than this so the lots of things
I got from Lulu's are shoes and they
have so many cute heels on their website
I was looking at all their shoes and I
was just like can I have every pair I
don't know why I'm in such a like he'll
face right now in my life but I just
like love heels so I got these and these
are just new to heels I just really
liked the way they have like the three
that I like straps on the top I like the
material of them the heels not too high
I just really liked these heels and I
figured I can dress them up different
ways I love wearing like heels and jeans
in like a cute little top I think that's
like such a cute look so I love that so
the second pair of heels
I'm actually obsessed with like I tried
them on right when they came in the mail
and I was like these are the best things
ever so they're these Steve Madden like
suede like oh they're so beautiful
they're just nude tan I like nude heels
I never really wear like black heels
anything like that I love nude so I got
these and the heel is perfect because
because it's so like thick it's not hard
for me to walk in these and I just love
them they fit me perfectly so that is
all for my tran haul I hope you guys
