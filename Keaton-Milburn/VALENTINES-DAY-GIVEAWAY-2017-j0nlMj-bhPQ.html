be as you can see by the title a
giveaway and I am so excited to be doing
a giveaway because I haven't done that
giveaway and so so long and this
giveaway that I'm doing is actually the
same first giveaway that I ever did and
basically I'm doing this giveaway on
Valentine's Day so the winner will be
picked on Valentine's Day and that is
because I am single a lot of my viewers
are single and I know this because you
guys let me know you're like oh my god
Valentine's Day whatever so I decided
that I am going to be your Valentine so
on Valentine's Day I'm going to be
picking a winner and you guys will be
receiving all the stuff I'm going to
show you it's not anything that's like a
freaking TV and a MacBook and like all
this crazy stuff it's just something I
put together so you guys understand that
you guys are all my Valentines you guys
are amazing and I appreciate you guys so
much so I just wanted to give one of you
guys a little something on Valentine's
Day so that you guys understand how much
you guys really really mean to me so
yeah anyway
let's get into the products so I am
really ratchet right now and all the
products are just in this big black bag
but I will have like a cute little
makeup bag that I'm gonna put all the
makeup in later so when you guys get the
packaging like don't worry it's not
gonna be ratchet but the majority of
this stuff I am giving you guys is
makeup so let's get into the makeup okay
to start off I'm going to be showing you
guys what I have from covergirl so first
off I have two lip colors these are
actually outlast all-day intense so one
of them is like the lip color and then
the other side is the gloss and this
one's really pretty it's a really pretty
berry color and then this one is pink
and then the other end is berry I think
it's really really cute especially for
Valentine's Day and just in general
they're really pretty colors so I'm
gonna be having these so next up because
I'm not really sure what shade eyebrows
I'm gonna be giving this to but these
are two I like eye brow fillers I don't
even know how to describe them but
basically you can fill shape and define
your brows with these so I have this in
soft brown and black because I'm not
exactly sure who I'm going to be giving
a to see these
- along with that are these two brow
products the same in like blondish brown
and then black and this is like a brow
gel but it also is tinted so it can help
your brows stay in place which I really
really love these I also have a lot of
these products that I'm giving you guys
so I know that they are good I'm not
just giving you some random products the
next two items are from covergirl and
these are two lip colors this one is a
light pink and this one is a darker red
um they're both really really pretty at
pigmented and I love Leah steel
beginning these two and then the last
thing from covergirl is a so glass sheet
mascara and I've talked about this I've
also posted it on the Instagram I love
this mascara and I have like two other
ones with this in my drawer right now
and I use them all the time so those
will be getting a mascara I have three
glosses from Urban Decay so this one is
they're all like a new dish pink but
they're all different shades of pink you
know me and my new D pings like I love
them so the first shade is actually walk
of shame which okay all the names of
these are actually really ratchet the
next one is liar but this one's really
pretty it's a deeper pink this one a
super pale pink and then this one is
like BAM like this is very Valentine's
Day and this one is love child so these
are really really good glasses from
Urban Decay and then I added two other
random lip products just because I
really like them so this one is from
Lime Crime and this is in the shade
saddle this is one of their most popular
lip colors and it's so so pretty like it
looks good on anyone it's just a really
pretty it's a deeper nude it's like
almost brown it looks really really good
so I figured I would include this
instead of all just pink lip colors and
then this one is a nude lip pencil or
matte lip crayon I said lip pencil but
it's really really pretty so I'm gonna
be including that and then the last lip
product is from Maybelline and this is
actually a lip color palette so it has
all of these which I think are gorgeous
and I don't know it just looks really
Valentine's Day so I was like oh my god
yes
include this but I also forgot from
covergirl I am giving you guys the true
Naked palette jewels like this isn't
jewels pot so it has really really
pretty shimmers in here and also has a
few mats and this is just a really
pretty palette I figured I would include
next up are also 2 eyeshadow pellets
from elf cosmetics so the first one is
ok the first one is just really pretty
it has a few shimmery shades if you mats
are just nude eyes and then the next one
is a clay eyeshadow Pelt which this
one's really cool I've actually used
this one a lot and it is a more neutral
it says necessary nudes that's like the
name of this palette and that's a really
really pretty palette I know it's small
but it's actually really good next is an
eyeshadow palette by Smashbox and the
casing on this like oh my gosh guys this
one's so cool so this is actually a
gorgeous palette like look I know that I
know it's kind of small but guys like
the colors in this palette I have a
deeper they have like 4 shades of these
this is actually the Shay Mitchell
Smashbox collection and it's really
pretty like how she created all this and
especially the casing so I figured I
would include this and then the last
three makeup products are from Mac and
they are strobing liquids I love these I
have these and a few other shades and so
I was like oh my gosh wait they need
these so this is a light pink one this
is a deeper pink one and then this is a
silver one the silver one is a bomb and
these are honestly just strobing liquids
you can use for anything you can use
them as a highlighter over your makeup
under your makeup any kind of like I
don't know any kind of look you're going
for to make a little bit more of a
doobie and glowy effect these are
amazing so that is all for the makeup
products I dig I like to other like
really just small things just to include
in there so I got you guys some socks
because guys you already know me and my
socks I got these really cute once they
have hearts on them they say kiss me
sweet talk nice girl I don't know
there's just like little candy hearts
and I thought this was cute for
Valentine's Day and then I got you guys
a candle from Bath and Body Works this
one is so cute like look at the little
packaging I don't know why but I love
that they changed the packaging and this
one is Georgia Peach oh my god guys this
smells so good I don't think you
understand like this is so bomb and you
guys this is probably my favorite thing
like forget the makeup this candle is
bombed so that is everything and they
give away again like I said it's nothing
super dramatic I just wanted to
