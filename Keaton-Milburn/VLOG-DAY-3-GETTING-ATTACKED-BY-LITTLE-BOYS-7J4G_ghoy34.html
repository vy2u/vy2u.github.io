but we are on our way to Sorento taking
a three hour bus ride so we just made
our first stop how long we been driving
like an hour and rough yeah right
Iceland this is like syllabus ooh yes
light beer buffs like these but you know
but a lot of people don't have buggies
either but this look like they're like a
giant gas station so where you're
getting snacks and I'm getting a
cappuccino because I'm gonna have to
wake up and put some makeup off and then
we're gonna get through so we get on a
boat and go to Capri hating on the boat
this transformation is so the left you
literally the last video they just saw
me in a video makeup on has much to make
this tutorial yeah I use it a
the biggest struggle for my life and my
mom braided my hair please shout out to
mom I look naked Colleen said hello how
I feel about being on this bus I could
give him a point

feeling Carol how are you Ally
Natalie drew thank you
okay so we're taking this mess to Capri
and then when we better yeah we're right
okay we're not riding the bus we're
taking a ferry and then when we ride the
ferry well beyond Capri
I do my best to find some kind of glow
I'm giving it some hot and
from the darkest grace do I get I love
it it's so pretty seriously like that
hey I think that tour was probably like
the coolest thing I've ever been on and
like that sanctuary yeah it was very
cool I was like in that cave I don't
know if I videoed it but I was like the
coolest experience also I apologize for
all of us in the video and it fails for
saying capris and not happy because
someone's going to come and be like
that's how you say it cuz it's kept we
like colleges and it frees our pants so
I'm sorry no hate comments with a long
face without was super cool that way
you see my words yet you see some more
than me
the Black Watch
this is the most beautiful place I've
ever been in my whole life I swear to
you this is insane just walking through
here it's like oh my god it's so cute oh
this is the restaurant we're eating at
oh my God look at this lunch oh we are
all starving

do I go about eating this you gotta sign
dessert and it's like is it your masu oh
yeah yeah it is
is it good cameras autofocus but it
looks good me and Regan just got sprayed
with some lovely beer to you by the CIA
in place in the entire world I've never
ever looked like one where are we oh

finesse and find a sugar daddy so that
we can live here for the rest of our
life Vicki's right yeah this is the most
beautiful place I've ever been

longest walk in my life

Oh mom how you feelin good whoo we are
again making the longest ride with all
this stuff I like a fabulous view is
Regan how you feelin about this walk in
my exercise Kiner expensive dragwon
gelati gelati but this is making me
realize how out of shape I am for
walking all the way up here to our hotel
and so we didn't have to bring our like
full suitcases we packed like overnight
bags which are like backpacks and little
things so
that was good hey so sorry wait guys
whoa that is a cubed so honestly I can't
complain this were like in Sorrento but
this hotel all the hotels are staying
out obviously are not like a luxury
hotel because there's a big group of us
and we also booked this through a tour
guide so it's not gonna be like some
fancy hotel but this is just so funny
like honestly it's more fun this way is
it experience let me show you guys the
restroom here's the restroom I think
honestly I just think the restrooms are
weird because our toilets are not like
this like the thing is up there and this
is the toilet and then we also like
don't clean our buckets with this at
home and then this shower is weird
because like there's not a showerhead
it's like you wash yourself with that
and then some strain is here I don't
know what that's for let me know what
that's for please in the comments below
hello this is a blow dryer as well but I
probably not going to use it um this is
the room
lovely well what is good is we have this
little porch out here this is cute
say hey drew what is that dance and then
the guys are next door who are out here
here's the pool and the rest of the
hotel that's also deceptive so nice guys
we are going clubbing who's excited I
hate all of you guys this is your moment
Zak everyone this is your moment on the
vlog tonight is the night outfit all of
y'all so lion shirts I really like that
y'all coordinated this though yes I'm
gonna put you on hey I don't know y'all
look Mia Turin Noah anyway we're going
to the club tonight
and the party I'm probably not because
I'd say Monday nights I've no one is
probably gonna be there but we're gonna
make it fun but in Italy yeah yeah but
we're in no doubt like say bye
want you to talk about your personal
experience about this club that way he
just went to okay so we just went to a
club I'm losing my voice but it was
filled with almost thirteen year old
there was a few eleven year olds
probably that my husband there's
literally it was not even teen night -
Letterman they tried to they were
attacked packing I for at one point it
was little Natalia in not even in boys
are very brave they were wild they were
literally tackling us like st. and every
time keen without her camera they was
like oh it was like it was the end of
the world like literally if I took my
camera out they thought this was like
the widest thing ever so you guys saw
that that was seriously so odd but that
was so much fun like I'm so happy like I
don't even have a voice anymore might
actually really loved it so he
recommended
I do my best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
