freaking pumped about it so I figured I
would vlog the game today just some like
really quick like background on our
football team so we actually haven't on
our school for that long this is the
first time we've ever gotten to state
and so it's like really really important
because the guys like playing on the
football team or some of like my best
friends I've been like cheering for them

like seventh grade so it's just like
really really important to me so I
figured I would vlog it and you guys can
kind of see our student section and
stuff like that but yeah so I don't
believe logging not today but right now

present I'm not gonna film that cuz if
holly watches this and she doesn't get
to see so I wrapped some presents and I
took a bath and stuff like that like
plain stuff but now I am on my way to my
school because I'm dropping off some of
the football players stuff like one of
them needs safety pins and then we make
little goodie bags for them so I'm
dropping off Colleen's goodie bag that
she made for one of the guys on our team
