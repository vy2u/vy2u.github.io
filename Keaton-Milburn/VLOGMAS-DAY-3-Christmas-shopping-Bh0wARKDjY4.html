you guys have been asking me to do that
so I'm probably gonna do that soon I've
literally transformed into a librarian
Brandon like I have to I had to take my
contacts out because they were like so
dry that I couldn't see anything
so put my glasses on and my hair is
parted down the middle because it's
straight and it looks really bad when
it's part to the sides tree and I'm
wearing Mama's sweater and I'm wearing
her shoes I look like a librarian we're
gonna go to the mall and get um
Christmas presents because he has to get
some too and then but we're gonna eat
before because I'll potentially eat my
arm off alright I'm cute instead brother

coming and you I thought you were just
gonna interrupt me that I didn't turn it
hit me in the face oh yeah
it's a jellyfish but we're walking to
the mall and we're gonna get some
Christmas gifts and then Landon I didn't
tell I didn't actually tell him that I
was going to smash burger but he ended
up coming into smash burger the same
time that I was at the most prepare what
so what a clingy boyfriend so girls

bought this little cave so they can swim
in it and then I bought I don't know I

fish boat really isn't that big so
probably not big enough double this
stuff but then
my god it's oh I bought black gravel
because I don't know I didn't want
colourful gravel or white gravel so I
just got black gravel so I thought that
and I'm so excited hopefully they like
me more but I gave him some stuff to uh
swim with I just got home and I want to
fill up my little fish bowl with its new
little stuff so I'm gonna put them in
this sink
