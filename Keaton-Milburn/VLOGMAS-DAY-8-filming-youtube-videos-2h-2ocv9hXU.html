family this hey kid you suck
team waffle all day what's up Gucci
waffle squad reppin it's a CAD doing
this money yeah we finished our morning
routine it said like two hours didn't it
take a long time it's gonna be looking
sharp thanks to Jamie and Hannah and me
are gonna go to the Galleria and turn up
am i right
mom what are you gonna do here when we
leave you today is just a very boring
day of editing all day long I have like
three things to edit so I'm doing that
but I also just wanted to say um a lot
of you guys commented on my video asking
me where my dad was I have a stepdad cuz
it's like in all my blogs it's like me
my mom like my sister and Hannah or
whatever I have a set that and he lives
here with us and he has been hunting for
the past five days so that's why he
hasn't been in any of the vlogs
yes he's home now but he's at work so
he's obviously not in this and then also
you guys were asking me of course as my
sister Chris's not my sister but she is
like one of my best friends since like a
very long time so she's basically my
sister that's why she comes in our house
whenever she feels like it cuz we don't
really care but yeah that's basically it
how's your big coming along looking good
looking good mine is like exporting or
whatever it's doing right now
let me explain to you okay explain there
is Christmas Eve and then there's
Christmas Eve Eve so it's the E
of Christmas Eve that's not it today
that is just too much you just need to
have a Christmas Eve so when it's
Thanksgiving is it Thanksgiving eat eat
yeah no no so there's no such thing as a
Christmas Eve yesterday me and Hannah
ordered pizza and I because I watched
Criminal Minds and like everything I
think that everyone is going to murder
me like anyone I go and count like in
contact with I'm like you're probably a
murderer so when we ordered pizza we had
to pay the guy when he came to the door
and he was like this older guy he was a
prat he's like and he's like fifty and
he came to the front door okay maybe
like forty seven fifty and he was at the
door and I was so scared cuz it was just
me and Hannah and no one was here and as
I'm walking to the door I was like hey
Dad the pizza's here
and so I pretended that there was a man
here so he didn't get me and he didn't
get me so you know what oh that's the
point of this story all I gotta say is I
was almost murdered and now I just want
to show you guys the struggle is right
now trying to edit videos I just want to
import some footage onto my iMovie so
that I can use it to edit and it's
literally taking five hours so I'm gonna
have to go find something to do for five
hours I'm probably gonna watch the
following you watch it you leaving yeah
bye guys say bye but while I'm waiting I
think I'm going to take down this frame
right here and I'm gonna put up a bunch
of Polaroids and I haven't never put up
before so I think I'm gonna put those
all along my wall and then I have a
picture of James Dean that I think I'm
gonna put in front of that or over here
in this corner so that's what I'm gonna
do while I'm waiting on my footage and
I'm obviously gonna watch the following
so I give a lot of you guys questions on
tumblr I get like 15 questions a day
which doesn't seem like a lot but it's
really hard to answer like when you're
doing stuff and you're out and like
everything like that so I'd like to take
at least like twice a week to sit down
on my computer and just like go through
the questions and I start from the very
bottom all the way to the top to most
so if you guys have asked me any
questions like in the past week and I
haven't answered it don't worry I will
answer it it just takes time I always
get questions saying like I sent you a
question you have an answer date like
what's wrong
I always start from the oldest and I
work my way up to the recent and I do it
at least twice a week where answer you
guys questions just because I like to
like go through it thoroughly and like
answer them like real answers not just
on my phone real quick so yep that's
what I do so if you guys have any
questions that you ever want to ask me
my tumblr is always listed below and
always at the end of my videos so you
guys can ask me anything you want to ask
me there so it's done now it's not
perfectly even but I tried my best but
that's all of them I don't know I think
it's really cute I think it's much
better than just having the frame up
there although I don't really know what
I'm gonna do with this yet because I
don't know I don't know what I'm gonna
do I don't know what I could use is for
I could use it I was like a project and
like make it into something I don't know
I'm not really able to do anything on my
computer or like watch Netflix or watch
the following because my computer
downloads a lot faster when I'm not
doing anything on it so I'm trying not
to touch it I'm just gonna let it export
and but it take its time and do whatever
basically I'm making YouTube videos and
being a youtuber I don't really consider
myself a youtuber just because like I
don't know I just I've never called
myself a youtuber I just don't really
think that I am I think I just make
videos because I like doing it but
anyway um I think that making videos
literally consist like 87% of the time
is exporting downloading uploading any
of that stuff takes up about a 7 percent
of my time and the rest of the time I am
editing and that's about it
Hannah over here you look like you're
literally drinking a beer turn up Hannah
requested this meal which is like our
fave it's what is it shrimp linguini
yeah it's very good so we're having that
and then some salad look at these
beautiful cupcakes wait I think this are
those
government in like mocha chocolate like
chocolate peppermint right yes this
these I don't know
gingerbread rush those are the best no I
can't even eat this tonight that cuz I
feel sick I just like chow down on some
pasta
Keeton Keeton do the move Keeton do they
do the move that Landon taught you you
better back up knock it out of my head
randomly during the day I turned into
the Hulk it was the craziest thing I
just wanted to show you guys that and we
have this drawer in our kitchen this is
the drawer I went to I get some scissors
and I just guys this is the kind of game
apart and now we no longer have a do
it's 11 o'clock now and I'm halfway
through editing my
morning routine video and then tomorrow
morning I need to start editing my video
from today like right away so I can
upload it and then I'm gonna take some
pictures but um that's all I hope you
