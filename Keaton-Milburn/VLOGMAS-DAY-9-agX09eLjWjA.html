9 it's Christmas Eve I'm so happy I've
been up since like 8:45 I set my alarm
for 8:45 just because I am editing my
morning routine video and I know it's
gonna take me a long time and I have
other stuff to do today so I want to try
and get that done and then I have to
edit another video and it's been two
hours since I have been editing this
video so hopefully it all comes together
and I can get some others I've done
today
my mom just walked in here literally
like she was trying to show me some
video but she told me I need to vlog it
before she plays it so I'm very scared
what was that my dad who just sent me
this my grandpa just sent my mama's he
sent this to all the grandkids like the
little ones okay actually believe in
Santa I guess why do you do that I got
dressed up in that suit what is in it
it's like a board like anything or
something I don't understand so I went
and got ready and like did my makeup and
stuff because it's one right now and by
the time that we go to the mall which is
where we're going to get our early
Christmas present we are gonna go there
and it's probably gonna take a really
long time because it's Christmas Eve Pez
they don't take so long I decided I'll
just get ready now and then at 3:30 I'll
have my makeup and stuff and all I'll
have to do is change and get rid say
hello hello we are getting ready to go
to the Christmas Eve bash party there's
my mother oh that jacket is very cute
where did you get that how are you
where'd you get that this is very
effective is my mom's extensions I'm all
mostly wear a ball gown tonight
um I'm wearing my mother's clothes
that's why we're in her room because we
like to steal her clothes and wear them
and pretend they're ours and I'm wearing
her shoes and I'm not technologically
challenged here was look at that side
waiter so everybody say hello this is
