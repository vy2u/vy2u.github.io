week in my life video
forget into this week's video I want to
give a big shout-out to Dermalogica for
sponsoring this video I'm super excited
because I'm gonna be showing you guys
these two products the first one being
the breakout clearing booster and the
blackhead clearing fizz mask I'm going
to be using these throughout the week
and you guys will see at the end of my
week how my skin looks how much it
clears up and I'm super excited to
experience this and show you guys like
literally every single day the steps of
my skin transform you guys are always
asking so if you guys also want I will
link all the products down below you
guys can check them up for yourselves
they're only 21 dollars so super
affordable so yeah I'm gonna be showing
you guys that but first since it is the
morning I just made my coffee I'm just
gonna watch a little bit of Gossip Girl
get ready for the day that's how I start
my mornings I'm actually on the second
to last episode of Gossip Girl this is
my third time watching Gossip Girl all
the way through like I've seen every
season three times so I'm almost on the
finale I'm like am I gonna watch it a
fourth time like am I gonna be that
person so you know I just woke up
because my hair looks like so nappy so
before I could do my makeup and stuff I
am going to use the blackhead clearing
his mask and I focus it where I get
blackheads and where my pores are like
where most of my makeup stays in my
pores because this helps clear your
pores and it gets rid of the blackheads
before they turn into like a big pimple
that makes sense I just put this on it's
not like a mask that you leave on for
like 15 minutes like it's not like that
you guys can see it on my skin but you
feel it working so the coolest feeling
like it feels like little bubbles like
all over but that's how I know what's
working anyway I'm gonna leave this on
and then afterwards I'm gonna apply this
onto my problematic areas on my face
which means that this pimple this pimple
they gotta go Oh once you keep that on
for like three to five minutes you just
so now I'm gonna go in with my breakout
clearing booster put it on to all the
areas that are not cute I liked I can do
this before I get ready because it
doesn't over dry my skin it just works
too came about to go to brunch this is
my outfit it's very so basic this tea is
from urban outfitters it's like a
project social tea my bail and then
these boyfriend jeans and Nikes also
just realized that I guess I have washed
with these so much that I ripped all the
I don't even know what that's called
fringe and it's like a huge hole now in
the side of my pad so I'm just gonna put
my purse here and cover that up because
I don't like it here's our breakfast
brunch lunch whatever Beckham
there's moana there's Stacey happy
birthday oh you're looking good
all these pancakes though your cancel
goodbye anyone on the log wanted me
child
if anyone wants to take in
Bruna
I know
hey guys I just want to document that I
do have friends there here there is a
Bri over there that's one friend this is
another friend right here so yeah I'm
not alone all week okay guys we just
laid in bed and watched a lot of I'm
vlogging by the way we eat just later
man watched a lot of Netflix but because
it's Monday its Bachelorette Monday guys
this is the best part about it being
Monday is that we get to go watch The
Bachelorette so that's we're gonna go do
busted nose busted face yeah well I
would like to see him hey guys okay so
I'm home now I'm exhausted and I'm going
to bed so I'm going to use like freak
out things rooster because obviously as
you can see on my face I have so many
problematic areas like I can't even I
can't handle it
I don't know what to do alrighty time to
go to bed I'll see you guys tomorrow
good morning I hate the way my voice
sounds in the morning I have some
filming I need to do today I think I
want to film to video say I'm going to
try and film to video say but that just
means I have to get ready for them and
put on makeup and stuff and then I have
a hairstyles concert tomorrow with tips
so excited about so I have the Harry
Styles concert and I need to pick out an
outfit because I don't know what I want
to wear and concert outfits are my
favorite and I know I have a lot of
clothes like as you can see but I really
want to go to the mall and look for
something that's better
so I'm also can go to the mall today now
that I've washed my face everything I'm
gonna use my Gemological clear start
break out cleansing booster again to use
it you do the bottom I like to put it on
my finger you can put it just like
directly on
but I'm just gonna put up my oh my
figure and put it where I need you the
good thing about this is that I can put
it on now and let it sit on my skin and
it works in like 15 minutes it kills
bacteria and your pimples and all that
stuff in 15 minutes
so I know I'm gonna put makeup on later
but at least I know that it will have
work before I put my makeup on and stuff
like that and I'm not gonna put makeup
on right now but I'll know that once I
already put this on it only takes 15
minutes for it to kill the bacteria
that's in the pimples and everything so
I may not have that many this one that
bro has gotta go
now I'm just going through emails I'm
gonna read a few of these while I have
my coffee and my big ol like normal
getting ready and I just watched Lauren
Elizabeth's makeup tutorial it's like
her summer makeup tutorial and it
honestly looks really good on her like
it's a cool idea but that just does not
work for me she looks like a tented
moisturizer on and like a little bit of
concealer and then she's like okay I'm
done like looks great and I'm like I
need about seven more layers of makeup
then she put on her face and so I'm
doing my makeup today and I'm gonna try
and use like minimal products but it's
just it's not gonna work I already know
that I'm gonna end up having like a full
beat because I can't do like minimal
makeup I try so hard I just feel like it
doesn't look good on me maybe I'll try
it one day for a video but today is not
the day now my makeups done all done
like a new woman oh you can see my
reflection back there hey girl um so now
I'm gonna pick out an outfit to wear for
my try on haul that I'm filming I'm
gonna film me trying on all the clothes

tried them all on and I love them I just
want to try them all on again for the
video but I did pick out a top to wear
something that's like summery cute
behind maybe I'll do yellow so I'm done
filming this is my outfit I decided that
I wanted to dress like a boy today I'm

just did not ever look at my ticket and
I don't know why swimmed it was today
but I've been like hyping it up for
today and literally was listening to
Harry Styles all day long did my makeup
was planning my outfit it's tomorrow so
you'll still see it it's just like a day
late because I'm an idiot but now I'm
laying in bed because I've been editing
videos for like two hours now when
editing makes me so tired it's a really
really bad because it should keep me
awake because I'm working but it makes
me so sleepy
this is how my nights going at 7:30 it's

this is what I'm doing I'm gonna use my
gel logical clear start blackhead

every morning anyway I feel like I want
to lay out today I really really really
want to tan but I don't know what time
I'm going to leave for the concert
that's actually today so I'm trying to
like plan out when I can tan and then
what time I need to get ready for the
concert because I don't want to be like
super like sweaty and gross before I go
so we'll see if I end up laying out

the morning guys like sing week in my
life videos this is it like it's
actually not that exciting I just lay
out and work and that's about it
okay so I took a shower I didn't wash my
hair my hair my hair is just so not okay
right now for some reason it's like
looking Gracie and I washed it like two
days ghosts I don't know if it's
something I put in it that like did not
sit well with it and made it more oily
than it normally is like a really dry
hair anyway that's not the point I for
some reason am a psychopath and I want
to get ready for the day so I'm going to
use my clear start Dermalogica break out
clearing booster again so I'm just gonna
apply this before my makeup but I'm
getting ready for the concert tonight
and it's what time 1 o'clock in the
afternoon I just like to be fully ready

want to get ready and like do my makeup
and all that kind of stuff I don't like
to like sit around and wait so I'm doing
makeup now and get ready so this is my
makeup it's all done super basic simple
makeup I put this video on or sweatshirt
on because I'm freezing but guys I'm
such such wifey material
I made ramen I've got some ramen for
lunch and I'm just gonna sit here and
eat my ramen and watch more Criminal

should really be doing instead of
sitting but this is like my break time
hey guys as you can see I'm home now
it's like midnight I'm about to take my
makeup off so I'm just gonna talk to you
guys while I do that I'm using this
tatcha cleansing oil and I do like that
one pump of it and then I rub it Oh

the highest section that you can get in
the whole stadium we didn't have four
tickets as basically what I was saying
and as we were walking to our section
there are two like security man like
guys who worked there and they were like
hey do you guys want to go on the floor
and we were like why and they're like
yeah you guys want these tickets and
they gave us tickets to the section that
you guys saw sitting in and I was just
so happy because that guy was so nice
and like what are the odds he just
walked up to us and gave us some really
nice tickets and we got to enjoy the
concert from a nice spot it was just
really really nice and I had a good
night I'm just pretty exhausted now

wasn't really feeling up to it so this
is what my morning looks like I'm
watching Gossip Girl and I'm coloring

it's like a stress relief for me it's a
coloring book of hair so I am just gonna
be coloring this and watching Gossip
Girl I'm going to church tonight at 7:30
it's just so sad that this is the last
day and the week in my life like it's
just so weird to not blog every day when

confused

knot style this is my stress relief
I got you
mom you're gonna be well that's not real
so I'm about to go do my makeup and get
ready to go to church but I wanted to
quickly give you guys a little like wrap
up discussion about these two products
that I've been testing out this week and
using because I really really really
wanted to see the results of them and I
feel like you guys can now see them I'm
gonna insert a clip here of what my skin
looks like in the beginning of this week
and what it looks like now as you can
see this stuff the Dermalogica clear
start break out clearing booster this
truly truly saved my skin this week I'm
not exaggerating as I showed you guys in
the beginning at this week my skin had
so many blemishes on this side of my
face and not even so many it's just that
they were super red and super irritated
and I could tell that if I left them
there without using any kind of
treatment they would have kept growing
and just gotten so much worse with this
using the breakout clearing booster once
I put it on you guys can clearly see the
redness is completely gone my skin tone
is even I don't feel like the acne bumps
anymore like as if they're growing
they're not on my skin and you guys can
see that they have gone down immensely
and that's just a week of using just
this product so imagine me using this
every morning and every night for
however long I know after using this for
this week that I can trust this product
and I know that it's gonna work
blackhead clearing mask I also really
love because I struggle with a lot of
blackheads again I showed you guys I
shrug with blackheads more in my
forehead area my chin sometimes my nose
not as much of my nose but more my chin
in my forehead and this you can actually
feel working on your skin you can feel
it fizzing up both of these products are
also only $21 which is amazing because
for the price of them and what they've
done to my skin and only just a week has
like shocked me and I'm so happy now
that I have them because any time I'm
sure I'm getting the freak out or I need
just a quick booster I know that I can
count on these products and that they're
actually reliable thank you so much to
