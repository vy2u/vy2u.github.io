just to start off this video I wanted to
say that this video is in no way of me
trying to tell you guys and like show
off my gifts or anything I just want to
show you guys my presents because I am
NOT doing any super favorites video
because basically everything in this is
gonna be my favorite so I just figured I
would show you guys is so it's kind of
making me super favorites and like what
I got for Christmas video but I'm gonna
start off first with clothes so the
first thing that I got is this scarf and
I'm actually obsessed a bit and feels
like she just feels so soft and I got it
from my dad and I've already worn it I
worried on Christmas Day so I absolutely
love this the next thing that I got is
from my boyfriend so I bought these nike
running leggings you can't really tell
or maybe you can in the light but it has
like stripes all the way down Lin and
then like a little library band on the
top and you got me those with this shirt
it just says nice on it's like a
long-sleeve like Nike une shirt also got
me at these shoes which I am obsessed
with so I basically I have black and
Nike shoes but they're really or down
and disgusting so I have these and I
ignore these are the everyday I already
will repent the next thing is from my
stepsister she got me this cardigan and
my mom has one like it and I literally
always take it so now I'm happy that I
have one of my own it's kind of just
black and gray mixture and then the
sleeve is leather so I love leather
and it's just the next thing is just a
t-shirt my mom got this for me but I am
obsessed with it because now I can wear
it like every day it's super oversized
and it's gray and then it just has my
initials on the little pocket so I can
get really cute and it's super soft now
on to the brandy melville clothing so
basically I just asked her a bunch of
sweaters so I got one tank top it's kind
of like a halter tank top looking thing
it's this and it's literally just a
black halter top but I really love it
because I can wear with a bunch of
different things like pretty accessories
with it and then I got this it's kind of
almost plumb when it's brownish and it's
just a really long cardigan and it's
super soft and again from brandy
melville next thing is a sweater which I
have been wanting this sweater for a
long time it's all my sweaters are
basically this tan color but the sleeves
have these are white stripes kind of
like a jersey looking kind of sweater I
don't know I love this so I'm obsessed
with this and it's oversized so I can
wear like jeans or leggings or whatever
and then this sweater is also huge and
oversized it is tan as well and it just
goes down to like my mid thigh and then
I have this one so and then the last one
I happened Randy bevel is the one I'm
wearing right now is actually a cropped
sweater and it's like black slash Navy
slash whatever now onto the items I got
for Christmas so the first thing I'm
going to show you guys is this which
this is a Polaroid printer so basically
you can connect to your phone and then
pick which pictures you want to print
out and it comes out and I'm gonna pull
it over in form I have a blurry bottom
get to choose what pictures I want to
print out so this is really
and I love this and my wall that Chef
forwards over it so I'm excited to use
it and fill it up with that and then she
got me feel the pour in the next thing

Marc Jacobs perfume so I have Stacy by
Marc Jacobs drop by Marc Jacobs Daisy by
Marc Jacobs the original one because
this one's this number one and then they
have honey by Marc Jacobs and they're

so tiny and I just want to save them I'm
obsessed with like anyway I'm obsessed
with small little things next thing is

just gold and has my initials and so
much sister got one too and has it in
