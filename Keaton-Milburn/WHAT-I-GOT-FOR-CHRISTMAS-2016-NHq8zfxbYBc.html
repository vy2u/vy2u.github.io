a Kylie cosmetics stocking and so I'm
going to show you guys a few things that
I got in here just because I don't know
I like stocking Oh first show you these

don't see if they really work obviously
they're really as good as everyone says
they are but I want to see if they

where I got my glasses and I did an
entire video on styling glasses and how
I style glasses I have like five
different pair of glasses and you guys
want to know where these are from and I
have four more pair of glasses that are
really really cute

either way so go check that out
ok so next if you guys have been
watching my videos for a while you have
know I get a planner every other
Christmas this is the planner I got this
year it is Erin Condren that is the
print again I will link err Condren down
below but it's just a really cute
planner has all my days and that kind of
stuff we get one every on Christmas
because it's a new year in January and
that is well it's just just when we get
one next I thought this was a cute idea
this is from mark and Graham I believe
and it is a little pouch like this you
can't really tell but has my initials on
it and it is for your headphones I just
keep my headphones in here and this is
really really good to travel with and
keep and it hers in my bag just like
anywhere though next if you guys saw a
picture on my Instagram I will again
insert a picture here of what my hair
looks like for me to get my hair like
that it literally took almost two hours
I had to do
can't do knocks if you guys know what
those are it's like basically I look
like Kodak black with my hair like
little balls all around my head and I
had to sleep in them and it was really
uncomfortable and I hurt um but I really
liked the curls that it gave me so I
sent my mom a curler and I was like this
would be perfect to curl my hair with
and I would get the same effect I just
would have to sleep in those curls
whatever does she want me a curler and
this is what it is oh you can't wanna
see but this is so tiny like it's
literally this big of a curler but I
really really like it I think my mom
found it on like Amazon or something
because I sent it to her and I was like
please give me this curler so I'm
excited to do my hair with this but next
I got a pair of Nikes this is what they
look like they are the air for our Chi
Nikes I believe yeah I don't know but
they're cloth which I really really like
is they're so comfortable and they're
maroon and I go to ASU so we're ruining
yellow it's gonna be really cute when I
wear like moon gear up with these so I
don't know I think they're different and
they're cute and okay so the last few
things I got are makeup so I got two
palettes the first one is one I'm asking
for forever I will show you guys what is
it everything a full spectrum palette
and this is what the outside looks like
the inside this is the inside it is just
like a rainbow of colors and I really
wanted this this probably is it everyone
like this isn't like a starter palette
you would like get to like start doing a
shadow but like I really wanted it
because I've been trying to do different
eyeshadows looks and all of my palettes
are just very simple colors which is
really good but they're just very very
simple and I never have like bright
colors if I wanted to like do something
I don't know really fun and I'm just
two great looks with these because this
is so cooling this one green like it's
so cool I love this the next pallet
everyone on their mom's is talking about
it is the peach to face palette sweet
peach palette and this obviously as
everyone says smells amazing like I
legit I'm digging it out right now I'm
gonna smell it it goes oh wait this is
the palette the colors are actually
really really pretty I did my eyes with
it today and I absolutely love it like I
am obsessed with this palette genuinely

these two palettes because I think it
would be really fun to student video
using these two palettes and that kind
of thing if you guys want to see I know
like a bottom looks with this but if you
guys you want to see a full spectrum
look or a peach look that would be
really really fun to read film so let me
