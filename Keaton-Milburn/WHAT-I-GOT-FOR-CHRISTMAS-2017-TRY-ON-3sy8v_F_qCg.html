the first thing I got from my aunt
it is a devotional it is the cute
Whisperer store name by sure hell I love

another devotional that I've read
multiple times before so it's always
good to have a new one which I love this
the next book is faith forward future by
Chad beech which is one of my favorite
pastors it's not my favorite pastor I
love him so I'm very excited to read
this book and I know it's gonna be great
so I'm probably I read this on the plane
all from Arizona but I don't know
exactly what it's about but thinking
it's about a faith forward future the
next book Hannah got me this is Turtles
all the way down by John Green you guys
know actually I hope you guys know this
because I don't think I talk about as
much but Fault in Our Stars is obviously
one of my favorite books I've read it
like 10 times I know everyone says that
but I will rent that book so many times
and I cannot even watch the movie
without crying so I'm very excited to
have a new john green book to read and i
just like having books what it look like
sitting in my room you're so cute
next thing is a planner I thought this
was so cute it has flowers all over it
but that gold has my name right there
and this is for the whole year of 2018
which I'm so so happy about I get one of
these every single year for Christmas I
get a new one so this one is by Erin
Condren that is the website that you
guys can find them on I'll link
everything down below in case you guys
want to go buy it with your Christmas
money your gift cards whatever I'll link
all the stuff I get in this down below
next up I got some candles so I got some
fountain fireworks one about the generic
marshmallow fireside one and I got this
one this one's still pretty it's marble
and it has a marble top and it smells
really good it's cinnamon spice vanilla
it smells amazing so I got those two and
then this is my favorite candle from
Bath and Body Works
it is the hey honey can I think I've
mentioned it in a favorites but oh my
gosh I'm like completely out of this one
back in Arizona so
I'm really happy that my mom got me this
because I really needed another one I
have such an obsessed with Kindle so
I've been asking for this candle for a
while they're like expensive candles I
don't know why this of them at
Nordstrom's but it is a bougie perfume
candle I'll be next up this is so random
but it's definitely me so this is like a
sino globe and it has accordion out flip
it that's like gold glitter and it has a
cork in it and I am obsessive corgis I
don't know a few I've ever mentioned
that before but I freaking love corny so
my mom got me this I don't even know
like I'm so happy about this I can't
wait to have my own then I got some
generic things I got some fuzzy socks
and this one my mom thought was funny
because for some reason it says snacks
on the side of itself I'm a snack and
now I have socks to say so as well and
then I absolutely love these headbands
they're just like these rapid ones this
wooden screen this one's blue I love
them I am obsessed with them so my
sister Hannah got me these and I'm so
happy I shall put this one on it kind of
goes with my outfit today but these are
so cool and then I got to beanies cuz I
told my mom I only had that black one
that I have and I really wanted some
more color so I got a white one and a
maroon one because you know I got a CO
this is like more purpley than room but
it's still cute and I just I really
needed some bb's next up this is a weird
accessory but Kourtney Kardashian said
she sleeps with a silk pillowcase so I
got a silk pillowcase it's just white
and you're supposed to like sleep on it
it's help you not it helps you not aid
helps you not wrinkle says anti sleep
crease anti bedhead and anti aging so
it's a difference in which kind of
pillowcase you use so silk pillowcases
are supposed to be like really good for
you when you sleep I don't know
next up I want to be so bad these are
some ups they are just ugh slippers
they're in brown I'm pretty sure I don't
know which I don't know which Co they
are but I really really wanted some
slippers so me and my sister and all of
us we got up slippers and I'm so excited
I'm just like hey really wanted these
next up for like the super a random item
so I got some Apple wireless headphones
these are like the Bluetooth one the air
pots for your phone I got these which
are super cool and then I actually
bought my little charging case with it I
think I look
my sake but I got a little charging case
with those and then this is like another
bougie accessory that's like not
necessary but it's Marvin's toothpaste
it is travel with flavor toothpastes
that are so cute they just look very
good like Instagram Robbie and I got
these because I also got a toothbrush so
I got this one what is this one cold I
don't know what the name of this is but
it is an electric toothbrush toothbrush
toothbrush and you travel with it and
it's just really pretty it looks like
it's like rose gold I am so excited my
brother got me this Justin Bieber
calendar it is so beautiful it just has
like a very beautiful picture of him
ever so I'm very type of this I'm going
to be putting up in my dorm and it's
going to remind me everyday that then I
got the usual I got some gift cards
Starbucks
AMC and now I also bought a really cool
I fly indoor skydiving gift card so my
dad's actually been endorsed guys before
and he really wants me to go so he got
me this little gift card so I think
we're gonna go at some point because I
need to go on home next thing you guys
will be very excited about I got a
really light so I got a green light here
this is going to be so helpful I wanted
a ring light and neither a ring light
for so freaking long and my dorm as you
guys know because you guys watch videos
when I do in there it's so dark I have
no lighting in there whatsoever like
right now I'm natural lighting but I
really needed a ring light for when it's
dark in my room and it's not light
enough to film so all you guys
complaining up and lighting and my
makeup tutorials it's going to be fixed
now I have a ring light so next up is
the clothes
so I'm actually trying these on for you
guys just because I figured that'd be
easier I don't like holding up clothes I
don't try I just think it doesn't help
you look at them whatsoever so I'm gonna
be trying these off you guys as well but
the first thing is this adidas jacket
it's a camouflage house white I saw this
at 6:02 the back actually has some words
on I don't even know what it says but I
thought this was so cute I love adidas
one for
I just think they're really cute with
like white leggings or something they're
just you to like go out in they look
trendy but not really to work out it to
tops I got from Urban Outfitters already
how this in maroon but I wanted it so
bad it's just this block button up and I
absolutely love it and then I also got
it in gray I love these they're so soft
if you guys haven't got them before I
haven't felt them before at Urban
Outfitters you need to they're so
essential and they're so easy to style
especially for like winter because it's
like if it's too hot or too cool it's
like the perfect top to wear so I love
that I got these I got some workout
clothes so my mom actually ordered the
top to go with these but it hasn't come
in yet so these are just nude leggings I
know they look kind of like Spanx but
they're not they're cute and noon I feel
like they're just kind of leggings not
necessarily to workout in which you
obviously can but I feel like they're
more cute to like style like dress up so
these are really cute they're from
Touche LA that's the brand my mom taught
me these leggings they're from the rent
active line they're great I have like
black and nude kind of on the little leg
and I just think they look so cute I
think they look adorable and then she
also got me the bra to go with it so it
matches it's black and then it also has
like the white issued on the bottom of
this and I really really needed like
workout leggings and a sports bra so I'm
so happy because I think this is you
workout clothes like I love going to the
gym looking cute I never like going
looking ratchet these next few things if
you guys have been watching me do vlog
unless you guys have probably seen them
but I did order these for myself before
Christmas but I feel like I should
include them in here because I'm not
doing a try on haul this winter and one
lady I went to try and haul but I didn't
order that much stuff so I just figured
I would show them here in my Christmas
haul so the first thing is this top it
is a bando all of these things are from
pretty little things so it's just like a
design little bando I thought this was
so cute it's more of like a satiny silk
material I just thought it was so pretty
so I ordered this and then I ordered a
very basic like olive green long-sleeve
I feel like this is really cute with
over the knee boots or like a bunch of
jewelry or a jean jacket over it and I
just feel like everyone needs an
oversized long sleeve
next is this yellow top house you could
chinese symbol on it it's a long sleeve
that has black on the arms going oh my
god I just thought this was so cute and
bright and really really different
I really just wanted to get this and
wear with like a leather skirt or
high-waisted black jeans something like
that this is just really really pretty
and you guys know y'all as my favorite
colors it was like I have to get this I
got this striped button-up blouse and it
comes with Chinese what doesn't come
with Hauser's but it's a snack so I got
this thought it would be so so pretty
it's like a night out or something like
that you guys will see as I'm trying it
on but the pants look amazing I need to
get them hemmed because they're too long
for me but they fit me perfectly and
they look so good with the top I'm not
one to wear like stripe on stripe sacks
that's just like not me but I feel like
this looked really really good
especially with my purple hair I wanted
it to be like a bunch of colors all
together so I love this that is for
printing as well and the last thing that
I got for Christmas that I'm so excited
about is I got Harry saucy it's from my
dad and his girlfriend which I'm so so
happy about so I'm gonna be seeing Harry
