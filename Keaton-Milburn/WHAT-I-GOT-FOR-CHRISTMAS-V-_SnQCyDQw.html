basically like one giant haul so I'm
just going to show you guys everything I

into it so the first thing I'm gonna
talk to you guys about is obviously
what's in my head so I got extensions
for Christmas so they are girls you guys
can see they're like way longer than my
natural hair my natural hair stops about
whoa that's not even my natural hair but
natural hair stops like right here but
my extensions go like way past that and
I really really love them they're from
Bellamy and they are the belly osh hair
whatever bye I don't even know his name
I got the box cuz they're in my head and
I just have up the box with me this is
like basically what they look like they
seriously go perfectly with my hair I'm
obsessed with them already that's the
first day I've worn them and I just
really really love them so yeah the next
things I'm just gonna go off like what I
already have my body the next item is
from Hallie and I got this little like
pajama outfit it probably is look like
pajamas on camera but I'm wearing this
little cropped sweatshirt and then Oh
guys I'm just gonna and it comes with
these little shorts and they're so cute
and they're just pajamas but you can
kind of like wear it as I know you know
like
you want to wear it as so I've been in
this all day and it's the comfiest thing
they're from Urban Outfitters and then
the other things I got so I got these
necklaces it's not multiple necklaces
it's like three one it's like gold one
is rose gold and one is silver and
they're like it's not even a coin it's
just a circle kinda looks like it would
be a coin from far away but these are
from Urban Outfitters and Hallie also
got me this necklace and this is just
like a three layer I love you guys are
gonna see like a little shrine tear but
I love three like layered necklaces and
so then I got this one from Hallie and
the night also this is kind of tangled
but I got this one for my dad and it's
like three different kind but they're
really small and dainty oh my god it's
pouring raining outside so if it's
really loud I'm sorry
so that is that okay so now I'm gonna
show you guys all like the clothing
items I got so then I got this shirt
this is from Urban Outfitters it is just
a black a v-neck and as weird as this
sounds I don't own a single black v-neck
like not a single Bobby neck so I'm
actually really excited about this
because it's so basic and a very basic
person I just want grays and blacks and
stuff like that so I have this from
Urban Outfitters then I have this jacket
this is just a Nike jacket like a
workout jacket and I just asked for like
workout clothes for Christmas just
because I wear them more not that I
actually work out but that I like like
to just hang out in a workout clothes
they're just comfortable you guys know
you feel me so I got this damn this is
from Hallie she got me this top you guys
made so us and my vlogmas I showed some
of this stuff but she got me this and it
looks kind of weird on camera but it's
like a light blue purple it's basically
like periwinkle kind of so I got this
cuz she knew I liked it cuz she got it
for me and white and so I really really
loved this then I got two pair of
leggings from Lululemon
so the first pair is like the most
comfortable pair of leggings ever it's
just like this like mesh grey they're
really really thick and very comfortable
and I've worn them for like two
straight just because you know Vikings
and then I got this other pair of
leggings from the lemon these are the
most beautiful things they're blue and
they have this little line on them and
the material is not as thick as that
it's like a thin and like I don't even
know it has a little zipper on the back
these are so cute I love them and then
to go with that she also I say she liked
my mom but she also got me this Lulu
Lemon like zip up jacket because I
always steal all her zip up jackets and
it just goes really really well with
both of the leggings moving on my
separate I got me this little LSU go
Tigers like t-shirt just because you
know he goes to LSU you like LSU I was
born in Louisiana so this is really cute
and I never have any like nice LSU
shirts ever like seriously ever odd but
I don't then I got these two like bra
let's which you guys have seen these
everywhere so wow this is inside out I
know this white wine I got this one in a
grey color and actually bought this for
Hallie and I was like this is the
prettiest color and then I got it for
Christmas so I'm really excited about
that next I actually bought this for
myself when I was shopping when I was
Christmas shopping because like duh I
just like I don't know you can't look
like not by yourself like one thing I'm
stupid I know but it's just like a
t-shirt from Urban Outfitters it's from
the men's section and I don't know why I
wanted it but it was five dollars and so
I got it from the men's section of Urban
Outfitters and just a little more second
one it is comfortable okay moving on to
like the other like little stuff so I
got this planner you guys are always
asking where I get my planners I get
them from Erin Condren calm and this one
just this the window was making it look
weird but it's like coral color it has
like my initials K in one here and then
it's just like a really really nice
planner their planners are my favorite I
will link this one down below if you
guys want to get one but we get them
like for Christmas every year because
like the planner expires like every year
in December so we get a new one like
epic on different designs
I really love this bless me Carson so
the next thing you guys are probably
seen everywhere maybe you guys got some
for Christmas not really sure but I got
so many coloring books I say so many I
really only got three but that's a lot
of coloring to do so the first one I got
is it's like traditional henna body art
and it just has like a bunch of like
drawings that kind of look like Hannah
which I really really like you can't see
a little camera but I started coloring
one I started coloring this one so it's
coming out pretty cute and then my mom
want me like colored pencils so I can
color on them and then I also have this
one this one is probably my favorite
coloring book this one is love my hair
and it's literally just like people's
hair you can't even see it on camera but
it's like a braids and curls I don't
know it just has like hair to color
sounds weird but I like this one and
then this one is really really hard I'm
gonna put this like up to the campers
you guys can see I'll just open like any
other book this is literally what you
have to color like this would be the
hardest thing to color but this one is
fantastic cities and it's just another
coloring book I'm pretty sure all of
them they sell at Urban Outfitters so if
you guys want one of them you know get
them at Urban another thing that I
bought for myself is this cleaner it's
ACTRA cleaner I don't really know I saw
this at lady Foot Locker basically it's
like a foam and you would spray it on
your shoes like any of your Nikes and
you just like let it soak it and then
you rub it off and it cleans it so well
I have some shoes that are so disgusting
and I use this on them they're not fully
clean yet because they're so gross but I
can tell this worked really really well
and she did like a lot of sample in the
store which is why I bought it and so I
really love this and I bought this for
myself so it's kind of what what I got
for Christmas to like my makeup
so these are so excited about how I
don't be so much stuff everything you
need it's all like for now anyway so um
you guys probably saw these also if you
watched my blog but I got two lip liners
and MAC lipsticks lol from Mac I got
this one in in control just like a
darker red and then this one is like not
a darker red it's like dark like pink
and then I got this one in sore which is
like a light it's not a nude pink but
it's like more like a muted out pink and
then this is the lipstick in twink and
this one is so pretty I've been wanting
this for so long I'm so happy I have it
you guys are probably gonna see this
like upcoming tutorial or something like
that but it's like oh it's so beautiful
two other things from Mac that my mom
actually got me are the Mac pigments and
I always look at these every time I'm
checking out their like in the little
thing in the front and I'm always like I
should buy one but I never like know if
I really want one and I'm so happy I got
them this was saying blue Brown so this
one's like a really pretty shade and
this one is like a really pretty pink
almost like rose gold it's yeah the name
of its rose so this one's really really
pretty
and I can't wait to use these like you
can use them like you can use these for
a lot of different things but I just
really really like these for like
eyeshadow like pink maybe stuff like
next this is what I have on my lips
today and you guys have been asking me
what my lip color has been and like my
blogs you guys are all commenting that
and this is pure Hollywood by anastacio
so this is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick and it is the prettiest
shade the first one I bought it at when
I bought it I bought it for Holly but I
got those for Christmas but first when I
got it I like did it know if it was
gonna be too light but it actually turns
out really really good because my other
like like pink nude shades are not as
like light as this and I needed one and
then I got two mascaras which I'm
excited for this one because this one is
perversion by urban decay and everyone
talks about this one so I'm really
excited to try it out and then this one
is the roller lash which I already have
and it's really really good so the last
two things are shoes so the first pair
is these just white converse you guys
like you don't really want comers yes I
do but they're disgusting and I really
really need a new ones
I haven't had white converse for like
months because the ones I have are just
they're literally yellow they're so bad
so I got some new ones last but not
least what you guys probably have been
wanting to see are these beautiful Nikes
I'm about to show you so these are the I
think Air Max yeah they're that Air Max
Thea Nikes and you guys can you tell a
beautiful they are on screen but they
are new tan Nikes I wanted these so bad
and like I was like oh I'm just gone
like the nike website and like buying
them for myself
yeah they don't sell them on Nike my mom
like literally bought these from someone
off eBay for like a not really amazing
price considering that the actual style
of these shoes are like 150 or something
125 or something like that but these
were like really expensive apparently
because kylie jenner more than which I
did not know and I wanted them I saw
these on Twitter and you guys if you
follow me on Twitter I tweeted them to
my mom I wanted them so bad I really
didn't think I would get them so these
are the Nikes and I have yet to wear
them because they're so beautiful I
don't want to wear them in crappy
weather and already messed them up so
that is that okay so I totally like stop
the video because I was like oh I showed
everything I forgot I have a bag of like
a few things next thing I got is this
watch and this is a Marc Jacobs watch
it's just like all black and face of it
is all black but like the around it is
rose gold and I've worn this for like
the past four days
so has it been four days since I alone
then this I think is the most beautiful
thing this is a Starbucks mug and this
is the rating sort this is a matte black
Starbucks mug I love this and it just
has like little lids I can like take it
everywhere I drink coffee every single
morning so what are you to me anyway I
drink coffee every single morning so
this is gonna be really good to take to
school with me okay the last two things
the rail lost two things I got are a
keychain so the first one is from
Michael Kors and you guys have probably
seen this before
it's the little puffball and it's so
cute it's like a bluegray and it's
really soft and I can't wait to put this
on like you they're my keys or my purse
or something like that
and then I also got this and this is
from Louboutin and it is like a little
wallet I'll open it up I kept in the
package because it's beautiful but it's
basically it's just like a little tiny
lots I can put my change my ID like the
basics of like what I needed I don't
want to carry around like a full on
wallet and I have this like on my keys
or something this is really good to just
what that's a lighter what are you doing
Carson you can't do that anyway guys
