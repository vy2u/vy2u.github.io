I'm even in focus for this video and
I've been trying to film it for so long
I filmed it once already and I've tried
to do it a second time and then I
thought I was out of focus so I stopped
it and then I changed shirts and it just
has been a dilemma today so I'm going to
film this video super quick for you guys
obviously this is a what I packed from a
mission trip I am going on a mission
trip tomorrow so by the time you watch
this video I'm already in Dominican
Republic
I'm going on a mission trip and then I'm
going to say I'm going to be blogging
about 50 you guys are going to see the
whole mission trip basically I'm going
to be vlogging every single day but I
didn't want to show you guys what I
caught in my bag just in case some of
you guys are going on a mission trip or
want to go on a mission trip this may
help you all the stuff that I packed
depends on where you're going so a lot
of you guys might be going somewhere
where you're in a cold your climate or
hotter climate it all depends but this
is just specific to Dominican Republic
where I'm going so I just figured I
would show you guys give you some tips
and yeah I'm very very comfy in this
video I am leaving very early in the
morning so I wasn't all dressed and put
makeup on and stuff so sorry about that
for this trip I'm only packing in a
carry-on bag so I'm not going to be
checking a bag so everything has to fit
in a carry-on bag so oh my gosh this is
my carry-on bag it's giant but it is
from see wonder if I find the bag then I
won't leave it down below here guys so
let's just see what I have in here first
of all I'm not going to be taking out
any of my clothes because I already
packed it all and what I pack is not
necessarily what you guys are going to
pack so this is all up to you but
basically like a bunch of leggings a
bunch of shorts t-shirts super light
stuff because I'm going to be out in the
heat all day long and so I want to wear
super light clothing for most of the
time that I'm there I'm going to be
wearing light clothing some of the
nights if we have church one days I'm
gonna be wearing a nice long skirt with
stuff like that so that is all the
clothing that I packed now I'm not going
to show you all of it specifically
because that just depends on you but I
will show you my toiletries and all this
other stuff so first thing I have is
this loofah and this I bought at Target
and I wanted a new one first of all
that's why I bought it and then I was
like you know I can take this with me to
the Dominican so I bought this it's just
a little white loofah smells lovely um
and then I have this one-piece bathing
suit because as for most mission trips
if you're going to be swimming which I
am there's a beach in the Dominican
Republic it's so pretty there so I have
this one-piece bathing suit and this is
from Victoria's Secret and I'm obsessed
with it first of all it looks kind of
weird I guess but it's super super cute
on and I just really really liked this
so I packed this kind of high-waisted oh
let's turn that off the next thing that
I needed for Dominican Republic was um
water shoes and I did not want to buy
the little sneaker water shoes because I
literally not cute at all to me my
opinion I don't like them so I bought
these little sandal ones from Target and
they're so cheap they kind of look like
a little I forgot what they're called
but they're just subtle sandal ones I
hope you can tell and they just wrap
around the foot and around the back man
cool and I figured I can just wear these
because they said that there's a lot of
like spiky rocks and sea urchins and
stuff in the water and that we're going
to need water shoes so we had to buy
these and these were super cheap I think
they were like $12 at a Target so yeah
love these well I don't love this I love
this occasion next is this bag and this
is most of my toiletries makeup and all
that kind of stuff that I packed in here
and I'm going to be showing you guys all
over this I don't know where this bag is
from I got it as a gift or like
something like that so I can really tell
you that but let's just get into this so
we have shirts that were wearing
specifically like every single day that
they're going to get to us to make it on
the mission trip so for that we're going
to need to be washing the shirts because
we're going to have to like alternate
them so I brought a unscented bar of
Dove soap and I just put it in this
little packaging from Target everything
basically is from Target um I bought
this and so I can wash my shirts in the
sink with that because we're gonna have
like a washer dryer there then moving on
to face wash I have this is the st. Ives
apricot scrub and then I haven't
in your wares yeah I have the same Ives
blackhead cleansing green tea scrub so I
both scrubs I want to try both of them
and they're just in the mini travel size
because I can only bring three ounces
with me
so I have these and then I just
absolutely love them and they smell so
good I know I'm like smelling the casing
but I use done before so I know these my
face moles
oh good next I have the dub go fresh
nutrient or sure this is just another
travel size all of this trouble sized
stuff I got at Target they have like one
giant section for it target is like my
go-to I love it so much and so I have
that um that's for this whoa for some
song sure so I bought this scrub and
this is just for when I shower next I
have this Garnier Fructis shampoo and
I'm going to be using this for when I
shower also again travel size and then
deodorant regular size because it's
three ounces and this is just for when
I'm out and about I don't want to smell
so now on to makeup I didn't bring a lot
of makeup because it really will
probably not be wearing makeup at all
but if I want to wear makeup one day I
don't want to not have it with me so I
just packed a little bit I actually just
bought this and this is the covergirl BB
cream it is the broad spectrum SPF 21 so
this is just a tinted moisturizer and as
whoa-ohh
I don't think you understand I do that
in every video I always drop something
like why am I always dropping something
in my hand I can't hold anything so this
is that I got it in the shade light to
medium because my skin is pretty cool
right now it would have got a darker
shade but I pale right now so I have
this and this is just super light
coverage checking nothing
like super crazy this is just in case I
want to wear makeup so I brought this
and to apply it I brought this Tarte
foundation brush super small compact
little things then I brought this blush
and I also brought a ball I also brought
a bronzer so this is the corlisses
benefit blush and this is the Tarte
Amazonian clay bronzer at Park F
Princess have this for a while which is
why it's so small because I originally
bought travel size I think
definitely hit parent in this but I love
this my favorite bronzer so I brought
these too and with that I only brought a
contour brush and a blush brush because
those are all me to apply that with then
I brought the Laura Mercier pressed
powder in the shade 6 and this is just a
little pressed powder I've used this for
a long time and also hit pan on it this
is just to go over anything if I want to
add more and then this brush I really
don't know but it's just like a little
powder brush that I can bring with me
next I have my Maybelline age rewind
concealer for like dark circles or
whatever so I just put this underneath
my eye I don't actually have dark
circles but I like this one more than
the other concealers so I always get
this one and this is just in the shade
210 it's fair clear so next I have my
Maybelline Alliance stiletto eyeliner
this is just in case I need it probably
won't be wearing eyeliner that much but
just in case I was like having it with
me but I don't know in case my eyes were
feeling like naked or something and got
on them and then I have my covergirl
LashBlast volume waterproof mascara and
this is awesome it's one of my new
favorite mascaras like all this and my
stocking and I was like this is weird I
don't know I'll try it love this I love
this mascara so I bring it with me also
it's waterproof so when I'm swimming
it was definitely be perfect better than
my
benefit mascara then I have this this is
the speed brow by benefit this is just
keep eyebrows in place I won't be
filling a min or anything I don't think
I really need to do that while in there
so I just have this and then I also have
the revlon colorburst bomb scene this is
just like a little bomb say it's super
like alright even though it's a minty
and it like feels like it's refreshing
my lips and I love it so I brought this
with being a so I want a little color
cuz I'm not bringing any lipsticks or
lip liner or anything like that
and then I have eyes shadow primer so
this is what I will put on my eyeshadow
to prime it I cannot put eyeshadow on
without a primer I feel like the
weirdest person ever if I don't use the
primer so I have this and I love it so
much the light is changing outside it's
really bother me so sorry the lighting
is so weird in here with that the only
eyeshadow palette that I'm bringing is
the Naked 2 basics and this is just all
I need I won't need anything crazy well
in their specific basic colors in case I
want to do my eyeshadow I honestly
probably will be wearing this much
makeup I know it seems like a lot but I
won't probably be wearing any of it this
is just in case for church or if I need
to look a little bit nicer next I'm
bringing these three little makeup
brushes eyeshadow brushes I've got a ham
boom for like two seconds this is just
for all over the lid this is for in my
crease and then this is just to blend
out these I'll bring just in case again
I want do my eyeshadow and then the last
thing that I have in this bag is the
Huggies makeup wipes you guys know I use
these and Gary's actual makeup wipes I
always use Huggies like wipes to wipe my
face off and then also I might just need
them just in case I think's gonna gross
and I want to wipe my face these just
like you so much coming out loved them
so much so I've had me so that is what
it's going to be in my carry-on bag now
I'm going to move on to my personal bag
you get one carry-on and what personal
so this is going to be my personal bag I
will show you guys it is this big oh my
gosh it is the Lululemon backpack I will
try and find it and Link it again down
below for you guys but I'm going to be
carrying this all over with me when I'm
on admission
so I just figured I'd use this as my
personal bag and put everything 19 in it
so the first tip I will show you guys is
where my computer is it's just a little
back zipper in the back of the bag it's
right here super heavy sigh here
elliptical show you guys but that's gosh
is my computer okay so now inside the
big part of my bag so this is she's like
the big section part of it now what I'm
going to show you guys you probably need
for like any mission trip so if this is
just sunscreen it's been eight about
sport and this is bug spray you'll
probably need these for any mission
reports can be hot and gross and you'll
definitely need sunscreen and definitely
a bug spray and then because my
conditioner couldn't fit in my
toiletries bag I put it in my carry-on
so this is just the fruit east
conditioner with that I had to pack in
here I also have a travel toothbrush I
have an electric toothbrush but I'll
bring it with me I bring this little one
and then I also have my passport in here
my picture is so what is that my picture
is so ugly guys like oh my gosh it's the
worst thing I've ever seen
I'm nachos and then I can not get on a
plane without Gus I brought a five pack
of gum because I needed to go where my
ears will pop and I'm really freaked out
so I always bring them with me while
we're there we're going to be having a
lot of different foods that we don't
know might get hungry we want to snack
so I brought a bunch of snacks I should
have this stuff it's just like Oreo sort
of like cookie quiz
um this is little mini muffins for
breakfast you think I don't eat their
breakfast and then this is just like
granola bars stuff like that that I
might want to snack on throughout the
day am i packing my bag and then also
for like the kids that were going to be
with on the fishing trip I wanted to
like pass out candy and everything so me
and Hannah I'm going to my sister Hannah
and we got these bags of candy I just
don't work at school but she has another
half of first candy it has airheads
lollipops and Smarties all in this max
range pass these out over there so that
is going into my backpack which then for
my snack on the plane I bought these
imminency are the birthday cake the arsy
do that even makes sense
these are the birthday cake flavor these
are so good I'm obsessed with it and
literally tastes just like birthday cake
chocolate cake with chocolate cake in a
bag so good don't try not to eat them
all before next I brought this little
body mist it's called the body mist I
don't know where it's from I think I got
in my stocking but it smells so good and
I was like I need this like I need this
just in case
I like sink or I wanted to spray a
little bit on before dinner or something
like that and then I also brought a mini
aloe vera in case I get sunburned while
in there I don't think I will get that
somewhere but just in case and then I
also have a thing of toothpaste for my
teeth with and this is just the 3d crest
again all the aloe vera and this is all
from Target because they have a bunch of
travel stuff I suggest you go to Target
for that because it has so many travel
options and so many things you can get
in travel size I didn't know you could
and I loved it so the next thing is the
smokey charger this you can get it like
the Apple Store or anything like that
this I definitely suggest because you're
going to be out and about also while I'm
missing one nail that's
but this I suggest because you're gonna
be out and about and you're not gonna be
at the hotel you're gonna be out doing
something all day and then you're going
to go home at night and so I wanted to
bring a charger with me cuz my phone
guys I want to be able to take pictures
and stuff like that
and then I also brought with me my
harddrive and this is just in case my
computer runs out of storage so I
brought a hard drive with me so I can
make all of that on there obviously
that's optional next moving on to the
front zippers right up here so in the
front one it looks kind of like a little
camera case or I need a glasses case
I brought my glasses because I might be
a changing the contacts on there so at
my Warby Parker goss's in my lobby
Parker case and then I also brought a
headband this is from Orem this
remebered Outfitters and it's just a
little have been like this just in case
I want to wear one of the games and I
like might look cute I don't really know
just in case
next I'm bringing in my little front
zipper these are all in the front
pockets of my backpack I have this and
this is just the Mophie charger to
charge the mochi with and these are
rubber bands yes you never know I always
lose ever bands I'm like the worst at
that so I bought a bunch because I'll
probably lose it I'll probably bring
like 25 and then come home with my new
one
next I have headphones this is for the
plane obviously put this in his backpack
because I wanna be able to reach it so
just regular little I Bowl Apple what do
I you can see like that just break your
little apple headphones then I have
bobby pins just in case you never know
when you're gonna need them definitely
can't see a sizer this is a must this is
also from Target and it's so cute in a
little and I brought this because I
don't know I'm gonna want to wash my
hands I like kind of stuff but if we're
out where I can't go to the restroom I
want to have
hand sanitizer and then you guys are
gonna be so excited about this but I am
bringing my GoPro so I'm gonna be
vlogging the entire trip already said
that but I'm just really really excited
about it and I bring my GoPro and the
waterproof case taking turns like swim
and film I do all this other cool stuff
for you guys so I'm gonna try and get as
much of it on video as I can but I also
want to like be present for the trip I
want to not like worry about like all
that other kind of stuff so if I don't
walk some of it I'm sorry but I am
experiencing what I want to experience
and I will try and vlog most of it for
you guys and then I can't remember party
showed you guys whoa I can't remember to
show you guys this but there's a little
water bottle on the side that I also got
from Target it's just a little water
bottle that I'll be filling up when I
get there and yeah so that is basically
it that is everything that is in my
mission trip bags obviously you didn't
go into detail with the clothing but
that's self-explanatory for whatever
trip you're going on I hope some of
these items gave you a good idea of what
to pack it might not even be for a
mission trip it might be just for like a
long time trip and you have to pack in a
carry-on and you need to like fit
everything in one and this is just
little things that you can bring and
things that might help you or remind you
what to bring so hope you guys like this
video I want to do it super quick
because I'm gonna be posting a ton of
vlogs and I don't want you guys to just
be watching like 25 vlogs and go regular
