to be everything that they don't tell
you doing sway recruitment as you guys
can see by the title I haven't wanted to
make this video for a long time but this
video has also been so highly requested
because I guess a lot of you guys are
filming into story of recruitment
whether you guys are incoming freshmen
and call Nate or guys are going to be a
sophomore college it doesn't matter a
lot of you guys haven't asked me to do a
video all about my experience during
recruitment and what it was like for me
personally so I just figured I was hi
guys things that I wish that I knew when
I was going through story recruitment
and things that they just don't tell you
when you're going through so I figured
this video would be really really
helpful even if you're not going into
college this is a good perspective if
you guys are about to graduate and you
guys don't really know if you want to go
through recruitment and if a lot of you
guys don't know what Kerman is basically
when you are joining a sorority in
college you have to go through like rush
week which is basically like they
recruit you and you basically go through
this really long process of finding
which sororities best fits you so if you
guys are really really skeptical about
it I hope that I can change your mind
today with this video so yeah let's just
get right into it so the first thing I
didn't know when I was going into
recruitment was that recruitment and
rush is very very hard so I didn't know
this I just thought it was like oh I'll
just like go like a dress and I tell her
like talk to people but it is literally
so so exhausting to go and meet all of
these different sororities and just talk
all day long a lot of times you're
talking about the same thing you're just
getting asked the same exact questions
and you're just smiling while talking
and it's just like really really hard
and I was not prepared for that
whatsoever like I did not know that rush
week and recruitment was that hard the
second thing that I did not know till I
got into a sorority with that these
people these sororities that are
recruiting you have been waiting all
year and working all year towards
getting new members into their chapter
like you understand like now I fully
fully appreciate
like everything that goes into crewmen
when I was going there I was like oh
yeah like this is cute whatever but it
is so much work and I have no idea that
people in sorties like they have been
waiting all year just for one member to
come into their chapter and just like
get new people and I had no idea like
how exciting this was for them like I of
course thought it was like cool from you
to like want to be in a sorority but I
have no idea how exciting it is for the
actual chapter to be getting all these
new members the third thing that they
don't say is what to wear so I actually
did go to an orientation before I went
into recruitment and like they kind of
tell you like don't worry things that
show too much skin or don't worry things
that are like stuff like that but like I
had no idea what to wear like I
literally was texting everyone I know
and all that so what did you buy for
this and what'd you get for that like I
had no idea I don't they don't really
tell you like okay the first day wear
rompers second day wears it's like they
don't really say specifics they just say
in general and its really really hard if
you're like me and I have to plan my
outfits for events like two months
before I go to them so like going to
recruitment I was like I am so stressed
I don't know what to wear so I'm going
to get into like more details on like
that I want to give you guys tips but
that is like something I didn't know and
what they don't tell you going into
recruitment before things they don't
tell you what going into treatment is
what to talk about so I literally didn't
realize like oh my gosh I need to have
talking points like literally until I
was like about to go into my first
chapter like I was like wow I didn't
even think about this but like I should
have something to say to these people
and I have nothing to say like it's
literally like an interview and like I
was so unprepared and like I didn't know
that there were certain things they just
like shouldn't talk about in recruitment
and there are certain things that you
should so yeah that was like a big thing
for me and like no one told me like yeah
you should ask some questions about this
like I had no clue going into it so the
last thing that they don't tell you when
going through crewman is what to bring
no one tells you like yeah this is going
to be a full day like of literally he's
deaf
not really but it's just like I had no
idea like I just don't like show up and
like talk to a few people then leave no
that is not that it's not what
recruitment is and it's not how it goes
especially guys live like this south
like southern stories are so so so
intense I go to Arizona State which it's
not as intense as like Alabama or and
Amer things like that like yeah it was
just like I didn't know like what to
bring what to even think so now I'm
going to tell you guys what you need to
know this is what I wish I was known
when I was going into recruitment so
like let's just get started what you
need to know is that everyone always ask
what do you wear for recruitment so the
first day is when you're a meeting a
chapter the second day I think it's like
scizor a day and then you have from
olanzapine area philanthropy and then
you have sisterhood and then you have
press day which is like for you this day
where you have two sororities and you
have to take which one and then the last
day is the day that's where you get your
sorority so I don't really know what to
wear for any of the days you do get told
on like a big day what you should wear
to that sorority so I was told to
basically dress progressively nicer so
throughout each day I dress thanks to
like the first day I wore like a floral
Robert also got it like insert pictures
here of each day what I wore because I
basically wore floral every single day
so first day I'm pretty sure when I got
off shorter floral dress and then I wore
another nice dress from Urban Outfitters
like just some dresses and basically
what I'm more like the first three days
I believe none of the days that I wear
Commerce or Dida's or flasks or sandals
every single day I wore heels and
doesn't have to be like six and shields
but like little sandal heels that peel
like that bag that like the one that I'd
wrap up you know what I'm talking about
those are really really cute for
recruitment I run like spills I also
like wear accessories I'm like I wore
what I felt make me need and dye is
something that's really really important
going through recruitment don't dress
how do you think as to Rory wants you to
dress dress how you dress if you don't
wear floral don't wear floral wear
something else right
solid romper like this or something like
where what do you want to wear
so keep it light kind of nice because
it's like you're meeting someone it's
almost like an interview but like don't
try and fit into a sorority
where were you already would wear
because that's like the most important
thing also for makeup a lot of people
were like oh you have to kick your face
miss and you want to go with a full beat
face every single day do it I went with
like literally a full face of makeup
every single day all the people were
like oh you don't want to wear that much
they don't like makeup it doesn't matter
if you like wearing makeup and grant
pick up if you don't like wearing
mangoes don't wear makeup it doesn't
matter it just generally depends on you
but I would say that each day I
definitely got like progressively nicer
so on the last day which is prep day or
it's just like where you go to two
stories and you pick which one you want
I wore like a two-piece set I'll put a
picture right here it was really really
pretty and I work with heels and it
looked a lot more dressier than the rest
of my other outfits for recruitment and
then big day is basically when you like
go to your sorority so normally they
will when you go to your story they'll
give you a t-shirt to wear the day of
recruitment or like the day of big day
and you also put that over whatever
you're wearing so I wore jean shorts and
a white tank top and commerce and then I
went to my house and again your t-shirt
and I put on over and then I rolled with
matching you just really jean shorts
whatever but also depends I don't know
depending on your school the same will
tell you what you guys should wear the
second thing that I feel is super
important during recruitment is that
there are a lot of rumors during
recruitment and I didn't realize that
like everyone I saw that no one knew
anything about any sororities but that
is not the case like I have so many
people when I was like in lines go into
a certain house they're like oh my gosh
you hear the stories in this lunch or
you hear their trouble for this and
literally 99% of the rumors I have heard
during recruitment were not true like
half of them were so false and just
people would make things up about
sororities that like they didn't like or
say like someone didn't get chose back
to come to a health but they would be
like oh will they do this and like it
would change your perspective on what
you think of a sorority that you might
actually like so I personally say do not
listen to what anyone else has to say
house if you like the house like you
like the house it doesn't matter if
someone's like oh they're terrible they
said it's like brewers are 100% not true
look until you get into the story you'll
never know how it is there are so many
amazing people in each and every
sorority and like the reason why you may
like a sorority are completely different
than why someone else might not like a
sorority so don't let people's rumors
and everything people are saying about a
certain house upsets how you like it
like I always hated like being outside
of houses like oh my gosh based on this
and like in my head oh it sounds like
the top sorority that I like and it
would just be so disappointing to hear
people say things because then your life
will do I even want to be a part of that
house if everyone this is just really
confuses you so if you're going through
a recruitment if people are saying
things on certain houses please try your
very very best to not listen to any of
the rumors because a lot of the words
are not true and it just it just sucks
it just sucks people start rumors and
talk grout the third thing that you guys
need to know going through recruitment
is that people kut'rs like the people
talking to you are just as nervous and
if not even more nervous like I was so
nervous going into each house because I
oh my gosh I don't know today I'm so
uncomfortable but like you don't
understand how nervous recruiters really
really are because they want you guys to
be in their house so badly and they want
you guys to love what they do like they
love their chapter and they love
everything that they stand for and they
want you guys to love it too and you
don't understand how nervous it is to
just go up to someone you've never been
met and just have a conversation within
like it is so so hard for me what I wish
I kind of would have done which I feel
like I did this kind of but what I wish
I would have done is like don't leave
the conversation just up to the
recruiter like if someone is talking to
you and they're like oh what's your name
years like Keaton or favorite color
yellow like that is so boring like I
feel like sometimes I feel like
sometimes people go into a house and
they just expect that person to carry on
the entire conversation and that's not
how it is you guys need to know how to
carry a conversation - it's like a
two-way street I think that like when
you're going to accrue mind you should
be engaged in conversation and asking
them questions about their lives and
you know questions out there chapter
like what is your philosophy stand for
what do you do like things like that I
just feel like maybe I should have some
questions for period I didn't have any
questions prepared and like after like
the third day like I was like you know
what I need to sort asking things about
this and so I feel like that's super
important to know that they are just as
nervous of you if not more nervous and
it's super important for you guys both
to carry on the conversation I don't
think it's just up to them the sort of
thing I wish I'd known I thought you
should definitely bring water and snacks
the first day was such a long long day
for me and I was starving and I was
thirsty and there were girls who
legitimately pass out during recruitment
like they are walking around all day
going to all these different houses and
it's hot outside and then they pass out
because they don't bring water they
don't think food they don't eat all day
and they don't do all this stuff don't
be that girl do not be that girl who
passes out or get sick during
recruitment you guys should be drinking
water bring food and bring snacks bring
little bag like bring something like
bars something like that because
seriously I remember the first day like
all no like I cannot do this again I
will be bringing food back with me I'll
bring a water bottle back with me like I
remember bring a charger please bring a
charger because your phone will die and
then you'll be really really sad also
another thing that I brought was a
notebook and every single day of
recruitment I would write down what
house and then what I remember about
that house it like at night when I was
like going back thinking about the
chapter I'm good
oh yeah they were wearing this polar
t-shirt and the room was decorated like
this and I talked to a girl named
Kennedy and she said this like thinking
like that you should write down and you
should try and remember because there
are so many chapters and it gets so hard
to not mix them all up so definitely
bring a notebook and pencil with you as
well the next tip I have you guys what
you guys definitely need to know is to
not get overwhelmed
get excited and that is like the number
one saying is I am NOT like a clappy
kind of girl I'm not about the chance I
was never on the cheer team like I just
not about that life so but I walked into
my first house and everyone like
clapping and like singing like I was
like no thank you like I remember
calling my mom the first day of
recruitment I was like I just don't
think I want to go through it anymore
like it's just weird everyone's yelling
at me it just is a bunch of
girls are just like being weird like I
remember I was like I don't like it I
like it all in I was like you know what
you need to stick with it like you just
go and I went through the rest of
equipment and I could not be happier if
you went into a chapter and they were
all just standing there looking at you
not clapping not cheering like you would
be like do they even care that I'm here
but if you walk into a chapter they're
all clapping all excited they're all
happy they look like they genuinely want
you they're like that is something to be
excited about not nervous about the last
thing that I want to reiterate that you
guys need to know is choose what you
want everyone has an opinion about what
story it could be and your mom might
have been in a sorority that like she's
like you need to be in this one go with
this one you're going to be a lot of
people if if you don't like that story
when you're going to recruitment or you
really like your heart is somewhere else
in a different chapter don't be afraid
to take the chapter it I know people who
have gone into chapter then they're like
I knew I shouldn't pick this one but I
just did because I want to do this and
like that so fast me I just think it's
so important to choose where you think
you belong it's not about trying to fit
in somewhere else but don't go into
recruitment knowing that this is a top
Alister this is the best one like I just
feel like you guys should really choose
what chapter you want to be in based on
the conversations that you're having
with people based on the genuine people
that you meet feel like when you go into
a chapter and you feel like I can see
myself being with these girls every
single day I can see myself like going
to the movies with them going on road
trips with them like when you walk into
a chapter and you feel that I think that
that is like definitely where your heart
is supposed to be so don't get
distracted by like decorations and like
people cheering and things like that
like genuinely the conversations that
you guys are going to have during
recruitment I cried during recruitment I
know everyone's like oh my gosh likewise
crying to recruitment I even made fun of
people who cried during recruitment like
I was like crying for what like you're
getting in a sorority like you're dumb
but then I cried during recruitment I
was like wow what is my life so I just
feel like you guys should definitely
keep in mind that they want you for who
you are not for what sorority you're
trying to be in like they just want you
to be you and I it's just so so
important so
keep that in mind during recruitment I'm
going to also be answering a lot of
questions because I know this isn't
everything but I just want to genuinely
say how I thought about recruitment like
I didn't want to be in recruitment at
all I didn't want to be in a sorority
like at first I was and then not so for
sales like no I don't want to do this
anymore but I don't know what I would do
if it weren't for my chapter like if it
weren't for the store yo and right now I
just don't know like what friendships
that would have an Arizona like me going
to a completely different state not
knowing anyone like without my family
like oh I'm gonna cry
I'm Michael in genetic Ryder in this
video and it's so crazy like I don't
know without my fam I'm like without the
people that I've met in Arizona like I
just don't even know what I would do
like I literally think I would have
liked rock out of college like I
literally just would have been another
youtuber who just like quit but staying
in the sorority that like I chose to
stick with and like meeting all the
people that I've met and like going on
all these different adventures in
Arizona like it just made everything so
much more worth it and so if you are
very very skeptical of going into
authority or even going into rush like
if you're even scared of rushing I'm
telling you right now I genuinely think
that you should do it I really think
that you guys should sign up and just go
for it and in Phoenix like the first or
second day you're like okay no I know
you said I should go for it but I really
don't feel it then like that's okay if
you guys don't a rush like that's also
okay to it stories aren't everything
there's so many people I've met that are
not in tourneys so it's not a big deal
if you don't want to I feel like if
you're on the edge about and you kind of
want to I think that you should because
it's such an amazing experience and I
realize those real as soul I this is me
ranting about all my stories but I
genuinely love my authority so much and
I wanted to give you guys some advice
because there are so many things I wish
that I would have known that I was going
through so many things that they just
don't tell you and I wish I would have
known them so if you guys are interested
if at all in recruitment ask me whatever
questions you guys want to know in the
comments down below I'm going to be
responding as much as you can also to
tweet this video lot because I feel like
this is helpful I never asked you guys
to tweet any videos alpha like it
you're seeing people like having a hard
time be like hey watch this video this
is what you should do or if you guys
have a friend and they're like I'm not
going to recruitment and you are
business to them and be like do it bro
you better go you better go through
recruitment to you anyway guys this veil
is so super long so I hope you guys like
this video and yeah I will see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
