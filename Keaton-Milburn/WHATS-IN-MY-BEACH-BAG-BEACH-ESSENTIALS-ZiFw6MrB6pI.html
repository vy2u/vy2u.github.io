what's up guys I'm so happy to be
sitting here and talking to you and in
my last video was my first video back
but I wasn't like sitting down like
camera talk to you guys I'm just happy
to be filming I know this is a different
location
I'm really trying to test out different
spots just because I don't know we'll
see you guys like this but I feel like
really weird members on today's video
obviously is going to be a what's in my
beach bag or my beach bag essentials I
decided to make this video because
obviously it's summer going with the
whole summer video kind of theme ish do
I happen
Dean going I don't know don't hold me to
that but I really want you to this video
because I've been going to the beach and
going swimming and all that kind of
stuff a lot recently and when I go to
the beach it's like like luggage like I
bring like a bunch of stuff in might not
be a lot to you guys but I bring a bunch
of stuff that like I need and I know I'm
gonna want while I'm at the beach so I
just activate this video guys and show
you guys what I have just in case you
guys wanted tips or need anything to
bring to the beach or even to like the
lake or like just like outside and your
backyard I don't know anything that you
guys might be interested in so I hope
this video helps you guys and I will get
into the video know my sister's
facetiming me hey what color do you
think Stacey say hello I'm funny degree
no it's okay it's gonna go in the video
I really didn't think about this video
in my outfit because this is the bag
that I take to the beach and obviously I
didn't even play in this that's not you
I apologize
oh but this is the bag that I take to
the beach it is from brandy melville
along with my shirt obviously I didn't
even okay I just hate myself for doing
this it is just like a little backpack
it's smaller I don't know it's not too
big but it's the perfect size and I can
fit everything in it and I am
so um in this it's so beat-up I don't if
you totally has like a bunch of holes in
the front so in the front zipper up see
we have in here okay I have sunglasses
because obviously essentially so I have
two pair of sunglasses in here the first
pair is these I put these on when I want
to look like John Lennon okay the second
pair of sunglasses are these these are
like my favorite their reflective lens
and these are from Urban Outfitters both
of the pair are from Urban Outfitters so
I need sunglasses when I'm outside my
eyes are so sensitive to the Sun like if
I don't have sunglasses it's just not
okay the next thing I have in here is a
portable charger a portable charger is
the best for the beach because you're
playing music on your phone you're
literally just sitting out there tanning
and you're going to be on Instagram all
day long and your phone is going to die
so this one is from Mophie and it just
like opens up like this so cute and then
it has a little cord you can take out
and then we just close it back up and
you can charge your phone I don't know
it's really cute and taking a portable
charger to the beach is like a must if I
don't have one I don't know how I
survived because my phone get to 20% in
like 30 minutes
so next things are my Birkenstocks and
these are just like the black
Birkenstock I don't even know like what
the name of these are they're just like
black Birkenstocks and if these normally
wouldn't go like how does this even
happen to me I literally drop everything
okay these are really wouldn't go in my
bag but I would be wearing these to the
beach just because they're the perfect
beach shoes don't wear sneakers or like
converse to the beach honestly because
you're not going to tie them up and then
take them off and then there's somebody
sand in them later and you're gonna want
your off socks it's just no like laces
and like closed toe shoes I just I don't
wear those to the beach
Birkenstocks are the perfect these shoes
you just slide them on slide them all
they can get sandy then get wet it's
perfect in my big bag we have
so whenever I go to the beach I normally
wear something like casual like like
Nikes and a big t-shirt and then
normally after go to the beach we end up
having like go get food afterwards we
either go to like a restaurant or
something but I don't like the clothes
that I've been wearing so I feel like
sticky so I always pack an extra pair of
clothes so in here normally I would just
wear jean shorts to change into and then
like a crop top like this or just like
an open sleeve top to wear over my
bathing suit because I don't like bring
an extra ball or anything I just wear my
bathing suit but it's open on the side
it's also from brandy melville and it
has like a little wave so super beachy I
wore this last time I went to the beach
like literally this exact outfit and
it's just really really comfortable so
soft and it has a wave on it
so obviously oh my god server um the
next thing I'm gonna be showing you guys
I normally wouldn't pack in my bag but I
showed it to you guys so I can show you
my bathing suit of what I wear to the
beach because I posted it on my
Instagram it is this bathing suit this
is from triangle it is their new line of
the crochet knit like bathing suits it's
so cool so like this part isn't it it
looks like it's open which online I
thought that it was open but it's
actually not
but triangle sent me this so thank you
so much triangle I'm literally obsessed
with this the color of it oh my gosh
look how pretty that is the colors are
so perfect and like they just go I love
this bathing suit so this is a bathing
suit I'm gonna be wearing to the beach
all the time next thing I have in here
is deodorant and this is just the secret
ph-balanced powder Kraft regular powder
prep powder prep I just said powder
powder brush this is just regular
deodorant and this obviously semak's
mandatory you're sweating at the beach
all day long and you're going to smell
so I would also pack some perfume or
deodorant I just packed you honor it um
but like a little like body mist will be
good too
next I have sunscreen and I have tanning
oil so this sunscreen is the Coppertone
sport this is the BART broad-spectrum
SPF 70 so I use this I only spray this
on my face and then I spray it on my
shoulders because that is where I get
burnt the most and I really don't like
tanning my
because I don't know I just don't like
even when I get spray tans I don't pay
in my face I just take my body but
that's just me
so I use this on my face and my
shoulders and then I use the Hawaiian
Tropic dry oil broad spread shot the
broad-spectrum SPF 12 and then this just
smells like really really good and it's
tuning oil when I put this all over my
body for tanning love these four
thumbnail
the next thing I have in here is
chapstick and this is just the sugar
chapstick and it smells like vanilla
everything just gets so like dry and
burnt when you're outside and you're
like tanning you just the water sucks
all the energy out of you let's
literally app I mean like anyone else
when they're done tanning they just want
to take a nap and it just dries
everything out on my body I feel like a
lizard afterwards so I bring chapstick
because my lips get extra chapped when
I'm outside annek the last thing that I
want to show you guys is my tape Astri
so this I posted oh my gosh it's giant
this isn't even like I wish I could open
it all up for you guys it's literally so
massive it's not even opened up but this
is massive I got this from Urban
Outfitters and it's a tapestry I think I
just said tape a straight earlier um but
it is a tapestry and it's so so pretty
and you guys can bring towels to the
beach this is what I use as my towel
obviously I would bring another towel
but this is what I use when I go to the
beach I lay this just like on the sand
and it's perfect because it's so big so
like five people can lay on it and then
I bring a towel obviously more like why
do myself fall like wiping sand off and
everything but this I bring to the be
took this is a must
I'm obsessed with this this summer and I
don't know the exact name of it but I
know it's from Urban Outfitters and if I
find the name I will
don't blow duties that is everything
that is in my beach bag those are all of
my essentials and things that I
absolutely love and must-haves for the
beach comment down below what you guys
love bringing to the beach I want to

I need to bring because I need to I need
to pack like a suitcase so I'm going to
