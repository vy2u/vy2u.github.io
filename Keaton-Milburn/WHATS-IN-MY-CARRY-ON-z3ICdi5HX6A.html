pretty cool guys what's up guys today I
want to film a video and show you guys
what is in my carry-on bag obviously by
the title this you know what it is but I
want to explain it so basically it is my
spring break and by the time you're
watching this I will be in California or
on a plane to California
either one depends um but I've been
gonna be doing a lot of traveling and I
figured a lot of you guys see me doing a
lot of traveling too I know a lot of my
friends are in a bunch of different
places so I wanted to show you guys what
is in my carry-on bag just so I can give
you guys some tips on what to bring with
you on your carry-on bag not that I need
to tell you what to bring on your own
bag but just some things to help you out
okay so the first thing I'm gonna show
you guys is my carry-on bag so it is
this lovely backpack it is actually
really really tiny and real quick funny
story I bought this as my actual
backpack up and I ordered it from brandy
melville online and it looked really
really big and it's literally like the
size of my head so I guess as a lunchbox
now anyway I'm gonna show you guys
what's in the front small zipper and the
first thing that I have is this vlogging
camera that I use this is a GoPro Hero 3
plus I believe that's what it says all
the thing I'm gonna be vlogging the
whole time while I'm in California I see
you guys with me seeing daily vlogs and
stuff like that and so I bring my
vlogging camera everywhere especially on
the plane with me
next I have headphones headphones are oh
they're upside down and the headphones
are essential for me I don't want to
hear your child screaming I don't want
to hear you talking to me or smacking on
peanuts so I'm gonna put my headphones
in also I keep the little container that
it comes with like at the Apple store
because again I need help that was a
really cute dough scratch okay yeah next
is gum and the only reason that I bring
them is because my mom first told me
when I got on my first flight if you
chew gum it helps with the pressure and
your ears and stuff like that because I
would cry everytime the ears would pop
so this helps with that if you've never
flown on a plane before I suggest
chewing gum it really does help next I
have this little perfume this is the
people ahjussi Ted a little I don't even
know how much is in it but it's just a
so tiny perfume and I am
afraid of smelling next to the person
I'm on the air fine with so I don't want
them to smell me so you can also bring
deodorant if you would prefer that but I
bring this and it smells amazing it's my
favorite perfume so next I have my
charger so every turn juror I don't
really know why I have my charger I just
like to keep it with me because if you
check a bag or if you have like a big
luggage bag you don't want to keep
taking it in and out of your bag you
want to keep it close by so if you're
waiting on your flight you can just
charge your phone while you're waiting
and not dig through all your crap and
next is my phone yes it is shattered I
cut this for Christmas and it is like
completely shattered you can't even tell
but there's like a piece missing right
here I'm really cute next thing I like
to bring inside with me is a jacket or
sweater whatever you want to call it
this is like a little I guess it's a
cardigan that's what this is okay it's
from brandy melville and it's just like
a grey kind of purply color in person
but it's grey and it's just a long
sweater it always gets cold on flights
and I get really annoyed so I always
bring a jacket next I bring a a book so
right now with me I have John Green's
Paper Towns and I read this twice
already but because the movies coming
out and because it's my favorite john
green book and the entire planet um I
really really like this so I'm gonna
probably reread it or start reading it
on the plane I have this pool and I've
notice I think I've shown it in a
favorites video but I really really love
this planner and I know you're like what
are you planning on vacation but some
things like just come into my mind I'm
like let me write that down
so I bring my planner with me on the
plane in case oh woman like I don't know
figure my life out at some point
last thing that I bring is my computer
yeah okay if you're wondering where the
computer cases from this is from juicy I
believe I got it a few years ago but I
bring my computer with me and I don't
put this in my backpack or in a bag
because you're just gonna have to take
it out when you go through security and
all that junk and I bring my computer I
have movies on here or just anything I
want to do while I'm on the plane and I
just really like having my computer with
me I don't like leaving it in my luggage
people probably break it that's
basically all that I bring on the
airplane I don't bring any beauty
supplies just because I don't really
feel the need to retouch my makeup if
that makes any sense I don't like
recoding makeup on top of makeup because
if you like it makes my face like cakey
and I don't know I do my makeup once in
the beginning of the day and I wash it
at the end of the night and reapplying
my makeup it's just something that makes
me feel really really gross so I don't
bring any beauty supplies with me if I
don't our makeup on a plane then I bring
oil strips or anything like that maybe
moisturizer while I'm on the plane just
cuz my skin gets you know really really
dry or present really oily but I will
probably be wearing makeup when I'm on
the plane tomorrow because we land it
like 12:00 in LA oh yeah if you guys are
wondering when I'm going I'm gonna be in
Los Angeles I'll be there from March 9th
to the 14th and I'll be there all week
just like hanging out I have a photo
shoot and I'm doing a collab video ish
vlog I don't even know what it is but
I'm gonna be doing less stuff while I'm
in LA so if you guys live in LA comment
in the comments below I would like love
to know who lives there I just want to
like see where my viewers are and stuff
anyway thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you guys like this video
and if you do then like it give it a
thumbs up whatever if you're new to this
channel then welcome please subscribe if
you like my content and I will be
putting vlogs out every single day this
week I'm going to try my best which are
my very best I really really hope I
can't I really hope I'm like able to
edit upload whatever I'm not a daily
vlogger so this is like really new to me
um but yeah that's basically basically
so yeah that's basically it and I will
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
