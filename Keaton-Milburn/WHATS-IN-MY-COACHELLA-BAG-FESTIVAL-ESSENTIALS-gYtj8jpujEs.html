but you gotta be there for me too
what's up guys so today's video is going
to be my Coachella tips video for you
guys I'm not sure where I titled this
but I know that I'm going to pick of you
guys a bunch of tips for a Coachella
because last year was my first Coachella
it was so much fun but after my first
year I just realized there was so much I
wish I would have known before I went
and stuff I wish I would have brought
and it just it just honestly was a mess
for me and now that I'm going again this
year I'm like I have this I've got it
together and they're probably being a
lot more stuff that I need to learn as
well and I'll post another one next year
with like new things that I learned but
I figured I would show you guys what I'm
packing in my Coachella bag I can't like
my backpack stuff like that
so yeah let's just get into it if this
is your first video of mine don't forget
to subscribe it would mean so so much to
me I'm gonna be posting a ton of
Coachella get ready with me is that you
guys really really likes that I posted
last year that are so funny honestly
I'll link them all down below but and
this is your first time don't forget to
subscribe and yeah let's get into it so
this is the backpack that I brought last
year with me to Coachella it's honestly
just from forever 21 I'm pretty sure it
was like twenty dollars I'm like that's
super cheap I was going to buy a Louis
Vuitton backpack the ones that are like
super popular and they're like checkered
and everyone has them I was gonna buy
that and then I was like why am I going
to buy a Louboutin backpack to go to
Coachella in the desert and the dirt so
honestly if you guys are needing a
backpack go to front 21 when's our stuff
like that get one for like super super
cheap because I don't know it's just
super easy to use and it packs a look so
the first thing I have in my bag is
band-aids these are so important and I
wish I would have brought these last
year I have so many blisters from
walking around all day and like my
booties and just uncomfortable shoes
this year I'm gonna try and wear more
comfortable shoes but band-aids are
essential and we were literally running
around Coachella everywhere like going
to a little convenience store is in
there buying overpriced band-aids
because we didn't pack any so please
please please even if you don't think
you're going to need them pack band-aids
they are so important next up this might
not apply to you but I always bring
contacts because it is really really dry
outside and it's like dirt everywhere so
at night when the wind blows if you have
contacts to your context it's super dry
and dirty-minded now it's like oh my god
I wish I would've probably solution or
contacts or something I don't know if
you can bring solution into Coachella so
I just have this pair of con
and I bring them so in case mine dry out
I'll just like take them out and throw
them and put new ones in so that my eyes
feel better because towards the end of
the night my contact just like dry out
and I can't wear them anymore and it's
so annoying if you're trying to like
watch music and you just can these baby
hairs are just like this next thing also
goes long with like it being like dirt
everywhere and the dirt blows at night
when it's windy so I would bring a
bandana not only are these acute and
trendy and everyone wears bandanas but
you put them over your nose and your
mouth and the dirt doesn't get in your
mouth are like in your nose or anything
like that if you have been allergies I
highly suggest this tan when I got from
Urban Outfitters I don't know why I
bought from urban go to Hobby Lobby and
get one super cheap I also have like
really pretty ones like this if you guys
want like silk ones I got this from
brandy but I know that these are like
super popular at a bunch of different
stores I'm sure like in forever 21 and
just get like a little scarf or
something like that just tighter on your
mouth at night super cute and it helps
keep all like the dirt and stuff away
next are two different cameras so the
first one is the insects Instax yeah
insects mini s7d you guys can your
things that urban outfitters you guys
know you guys have seen these it's a
Polaroid camera I absolutely love this
one and you can't bring any camera in to
Coachella that you can detach the lens
from so you can't bring like a huge
camera in there it's just like they
won't let you
so this is perfect and it's super cute
and trendy along with that I also bring
a vlogging camera this also can be used
for like any pictures literally all my
friends even if they're not youtubers
they have this camera now because I take
it everywhere it has Wi-Fi on it this is
the canon g7x I don't think I said that
but it has Wi-Fi on it has everything
you need on this camera and it's such
good quality it's perfect for Coachella
so I'll be bringing this along with like
this Polaroid camera and if I can sneak
in a big camera I'm gonna try and do
that but I don't know
along with the camera I would highly
suggest bringing two separate batteries
that is if you want to like bring a
professional ish like type of camera you
don't want it dying because there's
nowhere you can charge it there are
charging stations but it's just like
who's gonna really sit idle coachella
charging station the whole time and you
don't even have a service so it's like
why sit there and do that thing so I
bought two extra batteries for when I go
so all three of my batteries will be
charged so if one of them dies I'll have
an extra and in discharge of every night
while in there next up is sunscreen you
cannot bring aerosol sunscreen so if you
have like the spray sunscreen you can't
bring it in
I think somebody I know likes naqudae
because it's not that big of a deal but
they aren't supposed to have it there
they will take it if they see it so this
is the radical skin scare skin scare
skincare skin perfecting sunscreen SPF
30 I'm sure you guys would get higher if
you guys want to get higher SPF but this
is just what I use you guys can bring
any like cream look cream is it a cream
lotion whatever kind of sunscreen just
not aerosol because they do take it when
you guys are going through and secured
yet but shell us so and there's going to
be a lot more security this year because
of everything that has happened and
music festivals in the past you guys
know what happened in Vegas so Michelle
is going to be like super super lockdown
so I would try not to like sneak
anything in that you guys know is on the
list of things not to bring so don't
bring aerosol sunscreen bring normal
sunscreen a lot of people are worried
about bugs at night there aren't any
bugs at night there's like literally not
mosquitoes nothing at night like there
there's just like no bugs so don't worry
about bringing bugs for anything I did
that last year and I was like I'm so
stupid I live in Arizona I know that
there's not bugs at night I'm just these
next products aren't technically what I
would bring like in my bag I mean you
can't I wouldn't bring these in my
backpack they're just beauty products so
these are the L'Oreal Paris color recess
for a one day color so a lot of people
are wanting to do like colored hair and
stuff for Coachella and it's super fun
but I cannot dye my hair anymore because
it's literally fried off to its ends as
you can tell so this is a super super
good what is the word these are a super
good dupe for that so this is just spray
color on diet I have literally every
color I have every color year there's
rose gold purple light purple lavender
green hot pink light blue I have every
color here and there from L'Oreal and
you just learned
bring them in the end or spray them like
on a braid in your hair something like
that and it looks really really cute and
you just wash it out the next day and
literally fade so quick like these
normally fade throughout the day so if
you wanted to you could pack these in
your bag but I don't know if you can
because they are aerosol so I don't know
if you can but if you guys are looking
for something really cool to do with
your hair but you guys don't want to dye
it I recommend these you guys also saw
me talk about these in my last festival
get ready with me but these are the fun
sexy hair mermaid glow glitter this is
such a tongue twister mermaid glow get
our root glitter gel so that is what
these are they are glitter if you guys
want to see how you use them you guys
can go watch my festival we'll get ready
with me they're so easy to use and again
if you guys are not wanting to die here
but you guys want to do something really
fun really cool I would highly suggest
these because they look really awesome
and anyone does color hair like it looks
so good and it's just glittering to
those so next up is a pair of sunglasses
as you guys know these are the ones I
think I'm gonna bring I'm not a big
sunglass girl like if I have sunglasses
they're normally just to like go with an
outfit they're not normal you want to
leave these here they're not normally to
like we're out in the Sun which is not
the purpose of them but I'm just like a
glasses gal just for looks not really to
like shade the Sun but I do recommend
sunglasses if you guys have since
advised blue eyes are super sensitive so
I should be more worried about that but
I'm not next up is agile I would HIGHLY
highly highly recommend bringing advil
same thing with the band-aids like advil
and band-aids I would highly recommend
like don't leave those out because I
feel so important it's really really
easy to get a headache from either being
like dehydrated or the music is too loud
or there's lights everywhere and you
just easily get headaches if you do
please please breathe bring Advil
because it'll help you so much I needed
Advil so many times honest year and I
just was like wow why did I not think to
pack anything that I actually needed
afford beauty supplies these are things
that are like custom to you
but I would highly recommend bringing a
powder this one is the covergirl vinyls
healthy powder in the shade 725 it
literally just comes like a little
sponge in there it's easy to get like
sweaty and you're oily and you need to
set your face again so I would bring a
powder you guys can bring a translucent
powder if that's what you want it's just
going to set your face throughout the
day
sweating it gets really really really
hot like so hot you guys are going to
want to set your face so I would bring a
little compact powder like this along
with that your lip color will probably
come off I don't care what lip color you
have if you have a really good lip color
honestly maybe you won't but I would
bring your lip liner and your liquid
lipstick or lipstick or gloss or
something whatever it is that you put on
that day I would pack it in your bag
because in all your pictures when your
lipstick is literally falling off after
you see like five watermelon you're
gonna be up so upset because your lips
are gonna look bare and they're gonna
look nude and that's how mine were last
drive so many selfies and I have skin
tone lip color because all my lip color
came off and I was stupid and I didn't
bring a lip liner or lip color so next
up this is a really boozy accessory not
even accessory it's just stupid item but
I hate like I am bringing it I am I
don't care I don't know if they'll let
this in cuz it is a spray but this is he
a V on water spray yes
it's a can of water yes it's freeze out
like a stream but oh my god it is so hot
and it is scorching outside and you're
going to be dying you're going to be so
hot and you're literally gonna be like
oh my god I want to jump in a pool right
now but you can't cuz I'm messy makeup
up so a V on water spray feels amazing
on your body I can always bring the
stick which Alex I'm just little
alluring whip it out while I'm like
watching someone just be like the other
mad because I feel so good and y'all are
sweating to death and I'm not so if you
guys want they sell these at like
Sephora and like literally mini section
of the front I bought these in a pack of
two and they were like overly expensive
for literally no reason and I still
bought them because I was like I kind of
want to bring this to Coachella just
because I'm bushi like that and that's
what I want to do next up is lash glue I
apply false lashes every single day of
Coachella because that is just what I'm
going for I'm not trying to have some
bear lashes but I applied them so bad
and so wrong that maybe an hour after I
play them they start like peeling at the
end so bring lash glue because your
eyelashes will probably fly off they're
also really it's also really windy while
you're at Coachella so you're gonna want
like lash glue and your lashes and
everything to stay on no matter if
you put really good last do one they
might peel up on the ends and you don't
want to be like out there with like one
lash like curling up so bring lash glue
next up aren't tampons so you never know
when you're going to tell your parents
you should always have two implants on
you at all times like literally and
every single person you own you should
probably have at least two tampons in
there because you never know when you're
gonna start your parent and the worst
possible thing that could happen is used
to writing your prayer down Coachella
they have tampons there they have
community service there but it's just
like so much more comfortable when you
know like oh I have one in my bag I'm
good to go so I would pack at least like
two or three if you start while you're
there it's super helpful rubber bands
these are so important because after you
get all your little Instagram pictures
that you take all your pictures by the
ferris wheel and you run around to all
the art structures that you take on your
Instagram pictures you're sweating the
back of your neck is sweating and you're
not gonna let your hair down especially
if you have 40 pounds of exceptions like
I do you're going to want to put your
hair up so I always bring over bands or
bobby pins or something so I can put my
hair up so it's not in the way and I'm
just like way more comfortable lastly is
hand sanitizer this one's are really
small and from Bath and Body Works but I
would recommend going and just getting a
travel sized hand sanitizer because
everything is dirty so you don't know
where people at Coachella have been what
they touched if you go up to an art
structure and you're like touching on it
and everything's just like dirty
it just really grosses me out and I like
to be clean when I'm in place like that
hand sanitizer is just a must if you
just have to have that I there's nothing
I can say about it like you just have to
have it the last thing that I would
recommend that you have that I don't
actually like physically have to show
you right now is a portable charger
because again like I said you guys are
not going to want to be charging your
phone at a charging station at coachella
because you're gonna be missing the
entire concert and all the music going
on all that you're gonna just want to
have a portable charger with you just so
that you don't have to do anything I
would recommend a multi case they sell
those at the Apple store and they also
sell like a huge multi one that's like
it's pretty expensive but it charges
your phone for like nine hours or
something like crazy like that like it
adds nine hours on to your phone or
something so I would recommend going to
the Apple store and like investing in a
good portable charger not a cheap one
because I have bought cheap ones at
music festivals before when my phone was
dying I like fall when really quickly
and it literally charged it like 10% and
then the portable charger was like
and it's like how do you charge a
portable charger you just like can I
also want to say I did not camp a
Coachella last year I stayed at a hotel
so that's why a lot of my things are
just like things that I would bring from
the hotel with me if you guys have a
camping site it's going to be a lot
different because you guys can actually
go to your camping site if you forget
things
for me I just had to like bring
everything that I would need and I can't
go back and get it out of my hotel which
is like 30 minutes away like it's just
not how it works so if you guys are
staying in a camping site it will be a
little bit different it is close to the
festival so it's easier for you guys I'm
going to be filming all microcell
outfits where all the pieces are from
and everything while I'm there so I'm
super excited to put that up for you
guys these are just a few things that I
want to show you guys that I would pack
in my backpack what I'm going to be
bringing to Coachella this is literally
everything I'm gonna have maybe a little
bit more just depending but this is
everything I'm gonna have so I hope you
