be a what this into my purse video and
this has been requested for quite a
while I just never filmed it cuz I was
like why does anyone care but then the
other day I was thinking about it and I
was like I have so many random things in
my purse and I was just like maybe
people will actually want to see this so
that is what I'm doing today also I am
back my dorm I am in Arizona school has
started up for me again so that is what
I'm doing so it videos are a little
shaky from here on out that is because a
little bit harder to film while I'm in
college so so this is my persistence I
take this ever with me I wish it wasn't
as big as it is I'm looking into buying
a backpack like I'm trying to save my
money this year so I can buy a really
nice backpack for myself I know that's
weird
but um I really want one because this is
so heavy all the time and I just want it
on my back and I don't know I just want
a cute nice little designer backpack but
anyway this the purse I have it is
Louboutin and I think it is called never
full which is a lie because this is
always full it weighs 500 pounds and it
didn't come with this keychain my
stepdad got this for me this was a
graduation present and I'd asked for for
so so long so I'm really just happy that
I even have this um so let's just start
with what's in my purse so on the purse
it comes with this pouch and as you can
see it is attached to the purse you can
you take it off yeah you can take it off
but it is a touch the purse inside of
here I have a bunch of gift cards so
this is just like so many good cards
most of these are from Christmas and a
lot of them are like you stuff I don't
think a lot of them work just goes on
broke I have a bad the body work a
little coupon in here I have oh my god
this is a Starbucks gift card oh yeah I
can't wait for that I also have one of
these little Sephora mirrors because you
know they always give you these I like
700 of these but I think in my purse in
case I ever
just like need a mirror and it's just
tight tight it's just small and easy to
go around with okay so the next bag is
so ratchet and my sister and everyone
always makes fun of me because my
grandma got me this for Christmas and it
is actually like a bag made from a few
like like a shop in Africa that these
women make and then you buy it and then
like the money goes to them but my
sister always makes fun because it's so
Brad but I keep like really nice
things in here
so I have these sunglasses these are
Prada and I got these I think for my
birthday and I really love them so I
literally use this bag as like my
product glasses piece okay anyway I have
some Kiehl's ultimate strength handsel
which I love go ahead where I just put
these in there because I'm obsessed
these are cool glasses USA they're the
Laurens glasses that's these I keep them
in case my contacts are bugging me I
have some hand sanitizer this is the
marshmallow pumpkin latte from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works this stuff smells bomb I
assume that I put it on my hands on the
plane and like the romance routes like
that's also good I was like I know I
know um next I have this is so to Yuma I
have a few little TMI items in here but
I have liners I have cami liners and I
also have tampons in here because like I
need to also I literally wear panty
liners every single day I don't care if
I'm on my period I wear them every
single day because it makes me feel more
comfortable and oh no I'm just as you'll
see in a minute I'm really
self-conscious about you know my areas
smelling anyways so I have some perfume
this is from the perfume it's like that
thing where you get like designer
perfume but you put it in like this to
go umm travel thing I have a black pen
in here let's see what else I have
lipstick this is Maybelline
in the shade hot sand and this is a
really pretty nude I think I don't
remember even producing it yeah just
don't need lipstick I don't know maybe
just in case I want some I have a
wristband this is from beauty : I think
yeah this is beauty Connie you're a
rubber band and one broken hearing like
literally this is the earring and this
is a bit I broke it so next I have a
wallet the purse I used to have for like
years was like this army green Michael
Kors purse and this is the wallet that
went with it and I keep it in here I
really need to get like a real wallet
but I don't care this just has a bunch
of the old stuff you stab in it gift
cards it has like a few ones in here but
I honestly don't use this wallet that
much so I just keep it in here in case I
forget I have like a little Louboutin
like it's a tiny Travel one and it has
like my credit card in my license all my
other stuff and that one and I travel
with that when everywhere just cuz it's
smaller so if I ever forget to bring the
little one with me I have a little bit
of cash in this one because I always
carry this next I have some boys and I
just cut these for Christmas my mom was
like girl your breath stinks so yeah I
put these in my purse
I also have my vlog camera I like to
travel with this just in case mainly I
just use this to take pictures every
single day because I love the quality of
the pictures on this camera so I really
like it to travel with that and then the

cloths for sensitive skin this is
basically vaginal white I carry these
with me everywhere again I like have a
phobia of like being around people and
like smelling like I never want like
that to ever smell like I literally am
scared of it

first is you guys can there's a side
zipper right here so what's in here is

sunglasses in so the sunglasses are in
here and they're just these little round
ones oh I have a bracelet on that bucket

don't know it's really cute so I have
that in there next I have this little

I'm literally shows up on also like if
