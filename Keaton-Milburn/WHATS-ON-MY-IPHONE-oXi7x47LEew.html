to be a oh what's on my iPhone and
probably the only reason I'm doing this
video is because you guys have requested
it so so much like everything once
you're in picture post you guys are
commenting - it's on my iPhone every
video I post you guys are commenting -
it's on my iPhone that's that's me
voices that's what I imagined so today
I'm gonna be doing that and let's just
hop right into it so for the first part
of this what's on my iPhone why is my
hand in the shot going like this okay um
I have an iPhone 6 yeah iPhone 6 and
it's just gold and like yeah it looks
like an iPhone okay my home screen is a
picture of me and Lyndon that we took at
a Christmas party and then my password
is okay so this has all the regular
options you would regularly use and then
I just have Instagram Tumblr and Twitter
I'll put my Instagram which is at kkeo
it's really annoying and then my tumblr
I will list right here and my Twitter I
will also list right here
and then and this folder is another
thing it comes with its like a little
music apps and random stuff and then
this one is photograms so this app
basically tells me how many followers I
have exactly I can't show you right now
cuz I have no service but it like
basically um shows me the right amount
of Instagram followers that I have it
doesn't show you who unfollow so or
anything and then this app is Rap City
so this app shows not shows it has music
that you pay monthly for which I use
that because I don't know I just like it
a little bit better and then this is
snapchat never use it obviously I have
one snap that like isn't opened because
know that snaps me because why would
anyone snap me okay this is Shazam so
basically whenever a song is playing you
can just click that and then it will
tell you who the artist is until you
who's singing it this is obviously vine
I never ever really even check my vine
like literally ever
this app is an app that I actually used
for school but it's there's no point of
me showing you that this is an app
called pic frame so it's how you can
make a bunch of different collages so it
has all of these and then you can just
select it and then pick what your photo
you want and just add it this is also
another one that you can use to add the
white border or put two pictures next to
each other so I can do this picture and
say I wanted that and then if I wanted
this another picture I could add this
and then it puts it on the white border
for you but I don't really use my
borders anymore so it's not really
helpful and then this app is vsco cam
which this is an editing app a lot of
people use this app but I use it to edit
literally all of my pictures so that is
what I use let's pick a picture okay so
you can do a lot of really cool things
so this is a picture to close in the
bath and so this is where you click and
you can add any of these effects so the
one I've been using a lot right now is a
nine I just think it makes everything
look a lot cooler and then I would go to
my settings and maybe brighten it up a
little bit and then go to sharpen and I
turn my sharpen up really really um deep
really really high okay and that would
be the picture and then you just save it
to your camera roll and that's basically
all you do but it's really fun to like
play around with so this is the app I
used to edit every single Instagram
picture this app is SoundCloud so it was
just a music app that has music feed
it's kind of like Instagram but for
music this app is after light so anytime
you see pictures that have like the
light on them and anytime it's like
anything like that so take this picture
for example you can add any you it has
effects but I don't really use it for
that but you can add a light onto it so
it looks kind of like that or you can
add like a random line I don't know it
just looks kind of cool
this app is called instant which this
app is actually super cool use go to
your photo album if you want or you can
take a picture and you just take a
picture and say you want to crop it like
that it prints out like a Polaroid and
then you can blow into it and then it'll
develop I guess that sounds really weird
but you can blow into your microphone
and then a novella or you can just wait
for it but if you like shake it it comes
faster and then it's then this app is
called pics art I don't really use that
but you can just basically put any fonts
you want on a picture um this app is
retouched so I use this if there's
something in a picture that I don't want
there let's say there's a picture that I
don't want something in I can go get
this lasso like say I don't want say I
don't want these lines right here I can
circle them and then I click go
and then it replaces them with whatever
I circled so because I circled water and
then I put it over here it like replaces
it obviously I wouldn't yet because that
looks ugly but that's what I use that
for this one is frame attic I don't even
know what this is this is another
picture frame at I don't what the heck
is it doing I don't need this let's
delete that this app is Square D so you
can use that to put a white border I
don't really use that a lot this app I
got from my friend Hallie and I did a
video with her if you watched my vlogmas
but this app is so cool so you can pick
any picture it's called glitch and so
say you want like a glitch you can like
scan it and then like pause it and then
it adds glitches or it can add like scan
so here let's see if I can go back so
this one is called scan which I really
likes you can take the picture and then
just move it and like smear the picture
I don't know it has really really cool
effects on it like I don't know it makes
it like wavy and all that kind of stuff
I love this app
next I have this app which is just
utilities not this app at this circle
which is utilities and then I have my
Bible app and then I also have iBooks
which I use them both a lot and then
this one I have Amazon because Amazon
Prime hello that's what I use and then I
have Etsy which I never use Etsy I think
I use it once and I don't even know why
like I don't even never use that this is
my disk so it's actually a private app
that locks certain things so no one else
can get into it and I use that just
because I have ugly pictures of people
and sometimes when I don't want to when
people take care of phone and then they
look through your photos and then they
see you taking selfies it's a really
really awkward so I like to put a lot of
my selfies and this folder so that no
one can see them I don't know I'm weird
and then this app is really cool it's
called Goodreads so it just basically
keeps track of your books that you've
read so you can go to your my books and
then you can go to read and it lists
every book that you've read that you've
entered in and then you can go to to
read so you can make a list of books
that you want to read and then once
you've completed them you can move them
to read read books so I found that
really cool just I like to read so yeah
um this app is the dictionary app and I
use this for school a lot because or
when writing papers or anything if I
need synonyms or something I just go to
that app or any word I need to look at I
use that this app is another music app
it's Spotify and I use this for music
obviously if you have internal Spotify
and I can make playlists but I don't
ever make my own I just listen to
everyone else's the next folder is this
app so this is my Nike running so when I
go running that tracks it see it shows
how far I've been running and my time
and all that kind of stuff and then this
is my Nike training so this one's really
cool it actually has a bunch of
different workouts you can do and so you
can go to
you can go to my workout so you can
click one and then click one you like
and you can just start it and then it
has a bunch of workouts and it's a 15
minute workout you can choose between a
bunch but I like this just when I need
like a really quick workout and my phone
does this a lot I don't know why it does
that
but if anyone knows how to fix that let
me know and then this is the rodeo
Houston app I literally never have even
used that app even when it's the rodeo I
don't even know why it's in my Nike app
this first app is called bands in town
and this just shows concerts that are in
your area so it says Houston Texas at
the top and then it will load all the
concerts and it syncs with your music
like app or whatever on your iPhone so
that it shows all your artists and who
you want to go see and then you can RSVP
and show which ones you're going to this
one is Dropbox is just an app so I can
get the pictures that I've taken off of
my computer and send them to myself so I
don't have to email up your picture to
myself and stuff like that this app is
the nikon app so I use this for my
camera and what I use it for is usually
take pictures on your camera and then I
have a built-in Wi-Fi so I can just
automatically view the pictures and save
them to my phone this app is the weather
app and I find this a lot more useful
than my actual weather app that's built
into the iPhone so I use this a lot more
just obviously tells the weather and
then this one is a app that I use so I
can send in pictures from my phone into
my Polaroid printer so I can put them
print them out as a Polaroid this is my
Netflix app and this is probably one of
the top most used apps on my phone I
have been watching friends I'm on season
5 and don't tell me anything that
happens I will literally block you from
my Instagram I'll be so mad for my
youtube no manuscript but I have been
using this app I watched Netflix like
during school in the morning when I wake
up anywhere I watch Netflix so that is
the best app ever to download on my
phone
this app is ice for at because I've been
buying a lot of makeup
online lately so just why not get on
your phone and then this one is my
Edmodo app so if you guys don't use
Edmodo we use it for school and we use
that to keep track of like what our
teachers are posting there's a worksheet
that we didn't get they post it on there
and we can download it and do homework
and stuff like that also if you guys
