am sleeping in my bed okay like every
morning routine I'm going to wake up
from my sleep
and I am sleeping this giant monkey that
I have I don't know it just is so soft
so normally when I wake up the first
thing I do is check my phone obviously
because I cannot start my day without
going on Twitter Instagram everything so
I love checking all my emails and stuff
right before I get out of bed kind of to
remind myself of what I need to do for
the day so I'm just you know scrolling
on Twitter and memes definitely it makes
my day go a lot better so after I'm done
I will head downstairs so also hope you
guys don't mind some of this is like
vlog style I just thought it was a
little bit more personal than someone
like filming me like walking around my
house I feel like that's a low key kind
of weird so I did it a little bit vlog
style but I am heading to the kitchen to
get some coffee and I literally have
like three cups of coffee a day if I
don't I have a major migraine so I am
making myself some coffee at my Keurig
and I'm going to be adding some equal
you know some little sweetener I had
some milk some sugar all that good stuff
so once I'm done stirring my coffee I
will go back upstairs for the most part
I don't really like have breakfast I
don't know that's kind of like I don't
know maybe that's bad but I really
normally eat breakfast so I just get my
coffee I head back upstairs and because
of this December of course I am doing
vlogmas so I will just lay in bed I will
start editing and uploading the next
vlog for the day so if you guys are
wondering my vlog channels like with
Keaton you guys can go check it out it's
always always linked below and you guys
really like my blogs this year so I love
you guys for that but yeah I'll probably
just start uploading my vlogmas from the
day before and once I'm done with that
I'm heading to the shower and I'm going
to beginning is so personal with you
guys so basically I have a dandruff for
like the longest and so I'm using my
head and shoulders instant relief
shampoo seriously guys this has hell
my scalp so much especially because I've
always told you guys I have dry skin I'd
never talked about my dry scalp because
it's kind of embarrassing but using head
and shoulders has really really helped
that it cools my scalp down it leaves me
flake free and also just really helps my
hair stay really healthy and smooth so
if you guys are looking for a shampoo
that will help you with this this is the
one it also is peppermint so it
literally smells amazing and feels
amazing so I leave it in for about three
to six minutes or so and then I just
like wash my body shave do other things
like that but I love this so I'm leaving
it in obviously here and also I'm
obsessed with Odell Beckham jr. because
I have no he he plays for the Giants and
he uses head and shoulders and he's all
of my life so I basically feel like
we're twinning in this but anyway so I'm
rinsing it out now and I am hopping out
of the shower so then I'm going to get
ready for the day I was going to church
this day and so I picked out my outfit
if you guys again want to see any of
this day I did vlog and I'm doing
vlogmas so once I'm ready I will go into
the other room so that I can do my
makeup so if you guys want to see how I
got from this no makeup pale self to
this I am uploading a video tomorrow and
it is my everyday makeup routine and it
is like my favorite video ever so yeah
then I'm blow-drying my hair just
because it was really cold outside this
day I did not want to go outside with
wet hair you know that is the worst umm
so yeah I'm just brushing it out and I
am done so this is my winter morning
routine I hope you guys liked it don't
forget to subscribe comment and like
this video if you guys liked it and yeah
I will see you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
