to address my hair it is purple know if
you guys don't have me on my vlogging
channel go check it out I showed how I
dyed it and if you guys want like we
need to talk about the process of dyeing
it a little bit more in here let me know
in the comments but I did diet I wanted
to have it this color forever and I
don't know I really really love it all
so go look at my blogging channel just
because I'm doing vlogmas and it's
really fun and I look like showing you
guys my video life over there but
today's video is going to be a haul and
I'm so excited about this some of these
items obviously are not for winter
specifically just because I don't live
in a cult like I don't live where it
snows I live in Arizona and right now
I'm home in Texas and it doesn't snow
here it doesn't get really cold it's
like 80 degrees outside right now so
also this is my version of winter so the
first item I'm going to talk about is
actually from a thrift store it's from
Buffalo Exchange and I bought this
sequined jacket so it has like flowers
and sequins on it and the brand that
actually is is called Knight bow which I
looked it up and it's like 7 days like
vintage sequin things and I bought this
because I was at free people and they
have jackets so similar to it that are
like all sequined jackets it's really
cute designs but I was like these are so
expensive I was like 100 something
dollars and then I was there shopping
and I saw this one and I was like this
is so cool and I just think it's really
a different piece that you can style so
I'm really excited about styling this
next I have two things from Urban
Outfitters the first one is this leotard
bodysuit kind of thing the top is all
sequins and the bottom is like a satin
silk color but you probably wouldn't see
that if I was wearing it with jeans I
love this and I specifically bought it
for in New Year's Eve for like a New
Year's Eve party because I love sequins
for New Year's Eves everyone wears like
a sequined dress anything like that and
I thought this would be such a cute idea
to style especially because I'm gonna
have purple hair and I know people with
colored hair like
think like if you have color here you
can't wear things me I'm the opposite if
it's a color I am not supposed to wear
employer I will most likely where I do
stick to like neutrals I'm wearing like
black and gray today but I'm gonna wear
orange with foreplay or either way so
I'm definitely going to ring this for a
New Year's
the next thing from Urban Outfitters is
this cropped hoodie and it's just a gray
cropped hoodie I don't know this is from
the out from under line I think it is
it's like the pajama in the half but I
just think it's so cute I've been
wanting a cropped hoodie for so long
like I just think they're so cute with
leggings high-waisted jeans like
anything truffles like you can literally
style these hoodies in so many different
ways I just think they're really really
cute to style so I love this yet next
item is super random I got this after I
went to a party and I forgot the bra so
I brought my friends bra and I was like
wait this is the best I've ever had in
my life it's from Victoria's Secret and
it is just this lace it only has like
the lining here and I bought it because
after wearing it I was like this is the
most comfortable bar I've ever worn and
I just think it's really really pretty
like I just love that it's like black
and I was like a little lace and it has
two bones at the top I just thought it
was really cute so I got that Brown
Victoria Secret I am in love with
turtlenecks and so I bought two grey
turtlenecks the first gray turtleneck is
this one this is from brandy melville
and it's just a simple gray trim I could
have this in black from there and I wear
it like almost every day so I was like
let's get a gray one and then I bought a
sweater turtleneck also from brandy and
this is just really cute and comfy and I
was like I need more sweaters even
though it's not as cold here but
sometimes it is so I was just like you
know what get a sweater and so of course
I bought two grey turtlenecks from
Brandy's so now onto my favorite stuff
ever all of this stuff about to show you
is from Lulu's calm I absolutely love
Lulu as you guys know this already every
single I do always have to lose because
their stuff
it's so good every time I get a package
I'm like this is the best day ever it's
like Christmas for me right now so I'm
gonna show you a few things I got from
Lulu so let's just get into it I'm so
excited
so the first item I got are these boots
and these are just black like I was
gonna say booties but I feel like
they're like almost not even like
booties like they're just really cute I
know these are really in right now but I
don't know everyone's wearing boots like
this like a like high up on the ankle
and are just like tight so I really
needed some I don't have flat booties
and I don't have nude booties so I was
like I need to get these black ones and
then I got nude ones when I moved to
Arizona I didn't have any of the same I
used to wear all my mom's shoes so now I
didn't have any shoes so I got these off
of Lulu's I think there's Steve Madden
yeah I think they're Steve Madden but I
love them they're like suede nudish like
taupe color I just really really love
these boots and if you guys are
wondering these are eight-and-a-half
they fit perfect the sizing on both of
the shoes is really really great so I
love these I just really needed some
booties
next I got this scarf Appa blows this is
a checkered like I don't want to say
plaid it is just more checkered and I
just really liked the colors of it I
love like the blue shade of this and I
like when it's like white blue mixed
with navy and like orange I just think
it's so pretty it's good for winter it's
good for fall next I wanted to order
something like this for the longest time
and it's so simple but it's just this
black fitted dress it has a zipper in
the back and it's just a really good
fitted black dress that's just like a
tank I saw a few at H&amp;amp;M but they were
really really thin and this one is super
thick like it's like you cannot see
through this like it is sucking you in
like it holds everything in place and
it's perfect and I just really like this
I feel like if it were this was like
either like bootie is a nice jacket and
jewelry or you can dress it down and
wear like sneakers and like a hoodie
okay let's not okay so the next item is
this
pink soap ish satin romper and it looks
kind of like pajamas but it has like a
zipper in the front and it is really
cute I was I really wanted to wear this
on Christmas morning but me and my
parents my family we all do matching
pajamas on Christmas morning so I can't
but I just really think this is so cute
just for like I still pull mine out like
a cute little dinner or something like
that you can dress this up with like
cute booty is a lot of jewelry and stuff
like that or you can like dress it down
and wear it as pajamas I don't know I
just love this and they have it in black
too so I was like this is a yes yes for
me even with my purple hair people this
black oversized dress it's like a
sweater dress it has a turtleneck part
to it it's long sleeve I just love this
I think it would be really cute with
fishnets and like high-waisted booties
or whatever it is like thigh high
booties I love the look of this and it's
so comfy and it's perfect for layering
which I know like a lot of this stuff is
not super super warm for you obviously
but I think that layering is key so like
even this with a scarf and like a jacket
and so much stuff you can do with just
this simple piece so I love this okay
the next item you guys are gonna be like
eating what are you doing but it is this
body suit it's like this and I thought
this was so so pretty because it's all
just like lace and open and stuff and I
was thinking with high-waisted like
black jeans and like a belt and like a
cute little jacket and like chokers and
stuff I thought this would be so so
pretty to style just because I don't
know I really like it
I love body suits obviously they're
really and they're really really easy to
wear like a bunch of different things so
I shut this no you and I was like the
last two things are jacket this I'm so
excited about guys this is like a Navy
leather jacket it's kind of cropped I
love other jackets especially in the
winter I just think they're the perfect
piece to wear and like layer things
underneath it
a cute turtle necks like a leather
jacket like that's a look people like it
is a look but anyway I love this and
they also have a black ones and stuff
online but I just really wanted to need
you when I thought it was a little bit
different I mean I like I want a black
leather jacket too but I just want to
get the name because I thought it was
different
the last jacket is this like velvety of
Barmer kind of and it has flowers on the
front and flowers on the back and I just
love the way this looks it's so soft on
the inside
it's like silk satin on the inside and I
also love that it's like velvet I just
think that's really cute Velvets really
in right now especially for winter I
just think that that's like a look
everything to look okay Lulu's always
has the best ones like I was there were
so many bombers on there that I was like
