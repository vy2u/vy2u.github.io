obviously going to be a little different
from the title of this I told you guys
like a month or so ago in a Q&amp;amp;A that I
really really want to talk about the
subject and before I get into like the
rest of this video first of all I'm
filming this video when I'm home and for
Christmas break but I'm definitely not
uploading it while I'm home one because
I like I'm fine like I am great like I'm
happy I'm chillin and I don't really
want to upload this and then have people
like oh my god what's going on your life
because this is something that Isaac
wanted to talk about but I'm not trying
to let it like ruin my holidays I don't
want people to like message me and be
like are you good like what was your
YouTube video about because like I'm
fine so I definitely want to upload it
when I'm not home so that like percent
I'm contacted because like people who
actually talk to me on a daily basis
like people who are so so close to me
like actually understand this and so I
just don't upload a lot home anyway
moving on from that the second reason is
because I I feel like it's going to take
me a while to upload this video so I'm
just going to get right into I'm
literally like sitting crisscross and
just in like a big t-shirt and I have
firmware so I don't know how many videos
have uploaded with purple hair by this
point but I purple air in case I never
uploaded the video whisper where um so
this video is going to be about
self-confidence and depression and so I
want to start this video off by kind of
saying the reason that I'm sharing this
and the reason I'm sharing this is
because I feel like a lot of people talk
about their journey with self-confidence
and depression on YouTube and I never
watched videos about it when I was like
going through this basically and I kind
of wish that I would have watched videos
and people tell me things but I want
like I wish someone on YouTube would
have told me this and now I see videos
all the time that's like hey I'm going
through this I just watched Alexa
ballistic video about mental illness and
like it was just like I like I respected
her so much and I was like I wish that
when I was going through things
I would have watched other people's
YouTube videos and I also feel like the
other reason I want to make this is
because when you're going through
something like this you feel like no one
else in the world is going through
something like this
and that is really really weird to me
because now kind of like overcoming all
of this I see so many people go there
like a struggle with their
self-confidence and like going through
depression and stuff and you feel like
literally the only person in the entire
what it's the weirdest weirdest thing
and unless you've honestly gone through
it it's so hard to understand but you
wonder I think you're the only person
going through this so I'm making this
view to tell you guys you are not the
only one that has ever gone through this
and there are so many people in your
life probably not even just on the
internet or YouTube or anything there
are so many people in your life that
have probably struggled with this that
you never even knew but to start off so
I started YouTube when I was a freshman
I believe in high school so a little bit
before the freshman I think it was like
mid freshman year and my freshman year
was absolutely terrible for me it was
probably the worst year ever and um not
a lot of people know that because my
personality everyone is different but my
personality I don't know if I'm in focus
of kind of stress my personality is like
if I was going through something like if
I like stressed about like a decision I
have to make like I don't really talk
about it because I need to figure it out
on my own I don't go to other people for
advice normally so I think like going
through this no one else knew and a lot
of my close friends didn't know a lot of
even like my best friends so don't know
but like my freshman year was a very
very hard time in my life and probably
around 8th grade is when I started my
Instagram and I would post pictures all
the time I was so like unconfident in
myself and it sounds weird and this is
like a misconception that people have
about self-confidence which always
always irritates me is that people who
post Instagram pictures like if you put
a picture in a bathing suit and you like
are so hot people think like oh they
must be so confident and I is 100% not
the truth event and
I think looking at other people I always
thought like they have everything like
look at them so it's going to surround
like whatever but in reality that's
never how it really is it's never like
that I mean like yes now I post pictures
and feel confident I think you or
whatever but then I was still pictures
but I didn't think that I would
complicate it was just like mental and
so people are common on pictures and be
like you're so pretty and like there was
a voice and this is something that I
think that other people can relate to if
you are going through this there was
always a voice every time I would read a
comment it would be like you're so
pretty
I would like immediately be like they're
like like in my head it would just be
like they're lying to you that's not the
truth but they don't actually think
you're pretty like do you think you're
pretty like it was just a terrible
terrible voice in my head and it would
just constantly constantly bring me down
and so I would constantly upload
pictures of like selfies and like pics
should I take my backyard and be like
well one of these days like someone's
going to really mean it and people were
really meaning it but in my head I was
just like no they don't like I'm not
cute you know I'm like I sound so like
nonchalant about it now it is sad but
that's because I've like overcome this
and it doesn't matter to me anymore but
that probably was anyway I don't want to
make this too long but I did start a
YouTube channel my freshman year I was
going through a very very bad depression
and when I say depression is not even
I'm not trying to be like I'm just
another youtuber that's gone through
depression like it's I went through it
like depression is a thing it doesn't
matter who you are like it is something
that people go through it no matter who
you are there are people who
legitimately go through depression and I
feel like my freshman year I was very
honestly like I was depression I felt
very very lonely and that I was the only
one going through this and I was sad and
then the other thing with depression is
that when you are going through
depression you want to be more depressed
and that sounds weird and like this
sounds hard to explain but when you're
going through depression it's like you
don't want to get better you don't want
to be happy like once you're sad you're
just sad and you're just like I don't
care like someone can come if you good
what's wrong and you're like nothing
like you want to stay in that depression
and it's just
it's all mental like I don't know what
it is but going through that it was so
hard to get out of and so my whole
freshman year I basically went through
that and that is when I started my
YouTube channel and I posted videos for
a few months the end of my freshman year
and I got so much hate for them I
remember there were people who was like
bullying me it wasn't like oh my god
like loser like in my face it was just
like oh she's like our living YouTube
videos and all that kind of stuff and it
was really hard for me to handle one
because I was so unconfident and I was
already like very very sad so it was so
hard to constantly make youtube videos
when I just felt like everyone was like
bullying me enough to get me so I made
all the videos private source still
private you guys can't see them but I
just start up then and something I
definitely want to include in this video
is that over in the summer I went to a
church camp and I don't if you guys are
religious this doesn't really relate to
you but it is part of like my story and
I went to a church camp and I will never
ever forget this I told my mom did a
while ago but we were all in a small
group and I went by myself and there was
a girl in the small group and she was
talking and she was like I just want to
be like as confident as you Ketan like I
woke up to you so much and you make
videos and like all SS and she like went
on to say all these things that I did
not believe were true for me she went on
to tell me like that she just looked up
to me so much and she thought I was so
confident and like beautiful and like I
did not feel that way inside like she
probably doesn't even know she remembers
I don't know her name but I like did not
feel that inside but when she said that
to me I was just like people really
think this about me like there is really
someone out there who genuinely and now
it's like probably the first time it
ever really clicked with me that people
thought like I was like worth something
like this sounds so depressing but that
was probably the first time that I
really felt like someone genuinely liked
things that I am pretty and like I am
like doing something good by making
YouTube videos like that was the first
time I really felt like someone liked
what I was doing on YouTube my
relationship with God really really
strengthened over that summer and
I feel like what helped me like it was
just like one day I realized like I am
worthy of something and like I'm cute
like I'm going to make youtube videos I
don't care and I was like Keaton if you
start making YouTube videos you're not
stopping making YouTube videos because
like no like you already did it once and
you backed out because you're a chicken
and so I was like okay like I'm actually
going to do it this time so I start
making YouTube videos and I have made
YouTube videos ever since and that and
it's not something dramatic it's not
some crazy story where I went through
all this stuff there aren't different
aspects to it but I want to share with
you guys this about me because I feel
like sometimes it's just me coming on a
camera and being like let my favorite
products of the month are this and
here's argument hair and here's how I do
my makeup and it seems so unrealistic to
think that a youtuber you watch on a
daily basis could have gone through so
much of this and I felt that way when I
was watching the West Alessi's video I
was like reading the comments in there
like I never knew this and I'm like
people genuinely don't know that like
youtubers are just people like I am just
a person and like as much at like as
much fun as it is to talk about my
beauty products and all this like this
is also something that I have gone
through and I've really struggled with
self-confidence and I really really
struggled with depression and obviously
I haven't gone into depth I'm not
telling you guys all the aspects that I
feel like every day is a battle for me
and telling myself every day that like I
am I don't know why I'm getting
emotional I think I'm also on my period
guys so this might not be the best time
to film this video I'm getting a little
emotional but it is a battle everyday to
tell myself like you like dressed up we
get I'll just feel so gross and I'll
just be like I'm not uploading this like
oh my gosh like I'm not I can't put this
on Instagram I need to edit this but
it's at the end of the day it doesn't
matter because when I look back and see
what I come from and I come from really
like genuinely not loving myself is
genuinely going through a depression
where like I was not happy whatsoever
and no one knew until now like I
such a happy person like I'm crying but
I'm such a happy person now like I'm
genuinely I'm so happy and I'm so
blessed I'm like where I am and I am so
happy now I am so confident and I'm so
thankful for the community that I have
online and I'm so thankful for YouTube
and it's not because I have views and
it's not because this is like my job and
all that stuff I'm thankful because this
has given me so much more than just a
place to upload makeup videos this has
given me a place to really express
myself and I really found my self and my
self-confidence through this and it
helped me like it helped me so much to
get online and upload videos and how
people say like this is awesome like
that made me feel something and I am
uploading this because I want you guys
to know because I get so many
self-confidence questions I had so many
self-confidence and it's like how do you
feel so confident in this and I think
that it's kind of looking at my videos
it's like well she's always been like
that she's always just been like a
confident person she's always just
whatever and I haven't always been like
that I have had this struggle with me
and I want to upload this because I want
you guys to know that you are not the
only one because me going through
something I really did feel like I was
the only ones like I thought all my
friends were like perfectly fine and I
was like they think they're so cute and
like I and just like the ugly duckling
like I was just like I need to upload
something like this because I want you
guys to know that you're not the only
one who struggles with self-confidence
and you're not the only person who feels
less and if you wake up every day and no
one is telling you like you don't have
to YouTube like not everyone has a
YouTube channel they can go on and read
comments and it's like you're worthy
like if you don't have that like I want
you guys to know that like I care about
you guys so so much and when you guys
comment on my pictures and you're like
I'll never look like that like I want
you guys to know like you guys are
perfect like you guys are literally like
handmade by God and like he really
really values you guys and I understand
where you're coming from because I felt
like that like for me self-confidence
and depression kind of came hand-in-hand
but I do
would think that self calmness is such a
mental thing and it has nothing to do
with anyone else but yourself
self-confidence has nothing to do with
anyone else but yourself and like I
really strongly strongly believe that
because people think that like oh it
depends like well they think this about
me so now I'm not confident and that is
so so hard to understand that no one
else has any they don't have anything
and how you feel by yourself no one else
has any say on how you feel about
yourself I have purple hair now people
are probably like she's literally so
like I got a comment it was like you've
changed so much like now you have purple
hair and I was just like I feel great
like I feel great about myself my
confidence can not come from other
people because other people don't know
you other people don't know your life
they don't know what you wake up to on a
daily basis whether you have an amazing
amazing life they don't know whether you
have a terrible terrible life and you
feel so sad and you feel so lonely no
one knows what you're going through
except for you so you can't base your
self confidence in yourself work on
other people because people they don't
understand they don't understand you no
one is going to understand you so for
you to feel confident your self you
really need to take the time to search
for that in like your own like you
cannot base other people's opinions of
you and think well that's me like don't
identify yourself and other people and
it's so hard to do that
especially in today's society when it's
so much social media all the time and
constantly growing each other and I'm
like saying it's fatties and all the
stuff it's so hard not to compare those
people but like you just you just can't
like that is just I cannot live my life
constantly comparing because I will
never be someone else you're never going
to be someone else as much as I want to
be Kylie Jenner and I like want her life
like I'm never going to be here like the
matter of fact is I'm never going to be
here and so you just need to be happy
with your life as it is you're never
going to be someone else you're never
going to be in other people's shoes and
that is what you need to realize in
order to feel confident you need to be
confident with everything that you
already have I feel like I am rambling
now and I genuinely
wanted to make this video because you
guys are always commenting about
self-confidence and I really wanted to
touch on this video and talk from just a
very personal experience of mine because
it is something else regolith and I all
be free has not opened up about
everything that I went there just
because it's I don't feel like it's
necessary but I wanted you guys to know
that you are not alone if you are
feeling so low in your life and you are
feeling like you aren't loved or you
aren't worthy because I care about you
and I love you and you guys tweet me all
the time and it means so much to me and
I want you guys to know that I'm there
for you as well I really just wanted to
make this video because like every
single day I think about making this
video every single day I read comments
on my Instagram and I read you guys
tweets and I read you guys comment I'm
like I need people to understand that
they are not the only ones that have
ever felt this and I have found it too
and I'm here now and I am making YouTube
videos and I'm feeling great about
myself with this purple unicorn crazy
hair and I want you guys to know that
you guys can feel like this too because
when you're going through it you're like
no I can't like I'll never be that
confident never be like that and they've
want you guys to know that you can and
if you're ever struggling with anything
please just tweet me or message me or
something because I am here for you guys
and I this is something I like seriously
obviously feel strongly about I really
feel strongly about like self-confidence
and depression I want you guys always to
know that you guys can do anything no
matter how you feel about yourself and I
love you guys so so much I'm sorry that
this video was really really long I just
felt like I needed to address it if you
