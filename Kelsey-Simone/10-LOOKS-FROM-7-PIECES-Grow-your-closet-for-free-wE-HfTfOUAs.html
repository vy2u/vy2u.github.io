to be showing you 10 look that I created
from using only 7 clothing items I
wanted to teach you guys that you don't
have to have a huge wardrobe which
should be affectionate so you can
definitely restyle stuff so many times
so differently we have some stuff here
that are like essential pieces they're
really good for your ward you know you
can style them like a bajillion
different ways so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy the looks like I put together for
you and enjoy this little informational
lookbook so starting off with the first
outfit I'm using two of the 7 items I
have a blue denim pair of shorts which
pretty much go with everything and a
black button-up blouse button up blouses
can be worn so many different ways here
I'm just wearing it as a regular shirt
these are a must-have and an essential
for your wardrobe they're very easy and
inexpensive defined so it's easy to get
them in multiple different colors and
patterns without breaking the bank I
started off with a plain black one and
then this is a blue and white striped
one just sort of like those classic
beachy vibes that I love I also have a
white one that I'm going to put on as
well as a nude and white striped one
again these are so versatile I think I
show you either 3 or 4 different ways to
wear them in this book book the first
way is just button it up tuck it into a
cute pair of shorts like to keep the top
2 or 3 buttons unbuttoned and then wear
it with a couple chokers I threw up my
black and gold in furry slides on with
this just because it was super
comfortable and gave it a more casual
look on top of having a blouse which is
something that could easily be dressed
up or dressed down and I also paired my
either white or black bag with this they
kind of both went with every single
outfit but I love the way these look on
me you can either get them fitted or a
little bit oversized like this one that
I have here another great thing that you
can do it when they are oversized is you
have them off the shoulder or wear it
like a dress which is the second outfit
I did keep my shorts on underneath I
normally always do that when I have a
good t-shirt dress or a flow your dress
but this you can just button it all the
way let it loose if you have one that's
oversized I decided to put some chunkier
Brown sunglasses with this and then I
change into my white sneakers I had my
black bag with this outfit and this was
just such a comfortable casual look this
totally
give those fashionista but like on the
down-low vibes whether you're like at
the airport or getting brunch or I even
do this when I'm at the beach I bring
one of these to put as a cover-up over
my bathing suit it's amazing you can
either show a little bit of your shorts
like I did in this shot sometimes
they'll do that where I'll tuck it into
one pocket and it's really cute it kind
of shows like hey I am wearing pants you
know for the third look as well as the
third way to wear the blouse I put a
body con dress on and then I put the
white blouse either I had it off the
shoulder like this kind of like it was a
jacket or I tied it like a wrap top
which you could also tie it like a wrap
top with just pants as well but I have
this strapless black bodycon dress
underneath and I kept the sneakers on I
like the juxtapose of wearing sneakers
with like tight dresses I feel like it
just looks really cool it's a very easy
way to dress down address and also
strapless body con dresses are another
essential for the wardrobe I think I
wear this in like a couple other outfits
as well it's a great thing to have i
accessorized this with my white bag and
my tiny little black sunglasses I wear
these way too much you see these all
over my videos but like I was saying the
bandeau top bodycon dress can be worn a
lot of different ways and you're
probably like what it's a dress killa
see but I do sometimes tuck these into
my pants like this sort of as if it were
a bodysuit I styled this with my furry
white bucket hat which is my new lover
as well as my sunglasses black high
heels and my black bag and then I tuck
that into a pair of like really loose
fitted distressed jeans when you're
tucking address into pants it is good to
have like loose fitted jeans because
then you don't sort of see that bulk
people will just think it's a bodysuit
unless you tell them I do this trick all
the time and nobody knows but again
another thing that I've been loving
recently is the heels with the big baggy
jeans I think I said one of the Olsen
twins wear this and I've been obsessed
with the ever since I first did these
jeans and they already came with the cut
and there's some white paint splatter on
it too which is really cool on to the
fifth outfit I did the same tucking in
the body contract but I did it with my
denim blue shorts I also added a black
jacket just to sort of accessorize a
little bit because I felt it was looking
a little bit basic and then I kept my
white little Adidas sneakers with that
this is a super simple and classic
summer outfit that almost anybody can
recreate and then the sixth look is also
pretty simple as well I kept the same
look and just took
oversize little t-shirt threw that on
top an oversized t-shirt with some denim
shorts screams summer the shirt that I
have here is actually a Gotham City
University shirt which i think is the
coolest thing ever I first did this like
two days ago and I'm a completely in
love with it I paired this with my black
bag and I kept the little black shirt
underneath because when I tied it in a
knot I thought it just looked kind of
cool for the next outfit I just untucked
the shirt and just word as a t-shirt
dress this one personally was a little
small on me so I did keep my denim
shorts underneath obviously if I was
realistically going to wear a t-shirt
dress outfit I would not have picked
this year it was a little short but I
did pair that with my jacket again on
top with my free slides and my black bag
now for the eighth look you see how we
keep recycling all the same stuff and
literally using seven items to create
all these ten outfits I got back my
little mom jeans that I love so much
with my Gotham City t-shirt I tied that
in a little knot and I'm wearing my same
white sneakers I forgot to say I'm also
only using three pairs of shoes for all
ten outfits I could have easily just
worn these white sneakers with
everything because they pretty much went
with everything but this outfit was
definitely one of the most comfortable I
ended up wearing this later that day
when I was going out I kept on the jeans
and sneakers for the ninth outfit and
just changed out the t-shirt for a white
hoodie a white hoodies are the best any
hoodies are the best
I love hoodies I wear them way too much
even in the summer of course this book
right here is a little too hot for the
summer but I don't know maybe if it
rains maybe in the fall who knows this
look is cute I just have this basic
white hoodie I either just wore out
where I took it into the jeans which
looked a little bit more flattering on
my body look how cozy I look I was
feeling so snuggly I was so happy in
this outfit and then the last of the 10
that looks I kept the whole same thing
except I traded out the jeans for my
denim shorts again just white hoodie
denim shorts I put my size on with this
outfit but look how easy that was to
transform only 7 pieces into 10 outfits
