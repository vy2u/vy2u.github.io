you heard that correctly eight eight
dollars the second look is only thirty
nine dollars and that's the most
expensive one in this entire lookbook so
for today's video I decided to do a
lookbook of outfits that are completely
thrifted I wanted to show you guys that
you can still have that luxury fashion
used to look while still being on a
budget I hope all you guys get some good
thrift spiration and outfit inspiration
from this video and I hope you enjoy all
the looks that I put together for you
guys this first look is probably one of
my favorites starting off we have a pair
of mom jeans these are probably the
easiest thing to find at a thrift store
or a goodwill I just have a high-waisted
light wash pair you guys know I wear
light wash jeans like this all the time
which can tend to be pretty expensive
when they're the redone ones you can get
at Urban or online so thrifting them is
definitely a really good option for my
shirt I wore a white ribbed tank top
that I cropped and cut myself I tend to
DIY and modernize a lot of the pieces I
get when I go thrifting so it's
definitely a good thing to keep in mind
when shopping on what you could
potentially do to a piece for my bag I
wear this really adorable it's like this
black velvet little bag I don't even
know what shape or type to call it but
it was really cute and my grandma found
it for me actually and it was only a
dollar this necklace I'm wearing is a
gold and rhinestone cross necklace which
you guys know I have tons of those that
you can buy in stores and they're so
expensive but gold jewelry is something
I tend to find a lot when thrifting for
my jacket that I wore it is like a white
fur of course everything fur that's in
this video is fake fur but it's this
ribbed almost cropped jacket that I'm
really in love with you guys know that I
love furry jackets for the winter
especially to warm up a more summery
look like this I just think it's the
most amazing find I was so happy when I
found this it really ties the whole look
together and kind of gives it that
luxury more classic expensive look to
the outfit that you wouldn't even think
the entire outfit is from a third store
for the second outfit in this lookbook
we have another pair of mom jeans but
these are a black pair and then I also
have like a white silky lace tank top
and another little it's like a little
shoulder fur I've been obsessed with
wearing these lately I have a whole
collection of them in different colors
and prints that I've thrifted and then I
also have a bag to show you for the
outfit as well like I said mom jeans a
great thing to find
I have almost drifted all of mine these
are probably like my favorite fitting
ones they're really comfortable I like
the way that they fit me they're not too
big and not too small and I just sort of
have them rolled up at the bottom and
then for the tank top it is a white silk
tank top with lace detail on the front
which these in stores right now are so
expensive even online it's hard to find
these for less than $20 and I got this
for only $2.99 here's the bag that I
have which I'm actually obsessed with
it's like that tortoiseshell Brown print
but it's plastic and it's so nice I
literally I'm obsessed with this piece
and then the brown little shoulder for
that I have I also got for only $1
they actually connect to your jacket but
I just kind of like wearing it over my
shoulder and I just think it's such a
cute but casual look at the same time
again it's one of those things it looks
so well put together you look so stylish
and on-trend
nobody would ever guess how inexpensive
and how on budget this outfit is and
even though it does have that higher-end
feel it is something so simple that
everybody could wear and everybody could
look good in this I mean come on who
doesn't look good in a pair of black
jeans with a cute little white top it's
all in the way you style stuff the way
that you rock it the way that you wear
it the confidence you have when you wear
it that really pulls it together and
brings the look to a whole entire
another level for the third look this is
a piece we've had in our house for such
a long time my mom thrifted this when I
was like a really little kid and finally
now that I've grown up I've gotten into
these two-piece sets it was a little bit
big on me so I have this cool idea to
sort of tie the pants at my waist with
this sort of belt it's actually I think
a necktie but it's this black velvet
sort of thing I used as a belt which
really gave this cool cinching look to
the pant and then it has the matching
jacket that I just sort of hung over my
shoulder and then I paired that with a
white again I cut it myself little
cropped t-shirt I thought it would be
best to pair it with a more simple shirt
on top since the two-piece set has such
a bold print I didn't want to distract
or take away from it so I just thought a
plain cropped white t-shirt would look
great when you're thrifting at the
thrift store sometimes you will see
items that may not be exactly your size
but definitely something fun to do is
play around with that in these pants I
I'd really like but they were really
really I think they're honestly like six
times my size um but I just sort of took
that little belt and since should around
my waist and it looks really really cool
it definitely gives that more high-end
flare because this isn't something you'd
see every single day but I definitely I
love it and I think it's really really
cool for the next outfit in this
lookbook I really really love it if it
looks a little familiar and may or mind
you of something that I wore on my
Instagram but this is the thrifted
versions maybe like four times less than
the original outfit sprays so I have
these nude pants they're cinched around
the waist they have pockets they're
flowy and they're super comfortable they
feel like pajama pants I'm in love with
them I actually was lucky enough to find
the same exact pair in the thrift store
in three different colors so these are
the nude ones that I got and then the
top was something my mom picked up for
me it's this polka dot sort of off the
shoulder ruched puffy shirt which these
are all the rage right now stores are
selling these tons of designers are
making shirts like this and I thrifted
mine and then I have this little bag it
sort of looks like a little Chanel sort
of feel bag it has this gold chain it's
got gold detail on it and it's white and
has this shiny patent leather sort of
look to it and I love it it's the
perfect size I love this look of bag it
looks sort of like a vintage designer
bag which is I'm I'm all about that and
I thought it just went perfectly with
the outfit tied it together and it's a
super cute but really comfortable look
the next outfit I'm really really hype
about because I saw my Instagram this
picture of an outfit I've been wanting
to recreate for so long I saw a girl
wearing this long silky white flowy
dress with a sweater on top of it and I
never would have thought to put a
sweater on top of my dress until I saw
it and I was like I want to do that so
I've been looking for a white silk dress
that's long for so long and I couldn't
find them anywhere until I finally went
to the thrift store and I found one for
$2.99 and like why did I not think about
doing that before and then I also
thrifted this sweater for three dollars
it is this super chunky knit sweater I'm
in love with it's got sort of like a
turtleneck to it and it's really really
comfortable again I have one of those
little shoulder furs it's got this
cheetah print on it and then
just paired that with a pair of more
grungy er boots I feel like with a super
girly outfit like this I would want to
wear it with a more grungy or shoe say
if you have Doc Martens or any sort of
black combat boot or leather shoe that
would be really cool but I really love
this trend of the sweater on top of the
super long dress I hope it catches on
because I think it's so cool and
comfortable and a really really smart
way to warm up a summery dress for the
winter time if you still want to rock in
wear it just throw a cool sweater over
top of it and there you go the last
outfit in this lookbook is the more
casual one I have a pair of light wash
cutoff shorts these are actual vintage
Levi's shorts and I didn't have to cut
these myself I found them like this all
distressed and beautiful in their form I
was so happy I wear that with a black
leather this is like a fanny pack or
waist bag whatever you want to call it
I've been obsessed with the fanny pack
trend I used to hate it but I'm just
obsessed with it now and then I wear
this zip up gray and white hoodie and I
weren't off the shoulder I saw some
people doing this and I thought it was
really really interesting I was like hey
let me try that out and I really really
liked it I think it's really cool and
yeah I have a pair of little mini
vintage sunglasses because you know I
wear those all the time and I got these
for only $1 which is a really great
steal I feel like a really extra mom
from the early 2000s taking her kids to
the amusement park in this look those
are those are just the vibes I get um
but yeah I hope you liked these lugs I
