shining it's a really bright low by
myself outfits today I'm trying to go
for like that summery vibe today because
you guys know I love the summer and I
hate the cold and it's actually like the
sun is shining today and it's warm
enough that I don't need a jacket which
makes me the happiest person in the
world right now I'm getting in the car
we're gonna go to two places first place
we're gonna go to is the health food
store because I know it sounds weird but
if you guys know me you know that I
don't commonly like I don't have like a
diet I don't eat very healthy at all
like I'll admit that I don't eat healthy
at all so I thought it would be a good
idea to buy some vitamins so I take like
a daily multivitamin but I feel like
that's not enough I wanted to get like a
couple random vitamins so I thought I
have a health food store literally down
the street from where I live so I'm
gonna go there we're gonna pick up some
stuff I did some research on what I
should get and then also we're gonna go
to Dunkin Donuts just because I want
some breakfast haven't eaten breakfast
yet we're gonna get some hashbrowns and
iced coffee because their patterns are
freakin best okay so this is what I got
I have these are my vitamin C gummies
and then I found the B vitamins that I
needed these are the ones for giving you
lots of energy and then I got this which
is college and beauty water it's like a
protein powder with like tons of good
stuff in it for your skin and your nails
so let's go let's go we're gonna get our
eye popping Wow I love how right after I
leave the health food start like let's
go to Dunkin Donuts and get hash browns
okay I just had a very fun um experience
um my keys got locked in the ignition so
I had to call my dad to figure out how
to get it out but we're back in action
I also picked up hashbrowns so the bomb
calm we're home now Wow we're gonna go
we're gonna eat I have a couple of
packages to show you I got some stuff in
the mail I thought I'd open them for you
guys
the first thing actually is a package
from shadow Hill
they sent me a couple of honey's so I
picked them all out and when I picked
this one out I didn't actually know that
it was a zip up Hoodie but I'm really
excited that it is because I don't have
any and I've been wanting one I've got
some wording on the hoods they print on
champion hoodies which I think that's
really cool I like it it says shadow
Hill here doesn't have anything on the
back of this one but it's like burgundy
and like I said it like zips then they
sent me this one which is just a long
sleeve sort of crewneck shirt it says
shadow Hill USA on the sleeves and then
this one this is like their classic sort
of print with the like shadow Hill on
the back it says Los Angeles USA it's
got a little palm tree and then on the
front it says shadow Hill and it's like
this really nice mango color so this one
is just like a black hoodie
and it has its it says emergency warning
on the front and then it says shadow
Hill down the side and then on the back
it has like an emergency warning I think
that it's pretty cool I think it's
different I really like it this one says
that it's from glam glow okay I think
this is the one I see all over Instagram
it's like the one with the glitter in it
do you see that really hoping this like
blows me away let's let's see look how
cool that is what what smells really
good too can you see that there's a lot
of glitter in here I like that they
advertise it like exactly how the
product is cuz I expected like oh it
looks that cool watch there'd be like
five pieces of glitter in the bottle but
this has a lot of glitter in it oh she's
so cute hi as you can see my mom just
facetimed me she's going to be Jays now
