channel and also we'll come back to this
video I've done many times before but
you guys love them I mean I love them we
all love them I am doing a super
affordable fashion clothing haul plus a
lookbook you guys know I love that
beachy summery vibe I'm addicted to it I
can't get enough of it so I literally
traveled all the way out to Miami just
to film this lookbook because I wanted
it to look super beachy I do things for
the aesthetic I go the limit you
probably already guessed it today's
video is in partnership with zaple I
love them I've done so many videos with
them you guys love when I do videos with
that I picked out some stuff from their
site it's very summery perfect for the
summer I know you guys are gonna love it
also example is having their fourth year
anniversary carnival June 8th through
25th so definitely make sure to check
out Zappos links I'll leave every link
in the description as well as all the
links for everything that I'm talking
about here I think I'm just gonna start
I'm gonna dive right into it I guess the
first thing I'll start off with is what
I'm living right now is this black and
white plaid shorts and just crop top set
it's like an off-the-shoulder
long-sleeve shirt it's very flowy and
like super thin a comfortable area
fabric so don't worry you won't be hot
in this at all I'm actually wearing the
shorts right now but they're very
high-waisted which I like and they have
this long flowy tie that wraps around
the front and it's very common so
comfortable oh my god I like that it's
very put together where you could just
wear this out during the day and go
shopping to go to lunch whatever but it
also makes a perfect Beach cover-up
which I actually have another set that I
was wearing as a beach cover-up when I
was in Miami
again a very flowy comfortable it's
almost like a pajama set it's so
comfortable
just this cotton very breathable fabric
this is just this it may be blue and
white stripes so it's very nautical I
love it it has ties from the front of
the shorts and then
has a little cropped t-shirt that sort
of has like a little v-neck on it you
guys know I'm so obsessed with matching
sets so I had to get some matching sets
they're very easy to just sort of throw
on you don't have to put too much effort
into your outfit but it looks like you
did because you look super put together
and look super stylish sappal has so
many matching sets I had to hold myself
back from buying too many of them they
have so many so depending on you know
what you sort of like print wise and
they have tons that are amazing next
thing that I got was this red and white
pinstripe button up top and I know what
you're thinking Kelsey you have so many
of those why do you need another one
this one fits definitely a lot
differently it has this belt and it's
very oversized sort of like a dress so
then you can cinch it around your waist
I love the way it looks again it's a
very thin flowy fabric so it sort of
just like flows all the way down i
styled this with a pair of white denim
shorts underneath just to give me like a
little bit of coverage but again you
could just throw this on top of your
bathing suit and you're good to go so
this is very perfect for that and I love
the just sort of red and white stripe I
actually have a couple of red pieces in
this lookbook I'm just super attracted
to that color right now I don't know why
these are the white shorts that I wore
it with their super distressed and
frayed at the bottom which I love
distressed shorts so much more than
rolled shorts or how much I just love
the distress they're very very high
waisted they have a stretchy sort of
denim so they're super comfortable to
wear and I honestly don't have like a
lot of white denim especially when it
comes to shorts I don't have like any
white denim shorts so I think they look
good in the summer and they go with like
most of my little summery tops and stuff
like that so these were just a really
good thing to pick up then I got this
gorgeous super long flowy red and white
polka dot dress I love this dress it's
so flattering it looks so pretty on and
I don't know what it is about going to
the beach and having a long flowy dress
it's so beautiful especially for taking
pictures and it just you can twirl in it
and it flows in the wind and it's
amazing so it has this sort of
straight-across neckline that I love
I've so many tops like this I love them
it's spaghetti strap and then it just
goes all the way down and the best part
about it is it has pockets do you know
home is
it's to have address the pockets you
don't even know it's two pockets on both
sides which is so amazing it has this
scrunchy material and kind of like this
top right here so it's very fitted at
the top which I like and then it just
sort of flows out and goes all the way
down to of my ankles I've got this
little stretchy banjo crop top right
here I think these are like the number
one summer go to top eyewear it's just
these little stretchy bando tops they're
so easy to style you throw them on with
a pair of shorts and some chokers and
you look so cute I really wanted a
leopard one just because I love leopard
for the summer I even talked about that
in one of my recent trend alerts I've
been obsessed with leopard print it has
sort of frills at the top and the bottom
of the shirt which I like that a little
detail I styled them with this pair of
jeans right here these jeans are like a
medium sort of wash denim and they're
sort of not really flared at the bottom
but they're not tight like skinny jeans
either and they have all of this just
stressed ruffling which i think is such
a cool detail I don't really have again
a lot of jeans like that they have like
this overlaying like almost like it's 2
pairs of jeans I think it's it's just
like a super cool design and I honestly
wear jeans so much to the beach
especially like at night time or if
you're going out to dinner sort of by
the water and you need a really cute
pair of jeans that these are so nice
they're high-waisted and they fit really
nice and I just think they look really
cute with this little scrunchie bandeau
top also but I also had it styled with
this little sweatshirt right here when I
saw this online I was like I have to get
that that's so cool so it's like a white
long sleeve sweatshirt but it has this
really cool interesting sort of cutout
at the bottom I've never seen anything
like that before I think it's perfect
you couldn't even with this shirt I have
on right now it can sort of go over any
little top that you have whether it's a
bathing suit or just any sort of like
this exactly like this bandeau top it
just shows a little bit of it underneath
and it's really cool for layering when
it's like a little chilly or like I said
if it's like
tonight I always sort of bring a
sweatshirt with me when I go to the
beach anyways because I sort of expect
that especially in the beginning of the
summer because you know there's a cool
breeze and sometimes you just need a
little sweater to stay cozy then I also
picked up this top right here which you
know me and my silk I love little silk
flowy pieces so this is like a red sort
of cowl-neck tank top Cadillacs are
super trendy and popular right now and I
really wanted to get one so I got this
red silk you want it does coming out of
their colors as well and then the last
thing for clothing and then we'll move
on to like my shoes bags and accessories
is this dress right here it is a plaid
it's got like black and white sort of
print but then it's also got these
little red stripes in it it's an
off-the-shoulder but then it has little
straps on it which is really cool too
it's got a ruffle at the top and then it
just sort of flows down into like the
rest of the dress but then it also comes
with a little belt so you can cinch it
around the waist because it looks so
much more flattering that way and I like
the little detail of the matching fabric
belt I think that's really cute
I love the ruffles at the top of the
dress I think that that's so pretty down
towards your wrist
it's crunches here so it's like got a
little ruffle which i think is really
cool because then it ties in with the
ruffle on the top and I mean it is just
such an essential for your wardrobe to
have like a perfect little summer dress
it's just such a necessity to happen at
the summer time and that will has so
many good little summer dresses with
that dress I wore this bag right here it
is this black leather sort of bucket
shaped bag it's got this really cool
gold and pearl detail buckle on the
front which I've been getting into
pearls a lot lately too I have never in
my life been into pearls but I recently
started wearing some stuff with pearls
on it and this one is just really really
roomy so it's got like a lot of room in
there perfect for just like a little
beach bag when you through your
headphones some touch up stuff little
bit of sun block and you're perfect
you're good to go and then my second bag
you guessed it it's a black leather and
gold bag Wow
it's just honestly black leather and
gold is just my favorite combo for
purses this is like what all my purses
look like but this again it has like a
gold buckle on the front
is really cool and then it's got these
little gold sides this guide is more of
like a structured shape which is
honestly personally just how I like my
bags to be so I do love this one a lot
and they just go with all of my outfits
these bags go with every single outfit
that I have here honestly would this be
as Apple haul if I didn't have cool
sunglasses just a summer haul in general
would it be a summer haul if I didn't
have cool sunglasses you guys know I
have a big sunglass collection I love
sunglasses and Zach will just has some
really cool shades these ones that have
just like really skinny sides they're
all black with like these little square
lenses that are really cool and then I
also picked up two pairs of earrings
I've really been getting into like
statement earrings I mean I've always
loved earrings but I've been getting
into like really big statement earrings
I got these ones which I wore with the
red long dress they're like this
tortoiseshell beam shape I don't really
know how to describe this shape it just
looks like a beam to me but I think
they're really cool they're so pretty
and I already love like the whole
tortoise shell whether it's like on my
sunglasses or whatever it may be so I
think the earrings are just really cool
and then I also got these big gold ones
they're sort of like this gold crescent
shape and they just sort of dangle down
and they're really really pretty to
layer especially like other little
earrings I love these and then of course
I got this gold a little necklace I love
layering necklaces in the summer it's
got these sparkly little cream colored
beads right in the front which is like a
cute little detail and then it's just
gold so it just dangles down and this is
one of those necklaces that are perfect
for layering it's not really a statement
necklace where it's gonna be like way
too much going on you know it's just a
little simple chain that you can layer
with like a couple other little pretty
ones and it looks perfect
these shoes I can always talk about
these these are so so cute I honestly
wear white sneakers
more than I wear sandals and flip-flops
in the summer like white little kid
seekers or my go-to shoe they go with
everything even now I just wear them all
the time so I picked up these they have
these leopard print laces which are the
coolest thing ever and then they have
this gold metallic tongue which is
really cool and then they're like furry
on the inside so they're comfortable and
they also have this red suede star and
then this
way back as well and then they Dupree
already come like this they come very
distressed with like this shading on it
which I think it's just a really cool
look so sadly so so sadly that is it
that is everything that I have for
today's haul but I hope you guys enjoyed
