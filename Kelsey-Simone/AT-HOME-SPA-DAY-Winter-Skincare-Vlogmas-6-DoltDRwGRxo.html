just brought me some breakfast they just
brought me some breakfast from a cafe
that's like near our house that I really
like so I got like an omelet with like
spinach tomatoes onions cheese then it
comes with potatoes I got them to bring
me an iced coffee and I'm watching Teen
Titans cuz no shame also look how pretty
these flowers are I got my mom these
when I went to the grocery store like a
couple days ago I was like let's just
sort of relax and let's do like a little
spa day I haven't given myself like a
nice facial in a while I have like
proper skincare videos on my channel if
you guys want to see like a legit
skincare routine I do have those on my
channel but basically just gonna eat my
breakfast I'll see you in a little bit
it's noon right now I'm probably going
to film the rest of the video that I
filmed yesterday like film the other
segments that I didn't get to film and
then I'll upload all of that and I'll
probably wait to edit it tonight after I
do my facial so I'll be like all relaxed
from my spa and then I can edit right
now I'm doing my daily devotion but it's
so funny okay so I just wanted to share
a very it's very small but I thought it
was funny to share with you guys so I
was having like a little worship session
over here right doing my thing and I was
listening to sinking deep I was like I
should put on come to me from Bethel
like I'm just feeling really led to sing
that song right now so I put it on and I
was just like you know praise the Lord
dude my thing and so I go on my Joyce
Meyers daily devotion I'm really out of
time sequence so it's not the one that's
actually for today it literally I open
up the devotion and it goes he is saying
come to me that's like the first thing
and then so I read it and I was like oh
my god god is so good haha boy and then
I open up my scripture for the day and
it's James 4:8 come close to God and he
will come close to you I thought that
that was just so funny that they all
went together I will link the daily
devotional that I use in the description
below I want to show you guys this whole
look super badly but I can't yet so
right now I'm in the process of
finishing filming the video that I
started filming yesterday so you guys
will see the rest of this like this
whole look on my Instagram it's raining
today so we can't take Instagram
pictures so we're gonna do that tomorrow
we're gonna go down to like this really
nice boat dock and like take pictures
but I love this hat it's from lack of
color this little rhinestone star
necklace is from Adina's so I finally
just got done filming
I'm really tired that took so much
longer than I expected it to I'm gonna
put my hair up and I'm gonna take off
all this jewelry and then I'm going to
start by removing my makeup I like using
coconut oil I feel like it just removes
my makeup the fastest and easiest and
because it's coconut oil obviously it's
really hydrating for my skin I kinda
just like warm it up in my fingers I
gotta take a nice chunk so once you get
it nice and nice and melted you just
just go in there just rub it all on I
don't know if I can look at you and you
can see it gets it off really quickly so
the next thing I'm gonna do oh I'm gonna
actually clean my face go ahead well
recently sent me these two cleansers
that I've been liking they were both
like I don't know just kind of cool this
one I personally like the best this one
is there hydrating jelly bomb cleanser
so it's like black and glittery which is
it has like a weird texture it's like
snail slimy goo if that mate feels
really cool on your face and I like that
I can open it but yeah I think this
one's really cool um I think this one's
really cool and it smells so good
and then this one that they send me is
their clear and cream to foam cleanser
this one also has a really cool texture
and it's super thick like it's like a
clay mask if you can see that I really
like both of that I think I'm going to
use this one right now though and then I
also use this which is like a little
charcoal brush thing to like clean my
face and just kind of apply it to my
face like this almost like it's a mask
it smells really good it smells like
super minty my parents went out to
dinner so my mom texted me the menus
that I could order something she
literally just texted me the menu so
your girls getting rigatoni brought home
by the way I just washed all of that off
next thing I'm gonna do is tone my face
I have no clue or my favorite toner went
you know like the spray rose want to
talk to my
or fresh new cooler but but they gave me
another toner they gave me their peony
brightening and moisturizing facial
toner I normally tone after I exfoliate
but I kind of forgot so we're gonna do
it a little bit out of order I'm trying
to use like different products than what
I'd normally use just to like show you
guys some new stuff so many products
though I'm gonna use this this isn't
technically like an exfoliator but it is
like an exfoliating treatment so this is
from I don't know if but borer is how
you would say it or like if you need
like a cool accent but we're just going
with before it's a sugar oil peel I
don't know if you can see but there's
like little like shards it's almost like
shards of glass it feels like in this
thing and there's no directions on it so
I'm not sure if it's like a treatment
where you like leave it on your skin for
a certain amount of time or you just
like apply like this like rub and then
wash it off but that's how I use it
because it feels like just a rough
physical exfoliant so that's just how I
use it but I could be wrong it actually
kind of tastes good too Wow okay um so
that my skin um next what I'm gonna do
is we're going to moisturize I keep them
in a little Club Monaco bag but it's
just like these face oil treatments
these are also from the board there's
two types there's this like big clear
one and then I have like a bajillion of
these mini yellow ones the yellow ones
are glow Buster's and then these big
clear ones are stress fluid I think the
container is cool it's in this glass
bottle so it has this little thing that
you like you put tissue around it and
you snap the top of the bottle off let's
see I've used this one before I've only
used it once I've used the globe
boosters a bunch I really like those
ones so give you a close-up next I'm
gonna put on some good old I cream you
have the Dior prestige Ike rhenium I'm
just gonna dab a little bit with my ring
finger and then we're gonna do in my
lips we have some Frank body lip stuff
they sent me a package of stuff I
I love Frank body so this is their lip
scrub and then this is their just their
regular lip balm so I'm gonna do that
next we have the balm and I just apply
that with my fingers okay there we go
and we're done do you want to see how
crazy I am for that whole scene I put a
softbox in my tub I did right now I am
editing the video that I filmed
yesterday and then the other half of it
today so I'm gonna edit this and then
I'm probably gonna eat dinner when my
parents come home cuz I'm starving and
then I'm gonna go to bed I hope you guys
