I would do like a little broom haul yeah
Ruhal my aesthetic has been changing a
little bit I know crazy you're used to
seeing it being like completely black
and white I've been adding wood into my
room I know that's weird I never would
have thought I said that you'll see I'll
show you it's really nice it's like a
light wash wood it's really pretty sort
of good need beachy guys I feel like
that's why I like it I don't know but
just sort of like light Browns neutral
tone gold okay so yeah what are you
gonna start with I'm going to start with
the wood stuff I think you guys are
already like questioning that so the
first thing that I got that I really
love I have a couple of this it's like
marble and wood NIC it gives me like I
said like beachy vibe
I like whitewash wood as well but like
this lighter toned wood I don't really
look like dark rustic looking wood but
like this basically this is how I would
describe it and the next piece is like
the same it's from the same collection I
got these at HomeGoods pretty much 80%
of the stuff is going to be from home
goods they're my Holy Grail for room
stuff I just put all my makeup brushes
in it for now it was like ten dollars
and then the other piece that I have is
this it's like a bracelet rack but it's
from the same collection I love having
both because you guys already know that
like I love marble in my room I think it
looks really classy it looks polished
nice pretty but been like having the
woods mixed with it I don't know I like
it I don't know if it's just like a
phase I'm going through right now and
then also I just picked this up you
could see yourself there's my camera
it's like a little hand mirror I don't
really own any of you so I thought might
as well I don't have one let's get one
it was $2.00 at IKEA which is really
cool I found it in the mirror section
and I really liked it but yeah I just
thought was really pretty I just sort of
have it sitting on my vanity right now
and it just does its thing it looks
adorable in the corner I haven't really
used it yet I bought it yesterday though
so that's okay and then I picked up this
at IKEA as well
doesn't it look just like my pinstripe
button-up shirt I wear all the time I
know I got inspired by this picture on
my Bihar dance girl had her all white
bedding with like a pinstripe blanket
and her tan legs and it looked so pretty
I was like if That's not me
I need a pig striped blanket so I was
already in IKEA when I saw the picture
so I like ran down to the bedding and I
was like I have to find this and luckily
enough they had one and I like this is
like it's such a muted navy blue you can
barely tell it's blue it looks gray
doesn't it which I like that because I
don't really like having blue in my room
you know me so it's a duvet cover which
basically just means you put another
blanket inside of it so it's like a
cover and then it comes with two
pillowcases this I picked up at
HomeGoods as well it's like those furs
that you see everywhere like IKEA has
like the white one but this one's just
sort of like got these darker parts and
they had to click white fur but like the
tips of the fur or black which is really
cool I like the texture it gives I like
the way it looks if I have like an
all-white bed like this where it just it
needs a pop of something I'll just throw
that right on top and see it just adds
texture and makes the background look a
lot nicer
these are super bold they're kind of
heavy but I have these there's three of
them inside each other but I'll try to
take it off I have these acrylic boxes I
think they're supposed to be like shoe
boxes I don't know I also got these at
home goods
there's like a small a medium and a
large one yeah I think they're super
cool I don't know exactly what I'm going
to put in them yet and then I also got
this which is a necklace holder this was
20 bucks I still can't get the sticker
off of it but yeah I just sort of hang
three or four pretty ones on here just
for display it doesn't really do that
much purpose of organizing could it look
really pretty on my dresser Oh candles
everybody everybody loves candles I got
two new candles first I got this one
it's just like this really nice rose
candle I love rose such things you guys
already know this but I like that it has
like a black outer case because all of
the candles are white so I thought that
this would look nice a little bit of a
difference I have this one this is from
the brand pecs
Texas England and I've never had their
candles before but I have their room
spray oh just like the liquidy sprays
for a rounded room but I found the exact
same scent in the same brand with a
candle and it smells exactly the same
and I'm so happy about it I'm getting
way too hype over a candle it's just
wild Bluebell and jasmine like that just
okay it's florally but no it smells like
this candle will make your life so much
better it smells so good really highly
recommend if you know where to get these
candles these are super cute I got these
two new books these are actually I do
actually use them they're not just for
decoration purposes it's like this
glossy obviously it's fake it's not real
what is this crocodile not real it's a
book it was like three dollars I just
write like video ideas down in this I
have the worst handwriting ever and then
I also have been using this it says 2018
so this is like updated but I can
already use it now because it starts in
August of 2017 which is really good it
just sort of looks like this so it has
every day individually so I can just
write down what I'm doing in this day
which is really good then I have this
this definitely gives me beachy vibes I
mean obviously it's sea coral but I
really really wanted like something
oceany in my room so I got this little
white coral really pretty it's almost
like acrylic thing again I still haven't
taken the sticker off of it I tried to
but I think this is like only 10 bucks I
got it on sale which is really nice I
don't really know where to put it yet I
have it over there on top of my makeup
organizer but obviously it's not going
to stay there okay after this I don't
have more thing left but I picked up
this white tray gorgeous I love trays I
don't know what it is I have like 50
billion trays I'm always tells me don't
need more train but I do I need things
to put things in I don't have just a
plain white tray and this would have
like a go off the finish which I really
like so again I don't really know what
I'm going to put in this yet right now
it's on top of my makeup organizer and
was dropped okay we have two more things
left at first when I bought it I didn't
really know what it was which is so
stupid Kelsie why would you buy
something in don't know
I know I know but now that I brought in
at home I figured out it's a nail polish
rack that's what it is but it don't have
that many nail polishes I gave like all
menea polishes away because I never do
my own nails so what's the point of me
having this if I don't use it so I gave
them all away so yeah I love the glass
and white combination it was only 25
bucks at HomeGoods great deal we'll
figure out what to do with it though
don't worry we'll figure it out okay
this last piece is kind of too big to
get in the frame obviously you'll see
better in the Tryon section but I have
this really big spinny gorgeous white
fur chair that I love this is the most
comfortable chair I think I've ever had
in my entire life since I have a new
desk in my room I figured obviously I
need a new desk chair because before I
just have like a little stool which is
very uncomfortable to sit on for hours
if I'm editing or do my makeup oh okay
that is it
