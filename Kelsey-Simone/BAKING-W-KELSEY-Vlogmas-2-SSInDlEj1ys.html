everybody and welcome back to another
episode of me freezing to death so I
hope your day has been holly-jolly and
if it hasn't yet it's going to be now
because we're making Christmas cookies
during yesterday's vlog myths if you
haven't seen it I highly recommend you
check it out I went like room shopping
we decorated mini little room tour but
when I was at Marshall's I picked up
this which is like a little like pre
measured out cookie mix which I've never
used these before so I guess we'll like
see how it goes this is a triple
chocolate elf treats but there's nothing
like crisps and see about it besides the
jar so I have these I just like phantom
I have a snowman shape a gingerbread
dude shape and then a little star this
isn't like Christmassy but like I
thought it kind of was okay so we need
butter we need an egg we need vanilla
and we need water one and a half sticks
one another one and we'll just cut it we
only have three left but we only need
one and then we need we need vanilla
okay and then we need water obviously
got it and then we need that's it so now
we're going to put this in we have our
little mixing bowl a whisk also I did
forget that I wanted to jam out to some
Christmas music okay so next we need 1
teaspoon of vanilla
so if I have to butter the egg in the
vanilla you kind of can't see it but now
we need that's it okay so add this and
then we mix it all together I can't
there we go got it and we pour all of
this in break it up a little bit so
today just kind of like a chill day I
don't really have much plan like I said
I'm probably not even leaving the house
today but tomorrow is gonna be really
fun I'm going out with a friend we're
going this place it's like a mansion
turns into like an indoor garden and
there's gonna be like a Christmas light
show we're gonna lunch so that's why I'm
doing tomorrow which is kind of exciting
I feel like I've only done like four
cooking with Kelsey's ever and like
three of them have been me baking
cookies it's now gonna mix all of this
together oh yeah okay
what else will be good that would be
that'll need that that'll be fine it'll
be okay
this is actually really hard oh I'm
supposed to have water it's like
I love Michael Buble so I think this is
good this is about the dough yes it's
gonna get my hand hurts I'm so good
thing now I'm gonna get my cookie sheet
and I'm gonna put parchment paper on it
and then we're gonna form this into
dough and use the cookie cutters oh my
god I am such a professional I'm really
proud of myself oh wow that was
satisfying
look at that look how perfect that is
okay so I just cleaned up the kitchen
and the cookies are still baking they
only have like two more minutes left so
I wanted to like watch a movie and I
feel like I should be watching a
Christmas movie but I don't know I only
