be doing a holiday beauty lookbook for
you guys with the help of some of my
favorite products from colour-pop so for
the first look I'm gonna be starting off
with highlighter I love this highlighter
I literally use it on like a daily basis
this is in the shade stole the show and
I'm going to be applying this all over
on my cheekbones on my Cupid's bow on
the tip of my nose any place that you
want to look super glowy and dewy and
sparkly now for my eyebrows I have one
done just to show you guys an example
but I'm gonna be using my color pop brow
pencil this brow pencil has a super
duper fine tip so it's perfect to create
sort of like a natural just hair like
stroke fill them in whatever way you'd
like just get them looking super groomed
and super pretty
you
now for the lip color which totally
pulls the whole look together I'm going
to be using my colour-pop lippie stick
in the shade chateau this is a super
dark red which I love for the holidays I
pretty much wear to every holiday party
is this sort of red wine lip color and
this lipstick isn't a matte but it's not
a gloss either it has a super velvety
look to it I'm obsessed
now onto the second look the first thing
we're going to do is use this color pop
sculpting stick in the shade bloom and
we're going to get a super sharp contour
and make our face super bronzy I love
the sculpting stick because it gets your
contour exactly where you want it and it
looks super sharp and I just look at
that I love it so after that we're going
to move on to the eyes and I'm going to
be using three different color pop
eyeshadows which their eyeshadows are
honestly my favorite I'm going to be
taking these two golden tones one is in
supermodel and then the other one is in
Sunset Boulevard and then moaning is
another shade that we're going to be
using for our bottom lash line but
starting with the two golden colors I
use my finger at first but I decided it
was better to use a brush I just sort of
mixed them together to create this
perfect golden a champagne
sparkly color to put all over my lid and
then use mooning on my bottom lash line
to just add some depth make it a little
smoky I love this look it's simple but
you also look glam enough for a holiday
party so onto the lips I'm using another
lippy stick this one is in the shade
pillow-talk this is just a super dark
matte nude which you guys know I love
dark matte nude colors I thought that
this color matched perfectly with the
look plus since at the darker tone noon
it goes perfect with the fall holiday
look
on to the third look which is totally
screams holiday glam festive party I'm
going to be starting with highlighter
again to get that super holiday glow I'm
using this color pop highlighter in the
shade Candyman I'm going to be using a
fan brush and putting this all over my
face to get a super dewy glowy look and
then I'm going to be using a colourpop
lip liner and this is just a nude lip
liner to help prepare for the lipstick
and for my lip color I'm using another
lippy stick and this one's in the shade
Hollywood Boulevard this is just sort of
like a more red toned Orange Ebert nude
I don't know how to describe it but it's
a really beautiful color and I love this
this one's also on the matte side but
they're not super drying I love that
about them so I thought that this one
went perfectly with the look and I just
I just love the way that it came out
my hair
not
just one thing
you're not here with me get it time
y'all
now for the last look of the lookbook
I'm going to start off with just a
normal natural face and I'm going to be
taking these three shades from
colour-pop starting off with white
rabbit I'm also going to be using
Central Perk and Static this is a super
just burnt orange e rusty shimmery just
perfect I'm obsessed with this color so
I'm going to pack this all over my lid
just these are super pigmented so you
don't even need that much like look how
pigmented they are but I'm just going to
put this all over my lid right up until
where my crease starts look how
beautiful then I'm going to take Central
Park which was the darkest of the three
colors and I'm going to be just fluffing
that in my crease with a round brush
just sort of blending back and forth
with windshield wiper motions just
getting that super smoky look and then
taking static and putting that on my
bottom lash line and just blending that
all out to create this perfect just sort
of a warm toned smoky eye with the red
I'm just I'm so obsessed with this look
and for the lips since the eyes were so
bold I decided to just take this
colour-pop ultra matte lip color and
this one is in the shade Times Square
it's just this really really pretty nude
color this is going to dry into a matte
and I decided to be extra and go all out
I took this highlighter from colour-pop
which is in the color wisp this is my
favorite of all their highlighter colors
by the way I took this on my middle
finger and just pop that on the center
of my lips and blended it out with my
finger to create this sort of ombre
glittery lip look I love this for a
holiday party I think it's so cool I
think it's really pretty and it's
definitely a really easy thing to do
Oh can't get me a Ghirardelli Mina dear
