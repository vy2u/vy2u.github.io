[Laughter]
well hello and good morning everyone
welcome to the vlog right now it is
morning time I have some eye mask on to
try to hydrate I'm about to get ready my
hair is still pretty straight from
yesterday because I straightened it
yesterday so I think I'm gonna like keep
it just straight today a little bad boys
off I'm going to moisturize my face
first my tripod is so low and I've
didn't so on I'll get a nice workout
though so this morning we had room
service for breakfast and then we have
to go pick up our Creator passes and
then we have to actually go to the Jabba
Center for beautycon can use some extra
coverage because I have a pimple right
here of course perfect timing I'm
obviously not gonna show you my whole
makeup routine just because I can't like
hold the camera here the whole time
while I do my makeup so I am going to do
the rest of this I will show you guys
the finished look I'll show you my
outfit for today and then we'll head out
we just not ready this is the look I'll
have my mom fulfill my outfit trying to
cross the street mom and dad they both
look super cute so we're gonna take
pictures I just on the Koran dome
driveway wall
it's okay
I look like a Ghostbuster right now
[Laughter]
all of that I just walked so we're going
back to go get a drink cause I'm so
thirsty
okay here's look number two we just come
back from eating we literally just ate
dashed here got ready we're already late
for the party it started like 30 minutes
ago but that's okay we're all good
so I happen to actually buy this two
piece set from Zara I don't know if it
has like this cool pattern on it
literally yesterday so cuz I didn't
bring any extra outfits because I didn't
think I was going to any of the after
parties and then I just randomly decided
to and then thank God I bought this I'm
wearing my favorite orange the laura
mercier one I have some gold jewelry on
I'm wearing my brand new Dior sneakers
that was really difficult okay so we're
gonna go now
oh my god this is so pretty with the
building right behind you
okay okay back in the room I just
changed to some PJs got my Bieber merch
on there's not too much footage from the
after-party because I honestly wasn't
there for very long I was made people in
care for like 45 minutes I mean it was
fun I didn't get to see some of my
friends but I'm just not that much of a
party person I think it might even be
past midnight I'm not sure but it's like
midnight and I'm here just ordered pizza
and chicken wings so we're gonna eat
that I need to clean this all off and
then I'm gonna go to bed good morning
everyone I just took a shower which is
why my hair is wet our plans have
changed a bit I don't think that we are
going to be geek on day two so yeah I
don't really know what's gonna happen
today I guess we'll just like see as it
happens maybe we'll end up deciding to
go after we eat maybe we'll just walk
around the city I'm just gonna get ready
now I know we're gonna go out to eat and
get like a brunch or breakfast sort of
thing and then I guess we'll just see
from there we are downstairs at the
hotel right now we're going we just got
a good brunch recommendation so we're
gonna go get the booty which is great
cuz I'm starving
okay so I'm sorry it's so loud but right
now we're eating at jams look how pretty
this fruit bowl is oh my goodness it's
drizzled and honey I got some grapefruit
juice and my parents both got omelettes
and coffee
of course the bus comes over filming we
just finished eating those hair in my
mouth we just finish eating we're
waiting outside with our suitcases for
my dad he just got the car from the
garage and we're just waiting for him I
think we're gonna head him to Soho but
yeah we're skipping day two I feel so
bad that we're not going today too
because like I told a lot of people I
was going and like a lot of my friends
were going but I just you still don't
feel good yeah I'm still not over my
sickness my feet don't work anymore
um they're pretty much broken I'm
completely broken in the human being so
yeah it's not gonna work
and plus we checked out of our hotel
today and we can't take our suitcases
with us to beautycon so I was like I'm
not gonna walk around with suitcases
like that's so lame so yeah we're just
not go away it was for the people who
didn't get to see me at beautycon
I hope you enjoyed this my outfit of the
day by the way look at the drawer cam
