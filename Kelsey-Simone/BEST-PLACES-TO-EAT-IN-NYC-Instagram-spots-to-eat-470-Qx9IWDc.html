Fashion Week and in New York has some of
the best places to eat so you guys are
gonna follow me so we're gonna go to
some of my favorite videos for breakfast
lunch and dinner mom we're gonna do
brunch first and title eight
I'm starving we're gonna go to this
place called Wahlberg element it's
amazing it's so pretty everything while
we were young is such a beautiful
restaurant I first spotted it on
Instagram I saw tons of people going and
I was so jealous I was like I need to go
there and take some cute pictures if you
have an Instagram aesthetic or even just
want some cute pictures come here it's
becoming a really popular spot in New
York City and i 100% understand why and
I also love that the crew was totally
okay with me being obnoxious with my
cameras I guess they're just used to
people taking tons of pictures in there
but for a drink I ordered this lavender
ginger like spritzer the waiter
suggested it to me but it was so good I
never had anything like it and my mom
ordered an appetizer I was filming when
she ordered so I have no clue what this
actually is but it was like squash and
either like mozzarella or ricotta cheese
I don't know but it was good so I ate it
for our actual entrees my mom got
avocado toast and I got a bison burger
yes I did eat a burger for breakfast but
I love burgers also I love fries I have
a really bad problem I eat you french
fries probably like every single day I
ordered them as a side with everything
and their fries were really really good
here it was definitely a 10 out of 10
and they also gave us free dessert which
is pretty cool not sure why but it was
really really good and it had an edible
flower which is definitely a new thing
for me
so now we're heading to lunch before we
go to some events we're gonna go to Nomo
kitchen it's a really popular place here
in York City actually the food is so
good the place is beautiful I highly
recommend it the atmosphere of Nomo
definitely has city vibes I love the way
it feels in there there's a lot of good
music playing there's good energy and I
love that the rooftop is completely
see-through so there's a lot of bright
light and you can see a lot of the
buildings which is really nice for my
drink here I ordered a virgin mojito
which is basically a mojito without any
alcohol in it I get these all the time
because they're so so good seriously if
you've never had one I highly recommend
them like I said I do get them
everywhere but no lie this was probably
the best place that's ever made them
before and then for my entree I did get
a pizza
I know burgers pizza guys I seemed so
unhealthy but I got a margherita pizza
which is basically basil and mozzarella
cheese and it was so good it was a
flatbread pizza actually you guys know I
never lied to you do I ever do you see
that in the corner
I wanted a side of fries yes I did they
were amazing and then we got a dessert
we got this like chocolate mousse pot I
think it was called but it was so good
so I'm now going to dinner I'm so hungry
about 2:30 on Fifth Avenue it's a
rooftop place which if you're in New
York City it's definitely bucket list to
eat dinner on a rooftop you see they
make skyline buildings and you get
amazing food at the same time whether
you live in New York City or you're just
visiting here on vacation doing some
sort of activity or eating on a rooftop
is definitely a bucket-list thing you
have to try when you're here
rooftop restaurants are one of my
favorite places to eat when I'm in New
York City because you get a beautiful
view of the city you can get amazing
pictures and amazing food 2:30 on Fifth
Avenue is actually a buffet so
downstairs you get your food and then
you can bring it all up to the rooftop I
love the fact that they have palm tree
is mixed with the city skyline it
definitely feels like you're on vacation
and they give you these little
wristbands that make you look like you
went to a festival or something to drink
I got pineapple juice which was really
rad because not a lot of places sell
pineapple juice and I love it but like I
said it's buffet style so you can get
literally whatever you want and just
pile up I was eating bacon in the scene
because I love bacon
sorry vegans but yeah if you go
downstairs where the buffet is it's
actually a hotel and they have like a
little bar and club inside so it's
definitely got a cool atmosphere in
places that you can chill me and my
cousin Ashley did like the little photo
booth that they have in the little club
area it's a really fun place to go if
you just want to hang out and have some
food I highly recommend checking it out
now we're gonna get dessert which is my
favorite part so we're gonna go to this
place called cha-cha hotcha she's been
talking about it since we've gotten here
and I love
which is basically green tea they have
ice cream drinks and it's the cutest
place ever I'm gonna get some ice cream
I'm gonna get nice creamy these has been
what I've been craving the whole entire
time event here we had been talking
about cha cha matcha the whole entire
trip and we got lucky and ran into one
while shopping they do have multiple
locations all across the city we went to
the one in Tribeca as you can tell it
looks like a little candy Wonderland in
there everything is so cute you kind of
just want to take everything home even
though it's not at my aesthetic I
literally did not care I was like pink
is pretty much my new favorite color now
that I'm here you can see them making
all of the matcha which is really cool
there's all these glass countertops and
everything even the napkins even the
sugar packets had these cute little like
matcha puns on them everything is
adorable and let me tell you this is the
best ice cream I've ever had like I'm
not trying to exaggerate the best ice
cream I've ever had I love green tea
it's one of my favorite flavors that
things can come in and now that I've had
it in ice cream form I feel complete and
I'm so happy if you do like green tea
highly recommend trying this there were
a couple other drinks that my parents
got like they have like coconut and they
have just like coffee matcha they even
have like a rose hibiscus but as you can
see there are so many good places to eat
