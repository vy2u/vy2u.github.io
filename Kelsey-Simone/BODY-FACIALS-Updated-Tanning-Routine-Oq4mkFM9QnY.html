when we could talk into because he
yeah welcome back to my channel my name
is Kelsey if you're new here I thought I
would start introducing myself because I
never do that for today's video we're
gonna be doing what I call Body facials
I have a bajillion and one skincare
videos on my channel you guys know I
love skincare I take very good care of
my skin if you've seen my videos before
you know that I faked an ally fake tan
probably year round so I do have to keep
up with it and put a lot of effort into
the rest of my skin this video is gonna
be both like a mix of my body facial
routine plus like a little tagging
routine at the end also a little PSA for
this video it is not sponsored at all
these are all of my favorite products
what I love to use with this routine you
your body will be nourished your body
will be moisturized it will be glowing
it will be gleaming Beaman you you will
be a whole new woman whole new being
after this starting off your body
facials is pretty much the exact same
thing is starting a regular facial you
have to cleanse it so of course washing
your body now for washing my body I do
actually have like a moisturizing body
wash but I really like to use this is
from Lee octane this is their shower oil
so basically as you can see it looks
like an oil for your body but when you
mix it with the water it turns into like
milk and then it gets like sudsy and it
cleanses your body I like that it starts
off as an oil because it really sort of
nourishes your skin and sinks into your
skin while you're cleansing your body so
it leaves your skin super soft and it
moisturizes at the same time which is
great because like I said I have a
really dry skin so this helps me a line
for tanning I mean tanning on dry skin
is a really bad combination it looks not
cute at all it doesn't look cute or I'll
just use something like this that smells
really good this is my other favorite
this is my jo alone the most of Cartman
you guys know I talk about this like
crazy this is my favorite scent in the
entire world I've never had a body wash
that the set actually stays on you for
like a while so these are really great
we shave before I reapply fake Tanner
just because one the Tanner will seep
into your hair follicles and sort of
make brown polka dots all over your leg
and it sort of helps with it being more
of a smooth application and
Pachi and then we go on to my favorite
part I don't know why that's my favorite
part exfoliating exfoliation is also key
especially when you're doing fake
tanning because it will help to remove
all of the last layer of Tanner before
you put on the new stuff as well as get
rid of all of your dry dead skin so you
could have a smooth application and it
just makes you really soft either I'll
use something like this brush like a dry
exfoliating brush but sometimes I'll
actually wash my body with this so it's
like a double cleanse and exfoliate at
the same time but normally I will
actually do both and I'll do like an
exfoliant on top my top two favorite
exfoliant number one is the Frank Body
Coffee exfoliate I'm pretty sure I've
talked about this before because I love
this up at least once or twice on my
social media I talked about this because
I use this stuff like crazy I have maybe
nine packets of this under my sink right
now this is the coconut one which is my
favorite I don't have that much left but
I have some in the bottom um this stuff
smells amazing and they're made in
Australia it is a vegan I had to mention
that it was made in I'll show you
because I love Australian people shout
out to my Australian subscribers also I
like to use the ocean salt from lush
this is a product I've been using this
for years like so long my mom used to
use this and then I was stealing it from
her shower and now I use it it's got
coconut in it it's like lime and avocado
after I exfoliate I've added sort of a
new step into my routine I don't know
how to talk after we're done exfoliating
there's this new step that I've sort of
started adding in my routine that's part
of your regular skincare routine and I
never thought like why don't I just do
that on the rest of my body is a mask
like a face mask but like on your body I
was just really excited when it came to
my brain so I obviously don't do this
like religiously um only when I have an
excess amount of time to like put a mask
all over my body
but when I do it's great so well
normally DIY whatever mask is on my body
just because I don't even think in
stores i've ever seen like a body mask
and my face masks are like in pretty
jars that would cover like my entire
body in just one yogurt is really good
to use oatmeal is really good to use
honey is super moisturizing mashed up
bananas are really good you can use
avocados are really good ingredient
whatever I sort of have chilling in my
kitchen I'll sort of mix them up in a
bowl I'll normally just go for like
three maybe two or three ingredients and
then I'll put that just some mother it
all over I'll normally let that sit for
like five minutes while I do some other
stuff in the shower and then I'll rinse
it off for body moisturizing and have a
look I have a couple steps here this
product I wanted to talk about because
I've been using this since forever
I've been using this for so long and I
don't even think I've talked about it on
my channel before I I feel like maybe
once I might have but this is the lush
and I'm pretty sure it's called like the
magic bar I will link everything below
for you guys it smells amazing kind of
smells like the holidays to me but I
just love it so you basically just rub
it around your body and then like your
body temperature heat will sort of like
warm it up and smooth it all over your
legs or I will go for something like
this either a regular body cream this
one's from fresh this is the black th
defying age delaying body cream this is
really really great and then also this
product which I've been obsessed with
using I also stole this from my mom's
bathroom this is from Bobby Brown which
Bobby Brown actually has some really
good skincare um this is called their
extra bomb rinse and so basically have
you guys ever eaten lemon curd it's
basically it's like lemon curd in a jar
but it has more of like an oily
I wouldn't say Vaseline because it's not
like sticky but it has more of like an
oily texture almost like Vasiliy and I
don't know exactly how to describe the
texture of this it's definitely more
like a thick moisturizer if you really
really need that sort of extra to your
skin I would highly recommend using
something more intense like this one
send in my skincare routine then we move
on to the actual tan routine and now I
don't start my tanning routine right
after I finish I wait a couple of hours
for multiple reasons one you want to
wait till your body has come
completely soaked up every little inch
of moisturizer possible most tanners
including the one that I use the
products don't really gel together the
Tanner will sort of look uneven if you
put it on top of like a bunch of lotion
so you do have to let it seep in as well
as after I shave your pores do need to
close completely before you put on a
fake tanner otherwise it'll look like
you have polka dots all over your legs
so I do wait a couple of hours after
doing all of that to actually tan so for
my fake tanner this is loving tan this
is what I've used since the beginning of
my tanning era they are pretty much what
got me so obsessed with fake Channing
it's easy to use for me I like the
product
I like the formula I like the way that
it looks and then I also use their mitt
this is like my Holy Grail I highly
recommend this to everybody who wants to
fake tan or does fake tan this is the
most helpful thing to getting a smooth
Chan this has a preliminary tan on it
which basically means when you put it on
you do initially instantly see color
like you instantly notice a difference
and then it does develop more this one
fully develops in two hours which is
nice because that's their Express when
it dries really quickly it develops
really quickly because you're kind of
lazy and I don't like to wait for
anything
my routine does change depending if it's
summer or winter where if it's summer
and I'm obviously in and out of the
water every single day I do this stuff
more often and I fake tan every day I
know that's a lot but I put a lot of
effort into it every single day if you
put it on in the morning and you
instantly get what that day it is going
to for the most part come off so I most
likely reapply every day to every other
day during the summer but during the
winter which technically I'm still doing
my winter routine now I'd say I do this
about two times a week after my tan has
fully developed and I'm looking with a
bronzed goddess the only step left is
the afterglow the afterglow is some sort
of golden bronze goo I place all over my
skin to make me look
like i'm just-just shinin you know I'm
only gonna show you two products but I
have a bajillion I'm a bajillion
products for this the first one is also
from loving tan this is their bronze
shimmer luminous cream in the shape dark
they have medium dark and extra dark so
depending on how much added color you
want on top of your tan so this will
deepen your tin as well as it does have
gold shimmer inside of it which is
really nice so I use the dark this just
gives like a nice little tinge a little
extra of something this does wash off
immediately like obviously the mousse it
stains your skin like you will have it
on even after you get wet whereas this
is just a tinted lotion so once you let
your skin this will come off with the
mousse won't
are you picking up on a bun down also
recently I've started using this which
is the nataschab de Nona
glow this is their body glow in the
shade medium this does not give added
color to your skin the loving tan one
gives a little extra darkness this one
is just pure glow it looks just like a
liquid highlighter but you place it all
over your body I especially like putting
it so you look how pretty putting that
on your legs and on your chest in the
summer when you have like a nice address
on that is pretty much it I am ready to
go I am ready to glow yeah that is my
skin care body routine I hope you guys
enjoyed I hoped you gave us some sort of
