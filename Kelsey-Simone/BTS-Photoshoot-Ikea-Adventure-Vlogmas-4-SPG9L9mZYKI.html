it is a little past 2:00 and I just
finished editing is this a weird angle
cuz you guys are like above me I don't
know but you're on a tripod right now
I'm actually in a really big rush
because we're getting ready we're going
to Philly to have a little photo shoot
like an Instagram photo shoot for evolve
moisturizing with some fresh starting
off with that um the worst thing about
the winter is that the Sun goes down so
quickly so like this is really nice but
in two hours it's going to be really
dark and like almost out of this
foundation but I love it the Becca aqua
luminous this has been like my go-to
foundation bronzer got my baked Marc
Jacobs a night big Marc Jacobs duo this
huge bronzer and a huge bronzer brush
just to warm up my face and then
highlighter I've been using this the
NARS man-ray they sent this to me it's
in the shade double take I it's cracked
which is really sad but I love it oh
sorry sorry until Tommy oh my god why
are you being such a spaz
oh nice we're gonna shoot with that
today
look how pretty we can honestly take a
picture here by the boats yeah to my
vlog so we're finally in Philly we just
got here we just parked mom's gonna take
some pics of me we're probably going to
take pictures over there on the pier by
the bridge so the fit of the day comes
soon
so I definitely think we got the shop oh
we're taking more anyways just to have
like as much content as possible but
yeah I'm really excited I'm really
excited we're trying to do this as fast
as possible because this Sun is like
already setting but I'm so hungry I'm
like I said I was editing I was editing
all this morning so I haven't even eaten
anything yet and it's like 3:30 so right
after this we're going to get something
to eat so
my dad's gonna take over he's going to
be the vlog man
so we're going down that pier there's
like wooden steps I've shot oh look look
there before so on CC you might
recognize it oh my god I almost tripped
it's a recording yes
it's a preview of some of them cook so
good so now we're at the end of the pier
it's so pretty but it's freezing okay so
we're gonna try to take some pictures
like right here or let's do it like more
right here so it's like minimal
there's a trade right now but right now
we are going to go to eat finally right
starving yes yes okay we're going to go
eat iced tea my favorite and I do the
beef kabob with a side of the fries
what's really good I want to get on it
wait no just go where we're supposed to
go my god right IKEA if you can't tell
okay we'll go get another one very hot
and I here right now but hey you killed
one what'd you do
my mom just confessed she ran over a
squirrel okay well buy it so it could be
like a tribute to the squirrel you
killed yes the lighting is really good
in here so I kind of got suckered into
going into the rest of the store because
like it's trashed yeah you girls got
free ice cream actually it wasn't free
huh it was a dollar so right now I'm
back home as you can see have some boxes
so what I got is two of those though
like shoe shelves it's hard to describe
and they basically just like sit on the
floor so you can organize your shoes
better so my plan is if you guys know if
you've like seen like a room tour of
mine before where my nerd cave is I plan
on turning that into like a shoe cave
now because well one I'm running out of
space in my closet I have way too many
clothes and shoes and everything so I
need more space
so I'm turning that into a shoe closet
as well as our basement right now is
basically just like my gaming room and
then it flows into like my dad's nerd
cave and we have like a lot of space
down there so I'm basically going to
take a portion of that because we have a
lot of room like I said to put my nerd
cave so
like my dad's nerd cape and mine
combined and then like my gaming room so
yeah so I got two of these so they can
like I have a shelf back there and sit
underneath the shelf so I can put shoes
on the shelf and then shoes on the floor
and then shoes on top of these so that
way I'll have like three stacks of shoes
if that makes sense I just thought it
would be really good organization um I'm
gonna do it right now but once it's done
I'll probably end up showing you guys
I'm definitely gonna do it like soon so
you guys will be able to see it yeah

more like behind the scenes stuff like
