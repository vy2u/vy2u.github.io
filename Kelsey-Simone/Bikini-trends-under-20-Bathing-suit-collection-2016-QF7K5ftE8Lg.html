get my life together
hey guys it's Kelsey today I'm gonna be
doing a bathing suit collection slash
bikini bathing suit haul I literally
went ham on this one website but that
it's okay you know
all of these bathing suits were insanely
cheap they were all under $20 which is
crazy because I have some that are like
kind of like imitations of trends right
now sort of thing so I will link all the
bathing suits and the website that I got
them from they're from Zach accom I've
had baby shoes from them before I did
like another haul and I got bathing
suits and they're so cute I mean they're
good quality this bathing suit you've
probably seen a lot of people wear
recently
literally I do not wear color as you can
tell from this video there's no color in
my life so this will be something new
but I really liked it all the way enough
it has this like multi-coloured like
knit thread around the outside and then
it's just white on the inside of the
bikini and it fits me so perfectly I
can't even tell you it's really
comfortable and I know I just like it
it's really cute
this next bathing suit I'm so obsessed
with like I can't tell you how cute this
is these are the bottoms they have like
these stripes on the top but like they
have see-through material so I don't
know it's just like an illusion kind of
thing it just looks really cool when
it's on and I like them and they fit me
perfectly and then the top is like this
same little like illusion the back has
like this gold clasp which I really like
and then I also got this one piece I
have a couple of one pieces mixed into
here this one is just like a really low
back in low side low front low
everything um just a one piece this is
oh it's inside out these are pretty
popular just like the open size low back
black one-piece this one is so cool this
one I probably wouldn't wear out in like
public just because I'm a little bit on
the conservative side I literally saw it
and I was just like that's so cute like
I don't even care if I'm not going to
wear it like it's just something that
like I want because it's so visually
using so it is a one-piece and it like
ties around the neck and then it has
these see-through top parts with like
the black oh my gosh flowers on it and
this part is so soft so it fits me
literally perfect oh and then this one's
really cute too this one is like um my
gosh it has cat hair all over it base
its getting my lip gloss kinda gives me
like Rasta vibes which I really really
like I think it's really cute it's like
this knit bathing suit and this one has
color has like that sort of mustardy
color on it but I kind of I kind of dig
it so just like black/white with like
that again mustardy color on it and then
the top is like the same and this is so
comfortable perfect love it oh my gosh I
love this one this one's like kind of
looks like you're wearing a bra lid but
you're not so these bottoms are like
super-high races as you can see they're
actually I thought they're gonna be
really cheeky but they're not really
cheeky but they're just like really high
waisted and it has like the lace on the
top and then the bralette has the same
thing it's just like really lacy and it
looks just like a bralette but it's made
out of a ting suit material so I think
it's like really pretty my goal was to
get like a really pretty white bathing
suit so there it is let's see let's see
ooh this one's so cute
no those like lace-up little like tie up
shirts everybody's obsessed with this is
that but like a bathing suit so it has
like the lace up the front like how cute
is that and then it like Criss crosses
on the back and it's pretty like
covering because it kind of looks like a
sports bra which I like that and then
the bottoms have it on the sides which
I'm obsessed with these bottoms these
are so cute I love just like the lace-up
on the side I think it's so pretty and
then these I got accidentally the same
pair in two different colors but it's
okay because they're really cute I've
got the nude one because I wanted a new
bathing suit even though you kind of
look naked but like now that I have a
tan it's like a different color so you
don't look at that naked um so these are
the bottoms they're just like regular
bathing suit bottoms with just like two
ties on the side and then it's just like
a basic like bikini top but like the
tops are like squared off if you can see
what I mean
kind of thing it's really cute it's a
really flattering bikini
my body I like it accessorize it with
like chokers and like a cute pair of
shorts over the top and feel like going
to the beach kind of thing and then I
also got the same pair in white so if
you're really into one pieces this one
was so cute
so it has it's basically just like this
black and white palm tree print which I
love so cute and then the back laces up
and it's not like too skimpy at all and
it has like two straps really cute what
I like about this one it's like so cute
like it's not like just totally covering
with them like ugly like I hate that hey
I'm wearing one-piece but like I'm still
really cool and on trend and I got this
one
which was so cool in the picture I was
like I have to get this and see what it
looks like on it is it just another
bikini but it's like nude with like
these black mesh lines over it I don't
even know how to describe it there's
just like crisscross lines over the top
of it and then like ties and strings and
then the top is the same way um it's all
twisted my gosh you can't even get my
life together these like lines on it I
don't even know what I'm talking about
so yeah I think it's really cute I love
it this is another one where it's just
like the print on it was really cool
it's kind of like a on like a fish net
sort of thing but nude and then the
ropes are the ropes the straps are
braided which I thought was really
really cool and then it has like
crisscross II designs in the back and
then the bottoms are the same way where
they have like the fishnet thingy with
like all the braids on the side these
ones are a little bit cheeky on me so if
you're on the conservative side and you
don't like cheeky bathing suits I
wouldn't recommend this one exit I got
this gray one it's kind of like a simple
top again it looks like a bralette it
just has those three little lines like
in the center of the bathing suit and
then the back is just like super strappy
and has like all these lines like caging
in the back kind of thing what's caging
another great bathing suit this one has
like really cute they're all like the
same color grace you did like easily
swap out the bottoms
um these have like three lines on the
side and then this one is just like a
regular top but light has like this
braided back I like like the little
dainty details so cute and then I got a
brown pair because I was feeling even
more
venturous and I got this one again just
has like all the Criss crosses in the
front and it's really cute it has these
little like silver like circles in it
which are also on the bathing so you
forgot to mention every single bathing
suit I got in a size small but if you're
small and you have like a good amount of
like goods good Mota Goods then I'd
recommend getting a medium this pair is
like really simple but like the model
just like rocked it on the website and I
was like you go girl like I'm buying
this bathing suit again like a black
bralette and it has this like X in the
front besides have like X's as well and
yeah these are really comfortable
bottoms and I like the way these fit me
out of all the bathing suits this is
probably like the one with the best
fitting bottoms I feel like these ones
just like local really good on me and I
got a mismatched pair because like
that's a thing apparently and basically
based I say basically so much shut up
Kelsey oh this is like mesh all around
like a Center and on the straps it's
like messy and then it came with a
yellow bottoms but it just had like the
three straps on the side and this
bathing suit out of all of them this was
the one that was small on me so if you
want to get this bathing suit like if
you like this one I'd recommend getting
a size bigger in this one but this one's
really cute it's like a two-piece but
this one goes really really high waisted
and then it has like all these X's on
the sides which is so cute and just a
stripe detail which is really cute and
then it has like the top which is sort
of like a sports bra it just has like
the X in the back and I love the straps
and the last bathing suit I got is
another one-piece it's just like a plain
it is so wrapped up
oh this one is just like a plain one
piece and it kinda has a halter top and
then it goes really low in the back and
just X's in the back with the straps
which is really cute and again this one
was kind of tight on these I like the
way they make their bathing suits I hate
white you like getting white bathing
suits or like a light-colored bathing
suits and you can like see-through that
like you can't see through this which is
really great and yeah that was all so
really hot yeah those are the bathing
suits and like I said I will link all
them down below in the description if
you want to get any of them and then
I'll have Zappos website link down below

search the whole website and then yeah
