getting ready process but we are gonna
get ready right now to go so my hair
looks really bad I have to do it but um
so this morning I stopped over at Acme
and picked up stuff so I have like a
really bad blister obviously i socks on
I can't show you but I have like a
really bad cut on my ankle that's like
still freshly wounded and open right now
it's exactly 12 o'clock on the dot I
have to meet Melissa there at 2:00 okay
so I just washed my face that's what
it's kind of red I'm gonna use the CEO
I'm gonna use this this is the CEO a
rapid flash brightening serum from
Sunday Riley to moisturize and brighten
my face
I'm not gonna show you guys like a fool
get ready with me I'll probably do one
of those soon for vlogmas eventually but
i feel like that would just take up too
much time this is the farce ollie aisle
this is the rose gold elixir one I love
this face oil this stuff makes your
foundation look so good if you like that
glowy dewy look I highly recommend
putting on this face oil and then also
recently I haven't been using concealer
I've been using this which is the Y cell
it's like a brightener it's supposed to
be like a coloring corrector so it's
just like this really bright like
brightener so it's just a brightener it
has no coverage so I put that underneath
just a little bit so I'm probably gonna
stop here the next time I'll see you
guys is when I'll be with Melissa so I'm
here with Melissa we yeah they're
completely sold out for tickets
we went and it's just like completely
sold out there's I don't know if you can
