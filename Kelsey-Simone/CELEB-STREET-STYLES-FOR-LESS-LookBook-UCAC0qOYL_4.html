hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a look book with outfits inspired by or
a recreation of celebrity Street style
outfits I'm going to be showing you not
only the outfits but how to get exactly
what celebrities are wearing on the
street or even what I'm wearing in my
Instagram pictures or YouTube videos if
you want to know how to do that and then
keep on watching
so if you guys want all the details and
links to all the clothes I'm going to be
wearing throughout the lookbook
all the information will be on my
profile on the aperture OBO if you don't
have the app you should totally go
download it it is an app that helps you
find where things are from in pictures
say if it's my picture or my YouTube
video or your favorite youtubers video
or even a celebrity Instagram picture
you can find what they're wearing on
this app so all the information will be
on my profile I find tons of stuff that
are on celebrities that I even used for
this video on the app it's really easy
to use so Trofeo app is honestly so
helpful when it comes to fashion I have
an online shopping addiction so I follow
tons of stylists fashion bloggers
celebrities all types of people that you
can find even on the popular page tons
of cute outfits and inspiration that you
can directly shop from like how cool is
that you can look at what people are
wearing and add it to a wishlist or if
you own the clothes yourself you can add
it to your own wardrobe and upload your
own outfits for other people to shop
from so for example if you go on a
picture you can see what people are
wearing and there are tons of
celebrities to look from even Justin
Bieber tons of models and stylist
anybody you could think of that you
would want their clothes from you can
search through their Instagram photos
and see exactly the links of exactly
what they're wearing which I'm always
wondering what people are wearing I know
you guys are too especially you guys are
always commenting on my photos hey
where'd you get that top or where your
shoes from you can find all that info on
my dromio profile which is just Kelsey
Simone the same thing as my youtube
channel so I'm going to show you how to
upload a picture because it's really
really easy the first thing you're going
to want to do is all the clothing that
you are wearing in the picture you're
going to upload you're going to want to
find it on the app in the picture I'm
about to upload I was wearing a pair of
jeans that were from Urban Outfitters
and they had them right there so you're
going to click have it which is going to
add it to your wardrobe what your
wardrobe is is this little section on
your profile that shows basically
everything that you actually own so once
you have everything from your picture
you're going to click the little plus
button and you're going to add the photo
from your photo album so I click the one
that I wanted you can filter you know
add a caption and everything but right
here it's going to show you every single
thing from your wardrobe and you're
going to click
to add everything that you're wearing in
the picture so I added the shoes the top
the jacket and the jeans now you're
going to capture it just like a regular
Instagram picture I try to make my funny
most times I don't know if you guys
think my captions are funny they're
probably not but anyways it's literally
that easy
now it's posted on my profile so after
this video is up I'll obviously have all
the outfits up and I'll put some
Instagram pictures that I have on my
Instagram to show you where everything
is from and then the best part you can
click the direct link to go buy it from
the store of wherever it is from which
is really useful if you love shopping
just as much as I do also if you go
download the Drobo app and follow me I'm
going to be looking through your profile
so if you have some cute outfits I'm
going to be following five of you guys
