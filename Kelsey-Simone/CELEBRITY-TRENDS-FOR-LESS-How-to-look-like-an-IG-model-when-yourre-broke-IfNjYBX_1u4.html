video for you I have like like a part
two to my bottom booty on a budget video
so I have a ton of cool clothes that I
picked out that either looks like
something that's designer it's an
Instagram trend it's something a
celebrity or like a model wore but it's
either less than or about half the price
of the original item I feel like there's
so much fashion out there that's super
trendy but is very over price all of
these items will be linked in the
description grow I've got shoe by the
way you can cop this earring this is one
of the pieces that I have it's like this
gold rhinestone like paper clip earring
how cool is that it probably looks
bougie right it was five bucks Lincoln
bio honestly just thank you to sample
for having the best prices and saving
some fashion lives out here everything
that I have is from the websites Apple
comm I've worked with them before like
what four five times I love them
everything super nice quality everything
fits nothing's come broken and
everything is a good price oh I don't
even know what to start off with because
they've so many few things so the first
top that I'm going to start off with is
so insanely cool I was super excited
about that I'm obsessed with denim you
guys know that now I can finally say
that I have a denim top it's this cool
like open back wrap top and it has it's
a cold distress is that not intense it's
super I've never described a shirt is
intense I like that there was this dress
that kendall Jenner more recently it's
like this exact shirt but like the dress
form I honestly like it better too sure
I don't really like it as a dress
because I feel like if I wore that I'd
probably just look like a farm girl I
did all the research for you you're
welcome
I also tracked down where it was
originally from to like see the price
and then I'm going to compare it with
the price that I actually have it for a
dress that she wore was eight hundred
and twenty five dollars this top is only
twenty-two bucks honestly I prefer this
better anyways so the next top I have is
like an exact replica this is a top that
Bella wore it is this white halter top
that laces up all the way in the front
and it has these two little strappy
pieces at the bottom again I do like
this one better than the one she was
wearing actually has this one is a
little bit longer hers was like really
cropped so it shows like on your boob
and eyen about that so the top that
Bella wore the one that she actually
as is not even out for sale it's like an
off the runway piece
it's from the diesel black gold spring
2017 collection and this one is only 20
bucks so this is again definitely a win
the next item that I have I'm so very in
love with so this is kind of hard to
show like in the camera but it is this
super gorgeous black silk dress but it's
not just silk it's stretched silk which
I didn't even know that was a thing
before but like it's super stretchy it
has these like little triangular cutouts
on the side which are kind of cool so
this is a remake of a very popular dress
kendall jenner has won this dress tons
of Instagram girls wear this dress I
thought it was a super pretty dress and
I actually wanted to get one for myself
but it's 350 dollars if that one has it
for $12 so if you wanted to pick one up
definitely links in the bio also the hot
seller is the classic straight across
bodysuit these I've been loving
everybody's been loving but it's also
not basing enough where you can't just
find this anywhere the original bodysuit
is 120 bucks which is on the pricier
side for a bodysuit I got these for 15
bucks each I got two of them I got a
black one and then I got this army green
one which I thought was really pretty
quickly I wanted to go through some
sunglasses because I did get a couple
pairs of sunglasses from Zappos so these
ones were actually a remake of a pair
that I was going to get the real one I
think they were either 100 or 150 bucks
which is a lot for sunglasses these ones
are only 7 bucks I like the gold I think
they're really cool I like the square
shape these ones are also so sick these
ones have pearls Crucible nose rest I
don't know if you guys can see that the
lenses are sort of purple these ones
come in like a bunch of different colors
these I didn't even notice these and I
saw them online but their little hands
like their gold hands that hold the size
to the frame the other parent that I got
were these they're sort of these gold
framed yellow straight across they're
super cool I love the way they look when
you put them on like right now
everything looks so florescent so these
ones are eight bucks as well as the
little hand sunglasses the other pair
that I got are the
he's super sick again black and gold
frames these have super big frames
they're a little big for my face but I
kinda like it I don't know if we're six
bucks okay I've been looking for this
everywhere and I didn't think I was
going to find it
so these bathing suits have been like
everything right now I've seen them all
over Instagram this sort of like
underwire I don't know but it's really
cool found the actual website that sells
them they were 60 bucks from the top not
including the bottoms like you had to
buy the top and bottom separately
we're on zaple you get two and one like
you don't have to pay separately for the
bottom from the top it was only 12 bucks
for the full set so that was really nice
and I got it in the color that I wanted
the other bathing suit that I got I'm
super hype about Optus like rusty orange
color which is like totally out there
for me guys so there's this one like
super popular Instagram bikini website
though I checked their price I thought
they were going to be cheap but it was a
hundred for the top and 85 for the
bottom whereas this one was $13 it's
super comfortable it fits me really
nicely so from the same popular
Instagram site they have the one-piece
bathing suits that are like super
high-waisted with a really low back but
it was 200 bucks and this one was only
16 bucks it got one in white from zaple
this one is actually a bodysuit this is
not a bathing suit so it's like cotton
material also I got this top because I
kind of got sucked in after I saw that
pop I was like I love low back tops and
I don't have enough I got this white
ribbed tee shirt that has like a
completely open back is that not insane
it is the shirt was only 12 bucks so I
was like of course next we have the
classic the classic Kelsey a striped
button-up flowy tops but I I don't have
one in this color it's topped with 15
bucks which is really good I have tons
of designer nice ones that I'm sure is
what all the like celebrities have of
like the nicer brand I love this this is
a must happen for 15 bucks you need to
get it because you're going to wear this
with so many office vintage distressed
denim is like the everything of summer I
normally get them like from urban where
they're like custom done or can be like
70 bucks normally and the jeans can go
up to like a hundred bucks sometimes so
I was like that's a lot you know I've
been looking for white cute vintage
cutoff shorts and I was going to get a
pair
till I saw these ones on their website
and just notice how perfect they were um
they look so good on like they fit me so
nicely so the shorts were $14 and these
were only $25 I got these jeans which
look just like a really nice pair of
vintage distress jeans they're cut off
at the bottom these ones even have like
a little thigh rip at the bottom this is
also a super big trend right now is the
two-tone Jean it also have the square
cutout at the bottom that I love so much
I think it looks really cool with like
whatever shoe you wear these ones are
really these are really cool so these
are super stretchy they're really
comfortable they're like actual like
really distressed holes and then the
bottom of the jeans have this slit going
up but it just looks really cool you put
them on you they're super nice I love
them
they were 35 bucks and I'm obsessed from
them recently in a video I did like a
haul of when I went to Paris and I got
these Jean everybody loves them thought
they were super cute but there were 110
bucks which is a little bit pricey for a
pair of jeans these are only twenty-two
bucks I got these which looks so similar
they're a little different but I really
like them so they are these high-waisted
dark blue jeans with this light
distressing down the side and so just
like my jeans they sort of like flare
out and get bigger at the bottom and
they're full-day let's talk about these
because use made me really happy
these are so pretty like they're just so
pretty like this looks really good of
something out there right now like if
you're not wearing another print it goes
with pretty much anything I typed in
leopard heels and they came right up and
the first brand was 100 bucks which is
this these are only $35 which is such a
better steal who is not honestly been
wearing slides like this this summer
everybody has been obsessed with slides
these ones are only 34 dollars which
compared to the Gucci size which can
range between six hundred and fifty
dollars to fourteen hundred and fifty
dollars 35 bucks sounds really nice
they are velvet they have this sort of
like embroidered floral having their
comfort shoes but they're still very
gorgeous comfort shoes you know there
were these heels okay
I saw one day I was obsessed with them I
can't find the original person who makes
these like rhinestone heeled I did find
them on one web site for 102
bucks odds apples I saw these gorgeous
faces last month of my face heels like
this and these lawns are rhinestone
dazzled on the heels just like those
shoes I wanted the detail on it is so
pretty
these were 58 bucks which again still is
not that bad their suede black heeled
boots that are freaking bedazzled so I
actually have one more bathing suit I
wanted to show you so I got this nude
one from Zappa that I'm very pleased
with it's so pretty it's like a
champagne color it's like a sports bra
fit which I really like I feel like
those look good on me this one's only
$13 so I don't think you can compete
with that also speaking of velvet this
is not like a particular like look of
someone's but this is just a really nice
piece I had to get it it's sort of that
long-sleeve colors but enough that I
like but except it doesn't button-up
it's like actually a dress I can't tell
you how in love I am with it it was only
13 bucks yes yes please the next piece
that I got I also love so much it looks
adorable over anything it's this white
lace little tank top crop top it would
honestly look good over this I know the
typical trend is like to put the black
lace over the white t-shirt that's like
this thing but I wanted to get the white
one because I have mostly a lot of black
tops this lace table was only 16 dollars
which is pretty good I couldn't find one
exactly like this or like the one that
I've seen like celebrities wearing the
next top that I have is this top which I
wore in like one of my really recent
videos like two videos ago I wear this
and a lot of you liked it this plain
white cropped tank top that says are we
having fun yet yes I am so I looked it
up it wasn't that bad it was only $35
zaple still did a better they have it
for $15 which is really cool next thing
that I have I love this I've seen this a
bunch on Instagram as well there was
this one Instagram picture I saw this
girl is wearing it over her bathing suit
I was like I need that as a cover-up but
it's like a halter dress that it's kind
of see-through so it's perfect is like a
bathing suit cover-up it laces up in the
back I looked this up on where they sold
it and found it for only like 45 50
bucks which it's a little bit pricey as
one was $14 which is again so much
better than $50 we're getting to the
last couple of items it's this silk
little triangle cut shaped tank top this
is $19 which is so much better compared
to where I found it for $180 which is
insane this little number I've seen a
couple of places and I thought it was so
insanely cool it's this leather skirt
that looks exactly like an actual
leather jacket found at the original
place where it's from and it's $62 but
ons Apple they have it for only $23
which is again so much better then I
have this which was like a goal for
Mexico
I want something slowly and pinstripe
for the beach so this is the bando top
it's super flowy and really pretty
honestly you could wear this as a top by
itself was just like shorts or something
but it comes with these matching pants
which are the same sort of pinstripe
they're super flowy and long and
comfortable and they flare out so big
they're slit which is perfect for the
summer so I found something similar to
this it was 130 dollars compared to this
one which is twenty seven dollars which
$27 is really good because you're
getting both a shirt and a pants which a
shirt and a pants a shirt and pants then
I have this which I know it's a sweater
and I know it's summer but I'm the
stupid person who wears sweaters in the
summer the striped shirts are super cool
but this one has this random two yellow
stripes I thought that was really cool
it gave me this really just grungy vibe
that I really liked it was only 18
dollars which is a great price for a
knit sweater I almost forgot I got the
super cute like gold and white little
like almost should out looking like bag
like how adorable is that like all
frayed and distressed like the bold
detail especially on the chain because I
wear a lot of gold so gold goes with
gold you have only 25 bucks
so definitely needed it that was a lot
okay I hope you guys enjoyed this video

were looking for a top but you were like
I don't want to pay 150 bucks for it
