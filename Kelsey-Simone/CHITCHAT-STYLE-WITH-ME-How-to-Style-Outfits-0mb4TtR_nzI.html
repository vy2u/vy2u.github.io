the floor so on the healthy Simone
channel lately we've been trying so many
new things again today I'm here with a
brand new video idea I was thinking for
this video kind of like doing a chit
chat get ready with me where you like
talk while you do your makeup I wanted
to do a fashion related video because I
feel like my whole youtube channel I
love fashion fashions my passion ah ha
ha that is my passion I thought why not
do like a chit chat style with me today
we're going to be styling some clothes
I'm going to give you tips on like how
to style we're just going to talk about
life and how fun time to snack if you
want I sadly don't have this back right
now I should have brought one we're just
going to be styling for outfits
I'll wear throughout the week for
Instagram pics you know whatever so
basically in my process of styling the
first thing we'll think about is like
what sort of vibe I'm going for in
fashion I feel it I have 10 different
personalities I have so many different
styles and fashions sometimes I'm really
edgy and sometimes I'm like what you see
on my Instagram now is like very like
girly classy like white flowy shirt sort
of thing so today we're going to sound
like a bunch of different stuff you guys
might remember this because I put it in
a hall but I still have not worn it yet
how'd it sound it haven't taken a
picture and it got these super wide
distressed sleeves I love them usually
what I do when I go shopping which helps
so much in picking out outfits is when I
buy something like this for example
before I buy it I normally think in my
head like out of stuff I already have at
least one or two ways I'm going to style
it so normally when I get dressed and I
pick out a piece the first two items I'm
probably gonna style it or what I was
already thinking in my head when I
bought it so when I bought this
initially the first thing I thought
about styling it with was like a pair of
like light blue cutoff shorts these are
really cute these are like light wash
blue denim cut off high-waisted
everything I need for this so I'm
probably just like leave it loose over
the shorts and just like talk one corner
and you know let's lay that out and like
I said in a video before accessories
pull together the whole look so I think
I'd probably add like a belt to it black
and gold belt would look perfect and
you're still going to be able to see it
because like I said you talked in like
one corner
sweater these ones would work these are
super cute yeah I read these ones are
little black music from Topshop likes
appointed cat eye ones are really small
and then like a black hat to tie it all
together I have this one like this furry
knit hat I like the shape of it I think
the Hat goes because it ties everything
together with the black belt and the
black star glasses having the black hat
and then I think I'm going to put black
shoes these are like my most worn sort
of everyday shoes you know because I'm a
little short and I like to elongate my
legs when I'm wearing shorts I like
shoes that don't cut off my ankle
because it'll make your legs look longer
so I'm thinking I'm thinking like
something like this would look really
good so now with all the accessories we
have a lot going on so I'm thinking a
more simple bag think this strap would
look really pretty across like the white
knit shirt yes okay that's perfect
okay first outfit next outfit well
should we go with let's do Jesus these
are like my fav I have these Levi's ones
so proud that I've drifted these yes I
did they fit so good these are probably
my best fitting jeans another thing that
I like to do is match all colors so
sometimes I'll do like a solid color
outfit to break it up a little bit so
that it's not like completely all black
I'll normally like break it up with like
a shirt that's cropped or something that
has like an open neckline because I know
it'll just sort of swallow you up you
know what I'm saying this one is cool
and then I also have this one
it looks just like a tube top and it's
like ribbed and really stretchy um but
it was an awkward length so I folded it
down one and it looks really cool it's
like this cool little like bandeau top
used to brain sync outside of the box so
this is really cool also I have this top
which I got from princess Polly you just
I'm like a little not like that which
ones would be cooler though
ah see I wish you guys were here with me
because then you could help me I think
I'm going to go with this one I don't
know why thing we're going to go with it
to the bag I think I'm going to go with
this one because I do want the pop of
gold you know I love my black and gold
combination so I'm going to go with this
one and I'm going to like super gold
accessorize says these hoops are super
sick I haven't wore them yet they're
like these gold hoops with like
rhinestones all over them love them
probably do like a bunch of like layered
necklaces Apple look really good
especially because it's off the shoulder
top I love these these are my fave my
ASOS the brown ones these ones would
look really cool if you're like both a
sneaker like a white sneaker would look
really good with this as well we're like
a heel with look goes with this too but
again it all depends where I'm going so
I'm thinking like one we can go with
like a white sneaker just select a
little pop after way that would look so
good playing all-black outfit and I'm
just like the white sneaker but also
like these snakes can heels would look
good I'm going to go with both because I
feel like when you're taking an
Instagram picture heels are definitely
better but for comfort wise if I'm just
going to walk around in this outfit I
change into sneakers wow we are saying
and Althea's looks right now I'm so
proud of this guy's so another tip that
I have when styling I forgot to say this
earlier but I'll normally style
essentially around one center piece as
you've noticed I'll start with one item
and then pick things that go out with
that so normally have like a specific
trend in mind a specific item in mind so
the next item I have this you might have
seen this on my social media already but
I've been so obsessed with fanny packs
fanny packs abhimanyu's thing lately
like they are many things it honestly
put this on topic could you put this on
top of a dress quick question I want to
know that I want to know if I can put
this on top of a dress this looks so
good and honestly this could be my next
outfit I also like this because the
dress is so super huge it's not the most
flattering dress so I feel like this
sort of cinches the waist a little bit
and it looks a lot better now that I
have this off love it
hello girl what okay these are hiding
back there
in there from Zara they're pointing to
toe that they're like this silver crow
which kind of ties in with the fanny
pack because it has silver this just
looks really good
okay this is my next outfit just kidding
wow that was such a surprise outfit okay
so I just grabbed this jacket love this
jacket this vintage Levi's denim jacket
it's a reversible jacket that's green
corduroy on the inside I love this piece
so much now what I'm thinking right now
matching denim on denim look I love a
great denim on denim look so I have
these vintage Levi's as well these are
like pretty much the exact same color so
it looks like a matching set love it I
said I should do something cropped
definitely because it's such a big
jacket what I'm thinking looks good
I already spelled with another outfit
and I might just suck it up and wear it
again this ribbed to top would also look
really good making my black bag would
look so pretty with this they're from
this guided these would look really good
with this look from my gray section I
picked on this top this is a recent
purchase I got it from Free People it's
like this like school plaid for going
with the outfit that I spelled it with
in my head these jeans which you guys
saw in my video where I spelled ten
outfits out of seven pieces these were
the jeans that I wore they're super
super baggy jeans this would look so
good and I just spotted something that
would look over this okay
this necklace is sick it's like this
really thick gold chain it's like a
vintage Juicy Couture necklace this bag
would look really good I think that if I
have the bando top with this necklace
with the matching chain I feel like it's
good well you see those bad boys back
there these are from Sydney shoes these
are these chunky black heels that have
like built on fishnet which is super
cool this would look so sick with that
that would look so good okay that is a
lot of that is it those are all the
outfits that I'm going to style with you
