just the flooring okay is that like a
marble granite yeah and you could say or
like marble granite on a budget you
could say and look at that like
architecture yeah a very intricate
design of the house and then last but
not least the best part is that
intricate detail of the roofing and down
the middle just kind of looks like mold
to be honest well I guess we're not
buying this house um it'll stay on the
market for a while yeah I don't really
