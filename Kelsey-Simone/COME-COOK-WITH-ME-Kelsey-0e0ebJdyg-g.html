weird you know with avocados huh
hello everybody and welcome to my
kitchen so today I'm in a different
place than normally well I really didn't
know what I was gonna film this week and
so I went on the internet and I was
looking for each video ideas to film
because I'm so original and so I came
across a bunch of youtubers we're doing
like cooking with insert youtuber name
here so here I am doing one of those
then I was like what am I gonna cook
then I wanna lean on it again for more
as you can tell original ideas and I was
like I'm just gonna do a very
aesthetically themed on a tumblr we
hearted Instagram inspired lunch that
you can make yourself and it'll look
like you're like one of those really
professional to the bloggers but like
we're not actually but like you don't
have to tell anybody that so let's get
started I have all of my dishes set over
there you're gonna need stuff to put
your food and doc first thing I wanted
to make was the classic avocado toast
with a sunny-side-up egg on it with the
egg broken oh wow we've changed angles
how cool okay so I got tons of cute
stuff
that's step one get cute stuff to put
your food on okay I need to make toast
that's all stuff we're not making toast
I decided to be even more true to the
picture I'm looking at and make it with
a bagel a bagel oh this is an onion
bagel pretty much the same thing right
and we're making plenty of side so I'm
not going to make the top of the bagel I
feel really bad for the person who's
going to get that one little top of a
bagel not me oh I'm gonna use one of a
 Oh since I'm only doing one half of
a toast and we're going to cut it up
well this video is interesting already
know what I like to do that's really
easy is you take a spoon la yeah I know
like I said I'm pretty good at
everything okay
toast is done oh my gosh the egg okay we
have to make an egg - switching camera
angles again so how to make an egg first
you put butter in a pan I have a pro tip
for being a pro if you're bad at things
like I am and I'm pretty good at
everything get one of these basically
it's just like a cookie cutter and like
you melt the butter you put this down to
crack the egg inside of it and you wait
for like the bottom - like hard enough
and then you shake this off and it's
like literally a perfect circle so
you're welcome
there we go and now we wait
look how beautiful
okay I've never been good at this guy's
so oh yeah oh I'm really proud of myself
the list so I'm going to put some
avocado on my toast now I kind of pop
the yolk a little bit but there's still
some left should we put the other side
it's gonna look pretty again that looks
prettier we get some other stuff from
the fridge beautiful look how beautiful
that looks
Wow me wow that looks fancy we're going
to cut up some cheese take it look
insane yeah why is this so hard did this
come from a bunch of tiny packs of
danimals yogurt maybe it did maybe it
did I'm gonna get some granola from
Whole Foods because I'm just I have a
gal in it so my yogurt is peach and
that's kind of like extra foodie gonna
erase some of my cheese here maybe like
ooh that angle though now you start
prepping this is the prepping for the
Instagram pic and then I actually liked
the fake leaf it looked pretty cool when
you touching right here like I move the
camera a little bit so you can see
better I found this little tiny bowl
from Anthropologie I think put some
fruit in it we'll put a big chunk at the
bottom its pre-cut that way you don't
have to do as much of the work which is
always the best I feel like that looks
really hue oh we need a drink
duh so we've got a glass from Ikea
because we're just that cool filtered
water because we're just that
we're putting strawberries in the water
be too much is there a thing called too
much that screams I'm healthier than you
so we have our water with ice cubes and
strawberries we have our bagel toes with
an egg that we will pop the oh but I
kind of ruined it by cooking it a little
bit anyways avocado the bagel and
cilantro not really because we're going
to eat it but just because it looks good
we have this random marble thing from
Anthropologie that's meant to like crush
garlic with a fake leaf we have this
cool triangular Bowl from Ikea with
peach yogurt in raspberry granola we
have a random ramekin full of cantle
pre-cut and we have some random cheese
on this really cool platter from TJ Maxx
if y'all wanted to hang out even the
lighting is like perfectly glistening on
the yogurt I'm such a weird person oh
not calculator alone camera okay so now
we're going to get up really really high
to take this picture and make sure you
got a good perspective good angle photos
let's see what we've done look at that
look how beautiful that is
wow we're pretty much professionals yes
