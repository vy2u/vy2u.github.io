lunch and then I also might go like on a
thrifting extravaganza today just
because I haven't in a while and I

have these here so you have a few of
them throughout yeah so if you live near
one of these places go highly recommend
it okay so here's what I got I get this

tzatziki because I really like their
taziki's sauce and then we get basil
hummus we get the same thing like almost
every time but it's so

today so right now we're at the thrift
store I found this skirt that has like
slits in it isn't that cool and then I
also found this Harley Davidson t-shirt
and I got some vintage Levi's I can't
find it thanks mom
yeah my mom got a lot of stuff she found
a champion hoodie she founded Javon Chi
hoodie
she found tons of stuff oh what a girl I
did get a belt too
this is the belt it's just gold and
white I thought it would be cute because
I don't have any white ones I only have
black belts the jacket that I bought
it's just like a black corduroy
oversized jacket would you like it
yeah we press up there dudes told you
you're welcome
so Chanel yeah yeah it has like a Chanel
vibe so so far I've gotten to coach but

will totally buy that mom I think I just
found the best shirt ever this is a real
thing you see that apparently apparently
they did I love it is that the new Dior
yeah Wow so I am now home from thrifting
and I'm gonna show you guys what I got
I'm really sad because I normally rack
up at the thrift stores you guys know
that I get really good stuff the first
thing that I got was the jacket you saw
me put on in the car it's like this
really big oversized corduroy jacket
I've been really liking quarter-way
lately so I thought that was really nice
I picked up the Harley Davidson
t-shirt as a guy section the best at the
thrift store and then I also picked up
this skirt how does it work okay so it's
like this nude and black colored stripe
and it has two slits in the front I
think it would be really good for like
honestly the beach obviously it's home
way too cold away this now and this
let's go up pretty high so this would be
something that's super cute to like just
throw over like a bathing suit or
something like that I got this bag I
thought it was so pretty my mom pointed
it out I like that it's like really
glossy and then it has like the gold
detail I got this coat I've been loving
this print I've been wearing it so much
and it's got this like thick white fur
on the inside so it's really really
thick so I know this is gonna like keep
you super warm I hope you guys enjoyed
