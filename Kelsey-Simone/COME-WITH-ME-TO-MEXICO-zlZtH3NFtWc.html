excited five o'clock in the morning and
I feel completely dead but I'm also like
really - excited at the same time the
first thing we do when we get to Mexico
is we're going to our hotel so yeah I
think the next time I'll see you is when
we get there so I have been in Mexico
for like thirty minutes in my hair is
already getting big this place is insane

do the rest of the tour like this okay
here we have the bathroom which oh my
lord just just take a minute look at
this shower we have our wardrobe here
and then this is like snacks and like
food and stuff witches perfect have my
own big bed which I'm really excited
about because I'm so tired because I
woke up at like 4:30 so I'm excited
we have a TV we have an eating area this
is so adorable we have a little like
lounge area this is the best part if I
could open the door look at this tub
it's outdoors there's like a lounging
area here is this not perfect and then
my view we have the ocean right there
which the beach is walkable it's
literally right there they have a couple
different pools but this is like the
quiet pool you can like there's like a
bar and you can like get snacks and
stuff in the pool there and then there's
another pool down that way I'm really
really excited but I'm starving I've not

famous striped top and my shoes I'm just

is a value so if you say I'm getting a
spider-man mode right now for a picture
