we're gonna have a lot of fun we're
gonna hang out today and guys have been
requesting me to vlog a lot and I only
have a really vlog when I'm like on
vacation or like doing something really
cool so I decided to just do like a
chill regular day in my life
we're gonna go to Dunkin Donuts cuz
we're gonna get breakfast my mom like
texted me
my family's order I don't really drive
by myself that often so this is kind of
scary but not really do you guys
remember when I did that video driving
with my dad and I had no clue how to
drive and I'm here for vlogging myself
driving this is like just as much of a
wreck but okay okay so I'm probably not
gonna vlog the drive cuz I feel like
that's a definitely thing to do so I'll
see you at Dunkin Donuts struggling but
I got the goods this is not sponsored by
Dunkin Donuts by the way the power of
God in anime really are by my side
because I literally just left the keys
in the car I left the keys in the car
somehow you can get locked out I mean I
never locked to the car but I just left
the keys in here I just left the keys in
here this is what you don't flog in
Drive kids don't blog and drive like I'm
serious do not blog and drive it I
always listen to worship music early in
the morning and get like super hype so
we're gonna do that right now we got
everything we didn't leave anything in
Dunkin Donuts just leaves my blog camera
and Dunkin Donuts that's so something I
would do
don't listen to words plate you're
missing out I'll link like the album in
the description on Spotify because I
want you guys to be blessed because it's
really good okay but we're home now so
right now what I'm doing is basically
just going through YouTube stuff so I
basically write down schedule-wise like
everything that I have to do and then I
have some video ideas because I'm
planning like or is it planning my next
couple of videos so I don't want to show
you that I also plan out my Instagram on
my vsco cam this video is going up on
Friday so I'll normally plan like the
next three videos so I'll typically know
what's going on Tuesday the next Friday
and the next Tuesday that's what I like
to do but it doesn't always work like
that I like to organize like what days
I'm filming what days I'm editing etc
anytime I write down like one to two
things in my planner I always feel like
such a like mature businesswoman I look
like I'm doing work but this is what I'm
actually doing later my mom and I are
gonna go out we're gonna take some
Instagram pictures we're gonna go food
shopping I think we're into Whole Foods
and we gonna like cook dinner
I need a tribal fun so we have a special
guest there we go oh you're so cute they
are baking chocolate chip cookies these
are definitely gonna be better than the
ones that me and Alice cooked in the
last cookie with Kelsey butter is an egg
there's literally instructions on how to
soften butter do you think I'm that
stupid we have our bowl you just say I'm
using this butter
it's um butter aunt you guys to see this
plop satisfying ready okay that wasn't
as satisfying him I thought it would be
one egg
here's the masterpiece I did it mom do
you want some cookies
I just like laughing at you always of
course moisturize I'm using fresh when
do I not she's just like my favorite in
the entire world now I'm gonna do
foundation as always by Laura Mercier
tinted aluminized CC cream it's kind of
like stick it on there it like
illuminates your skin which is so nice
like look that glow I don't have primer
on don't have highlighter on it then
we're gonna do concealer just do a
little bit like that
I'm not going it on the whole routine
I'm just going to do with my regular
everyday makeup look oh it is braids now
I look a little bit more put together
it's super bright here I did my makeup
like I said pretty natural just like an
everyday look I kept my hair and like a
little messy bun just because I didn't
really feel like doing my hair mom are
you ready I feel like we should look
nicer for the food store we're a little
casual
how pretty
I want to get these these are really
pretty so which one do we get this brush
that one yes
Oh
in front of the beads don't fight fire
I put my flowers in a little vase of
water we're gonna go cook dinner now
bread with salmon with arugula gotcha
bread which I totally forgot the aioli
oh yes I drilled asparagus by the way
we're recreating an actual thing this is
a sandwich I always get this place when
we go to the beach it was kind of like
wanting it we're going to take the
salmon we're gonna season it with lemon
juice olive oil sea salt pepper but
spread them in season these we're doing
the same it's salt and pepper but we're
also gonna put garlic on it too
my mom got kind of fancy again she made
the salmon look so bougie with onions
I'm gone perfect this is looking so good
look at that okay so I just finished
eating my dinner it was so good I'm
gonna keep up with that recipe because
that was amazing yeah I don't know I'm
probably just gonna clean up my room a
little bit um fix my fig Taner because
it's like almost all off by now but all
that stuff's boring and you probably
don't want to see that stuff so I am I
guess I'm just gonna end it here I hope
