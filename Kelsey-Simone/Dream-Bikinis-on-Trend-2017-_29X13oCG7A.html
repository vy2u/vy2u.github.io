kind of like a mix of two different
videos for you I'm going to be doing a
haul but all of the clothes that I'm
hauling are either like bikinis bathing
suits like sort of like beachy clothes
crop top stuff you throw on over a
bathing suit but I'm also be talking
about like the biggest trends for
bathing suits like swords like what's in
right now for Beach wear and stuff like
that and the haul is going to be try on
haul I'm only gonna be turn on the
clothes though not the bathing suits
because I'm a little on the conservative
side as usual I will have all the links
below to every product that I talk about
I know sometimes you guys always
complain that I talk about higher end
stuff and that I should talk about like
more like affordable stuff everything
that I have is from Zappos calm and
everything on there is super affordable
they have whole bikini sex for like
under 20 bucks there I really recommend
checking them out I actually drove haul
with them last summer and I really liked
everything they send me so I thought
would be a good idea to do another one
this year shoutouts is Apple for being
the true homie thanks for sending all
this gorgeous stuff so the first bathing
suit trend that I have kind of mixes the
first and second trend together but I
have them in both black and white you
know all the colors of the rainbow so it
is an off the shoulder top it has this
sort of like lacing up the front I know
every shirt in every dress right now has
this sort of like crisscross lacing on
it so having like regular fashion trends
in your bathing suits are so cute super
adorable and it has these really long
string that wrap all the way around your
torso and then you just like tie it in
the back so cute it just adds like this
detail that's just so gorgeous and they
come with just really simple bottoms you
got a lot of a simple bottom so the
rapine as' is really cute but the second
trend I am going to talk about is off
the shoulder I love strapless stuff
I'm literally scared that they're going
to like come off in the water but I feel
like when you have like these little
sleeve thingies it's just like a lot
more protection I don't know but this
one is a Stratus bathing suit which I
love wearing shirts in the summer I'm
like obsessed with this this is like
probably my favorite bathing suit out of
all of them I don't really know why and
then they have just regular little
striped bottom third turn there and
we're going to talk about is
high-waisted bottoms I feel like they're
really flattering as well so I have two
different types of high-waisted bottoms
the first
bathing suit that I have is this nude
one and they're also pretty conservative
I feel like for me where I don't wear
super cheeky extreme bikinis like this
is like still on trend and cute but it's
also going to cover you you know those
bottoms come with this new top it has
like a cage to back which I love like
sort of detailed backs it's really
pretty so the second high waisted
bathing suit that I have is this red one
I love red with the tan like red with
tan on looks so good name a more dynamic
duo so especially with the gold you will
really like a look at this and then it
has this more simple top just a red top
I love just simple tops because like I
love like accessorizing my bathing suits
or like their outfits I don't know I'm
weird on the extra so I really like this
one the next year I'm going to talk
about I'm so happy it is a trend I have
this velvet one-piece which who would
have thought and it's sort of this like
like a deli mustard color I'm really bad
at describing things but it has a really
low back which is actually my next trend
then like I said in the next trend I
have is like low back one-piece bathing
suits so I have a couple here the first
one that I have is like this gray color
sort of plunging back and I also got the
same one in a brighter sort of yellow I
feel like you know what it's summer
might as well get me a color too then I
got this white one which is a really
weird fabric I really like it it is all
scalloped which is super cute I have
some bathing suit bottoms like this and
I love it
um and then I have this one piece which
is like a really soft material it's
almost like a t-shirt material it feels
like but it laces up the front which
again the lace-up super cute and it's
really low in the back so again this is
adorable next thing I have is printed
bathing suits and I got a snakeskin
bathing suit I've been loving snakeskin
for fashion like in general their
regular bottoms and they have sort of
like three little strings on the side of
the break your little metal circles adds
a little bit of interest and then the
top is again that trust it suspect is
that triangular shape but the straps are
like these little three straps okay next
pool party I'm going to I'm wearing this
can someone invite me to a pool party so
this trend is just like tops that look
like sports bras like I love bathing
suits that have these like sport bra che
top like I think it's so adorable and
the bottoms just plain bottoms super
cute super simple I love this color this
sort of rusty burnt orange everyone
getting into color guys oh my god help
me the next term that I have was really
big last year and I still like it I
still think it's going to be really big
it's this whole sort of like woven thing
I know that these really really big last
year bottoms super cute super nice not
too cheeky the last bathing suit so I'm
just going to talk about are just more
like simple basic bathing suits but they
all have that triangular top shape which
I feel like is so flattering this one
I'm obsessed with I don't know if it's
just like the color and the bottoms are
Jess these are this this is actually the
same bathing suit as the red one just in
a different color and then I got the
same one and purple in the bottom
actually have this sort of like Z thing
going on I haven't won purple since like
the third grade so kind of excited to
try this out and then I have this again
the same sort of like triangular it's
upside down if it sounds really cool
because it's like outlined with this a
lilac color but it's like a white like
inside which is super cute I love this
one I think this one looks super summery
also has bottoms which look exactly the
same they sort of have this little
opening here just absolute detail to the
hip and on the Left bathing suit I have
before we go into like clothes is this
one goes all the way around the back so
it kind of has that sports bra thing but
it like looks like a triangular bathing
suit in the front black mesh over the
top which I know mesh is then super
on-trend like in the fashion world
lately in the bottoms so that is it for
the bathing suit portion of the haul the
first thing I'm going to talk about is
actually the top I'm wearing again got
it in black Asian didn't white it's like
this off the shoulder top which I again
wear tons of off the shoulder but I
actually have something under it it's
actually completely like open down the
middle I love the gold detail honestly
you can even leave this open if leave it
open like that like a little bathing
suit underneath I have these again black
and white these I wear this on vacation
and access this is an Instagram picture
and I was getting so many questions
about it so it's this little like
scrunchie off the shoulder with the
trend but it's a long sleeve which I
love I note all the people were asking
where I got this top so I believe it
went below next thing I have you see me
talk about this trend before I love
these four but not long striped shirts
so this one's actually made to be
addressed the material that it's made
out of is super thin so you're not going
to be hot drawing this on over actually
anything is so cute even with this top
and with more trends the whole scrunchie
thing but it's this red little gray
t-shirt they have these in a bunch of
different colors I just got gray because
I feel like the gray half of my closet
is a little locking it just has a scoop
neck super cute I feel like again with
the children I wear chokers with
everything guys you can just totally
ignore me um but yeah it's going to
around the sleeves and around the bottom
and then these I wore in my blog and I
did get a lot of questions about these I
know that there are a lot of like more
expensive brands doing this with the
whole like stripe thing down the Jean
for these ones were so inexpensive like
I'm serious guys you do not have to
spend money to get the trendiest cutest
clothes I'll say that right now I might
even make a video on this give this
video a thumbs up comment down below if
you want me to do like sort of like a
budget wise trendy video scenes are
super cute they're super stretchy like
they're so comfortable they're ripped at
the bottom which you know I love mama
love some ripped jeans they are
high-waisted super stretchy they look
good on my BJ everything you need in the
jeans this dress is actually a dupe for
another dress that I found that I really
wanted so I saw this subject at I
haven't worn it yet but they have these
little how cute this is oh my god like
this is not so adorable so the sleeves
are like these little leather cords with
like this metal collapse that attach the
straps and then it's like this plaid
which I never work plaid like I never
wear it stuff like this I got to sort of
slip dresses slip dresses are so in
right now so I decided to get this black
one it's dissolved it with lace detail
as well as down the bottom and then on
the sides it like opens on both sides so
it's not like a slit dress but on the
sides open if that makes sense and then
the second flip dress that I got is this
oh my god gorgeous color it's like this
brown but it has the lace detail at the
top as well and then it's like this
Ridge crushed velvet all the way down to
the
the bottom is just planes I just have
sunglasses and tapestry to show you
which I saw this sounds like I need that
for instagrams get it Add to Cart
so it is this circle tapestry and it's
all like white with these black stripes
and has these white little tassels
around the edges these are the ones I
wore that I got a lot of questions on
then on prescription you know love the
gold goes with the whole gold thing and
they're adorable they have the double
lined a little gold it's just so cute
and then the next thing that I have are
also gold they're just these sort of
like I don't know if these are
considered aviator style but I love the
bark off the top circular style shaped
love them and then I have these black
lines which these will be also
gratification I don't know if I showed
these in the vlog but I did wear these
and they have like the bar across the
middle bar across the top there sort of
like winged out like the other pointed
at the top which i think is really cute
I think too that flattering army last
pair of these are so cool I don't know
why I love you so much but they're so
cool how cool are those tell me I don't
look like I'm from like an 80s sci-fi
show they're a little big but I feel
like big sunglasses are like super cute
right now so that is everything is that
