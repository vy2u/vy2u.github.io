can today
I thought I would beautiful hey guys so
today I thought I would do a little hair
video for you guys because I haven't
done one in forever I thought I'd just
show you all of my go-to hair looks that
I wear either my YouTube videos are all
read them on Instagram I'm gonna be
showing you like all of them with my
curly natural hair like my straight
sleek looks because I wear that all the
time I'm gonna show you my sleek buns my
messy bun is how I like to do my beach
waves I'm gonna show you everything but
I'm not a hair professional so these are
super simple looks trust me they're very
easy to accomplish and they don't take
very long to do either everything takes
like 10 or 15 minutes so yeah we're just
gonna go through and show you all of
them I'm gonna start off with my
naturally curly hair which is why it's
in a tower right now because it's wet
and I also did want to mention it that
this video is not sponsored I feel like
every single year tutorial I watch on
YouTube is sponsored even most of mine
are sponsored I feel like we just needed
a fresh breath of not sponsoring
tutorials so here you go these are all
my honest tools that I use all the
products that I just love to use on my
hair everyday so basically what I like
to do with my curly hair rule number one
I do is air dry it I don't blow dry my
hair and I also don't like to leave it
in the towel to dry either because then
it gets really really big
micros will sort of and more regularly
and bigger so I like to air dry it that
way it's a little bit more tame and like
manageable to style while my hair is
still wet
I will scrunch a hair mousse in it the
one that I have is from dry bar this is
the southern belle volumizing mousse I
just like putting this a little bit in
my roots and in my and feel like this
makes my curls more tame while still
giving them texture at the same time so
if I don't want it like super big
voluminous and like spiral curls I'll
normally put this product when I just
want like a soak like a more tame hair
hair oil that I have is Orlando PETA
play and I'll put a hydrating hair
well in my end after its air dried this
is just sort of what it looks like
normally the way I'll style it down is
all just something leave it like this
basically yeah
I'll normally just flip it to the side
and wear it sort of messy like this this
is just kind of how I like to wear it
she kind of does her own things so I
just let her do that and I feel like
when I have curly hair is the best time
to have it up so I'm gonna do like a
little curly a messy bun and I'll show
you how to do that so I really like
using scrunchies for my messy buns I've
been obsessed with them lately I used to
hate them because I thought they made me
look like he's 5 years old but I've been
really liking scrunchies now you can use
a little regular hair type if you want
to I'm going to collect all of my hair
on the top of my head right here tight
over my hair not fully like I'll leave
the little ends out and then I'll twist
it around and bring it back around my
hair if that makes any sense at all and
then I just sort of pull all of the hair
like from my roots down so that it gets
really poofy and then I'll just play
around with it any pieces that are
sticking out too much I'll tuck in and
just sort of mess it up with my fingers
like this and pull it out of the
scrunchie a little so it doesn't always
look good on the first try sometimes
I'll do this actually like 15 times
before it looks good but I always feel
like it's easier to do with curly messy
hair I can never get a good messy bun
with straight hair so normally when I
have curly hair this is just like my
go-to thing to do but I do love a good
straight hair look as you guys know if
you follow me I always have sleek hair a
lot whether it's down or in like a sleek
bun so I'm gonna show you how to do that
next so now onto the more sleek straight
hair looks obviously the first thing I
need to do is straighten my hair this is
the straightener that I use it this is
the t3 straightener of course yes I was
kind of attracted to it because it's so
beautiful this is the most gorgeous hair
straightener or hair tool I've ever seen
before it's all white it has like
rhinestones on it and rose gold detail
but it's really nice for my hair it gets
to the perfect temperature that I need I
turn it like not to the highest but
right below the highest setting
and of course spray a little he
protected in there because you do want
to always protect your hair from the
heat
so I'll normally just run my
straightener through I'll take little
sections so once I'm done straightening
it I will brush my hair and I use this
like bamboo paddle brush then for the
number one product that I use for
sleeping my hair I swear it makes such a
big difference and it makes it look so
much better I use this way finishing
cream this stuff is amazing for sleeping
my hair I just sort of put a little bit
in my fingertips and then just press it
over the top of my head now you don't
want to use like a hair oil or anything
to put towards your roots because you
don't want your hair to look greasy and
oily and gross this finishing cream
completely dries like it doesn't look
greasy on your scalp but it'll still go
your baby hairs down it'll flatten all
of your hair and give it that sleek look
with a little bit of shine but no like
grease so it's amazing I will take a
spoolie brush or like I have like this
little clear brow gel that I use just
for my hair to stick all my baby hairs
down that's like my little life hack for
sticking down the front ends of your
hair and your baby hairs it's pretty
simple like I said it doesn't take very
long to do and then all of my other
sleek hair looks are really simple as
well so to do a sleek bun so I'll just
put it in a really low ponytail it down
at the nape of my neck and I'll tie that
really really tight because you don't
want any hair to like be loose or messy
so then I'm just going to twist my hair
around and then wrap it in a circle and
just bobby pin it it's actually that
simple and then I also wear sleep
ponytails which is the exact for just
first step of the bun just basically
tying it in a really really tight
ponytail at the nape of your neck just
tying it super tight and then I'll just
brush through it and that's about it for
my ponytail sometimes I just prefer the
ponytail with the bun if my hair is just
freshly straightened and I don't want to
like crimp it by having it in a bun all
day so those are about the only things
that I do with my straight hair so now
we're going to move on to my wavy hair
so
only when we do my hair I would have pre
straightened then because I can't do
beat Williams with like my natural hair
so I'll straighten it first and then
I'll wave it so I'll either wave it with
my straightener or I'll switch over to
my curling iron because they do give
different effects but sometimes that I'm
lazy I'll just use my straightening iron
so I'll show you how to do it with both
what I do is I leave the roots straight
you're going to want to leave your roots
straight and leave the tips of your hair
straight you're only going to want to
curl like this middle section if that
makes sense it's always easier for you
to see it than for me to explain it so I
will show you guys but you just
basically twist it around in a circle
and just pull it all the way straight
down it's really really simple it's
easier to do than it is to explain how
to do it so the curling one that I use
is the three-in-one from nume and I'm
going to be using the medium barrel the
smaller the barrel the tighter your curl
is going to be like the more curly it's
going to be so I'll normally either use
the medium or the large barrel so I'll
just take this wrap it around the center
portion of my hair and I'll even for a
very small amount of time I definitely
leave it on for less than 10 seconds
maybe only like six or seven seconds
um and then that's about it so once I'm
completely done waving all of my hair
the first thing I'll do is I'll take
this which is my living proof full drive
volume blast it just adds a little
bottom volume to your roots and makes
your hair just it gives it that really
nice beachy tousled look I really like
it
and then also what I've use is a sea
salt spray or like a beachy wave spray I
think using this one from way this is my
all-time favorite wave spray it doesn't
leave your hair super crunchy because it
does have oils in it which is really
nice and it's no lie the best-smelling
thing ever
I send thoughts if things are the
best-smelling thing but this is easily
top three the best smelling product I
own in my life so once I'm done waving
my hair I normally will just keep it
down either in a middle part or I'll
sweep it to the side it's sort of like
the same thing with my curly hair I just
let it go down and do its own thing and
let it have fun because it looks really
good
but another thing
to do with my wavy hair is wear hats I
don't know why but I feel like every
time I have really waiting pretty hair
and looks really good in packs so of
course the first time that I like
wearing is a beret I talked about this
in my trend alert video that I love
wearing berets this one is a great one
from Opening Ceremony and then also I
have beanies be these are the best wear
the winter because they keep your head
super worn and I also knew be a little
super cute this nude one is from Urban
Outfitters from the men's section I
think I just love this one I think it
looks really good and then I also wear
tons of baseball caps I normally wear
these the most in the summer but they
are still like you have to wear it
year-round this specific one that I have
I think it's from H&amp;amp;M and then for a my
very last oh look I love using these
bandana things it's like the same friend
does my pants I love doing ponytails
with my wavy hair as well so I'll
normally throw that up in a ponytail
I'll do it the same way that I showed
you with my curly hair I'll fold it into
a triangle so put the two corners
together and then I'll roll it all the
way up and then I'll tie it and like a
little just not around my ponytail and
let the long ends hang down I think it's
the most adorable look ever and getting
this sort of gives you those Parisian
vibes that I really really love it's
such a cute little detail to add to your
hair and I really have just started
loving doing this so those are all of
the hair looks that I have for this
video just all of my go-to looks I hope
that you guys enjoyed and I hope that it
