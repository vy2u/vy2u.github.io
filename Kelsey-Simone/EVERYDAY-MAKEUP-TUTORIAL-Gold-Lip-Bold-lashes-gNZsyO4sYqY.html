never this enthusiastic I'm no mind so
enthusiastic right now I definitely have
energy from this coffee this is not it's
not sponsored by the way so in today's
video I'm going to be doing like an
everyday makeup look
not everyday but just like a go to the
segment go to makeup look and I'm going
to do it sort of chitchat style the last
time I saw one of these it did really
good so I thought why not do another one
here we go got that glow as if you
haven't seen me highlight my face enough
on this channel okay so can we shine my
face I'm using the fresh sea berry
mmm-hmm I'm using the fresh sea very
moisturizing face oil this stuff smells
really good and it's just really nice
I'm just going to rub that all over my
skin because it is thirsty so now that
we're mooster eyes I'm going to go in
with a primer and for primer I'm going
to use the foundation primer from Laura
Mercier like second this is how we do it
I think so how was your day guys I swear
this is not sponsored or anything but
Laura Mercier is Heike becoming my
favorite makeup brand like every single
time I travel in their products I'm
never disappointed for my foundation I'm
going to use the Laura Mercier flawless
fusion ultra long wear foundation I
normally use a tinted moisturizer the
illuminating one that's still my
favorite foundation like that one I use
all the time but they just sent me this
one this is like the new one I don't
know if this is out yet or not I haven't
seen it in my Sephora is a super like a
so lawless finish foundation but I like
for the summer very like light then kind
of like a continuous char there so I'm
going to mix it with my Mac strobe cream
and gold light is it just going to like
give it glow but it's also going to like
send out the consistency a little bit to
make it more like a tinted moisturizer a
little bit
my stroke cream and then a little of the
foundation I'm trying to show you at the
same time okay now we're just gonna put
this all over the face I'm going to use
a flat top kabuki brush to blend this
out this is my favorite foundation brush
I've used this in a couple makeup
tutorials this is from ELF
and this is just like their they
actually say it's a powder brush but I
just use this to blend in my foundation
hold up just kidding and stop the video
mmm
we need to have a conversation really
quick if you've watched my videos you
know that my favorite primer is the Too
Faced hangover the coconut primer right
to face actually came out with a
hangover setting spray this is the thing
this is like a thing now I don't have
words for again this is not bothered I
just I've never been this excited of how
to make of products before in my life I
like to spray it on the brush then blend
away I have like a little bit of a
loving tangle going on down here so I
need to like match it to my net because
I don't put tanner on my face mixing it
with a strong cream was a good idea do
you see that glow these two are totally
like a dynamic duo I really like it
right now I'm gonna move on to concealer
and I'm going to use this little large
Percy is absolutely the cutest thing
ever this little pop concealer it's
called the secret concealer and I'm just
gonna use this on my under eyes like
using too much I only sweat it off
throughout the day that's gross sorry
I'm going to use a more like bigger
fluffy brush to blend this out and also
bring it across my eyelids because my
eyelids are like super veiny
and then I'm going to set that with
again a my one and only YSL powder I
know this is like a little bit on the
light I am like booty side but it is
very worth it's the only powder I use
I'm just using the same brush because
lady and I'm just going to sort of pack
that on just my lids and my under eyes
is where I put the concealer just to
keep it from creasing and this powder
not only does it like that but it's also
going to like highlight as well so it
has like little tiny highlighting
not to where it's like glittery but you
know it's just going to like brighten up
my under eyes as you can see it sort of
like did that and it's very
aesthetically pleasing now that like the
main sort of like skin is done I'm going
to move on to bronzer let me use my Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm going
to use this huge brush this little Marc
Jacobs like face and body bronzing brush
but it is so nice so I was going to like
play music while doing this because I
was like I don't know what to talk about
like it's a chitchat video so I'm going
to play music that would be weird
because while I'm talking like I'm going
to have to pause it every time I have
something to say because I'm going to be
able to hear you over the music so
there's no music I'm sorry
so I hope you guys have been enjoying
all of my travel blogs recently if
you're new on this channel hello
recently I've listed some travel vlogs
because I've been traveling a lot and
I'm actually doing another one I'm going
to Mexico at the end of the month I was
going to film like another video while I
was in Mexico and I wasn't really sure
like besides the blog what I should do
so if you have any cool ideas leave them
in the comments because I need some
ideas I'm going to use the same exact
bronzer just with a more tapered small
brush this one's from Sephora this is my
favorite also I like to take this under
my lip yes Alex nice okay so I'm going
to do blush I forgot a blush brush
reaches Oh true outfit exposed for my
blush I'm using the pink leopard from
Too Faced I think this is actually like
a bronzer I'm not even sure but it's
pretty pink tell them to sell it's
pretty very subtle very light and it's
still like a bronzer so it like mixes
and you know on my highlight I'm going
to be using this sleek palette if you
are looking for a really good look
inexpensive highlighting palette get
this this is a precious metal
highlighting College it has it has three
cream highlighters and then it also has
like a powdered highlighter I'm going to
be using deep okay I'm going to be using
the color I'm using this one I think
it's either a royal gold or renaissance
gold I'm not sure which one when I take
my little Pat McGrath highlighting brush
and just sort of swirl that in there
and
super subtle it's like Dewey that's
pretty that's really pretty like a light
sort of just champagne hello oh my god
did you see that look at that
what you're a big mutation okay well now
my lip just looks a little low much but
wow that is crazy pigmented on your
finger holy crap that's a lot I really
love highlighting the tip of my nose I
don't know why I think it's really
adorable Junie Josh oh yes so we're done
with like the face makeup not going to
move on to my eyebrows I just sort of
brush all the hair straight up they have
clear brow gel and then I'm going to use
my up okay I'm going to use my on Asajj
of evidence brow pencil to fill my
eyebrows in I don't know why I can't
talk I keep like starting a sentence and
then completely forgetting what I'm
going to say so I get so many questions
how I fill in my eyebrows actually like
nobody cares how old my eyebrows I
basically just make like a line
underneath and then sometimes I'll bring
a little bit up in the front just
because they're like a little bit more
sparse to the front but I just make a
line underneath and then I blend that
out and conceal like I don't really I
don't really do too much so I just make
like a light line underneath my eyebrows
like that's it like I just make like a
line underneath like the shape that I
want and then I'm just going to use this
this is just like leftover foundation
from mixing it I'm just going to clean
them up underneath that's the brow look
I want to like scoop the camera closer
but this lens doesn't have the boom on
it it's a set lens i'm going to do i
shadow and i normally really don't do
that much eye shadow I'm going to do it
really like this palette we need to talk
about this palette I highly recommend
that you go violet it's like right now
add-to-cart go open link in the bio yeah
I'm just going to let you like look at
it for a thing can we talk about how
free that is it's so pretty and it's all
the colors that I love I'm going to take
this little like round crease brush and
I'm going to use this color it's going
to put this in my crease very lightly
step
watch let's split it in half there we go
that's it right in the outer corner of
my lid pretty much all I do for
eyeshadow when I'm like doing my go-to
look is just like a neutral bra in my
crease and all my lot of wash line
that's about it
so then I'm going to take like this
little pencil brush I'm going to take
this color like this darker Brown and
I'm just gonna put that underneath my
lash line this mirror is like huge by
the way it was so it looks a little
weird right now but wait till I put
lashes on I'm going to take my benefit
roller lash which is that my favorite
mascara recently okay so there it is
this eye look with mascara on so
something I've been doing recently that
tons of people always ask me questions
off so I like to use we get them ok so I
like to use I normally will use the
Ardell the demi wispies lashes I'm
pretty sure that's what they're called
so I'll take my eyelashes and I'll cut
them in half so I don't really like the
way that the whole entire eyelash looks
on my eye I just like some sort of like
wispier and longer at the ends of my eye
I don't obviously do this every day this
is just like my go-to look gotta wait
for them flashes to dress all the sudden
coming back out yes hello hello come
back I need you I'm filming I'm going to
get really up-close and personal with my
mirror real quick I might be like a
little out of focus right now but ok ok
so that's what it looks like it's not
like that huge the difference but it
does make that little bit of a
difference that I really like to sort of
get that little flirty with Venus to the
eyes just yeah that's what it does okay
so lashes are finally on there we go
that's what they look like I really like
the way that this looks I feel like it's
really flattering on my eye shape I
really like it so now we got a do I have
like a weird mixture that I came up with
last night that I was like oh my god
let's do this so I wanted to wear this
color but it's like super intense I'll
show you this is for Mac this is the
bronze shimmer it has like a frost
finish look at that gold oh my god
it's kind of intense all day I don't
like literal gold list
so I put this down first a sort of like
a concealing babe taking this buxom in
the colored Marrakesh and this is just
going to sort of be like my I'm going to
line my lips with this as well it's just
like this really pale natural nude shade
and this smells amazing it's just sort
of like mutes down in the gold so that's
not so crazy intense
I love glosses i love double glossing
right now so when I take this honest
Agia lip gloss and the color excuted and
just sort of put that on top look that's
the lip gloss over here and then that's
the lipstick there are really pretty duo
every day go to lip colors I normally
use is just like a clear gloss like I
have the little Dior Maximizer ones that
are just sort of clear they don't really
have any pigmentation that's normally
what I go for but I thought that was
going to be kind of boring for this
tutorial like I wanted the lips to pop
it's just arms like a natural face of
natural eyes just pretty lashes so I was
like let's do like a really pretty nude
color because Newt is normally my go-to
clothes like it's still about you but
this combination I don't think a crazy
combination with who's going to wear
three lip colors every day but if you
really want a nice bold lip highly
suggest to this it's really nice and
then of course my lover we're going to
spray but yeah this is the finished look
this is just something like my go-to
makeup look with like a really cool gold
lip yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
