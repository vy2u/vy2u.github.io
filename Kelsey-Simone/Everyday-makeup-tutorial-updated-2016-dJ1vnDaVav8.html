filming I broke my thumbnail off and
like I was too lazy to like actually fix
it so I just put some like same color
polish over it honestly like like so
tragic hey guys so today I am going to
be showing you this um basically you
guys requested an everyday makeup
tutorial um this is not like a total
like everyday everyday makeup tutorial I
don't normally wear this much makeup
everyday my everyday makeup would
probably just be like foundation
eyebrows mascara and like some bronzer
but this is like an amped up everyday
makeup routine um just kind of the
makeup I wear in my selfies and my
youtube videos um because that is the
makeup that you guys do see if you want
to know how I get my face to look like
this um yeah I will see you guys and
like like like right now so starting off
with a clean face my eyebrows not so
cute right we need to we need to fix
those so on the first thing yep before I
even prime my face I moisturize my face
because it is winter and my skin is
really dry and I feel like when my face
is just moisturized and it looks good
then my foundation looks good is the
rose argon body conditioner from lush it
is an amazing moisturizer I literally
apply this religiously as if like it
were foundation like it's literally a
part of my makeup routine
I honestly probably moisturize my face
like two two sometimes three times a day
um I'm kind of crazy okay so to prime my
face I have a sample of the Smashbox
photo-finish I'm going to use I normally
use like the maybelline baby skin primer
but I ran out of it so now we're going
to do foundation I'm using my Mac
Foundation and I don't use this every
day um but it is full coverage so it's
good for like being under the lights and
like taking pictures of my face so I'm
just using my Beauty Blender to apply it
all onto my face
okay so now moving on to concealer I
kind of mix two different concealers
together I mix my mac studio finish
concealer in NC 20 with my NYX concealer
in porcelain
just because I like the coverage of this
concealer and has amazing coverage but
but this is my actual lit concealer
color and so for highlight I use the
next concealer so I kind of like mix
these two together and then apply that
so I just take my concealer brush and do
little triangles and I can't really
bring my triangles like all the way down
like most people do because I do have
freckles so I try to make them like as
short as possible but like while still
covering and like highlighting the whole
under eye area and what I do if you have
um freckles is I take the bottom of my
Beauty Blender like the part that like
doesn't have any makeup on it that's
totally just clear sponge and I sort of
like sponge away the excess makeup in a
way you'll see what I do it in a minute
I'm just going to sponge that all out
just fold so now that I was talking
about with the bottom of this sponge is
I basically just go over like the parts
of my face that have a lot of freckles
and just sort of like get some of the
excess foundation and concealer off of
them now I'm taking my NYX HD studio
powder my just translucent powder and
I'm going to be setting my under eyes so
I'm basically just going to use my
Beauty Blender to put it on and I'm just
going to leave it on my under eyes arm
while I do my eyebrows I also like to
put it right underneath where I contour
um that is something I never used to do
but I recently started doing because it
makes my contour look so much better so
now for the Holy Grail
my eyebrows so for brow product I use my
dip brow pomade from Anastasia in the
color dark brown and then I have from
Coastal Scents just this little like
angled brush that I use I like to use a
spoolie brush first but I left mine um
at a friend's house good job Kelsey but
so basically what I do is how I do my
eyebrows let's let's talk about this for
a minute
so basically um I do the bottom half
before I do the top half and what I like
to do is I basically draw an outline
from my eyebrow and then fill it in if
that makes sense
still it's been like probably 20 minutes
now okay so now I'm going to take a big
fluffy brush and just wipe all this off
okay so now moving on to bronzer and
highlighter I'm going to take my Mac
contouring palette I'm going to be using
the shades sculpt as well as bone I kind
of just mix those two sheets together so
as I take to sculpt it's the lightest
bronzer and I just sort of like bronzed
up the areas I'm going to go on tour
with a bigger fluffy brush and then I
take like a more tapered brush and I
just kind of go in the same spots and so
now I'm going to take a more tapered
brush like this and dip it in the
slightly darker color
hi late I'm going to be using my Too
Faced candlelight glow and a fan brush
I'm only going to be using the white
side
now that we're finally done the face I'm
going to move on to my eyes because I
look a little crazy so for mascara I'm
going to not yet I'm going to be taking
this naked to a shadow brush um and just
putting this in my crease I'm taking two
different Too Faced eye shadows teddy
bear and Velvet Revolver which are
basically just like totally bronzy
shades so gonna take the darker one up
to two and sweep that along my bottom
lash line now for mascara I use my Too
Faced better than sex mascara this is my
top favorite mascara for high end um
best mascara ever doesn't clump full
like full lashes like amazing um super
black this video isn't sponsored by Too
Faced but like hey hit me up and there
we go
mascara done the best and my favorite
part of the makeup yes now what I'm
going to do is lips um in Instagram post
selfies all the time you always ask me
like what lip products I use I'd use
different ones all the time so I picked
out a couple of like my most used selfie
worthy nude lipsticks because it's
pretty much all I wear and I'm gonna
show them to you the first lipstick I
have is my most recent favorite and my
newest like obsession you can say is
this NYX um color in that don't really
know how to pronounce that it is just
this really pretty nude lipstick I'm
probably going to use this one now but
it is not matte which is crazy because
go in out of the box there I always use
matte lipsticks another one is this NYX
matte lipstick in the colour butter and
it's basically just the mat slightly
darker version of the last lipstick like
they look pretty much the same just this
one's matte and like I said slightly
darker just repeated myself that's cute
this has been a fave for a while it's
the Too Faced melted melted nude and
literally with us all the time this one
is a lot more oranjee toned than brown
tone unlike the other ones and for some
lip liners sometimes
I won't just outline the lip and then
put lipstick sometimes I'll fill in the
lips with these and then just totally
use this as my color so I have NYX in
the color nude pretty easy and then I
have a Mac in etc and subculture I love
both of these so those are my favorites
and then I'm going to use this today
I really hoped you guys enjoyed this
