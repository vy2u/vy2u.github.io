today I'm really excited because we're
gonna call up some fellow youtubers so I
was inspired by those videos you see all
over now where it's someone doing
someone else's makeup tutorial and I
thought why instead of just watching
their tutorial how about my face time
some beauty grooves and have them tell
me what to do I don't know how this is
going to turn out because I didn't give
them any instruction at all I have like
my base done I have my foundation primer
concealer just cuz I thought that part
was like a little boring I didn't I want
to like skip over that I have the
giggles now I always get the giggles ha
ha ha oh my god you look so pretty your
lighting is better than mine your
lighting is better than mine and I have
a ring light oh good idea
ok so how are you everybody this is
summer okay so you're the first
contestant on the Kelsie show so okay so
basically you're in charge of three
steps be as creative as you want you're
gonna do contour highlight and blush
like I'm I have all my makeup so
whatever your creative summary brain can
think of that's why I'm doing this cuz I
was like I need to step out of my box
what shade should I use I have morning
light and ultra light like the Sephora
ones this one's like more like pearl and
this one's like gold yes we do the milk
one or we have the Rihanna one or
okay I want you to try to use a liquid
blush because for me that's the hardest
I literally never I never used liquid
blush because it scares me girl
okay look at this color Mac 130s okay
cool beans cool beans okay so how was
your day girl or well technically you
just woke up right see the thing is like
I'm not a mega professional sells like
maybe if I call didi grooves and like
bill hound don't know what you even this
video
yeah I like this one a lot and it's like
affordable it's only like nine dollars
thank you so much thank you for your
help
you look beautiful have a beautiful day
I look a little bit sunburned but maybe
we're just going for that fresh summer
look you know summer summer ha I mean it
adds a lot of life in color to my face
which I never have so that's great
sister hi you look beautiful it's not
good morning to me it's like 3:30 good
morning thank you the blush is a little
bit wild don't mind it okay okay so I
saved a specific part for you cuz I was
like you need to do this part you're in
charge of doing my brows okay good I've
glitter glue is that okay no no I'm not
like a professional beauty guru Queen I
don't just have glue sticks how well
I'll do the pretty one first on-camera
with you and I can go look for a glue
stick cuz I probably have one somewhere
in my house and I'll do that one show
okay starting from the middle you don't
my brows used to look like James you
followed me on instagram for a while so
you remember how terrible
so oh okay it was like
yeah okay I never brush got it God you
can seal on top too or just underneath
never yeah I never do that I use I used
to and it looked so bad and then I
stopped got the powder laura mercier
okay yay I like it Greco along
periodically time it's literally been
almost an hour I finally did find one
and it was completely like dried up and
gross so we're just gonna do a glitter
brow instead you said right that's what
I'm thinking like that looks pretty like
intense I feel like I have mayonnaise on
my eyebrow
oh my gosh
it looks like I bleached my brow more so
than I like shaved it off but hey that's
still fun okay I'll talk to you later I
love you yeah um so don't mind oh thank
you thank you so much um yeah James made
me bleach my brow which is why that took
so long to call you you are actually in
charge of the eyeshadow look I shadow an
eyeliner eyeshadow an eyeliner
yeah I do yeah I wait liquid actually
perfect that's perfect okay oh yeah I do
in the Helen actually okay so how was
your lunch by the way right I was
inspired by you know how people do the
like following so-and-so's making
tutorial but I was like instead of just
following someone's tutorial like what
if I called the beauty gurus themselves
and had that tell me what to do you do
not look like a little boy shut up
so olivia is definitely a girl you guys
just in case you were wondering so hot
pink on the inner corner you said yeah
okay we're going for hot pink it was
like an infection I don't true it does
it's looking pretty good
the next person your answers and photos
can be I know I'm looking more stupider
or that as stupid more stupid by the
minute there we go okay see I pulled it
out more so that the infection looks
like it's spreading yeah it looks great
thank you for putting your your input
here yeah no problem it looks great I
think the inner corner ties in with the
too much blush I love it okay thank you
bye we're calling Coco I'm ready for her
reaction I'm so ready
so yeah you got to do it you get to do
the lashes so I know I feel like that's
gonna make it look like less scary like
lashes like rhinestones on the line I
have the Camille one's very natural yeah
I know
definitely the lashes of like helped
they've helped I'm trying to hold my
hair back girl no it's like an actual
like makeup head wrap fresh David oh
we've got one rhinestone down in the
middle so far yeah way better
and then we just have the lips to do
very high fashion don't I doesn't it
great
so you're the last person we've got
going on you're in charge of the lip so
get creative I do how was Paris by the
way I seriously I wish I could have came
to you with Paris okay you know Amanda's
like a true best friend she called me
and she was like so in like two days do
you want to go to Paris with me I'll
like the one right there
okay yeah I can use this then Wow the
finished look I love you okay so this is
the finished look you know we've gotten
a little bit gothy down here with a
colorful eye it balances it out overall
the finished look this is definitely not
what I expected to come out looking like
um but this is what the beauty gurus
wanted I literally don't even know how
to say it's not I'm like trying to make
it seem better like I'm like it's not
that bad but I mean this was a lot of
fun so thank you to everybody who was in
this video and who collaborated and who
was patient with me and my bad timing
