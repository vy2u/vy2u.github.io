showing you how to do this makeup look
I'm so happy and excited to be partnered
with both covergirl and Cosmopolitan
magazine to bring you this full makeup
tutorial all the products are by
covergirl though this whole face is
covergirl everybody showing you how to
achieve the look and I'm also using one
of their brand new palette I so you get
like a sneak peak on the palette all the
links for all the products that I use
the video will be down below so I'm
going to be using the nudes palette
which is one of my favorite eye palette
is actually won an award in Cosmopolitan
for sexiest makeup product hi Kelsey I'm
Lea wire from Cosmopolitan thanks so
much for having me on your channel
I chose covergirl true Naked shadow
palette in nudes to win the 2016 Cosmo
Beauty award for sexiest palette I love
that this product has eight highly
pigmented shades that you can use alone
blend together or smoked out I'm so
excited to see what you can do with this
palette to create your glam makeup look
I feel like it's a super classic look so
I'm going to show you how I did it so
the first step is obviously to start off
with a fresh face no makeup on for the
first product I'm going to be using is a
covergirl primer primer is really
important don't forget primer and this
is the covergirl trublend face primer
what I like about this primer is they
actually have it for whatever skin type
you are so if you have oily skin
combination skin dry skin they have a
primer for your type which is really
good so obviously I'm going to be using
the dry skin because I have dry skin all
over my face I just use this the same
way you would a moisturizer and just rub
it in now that I'm did my primer I'm
gonna put on my foundation or foundation
I'm using the covergirl clean sensitive
liquid foundation I'm in the color soft
honey I'm not fully into light on my
winter shade yet I'm normally probably a
lot lighter than this but I still do
have a little tiny bit of a tan left
over from the summer and then I'm just
going to blend it in with my brush I
like this foundation because it doesn't
cover up my freckles which is really
important to me a lot of foundations
tend to cover up my freckles because
they're like super full coverage I don't
like that because I don't want to cover
up my freckles I want to like even out
my skin tone but not hide all my
freckles but just always blend down to
your neck because you don't want to be
that girl now that I actually have color
on my skin
now I actually don't have a lot of like
blemishes on my skin or really bad under
eyes so I normally either don't use
concealer
or just double up with my foundation but
obviously this is the part where you
would take your time to do your
under-eye concealer I just put a little
bit under my eyes that's about it this
foundation I don't think you need to set
I mean I'm not setting it if you want to
set your foundation go ahead
drive a really nice on my skin it gives
sort of a dewy look but it's not like so
greasy to the point where you need to
set it if you have oily skin i would
suggest setting it with the powder but I
have dry skin so setting it with a
powder would make it look dry which is
not good so I'm not going to set it with
a powder but if you want to we'll go
ahead for my eyebrows I'm going to be
doing literally the easiest thing ever
I'm going to be taking their covergirl
professional natural lash this is
actually just clear brow gel and I'm
going to be putting this on my eyebrows
I'm going to do the natural bra look
today because I really want to focus on
my eye makeup moving on to the rest of
my face makeup I'm going to be using the
true blend contour palette from
covergirl and this is great has two
different contouring will contour and
bronzer and then it has a highlighting
shade for the highlighter I'm going to
take the same brush I use to just blend
out my concealer and I'm just going to
go ahead and dip that in there and then
I'm just going to start to apply this
look at that so I go down the bridge of
my nose and get like a lot on the tip of
my nose my Cupid's bow because that
makes your lips look a little bit more
plump on the top of your chin and then
obviously you have to get the cheekbones
yes this is my favorite part of doing
the makeup this is really nice I love
cream based highlighters I'm going to
take the contour shape I'm going to put
this right in the places that I would
contour or bronze so to blend out my
contour I just sort of going back and
forth motions like this I don't want to
keep the contour sharp so I just sort of
blend in place and just keep blending
until you feel like it just looks good
so blend until you feel like it looks
good and then to finish up my face
makeup I'm going to use a covergirl
blush this is a classic color blush in
the color natural glow it okay it's a
really natural just like peachy tone
blush I normally don't wear a lot of
blush because my cheeks are naturally
really rosy and they will get more rosy
throughout the day if I do our blush
it's something a little bit more natural
like this I'm just going to dot it on
like the apples of my cheeks that's just
going to add a little bit of color to my
face make my skin look more lively so no
one
fun part now we're going to do the eye
makeup so I'm going to start with
actually my favorite palette the
covergirl true naked nudes palette I
love this palette it has every color I
can ever desire and use I don't wear a
lot of bright colors so this palette is
perfect for me they're all really
flattering colors for literally any eye
shades so I feel like you can never go
wrong with like a really good neutrals
palette there's a like a whole range of
shadows from dark to light like whether
you want to go for a darker look or a
lighter look like you have your colors
and these colors are actually really
really pigmented I don't have many
drugstore eyeshadow palettes I get all
like I honestly think this is the only
one I have because this one's really
pigmented I like how bright the colors
come out and I really like how smooth
they are to blend this is definitely
like a go-to palette just for the first
step I'm going to use the little
applicator that comes in here I'm going
to use the first color and here's a nice
cream color and it's really shiny buff
sham oiz I'm probably going to say a lot
of the names of these wrong because
they're kind of interesting names but
hey so I'm just gonna place the really
light color all over my lid this is just
going to give a little bit of shimmer
I feel like lighter colors always open
up your eyes like look how pigmented
that is look at it and then just blend
it across your eye so blend that up all
the way till about where it hits your
crease then I'm going to take this
third-to-last shade right here it's just
the sort of matte dark brown color which
is called Coco Coco Coco Coco okay I'm
just gonna take a regular fluffy crease
brush and I'm going to take this color
and put it right in my crease this is
going to give dimension to your eye so
I'm just gonna use a windshield wiper
motion and just keep blending this in my
crease also a little trick that I do is
I'm going to put a little bit more on
the brush and I'm actually going to make
a little slightly visible not super
visible not crazy line from the outer
corner of my eye to the tip of my
eyebrow don't worry about this being too
neat I normally clean it up to the end
with like concealer and just connect
that to the crease like I said it's got
to look really messy at first like it
always does you can use tape for this if
you want I'm not a big fan of tape I
normally just conceal underneath it's
going to do this with the same shadow
with the same crease shadow and then
just blend it into the crease I'm
probably starting to look crazy but it's
okay it always looks crazy before it
gets better then I'm going to start to
take the second-to-last shimmery more
Brown rusty color and this is called
coffee
Caffe so far the easiest name I'm going
to take the same brush load it up on
there and I'm going to put this in the
outer V which is this outer the corner
I'm going to place it in here and then
just go in circular motions and just
sort of work that into the crease this
is just going to add more depth and just
sort of darken and warm up the eye look
a little bit more so I'm going to take
this brush again and I just have some
foundation on the back of my hand and
I'm just going to clean this up blending
that out look and it's like you had tape
on the whole time see how sharp that is
then take any super small pointed
eyeshadow brush that you like and we're
going to take OCO cafe color and I'm
just going to brush this along the
bottom lashline until about half or
three-quarters of the way of the eye I
don't really like to bring it all the
way into the inner corner then I'm going
to be taking this palette so this is the
new covergirl palette this is the true
Naked Jules palette so it has eight
shades just like the nudes palette but
these are all jewel tones
so there's highlighting tones there's
crease colors there's pops of colors
that you can use on your lid and then
there's dark tones again this basically
has everything you would need so I love
mixing and matching these can totally do
so many different I looks with this so
these are just as pigmented as the nudes
palette they're really easy to blend it
definitely has the same quality I mean
ready this blue we're just gonna look at
that like there's such an affordable
palette again I'm going to take the
little applicator comes with I'm going
to take this this is the color Sunstone
it's just like this really pretty
metallic champagne color and I'm gonna
pop this all on the bottom of the lid in
the inner half of the lid and we're just
going to blend this into the crease
color that we have you do want to make
sure you blend it so that it's not a
harsh line and then the other side we're
going to take the first white color this
is the shade pearl and it is a super
pearly pearl was the right color name
we're going to use this to highlight our
brow bone okay so now living onto
eyeliner and lashes so we don't look so
weird anymore so now I'm going to take
the covergirl intensify me liquid liner
in the color 300 intense black I like it
because it's super skinny and has like a
perfect point so you can hold it just
like a pencil it's super easy to use
also like this because it dries really
quickly which is great and the way that
the tip is but it's a really cool tip
it's sort of like an oval so you can use
it
for thicker liner and then turn it on
its side and you can get super thin
liner I think it's a cold invention I
don't have any eyeliners like this so
I'm just gonna do a thin line across my
top lash line just to make my lashes
appear thicker when I put on my mascara
hey doing eyeliner on camera like it's
literally the hardest thing ever so now
to pull the whole ilyich together we're
gonna put on some mascara this is the
covergirl so lash you blast pro as a
three-in-one Multiplier brush to
maximize your lashes make them look
super bulb which I love because I that
little wimpy lashes and I need a really
great mascara to make them look like
falsies which this does no matter what
type of lashes you have this will work
on your lashes whether you have short
fair lashes or even if you have like
really good long lashes this will work
perfect and the brush is really cool it
has this fancy like ball tip brush which
really helps you get in there and get
your lashes really flirty and really
wispy and makes them look like false
lashes so I'm just going to go ahead and
apply two coats of this on my top lashes
and then apply some on my bottom lashes
the ball tip also really helps you get
like in the corner and the outer corner
of your lashes because I feel like
that's always so hard to do with certain
lash brushes okay doesn't it now just
looks so much better than I have mascara
on so now all we have left is the lips
you wouldn't be a fall makeup look
without a deep red so I'm going to be
using the covergirl lip stick in the
color euphoria 315 and this is just like
a super whiney deep red color this
lipstick super smooth and easy to apply
and it smells really good which I like
and then I'm terrible at putting on
lipstick so I normally have to clean it
up that's it so I feel like this is just
a super classic fall log just a warm
toned I look and then a darker lip and I
don't normally wear red lipsticks like
what have you ever seen you wear red
lipstick but I really like the way that
this color looks on me so that is it for
