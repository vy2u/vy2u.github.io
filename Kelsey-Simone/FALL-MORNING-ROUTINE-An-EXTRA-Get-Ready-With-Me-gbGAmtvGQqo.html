to be getting ready together
of course my typical morning does not
start off looking this perfect I decided
just to do a more glamorous version of
my fall morning routine so I'll
typically just jump out of bed and open
up my blinds right now I'm wearing this
really adorable white two-piece silk set
from my mum made it but because it is
the fall time it's normally really cold
in the morning so I decided to just put
my robe on it's this really white fluffy
soft one and then I'll head over to my
bathroom
in the bathroom of course I do all of
the typical things you would regularly
do in the bathroom as well as a little
bit of my skincare routine
the first thing I'm just gonna do is
wash my face I'm using the fresh soy
cleanser this is the cleansing milk I
really like this one
I'll just swirl that around my face with
some water just a really deep clean my
face in the morning and to sort of just
wake me up and make me feel more fresh
after I wash my face I will tone my face
right now I'm using the fresh peony
toner I normally use the rose toner but
this is one of the newer ones that they
sent me it smells beautiful it has a
super floral e scent and again it's
really nice in the morning just sort of
like invigorating and its really nice
and cold just to smooth out all over
your face right when you wake up
now I'm gonna head back to my room for
my daily devotional and little Jesus
time I love doing this I just feel like
it gets me in such a good mood in the
morning and I just I love Jesus so I do
daily devotionals from Joyce Meyers I
feel like they're the best ones I'll
leave the link below if you guys want to
use them as well I'm just it's my
favorite website and then also I'll play
some worship music probably Bethel I've
been having an obsession with Bethel
lately I've been listening to tons of
their worship music but I'll just sort
of let this play throughout the whole
getting ready process so I'll start with
my skincare routine right here I'm using
this Luna face oil from Sunday Riley or
I'll just use any moisturizer and then
I'll go on to eye cream I've been loving
this black tea eye cream from fresh and
then I'll also use my little gold metal
eye roller from Dior it's super cold and
it just really helps deep huffing my
eyes I love it and then I'll use this
lip mask from fresh I've been using this
everyday it makes your lips so so soft
and it's a really great to use right
before you start your makeup
of course I'm gonna finish off the
skincare with some rose water and then
I'm gonna go straight into my makeup I'm
not gonna show you the whole routine but
I'm just applying some concealer here
this is the Becca illuminating concealer
and I'm just blending that in with a
fluffy brush of course we got to have a
glowy skin so I'm using the Sunbeam from
benefit it's more of like a liquid sort
of golden highlight I'm gonna bronze my
face with this cream Chanel contour and
a Sonia Kashuk little contouring brush I
love this brush it's so good for getting
a really nice precise bronze I haven't
been wearing much color on my lips
lately I really just been liking this
glossy a clear gloss and then I'll
finish off with some more setting spray
and this is just sort of my natural
everyday sort of glowy makeup look and
then I'll head into my hair I'm gonna do
my typical sleek hair look that I've
been doing so much I'm gonna brush my
hair and part it in the middle and just
sort of pull it all the way to the back
just brushing it all the way down once I
feel like it's been brushed out and it's
sleek enough then I'll go into using my
way this is my finishing cream it sort
of just like helps all of the little
baby hairs stick down to the top of your
head without making your head look
greasy I'd never put hair oil on the top
of my head because it just doesn't look
as good I'll put hair oil at the bottom
and then use this finishing cream at the
top so for the hair oil for my ends I'm
using this also from weigh their rose
hair in body oil it smells so good and
it just makes my hair look super shiny
and hydrated
now my personal favorite part of the
morning is picking out my outfit I
typically go for you know where I'm
going that day what the sort of weather
is if I'm going to be taking pictures or
not and I'll just sort of a lay stuff
out on my bed hold stuff up in the
mirror you know just typical getting
what I should sort of wear out for the
day I decided to go with a pair of jeans
and this long furry trench coat that I
haven't worn yet I was so excited to
wear it because I love it I'm wearing a
silk like ruched bodysuit this is also
from my mum made it and these snakeskin
heels you guys have seen these from a
hall before they were surprisingly kind
of comfortable and then I just paired
that with some gold necklaces and little
rhinestone studs in my ears my jeans
were from Levi's and then my jacket is
actually from H&amp;amp;M even though I was
super dressed up I was actually very
comfortable and very warm because of the
fur coat because it was sort of chilly
that day
but yeah that was my fault morning
