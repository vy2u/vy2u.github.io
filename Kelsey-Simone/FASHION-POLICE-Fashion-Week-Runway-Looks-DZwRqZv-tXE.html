to do a little fashion police and we're
basically gonna look through pictures
from the runway of New York Fashion Week
and we're just we should talk about them
we may like them we may not I mean that
fascist fashion sometimes it gets a
little crazy I have my laptop so I can
look at the pictures here and then I'll
put them on the screen over here you as
well okay Louie Vuitton yeah they killed
this Kate Moss looking gorgeous and
fabulous and beautiful in this jacket
which I wore something similar to this
so Fashion Week I wore like my coat lik
tied mom like you wear it like a dress
and I like the fact that they just have
no pants underneath
I totally wore the coat like a dress
with the boots love the boots I think
that it's cool like the boot pattern
matches with the jacket and then matches
with the belt
ten out of ten that's what I'm gonna say
love this look top the next look what we
have is from G CBS which I do personally
like them as a designer I just can't
ride this wave all the way to the shore
if you know what I'm saying
give me an occasion where everywhere
this I don't understand the underwear I
think the purpose was being they wanted
the focus to be on the boots if I had
boots have been around for a little bit
that's definitely been a trend that's
like stuck you know um I'm trying to
find something nice to say
I can't it's highly sit underwear with
green swans on it I thought they were
snakes yeah G CDs did they make some
really cute clothes with this look this
is the new Versace spring 2018
collection I mean does that not scream
me I mean it's my color tones black it
looks amazing you've got this cool like
denim shirt under a denim jacket if
that's not cool I don't know what is
we've got the pants I love even the
overalls like I don't like overalls
take a nightmare a little farm girl but
whoa this is making me very happy I'm
used to Versace being like really like
loud prints and I just really like this
I like the mini bag I like the belt like
I like everything about this actually
everything there's not one thing I don't
like about it going to brunch with the
gals you know let's get some gal pals
that's what I'd be wearing the next
thing that we have is from the Saline
show does that not scream fashion she
wears shoes when you have the kids art
classes sex ed I don't know what the
heck I said I don't know what look they
were going for I mean it looks like she
has a grocery bag in her hand cuz she's
wearing like a purse and like a clear
plastic grocery bag I like we can see
everybody else in the crowd is looking
at it with just as much confusion as I
am next show is also one of my favorites
this is the Oscar de la Renta shell
which somebody might be to a red carpet
because I wanted buy these dresses
they're all beautiful like in their own
way the one on the left
I love the embroidery on the top holy
moly holy guacamole the one in the
middle that cape dude okay if I was a
superhero when I Cape would look like
that it would have like embroidered
rhinestone roses on it and then the one
on the right I love the deep plunging
neckline how it like swoops and it's not
just like straight down um I love the
slit it's simplistic the shape of it is
just it looks so good like look at we're
all twins we're like quadruplets with
our hair look Wow I just love the
dresses especially the one on the left
I feel like that I would wear to
whatever next occasion I have coming up
next year that we have is the Tom Ford
show I saw all the looks at the time for
show love them all but for some reason
this specific one I don't like I could
so do
so you know mean my little Martha
Stewart crack - skills I could DIY that
dress I don't like the way they styled
it with the leggings though like the
dress is cute I left a little bow in the
front it's a velvet bow I love those
earrings love the earrings I'm doing it
the way they styled it I think the
flocks are really ugly
I don't like ballet flats and I don't
like the leggings either it's not my
favorite but it's not the worst either
so we'll meet right in the middle I
think we're giving this a 5 out of 10
the next designer that we have is
Alexander Wang which happened to be one
of my top top favorite shows of all of
the spring/summer New York Fashion Week
I love that Center and as a designer I
love the show that he put on it was
gorgeous and beautiful and I loved every
single outfit including these two that I
have here it's like PJs till like the
20th element like the coolest of cool
PJ's those leggings are just really cool
I really love the leggings I want them
really bad animal like fur top that's so
cool I've never seen anything like that
and I love like furry details I would so
happily rock these and I love the
turtleneck hoodie
thank you I'm Xander Wayne Bravo that's
all I have to say this looks beautiful
it looks stunning I loved your show just
it's a lot of color oh my god I just
noticed she's wearing two purses can I
listen I think that's pretty cool and I
like the rhinestone head thing I saw the
rhinestone head thing on Instagram
actually and I think that that's pretty
cool
I think the two purse thing that's rad
and I really like the head thing yeah
next look is from the Zimmerman show I
feel like right now currently in this
time period of my life this describes my
style um you've got the white sneakers
with the tan legs you've got a fanny
pack with like a flowy flouncy like
italian looking dress with a bunch of
jewelry and I feel like that's exactly
the look that I go for
I love the fanny pack fanny packs I've
been loving and I love
the fact that it's like a higher and
looking fanny pack and then I love the
combo of sneakers with a dress that's
like my favorite thing ever I love the
sleeves of the dress I love the thought
of it like those little you've never
seen me in this blue color but I
honestly think I would look like pretty
in that color and dress like I wear that
too like maybe dinner by the water I
like to think of where I'd wear outfits
to the tan on her chest doesn't match
her legs at all but I can't judge a girl
for that because your girl doesn't
herself yes love it so that is it for
the looks we're gonna be going through
