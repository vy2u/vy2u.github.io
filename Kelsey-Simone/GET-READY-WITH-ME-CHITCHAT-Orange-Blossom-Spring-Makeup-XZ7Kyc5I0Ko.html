channel as you can tell were zoomed in
slightly closer to my face than normal
because we are doing a makeup tutorial
well not technically a makeup tutorial
we're gonna be doing like a little
chitchat get ready with me I have all
like brand new products either stuff
that sent to me it's just come out fresh
off the market I even think I have stuff
that might not even be out yet I think
we're gonna do like a creamsicle II like
a nice orange blossom I yeah I have
everything here we're just gonna see
what happens as we go along I'm gonna be
using the lemare the moisturizing a cool
gel cream this is a new I don't think
this is like a brand new product like to
the market but it is definitely a new
product to my face recently went to a
LeMay or like launch party it was so fun
actually I've logged it if you want to
go check out my Malibu vlog I really
like the gel one they come in like all
different consistencies and I really
like the gel one before I do my makeup
because I feel like it works well with
my foundation also real quick got him
oyster eyes for my lips this is the
lemare just the lip balm very original
name the only product that I don't have
brand new is my primer so I'm just gonna
use my hangover coconut primer from Too
Faced did you see the windows open in
the background and you can't even see
it's snowing currently we're in the
middle of a snowstorm and I'm over here
doing a creamsicle spring look this
morning I woke up and I was in such a
good happy mood I wanted to go drive and
get an acai bowl for breakfast before I
filmed and that tree was ruined by the
snowstorm next wear foundation we have a
new foundation this is the Marc Jacobs
shameless foundation youthful look
24-hour foundation it has SPF in it and
this is in the shade medium looks like
might be a little dark I have fake
Tanner on so that's why there's like a
difference um we'll see
well feat we'll see we'll figure it out
I think it'll be fine I never know what
to talk about during these like get
ready with me chitchat Pub do your
fortnight guys color not bad that's good
right I think it looks good I think it
looks fine let me just oh I always like
to check what it looks like like in the
natural daylight a concealer we have
this this is the larmor see a flawless
fusion longwear concealer this concealer
they did just send to me but I've
already used it a couple times and I
love this one okay perfect there we go
and then I'm gonna powder it I'm
generally used my Laura Mercier powder I
don't really venture into the world of
the different powders very much once I
find one I like I don't change my ladies
I'm just gonna set that under there I'm
gonna take my concealer and go under
where I contoured just so that it helps
me like keep it cleaned up and then I'm
just gonna use my NARS Laguna bronzer I
don't honestly really have any new
bronzers so this one is just one I
haven't used in forever so yeah but oh
the brush that I'm using I never say the
brushes that I'm using I'm so sorry you
got his this is from the Smashbox brush
set it's their buildable cheek brush
what was I talking about honestly my
brain moves so fast I didn't even know
speaking of June actually we weren't
even talking about June but let's just
pretend we were speaking of June my
birthday is in June and for my birthday
this year I'm planning on going to Italy
I think I already talked about that
before or like on social media or
something but for my birthday were going
to Italy and I'm very very excited I'm
already thinking about what outfits
and it's many months away okay we're
looking chiseled very nice very good
next NARS sent me these new highlighters
one I'm gonna use as a blush and then
the other one I'm gonna highlight with
where's that smell coming from
oh my candle okay I was like dang this
blush smells good
okay we're gonna nothing's happening
blush is a new thing to my makeup
routine I never wore blush my entire
life but I'm starting to like it now I
like the we're getting back to our rosy
cheeks and freckles roots blush is
looking good and then highlighting oh
hey this is drugstore honey this is it
okay this is the only drugstore product
I have them so sorry um this is from
covergirl this is one of their newer
actually I don't even know is this out
yet I don't know this is the covergirl
look lock up look look up look like oh
that's so weird to say all day setting
this you have this Laura Mercier fan
brush I'm gonna spray it on the brush
Wow Wow
that wasn't exaggerated it actually kind
of was but like that was not exaggerated
this smells so good
oh my god um that smells insanely good
okay so we're just spray it on here also
spray it on your face if you want to
have a little fun and then we're gonna
dip this I haven't used these yet so I
get like a nice little gleam nice little
gleam I like it though very natural very
pretty I lent the natural gleaming
highlighters more than like the super
glitter bomb ones just because I feel
like they look more natural more just
like luminescent skin rather than you
have glitter on your face you know um so
I do I really like this oh yes that chin
pop it look at that glow on my chin my
chin glows never looked so good
I really like this highlighter look at
the Cupid's bow oh yes look at that
Cupid's bow I also like to bring my
highlighter under my eyes I know that's
like not a thing anybody does but I do
it now we can spray some more also
really quickly alarmers he sent me this
I haven't used it so this is their
mineral illuminating powder in the shade
candle light so it's like a powdered
highlighter but I'm assuming because
it's in such a big jar it could be used
like on the body I'm gonna dip this in
there and we're gonna get some like
collarbone ashes oh dude that's nice
whew
I'm gleaming what guys do you see this
right now this looks so good next what's
next I'm a beauty guru I should know
what step comes next
eyebrows okay for my eyebrows I recently
picked up this product when I was in
Malibu this is the Dior show bold brow
brow mascara Oh
so another random thing I thought of a
couple videos ago when I was doing
vlogmas and one of my blog mice's i had
talked about how i was gonna change my
hair I'm still considering and changing
my hair like heavily like I really want
to do it cuz I'm thinkin worst case
scenario if it doesn't look good it
takes me 30 minutes to dye my hair back
black like it's gonna be so easy or not
black I diet dark brown so worst case
scenario like if I don't like it I can
just die back dark CI honestly I kind of
like that just like the natural just
like brow gel look I don't think I want
to fill them in or anything the eye part
this is where it all gets fun I have a
couple new things some this I don't even
know if this is out yet honest taja just
sent me literally yesterday their new
soft glam palette it's like velvet which
i think is so cool so they do it's meant
for me it literally has a color called
orange soda
didn't I say didn't I say I was gonna do
an orange cream look right there
orange soda BAM also Too Faced just sent
me like three days ago they're white
peach palette which does it's peach so
it has a lot of orange e peachy tones up
here so I might just go back and forth
I'm gonna take the soft glam and I'm
gonna use this shade burnt orange as
like a transition color I'm going to use
this crease brush this is from Laura
Mercier is well this is their finishing
tail it so literally called a ponytail
brought you in a little bit we're just
putting there it is Bert orange right in
my crease just I was like a little
orange e transition shade I'm going to
smudge this creme de la
peach from the peach palette and I'm
going to smudge this underneath my
bottom lash line and then a little bit
in the outer corner just like that now
I'm gonna go back with my pony tail
brush and I'm gonna take I'm gonna take
this dark brown and I'm just gonna put a
little bit of that in the outer corner
just to darken up the look a little bit
so my camera randomly just decided to be
full which is so rude um but I just did
two steps on this I bet you didn't see
it was just two steps so I'll just shake
it took the Tom Ford gold glitter put it
on the inner corner of my eye and then
slightly blended it up like it was
fading into my lid if you can see that
there I accidentally took some of the
creme Dilip peach on my ring finger and
then I like touched it to the middle
right here and then just magically
created a gradient seriously this is how
I do my makeup I just like accidentally
things will happen then it'll be like oh
hey that looks good so yeah I'm just
basically gonna clean it up and then do
the same thing on the other eye so there
we go just sharpen that up really simple
and then I'll do it over here next for
mascara I'm gonna use this is the Tom
Ford what is this called the extreme
mascara I just picked this up I don't
think this is a new product but I've
never tried any of their mascaras before
I heard a lot of good stuff about this
and I
love it I'm not gonna put too much of it
though because I'm gonna use some lashes
dang it there we go we're looking alive
now for my lashes I'm gonna put on just
like some natural these are like the
little wispies from our dough okay we're
back here's the eye look now all we got
to do is the lip and for the lip I have
this pre-planned this lip is from Laura
Mercier this is the extreme this is also
like a newer lip line so this is like a
little lip cran if you will I'm gonna I
like these because it's kind of like a
liner and then the lipstick in the same
as I was saying it is a very vibrant
orange e toned red ooh okay I just had a
good idea I'm gonna take some of this of
the Tom Ford gold glitter and I'm gonna
highlight my Cupid's bow of it boom yes
yes whoa that looks so good I'm very
pleased with this look I think it came
out good we are gleaming and glowing
brighter than the snow covering my house
okay we've got not as much of a
creamsicle look on the eyes I expected I
think the dark brown that I used to
darken it up definitely blend it out
some of the bolder oranges and I didn't
really have like a neon orange color
um but you still see this you still see
the subtlety like the subtle hint of
peaches in there which is nice I like
that so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it
