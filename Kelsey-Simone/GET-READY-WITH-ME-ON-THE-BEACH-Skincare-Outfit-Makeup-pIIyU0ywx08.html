to do a sort of Travel Beach get ready
with me and before I actually get into
the getting ready process or filling
myself with any food I like to fill
myself with the board I like to do
morning devotions you guys know this
because I talk about it a lot I will
bring my little Jesus Journal which I
love for traveling because when I get
inspiration I can write stuff down and
when I'm at the beach I tend to get a
lot of inspiration I'll put on some
worship music and just sort of pray and
everybody has their morning ritual you
know some people do yoga some people do
their morning workout this is just what
I like to do to start off my day this
morning I was going out to breakfast
with my family so I just had some iced
coffee before I went out just to you
know wake me up and right after that
I'll get straight into my skincare if
you've seen my videos you know how
important and essential my skincare is
and when I'm traveling I like to travel
light
yes I literally bring one skincare
product these are the Olay daily facial
I want to say a quick thank you to LA
for sponsoring this video as well as
blessing me with this product these
wipes do a ton of things all in one it's
a beauty multitasker basically it will
remove your makeup it also cleanses your
skin it has toner in it it will mask
your skin with hydrating conditioners
and it will also exfoliate oh yeah all
of that in one so their dry cloths which
is really great because then you don't
ever have to worry about them drying out
on you while traveling you basically
just sort of massage it like this under
the running water it creates tons of fun
little bubbles I like to squeeze out all
the excess water and then I rub it on my
skin you really feel it getting clean
the texture of the cloths you can really
feel it exfoliating as well which is
great because traveling makes your skin
really dry and these are super duper
hydrating it's like bringing an entire
facial with you in a small box such as
my favorite part about this product now
only did these wipes work miracles on my
skin but they're also very affordable
they're only 749 you can get them at
either any drugstore or you can get them
at Olay calm you guys can see the glow
that I have here from using them I don't
even have makeup on yet but before I get
to that I'm gonna change into my outfit
and then I'll go into my little makeup
routine I don't really wear too much
makeup when I'm on vacation because
obviously I'm getting in and out the
water and stuff so I use a tinted
moisturizer just
match my fake tan to my face because you
don't wanna be that girl and then I'll
put some brow gel on I'll do like a
little bit of bronzer if I'm really
feeling fancy maybe a little bit of
liquid highlight I honestly don't even
really need it too much but you know
it's it's the beach I go a little crazy
on the Glo and a little bit of gloss to
keep them moisturized and that girlies
is the finished look it's very natural
and simple I feel like if you have a
really great skincare routine and you're
glowing and radiant from underneath you
don't need too much makeup that's just
basically been my beauty routine lately
is so much more skincare than makeup but
with the Olay wipes I only need to do
one step so it cuts my time when I'm
traveling in half which is amazing
honestly even less than half and now to
finish the rest of my morning I'm gonna
walk down to the beach Oh get a little
twirling session in it that is essential
to my morning I'm gonna spray a little
sea salt spray in my hair when I'm at
the beach I just let my natural curls
flourish and do their thing and then of
course a sunblock SPF that's another
thing about I just lather in I think
that it is so important and I am ready
to go that is about it I like to keep it
simple like to keep it quick so thanks
to Olay for helping me do that that way
I can just enjoy my vacation and I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video give it
