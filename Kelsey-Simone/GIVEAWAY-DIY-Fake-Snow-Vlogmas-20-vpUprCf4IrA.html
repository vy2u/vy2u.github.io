right now I'm wearing a cologne
Christmas onesie a loving tan sent to me
I also sporting that loving tanum super
bronze I found this a little DIY on
Pinterest to do like to make fake snow
it recently has snowed outside but all
the snow is gone now and I saw this it's
like I really want to do that so for the
big snow it's pretty simple so you guys
can definitely follow along if you want
basically you're just going to need a
big bowl to have your snow in and you
only need baking soda and shaving cream
mix two and a half cups of baking soda
and a half cup of the shaving cream or
you can use conditioner they also say
that you can use conditioner and some
shaving cream if you don't have shaving
cream I got it right out easy it tastes
really bad so we need 1/2 a cup of the
I'm a little extra bird just cuz I mean
hey that actually does kind of look like
snow like the consistency can feel cold
oh my god it's like weird whoo that's so
cool that's awesome I don't know if you
could feel it oh that's why I hate it
it's nice it looks like real snow and I
can feel I know if you can see it it's a
focus there we go see okay that should
be good okay
what are you feeling right now Nepal
whoo there we go yes now we gotta don't
laugh at me what did you do but look I
made the snow okay I can try it it's
gonna taste bad so
it just is really salty it's the bacon
for this you're hoping we're gonna roast
marshmallows why is everybody in my life
a hater we're gonna roast and toast the
marshmallow we're gonna do it in the
oven this is something I actually do all
the time you can do it in the oven where
I already have graham crackers and I
have chocolate so we're gonna make
s'mores so basically for the s'mores I'm
gonna take a cookie sheet and I'm just
put aluminum foil on it and we're just
gonna make s'mores like graham cracker
chocolate marshmallow graham cracker and
just put them on there and we can put
them in the oven and then the heat will
just naturally melt it it does need to
stay in there for long at all probably
only like five minutes at the most until
you see the chocolate get melted and the
marshmallows get toasty gonna put two
there and then a marshmallow and then
another one on top and then another
graham cracker I have a little a special
announcement for you guys I thought I
would make it now it just makes sense so
I'm gonna be doing like a little
Christmas giveaway I'm doing three mini
Christmas giveaways and they're all
gonna be running through my Instagram so
make sure you're following me on
instagram cuz that's where I'm
announcing what's in the giveaway the
rules the winners it's all going through

the screen over here so that you guys
can follow me if you want to be part of
the giveaway but yeah I thought it would
be fun I really really wanted to do a
Christmas giveaway giveaway is for US
residents only yeah I think it'll be
really fun
um yeah my s'mores are done I'm gonna
put them in the oven um so yeah I'll be
right back once they're all warm and
toasty I'll come back we'll do like a
little taste test look at that they're
like nice and gold well Wow
Wow but I just say something sort of
tastes like a cheese bitch what happy
buildi died it does not at all taste
like cheese didn't good job so that is
