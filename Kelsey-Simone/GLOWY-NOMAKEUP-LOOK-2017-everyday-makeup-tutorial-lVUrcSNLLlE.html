showing you how to get this no makeup
look it has very dewy glowy skin and
it's supernatural
it's basically what I'm wearing every
single day right now all of the products
I'm using in this video are honestly
some of my favorites right now some of
my favorite products you can even try
out on the Sephora virtual artist app
which is really cool so thanks to
support for working with me on this
video all these makeup products are the
balm and can be bought at your local
Sephora make sure to use the hashtags
trending at Sephora and no makeup book
to show me your recreation to start this
natural no makeup look I'm going to be
starting off with a fresh base no makeup
I feel like the most important part is
the dewy glowy skin so I'm going to be
starting with this fresh youth preserve
lotion this is a face cream that I'm
obsessed with it's just going to make
your skin super duper hydrated
especially in the winter time right now
this is amazing for under your makeup
and it's just going to prep your skin
for your foundation for foundation I'm
going to be using my bare minerals
complexion rescue this is a tinted
hydrating gel cream which is super cool
this foundation is light enough that
it's not going to cover up my freckles
which is just what I want and that's
perfect for the natural look it's also
going to even out my skin tone if you
guys didn't notice I have a little bit
of a fake tan on my body so it's just
going to even that out I'm going to be
blending it with the super big fluffy
flat top brush I feel like that just
sort of gives it an airbrushed flawless
effect to the skin so apply this all
over your face but also don't forget
your neck and ears
now onto concealer we want something
super light not anything thicker cakey
because this is sort of a no makeup look
I'm obsessed with this Bobby Brown
concealer I'm going to be applying a
little bit under my eyes if you have any
problem areas apply it there too
and then again I'll be blending that in
with a super fluffy brush now onto the
eyebrows we're going to be keeping them
super natural in light I'm only going to
be filling them in a really little bit
I'm going to be using this Marc Jacobs
eyebrow pencil which I love because it's
not too harsh I want to be taking the
spoolie brush on the end of it and just
brushing all my brow hairs up and out
this sort of makes them look fuller and
I just really like the messy natural
look that it gives your eyebrows
once I'm done brushing them I'm going to
take the actual pencil end of it and I'm
only going to draw a line underneath my
eyebrows I'm not going to bring the
pencil anywhere towards the top work
inside of my eyebrow just a line
underneath to just sort of groom them
and shape them perfectly this is what I
do
every day this is my everyday eyebrow
look is this drawing this one little
line and then of course if you mess up
you can just blend it out with your
spoolie
sometimes I like to draw one or two
hairs right in the front just teeny tiny
to make them look a little bit thicker
next I'm taking my a massager clear brow
gel which is my go-to I seriously use
this every day I've used this product
for so long I'm going to be taking this
and just brushing all my browsers up
this is just going to keep them in place
all day long I look kind of crazy with
just my brows done but we're going to go
ahead and finish the face using
highlighter my fave I'm using this RMS
Beauty highlighter in the color living
Luminizer oh my god can I just tell you
how this is my new obsession I'm dipping
this brush in there and just putting it
on my face the reason this is good for
the no makeup look is because it has no
glitter in it it's not sparkly so it's
not going to just look like you threw
glitter on your cheeks it's really just
it makes your skin look dewy and glowy
like it's a really natural glow like
your skin is just beaming and there's no
glitter which I love so it just looks
super natural and I put this everywhere
I put it on my cheekbones the tip of my
nose I'll use my finger just for more
concentration I put it on my forehead on
my Cupid's bow and on my chin
now I'm going to be using the multi
stick from bite I'm going to be using
the colored cashew what this is is
basically a lip and cheek stain you can
use this universally honestly I'm going
to be using cashew as a blush I'm just
going to be dabbing this all over the
apples of my cheeks and I'm going to
blend it out with a damp Beauty Blender
just to sort of add some color to my
face and liven it up
Oh
now onto mascara I'm going to be using
the benefit roller lash this mascara I'm
obsessed with for just a nice natural
just light mascara look if you don't
want anything clumpy and super fake this
is great I'm just going to be adding one
coat of this onto my top and bottom
lashes
just to sort of flare them out make them
really flirty and just darken them and
lengthen them a little bit to complete
my eyes I'm going to go in with the same
highlighter I used on my face with this
small brush and just put that on the
inner corners to just sort of awaken and
open up my eyes lastly moving on to lips
I'm going to use another bite multi
stick this is in the color blondie this
is the perfect nude I love nude lips
these are super creamy which I love so
even though it is matte it's not going
to dry you out at all I'm just going to
be applying this obviously on my lips
and then a quick little trick I always
do expecially from wearing off the
shoulder tops is all takes on my
highlighter and I like to put it on the
collarbones and the tip of my shoulders
I thought I'd show you guys this because
I love doing this it just looks so
pretty now to finish off the look I'm
using my Urban Decay chill all nighter
setting spray setting sprays are so
important because they're going to lock
in your makeup and also give them a
little bit of do to the skin I spray way
too much of this on my face I swear but
that is the finished look super natural
almost like you're wearing no makeup
super glowy just fresh hydrated skin
which I'm obsessed with oil I love it
and I hope you guys loved it make sure
