a get unready with me nighttime routine
afternoon routine whatever you want to
call it not sure what I'm titling this
yet but so yeah I'm going to start off
in the bathroom and I'm saying goodbye
to the glam of the day that I did and
we're going to remove it all so yeah I'm
gonna get changed and I put on a robe
and I'm gonna put my hair up because who
likes doing their skin care with their
hair down because then you get it wet so
yeah and then also look how cute my robe
is and glow so I start with a makeup
removing wipe and I take off the easy
parts of my makeup basically like my
foundation my lip color my brows and I
wait to use a like actual makeup remover
wash for my eye makeup because it's a
little bit harder to get off and I know
don't comment about how my face is
whiter than my body I don't have big
tanner on my face anyways so yeah I just
use a oil-based lol look at my face is
the oil-based face wash just to get off
my makeup and I have a clean face now
yay so I really dry skin I have to
moisturize my face I do this like two
times a day and this is actually a
specific nighttime moisturizer so I put
like a lot on and this is also like
luminizing vitamin moisturizer I use for
my face and it comes with the dropper so
it makes me feel really cool and the
last part of my skincare routine is a
face mask and this is a sheet mask that
makes me look kind of like a masked
murderer but it's okay so I put that on
there and just stick it on my face so I
normally leave the face mask on for
about ten to fifteen minutes and while I
was doing that I decided to get on my
phone and I played a game this game app
is called a best fiends and every Juber
is talking about it so of course here
iam talking about it I'm on level 31 and
it's a puzzle game app you have all
these different characters that you can
collect as you can see I have all those
in the top little row because I'm
basically a pro you build the team with
them and then you defeat those little
slug thingies which every game every
level has a goal at the top left corner
you can see they were like eight slugs I
had to kill and then I have to like open
one of those bomb things
to do that you connect these little
icons there's flowers leaves water drops
and all these different ones you connect
them and as many as three or more to try
to make a combination to defeat the
slugs and sometimes it's actually pretty
hard the game is actually harder than I
thought it was going to be like the more
levels you get into but that's what
makes it really addicting and fun yeah I
literally just play this when I have any
free time when I'm not doing anything
I'm always playing this game checking
social media I'm on my phone 24/7 guys
the game is free in the App Store and I
will give you the link in the
description below but right once I was
done playing that I started to take a
bubble bath because what doesn't scream
a relaxing afternoon routine video like
a bubble bath with this lush gold bubble
bar I already use some of it but you can
use these as much as you want and I just
crumbled that into my bath kind of look
like pee water but that's what I get for
picking a gold bath bomb so yeah I do
have a bathing suit on just letting you
know so sitting in my bath I was
freaking out about the really minimal
Valentino add and then I took my thingy
off and then I just kind of rubbed the
rest of the serum into my face and I try
to make a cute little scene of me
blowing bubbles but then I got really
frustrated because it didn't work out
the way I wanted it to
so once I'm added back I put on PJs and
I start to clean my room I used to be a
very messy person but literally my new
year's resolution was to be more
organized and clean so I always make
sure to clean my room literally every
day I tidy up whatever is messy in my
room and try to keep it as clean as
possible then I'm gonna take my
electronics and head to my bed I get on
my laptop and I do bible scriptures and
devotions which I think I was doing
there cuz it looks like I was ruined in
the day right and I also take this time
to work on planning videos and stuff so
I like to snapchat my friends just
basically have a little Wi-Fi party I
was facetiming one of my friends here
and yeah that's about it for my night so
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
it subscribe down below to see more
videos I post new videos on my channel
every single Friday and yeah I love you
guys so much
they don't see me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
