Oh
so the first thing I normally do in my
process of like getting ready is
normally just obviously brushing my
teeth and going to the bathroom I like
to wash my face in the morning just to
get off any makeup I didn't last night
and I use these two face washes hey you
know wash my face with them
then I like to tone my face and I use
witch hazel and I use the lavender
scented one because just like natural
witch hazel smells really really bad and
also I moisturize my face because I have
really really dry skin so this helps my
makeup look better when I put it on now
I'm going to be doing my makeup I start
off with BB cream since it's summer it's
a lot layer of my skin and I just kind
of use a flat top brush and just blend
it all out then I do my eyebrows and I
use my Anastasia little brow pomade dip
thing you know and I fill my eyebrows I
have an old eyebrow tutorial on my
channel you can go check it out but it's
like not how I do my eyebrows now if you
want to updated one let me know and also
if you want like an everyday makeup
tutorial let me know because this isn't
really like that in depth or anything
after I fill my eyebrows I normally like
conceal them and then I also use my
gimme brow on top just to set them and
make them look nice then I use my Mac
contouring palette and I just I don't
know what the names of these are but I
mix these two together and I just kind
of blend them out and use it on my
temples and you know my jawline
and then I highlighted with my little
benefit sample next thing I do is use my
Kat Von D eyeshadow palette and I mix
these two colors together and just kind
of use a fluffy brush and blend them
inside of my crease
and then Wow
great job showing your eyeliner calcium
good job that you can see just perfectly
exactly what I'm doing but I just do my
winged liner I don't have a tutorial and
this again if you want to see a video
like tutorial I don't really make many
makeup tutorials but I could you know
and then I go in with my L'Oreal mascara
and this is my favorite mascara of
literally all time
um then I will take a little pencil
eyeshadow brush and just use this darker
color from the palette and kind of put
that on my bottom lash line for my lips
I use one of my Mac lip liners I'm not
sure what the name of the one I'm using
here is but I just kind of lined my lips
with that and it's just like a really
pretty nude color now I'm done my makeup
that's my full look not really everyday
but it was a little you know something I
did I kind of kept my hair the same I
just like redid my little messy bun
because I didn't feel like doing my hair
that day so to get dressed I normally
obviously I go inside of my closet to
get my clothes
I ended up wearing this outfit um I wore
my Mac necklace which is totally in
focus right now my top is this crop top
that's like purpley gray from forever 21
my shorts IDI wide myself they're
thrifted and the flannel is also
thrifted I'm just wearing my black
converse with my little gray and white
striped socks from forever 21 and then
you know my purse obviously is my little
keychain and yes I hope you guys enjoyed
getting ready with me and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
