to be doing a very requested video which
is my skincare routine to start it off
I'm just going to be taking makeup wipes
to remove my makeup these are from milk
and thier packaging is so aesthetically
pleasing I love their products but I'm
going to be removing all of the makeup
except for my eye area I like to use
something a little bit more gentle
because I have a really sensitive skin
for my eye area I'm going to be using
the Josie Maran Argan cleansing oil and
pretty sure that's how you say it I'm
going to be applying this just to my dry
skin this stuff low-key tastes good um
but Oh cute Kelsey and then I'm going to
rinse that off and then pat dry my face
now I'm going to get into heavy duty
cleaning now that all our makeups off
I'm going to put my hair up into a bun
so that it's out of my face and I'm
going to get out my vanity planet skin
brush this is my little spa skin set I
don't use every single day like every
other day but this is what the set looks
like it has the brush and then three
different heads for it it's
battery-operated so it's pretty easy and
like look look how it just look how cute
it is this is the first brush this the
silicone brush the exfoliating brush and
then the daily cleansing brush that I'm
going to start with that one because I'm
just going to clean my face I just put a
little cleanser on there you can use
whatever you have this is amazing I've
had other brushes before I used the
vanity planet one but this one's so good
for my skin because I have super
sensitive skin and the other ones always
get me really irritated and they make my
skin red and they just scratch me too
hard I guess so I really like this one
it's really gentle on my skin and just
cleans it without like you know digging
into my pores and stuff like that I will
link the brush down below for you guys
so that you can get one too and so that
you can display it just like I do so
that you can let everybody who comes
into your bathroom know that you're
really cool and use a skincare brush on
your face so once I'm done with that one
I'm going to move on to the silicon
brush and like a look look how easy that
was to change the heads it's really easy
so I'm going to wet the silicon brush I
don't really use any product on it I
just kind of rub it across my face in
the areas that my skin is really dry
do this instead of exfoliating my face
because most exfoliator that I use are
again like I have really sensitive skin
they're too rough for me so I just use
this and just take it across the areas
where they're really dry and take a sip
of water then I'm gonna use my glam glow
glam starting a luminizing moisturizer
this stuff is the bomb it's like liquid
highlighter but moisturizer it makes
your skin so glowy and dewy I also use
this before I put on my makeup because
it just makes my skin look so perfect I
love it so much
and it smells amazing then using my
highly talked about Mario Badescu a rose
facial spray I spray this a ton and then
take really deep breaths because it's
kind of relaxing and then I'm going to
use my glam glow this gravity mud mask
look at it it's literally metallic it
looks like slime I'm going to take a
foundation brush and apply this over my
face oh my gosh this stuff is amazing
I've talked about it on my snapchat to
you guys it goes on white and then dries
Chrome for me when it comes to face
masks I use different ones all the time
I don't have a specific like amount of
it I use them I just use them whenever I
have free time but I'll normally use
like a sheet mask a hydrating mask or
something like this that's a peel-off
that's just really fun and trying
something new this is my second time
using this one and I do really like it
so I just brush this all over my face
and I leave it on for about 20 to 30
minutes this one's not one that it's
going to irritate you if you leave it on
for a really long time so sipping some
more water and then waiting for that to
dry once it's dry I'm going to peel it
off which is my favorite part because
it's so satisfying oh my gosh it didn't
come off perfectly like I wanted to and
like one swipe I don't know how people
do that but I just peeled it off look at
that look at it just look at it come off
my forehead perfectly oh yes so once I'm
done with that spraying some more and
I'm going to use my loving tan bronze
shimmer luminous cream this step I only
use when I'm going out without makeup or
have people over and like I'm not
wearing makeup because as you can see
there's a big color difference between
my neck in my face I don't fake tan my
face so I'll use this stuff just kind of
like lotion and it's very good on my
skin it doesn't affect me at all and it
just gives me a little bronzed glow so
that my face will match my neck and I
don't look literally crazy
and then I'm going to do lip time this
is my lush mint julep almost half over
half the bottle is empty and it's mainly
from me eating it because it tastes so
good
I'm just going to scrub my lips with
this and right now I'm going to take the
time to disclaim I do not have lip
injections I get so many comments about
that on my mom's side we're Puerto Rican
that so that explains that and so I'm
going to be using my milk or Rose a lip
balm to finish it off just to moisturize
my lips this stuff smells amazing and it
looks cute and yeah this is just a
really good lip balm that I like to use
so now I'm done with my skincare oh wait
just kidding I have this herbivore
apricot hair spray that I just spray all
around my hair and body to make me smell
amazing now that I'm really done my
skincare you can enjoy your glowing
beautiful skin and your beautiful
natural phase if you liked this video
