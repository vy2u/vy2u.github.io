going to show you how to get this super
gold glowy look centered around this
very pretty nude lip and I'm in love
with it so all of the products used can
be found at Sephora but I'll also link
them below for you guys and if you want
to recreate this look make sure to use
the hashtag hashtag on nude lip and
trending at Sephora I'm really excited
to be working with Sephora on this new
lip trend because you guys know that
almost all I use is nude lip the UH nude
lip trend is all about finding the
perfect nude for you depending on your
skin tone whether it be matte creamy
metallic which I chose matte so to start
this tutorial I'm going to be priming my
face with the Too Faced hangover primer
I have gone through like three bottles
of this I love this stuff so much
it smells like coconuts and it's really
really hydrating so it's important for
me to put this on before I do my
foundation and now that we're all
hydrated I'm going to use the Becca
backlit priming filter this is just
going to give you like a little bit of
glow under your foundation it's also
going to make your skin look super dewy
which you guys know that's always the
look I'm going for for foundation I'm
going to be using my milk sunshine skin
tint you have heard me talk about this
many times this is still my favorite
foundation I love it i'm using the color
honey just so that it matches my fake
ten that I have on it's in a rollerball
so the application is super easy I just
put this all over my face and blend it
in with this super big flat top brush I
like this foundation because it does
give a pretty good coverage but it's not
too thick that it covers all my freckles
because I love showing my freckles it
also does not dry matte and take up at
all it's almost like a BB cream
for concealer I'm using my NARS radiant
creamy concealer this is in a little bit
of a lighter color just so that it
highlights underneath my eyes I'm just
going to blend this all in and I'm also
going to blend it on top of my eyelids
just to sort of prime them
using this NARS translucent powder I'm
just going to be setting where I put the
concealer on my eyelids and underneath
my eyes just so that it doesn't crease
under my eyes and that my mascara
doesn't transfer now to bronze up my
face I'm going to be using benefits do
the hula and I'm going to be applying
this with a little concealer brush it's
not super dark I'm not trying to do like
a harsh contour just sort of give my
face a bronzy glow so I'm going to put
this normally where you would bronze
your face and then I'm going to be
blending it out with a fluffy brush I
also like to clean it up with concealer
which as you saw that white line and
I'll just take my foundation brush and
just I'm not allowed to make it look
sharp but still soft and now for
highlighting I'm going to be using my
honest seljuq glow kit in subject and
I'm using the shade summer I would be
using my fan brush and just putting this
pretty much everywhere on my cheekbones
above my eyebrow the center of my
forehead down the bridge of my nose and
on the tip of my nose that's my favorite
part
and then also on my Cupid's bow and the
tip of my chin that stuff seriously my
favorite but now on to my eyebrows I'm
going to be using my March agusta-bell
pencil in my last tutorial you guys saw
how you did my brows it's pretty simple
I just brushed them out and then taking
the pencil side I just draw a line
underneath my brow just to define the
shape and then I will go back with the
spoolie brush and just sort of blend
that line up into my brow then I will
clean that up with some concealer just
underneath my brow and also go in with
the anastagia clear brow gel and push
all my brow hairs up just to sort of
make them look a little bit more natural
and messy now that I look crazy with
just eyebrows done I'm going to be doing
my eye makeup I'm using this custom
buxom palette I'm starting with this
just matte brown shade and putting that
in my crease and also focusing that on
the outer half of my bottom eyelid what
I also like to do is take the brush and
sort of take the eye shadow up towards
the end tip of my eyebrow as you can see
right there and just blend that into my
crease just to sort of give it that
triangular sharp shape then I'm going to
be taking this glittery gold color and
packing that on the inner half of my
eyelid sort of blending that into the
brown you can go back with the other
brush and just make it all seamless then
taking this save which is the si edit
fluid metal eyeshadow in the shade that
this is a liquid eyeshadow that will dry
powder like a regular eyeshadow and it's
super glittery it's so so pretty I'm
going to be putting this on the first
like own 1/4 of my eyelid and blending
that into the gold basically it'll look
like an ombre from this light shimmery
color to the gold to the brown next on a
pencil brush I'm going to be mixing the
brown that we used earlier and black and
just sweeping that underneath my bottom
lash line just to sort of darken up the
look and make it a little bit more smoky
and then going into mascara look how big
this wand is this is the size cream
mascara from Too Faced and I this is a
recent fav look at that that's one coat
what I'm going to be doing two coats on
my top and my bottom lashes
now for the liner I'm using the benefit
they're real liner and this is in the
color brown I think brown is really
pretty because it still adds that sort
of intense look of a winged liner
without being as intense as black what I
like to do is take my concealer brush
and just sort of flick the tip of the
eyeliner out like that so it looks super
sharp I feel like you can't really get
that look with just the eyeliner itself
I also know that you're supposed to do
liner before the eyelashes but I feel
like doing my mascara first sort of
gives me like a guide on where to do my
liner now onto the lips which are the
star of the look and they're going to
pull everything together I'm using this
white lip liner in the shade 12 just to
line my lips for the actual color I'm
using the Kat Von D liquid lipstick in
the shade LED wig look at this look at
this nude it's so pretty it goes on like
a lip gloss that dries matte and I'm
obsessed with it it stayed on all day
for me I honestly had so much trouble
picking which lip color to use for this
because before I gave me so many amazing
colors that it took so long to try to
pick my favourite but I really think
that this one looks great with the look
and you normally see me with the sort of
soft nude lips so that's what I decided
to go with and for my other favorite
options to achieve the metallic in cream
look would be the touch insole metalist
liquid foil lipstick duo can I tell you
how in love with this I am this glittery
side is my everything it is so pretty
look at that look how it glitters and
shines I am obsessed with this this is
like an in my purse everyday and then
the other side is this darker metallic
just really intense oily look I love
this too so much I can't wait to wear
that I just need an event to wear that
too and then I have the Sephora lip
gloss for more of like a cream look more
than everyday nude super peachy and
super pretty enemies really random but
they smell really good too and if you
wanted to go for a little bit of a dark
color for my metallic I have the
Smashbox be legendary at liquid lipstick
and the color brains and bronze and for
my matte I have the bight multi stick in
the color cocoa I'm obsessed with this
one if you want to try on any of these
colors for yourself you can use the lip
on tool in the Sephora app which will be
in the description I know that's cool
try it before you buy it but I really
hope that you guys
enjoyed this tutorial if you did give it

love you so much
