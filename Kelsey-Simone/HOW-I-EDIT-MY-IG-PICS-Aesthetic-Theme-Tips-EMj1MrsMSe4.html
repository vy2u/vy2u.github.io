intro so for today's video I decided to
do something that I get so so many
questions about whether it's comments on
Instagram pictures comments in YouTube
videos even in person people will ask me
always questions about how I keep up
with my Instagram theme how I edit my
pictures how you can get an Instagram
theme so I thought I'd just answer all
those questions just get out of the way
and film a whole video about it also I'm
in a spinny chair right now which I very
much enjoy sorry if I'm spending like a
lot throughout this video so first I'm
gonna start off with showing you guys
like how I edit my pictures right now
like the things I do the apps that I use
and then we're gonna talk about you know
all the tips on like how you guys can
get a theme what I do to keep my theme
you know where my inspiration comes from
I have a very strict aesthetic the
aesthetic from my Instagram sort of
carries throughout my YouTube videos and
it sort of carries out into my life as
you can see so the app vscocam vsco cam
whatever you want to call it I know that
this is an app that's so popular almost
everybody uses this app but I honestly
really love this app so on your homepage
you can like see all of your Instagram
pictures together which is really nice
you can see if all the colors are
matching that it sort of looks good with
your whole theme so to start off with
showing you how to edit my pictures I
have an unedited picture here it's just
a selfie of mine so recently I had
posted a little collage of some outfit
pictures and this selfie was from the
same day so I'm going to show you how
I'm gonna edit this picture to match all
my other pictures and just sort of how I
made it look the filter that I use right
now is m5 if you double click on the
filter it gives you the option to turn
down or up how much of the filters on
your picture I normally don't keep it
lit all the way up I'll turn it like
down to like either half or a little bit
more than half it's pretty much the same
process with all my pictures I kind of
do the same thing to every single
picture the only thing that's different
really is the brightness and contrast
the first one that looks like a little
Sun is your exposure which is how bright
the picture is going to be depending on
the actual picture that was taken I
honestly think I'm gonna keep it exactly
the same for this picture because I just
like the way that it looks and then the
contrast I normally pick up a little bit
I normally just sort of eyeball it I
don't really do like specifics or
anything just like whatever
honestly just looks good to me I've been
adding grain to a lot of my pictures
which sort of makes your picture look
like it was taken on like a vintage
camera it just adds this really cool
effect but I normally only do that two
pictures that I feel like it would look
good like that sometimes I'll add it to
selfies but sometimes I won't sometimes
I want them to be more like crisp and
clear if I do want them to be more crisp
then I'll turn up the sharpness which is
the little triangle but if I want to add
grain and then you can scroll down to
this little circle with the dots and you
can add grain to it so as you can see it
already looks a lot better with my theme
but we're not done yet so I'm gonna save
that picture and open it in another app
so I'm gonna open up the picture that I
just edited in facetune and as you can
see the wall that I shot on was a white
wall but because of the m5 filter it
made it look yellow so I'm gonna take
the whitening tool and then just sort of
like the next thing I'll do is I'll go
into details and I'll normally just put
this over like my eyes or like any
jewelry I may have on anything that you
really want to sharpen and make that
more in focus that's sort of where I put
the details but look at that it looks
great it goes with my theme it looks
beautiful
I love it now the third app that I use I
don't use it on all of my pictures it's
only like a rare occasion if I have a
specific picture that I need it for say
you take a really rad picture say you're
on the streets of New York and this
really good outfit everything looks
great but there's a blue car parked
behind you oh no you can't have blue in
the picture so I found this app that's
are really great for editing out only a
little bit of color so there is this app
I'm talking about now and you know what
it's called it's called color effects so
basically what it does is it will only
there black and white your whole entire
picture and then you can erase it where
you want color or vice versa you can
just have your regular picture and then
choose where you want the black and
white filter to be which I thought is
the coolest thing ever
so I have this photo that I actually
edited to go with my instagrams a super
nice little outfit picture from my New
York City look look now I do like the
greenery in the background because like
I said I do have some earthy tones in
there so the green is fine it's just the
red brick on the floor I'm not really
feeling that you know so I'm on the
color one which is the first one so I'm
basic
going to paint everything that's not the
red brick floor so that way the red
brick 4 will stay in black and white
it'll be like that dark gray color but
everything will go back to its original
color see that actually looks really
good with my theme I don't know I didn't
post that but now it looks good we have
the whole picture with all the colors
that I wanted but the red brick floor we
turn to black and white which I think
that's a great idea to be able to turn
specific parts of your picture black and
white so now I'm going to talk about how
you can get your own theme tips to get
your own theme so the first thing that
starts is having an inspiration knowing
obviously of what sort of color scheme
you're going for I definitely as you can
tell like almost everything in my life
people always comment that leads your
whole life seeing this aesthetic
obviously not my entire life is
aesthetic their thing is a mess - all
right um but for the most part I mean
I'm really into like interior design so
I love decorating my room and the color
scheme that I typically go for is just
always this I mean it's what I like it
so makes me happy I mean obviously if
you're into like more neon colors or if
you're into like pastels or dark tones
go with whatever you like it's just
these are just sort of the tones that I
personally like I have a weak hard at
page that's that's what I get all of my
inspiration from it is the best thing
ever I'll link mine down below just in
case you happen to have a similar sort
of study gives me I love maybe harder
it's basically my goals for what I want
my Instagram to look like I really like
what it looks like now though obviously
you can't copy people you're going to
have sort of your own flavor to
everything be very strict to your color
scheme I mean you could obviously your
aesthetic could be a colorful theme
where literally you can have any color
you want in it but I mean mine at least
is I would say if you're trying to go
for a very put-together look pick about
a good four colors four to five colors
and stick with those colors you know I
feel like that's what really pulls
everything together it makes it look
like a matching theme obviously colors
very important but the layout of
pictures of what's in the pictures is
also very important it helps so much
when I learned layout so I sort of
categorize pictures into like what they
are so for things that I post you have
selfies you have outfit pictures you
have item or like thing pictures and
then fillers which my fillers are
pictures of either like almost
nothingness like those white pictures
I'll post with like cute little like
scriptures or quotes or like a picture
of
of view like a beach so normally I'll
use those pictures when my theme is
looking a little bit cluttered like when
there's too much going on in the
pictures even if all the colors match
all the it's the same filter it's all
edited the same sometimes within the
pictures it won't go together so I'll
sort of space it out like I'll do a
selfie here a alpha picture here a
random thing in outfit picture and then
keep that going and then maybe like
sprinkle some fillers in between keep
things sort of separated like I wouldn't
post like selfie outfit outfit selfie
like cuz then it's too much of just me
like right there hey just to the I
doesn't look very pleasing I normally
don't like to post two pictures of
myself in a row unless they're
completely different so yeah I hope that
that was helpful to you guys because you
guys always ask me questions so I hope
that I was able to like answer all your
aesthetically questions aesthetically
