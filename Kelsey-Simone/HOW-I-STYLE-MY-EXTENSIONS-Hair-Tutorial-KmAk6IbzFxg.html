using my Titan three new meat hair
curler I was really excited when they
sent me this product and I started
playing around instantly and just trying
to bunch of different hairstyles that
would be easy enough to show you guys a
tutorial on I mean if it's easy enough
for you to do probably easy enough for
you to do I've been loving it it comes
with three different girls as you can
see and they all kind of give different
effects to your hair these are the three
on Farrell's that they have there is a
large one a medium one and a small one
I'm only using the small and the medium
ones for this tutorial and like pro tip
Fria the smaller the barrel is the
tighter your curl is going to be the big
curler
you could definitely use say if you have
short thinner hair or if you want to
just more like a loose sort of wave not
so much like a tight beachy curl which
is what I'm going to be doing so that's
why I'm not using this one this is so
funny because I I never know what I'm
talking about most the time and actually
it feels good I actually kind of know
what I'm saying right now I'm going to
be curling all of my hair using the
medium wand and then I'm going to be
going in with the small one and doing
just sort of like in detailed pieces for
like a little extra volume and then also
getting all the short pieces that don't
really have much of a curl to that I'll
be doing them on the small curler then
the navy color also comes with a heating
glove which is amazing I just say this
please please wear this the last time I
was combing my hair look at this look at
two birds right there if they hurt so
bad please use this I'm kind of stupid
so I need this because I will totally
burn a finger off if I don't use it this
curler is literally enniaa proof which
is good for me it only has three buttons
on it so there's an on and off button
and damper temperature so you kinda
can't screw that up there but this
curler actually gives me pretty good
volume like I don't normally have to do
that tons of teasing at the top with my
curls actually come out pretty
voluminous with this so it seemed up
right now and it literally takes less
than a minute to heat up it's already
hot why did I do that
um but yeah I'm just going to start in
the front going all the way to the back
at the ends of the curl I like to keep
it a little bit straight at the end so I
don't curl it all the way down to the
tip of my hair I normally leave it
pretty straight I feel like it looks a
lot more natural when you do have look
how pretty and I'm just going to take
this little piece and as you can see I'm
curling away from my face so it has that
sort of like windblown look and there we
go my first section is done okay so I'm
going to keep doing this all around my
head and I sort of alternate with
directions sometimes I will go towards
my face sometimes I'll go away from my
face just to sort of make the curls all
look different but for the most part
most of them go away from my face you
can see in my hair there are some like
short little certain pieces that would
won't curl but I kind of don't worry
about that now um I wait at the end take
the small barrel and do all those
Oh
Oh

my links down there too ok so now that
I'm done curling like the main big
pieces I'm going to turn this off and
I'm going to switch this out for the
small barrel and go in and get the rest
of my short hairs that are still showing
and also get some like detailed pieces
ok so now I'm just going in with like
little sections and like doing detailed
pieces like I already said before Oh in
like little disclaimer I did put um he
projected in before I did this I just
didn't get it on film
I know realtor my hair the back because
I feel like it's the most comfortable
and also like you can see all the curls
laid out a lot prettier than having it
like right in the way up in the front
look how pretty
now I'm going to take some sea salt
spray this part optional but I just like
to go in and kiss scrunch all of the
bottom of it so yeah kind of feeling
this right now and I hope that you were
able to learn from it and that was just
really helpful to you please
