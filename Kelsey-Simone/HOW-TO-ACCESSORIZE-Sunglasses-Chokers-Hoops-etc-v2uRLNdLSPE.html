this look book with this very beach
vibes look that I'm in love with my
sunglasses are from gif I wear these are
the Rose style glasses they have
tortoiseshell frames which you know I
love the tortoise look and they have
gray polarized lenses they also have
this really pretty gold bar across the
top of the glasses which I love and they
are in this cat eye sort of shape which
I think looks really good on my face I
love wearing these throughout the summer
they keep your eyes protected while also
keeping you looking very stylish this
eyewear has some really cute style
sunglasses you'll see that throughout
this lookbook and they're also really
really high quality glasses especially
for the price they're super affordable
they range between 75 to 85 dollars
which is really good for gorgeous
sunglasses that look designer so the
links to get the ones that I'm wearing
throughout the lookbook will be in the
description as well as a little 25% off
code for you guys because I love you the
next look that I have is like a dress-up
but to rest down look at the same time I
have these gorgeous frames which are the
crew shaped frames they have this matte
gold frame and Brown gradient lenses
which look amazing wearing a little
baseball cap and hoops with my dress and
I have some anklets on which I love
anklets for the summer these gold
gradient lenses that I'm wearing are
also from defy wear all the ones that
I'm wearing tout the lookbook are the
main thing that I love about div I mean
besides them having hot glasses is that
they also give a pair to charity for
someone who needs reading glasses in
either the US or Africa for every single
pair that they sell so if you want to
help out with that charity you can check
all the links of the bio
not only get yourself some super cute
glasses but also help somebody out who
really need some reading glasses which i
think is amazing accessorizing your
outfits is something that is so
important in fashion and sunglasses are
a very big part of that I love wearing
hoops would you see me wear in this
outfit and also in the next one I have
these super big wavy gold hoops as well
as another pair of Cruz glasses from dif
these ones have a gold frame with grey
lenses these glasses are
classic and they look amazing with
pretty much anything that you wear also
styled with that I have three layers
gold necklaces you guys know that it's
like my go-to accessory it looks great
with either a deep neck top or a very
plain top if your outfits looking a
little bit boring just add some cute
necklaces and add some cute sunglasses
and your outfit is instantly leveled up
I feel like this is a very classic me
look I love gold jewelry anything gold I
have a long necklace a medium sort of
length necklace and a choker chokers are
also another go-to especially this
summer even last summer they were cool
and I feel like next summer they'll be
cool as well I always love styling them
with my outfits hoops have been a new
thing for me that I've been obsessed
with lately for the next look I went a
little crazy guys and I added some color
these are the Bella frames from DIF they
also have a tortoiseshell frame but
these ones have gold mirrored polarized
lenses so they have this yellow hue but
what's really cool about them is on the
inside they make everything look purple
which I know that's really random but I
love them they look amazing and I love
this sort of squared off boxy shape I
think they look so sick I have paired
with that again my gold rhinestone
earring that you guys loved I've won
this before in a video it's just one and
then I have a simple rhinestone on the
other ear which i think is a really cool
look I have a simple just one letter
choker I feel like customized necklaces
are everything this summer to either
have your name or I normally just have
my first initial also with this look I'm
wearing a bunch of gold rings I feel
like rings or something that I never
used to wear but wear all the time now
and I also have this gold belt which is
the coolest thing ever
and for the last look of my lookbook I
have some rose gold glasses this ones
are in the style Becky and they have
these really pretty pink mirrored lenses
which I never thought I would say pretty
pink lenses but they look amazing
especially styled with this sort of
brown striped shirt I thought they
looked at like a really pretty duo with
this I have a body chain which is an
amazing accessory for the summer to wear
either with your outfit or with your
bathing suit they look great and then I
have these really just sort of detailed
earrings they're like these two little
circles it's sort of a mix when you want
to wear something
than a stud but not necessarily a hoop
or statement earring I also have my sort
of everyday ring styled with that it's a
very just simple look but I feel like
the glasses really pop with this look
I'm in love with it and I hope you guys
are too I hope you guys like these looks
as much as I did and I also hope you got
some maybe fashion or accessory
inspiration for the summer because
accessories are amazing in the fashion
world and so are sunglasses all of the

I'm wearing will be in the description
