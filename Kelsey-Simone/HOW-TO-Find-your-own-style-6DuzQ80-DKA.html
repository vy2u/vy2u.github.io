intro hello everybody so today I am here
filming this video for you I'm going to
be talking about one of my favorite
subjects fashion and style so basically
I was looking through like some comments
on my Instagram and some people asked me
just like random questions like Oh like
how would you describe your style what
type of style do you have I love your
style how do I find my own style and I
definitely feel like this was a struggle
for me and it's a struggle for pretty
much any teenage girl in fashion there
was definitely my situation and then
there was another situation that I
thought out and came up with where my
situation was I like tons of different
styles and I didn't really know which
one I belong to where I needed to like
stick with one style and I was like I
like all these things like what's my
style don't have a bunch of cells that
you like you legit just like need one to
like and you don't know what one you do
like
so this basically we're going to start
with my side where I liked a lot of
different styles and what that's called
is actually called being eclectic where
you like different styles you feel like
you need to belong to one I don't know
why but people these days we feel like
we need to belong to a certain category
your preppy or your grungy or your girly
or your whatever I honestly don't think
that you need to do that there are so
many like styles when you're eclectic
the best thing to do what I do is I mix
what I like and I take different aspects
of different styles that I like and mix
them into like this whole concoction of
an outfit does that make sense probably
not so I will like I have a grungy side
of me where I really like you know
ripped mom jeans and like high-top
converse and like band t-shirts and then
I have another side of me that's really
classy and a good lace-up heels and like
nude body con dresses and so I like sure
like you mix them together and make my
own outfit and that's my own style you
know like a year ago I would like redo
my room and not just redo it like one
week it would be like all pink do you
guys remember that if you go back in my
videos
it was SuperDuper pink and everything
was pink in my room because I love that
like whole girly I have a super girly
side of me and then the next week I
would like take all the pink out and
then I would like make it all amount of
chromatic just like black and white with
like succulents on the walls in like
1975 posters like I didn't really know
what I wanted to be and I liked multiple
different styles but I didn't know like
I felt like I had to stick to one and
now my room is still pretty
monochromatic but I also have hints of
girly things here and there like I have
some like rose gold jewelry cases and I
have some flowers in the corner and I
display my heels but then I also display
on my sneakers over there so I found a
good way to mesh it together and that's
honestly the easiest and best way to be
yourself is not just like feeling like
you need to conform to one specific
thing but I changed up all the time so
if you find yourself you have tons of
different styles you don't know what one
you belong to you don't belong to one
you need to learn to just be yourself
and mix what you like together maybe you
don't even have to mix it one day you
can be totally one style one day you
could be totally another and that's fine
that's you that's not weird that's just
you expressing the different things that
you like and that's totally okay on the
other hand of things where if you don't
really you don't really know what you
like um but you feel like you need a
specific style okay I hate when people
tell me this but when they're like oh
follow your heart like I don't know how
to do that have you ever been enough
forever21
if so do you know how like the stores
categorized into like different section
of the stores are like different styles
you could say like do you know what I'm
saying how like there's like a business
II classy side or then there's like a
super bohemian side and there's like a
really girly side like there's tons of
different styles which one like catches
your eye which are you most attracted to
um you can either go walking on your
hallway in school walking down the
hallway in a mall
what girl do you look at and you're just
like oh my gosh she looks really good
what is she wearing
what type of style does she have because
you're obviously attracted to that style
you obviously like that outfit and you
think it looks good that's probably the
style that you like definitely
like follow what your eye catches like
what colors do gravitate towards more
and like what kind of vibes of outfits
do like more form-fitting clothes or do
you like more loose baggy clothes like
do you like dark colors or do like
prints like what catches your eye more
and what do you think looks better
honestly and like yeah I definitely wear
whatever makes you happy don't listen to
what other people say about your style
like honestly wear what makes you happy
and what you feel confident with because
confidence honestly makes you look
better in anything I have one really
cute outfits but like if I'm not
confident it will show like it really
your confidence it really does show and
you can pull off anything when you're
confident and imagine how good you look
when you're already wearing a cute
outfit and you are confident yes Sara
what makes you happy and you will be
happy I know I'm definitely more happy
in the day like if I'm wearing a cute
outfit there's so many different styles
that you can choose from so I would
definitely advise like looking at
magazines and like going on tumblr and
like I do that I still do that I go on
Instagram I go to like those pages that
throw all those tumblr pictures out and
look at outfits that I like honestly
fashion should be taken as a fun thing
it's not a serious thing I mean
obviously del you need to get dressed
every day but I feel like it should be
looked at as something that's fun like
you're creating your own outfits you're
trying new things you're using your
brain to put together in our piece it
honestly fashion is art and you need to
have fun with it just remember to always
have fun with it and don't dress for
other people like I can't stress that
enough because confidence really does
show like if you were confident you're
gonna look good no matter what you're
wearing if you're confident in your
outfit nobody can tell you you feel good
in it that's the most important thing
honestly it is and you walk out there
knowing that you look good and what
you're wearing and you created it and
that's it it's just like anything else
you could do in your life I really hope
this helped you and gave you some advice
