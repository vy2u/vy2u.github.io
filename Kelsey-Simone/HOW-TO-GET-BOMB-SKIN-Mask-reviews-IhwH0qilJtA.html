to be talking to you about skincare
focusing mainly on face masks just to
keep your skin clean and clear and
beautiful for the upcoming school year
quick disclaimer I would not recommend
putting on all these face masks in one
day like I do this is just a sample and
show you guys the products that I'm
using in the video like I said I'm going
to be talking about mass and I'm going
to start off with my all-time the best
of all of them my favorite face mask
which is from glam glow this is their
Superman face mask any problem that you
could be having with your skin this will
fix it it washes out the dirt and toxins
left in your skin so it's like a really
super deep cleaning mask the k17 clay
that they use grabs all of the waste and
extracts it from your skin whether you
want just a super deep cleanse or if you
have acne prone skin and want to clear
it out this is great for that
this is something that's a specialty
mask I only use it once or twice a week
another amazing ingredient that this has
is activated X charcoal and what this
does is this helps to take out all the
extra oils in your skin but it doesn't
dry out your face which is amazing for
people like me who have dry skin but
still want to clear it out it has a ton
of good ingredients like cucumber aloe
peppermint and licorice which is exactly
what it smells like this gives my skin
is super fresh and refreshed feeling
because it is super deep cleansing and
the packaging is cute as well if you've
seen any of my other skincare videos
you'll know that I use galangal a lot
they have a really great mask that I use
all the time so whatever your skin type
is or whatever you're looking to fix on
your face they most likely have a mask
and a product that's gun for you aside
from detoxing and cleansing another
thing I really need to do is moisturize
my face because I have really dry skin
and what I like to use is the dr. jar
water max sleeping mask so this one you
can leave on overnight it kind of just
soaks into your skin and gives you
intense hydration and makes you look
really glowy this mask is enriched with
a lot of essential oils and it's
literally amazing you don't have to
sleep with it overnight you can leave
this on during the day if you're not
going to be wearing a lot of makeup it's
just something that you just sort of
leave on you don't really wash off and
your skin just soaks up everything
that's inside of it this mask doesn't
seem to have a lot of scent or fragrance
which I wish it did but it does have a
lot of good essential oils for your skin
like lavender rose sandalwood
and lemon because this mask isn't as
strong as the other ones you're able to
leave it on longer so just let it soak
into your skin like you would regular
lotion now if you want to detox but
still add a little bit of hydration what
I would recommend is the josie maran
whipped mud mask
this has argan oil in it which is one of
the best moisturizers for your skin
you'll notice a lot of moisturizers and
hydrating masks will have that
ingredient in it it does have this
whipped consistency which is kind of
like spreading butter on your face and
they don't actually say this but as you
can see it's kind of has a grainy
texture which lightly exfoliate so if
you kind of want to get the work out of
that and exfoliate a little bit then I
would recommend rubbing it in with your
hands no it does make this mask
different is it does have a little bit
of toner in it which the toning
ingredient is the Moroccan volcanic ash
which also like I said before the
volcanic helps with your pores which is
what the detox part of this mask is
because they're super popular right now
I thought I'd throw in a sheet mask for
you guys and this is a cucumber sheet
mask I love the scent of cucumber
cucumber is really good for cooling off
your skin for hydrating for sensitive
skin this is just something if your skin
needs like a 5-minute break if you're
really just out or you just want a quick
little mask this is something perfect
for you to put on it's not the cutest
mask in the world but it's great for a
quick little fixer-upper for your skin
for an under eye mask I'm using this
pearl eye mask from Sephora these just
feel so cooling and so nice these are
going to help replenish add moisture but
also brighten your under eyes say if you
got a really lack of sleep last night or
if you just had a lot of work to do
and you want to brighten up your under
eyes even out the tone under there then
this is perfect for a lip mask I also
have a Sephora wanna this is the shea
butter one which feels amazing basically
it's the same thing it's kind of like a
sheet mask but for your math you just
put it on there this is going to
moisturize and it's going to help with
any dryness that you have in there just
to repair your lips it's a quick little
lip fix that I love this is just going
to repair your dry lips and make them
look luscious and beautiful that's the
last mask that I have for you though now
your lips your under eyes your face are
looking flawless I hope this helped you
if it did please give it a thumbs up and
subscribe down below
I will see you guys in my next video and
I love you so much bye my skin is so
soft
