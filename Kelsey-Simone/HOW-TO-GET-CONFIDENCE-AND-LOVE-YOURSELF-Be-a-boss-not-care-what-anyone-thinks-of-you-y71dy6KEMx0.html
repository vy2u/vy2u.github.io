like a little talking video about a
topic that I get tons of questions on so
many that I was like why not just do a
whole video dedicated to it um I'm going
to try to make this like as a least
rambly and not like super long as
possible this is just sort of like chill
vibes we wanted this to be like we're
having a sleepover you know so I have
like this comfy really soft little furry
blanket again I have an iced coffee two
videos a week thing well so what I'm
going to be talking about that's
confident and loving yourself I get so
many questions on how I mean the
confidence how you can gain confidence
you know all that sort of stuff so I
thought I would start by giving you my
sort of a little personal backstory on
how I got my confidence I'm also going
to try to keep this at least serious as
possible because I feel like my whole
channel sort of has just like chill fun
like I don't want to be like a serious
video I'm not I'm not serious person
like at all so when I was little we go
way back in time like 2012 we're just
going back to like my preteen years I
feel like that sort of like the age when
everything happens there's like the
awkward stage in your life pretty much I
was like you know little insecure I'm
very easy to change myself depending on
like the people I was with so that I
would please them um which sort of when
you do that you're sort of putting that
other person in a higher position than
yourself if you're sort of making them
more important than you which I feel
like is a very bad mindset how about
yourself I feel like you should I'm not
going to put yourself first like you're
more in front of other people but like
when it comes to like opinions about
liking you and just the way that you are
I feel you should care about your
opinion of yourself versus other
people's opinions of yourself because
you should not try to alter yourself to
make other people happy you know I'm
going to give it one specific story but
there's like you know a bunch I could
choose from there was like this guy that
I had a crush on at the time that I
wouldn't you know course change my cell
phone he would like me I would wear
different things that he that I thought
he would think was cool or I would make
specific
she would find funny or I would pretend
to like certain music or like I would
talk a different way because I thought
it was like in Preston it was like a big
deal back then you know you're 12 and
you're like II think you're in love with
a boy it's not a big deal he of course
like rejected me and he was like it
sucks like all that time like all that
effort all that time I put in to making
myself so that you would like me and he
still didn't like me I was it what the
junk dude and that happened the friends
too like I we have this friend that I
really liked but I wanted her to be my
best friend and I would try so hard to
please her and she still really would
might be how much normally do come on so
once he stopped liking me I like you
know stop hogging him you know didn't
really either he wasn't in my life
anymore and also like randomly at the
same time I also have like no friends
like I had like no friends at this time
no besties no girls like hang out with
whatever so I like started doing things
for myself like I would like get dressed
in the morning for like example and just
like I would like pick out what I wanted
to wear instead of thinking about like
oh wait maybe I should wear that if
you'd think it was cool or like maybe I
should wear these pants because I know
my friends are going to be wearing
something like that like it was weird it
was like a whole change open I don't
have friends now I don't have this guy
to impress now like I just do it well I
didn't care I didn't have anybody to
impress also I feel like when this could
be related to whatever you're going
through right now in your life if you're
going through something when you're
going through something I feel like you
don't like you think it's like terrible
and you don't really know what the cause
of it's for like what's the reasoning
behind it was why is this happening to
me
I think what's something going through
something really like intense that's
what your first thing you think it was
why is this happening to me of course
everything that you go through happens
for a reason like there's going to be an
outcome there's going to be a change
whether you notice it right away you
could notice that years after it passes
you could never even end up knowing the
reason but it does affect you this is
going to sound really weird but I'm like
thankful for all the guys that like
rejected me and the girls who didn't
want to be my friends because none of
that would have happened if I wouldn't
have been like so all that bad stuff
didn't happen about I wouldn't be the
same person I am today which at the time
again I
cry all the time like God why do I have
no friends why am I so alone but I think
that alone time is good because like not
only did I learned to like do things for
myself and I'd be content with myself
and I confident in myself I also like
got closer to God through that when you
are in a long time or like a sad time
like you're I'm talking to God more like
I was praying to God more I was talking
to him more because I was going through
this struggle so it sort of like brought
us closer together like we're really
homey I know that God would never put
you through something that you're not
strong enough to go through and even if
you don't feel strong enough to go
through it he can give you like his own
strength so through being able to like
pray all the time and ask him sort of
for confidence because I was praying for
that at the time that of course
definitely like helped a lot as well I
need to take a step I'm talking so much
so long story short I got sick and tired
people's crap and I just started pray to
the Lord and then things got better yeah
and of course like I still have
insecurities today but it's different
than how I used to deal with it before
my mindset about myself is completely
different
my attitude towards myself is completely
different um I don't get jealous as
often but like if I do it's the way that
I handle the jealousy that really shows
a lot about you there are people who
would react badly and they would treat
her mean or they would like put her down
or they would just just I love your
friend because it makes them feel
personally insecure where me I sort of
like take that and I just sort of like
been inspired like when I see a girl who
I get jealous of I would get jealous of
them in a rude way where I'm like okay
I'm just not going to talk to her
because it makes me feel bad about
myself like I don't reflect her on
myself like I don't compare myself to
her I'm just like recognize that like
okay her outfits really cute
but I'll have to be like oh dang it my
outfit looks ugly you know I'm just
going to be like okay hers is cute let's
get inspiration from that like I'm going
to be friends with her and ask her where
her jeans are from you know something
else that I wanted to talk about really
quickly it was like the difference
between being cocky versus being
confident I've had where I will look at
myself in the mirror and just feeling
always look pretty and then something
will be like up like conceived as much
there's nothing wrong with thinking you
look as being content with yourself like
there's nothing wrong with that I feel
like that
like girls are sort of like they feel
like that like they feel like Oh like
I'm not allowed to like like the way
that I look because people are going to
think that I'm conceited where there's
nothing wrong with that as long as you
know the difference as long as you keep
a level head in mindset and also
understanding that sort of everybody's
equal I feel like there's this attitude
when you're cocky that you think you're
better than other people
I in no way think that I'm better than
anybody else like I don't think I have a
higher position in life I don't think
that I like deserve more I also don't
think that other people would have any
lower position than me it's a coffee
girl would walk into a room full of
people and just be like okay like I'm
the best working girl here like I look
cuter than all these people my outfits
nicer etc we're just confident girl
would walk into the room being like wow
okay I look good I like my outfit I may
not be the best person in this room like
because I know I have imperfections but
I'm content with the way that I am and
I'm not going to change myself because
of somebody up another thing that I
wanted to address that isn't really like
a dress in a lot of like videos talking
about confidence
look intimidation I feel like when
you're confident you become very
intimidating to people and I feel the
people you become intimidating to are
people who are very insecure like
flipside how when I was younger I used
to look at other girls and like compare
myself and then feel bad about myself
because I was intimidated by them if
they were intimidating like of course
back then I was insecure I would be
scared to be friends with them because
every time I hung out with them I would
just hate on myself in my head and just
did something odd like I wish my hair
looks like that I could never look like
her body's better than mine whatever and
that makes you intimidating which to
insecure people these in deter people
not want to be around you of course when
you have another person who sort of they
have the right minds that they're
content with themselves they don't
compare themselves to you or if they do
they don't beat themselves up about it
they sort of get inspired from you and
they'll you know they'll hype you up
because they think you cute you know I
really like using word buttons but I
don't really know how to explain it is
when you sort of get confident you give
off confident side
I guess like I don't really know how to
explain it but it's so true like when
you see who are walking down the street
you can just like automatically see that
she's really confident and it's really
attractive it is like it just shows that
you're very competent person and it sort
of like contagious in a way I believe my
way that you're built like a natural
defense mechanism for like warding off
the people who are meant to be in your
life and then like bringing in the
people who are because obviously like if
they don't like you with you are if you
like me why do you hear them so I'm
going to make like an analogy um using
like a Gucci purse this is going to be
weird but I swear it'll make that hold
on
so the Gucci purse is going to represent
your things that make you different as a
person so people who have Gucci bags it
stands out if you're in a room with a
bunch of girls and this one girl has
like a nice designer bag on you're kind
of going to look at her and just be like
well like look at her designer bag which
you're not going to look at her like
soft everybody has thoughts every single
person that room is socks and autistic
moms well look at her top chair to think
about whoa look at that bad because
nobody else has that back it stands out
it's cool like Gucci bags wouldn't be as
cool it's every single person on the
planet had a Gucci bag it's not that
nice where I feel like saying that make
you different like it's attractive to
the eye
some people may respond negatively where
those are vintage your people because
they're jealous because they can't have
the bags to themselves where the same
sort of thing goes for your differences
people will notice that about you you
have getting kind of cold
of course my like experience in my store
how about confidence it's going to be
different for everybody not everybody is
going to gain it the same sort of way
but I feel like if you're feeling in
confident with yourself right now just
just just know that should be fool me I
would really just start eliminating
toxic people from your life that's
definitely the first thing that helps me
was sort of people who either make you
feel a certain way about yourself or if
they put you down about yourself you
know whatever just talks to people in
your life I would definitely eliminate
those first I'd rather have no friends
and bad friends which I've gone to that
season so many times and surround
yourself with people who are confident
because it's definitely one of those
things that can rub off like very easily
I feel like what you
hang out with people who are very
confident or like just have that sort of
positive energies yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope that it was
helpful to you I hope that I didn't
ramble too much and leave some comments
