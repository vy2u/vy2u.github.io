a video that was actually requested by
you guys in my last video I talked about
how I wanted to grow my hair out and
that I use extensions and I asked you
guys if you wanted a video about my
extensions the type I have the brand I
wear all of that stuff so I decided I'd
do it basically these are my sentence I
have them in right now they are curled
my natural hair um is about up to where
my collarbone is I don't wear them on an
everyday basis I kind of normally wear
them when I'm going out when I have a
party or something special to go to or
just when I feel like looking good for
the day but I love the way they look I
feel like they look really natural the
brand of extensions that I use is called
irresistible me and you can get them
online I have the box it comes in a
little black box and it's really cute so
cute and so basically it comes with
extra clips it comes with a four clip
piece three clip pieces two clips and
also single Clips which I actually
really like because my last extension
set didn't have that which is basically
a single extension clip that I like to
put up right in the front so it helps my
bangs to blend better the color that I
use is natural black because my hair is
really dark and they have tons of colors
that you can pick out their color
matches perfectly with my color which is
great I will leave the website below and
they actually gave me a coupon code that
you guys can use type in irresistible
Kelsey and you can get 10% off so
basically you buy the whole set of
extensions and you can also get the
biggest on wet that you can get is the
for clip one which I like to put right
on the top so it looks like really nice
and blended you can actually buy that
like individually if you wanted to um
but I just got like the whole the whole
shebang so the price of these extensions
honestly wasn't that bad compared to
like other really like popular hair
extension brands um their quality is
amazing and I really loved it the
shipping was fast it literally got here
in like less than a week and I'm really
happy with it this is what a single um
extent would look like this is just the
two clip one that I actually use on the
sides so how I set it up what I do and I
do a three clip a three clip the big 4
clip on the top two two pieces on the
sides and
and the single piece is in the front and
it sounds like a lot but if you want to
have thicker fuller hair and have it
look more natural and blended then you
need to use more pieces this hair feels
amazing you can use heat on it I
normally like to wear mine curly I just
feel like it's easier to blend them when
they're curled um and it looks really
playing I'll show you the back this is
the back of my hair like a panty model
right now but it's really simple to do
on your own it's very easy to get a hang
of this my hair in a middle part um you
can do whatever kind of part you want I
just like to do a middle part so
basically I part my hair with my fingers
make the part with your hair make it
super straight and then you just
literally clip in the clips and that's
all you have to do and then pull another
section of hair over the top and do the
same thing till you got your hair so
like I said the clips on are heat
resistant so you can totally curl them
straighten them do whatever you can even
wash them because it is real human hair
the hair that I have I will leave the
link of like the literal exact hair that
I have in the descriptions you can like
get the same type and just like pick
your color whatever they actually had a
video that was really helpful for me
that I used where it's like a video that
shows all the different colors of hair
that they have and then I was able to
like look at it and then just kind of
like figure out what color was best for
me so how I style my extensions I'm not
going to go into like a full-out blown
um hair tutorial if you guys want that
let me know but normally one way silent
is how I just have it now is totally
just down and simple but I'm also high
like to wear them is in a ponytail
um ponytails are one of my favorite
things to do with my long hair
extensions because I literally can't
wear ponytails with my short hair which
is really annoying um so I love wearing
ponytails and they look so cute
expecially when the hair is curled so I
love that messy buns are a lot easier on
with your extensions in because messy
buns are easier when you have long hair
because you don't have all those short
pieces popping out and not to mention I
also love wearing it with mom hats
because um who doesn't love a good mom
hat so this is cute should I keep this
on for the rest of the video I'm going
to do that um so yeah I'm obsessed with
these extensions I love that
definitely compared to the ones that I
used to have that I used to wear these
are just so much better
they hold a curl amazing as you can tell
look at the curls right here they're so
nice and they're easy to straighten
again um so to get them back to straight
from this curl is totally easy no
problem you can wash them which I love
about it and they're very easy to dry I
just kind of let them like hang dry I
will show you guys a close-up of the
hair so these are the single clip wets
are honestly so helpful when selling
your hair you have the four clip one
which is amazing and it has this really
thick top part which um makes it look
which gives you a lot of volume which is
why I like to put it on the top then we
also have the three clips as well as the
two clips um so you you don't have to
follow like the same placement that I do
definitely whatever works with your hair
that's just what I like to do I like to
thank irresistable me for giving me
these beautiful extensions and also
giving you guys the discount code which
again like I said will be um right here
I'll put it right here
there it is by the way I just want to
say before I get any nasty comments or
