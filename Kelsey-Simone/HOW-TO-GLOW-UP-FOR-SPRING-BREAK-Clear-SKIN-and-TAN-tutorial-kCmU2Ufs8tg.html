the bathroom there's not actually wet
it's just for few SEC so today I'm going
to be doing seriously like my most
requested video ever because they're
always asking me how I keep my skin
really clear how I keep it glowing and
also like how I maintain a safe tan I
thought that this would be like the
perfect time to do one of these videos
because spring break is coming up
everybody wants know how to create their
skin and you want to know how to get
like glowy tan skin because we're all
kind of look good on spring break and I
did want to mention the city of self
sponsors these are honestly all my
favorite products so I also quickly once
mentioned this is not in everyday
routine I don't even want to try to lie
like I do this every day if you have a
room I highly suggest you put it on into
it come see with me so starting off my
skincare routine I always remove my
makeup first I'm not wearing any makeup
right now so that's my number one tip
never sleep with your makeup on I
honestly in a year maybe even two years
it's been I have not slept with makeup
on so if I should have makeup on I would
use an oil melt to remove my makeup may
seem like intimidating and fancy and
expensive but this is literally just
coconut oil you can get like a big jug
of this at the food store of like six
dollars so what I do is I take like a
little scoop out of it and I'll work it
into my skin and circular motions just
sort of like a massage you know I'm
there and just wash it off with water
just like a regular face wash this will
cut through any makeup like even
waterproof mascara winged eyeliner matte
liquid lipsticks this gets through every
after you remove your makeup you have to
clean your skin again I don't do this
every night but you should clean your
skin after you remove your makeup so the
first one that I have here is the pasty
glow monitor which I've talked about
this before this was amazing and then
from lush I have the aqua marina face
block it has seaweed in it which I love
how also stay hydrated tip number two
next after you cleanse your face I will
turn my face and this is the only one I
use I use this fresh rose floral toner
since it just makes toning so much
easier it's just in a mist like that's
so simple even I can't screw it up just
super soothing it refreshes and hydrogen
just in and this is really good also if
you have sensitive skin and then the
next step is to exfoliate your face I
feel like this is really important for
me because I have super dry skin so I
honestly have not had like a favorite
exfoliator until recently an entire time
this product this is the tarte friction
stick so it makes exfoliating really
quick and just really practical and easy
and literally a stick you just kind of
like rub all over your face and then you
just rinse it off and it really leaves
your skin oh my god feeling so smooth
and then face mask recently my favorite
and the meat fresh road fix mask I'm
telling you right now everything in here
is going to be rose so this is a
gorgeous glass container and it has like
a real rose pills in it
sigit stuff is amazing for dry skin is
super hydrating and just super like
soothing and relaxing and refreshing you
really feel like you're at a spa when
you do this or I will just do sheet
masks this one is a rose blossom just
like a Japanese sheet mask I get all of
my like sheet masks and eye masks and
stuff like that as a story calm I think
it's supposed to be like factory but
like space because it's like spaceman
and they do do me like a 20 percent off
thing for you guys so I'll leave that
below the next we have moisture Iser I
am moisturize religiously I'm waster
eyes my face like 4 times a day and that
may sound a really extra but my skin is
so dry so these have been my favorite
ones lately this is the fresh fluid
youth preserve cream and fun fact the
size rooms in coconut my other favorite
scent is cucumbers and this one's
amazing I was like running really low I
need to get another one this is the
title brightening advent water cream by
Sunday Riley actually recommended to me
by my friend Riley they're becoming one
of my nuclear skincare brands they
actually have like really good stuff
this isn't really like a creamy lotion
it's more like a water gel lotion which
I really like also this smells and has
seaweed in it which I recently found out
it like really good for moisturizing
your skin so every time something has to
be in it I need to get it my lips are
always chapter you around I don't know
if that's just me but they already need
to do moisturize so the two top things
I'll use is get or doesn't a really
intense lip balm or in oil this is the
far solid rose gold elixir which is the
one that likes
everybody uses on Instagram it has all
the link go little Sexton it or I will
use this lip balm which is I think the
branch is called RSS but this is the
bramble berry and Rose lip balm you can
get these unities all over the place
actually I bought mine in anthropology
those last but definitely not least you
guys know how to throw this in the air I
used rose water literally every single
day announcing on to the body the first
thing I do obviously linky you would
wash your body it was the first thing I
do actually like beauty care wise is
isolating my skin another quick tip is
exfoliate and right before you shave it
before you prime your shaving cream it
will get rid of all the like top layer
of skin and just makes your skin is so
smooth you will have the perfect shave
it also makes sure to fully eight right
before I put on big tanner it helps your
fake tan not to look so blocking because
again it takes off that top layer of
dead skin so the major exfoliator that I
use I use the rub rub rub from lush I
also use the ocean salt which is a
little bit more intense than the rubber
rub I think that was better but I just
kind of I just kind of go back and forth
and use both or I will use this one
which is from Harper and Lee and this is
a coffee scrub this smelled exactly like
coffee I'm really hungry now then you
need to moisturize your body which I
normally don't wish eyes my whole body
right before a ton of big Tanner because
I feel like sometimes a lotion can like
interfere with a big Tanner
but I do moisturize like super drug
pressing my elbows my knees my feet my
hands you probably like what is this
this is some Bobbi Brown and this is the
extra bomb rinse I like that it's called
extra see I convinced myself that this
is just lemon curd in a jar like I want
to spread it on the croissant
this kind of of the texture of like
Vaseline but a little bit more spin in
light and smell as this gets me in the
happiest who would ever spend for my
actual fake Tanner you guys already know
what I'm going to say is loving hands
they are the only tanning company I use
I have never gone back to using anything
else after this this is honestly it's so
good I just go to our Express because
I'm lazy and I hate waiting for to dry
and use it with their applicator mint I
just pump it on here just swirl it
around I love just putting like bold
shimmery just body oils and moisturizers
on when I
can it just need to look like a golden
glow and goddess so this is a Sharon
body oil eyes opposite Urban Outfitters
and it smells amazing it hydrates your
tan and it just has all these beautiful
gold glittery flecks and the last step
is you got the smell Road grammar I love
English the first thing that I have is
the Jo Malone velvet rose and bood dry
body oil this stuff smells crazy intense
but this stuff this is a little bit
better than a perfumed because like I
said it's a dry oil so the oil will
stick onto your skin and lasts a lot
longer than a perfume will then I have
my coconut perfume which I've tossed out
before you can get the fact orbit
Outfitters it's on the same brand as the
Sherman body oil but it just makes you
smell like a coconut and then another
new favorite is the Erin amber musk
perfume this has been my everyday sign
I'm obsessed with this
so I hope that this was helpful to you I
hope that you maybe even found some new
favorite product if this video thumbs up

below make sure to subscribe as well I
love you guys so much and I will see you
in my next video can't open can you shut
up I'm probably not even going to use

your lawn when you try to be cute and it
doesn't work

inspired by mermaids which tells the
mermaid eyelash extensions just in case
