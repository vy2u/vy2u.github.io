whip it right over in nice God win hey
guys so today I'm going to be doing like
a little video on my hair on the YouTube
channel you guys have sort of seemed
like my whole hair growth timelines my
hair used to be really really short and
it was damaged in growth I had this
horror story of bleaching it and it was
like falling out and I had so many split
ends it was so dry and damaged and
terrible now my hair is getting back to
a nicer stage I get so many questions on
like how did you grow your hair so
quickly how did you get it to look not
dead I thought I would just do like a
little video showing you the products
that I use washing it tips everything I
do this video isn't sponsored it's just
obviously all the stuff that I use my
shampoo conditioner stuff I used to
style it etc any I just started talking
about my growth how I grew it so quickly
it was so quick that you guys actually
thought I wearing like extension um I
straightened it to conceal a the actual
length of how long is guide um yeah it
got so long I know I have very very
curly hair like my natural hair super
curly editing Kelsey it will put a
picture here but I have really curly
natural hair so this will also be like
products that are good for curly hair
how to take care of super curly hair all
that sort of stuff like as well as like
growing my hair but also like taking
care of it you know the first thing I
did was I cut my hair and I dyed it all
black yeah I'm not going you to go and
cut your hair but trimming the dead ends
off pretty consistently is really good
because it helps your hair grow
healthier and I guess or involve dead
ends there's really so mean with curly
hair like it's really important but I do
not wash my hair every day very very
highly suggest do not wash your hair
every single day it shifts your hair of
its natural oils and it's going to make
your hair super dry so especially if you
already have dry hair do not wash it
that much having curly hair I only wash
my hair about once or twice a week and
what I do the first thing I do is I
shampoo my hair is just just regularly
go just shampoo my hair just focusing on
the roots mainly and then I'll rinse
that out and that'll take my conditioner
and I'll only go down the bottom half of
my hair you don't really want to put
conditioner
the top of your head because you don't
want it in your roots because it'll make
your hair really greasy so I put my
condition has a lot of half of my hair
and I'll let that sit in I don't rinse
it out right away I'll do everything
else in the shower and then right before
I get out I'll rinse it out and while
I'm letting the conditioner sit in I'll
pretty much do every single thing else
I'll wash my body I'll accelerate my
skin which I do pretty much all the time
I'll wash my face I'll shave I'll do all
that stuff you much keep your
conditioner and as long as possible at
the least
I'll keep it in for like five minutes
but I think pretty long showers so I
normally have it in probably really good
10-15 minutes I found that doing that
helps my hair so much it's pretty much
like doing a deep conditioning treatment
like once or twice a week for your hair
which is so incredibly good for your
hair the shampoo and conditioner that I
use is actually a drugstore break so
this is super affordable so if you're
looking for something affordable it's
not like a crazy expensive salon shampoo
conditioner you can buy this la
Walgreens Target I just get my net
target this is from OGX
I'm pretty sure the Nemo's I think I've
talked about this before you guys
actually so this is the quenching
coconut curls conditioner and shampoo
they have a ton of different ones like
depending on your hair type but because
I have curls is a coconut this up smells
amazing too because it's all coconut so
it like smells super nice yeah so this
is the stuff that I use and I swear by
this stuff anybody I know who has curly
hair or even just damaged hair I highly
recommend this stuff to you they have a
coconut shampoo and conditioner one
that's not for curls like it just like a
coconut hydrating one so if you have
straight hair and you don't really want
the curly one you can get that one as
well
so it's also really important is this
stuff is sulfate free which basically
means because I dye my hair it's not
going to like strip all the color off
while I'm washing it um so yeah that's
pretty good this is coconut oil honey
citrus oil like tons of really good
hydrating agents in it have you seen my
videos you always know that it we talked
about having to listen to rice skin ever
and now I'm talking about hi um the most
dry hair ever I'm just drying over this
stuff oh this stuff is amazing like I
swear like the only reason my hair looks
good and it grew so
because of this stuff like this stuff is
amazing and it's so inexpensive like
it's so expensive which is really good
also randomly I don't do this that much
but I will also do like a hair mask
randomly when I feel like my hair is
looking a little bit not as good as
normal
I don't know English um yeah what I feel
like my hair is just not looking that
great I will do like a hair mask on top
of like well on top I'll normally do it
after the shower I know that they say
don't brush your hair when it's wet
because it will cause split ends
but whoever whoever said that does not
have curly hair just just don't brush
your dry curls just please don't do that
my curls I can't brush my dry hair
unless it's strained when it's
straightened back in Russia is the
tangle tweezer and they set up like a
bunch of these to me and they're so nice
they have like all these like little
hair brushing like particles again I
don't know English really good at
brushing your hair and just getting out
the knots without like feeling like
you're pulling your hair out of your
hand you know once my hair has been
washed brushed possibly masked then dry
it on for drying this may be different
for everybody you like if your hair is
like a different hair type but at least
for me personally air drying is the only
way to go I don't blow dry my hair I
don't tell dry my hair I just find that
my natural curls look so much better
when it just air dries when I just let
it air dry naturally like my curls are
really spiraling they're not it's frizzy
it's not as big and crazy you know what
I'm saying where if I were to blow-dry
it it would be an afro or if I were to
let it dry in a towel it would take for
cover or if I really fought it it would
just look insane I used to hate wearing
my curly hair but now I love it I do
wear my curly hair a lot but I do also
commonly wear it straight a lot I feel
like because I don't wash it as much
heat is not as big of a problem because
I don't have to straighten it as much as
if I were watching it every day and then
straightening it every day so for
products that I use for styling my hair
again I'll normally use really hydrating
products because I want my hair to look
sort of shiny and hydrated and at least
like dry as possible you know so again
lots of coconut products meet all these
three are actually by the same brand the
OGX brand that my shampoo
conditioner from Caesar all drugstore
they're very affordable and they're so
nice they smell like insanely good
they're gonna make your hair smell
amazing but I have coconut water coconut
milk and coconut oil
I'll just normally spray these at the
bottom of my hair and scrunch it again I
don't play at the roots because you
don't want your hair look greasy but the
coconut milk is really good it's sort of
like a thicker consistency that I just
put like a little bit in my fingertips
run it through normally some doing more
like a sleek look you know and then the
coconut water in the coconut oil our
spray bottles so I'll just sort of
spritz this in my hair just if I feel
like they need a little bit of shine at
the ends or if they just need a little
like boost you know and then if my hair
is already curly and it's like natural
and I'm styling it just like that for
the day I'll use wave spray a lot I know
you can use like crowing things too like
scrunch your hair I have them as those
too but I normally don't like them as
much they tend to like make my hair
sticky I don't know I just prefer using
like a sort of beachy wave spray I just
like the effect that it gives my curl so
I'll normally spray this all throughout
my hair and just sort of run my fingers
through it chocolate and scrunch it a
bit this is also really good when I'm at
the beach or like the pool or something
when I'm swimming in my hair is wet and
that's going to air dry and I want it to
look really nice just without having to
do it wave spray helps my hair dry so
pretty I have to this one you can get
from Urban Outfitters this is from the
gnarly whale this is their coconut milk
in peaches which just I know it sounds
amazing it smells so good I need to get
a new one because there's like that much
in the bottom like I've used this whole
entire thing just this summer and then
this one is from way this is just their
wave spray the reason I really like this
one is because it doesn't make your hair
hard and crunchy which I feel like a lot
of waves braids do that it actually has
a lot of oils in it so it'll keep your
hair hydrated as well as like giving
that same like wave effect and this one
smells really good too this one smells
like more like perfume II like a really
like high-end nice perfume I don't know
I love this all of this stuff and the
bottle is super aesthetic so so like I
said before actual like curling stuff
that you would like put in curly hair
for like sort of like be frizzy and
stuff like that I have this one which is
the frizz defy
curl styling milk which is from again
same brand the OGX brand they have the
best hair care like seriously the best
subs actually from the same like
collection as the shampoo and
conditioner value so it's really nice
this you just sort of pump it in and
just sort of like scrunch it into your
curls it just sort of helps your curls
to form better as well as for them not
to be super like frizzy you know dry
shampoo is my entire life like I said I
normally only wash my hair once or twice
a week so in between that I'm definitely
using a dry shampoo this one that I have
here is the Elizabeth and James white
this is like their perfume which I have
I talked about how much I loved it
before so this smells amazing it smells
just like the perfume and so it gives
you both the effects of making hair
smell great as well as sort of drying up
your roots which is really nice I've
been really wanting to try the one from
dry bar my friend recommended it to me
and tons of people have talked about it
before so I really want to try it I
haven't tried it yet but I've heard it's
like a really good dry shampoo and then
also I do this sort of like sleek look a
lot which is very hard when you have
like curly or frizzy hair so often I'll
use like a finishing cream this is the
only one that I have this is the way one
but I do really like it I just sort of
put a little bit of it in the tip of my
fingers and just sort of like lead to my
hair down with it if that makes sense it
gives a really nice sleek effect without
having my hair look greasy at all which
is like perfect the last part that I
have is another way product I really
like their stuff but this is like a
little travel one which I'm obsessed
with I don't know why I love travel
products I love all these little minis
plus I had Robin a lot recently so it's
like really great but this is their
texturising hairspray I use this a lot
as well I know the dry shampoo can like
also give you a lot of volume in your
hair but sometimes I feel like it does
get like a little flat you know so I'll
put this in my hair sort of with the
same method of direction I feel like
I'll spray to my roof and then I'll like
take my fingers and just sort of like go
like that if that makes any sense and it
just gives super volume this is really
good if you're trying to master the
perfect messy bun yep so that's pretty
much it for products probably my hair
I'll either wear it like straight like
this or I'll wear it curly either or
whatever you feel like doing it's really
simple I don't have any like really
crazy insane like hats for growing your
hand long or anything it's just sort of
I feel like you
really like hydrating and nourishing
products like I said doing the deep
conditioning thing I feel like that
helped me so so much like I feel like my
hair would not be as good as it is now
if I didn't like do that all the time
it's so helpful hope that you were able
to gain something from this if you're
trying to grow your hair out or if you
just a curling hair and you want to know
how to style it give this video a thumbs
