going to be talking about something that
was really requested which is my self
tanning routine and now tanning is
something people normally do in the
summer I like to keep my tan year I
think that I look better with the tan I
mean I like to look lively and very
glowy throughout the winter as well if
you want to know my like at-home sunless
really easy beginner friendly self
tanning routine then keep watching first
thing I start off with when I fake tan
is you have to shave you have to remove
all the hair on your body it is just
going to make sure that you get a really
smooth application of the Tanner and
that your legs look flawless and also
smooth and tan legs are a really good
combination
once it that I have is try not to use
any like oily body lotions or body
washes after your shower before you put
on your tanner because they won't mix
well and the Tanner won't stick to your
skin which is not good but also what I
do is I like to exfoliate I like to take
this this scrubs off all the dead skin
this is really important before you tan
if you don't have an exfoliator what you
can use is an exfoliating mitt I really
love using these I have one from loving
tan this is my favorite exfoliating mitt
so this is just going to do the same
thing as the exfoliator but make it a
little bit easier so when it comes to
shaving sometimes I'll actually shave
like the day before or a couple hours
before I put on my tanner because I find
that I get these like brown dots on my
legs and when I put my tanner on like
right after I get out the shower and
shave so I'll wait a little while
because I found out that it's actually
the tear getting stuck inside of my
pores so you want to like just give it
some time after you shave to let your
pores close so that you don't get like
those brown dots I apply a little bit of
moisturizer just on the parts of your
body that are super dry that you don't
want too much tanner sticking to which
are places like your elbows your knees
your hands and your feet so what I used
to like actually apply my tan is a mitt
and I use the loving tan mitt it is my
favorite mitt you definitely do not do
not try to apply tan without using a
mitt you will get stains a fake tanner
on your hands and all on your nails and
it's just not going to look good make
sure to use a mitt please the loving tan
mitt is my favorite it gets super smooth
I love how soft the mitt is the
Lovington mitt is super velvety so it
applies though Tanner so smoothly and I
just never get streaks when I
this so the Tanner that I use is the
loving tan to our Express deluxe of
bronzing mousse in the color dark I find
that I like the mousse a lot better just
because I feel like it gives a really
smooth application I use the color dark
because I like to be darker tan but
don't worry if you're a little bit
scared of fake tanning they do have a
medium which is a lot lighter than the
dark one I'm using which honestly is a
pretty comfortable color and the 2ir
Express is totally my favorite tanner
because I'm that sort of last minute
person where I will forget to do the
most important thing like 30 minutes
before leaving so this will develop in
two hours really quick drying as well so
you don't have to like wait a half an
hour to get dressed like it's quickly
drying and then it will develop in two
hours so say you have like a last minute
thing like dinner prom homecoming
whatever you can apply this before you
put your dress on before you do your
makeup and just let it dry let it
develop and by the time you get to what
you're doing you're already tinned you
don't have to wait overnight you don't
have to wait like 24 hours or like what
other cans do so that's really great
also it is buildable color which I use
that factor a lot so I will take the
dark and sometimes I find it won't be
dark enough you can totally add another
layer two layers whatever until you find
that you just like the way it looks
so the buildable color is great also
unlike other retainers it doesn't dry
out my skin which is really great
because you guys know I love having like
hydrated glowy skin so it doesn't dry
out your skin it has tons of really good
ingredients like aloe vera pomegranate
coffee things that are good for your
skin so it's super hydrating and
nourishing for your skin which is like
great so I rub that all over my whole
body when blending your tan out work in
a really quick circular motion I find
this causes no streaks this helps get
rid of any imperfections or any future
patches and then you wait for to dry
while you're waiting for it to dry wear
some darker colored loose-fitting
clothing one you don't want to stay in
your PJs and two you don't want to mess
up the tan if it's still a little bit
wet and tacky on your skin say for some
reason you didn't want your tan anymore
it's really easy to remove it obviously
with water it's not going to just like
come off I just take my exfoliating mint
get in the shower with warm water get
some like body wash on there
I will just scrub it all off and
sometimes if I find there's like those
little stubborn areas of tan like right
at rest or your feet that just don't
want to come off
I'll take lemon juice and sugar rub that
on and then it just like gets everything
right off once your skin feels dry to
the touch you can go ahead and put your
clothes on so once I'm done developing I
like to add on loving tans bronze
shimmer luminous cream I put this on
after it's developed it makes your tan
glow it moisturizes it and it makes you
look so pretty and adds a little bit of
depth whether you use whatever color
they have ultra dark dark and medium
another thing I find this is helpful for
so after a couple of days once my tan is
sort of dying down I can add this lotion
on top of it to give a little bit extra
boost to the Tam that it doesn't have
since I've been wearing it for about
four to five days depending on how
strongly I need it I'll use the medium
dark or ultra dark to add more color
that is my loving tan any routine so if
you like having a tan or even if you've
never tanned before I feel like this is
a really good routine that you can use
and I hope it was helpful to you give
