something that was super requested by
you guys last week I asked if you wanted
to see a video on how to look super like
dope bad and boozy but like on a budget
because I know I get a lot of comments
always like oh you are so much designer
stuff everything you wear is so
expensive but you want to get like that
look you want to look super trendy and
cute but like don't want to spend that
much money and yeah I feel that I get
you because there's a lot of time that I
wear outfits that are so like whoa dude
where'd you get that but my outfit is
like $30 also I narrowed it down to five
tents I wanted to make this video kind
of short because I hate when people
ramble with advice for 25 minutes on
YouTube so the first thing I'm going to
be talking about I get so many questions
about literally everywhere and I never
really know how to talk about it or
bring it up I always get comments about
my designer sayings and like oh that's
so expensive you're wasting money for
example my Cartier rings I actually have
four of these I have three gold ones and
a silver one okay by the way Kelsey
Simone at merch website linked below
uh-huh so the cartier rings are
seventeen hundred and seventy dollars
for a ring it cost like $20 each yeah
they're fake I get so many hate comments
and people telling me oh my god you're
so bougie you waste your money like
what's wrong with you they're fake
they're not real the way I look at it
I'm not saying every single thing that I
have is fake but the way that I think
about it is why would I spend like say
$3,000 on a pair of shoes when they're
kids that don't even have shoes to me
that's just the way I think about it
like I just don't feel right doing that
so I mean I like spending my money a
little bit more wise if I was going to
spend $1700 on something it's not going
to be a ring you know it would be on
something a little bit more useful
they're actually Instagram pages that I
know of that sort of like tell you where
I got my stuff and like how to get my
look and a lot of the time they get it
wrong because I wear stuff that looks
designer but is it for example there was
this top that I wore I'll put the
Instagram picture up here that you saw
in my last haul that I got from zaple
and even though they sent it to me it's
like under 15 bucks and it looks like a
shirt that's like $200 and that's what
they that's where they said I got it
from
didn't actually get it from there there
are tons of websites that will remake
stuff that's really trendy for so much
less where you honestly don't even have
to get exact look-alikes there were
these snap pants I wear them on my
Instagram and on my merch page Instagram
and a lot of people wanted to know where
they're from I know tons of celebrities
have been wearing snap pants like this
and the ones that can cry - you more
probably over $400 the ones that I wore
I left them for 30 bucks I'll link a
bunch of websites down below that I shop
on this is not sponsoring they're just
like a bunch of websites that I know
that there's something's really good I
personally shot this there are a lot of
websites that will make stuff that's on
trend but you don't have to pay $100 for
it like you don't have to get the
name-brand stuff to look name-brand if
you know what I'm saying yeah there's so
much stuff that you would never even
guess that I wear all the time that
people think I spend all this money on
like I mean I have a problem I do spend
a lot of money on clothes there are some
things that people would just be like oh
my god like how much did you spend on
that and I'm like 20 bucks
loke forever 21 is broke bushi heaven
like you can get so many cute things
fetch my rhinestone bralette that people
pay so much money for those things I
bought mine at forever 21 for $10 if you
really look no offense forever 21 but
you have a lot of stupid stuff if you
really look like if you really dig deep
like you got to get deep in there you
can size to do stuff tip number two um
is probably my favorite tip it's my
go-to tip it's one that I feel like
everybody should follow and it is the
way you wear your clothes and your
confidence
don't let the clothes wear you you wear
the clothes I feel like if you really
bring a lot of confidence and you know
how to rock something you can literally
wear whatever and look good have you
ever looked at a celebrity I do this all
the time where I look at a model or
celebrity and it'll be like oh my god
she looks so good she looks so cute I'm
even screenshotting the picture and
she's literally just wearing like a
hoodie and vans and leggings like
something I'm probably wearing while
looking at the picture but it's like she
looks so good now what is it's the way
that they present themselves in the
outfit they're very confident it's the
way they're posing it's their facial
expression it's just the way they wear
the outfit if you put that hoodie on any
any other person that wouldn't look
exactly the same unless that person had
a
the confidence and wore the hoodie you
know what I'm saying don't wear the
hoodie wear ability like where the
hoodie I don't know if that made sense
at all but okay and you need to just be
content in the way that you look just be
like I look good I'm rocking this like I
literally just wearing a hoodie right
now and I bet you so many of you are
probably already like Oh where's your
hoodie from all she looks super cute I'm
just wearing a hoodie dude
like it's actually um my hoodie it's my
merch honey so hit it up go get it
I feel like just get get some confidence
but don't be cocky with it I feel like
don't get to the point where you think
you look better than everybody else you
got to say level-headed in your mind I
look at all girls as equal and I don't
think I'm better than anybody else or
like better than any other girl I'm
doing me I know that I look good and
that doesn't make me conceited do you
know what I'm saying like it's not a
crime to be okay with the way that you
look I feel like people normally look at
girls like the second we look in the
mirror and say like oh I look really
pretty
people like conceited that's not
conceited it's just being content with
the way that you are and there's nothing
wrong with that I don't need to turn
this into a preachy thing but I feel
like it's really important to be
profiting yourself the third tip that I
have I also get so many questions about
is directing stuff I always talk about
I've mentioned a couple times that oh I
hope this from a thrift store oh I
started this and people are like how how
do you do this if you try to look dope
on a budget their stores are your best
friend
goodwill is going to be your straight-up
homie don't expect the first time you go
to thrift store to just be like blasted
with all of these cool things you got a
like a really take time on a piece I
wanted to show you where these silk
button-up shirts I have this one in like
this creamy white color and in black
silk definitely looks expensive if I
tied this and like a little wrap top
with some cute little layered gold
chokers you would look so expensive in
so height but like you spent like $10
another thing that I selected that most
people pay so much for our mom jeans
I thought these Levi's they're just
black high-waisted mom jeans that I sort
of like DIY myself I'm really short so
jeans are always like super long on me
so I put them on I cut them where I
wanted
I took the edge of my scissors and just
like shredded them and then I also made
like little upward slit Serban cells
they're like redone Levi's
jeans for like what seventy five eighty
dollars versus five dollars in five
minutes of labor like it's just it's
such a better idea don't like just look
in your side like I don't only look in
the small I do look in the men's because
you find great stuff t-shirt dresses
hoodies by make sure it's all kind of
cool stuff in the men's but I also look
into pretty much every size I look
through every rap go through all of them
these I found in the largest like you
never know then I don't know if you guys
remember this little this thing from my
Instagram a little while ago this was
just a turtleneck like ribbed sweater
that I bought and I literally just cut
it in shredded it with others it took my
mom five minutes to do this
fourth tip that I have is looking super
extra which that's kind of like
self-explanatory but like the reason
behind it and do you ever see
celebrities or gurus you just look in
people who wear like white v-neck pocket
Target t-shirts no they wear things that
are super out there something that
nobody has if you're trying to look
really bougie which I look really bad
you can't wear things but everybody in
the world has and I'm not saying you
have to dress super extra every single
day I don't dress extra every single day
but I have my days here and there where
I'm just really feeling it and I'm like
I'm gonna do I'm gonna be out there
today I'm just going to wear whatever I
want yeah some staple pieces that are
like super cool and out there that are
really good for styling finding your own
style get some things that are a little
bit out there that not necessarily
everybody wears and everybody has which
again pulls into the whole thrifting
thing in thrift stores you can find
stuff that's one-of-a-kind that nobody
else had last tip that I have is
something I also live by religiously and
it's accessorized let me give you a good
example I've gone out right now this is
a look right I got my sunny is my cute
little hoops my sag
you know everything looking good right
if I took all this stuff off I'm just
wearing a hoodie like it's not as cool
it doesn't have as much interest you
know you got to have things that are
going to pull you in that has interest
that sort of like make the outfit it's
like the icing on the cake and some
people just like icing I just like I
think I didn't eat the cake I only like
the icing this is not even an analogy
anymore accessorizing is something
that's really important to me really
really important I feel like it really
makes a look you can have the most basic
thing and accessorize it so flawlessly
and have it look like such a unique cool
trendy look and because literally just
be a white top with blue jeans but if
you have sick killer boots are really
cool out there backpack maybe it's got
like a cool print on it you've got some
bomb like sunglasses these are like this
really cool shape I've been like
obsessed with these I got these from
Topshop get some out there sunglasses
you know get a lik pop and lip color odd
maybe stack some earrings up it becomes
like a whole look it is a look it go
chokers from those simplest in places
you can get chokers from like forever 21
H&amp;amp;M you can get chokers anywhere because
they're so simple and it's basically
just about getting the simple ones and
layering that I hope these tips are
