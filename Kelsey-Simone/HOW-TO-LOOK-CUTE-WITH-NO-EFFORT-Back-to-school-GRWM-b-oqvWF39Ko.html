even think I can move right now if you
do then you're probably exactly like me
so basically in today's video I'm going
to be doing a little effortless tutorial
I know that in the morning for school
you don't have a lot of time to get
ready and models right now have been
rocking that really effortless no try
but somehow still look better look so I
thought I'd give you my take on that
some hair looks it really likes simple
natural but so really pretty makeup look
and some outfits that are so comfortable
but like quick to just like throw on and
then go so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video if you do give it a thumbs up
to let me know and also subscribe down
below and don't see let's get started
we're not gonna say that's good started
we're not making that so let's get
started so I'm gonna start off with hair
basically when your hair looks like crap
in the morning you know what to do with
it I have a couple of just quick little
hairstyles that I like to do that are
really easy the first one is an updo
because you gotta hide that terrible
hair I pull it in really simple button
in the middle of my head you could do it
anywhere you want but I just pull the
pieces of hair out from the bun and just
kind of make it look as messy as
possible pieces out by my ear and I pull
pieces out from the top of my forehead
and just kind of literally play around
with it and pull the hair out of the bun
until I get it looking the way I like if
it needs a little bit of pizzazz you can
totally you know fix out of it with some
cute little glasses this trick I always
pull out put my sunglasses on my head I
do that all the time
or if you guys really greasy and just
looking bad you can put a hat on this
one's from Calvin Klein it's super cute
or you can do just literally anything
that goes with your outfit I think the
hats are super cute right now I mean
it's just like trendy and it just it
looks really great and it just hides
everything that you need to hide say you
wanted your hair down and you wanted to
look a little more special that day but
your hair is still messy what I do is I
run my fingers through my hair and I
take some beach wave hair spray this one
smells like coconut milk and peaches do
you have to buy it now make sure hair
smells so good but I literally drown my
hair in this wet your soak your hair in
this and then I just run my fingers
through it and just scrunch it and
tousle it and wave it all in the hair
sometimes you could just like headbang a
little bit I do that too and then I'm
going to take this um texturizing hair
spray a
and I love the stuff it's basically like
dry shampoo helping dad some volume to
your hair and also some good scent to
help you get the look that you want to
achieve so great and now you have
effortless hair so on to the makeup
obviously starting off the clean face
I'm gonna moisturize I don't care how
fast you need to be moisturizing is key
guys this is just an oil face oil from
Dermalogica just rubbing that over and
then putting on a primer because if you
are in school you're going to need a
primer but this is a moisturizing primer
it has coconut water and it smells
amazing and this will just keep your
makeup on throughout the day so for my
foundation I'm literally not sponsored I
swear this is my favorite foundation it
is from milk cosmetics and it is called
the sunshine skin tint it's so good I
literally threw by other foundations
away it is in a rollerball so quick
quick application I just use a big brush
to blend it out it leaves a dewy finish
it has better coverage than a BB cream
but less than a full coverage foundation
because I do like to show my freckles
it's breathable on the skin it's
lightweight they have so many different
colors it smells good it's literally
perfect for my concealer I'm going to be
using the dior fix-it concealer you
could use something cheaper but I love
how quick this is it's like a lipstick
just swipe it on blend with my finger
and go this I throw in my purse because
it's so quick but it gives really really
good coverage for my eyebrows I'm going
to be using this NYX micro brow pencil I
love this one honestly better than the
honest Tasha one but basically what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
underlining just the bottom line of my
brows filling in any sparse areas to
make them just look perfectly even and
clean and just you know filled in and
thick the way I like them now I'm going
to take my Anasazi clear brow gel and
I'm going to push all my brow hairs up
that really does give that sort of
natural messy full effect of that I've
been liking to go for recently and then
totally optional you can clean them up
if you want I skip this most the time
because it takes too long but now you
got a great browse for your highlighter
I'm going to be using the Sephora
luminizing drops look at that so
basically they have a bunch of different
colors I'm just using the golden bronzy
one I forget the name of the color but
I'm just dotting it on and sweeping
across my face if you guys follow me on
snapchat you know I love my highlight
and Michael Louise skin so this stuff is
great I love the liquid because it's
just easy to blend and you got yourself
some dewy skin girl
I'm going to be using on my eyes is
mascara and I'm using the do or show you
can literally use whatever mascara you
want but I have extensions on my top
lashes so I'm just going to be putting
in them on the bottom lashes obviously
if you don't have extensions put come
home your top lashes as well so yeah
that's basically it for the eyes really
simple but cute for lips I'm gonna keep
it just simple with a nude gloss I use
glosses more than mattes lately I don't
know I just switch them up all the time
but right here I was using the Kylie
literally gloss I've been wearing that a
lot recently but like I said I change it
all the time and to set my makeup you
know me I'm gonna be using my Mario
Badescu rose water settings bright look
look how much I put on oh my gosh I love
this stuff this stuff leaves your skin
looking dewy and I just love it so now
you have a effortless and natural light
glam makeup look that I just love and
it's so cute Kelsey just stop playing
with your hair so onto the outfits I
have some simple outfits for you number
one is a t-shirt dress literally so
simple t-shirt dress and throw on some
shoes you can sell it up with a jacket a
backpack some chokers literally whatever
you want you don't even have to put on
pants you don't even have to put on
pants I worth um two different t-shirt
dresses just to show you some variations
this one's my house moving castle guys
guys and then I wore it with converse
and like I said so simple outfit number
two is sweatpants what doesn't scream
easy and quick and comfortable like
sweatpants I paired it with an oversized
t-shirt because I thought it looked
really cute literally use whatever you
want and then I also styled it with some
boomer sneakers because these are really
comfortable and really cute alpha number
three if you want to dress up a little
bit more is black skinny jeans they go
with every top literally look in your
closet every top it goes with black
skinny jeans doesn't it these are from
