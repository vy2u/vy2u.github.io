to be giving you some quick little
modeling tips and basically just telling
you how to look good in every single
picture so the first tip that I'm going
to be giving you is one get inspiration
I find that this always helps me I look
on Instagram I look through my we hard
at page I'll pretty much just go out and
look at girls facial expressions the way
that they're posing the things that
they're doing with their hands it's
really helpful to have an idea of what
you want to look like in your head so
that way when somebody's taking a
picture of you you'll know what to do
what candid poses to do what Posey poses
to do what to do with your face just get
some inspiration and just study up on
what some models or Instagram goals are
doing or even just get some candid ideas
I also like to look through magazines I
mean obviously if they're paid models
they probably got some good poses so go
ahead and look at those the second tip
that I have for you is have some go-to
faces and poses every time somebody's
taking a picture of me or group picture
with my friends I always have signature
facial expressions that I do like this
one I normally just look really really
sassy like that's just my look like I
like to just look like dang like those
eyes just fierce like look at that side
look like girl also have some funny
poses it's always really important to
just have some goofy smiley even the
candid laughs that's cool people do that
but just have some good faces look sassy
that's my thing I just like to give that
oh oh that sharp glare give them that
Elle with the hand like oh that side
look practice them in the mirror that
helps me so much I love practicing poses
and faces in the mirror lighting is key
I cannot express to you how important
this is look at this video look how bad
quality it looks and then once I turn on
literally a single ring light look how
good it looks my eyes are glowing my
glasses popping lighting is very
important I have a single ring light
like that's all that's lighting this
I'll link my ring light in the
description if you guys want it but
lighting is very essential leg tricks
and good posture if you were tall and
you don't need to do this you are
blessed
but I'm very short so what I like to do
is stand up on my tippy toes and put one
leg in front of the other if you'll
notice a lot of models do this Victoria
Secret models do this it makes your body
just look elongated and
makes you look just better also good
posture like look look at that bad
posture and then good posture like I
instantly look better taller thinner
everything get someone to take your pics
for you it's never a bad idea to just be
like hey girlie like can you take this
pic get someone who knows your angles
who's going to tell you the honest truth
and take the best pics of you which is
pretty much my mom use what you got I
always try to use things around me like
either my shirt or my hair to play with
I'll grab my shirt like this I feel like
that's really flattering I play with it
do whatever feels natural put your hands
in your pockets just use what you got to
make a pose I play with my hair all the
time that's like my go-to turn around
like give that sass give that look back
confidence is the most important every
single person including me has
insecurities but when you're taking
pictures just let that go like just feel
yourself in the moment and just know
that you look good I feel like when I'm
confident and I'm feeling myself and I
take a picture you could I don't know
what it is but you can just see it you
can just see that you're just confident
in that picture so just have fun with it
don't take it too seriously it's good to
have inspiration but don't try to be
anybody else in your pictures don't try
to look like somebody else don't try to
copy somebody else have your own style
and do your own thing and just know that
that's your thing and nobody does it
better than you and just own it there's
nothing wrong with feeling content with
yourself and feeling pretty well taking
pictures cuz you're beautiful but I
really hope these tips were helpful for
