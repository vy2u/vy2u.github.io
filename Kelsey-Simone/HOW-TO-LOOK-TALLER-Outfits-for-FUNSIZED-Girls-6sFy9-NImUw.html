seen this trend going around Twitter and
Instagram of like a picture of a girl
one she'll be like her normal height
she'll be all short and then the next
picture she'll look a bazillion times
taller and be like bet you didn't know I
was 5 2 or you'll see like the swipes of
like tips on how to pose or like the
right angles for like short girls me
being a teeny-tiny petite little mama
myself I definitely I used these tips
and I was like wow that is such a good
video idea but I didn't see anybody
talking about the clothes because the
clothes that you wear definitely do make
a difference on how you look I mean
everybody has a different body type and
they definitely make clothes for
different body types sometimes I'll see
a six-foot-tall Victoria's Secret model
and I'll want to cop her look I will put
it on and just be like oh it doesn't
look that good by the way this is a new
hairstyle for me I feel like an early
2000s cheerleader also with this shirt
oh my god oh you'll see me in the next
bring it on movie so yeah these are just
a bunch of pieces that when I'm shopping
I notice I gravitate towards more and I
like wearing them more because they look
a lot more flattering on my body the
first thing that I love wearing is when
it comes to jeans I have these black
like knee ripped Levi's jeans but ones
that are sort of I guess you could say
high water but like cropped above my
ankle I think it is the most uncute
thing when you have this much of a bunch
of Jean around your ankle I've grown up
that way I have always had this much
gene room just squished at the bottom of
my ankle because my legs were always too
short for the jeans it sort of gives the
illusion that oh my god her legs are so
bomb like they come out of the bottom of
her jeans I don't know what it is but it
just looks so much better I know like
cut jeans are really a thing so if you
have a pair of jeans that fit you really
good on top they look really nice you
can easily just cut the bottom to like
the length that you want them I do that
all the time and we're gonna talk about
the ankle a little bit I know that's
really weird like what is your ankle
have to do with anything when it comes
to sneakers are technically shoes in
generally even boots the same thing I
prefer wearing low-rise sneakers or like
really things that are corrupt under my
ankle versus on my ankle or where
they're like shin length those
definitely do not look good I used to
love like the high-top sort of vans and
I wore them all throughout the summer
not like last summer but the summer
before maybe it was last summer and I
would wear them and it just didn't look
good I'd be like why do my legs look so
study I don't like the stubby look but
my legs would always look so stubby even
if I was wearing it with shorts or like
a cropped denim skirt it just didn't
look good and now I found the low-rise
sneakers or even like the slip-on vans
look so much better it's just the way
you cut off your ankle I don't know what
it is but it makes such a big difference
but I do love a good high-top so if I am
wearing high-tops like I said I will
make sure I have those jeans that are
high watered that come right above your
ankle if you're gonna wear a long dress
don't wear something that cuts right in
between your shin or like right under
your knee get something that's either go
go big or go home get a short dress or
if you want a long dress get one that
goes all the way down to the floor and
make sure it has a slit in it if you
notice I do love wearing like long maxi
dresses but you've never seen me wear
one that doesn't have a slit in it my
best friend is the vertical striped pant
I love these these are from Urban
Outfitters I think I've run them before
like an outfit video and they have these
these three qualities that just it's
like a power copied book down it just
makes you look so good they're
high-waisted and they're super flowy but
they're vertical striped in the vertical
stripe again gives that illusion of
longer legs and it looks so flattering
so highly recommend doing this it looks
so good
even like if you wear like a body suit
like a top that has like long vertical
stripes it makes your torso look a lot
longer great if you don't like stripes
you could also do like vertical ribbed
pants I have this one picture on
Instagram that everybody was like what
the heck happened like why do you look
so tall they're high-waisted they have
the vertical striped ribs and they flow
so they just make you look like
never-ending like your body doesn't stop
going it looks so good and recently
found making you your neck in your chest
and just your torso in general looking a
lot taller longer also help
so what the fact of you looking longer
shirts with an open neckline are my holy
grail I don't mean like showing cleavage
like I don't mean like a deep plunging
neckline I mean anything that will show
your collarbones show your neck wrap
dresses or wrap tops especially the way
that they wrap and have that v-neck look
looks so insanely flattering and good on
my body type
it looks really pleasing to the eye I
like the way that it looked especially
in pictures or like if I'm shooting like
a makeup video or Beauty if I'm shooting
from here up I definitely want something
that's gonna open up my chest more so
that I don't look swallowed up also I
have this top it's from Zara and it has
this really cool like square neckline as
you can see so you see the collarbone
you see a bit of your chest it's not
like revealing or anything it just opens
up that area and makes you look great so
I have this rule when I'm getting
dressed that I always abide by it helps
me so much and I hear a lot of petite
girls saying I don't know how to wear
the whole oversized trend because I'm so
small or it just doesn't look good on
you if I'm wearing something oversized
on the top half of my body I have to
wear something more fitted and
flattering on the bottom half vice versa
if I'm wearing like big oversized baggy
mom jeans I'm gonna wear like a fitted
cropped tank top like this or like a
cropped t-shirt with like an open
neckline or say if I'm wearing a huge
oversized big hoodie I'm gonna wear like
tight fitted leather pants or like a
pair cutoff shorts you know you
definitely don't want to wear oversized
on top and oversized on bottom it just
it doesn't work for me it doesn't so I
hope that this video was helpful for you
