I don't catch those are spacious like a
power efficient OTP hey guys so for
today's video I thought I would do a
sort of like a twist on my bad booty on
a budget videos I thought instead of
talking about buying stuff today we
could make designer clothing items when
I didn't have enough money to buy
something I would just make it myself I
would rummage through my basement and my
old clothes for fabrics buttons tape
glue literally whatever I could find to
make what I wanted these DIYs are pretty
simple don't worry you don't have to be
an expert the first thing that we have
is a Saint Laurent item so what we're
going to be remaking is these Saint
Laurent YSL stockings which retail for
350 dollars with the amount of money
that I spent on the supplies to make
this I only spent $6 um and it honestly
this is gonna take like 15 maybe 20
minutes at the most to do the first
thing you're going to need obviously is
a pair of stockings you might already
actually have these in your closet so if
you do perfect but most of mine have
runs in them so I just decided to get a
new pair I picked mine up at Target they
were $4 you can get these at Walmart you
can honestly maybe even get them at the
dollar store the next thing you're going
to need is some rhinestones the ones I'm
going to be using for the stockings
already have sticky stuff on the back so
they're kind of like stickers you don't
need glue for them a hundred percent
don't recommend using glued on
rhinestones use the ones that already
have sticky stuff it's gonna make it ten
times easier ten times less messy just
just don't these are only two dollars at
the craft store so that's great it's a
hundred and fifty so I have enough even
if I mess up I actually have a picture
of like what it looks like on the
stocking I'm just going to copy that
exact what I just did was I actually put
the stocking on my foot so that way I
placed a little marker where I know
where to start so that I know where on
my ankle exactly it's going to end up
being
they ship the old tea please like I
don't ships zoom see a flower right
through see a touchdown see I really
wanna make but I gotta run run like Zoo
turnabout's wanna turn to like zoo in my
zone Wow okay that was simple that was
easy that literally took like ten
minutes it looks so good it looks like
the actual one so the next item that
we're going to be recreating is an
Alexander Wang skirt I found the skirt
on forward comm or F wrd I saw this
Alexander Wang skirt it was super cute
so it's basically a denim skirt with the
striped button-up shirt already sewn
into the bottom so I have both of my
items here I have both my denim skirt
this is from bdg I got mine from Urban
Outfitters
I just pre already had this one if you
have a denim skirt obviously you could
use that you can thrift one you can get
it on them skirt from forever 21 H&amp;amp;M
pretty much anywhere I thrift a lot of
my denim skirts but I like them the way
that they are this one's a little bit
big on me so I didn't really care about
like doing a DIY on it if you want to
copy the design exact get one that is
cut off at the bottom like this plus I
think it would just make the design look
a lot better if you do have a denim
skirt that seemed at the bottom just
take some scissors cut it off and just
distress it throw it in the wash and
then I have this blue and white striped
button-up shirt this is just one of my
own personal ones I thrifted like two
dollars super simple at first I was
going to get fabric like this and just
sew it around the base but if you look
at the actual skirt I'll put a picture
on the screen it's shaped like the
bottom of a shirt like it's sort of
rounded out which that's gonna I'm not a
sewing professional that's gonna be kind
of hard for me um it's easier just to
kind of sew a straight line so I was
like I'll just cut the base of this off
sew it on the bottom of the skirt it's
literally that simple don't worry if you
don't know how to sew I'm gonna tell you
what else you can do I'm personally
going to sew this I think it's just the
most effective way sort of we just want
it to last longer and look a little bit
more professional I would recommend
sewing if you know how to do that
if you know how to hand sew you could do
that as well but you can honestly get
like a hot glue gun or a six thousand
glue or preferably a fabric glue
do basically the same steps I'm gonna do
but instead of sewing a fabric glue it
around the base of the inside of this
skirt and the shirt you could do that as
well you could do honestly whatever you
feel it works for you whatever you have
if you have like sticky velcro double
side velcro that you can do whatever you
feel like would work back in high school
I've back in high school that makes me
sound like I'm 34 so in my senior year
of high school I actually took a fashion
class and I thought in the fashion class
you were gonna learn how to sew turns
out you had to already know how to sew
to take the class so I taught myself in
like three days how to sew so yeah so
did you get that dad joke gonna pull the
shirt all even and then I'm gonna cut it
now pretty much 90 97 percent of things
in my life I just kind of wing it so I'm
sorry if what I'm doing is like not the
correct perfect way to do it but you
know you just go with what works and
what makes sense you know when you sew
stuff you guys so it inside out so flip
your skirt inside out and we're just
gonna completely pin this thing around
the edge and then sew it on see I
touched down on the moon
see I really wanna make me but I gotta
run like Zoo
oh so this is now sort of just what it
should look like once it's done I just
have my straight seam in the back but
when you turn it inside out it's just
going to look like this it's just gonna
look like the shirts coming in from
underneath - oh God - like in my zone
 yeah I get it
you see okay and there we go that was
pretty easy it didn't even take me more
than 25 minutes to do we've got our
Alexander Wang inspired skirt I did
actually um keep two little buttons on
the front you can see them at the bottom
which of course the Alexander Wang skirt
doesn't have buttons but I mean that's
just how am I turned out the third thing
that I'm going to be creating is
probably the easiest thing this is a
blouse that I also found on the forward
website it's from JW Anderson and it was
a super pretty like white button-up
blouse dress which you've known I've
worn these before I love them but this
one had these sort of like long black
like wraps around the wrist I thought it
was a cool detail for the price of the
blouse I was like that's something I
could very easily do on my own I picked
up a white button-up dress on the craft
store I picked up just plain black
fabric I got something that had like a
little bit of stretch in it and
something that looks like it would just
flow nicely I just tried to get
something as close to her fabric as
possible so that when it hung down off
your wrist it would flow better than
something more stiff you know so this
was like $5 for the yard of fabric I'm
gonna cut this I'm gonna keep it pretty
thick because hers weren't like super
thin strips like they were actually
pretty thick I don't really use like
exact measurements so I'm sorry if you
really like using exact measurements I
measure nothing you see I know I did
those songs into my child well you keep
uh okay so basically what I did was I
just cut strips of the fabric it's a
little like it's a little very uneven
it's very uneven but at least we have
long strips I don't even really need to
show you what I did because it's so
simple um so I took the shirt you don't
really need to do anything to your
button-up shirt and basically just tie
it in a bow around the sleeves that's
all it honestly really is you keep
moving me I'm going take a fly out like
spaceship I don't catch those on
spaceships like a power to the vision
won't you feel like a dawn okay
DIYs that I have for today I hope you
guys enjoyed this if you want to see
more like designer remake DIYs make sure
to give this video a thumbs up to let me
know maybe I can do like a little series
on this really quickly I did want to
notify you guys though and normally this
would be the time in the video but I
would be like I post two videos a week
Tuesday and Fridays but I'm actually
going back to just doing Friday's now I
know it's kind of a bummer but being the
perfectionist that I am I put so much
time and energy into my videos that I
felt like doing two videos a week was
just not working out for me so I'm going
back to just doing Friday's but anyways
I do hope that you guys enjoyed this
video so yeah I love you guys so much
