doing a makeup tutorial for you guys
this is just a really simple glam prom
makeup look I used a golden color
because I have a new dress but you can
easily like just swap it out for
whatever color your dresses so I started
off with a fresh face and I moisturize
because I have dry skin and this makes
my foundation look flawless this is the
belief from philosophy just Aquabot
moisturizer literally the best
moisturizer ever loved this stuff then
I'm going to be taking my Mario Badescu
rose water sprite and spraying this all
over I've talked about this in a
favorites video before using mine eggs
born to glow illuminating primer I'm
just going to be putting this all over
my face guys like no joke this is my
favorite primer ever I use this all the
time now and it's just seriously an
amazing primer I kind of focus it on the
parts of my face that I would highlight
just my cheekbones forehead nose chin
all those areas and then starting with
the eyes I'm going to do this before my
face because it makes things easier just
priming with my shadow insurance and
then I also just concealed a little bit
so I sprayed my eye shadow brush to make
the eye shadow come out a little bit
more intense I'm using this half-baked
Urban Decay golden eye shadow I think
this is a really pretty eye shadow for
the look I was going for you can use
literally whatever color your dress is
mine was just nude so I thought that the
gold would be really pretty and I just
placed this all over my lids using my
Kat Von D shade and light palette I'm
just going to take a fluffy brush and
just take any matte brown eyeshadow you
have and I just put this inside my
crease then I took an even darker matte
Brown and put that in the center of my
crease and blended that out to make it
just looks sort of ombre next moving on
to foundation I'm using my Dior skin
nude BB cream if you want to use full
coverage go ahead I just decided to use
a BB cream because I just wanted just a
lighter foundation on my skin and I
didn't want to look cakey that night so
I just went with this and also has a
really dewy finish which I like just
personally and I'm blending that with a
flat top brush pretty sure this is from
BH Cosmetics just getting that all over
my face then for concealer I'm using the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I'm
putting this underneath my eyes and also
using that concealer to just clean up
the eyeshadow look that
did and then blending that out with a
really fluffy brush then I'm going to be
taking a translucent powder this is just
an elf pressed powder that's translucent
putting that on top of all the concealer
I just did next I'm taking the same
brown eyeshadow and putting that
underneath on my lash line and blending
that out then I'm taking my mac
mineralize skinfinish bronzer just
bronzing up my face just to give me a
sort of tanned look because I did self
tan I just put that in the same places
that you would contour getting that in
your cheekbones and on top of the
forehead I put some down my neck and on
my chest as well and I just think that
this gives a really good glow then to
contour I just did this really lightly
with my Mac contouring powders I didn't
really do anything heavy again with the
contour but with the highlight I have
pretty heavy so this is my Pat McGrath
I'm just highlighting stick and this is
in the color nude and I'm just putting
this in all the typical highlight places
on my cheekbones forehead nose Cupid's
bow and chin and then I'm blending that
out and then also on top of that I
decided to put from my Anasazi glow kit
the mimosa highlighter which is the best
highlighter literally ever I just took a
fan brush and put this all around my
face just sort of doing like a seed
around my eye I've been really liking
that shape like look at that glow
blending everybody at your prom like yes
look at that
oh my gosh okay Wow so then I'm moving
on to my eyebrows and I just basically
took my NYX eyebrow pencil and I'm
drawing a little line underneath just to
define it
for my brows I kind of like them to look
more defined on the bottom but then sort
of like I'm messy on the top so I'm just
like pushing my hairs up I do that with
this brow gel from NYX this is an
amazing brow gel it just keeps them in
place all night and it's tinted so it
also just adds a little bit of darkness
as well and then cleaning that up with
concealer to give it a highlighted
browbone effect I used a slightly
lighter concealer than I just have on my
face next for mascara I'm using my
voluminous from L'Oreal mascara and
coating my bottom lashes and then I'm
just doing like a slight layer on my top
lashes because I did add fake lashes but
again like that's optional or whatever I
don't remember the specific lashes I
used I'm pretty sure they're just the
Iredell natural whispies and I didn't
get that on camera because it's really
hard to do out on camera but
just some lash glue let that get tacky
and then put them on I put some brown
eyeliner on the bottom and smudged that
out and then I also took the same gold
eyeshadow and put that on the top of my
cheekbones mix that in with my highlight
to just sort of make it like match and I
thought it looked really really pretty
like look at that Cupid's bow look at it
I just thought it looked really good and
then moving on to the last step which is
lips I used a NYX lip liner in the color
nude pretty simple and just line my lips
just to define them and get that perfect
you know pouty shape then I use my two
favorite colors this is peanut brittle
and this is honeymoon both from NYX
one's a butter gloss and one's a
lingerie and I mix them together peanut
brittle the best colors seriously my
favorite color but for the look I wanted
it a little bit darker so I mixed it
with the honeymoon from the NYX lingerie
collection and they just made it the
perfect perfect color and I put the
peanut brittle on top instead of on
bottom because I wanted it to be glossy
not matte just to go with that really
glowy look for prom
I love the glowy look and the gloss goes
with it it's kind of like you
highlighted your lips but not really to
make sure my makeup stayed on all night
I use the Urban Decay setting spray
which is amazing it just sort of locks
in your makeup on your face and yeah
this is the finished look just a golden
a really glowy bronzy makeup look I hope
