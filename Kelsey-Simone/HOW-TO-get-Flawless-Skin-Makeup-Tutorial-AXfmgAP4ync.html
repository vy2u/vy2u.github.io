going to be doing a makeup tutorial well
it's almost like skincare and makeup
it's like a before makeup skincare and a
makeup look for this tutorial I'm going
to be focusing mainly on the skin I'm
doing like a fresh face sort of summer
flawless skin look I know in the summer
everybody's trying to have the most
beautiful glowing radiant skin so I
thought that I would show you my little
tutorial on how I do that sidenote my
face is slightly lighter than my body
because of fake tan but I'm going to
start off with clean skin and I'm going
to do a sheet mask I obviously don't do
this every day before I start my makeup
but say about once maybe twice a week
because I don't use like super intense
sheet masks you can do this just to make
sure your skin is looking prime time
before you put your makeup on I have
extremely dry skin so it's very
important for me to moisturize before
makeup at the least of just putting
moisturizer on but you can do a sheet
mask for whatever sort of skin type you
have I just let that set on my face for
like five minutes
and make sure to rub all the serum into
your skin that let your skin absorb it
and get all those good products right
into your skin before you do your makeup
this sort of like indie crusts my skin
almost I know it's gross the sheet masks
that I just used and pretty much all of
mine come from face to recom I'll link
them below as well as everything else
that I use but my under eyes are the
most dry part my under eyes just always
a Creasy and cracking and just dry and
gross so I put these little eye patches
on just for like maybe like a minute
just to add some extra hydration under
that area to ensure that my makeup is
going to look flawless so then I'm going
to go in with moisturizer just to sort
of seal it all and to sort of protect my
skin from the makeup I'm about to put on
it here I was using a Tom Ford
moisturizer I know this is like a little
booze and extra you don't have to use
the one that I was using I was just
testing this one out actually I'll link
below a couple of moisturizers that I
like but you could use anything that you
already have and that you personally
love and look how glowing my skin is
before we've even put any makeup on so
of course before my makeup I'm going to
prime my face I'm just using this Marc
Jacobs coconut primer and rubbing that
all over for foundation I'm using my
all-time save our Mercier you guys know
I'm obsessed with her foundations and
just face makeup and everything it's so
amazing here I decided to go with the
tinted moisturizer just because I wanted
something super light and she
to show my freckles show my skin let it
breathe a little bit I'm going to be
blending that in with a flat top brush
this is let me tell you amazing this
one's actually from ELF it's like five
or six dollars but it is the best brush
I've ever used to apply foundation in my
life like I will never use a beauty
blender never foundation brush ever
again this just gives your skin such an
airbrushed look you can see that the
tinted moisturizer didn't cover my
freckles which I love it's not too thick
it basically just evens out my skin tone
and makes my face match my neck and just
adds a little bit of do for my under
eyes I'm also using alarm or CA
concealer I feel like using a concealer
that's the same brand as the foundation
is really important because it'll ensure
that you know all the ingredients are
going to work well together and that
there's not going to be any problem
because sometimes that does happen to me
so plus I just love our concealer so I'm
using this really fluffy under eye
concealer blending brush from Sephora
that's amazing I'm just going to sort of
pop that in let it warm up on my skin
and I also like to bring that on top of
my eyelids because I have really veiny
eyelids so just sort of covering that
then for powder let me tell you this
powder is the only powder I own I've
talked about this before I just I know
it's a little bit expensive but this
powder will change your life forever
this is the YSL I think it's called like
the highlighting pressed powder it
basically will set your makeup without
making it look matte like it has a
little tiny highlighting particles that
keeps your skin looking dewy but while
letting it dry as well I don't know how
that works but it's amazing so I only
set my under eyes that you could set
your whole face if you have oily skin
then I'm going to take my concealer and
make a little line under where I contour
this is just basically helps me to clean
it up later I'm going to take a huge
fluffy face and body brush from Marc
Jacobs and I'm going to take my Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and just
sort of bronze up my whole face and the
areas you would contour just the hollows
of my cheeks underneath my chin I take
that down my chest a little bit in on my
forehead as you temples as well and then
I'm going to go in with a more tapered
contouring brush this one's from Sephora
I'm obsessed with this brush it's
amazing and just sort of more define
that runs that we did I also like to
take this underneath my lip this sort of
gives the illusion that your bottom lip
is a little bit bigger it's a great
little trick but yeah basically just
warm
my face a little bit giving it a little
bronzed glow before my highlight I have
two different highlights I'm going to
use the first is this Laura Geller
highlighter in the colored gilded honey
it's this beautiful gold pressed powder
highlight the second highlighter that I
have is the dewy stick from I'm not even
an attempt because I know I'm going to
butcher the name but I'll put it on the
screen it is this like stick sort of wet
highlighter it doesn't have any glitter
or any sort of like actual highlighter
in it it's just this wet dewy stick
almost kind of like face gloss face
gloss is literally just clear lip gloss
that you put on your face for shine but
it pretty much feels like maple syrup on
your face but this gives that look of
that really pretty Sheen without that
gross feel so I just put that on my
cheekbones and my shoulders
taking the pressed powder highlight I'm
putting that on the tip of my nose the
bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and
then taking this Pat McGrath
highlighting brush I'm going to wet it a
little bit so it picks up more product
and I'm just gonna blend that along the
top of my forehead and the top of my
chin I also think that I put this on my
collarbones and I just love a super like
glowy shoulder collarbone combo when you
wear in off the shoulder top it looks
really pretty but now that's it for the
face so I'm just setting that with a
setting spray this is the Marc Jacobs
coconut one for my brows I'm keeping it
super simple and natural I've been doing
pretty much nothing to my brows lately
except for brow gel so that's what I'm
doing here this is the Anasazi clear
brow gel and then I just put a little
bit of tinted brow gel where they tend
to be a little bit sparse but yeah
that's it super simple super natural for
the eyes I took the dewy stick and put
that all over my lids just to give that
again I gloss look without actually
using base gloss and it feels amazing it
doesn't crease and get nasty next I'm
using this color pop eyeshadow palette
and I'm taking this rusty red shadow and
putting that with a pencil brush on my
bottom lash line it looks kind of stupid
now but once I put on my mascara it just
sort of you'll see what it does but I'm
using my roller lash and putting one to
two coats on my top and bottom lashes
basically the shadow just adds a little
bit of depth and dimension to my eyes
without actually doing like a whole
bunch of eye makeup or liner whatever
just keeping it super natural but it
also just sort of brings out the golden
nough sin my eyes so yeah that's what
the eye makeup looks like again super
simple and very natural for my lips I'm
using my favorite all-time save
colourpop lip gloss
this is in the shade WeHo well we yeah
anyways it just was a really pretty nude
lip gloss and then topping that off with
more setting spray so that is the whole
look look at this flawless skin oh look
at that glow look at that shine the eye
gloss I'm obsessed with this I'm going
to start using it all the time but I
really hope you guys enjoyed this look
