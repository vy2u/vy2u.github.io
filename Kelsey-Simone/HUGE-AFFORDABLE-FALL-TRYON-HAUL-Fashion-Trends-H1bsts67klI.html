today what today's video is is it's
gonna kind of be like a mix of two
different video tapes together I'm going
to be doing a very large link I have so
much stuff a huge fashion try on haul
but also it's gonna be kind of like a
trend alert video because everything
that I bought sort of this like a really
big fall trend at the moment or just
something that I would have talked about
in a trend alert video anyways also this
is going to be like a very affordable
clothing haul if you watched my hauls
before on this channel you've probably
heard of a website called zaple I worked
with them so many times and they keep
asking me to work with them and I keep
saying yes because they keep hugging me
up with the best stuff I have some of my
cutest clothes in my wardrobe it's from
when I collab with them and you guys
always see Millie when I collab with
them because their stuff is very
affordable but it's also pretty good
quality it's all online of course I'll
leave all the links for their websites
as well as of course everything that I
talked about will be listed down there
so let's get started let's talk about my
fun sweater because it's the first thing
that I have to talk about is this
sweater you know you monochromatic mama
bought it in black and in white girl
embellishments was definitely something
that's at the top of my like current
fall trends there have been tons of
high-end designers that have been
covering their stuff in real
embellishments I might have even talked
about that in my last trend Miller I've
been seeing pools everywhere and also
these flared cuffs are really cool I do
have another sweater to show you that
has these sort of like flared cuffs that
I think are just they add so much
interest to a sweater and then it has
this v-neck example Suzi is the best
prices I'm gonna put I don't know where
I'll put it but I'll put all the prices
for everything that I talked about on
the screen this next piece I am so
completely obsessed and in love with I
know I say that a lot but it's so you
guys know I love trench coats I've
talked about it so many times and I
honestly wear things like this a lot and
I love love love love the mixture of fur
and done them together I think that
superhot for fall and winter okay the
next piece that I have look at these bad
boys these pants are so nice you guys
know I love a pair of good quality jeans
good quality jeans are another thing
that you typically look for man going
fall shopping these have a little bit of
flair and a little bit of fringe at the
end they're not like bell-bottoms though
they're not like 70s like flare flare
they're just not skinny jeans I do
recommend going a size up in these pants
they have a zipper in the back and then
they lace up in the front which I've
been seeing lace-up jeans everywhere I
almost forgot I mentioned this earlier
the sweater with the big sleeves it's
honestly so cute it's just this thick
knit black it has like a v-neck sweater
and it's very just like flowy and long
with these huge sleeves I'm all them
poncho sleeves I don't really know why
because nothing of this reminds me of a
poncho just adding like a really nice
layer of fun to your wrists you know I
did talk about this in my last trend
alert which was matching sets I got this
matching sweat pants and sweatshirts set
in his all velvet it is these just fell
of it literally ever has these three
little stripes on the side giving you a
little adidas vibes this set is only $32
and that is including both thing I hate
when websites do that when they give you
a matching set and they make you buy the
top and the pants separately these next
two items I kind of bought to go
together you've already seen me wear
this so it's like this super deep v-neck
I sort of wear off the shoulder because
the neckline is so large it's like this
distressed knit white chunky sweater I
think is really cool for layering now
the trend that I've been loving is
styling like your floppy sweaters over a
really pretty dress so I picked up this
dress too initially just wear with this
sweater it's this sort of like body con
fitting white lacy it looks like a slip
dress but it's actually like knitted
cotton I've been very into like a
vintage you looking pieces
lately it's very vintage Dior to me
doors one of my favorite designers and I
just really liked that outline of it I
know tons of people have been doing that
like that outline sort of structured bra
looking top I think it's really cool I
like the vintage buttons on I know those
pieces that you're just thinking like I
need to just get out of my comfort zone
so this skirt I would have never bought
I barely wear skirts you guys know that
so I would have never bought this and
humppa Julianne ears but I got it it
looks so good on me
so it's this it's super tight around the
waistline it's got stripes and buttons
and it goes all the way down to your
ankles
and it has like a little slit in the
front you can't really see cuz of the
design but it slits in the front up to
the buttons so it's like a pretty modest
skirt which I'm all about looking modest
and super cute at the same time this
dress something that reminds me this
dress it's this super long like it
covers your shoes like down to the floor
dress it had at first a deeper neckline
and the mom that I am I sewed it up a
little bit because it was a little too
much for me but it has these little like
short sleeves they're kind of like
see-through almost it's really cool it's
like this sheer mesh but it does have
like a black mesh underneath so it's not
see through it all and as this white
star pattern on it that I really really
like and I think it just fits me so good
I love the way it fits on my body I got
one kind of like it this one is a little
see-through though as you can tell so
you do have to wear something underneath
of it I would probably just wear like a
white short slip dress underneath but
it's a wrap dress you have the strings
you have the whole insides you can like
wrap it around your body it's got these
frills around like the neckline and I
think it's really cool you know
sometimes when you want to put an effort
like you want to look really cute but
you just want to be so comfortable at
the same time look at this it's a
t-shirt dress like literally just like a
comfy white t-shirt dress but it's like
half pin straight material and they even
look offset at the bottom and then it
comes with a matching belt to tie and
cinch around your waist this is the
coolest thing
like I'm so glad this is a thing can
more people make dressy t-shirt dresses
then we have this one it's like this off
the shoulder it's bigger than the it's
like two times the width of my head I
think these leaves are so cool I don't
know about you guys but it's got that
like sort of ruched top that I really
like like look how stretchy that is man
and it's very it's just a really good
looking dress so the next thing I have
it's two pieces that come together which
again thank you sappal I hate when you
buy like a clothing item that's like two
pieces that are meant to be worn
together and they're sewn together
saffle does not sew their stuff together
thank you
this dress was advertised to wear with a
white t-shirt underneath the dress
sometimes you may just want to wear it
as a dress or wear it was like a
long-sleeve shirt underneath you know
like get multiple options so yeah you
get two nice pieces for one you get this
really pretty dress that I'm gonna talk
about as well as a very soft white
t-shirt to go underneath this dress is
something again I typically wouldn't buy
for myself cause look at the skirt like
it's so like
it's so like flowy and thing it's like
very baby doll very like big and flowy
it looks really pretty on this is Deb I
know this is not fall it is a bathing
suit but I didn't really just want this
bathing suit Zappa recommended this to
me
you know I'm there's a little like
recommended items we might think you
like and I definitely I I liked it so I
did decide to get a because I very much
wanted it but this print was something I
wanted to talk about anyways because
I've been finding so many cute things
with this print on it and I have a
couple of pieces like this and I've been
loving it I know these are like a little
bit cheeky for like me personally top
part just sort of ties in a little knot
which i think is really adorable I
almost forgot but I did not add one more
sweater to show you it looks like it's
been destroyed I love that like
distressed look the bottom is very
uneven I've never seen a sweater like
this where the front is cropped and not
the back I think that's really cool and
again I do like the thick stripes I
bought a couple sweaters like this from
Zach Hill before guys we're almost done
I swear this is three
tops and one I put them all in the same
hangar but the next trend I wanted to
talk about was wrap up or like lace up
or like just shirts with strings that
you just tie around now this is a weird
kind of t-shirt I don't have anything
with sleeves like this like do you see
how short these t-shirts leaves are
hates this ribbed white shirt and it
just sort of has these long strings you
tie them sort of like around the front
like a wrap top you'll see it in the
trial but it sort of just wraps around
your torso and it just adds a really
nice detail so it's like a halter top it
just goes around your neck like this
again it's just like white and ribbed I
love ribbed stuff sort of has like no
back to the shirt except this on the
bottom of your back just ties in a
little bow and then this top you've seen
me wear this in a video recently it's
just this like sort of like ruched flowy
tank top with these bows that wrap
around the sleeves this comes in
multiple colors but again I just only
got it in black fits super stretchy this
will fit a lot of different sizes last -
clothing items that I have and then I
just have a couple accessories this
dress I've been wanting something like
this and I never knew where to get one
I've always wanted something like either
a tank top or a dress with like chain
straps like I thought how cool would
that be to have this gray ribbed long
bodycon dress has gold chain straps how
cool is that I think that one would look
so pretty with tons of gold jewelry like
gold hoops and like some gold layered
necklaces and then also is one of those
things that I looked at it and I was
like what
Add to Cart um so it's this halter top
that's like this super stretchy material
and then it has like fur lining around
the bottom is that not just like
interesting I personally would style
this like a little bit more basic just
to like play it down a little bit of
course it is fake fur now to finish off
the haul we have some accessories these
particular glasses have been waited on
for so long I mean wearing these like
crazy you guys have just been asking
where I'm getting them
I feel so bad I didn't want to stay
until the actual haul so I'm sorry for
not telling you I have them all three
concerts because I thought they were
that cool I think there were only like
eight or nine dollars which is such a
good price
especially for glasses like this cool
they look like sunglasses that have been
like straight cut in half which i think
is sick
another trend that I have that
definitely didn't start in the summer
but I feel like is going to sort of like
keep going in the fall is straw this bag
I needed to get because I've been
wanting a straw bag and especially
because it has a black bow on it I
thought that was so cute and then I also
got this straw pocket hat which is kind
of like a really cool I don't know I saw
it and my mom was like and I was like
yeah and then I did have to pick up
these cuz I saw them on the site and I
thought they were really cute they're a
pair of he's like black little kitten
heels I think Kim heels are super trendy
they're definitely very on-trend Dior
just came out with a whole bunch of
kitten heels and they're so cute I also
picked up these so like these long
rhinestone earrings but they're super
pretty they catch a lot of light I know
the Lighting's kind of weird in here you
probably can't really see them glitter
but they definitely do ends Apple
bringing something new to the plate got
foam cases Zappos never had phone cases
before and when they wrote me they were
like oh hey girl by the way we have a
whole new line of phone cases do you
want some and I was like hey yeah so
they sent me some phone cases I got a
couple I'll show you but I have them my
phone this one currently but it has some
like tropical leaves on it which is
super cool I know it has nothing to do
with fall but I love tropical leaves I
also got a marble one they just had like
a classic marble which I always just
have a good classic marble it just looks
very pretty various and then I got this
pink like quartz marble one which is
really cool it has like mixes of gold in
there which I really like this one I'm
actually probably gonna let my mom have
though because she's been loving pink
lately and then I also got myself this
white floral one with the leaves again I
just very much like the little leafy
thing going on it has these like very
tropical looking white flowers on it and
I love the clear flexible cases I really
like these
I will definitely leave a link below for
Zappos phone cases they were only five
dollars each which is really good for
iPhone cases okay guys that seems to be
it I know you
relieved that was a really long haul but
again thank you does Apple for sending
all this stuff all the lease for
everything will be in the discription
