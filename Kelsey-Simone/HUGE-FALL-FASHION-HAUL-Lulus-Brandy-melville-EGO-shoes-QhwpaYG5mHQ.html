to appreciate this looks so Halloween
look so that I'm so proud of the skull
and pumpkins we got the black fur I just
I think it looks so good okay I'm sorry
this video is not Halloween themed
chances are like a week into October so
I'll just make the intro music Halloween
they did the Monster Mash I blew a lot
of money wasted a lot of money but I
really like the things that I wasted the
money on so I'm going to show them to
you that was me like try not to say the
word haul but I'm doing a haul super
like fall themes like everything is like
boots and jackets and jeans but it's
also a try on haul so you can see how
BOM all the stuff looks so the first
thing I'm going to show you is
everything I got from Lulu's calm Thank
You Toulouse for gifting you all that
cool stuff you just look at these these
are so cool easier showstopper I like
out there things that I know nobody else
is going to have then like you know oh
gee these are so oh gee these are so
cute they're like velvety but it's like
crushed velvet so it's like the two
different shades of velvet and on their
super hikes I'm like literally a midget
so they going all the way up my thigh it
gives them like again like another like
flare that makes them look different but
these are hot and I love them I was like
scrolling down Lulu's I saw these I
clicked then we've got some sweaters
because what doesn't scream fall more
than sweaters I'm not really like a
sweater person I got this one sweater
which I actually am really obsessed with
it's so cute it's just this like
turtleneck umm what is this called
sweater material I'm really stupid guys
just just deal with that throughout this
video please thinks so obviously since
it's cold you know you don't want to
feel like a draft so it's nice that it's
like longer and then it's yeah it's just
I'm trying to like explain it but it's
just literally a great turtleneck
there's nothing much to it but I just
really like the cut of it like the way
it fits on me I really like it and then
also this one has a cool cut - this one
is just white but then the back of it is
like really
lo so these are like for those like
cooler fall days that you know you're
not going to freeze to death in this
oversized you know plain white sweater
it's actually kind of like cream color
but I really like it this sweater is so
cute if you know black top and then the
back so this was so cute I had to get
this it like laces all the way up the
back and I like how like big the little
like eyelet thingies are and then it's
just kind of like open at the bottom
it's actually like a really like
form-fitting and it's ribbed which I
love ribbed stuff then I got a sweater
dress long sleeve like sweater II
material longer dress and can tie in the
back so it's like fitted around the
waist and then there's like a little
like knot and I love wearing like
dresses oh and it has a slit girl I
didn't even know it had a slit that's so
cute
in my style like I love mixing like
fancier nicer pieces with like dress
down Street stuff by the way I don't
think you're gonna get to see like any
color in this haul so if you're that
girl
this ain't your haul I got this Barbour
jacket that is like this like stitched
Society in the back which is really cute
I love it Lulu's has so many bomb
armored up Luth is so many bomb Bulmer
chariots they have a lot of cute bomber
jackets so if you're looking for a
bomber jacket highly recommend anyway so
this one's really soft it's not like
your typical bomber jacket material it
almost feels silky in a way it's really
nice they have a lot of black bomber
jackets so this one's I get a little
different so then I got a couple pairs
of pants in the first pair of pants I've
got were these like suede legging do
please don't make any jab jokes in the
comments which I thought were really
cool and I really wanted to get them
because I always have problems really
with outfits like this like I'm wearing
leggings but then like I don't want to
wear black leggings I want to look nicer
so I thought sway leggings would do the
trick like they're still black leggings
but they're like nicer because they're
suede and I love me some black pants so
yeah these are really nice they just
have like the zipper in the back and
they're stretchy and really soft like I
can't wait to wear these because I feel
like they're gonna be really comfortable
and then I got some jeans Jean shopping
is so so hard for me online I need to
try my jeans but for some reason
loulou's knows me like every single pair
of jeans I've ever bought from Lulu's
and they all fit me perfectly so that's
really good so I got these ones and if
these were so nice like the quality of
them just looks so good they're just
plain blue jeans and I feel like I
wanted these all of my jeans have like
rips or they're like mom jeans or
there's like something going on so I
feel like you know I just wanted like a
plain pair and they're really high
waisted and this is so extra of me but I
love it just to your typical bodycon
dress but it's like covered in bedazzles
and it's just like a short body contrast
not too short and it's just like open in
the back so it gives like a really nice
you know accent piece I love with my
clothes match my personality and you
know this is just what I'm feeling extra
you know probably definitely might like
my next like New Year's dress or like
maybe even Christmas dinner dress is
this too extra for Christmas Eve putting
on two extra for Christmas Eve if you
know what I'm saying okay I'm so excited
about these I know girl I'm gonna be
wearing these like every day I would
wear this with this actually this whole
montage I got going on on top like I
would read these on the bottom so
basically they're silk dress pants and
they're like they flare at the bottom
like they're really thick pant legs but
buh-bam they slit all the way up this
side it's kind of hard to explain you'll
see it in the Tryon but like they're
really cool I am obsessed with them you
will definitely be seeing some like
either like look books or after the days
some on Instagram you will see me
wearing these because I'm obsessed with
these I think they're so cute I love
them and I just can't express how cool I
think these are oh one other sweater
there's another sweater so this is just
like this is something like I've never
seen anything like this before it's just
like a plain black turtleneck what you
think it is and then it like get so long
and it just like slips at the bottom
like I've never seen like slits in
shirts I mean like I have but not like
this so it's really cool it's just like
you know given a little more like move
and pizzazz to your basic like
turtleneck which i think is really cute
because I were like turtlenecks like
just sweaters a lot during the fall then
I got this t-shirt from Lulu's so it is
just basically your
black t-shirt but it's really distressed
it has a bunch of like holes and rips in
it which I love to stress t-shirts you
guys know that I have the same exact
shirt in white but I wanted it in black
just so I could have both like the
options then the last thing that I got
from Lulu's were a pair of sunglasses
these are Spitfire sunglasses and they
are so cute these are like just sort of
those like everyday glasses I'll
probably throw this in my bag you're
probably thinking like you'll see you
like it's fall but like the Sun still
shines in fall okay they have these like
a little like metal grommet ething ease
I don't even know what a grommet is just
kind of said that um but they're black
they have these little like metal
sidings I don't know if you can like you
can see that and I love them so dorbz
hmm no we're not saying that word this
little this little number I got on right
here loose love their jewelry so I'm a
10-person I love wearing chokers but
when it comes to chokers I like really
delicate ones because I like layering a
ton of them so this one was so perfect
and I wear it like honestly every day
it's like this plain like black just
string with this little like beautiful
rhinestone on it that I love so much and
then I have this little bracelet again
really delicate but good to layer other
bracelets with and it's just like this
little like knot and it's gold and I
have a lot of just like gold bracelets I
like layering so definitely a good one
to add to the collection oh that is
everything I got from luscom definitely
love them thanks Lulu's by the way for
gifting me with all this stuff I picked
out all this Bond stuff on their website
yes definitely love that stuff you'll be
seeing me wearing it a lot so moving on
to other stuff I have a couple shoes
they're from ego and these are just
black like knee-high they know a little
bit above the knee actually then they
little lace all the way up the back
which i think is so cute definitely said
adding something a little bit extra I
got these like crushed velvet shoes I
love them I love these like style heels
just like the simple to strap and then
also I got some slides just because I
really like slides and I got the grey
ones because I like a grey
and I just love slides they're just so
easy like non complicated and
comfortable snapshots on this first go
follow me on snapchat but I drop this
bag from the Zac Posen they gifted this
to me thank you so much it's so so cute
so it's in this like little like
rectangle shape which I don't have like
any purses like this you just open it
there's a bunch of strap that it comes
with it cut it literally comes with like
three or four straps I think so you can
change like either the one that you want
or the length that you want so I added
this is from Zac Posen as well this one
doesn't come with the bag this is
separate I like my purses really long so
this chain wasn't enough for me like a
want I wanted it to be longer so I like
double connected both of them so it's
like half fur and like half chain which
I actually kind of dig it's so cool I
got something from brandy he got this
from brandy when I was in New York for
beauty con and I got this white fur
bomber jacket I'm so obsessed with this
literally so obsessed with this there
weren't even any in the store I saw it
like all the way on the top shelf in the
back of the store on mannequin and I had
the guard go get a ladder to go get it
down for me because I'm that extra and I
