doing a haul for you I just really could
stuff that and I'll show you an online
store it named princess Polly sent to me
I love sharing people I have a couple
things that are little seasonal too
right now but a lot of this stuff is a
little bit more like summery all this
stuff is really cute I'll have the links
below for concise outside their
Instagram and all the stuff that I have
here cuz they're really cute and I know
you're probably gonna want to buy them
actually I have a discount code for you
I'll put it somewhere on the screen
editing Kelsie go do that we get if you
want 10% off whatever you're going to
buy use my code
it's just Kelsey and all cats so since
I've gotten these I've already wear
these jeans what like 10 times they just
look like typical blue mom jeans or
highways that they fit really really
nice on the back of this eye and has
like a little slit here do usually have
like 50 million pairs of blue jeans but
these are my favorite and then ooh this
is really cute so this is like it's
supposed to look like a button-up shirt
but it's like long enough is a dress oh
it's just white with these like little
grace and strikes and it's short sleeve
which is really nice so I can also wear
this and like the spring and stuff like
that and I'm not going to be you know so
I love like t-shirt dresses and just
wearing oversized sweatshirts and like
button-up shirts everything is dresses
so yeah and it doesn't pocket ooh you
know Modelo's pockets I've been obsessed
with my button-up shirts lately like
strikes on the purses that weird I like
wearing them like really big like
dresses like this or I'll like pull them
off the shoulders bottom emag are like I
don't know then I got I actually got two
of these I got this one in black this is
just like a little tank top wrap shop I
think wrap tops are so adorable I know
much of long-sleeve Wrap tops but I
don't have any tank top one so I thought
that this would be really good for the
summer if you just don't over your
bathing suit like they're really simple
and they'll go with everything drab tops
normally have really deep neckline so
they're really cute wears like tons of
chokers layered up and then I also got
the same one in white this one is a
little bit different just have these
like gold stripes on it which from
online you couldn't tell but I really
really like it it's really pretty it's
like the material of just like a really
thin blouse so they're really breathable
and comfortable this dress a whole lot
Wow I'm obsessed with these like v-neck
really long dresses with a slit in the
side so I have like a couple of dresses
with this
style but none of them fit me as good as
this dress does like I this is my
favorite dress that I own like when I
tried this on liked it I shed a tear it
was it's so pretty and it's silk so it's
super soft and I love so I have so many
sew dresses and so many soaked tops
right now also something I love about
this dress is it has a slit on the right
side normally all of my dresses are
split on the left side I don't know why
but my good side is the right side so I
can I turn on my good side take pictures
you know what I'm saying yeah and then
like this color this champagne a nude
color oh my god to die for I'm obsessed
with this colors it's just like really
Mavi I really like this so I also have
this listen really cute I don't have any
robbers but this is like an
off-the-shoulder romper and then it has
these two like tassels that you like
tying bows on your shoulder which is the
most cutest classy chic thing ever start
to dog hair on it my dog is everywhere
I feel like robbers are like a light
pack when you don't know what to wear
you just put this on because it's
literally like one outfit this is just
one of those simple things you throw on
but like you look so effortless and cute
at the same time and then ooh
so this dress um this dress that's all I
can say I'm speechless so perfect I
don't know if you can see that Wow -
this dress is just like a black body
card dress that laces up all the way
down the middle and it's really like you
know anything okay black and gold
classic combo and I think it's really
pretty lace up it's all over every
single dress on top right now and I like
the idea that it laces all the way down
normally you will nice isn't it like
laces down the front but lacing all the
way down vertical and you're not you
know naked through here so there is
actually like a black piece of fabric
underneath all of this lacing because I
was like aren't you going to be able to
see through all that like that would be
awkward but yeah there's like a black
piece under here so then I got this
because I was very intrigued I don't
have any scores it's basically the skirt
but they're like shorts which is like
such cool concept to me it's like it
shorts at the same time I love denim and
it fits really well it's just like the
stress at the bottom I'm obsessed with
this again I'll probably do feels like a
lot so for spring and summer honestly
this would be really cute with like
outfit like you know yeah yeah that's a
look and then I picked out this like
black Wrangler t-shirt because I didn't
it's cute and most of my black t-shirts
are like really big and oversized
because I like wearing them like that
this one I actually got in a small so
it's super fitted and it's just you know
really cute and then it just says
Wrangler on it so it's not just like
basic block either super cute again very
basically you can style it like however
you want with like chokers jackets then
I got these jeans which I've also worn
500 times already I never wear jeans
that like aren't I way since these are
low res and they just look so good on
they're just super ripped and really
distressed which I like they just look
really good on and I love all the rips
and holes in them they're just like
super super grungy then I have a bathing
suit I really live intrigued by like the
style of these bottoms because I don't
have any like this I'm not going to try
this one out of they're actually like
high-waisted which I really skeptical
about but it actually looks kind of good
on and they're like this creamy pink
nude color and then the top just sort of
looks like a sports bra almost which I
think that's really cool I like just
like the sports bra top it's like and
literally just looks like you're wearing
a sports bra so it's really comfortable
and yeah so I got that then I got this
next is this top which I love it has
like a writing down the sleeves which
type so many shirts like this I just
love like some lettering down the
sleeves so it has these flames right
there and on the back and it says
thrills company with like a little palm
tree and it's cropped and it's like kind
of flowy like it's really really thin
soft cotton this is most comfortable top
I out probably like it's really cute
could literally go with anything black
jeans blue jeans leggings if you feel in
it then I have these pants which I
thought were a different thing when they
were online but I actually come better
now that I got them in person so they
are these really long flat high-waisted
skinny jeans with this lace up like
instead of buttons and a zipper it's
like this lace-up thing which I love
lace up like expecially for the pants
these are really cool and I've been
looking for these literally everywhere
and I found them on their site and I
thought they were going to be jeans but
it's like super stretchy like they're
like lighting materials
we'll see jeans up and they're so
comfortable like I can't explain you how
litte comfortable and they're just like
tight and fitting and they just look
really nice because you know one like
you want to wear jeans and look nice but
you just kind of want to be comfortable
to wear a pair leggings that's when you
get these bad boys out then I just got
some accessories I got two grams of
sunglasses these ones are my fave
there's these like a rose gold I know
like point over here these are so cute
I'm obsessed with these and get makes on
those because like in the middle of the
night I'll put sunglasses on the head or
like just to accessorize I'll put them
on my shirt like I just love sunglasses
so much these are probably going to be
like my everyday summer ones we can just
look so good also got just a classic
black like aviator style
I love these dissolve users it's cute
and the last thing I got was this it is
this body chain it's this cool body
chain which I thought was really cool
doubles up around your waist so you
probably can't see down there know if
you can see but it's like a small one
and then like a longer one so super keep
everything really cool using your
creative with it I think it's cool you
can get creative with it like tying
however you want so that is all I have
I'm seriously obsessed with everything
