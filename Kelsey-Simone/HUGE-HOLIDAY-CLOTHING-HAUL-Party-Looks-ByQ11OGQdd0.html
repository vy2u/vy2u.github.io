bloo-hoo hey guys so for today's video
I'm really excited we're taking a little
break from the vlogmas to do more of
like a professional sit-down video for
you guys but don't worry we're still
keeping it festive I'm doing like a
holiday party sort of Tryon so
everything is just either like a nice
dress heels we have tons of cute stuff
but also casual stuff if you like a
casual party to go to
I know tons of people during the
holidays go to events Christmas parties
at New Year's parties or even just
Christmas Day I mean I get dressed up to
go down to my living room on Christmas
every single year I also know that
during the holiday time and not
everybody has the biggest budget to
spend on a party dress for this video I
have partnered with boohoo which is a
website that has tons of trendy clothes
but they're also very very affordable
not only hold on just wait a second
not only are they very affordable I have
a 50% off discount code for you guys in
the description and they have tons of
great sales on their website all the
time so you're welcome so everything
that I have is from boohoo as well as
everything that I'm wearing do
everything that I have will be linked in
the description as well as just boohoo's
links so that you can you know browse
around if there's anything you want to
look for girl go get you a fly dress for
50% off and look good in it so yeah I'm
in love with all these pieces I can't
wait to show you guys let's get into it
well first let's start off with what I'm
wearing is a boohoo thing this is a
trying haul so you guys will see me try
everything on in style it but first I
have these earrings you know I love gold
jewelry and you guys also know I love
rhinestones so this is just a very just
blingy nice eye catching piece to wear
they have a more star shape but honestly
to me it looks like a little snowflake
so they give a very Christmasy vibe if
you know what I'm saying
and then what I'm wearing right now I
have this like two-piece plaid set it's
like a bandeau top like a strapless
shirt with the high-waisted dress pants
which have like a black stripe down the
side I'm in love with this and this that
can be dressed up and
I feel like this could be one of those
like model off-duty airport looks where
you could just wear this with some like
white Stan Smith's and a little backpack
and you're good to go but then also you
could wear this with like super cool
black heels and like a cropped black fur
jacket and tons of jewelry all of a
sudden you're going to like a launch
party you know you can totally dress
this up or down however you want so it's
versatile looks I love things like this
and it's very comfortable I honestly
feel like I'm wearing PJs right now like
these feel like pj pants they're so
insanely comfortable so now for
everything else i wanted to dive
straight into shoes I only have two
pairs but I love both so the first
parent that I have these boots are sort
of kendall Jenner inspired I'll put the
picture on the screen over here they're
like these really glittery just heeled
boots you can wear these like thigh high
or you can scrunch them down um I
believe they also come in black too but
if you don't want to pay as much as
Kendall did for her glitter boots you
can get these from boohoo 50% off
discount codes in the description I
can't wait honestly they look kind of
cool with this outfit too I can't wait
to style them they look really sick then
the next pair of shoes that I have I've
been looking for shoes like this
everywhere but they are these black
heeled shoes that lace all the way up
your thigh do you see how long these
strings are these shoes do take blood
sweat and tears to put on but once you
put them on it's worth it because they
look so good so I'm going to move into
the rest of the clothes and then I just
have a couple random things
the first clothing item that I have is
this this was on the front page and I
was going on their website and I was
instantly like at carp
it is see-through so you do have to wear
like a bralette or like a black bando
top under it or you get creative put
whatever you want underneath so it's
like this long-sleeve wrap top but the
print is velvet and then it also is
covered in glitter which is so cool it
comes with a built-in choker which I
think is kind of cool see that part it's
like attached to the collar so it just
goes around your neck I love wrap tops I
think that whole trend of like wrap
dresses wrap tops
I love the whole vintage thing coming
back I think it's a super cute trend so
the next thing that I do have is a dress
it is
get a strap it has buttons all the way
down the middle I've been loving the
trend of these long dresses I think
they're super flattering I used to think
they weren't flattering on me because
I'm a little bit short but if they cut
you just at the right place under the
knee and then you wear a pair of heels
you're good to go so this is the most
comfortable dress I probably ever worn
it's so ridiculously comfortable it just
feels like a t-shirt and then it comes
with this so that you won't be cold
there's a long-sleeve black duster in
the same material so it just kind of
like matches together
okay this piece is so Christmas I'm in
love with it it's this red sabar coal
did you see how sparkly it is oh my god
so it's this like body con it like slits
down the front though but it's strapless
and Wow
I was like I want to be that glamorous
on Christmas you know so this was the
dress that stuck out to me for that
Christmas queen sort of look so if
you're going for that look this
Christmas definitely pick this up oh I
love these I couldn't wait for these to
come in the mail they have these buckles
at the end of the pant that are so super
cool I they give that sort of edgy
player that I really like with their
dress pants at the same time they're
like this charcoal gray they're not
exactly black they're just like a dark
grey and they have such a silky texture
to them they're so soft there's just so
many ways in my head that I would style
these like I'm so excited to have this
in my wardrobe and just style them like
crazy okay if you're into matching sets
like I am like this set I have one for
you
so this set starts off with a bandeau
top just like this one and it's just
like a white bando top and then the
pants I really really like they're like
these flowy sort of gaucho pants so
they're like almost like a pre length
like they're high-water on your ankle
which I really like the look of that and
then they also have this like tie around
the front which i think is really really
cool to like cinch your waist in like
and these are like pj pants I swear all
of Vu's clothes have the most
comfortable material it feels like
you're wearing pajamas like a hundred
percent of the time now we have this
which I feel like my loyal subscribers
are gonna freak out that I'm wearing
something colorful I know we're
venturing into this realm of colors so
this
I really liked I really wanted a dress
like this one that had a cowl-neck I
know that those have been super on-trend
and I didn't have any and I think
they're so pretty it's like I have to
get one and it's just body con all the
way down I love this dress now you're
probably Kelsey you're gonna freeze to
death no no I'm not gonna freeze to
death because this one also comes with
the matching little jacket it's super
long it has like little slits at the
bottom so it like the way it flows and
you can like spin around in it it's
really pretty so it's all satin and
silky so I love the way it flows and
like how it catches the light is so
pretty the last clothing piece that we
have is this jacket now I mentioned in
my most recent trendler that my favorite
jacket right now is furry like long sort
of trench like jackets it's like this
dark grey furry jacket it has pockets it
has a hood but what I really like about
this jacket I'll show you in the Tryon
is the way that it cinches at the waist
I've never had a jacket that does this I
think it's the coolest thing ever and I
wish all my jackets did this so it
buttons up and then it zips and then it
has these black ties around your waist
that cinches it all together so you can
even close up the jacket and you'll
still look cute thank you I love this
and then we have two more things we have
another accessory and then just a random
thing back again with the golden
rhinestone I picked up this necklace
though it's this rhinestone necklace
that has this rhinestone gold chain that
goes down the middle I think is really
cool if you have like a v-neck sort of
dress or top like the cowl-neck top and
have this just go in the dress so that
this just goes down the center I think
this is so cool um I really like it I
think it just adds something super
special to your outfit and then the last
thing that I have I saw this on their
site and I had to get it because I do
plan on throwing a New Year's party this
year or at least just having friends
over these are like those things you see
on Pinterest I'm so excited to have them
there these clear balloons with gold
stars in the middle um I'm really good
at the throw a party and have these
because they're the coolest things ever
they're actually really inexpensive I
would have expected these like
confetti balloons to be really expensive
and there's five in a pack so yeah you
can pick these up if you're having a
party or if you just want to put it in
your room I honestly might just put them
in my room because they're really cool
sadly we're done that is everything that
I have from boohoo again thank you so
