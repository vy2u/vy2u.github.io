see please what's up guys if you're new
to this channel hi my name is Kelsey as
you can see we have a new look going on
today this is a whole new meet you know
whole when I said new your new me I'm in
it I feel like I have two opposing sides
in my head ones like oh we're the pretty
dress no don't worry the dress I'm in a
good mood today you know I'm feeling
this orange look it's new it's fresh but
don't worry I'm not going all softie on
you guys I'm wearing handcuff earrings I
had to just throw a little bit of spice
and edge in there otherwise it wouldn't
have felt right today we're doing a hall
featuring zap oh I have done tons of
halls sponsored by sofa before and I
always get a really good response you
guys seem to love them and you actually
request for me to do more of them so for
this video I partnered up with sappal so
thank you guys for sending me all this
stuff they send me so much cute stuff
this is gonna be a try and all because I
know you guys especially with online
clothing you want to see how it looks
today we have shoes bags accessories
bathing suits clothes we've got a little
bit everything I'm gonna be trying on
everything I'm just not gonna be trying
on the bathing suits cuz modest is the
hottest if you don't know exactly this
Apple is a fashion website they have
super affordable clothes but really cute
trendy stuff I mean I have some pieces
in there you're gonna be blown away I
have some really cute pieces also zaple
is having a Women's Day sale they're
having it March 6th through the 16th so
hey I didn't even know that was a thing
but it's another excuse to go shopping
right what a better way to celebrate
Women's Day just go shopping and save
tons of money you're welcome I know
everything that I talked about will be
linked in the description as always that
those links will be down there I think
that I'm gonna start with the shoes I
never start with shoes but I have two
pairs and I really wanted to talk about
them so the first pair that we have are
these they're of course these fake
leather little booties they're sort of
cropped they have a heel all of these
studs in a zipper up the zipper is
actually fake which does make sense the
real the birds back here I think they're
really adorable I I would honestly wear
it with something like this like a
really girly sort of flowy dress one
thing I did want to mention is sizing
because I get a lot of comments that you
want to know like what size that I
always get stuff in when I buy shoes
from Zaap oh I do just get my actual
size and they always fit me perfectly I
don't have to like size up or anything
and then the other pair of boots I have
are these which actually also kind of go
with my dress I would also kind of wear
this with my dress but they're these
white boots that actually have a square
toe which I don't have I don't think any
boots that have a square toe it's super
70s and I think it's really cool I like
it and then they have this chunk heel so
on the inside I don't know if you can
see but they have like fur on the inside
these are the most comfortable boots
I've ever worn even though they're
healed even if you can't walk in heels
if heels aren't comfortable for you
I do recommend getting these shoes
because they're so comfortable I could
walk forever in these no I think I'm
just gonna go straight into the clothes
first for clothes we have these hoodies
I got two I got one in black one in
white my normal colors the fabric that
they use is super warm and it's super
soft and comfortable they have like a
little logo up here I'm always looking
for stuff like this because especially
where I live it gets pretty cold here
I'm always looking for super cute
comfortable just sweaters and hoodies to
wear all the time like that it's like a
half effort turtleneck it's not really
like a turtleneck but it has like a high
neckline I think it's cool I don't have
any shirts like this I really like it I
like the way I think it's cool also got
it in white this sweater in particular
comes in like a bajillion colors it
literally comes in so many colors super
soft the snuggly levels of this sweater
I give maybe like a 9 out of 10 def def
snug the next thing that I got is this
dress now I actually already have this
dress in black I think the last time I
did a haul with sappal I also got this
dress in black and I loved it so much so
it's like this silk satiny material it
has like a super low open back and it
has a straight-across neckline I like
the way that it looks on me I think it's
flattering so gorgeous it looks very
like luxury and booze but it ain't
priced bougie which is great and then we
have another dress which is sort of
similar to the one I'm wearing now it
has that sort of vintage style to it
this is a black and white sort of like
floral II it looks like a little soy
bean leaves I
even know what a soybean leaf looks like
it has a little strap so cuz it's like a
wrap dress so you tie it around and it's
actually pretty long one thing with this
dress that I love is the fabric of it
you cannot see through it which is great
because a lot of the times for some
reason people make wrap dresses with
super thin material but this one has a
pretty thick fabric like you cannot see
through this at all which I appreciate
so highly this is a fun number I love it
it has like a little collar to it I love
these sort of dresses I think they look
really flattering I'm trying to wear
them as much as I can while they're
still hot and trendy okay so the take
Todd that I picked out is this like one
shouldered sort of cropped bralette I
originally when I first saw the
one-shoulder shirt trend I actually
didn't like it but I like it now which I
don't really know what made me change my
mind
but I like it now but then they also
sent me like this same tank top with
just like a thinner strap I don't know
what happened why they sent me both
maybe they just weren't sure which one I
wanted then I picked out these shorts
which I was really excited because I
never buy denim online like jeans or
shorts never buy it because I don't know
the way my body is I have to try pants
on they almost never fit like never I've
never bought a pair of pants online
where they fit me really nicely
these fit me hallelujah thank the Lord
Jesus amen
they're like these high-waisted they're
sort of like medium wash shorts and
they're pretty distressed which is nice
and then they have this sort of black
lace-up going down the side which i
think is a really cute detail I'm always
looking for things to sort of spice up
my short game because I feel like all of
my shorts look exactly the same there's
so much orange in this shot right now I
have this body suit from zaple already
this is another one that I went back to
get more they sell these in a couple
different colors I have it in black and
olive green I decided to get this more
like muted curry orange color I think
this is a really pretty color I like the
fit of this bodysuit I like to just
straight across neckline I've been
loving any sort of top or dress or body
suit with the straight-across thing I
wear this all the time in summer okay
then we've got these pants which
obviously you'll see it better in the
Tryon I have it laid
to them up yet for some reason it took
me this long to get a pair of these
lace-up black pants because I love them
I think they look so good on everybody
they would go with so much of my clothes
but for some reason I've just never
bought them so I saw them on their site
and I was like ok mom was gonna get
herself a pair and so I did they come on
lace when you buy them on zaple which i
think is kind of smart India anyway so
that way you can lace them up to fit you
so they're kind of just like black
legging material but they look like
actual pants cuz they have like a button
umm I thought they were gonna be like
pant material but they're not they're
like legging material but I'm not gonna
complain about it because they fit me
really nicely and honestly the leggings
are more comfortable anyways the last
sort of clothing piece that I have is
this tank top I probably won't be
wearing it cuz it's like a pretty big on
me again it's got that super comfortable
stretchy material it has a cute shape to
it but just personally on me it's a
little big now we're gonna move on to
the bathing suits I'm excited because
napple has the best bathing suits they
have the trendiest of cuts and then once
you find one you like they have such a
big variety of colors in them that makes
me so happy this was probably the number
one that I was excited to get I am so in
love with this bathing suit it's got
this black white and yellow stripe on it
uh the shape is just like a basic sort
of like string tie top and then the
bottoms are really really high waisted
quickly I do want to say if you're more
like me where you're a little bit more
conservative a lot of samples bathing
suits a lot of them are bit cheeky so
keep that in mind every now and then you
can find a pair that has more
conservative bottom next bathing suit
that I got is this leopard one which
I've been loving leopard print this one
has like little knots at the top which
is super cute bottoms are a little bit
cheeky again how does
nope so this one's a bit confusing so
it's like it's like a vest almost if you
think about it like a vest um so I got
in this navy blue color it's got a
ribbed material I like the navy blue I
don't think I have like anything TP blue
and then it just has sort of just like
regular typhus I'd bottoms last summer I
got a red bathing suit for example and
it was like my most worn bathing suit
because I don't know I think the
combination of having like a really nice
tan with a red bathing suit look so
pretty
so I decided to get this one that has
like a little knot tied in the front
again it has that like sports bra sort
of shape to it which I like they're very
comfortable and then the bottoms again
the bottom blue gotten super cheeky
bottoms this is obviously not like a
public or family swimming occasion
bottom then I picked out this basic
black one-piece it has like a lower back
just because I like black one pieces
it's just sort of like my go-to bathing
suit I don't know I think they look good
they're easy they're simple they go with
everything all of the bathing suits that
I have I do just get them in a small I
get them in my regular size but I would
recommend sizing up I'm just a very
small person in general that I don't
need to size up but if you are sort of
guessing that maybe you should then do
it
the next one that I have has like
normal-looking bottoms yay and then it
has for the top the one-shoulder I have
like three things that look like this
now we have the one shoulder last two
bathing suits that I have we have one
that's sort of like this picnic print
this one has little bows like ties on
the shoulders which is really adorable
again we got that sports bra thing going
on pretty decent bottoms with little
bows on the hips and then we have a
white bathing suit again good bottoms
love these it's super ribbed like it has
like long ribs on them which I love that
and then it's just a regular like bando
white top but it does come with straps
to attach if you want the straps I mean
I probably will I love the look of the
bando bathing suit top but I always have
a fear 24/7 it's gonna fall off last but
for definitely not least we
accessory I have two bags and then some
randos the first bag that we have looks
very good shape I love my black and gold
combo that's like my go-to for pretty
much anything but expecially bags that's
just like my thing you have the velvet
mixed with leather gorgeous and it
actually has pretty good room inside and
then again we have our black and gold
combo this one is super cool it has this
little string at the front where you can
tie a bow which I think is like a really
cute detail it has like the black top
and then like the chain going down you
have the gold chain in the middle with
the buckle which I love buckle details
we have these Sony's which I love these
they're so sharp they've got that
tortoise shell look that I love I love
the shape of them I think they're super
cool and then then I got two pairs of
earrings which I am so obsessed with of
course both gold the first pair that I
have are these huge paperclip hoops
which are the coolest thing I have tons
of like just earrings that are just like
paper clips but never like a gigantic
paperclip hanging from a hoop I love
them and then I also got these smaller
gold hoops with little crosses on them I
love crosses I love wearing them in my
jewelry so that is all that I have for
