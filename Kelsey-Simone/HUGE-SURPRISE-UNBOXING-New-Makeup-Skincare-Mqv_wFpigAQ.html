I would do a little unboxing for you
guys I decided that I wouldn't open up
packages for a couple days and just open
them up all on camera so I have no clue
what's in here so I have all of these
boxes now this isn't a fan mail these
are press kits which is one of the
amazing parts of doing what I do
basically what that is is companies will
send me their products either they want
me to try out or they think I'd like or
sometimes even their newest products
that might have not even come out yet so
that's what all of this is normally I'll
post that on my snapchat story if I get
a box that I think is really cool so if
you like seeing all the press kits and
all the newest products I would
recommend following me on snapchat but
I've seen people do it before where they
just open it up on camera I thought that
was a cool idea so I was like why not
let's do it
I do I need scissors though let me get
scissors okay so I thought I would start
with this huge two-faced one first
it's the biggest box that I have that
worked okay just to let you guys know
Too Faced easily hands down has the
coolest and most extra press kits I've
ever seen they've given me
glitter roller blades before so many
just fun things two-faced
