so for today's video I have a bunch of
really fashion-forward fall slash sort
of holiday outfit ideas for you guys
this video I've partnered with Lulu's so
almost everything that I'm wearing is
from Lulu's calm of course all of the
items that I'm wearing will be linked in
the description below for you guys but
there's some really exciting things
going on at Lulu's this month from now
until the 21st Lulu's has a spinner on
their website that will give you some
really cool discounts things even like
50% off your entire order so if you see
some really cute stuff that you see in
the lookbook and you want to get a
discount on it you can definitely go on
their website and do that you can redo
the spinner every single day and when
you do it you're automatically entered
into a drawing to win $1,000 shopping
sprees you can literally buy like
everything in this cookbook so basically
what you went in the spinner is valid
until midnight and then you have a
chance to spin again the next day I
don't know if you want to use them all
up and shop every single day I mean that
could be fun
but also when you use the spinner you'll
also be signed up for Lulu's VIP so what
that means is you will have early access
to their Black Friday sales so you'll be
able to get them on Wednesday the 22nd
most of Lulu's best selling items that
are rarely discounted will be discounted
then so if there's anything you've been
having your eye on or anything you've
seen in one of my videos before that
you've been really wanting definitely
it's a perfect time to get it the
promotion is for us residents only but I
will have all the links and all the
information in the description below for
you guys so now we'll get back into the
lookbook I'll show you some of my really
adorable fall cozy comfy outfit ideas
