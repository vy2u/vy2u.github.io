it's Kelsey so today I'm going to be
doing a really really requested video
this is how I edit my Instagram picture
guys always ask me how I edit my
Instagram pictures and how I keep my
white minimal fee so I just jotted down
a couple of tips that I use I'll show
you the apps that I use and just how I
maintain my feed really really white
really really classic and neutral toned
and how I keep it minimal because it is
it is a pretty hard thing to do so I'm
going to be telling you some of my
Instagram secrets and it ah don't forget
to follow me on Instagram I think this
is about Instagram you knew it was in
there somewhere you knew I had to put a
plug for my Instagram by the way you
guys are probably like Kelsey you keep
changing your room but I'm actually in
my guest room because the lighting was
really nice first off I'm going to talk
about the apps that I use by the wayside
no I'm not sponsored by any of these
apps users just apps that I really
actually like to use this saved my life
with the new vsco cam update I hate the
new vsco cam update because you used to
be able to see the layout of your
Instagram and would be able to tell what
it would look like now it's all jumbled
up and they it just doesn't look good so
this app my mom actually introduced me
to because my mom has a pretty pop and
feed too basically it's called plan only
like plan only shows you what your
Instagram people look like which I think
this is one of the most helpful things
ever
I want to obviously be able to know what
a picture will look like with my feed
before I post it I like to compare I let
all my whites to be the same way white
can have a blue or a yellow undertone
you can change this in the temperature
you can do this both on the camera roll
editor or vsco cam I sort of have like a
blue undertone I feel like it's more
like cool tone or warm tone if you like
this is just probably the most helpful
app ever it's so helpful if you are
trying to get an Instagram feed weather
minimal or not this is really important
to help you see how everything's going
to look before you post it now the app
that I use for filters in Cisco cash so
vsco cam I use four filters and actually
the filter that I used to use was a c3
c3 was a limited time filter and I read
we had a problem with my phone and got a
new phone literally like less than a
week ago so I've lost the filter I don't
happen anymore but I don't use it
anymore I mean it kind of it wasn't
really like a filter it sort of just
brightened and picked up the contrast so
I mean you can still do that manually
but if you have s III that is a filter
that I did used to use and it was really
good I loved that filter so much I'm so
honestly so mad that I don't have it
anymore
but in this cocaine this is where I take
my time to krump the picture in the way
that I want I sharpen it no more than
three because I feel like afterwards
three it starts to look a little bit too
edited or turn it black and white and I
just use the normal basic - black and
white filters that they do have I don't
try to use too many black and white
pictures if I have a picture I really
really want to post but the colors
didn't match your feed I'll turn it
black and white just so that it still
matches my feed and that I get to post
you know the picture that I wanted to
post um so that's just kind of like a
little hack
but the editing tool that I like to use
is free and you already have it it is
literally in your camera roll who edits
in their camera I recently started
editing in my camera roll let me go to
my photos that would be helpful so that
I know what I'm talking about you get
all of these sort of effects the
exposure your highlights shadows
brightness contrast and black point
black point is something I use a lot it
basically just makes the blacks and
darker might be basically summed up is
like all neutral tones like white black
gray obviously skin color I naturally
just wear a lot of neutral tones so I
mean it's easy for me um but if you feel
like the lighten was really bad or
you're just shooting something like this
where you feel like the lighting made it
look yellow or me to look too blue what
I use is face to face to has a whitening
thing this is saved
so many of my pictures but the outfit
picture of me with a black background
the floorings that picture isn't
actually that light gray color it was
yellow and I turned it that color just
with the whitening tool I think one of
the key tips that I have one of the
essential elements to getting a minimal
feed is having a lot of negative space
pictures and fillers for my Instagram I
post fillers of either just kind of you
see on my video
is how I'm in the center and the focus
is kind of on me and then there's like a
lot of negative space as you would say
this is kind of what I mean by keeping
it giving it that minimal field blank
space on the picture just to like keep
it really open and uncluttered so that
your eye
only focuses on one thing there's not
tons of stuff going on in the picture
you just sort of freshens it up and if I
have maybe a selfie and then a picture
of my friends and a picture of my outfit
like it's too many people it's too much
clutter to give it that minimal look
I'll post a filler in between those
pictures another thing that I think is
really important is to choose about
three maybe four main colors because I
feel like the more colors there are a
few of like seven or eight different
colors in your feed one it's not going
to look like much of a feed because
there's not a cohesiveness of color and
tone I feel like it's important for you
to have like a good set like this is the
tone I want these are the colors I'm
going for I feel like that's really
important also I decide whether I want
my feed more bright or more dark because
I use black and white feeds sometimes
I'll either do like all-white with like
little touches of like black and gray or
like a lot of black with a touches of
white and gray so another tip that I
have there's this one tip that I don't
actually hear a lot of people talking
about in videos like this what I do is I
kind of like categorize my picture I
categorize it into like I post selfies
and post out put pictures I post product
shots and fillers that's mainly about
what I shoot categorized rotation if you
will like um I try not to put too many
people together is what I'm saying this
gives it that minimal look as well so
say I'll post a selfie because I post a
picture of my face I don't want to post
another selfie after that that would
look weird like two zombies in a row and
I also don't want to post an outfit
picture picture of me right after I just
posted another picture of me so I'll
post a selfie uh post or product shot
and outfit picture of filler and then
keep that going sometimes I don't
strictly follow this rule just because I
have so many pictures I want to post I'm
just like oh I'll just post this and it
looks good but normally what I do post
you'll notice that I never post like two
pictures of me in a row as you notice
there's a picture of me my friends a
filler a selfie a filler and picture of
me a filler a selfie so it's like I try
to like rotate it out between like a
cluttered picture a more minimal picture
so that it looks just sort of more
organized
thing that I do is get inspiration for
my pictures it's always good to have a
plan I do take a lot of pictures at home
in my room and like selfies but like
normally when I go out like it's always
good to have like just an open island
look for a location like if I see like a
huge black marble wall I'm going to take
a picture in front of it and just look
for photo opportunity so it's good to
have inspiration you're head of some
pictures you're planning up I want a
picture sort of like this like even want
to hang out with my friends I'll direct
message them Instagram picture ideas
like hey look let's get group pictures
like this or like let's do this sort of
pose or like if I want someone to take a
picture of me
I'll show them an inspiration picture
that I have in like hey can you sort of
take this kind of picture of me
everybody I tell about this they
instantly start using it is on your
actual camera when you're taking a
picture if you have a brighter more
white minimal feed like I do it's good
to have great pictures and if you're
taking a picture and it's looking sort
of dark or the lighting just isn't great
when you focus the camera you'll notice
there's this little sundial on the side
and if you click that and raise it up it
will instantly brighten your picture
this saves time from editing it just
makes the picture look better it helps
with the lighting base honestly lighting
is key awesome Pro lighting tips that I
use for any pictures even my videos have
the Sun in front of you and not behind
you that is a mistake so many people
make where they think they see the Sun
and they look oh it's so bright and then
they stand in front like of the Sun like
say if the Sun is right here this is the
Sun they stand here and have the person
take their picture that's incorrect you
want the Sun to be in front of you have
your person who's taking your picture
stand in front and have the sunlight
sort of on you just kind of like one eye
light for a video or even taking a
selfie stand in front of the windows as
sunlight is directly on me not behind me
when it's behind you
the camera is naturally going to want to
focus on the Sun and on you and it will
make you darker or if the Sun is bright
enough it will completely make you look
black and you will just be a silhouette
I mean unless you're going for like a
weird tumblr movie picture and you
wanted it then sure but yeah normally if
you're taking it selfies you have like
the light even like you know those
looming cases like the light should be
on your face not only from coming from
do I hope those tips help you guys I
mean that's what I do for my Instagram
