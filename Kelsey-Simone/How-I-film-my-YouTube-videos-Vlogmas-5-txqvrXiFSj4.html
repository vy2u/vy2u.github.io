the bathroom so sorry if it's like a
little echoey but I need to get ready I
just took a shower because we're filming
a YouTube video today this Friday's
video is not going to be a vlogmas it's
going to be like a regular video I need
to do my hair I think I'm going to put
extensions in it today so yeah I'm just
gonna get ready and do my extensions and
then I'm gonna do my makeup
oh okay so by the way I'm and cook brave
new world albums really good so right
now I'm doing my makeup I'm getting
ready I painted my nails the color that
I have on my nails right now it's from
Essie it's called Fifth Avenue if you
wanted to know see everything set up the
cameras charging I'm using the new lens
that we shot on like we took the
pictures for the photo shoot yesterday
so I'm shooting with that lens so we'll
see how it looks cuz I haven't used it
yet
and then my set is pretty much set up
and then I just have to get all the
stuff for the video bring it over here
today is my parents anniversary so
they're going out to dinner so her so
I'll just be home alone here so my dad
just ran to the store to buy me of
ennoble pizzas cuz I have like nothing
to eat here for dinner so oh it's just
me and you guys tonight okay so here's
the look in natural lighting again it's
kind of just like my simple everyday
makeup look um yeah I pretty much do the
same thing every day okay so this is the
camera that I use the Canon 5d Mark 2
this is what I normally use to film my
videos and then the lens that I have on
it right now the new one that we bought
is the canon sigma art 35 millimeter
lens so that's what I'm gonna be filming
with today okay so for lighting I have
my camera on my tripod right now and I
have a big it's super bright but I have
a big soft box here pointing straight at
me wow it's bright
this isn't always the way I light my
videos it's honestly different every
single time but I have a big soft box
you can get these on Amazon there is a
window here that gives me a little bit
of light um so I just needed some light
from this side cuz there was like a lot
of shadows so I just have my ring light
pointed over here to like take away all
the shadows from this way you can also
get ring lights on Amazon
that's where I got mine and they come
with the stand and everything and then
here are my camera settings for you guys
in case you wanted to know so I have
just changed I have my little outfit of
what I'm wearing and look at my way I
love the lighting of a ring light I
think it looks so good we're filming
like half the video today and then the
rest of the half tomorrow and we're also
taking pictures like Instagram and
thumbnail pictures tomorrow so you guys
will see that too but we're gonna go
someplace actually really cute for the
pictures that I'm thinking in my head
and I want you to see anything because
this video is going to be up before this
video that I'm filming so I can't really
tell you what I'm filming and I can't I
can't really let you see anything either
but yeah so we're about to film
everything set up the camera set up I'm
actually gonna set more over here hey
guys so for today's video haha hey guys
so for today's video I'm really really
excited I have okay that's not what I
was gonna say why is it so for today's
video I'm really excited we're taking a
little break from the vlogmas thing to
do a more professional suit on video for
you guys I filmed the whole entire intro
about ten times before I actually feel
like I get it right so okay let's do
this again give this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed and make sure to
subscribe down below I love you guys so
much I forgot to talk about my links
okay
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and make sure to check out my
links in the description also don't
forget to subscribe down below I love
you guys so much and I'll see you in my
next video Wow oh okay oh I just
finished my mouth gets so dry when
filming a video because I talk so much
uh literally filming a video and it's
just me talking for like three hours
like my mouth gets to arrive yeah so I
just finished um it's actually still
recording I was apparently only filming
on like an 8 gigabyte card so it kept
running out of room even though I just
removed everything off the card so I was
like what the heck is happening
and it was like card is full cards full
when I was like there's two clips on
here like how is the card full and so I
was freaking out but then I saw that it
was only an 8 gigabyte card so I had to
find my 35 gigabyte card so that I could
keep filming more cuz they kept shutting
off on me like stopping filming cuz the
card was full and I wouldn't know so I
would keep going and just be like oh my
god it hasn't been filming for the past
20 minutes so I had to go and get a
different card but thankfully we did it
so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm
gonna upload the footage so that I can
like review it just before I take the
sit down make sure there's like nothing
I forgot or like something that was like
you know out of focus I have to refill
mitt so I'm gonna look through
everything right now and then once
everything looks a-okay then I'm going
to clean up my room so I'm officially
obsessed with this lens but I'm gonna
show you how I basically do everything
so I'm gonna show you guys how I do the
whole like have this be my viewfinder so
first I have this application the way
that I found it was through I just went
to the actual Canon website like if you
have a Canon camera I'm pretty sure if
you can if you have another camera like
a Sony you can go to just the Sony
website and just type in the model of
the camera that you have and it should
be in the download links I mean I don't
know what the website exactly looks like
but it should be a download link on
there mine is just called an EOS utility
launcher so I'm sure yours would also be
along the lines of some sort of utility
launcher so you basically plug it in
with a USB court and then once the
cameras turned on it'll automatically
open up of this which then I hit my
remote shooting in camera settings and
it will open up a little panel over here
and then I just hit live view shoot and
you will automatically see what's on the
camera so that's what the camera sees
right now which is me
I'm just moving it with my hand look how
pretty if you want to know where they're
from just watch this Friday's video so
so I just finished making Milo of
an√≠bal pizza my clips imported now I'm
basically just moving everything over to
my desktop I'm not gonna edit this
tonight I'm gonna edit this tomorrow but
I'm gonna edit this vlog tonight so I'm
going to end it here
I would keep filming I've been watching
me and it would literally just be this
like you in just be me sitting like this
for like three hours I hope you guys
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
if you did to let me know
also make sure to subscribe down below
