was worn by kendall Jenner I know that
Kendall is a big trend setter and as
soon as I saw this outfit on Instagram I
fell in love with it and I wanted to
recreate it and when I really looked at
the pieces of the outfit I was like well
this is really simple I either already
have these pieces or it's something
that's pretty easy to get but I
personally already owned all of these
pieces so starting off at the top I'm
just wearing a post Malone t-shirt you
do not have to wear like an exact
t-shirt just wear any black band t-shirt
or honestly just even a plain black
t-shirt would work anything that sort of
has that grungy vibe and feel you know
it doesn't have to be exact but you can
really easily thrift t-shirts like this
mine is from the Urban Outfitters men's
section which mine I think was like
around 25 bucks for the bottoms I'm
wearing a pair of black Levi's jeans
these I did thrift myself and I did a
little DIY I cut the bottom of the jeans
off and just sort of frayed them hers
were like that too but I just already
had mine the same sort of way her isn't
the picture we're really oversized in
baggy but it's pretty easy to thrift
oversized jeans to sort of cinch her
oversized jeans around her waist she had
a belt which I really liked so I also
decided to add the belt it's just this
plain black leather belt with a gold
buckle that I did thrift and for the
shoes I also went with these white
heeled boots I will link both mine and a
couple other inexpensive ones if I can
find them down below that have this sort
of similar look because I know that
there's a lot of like really good online
shoe websites that have pretty
inexpensive but really good quality
shoes so she also for her bag had a
fanny pack but she used it like a
shoulder bag now I do have one fanny
pack but the strap was just so
completely different I decided to go
with this little vintage one that I
thrifted and I just tied it in a knot in
my back and for accessories she had her
little black vintage
Sony's on that I have ones that look
sort of like hers so I just paired it
with those I wear them so much and they
were only like four dollars but they
look good with actually everything ooh I
also really love this outfit that I
recreated from Kim Kardashian
surprisingly me and Kim have a lot of
the same pieces in our wardrobe there
were a lot of outfits of hers that I
could have recreated but I chose this
one I actually had it screenshotting in
my phone because I really liked her look
so starting off with a longer sort of
black furry coat I know mine's not as
long as hers but this is the closest
that I had the coat I have is from I am
Gia
I will link this coat below but I know
that I can definitely do better you guys
know me and my thrifty skills depending
on your budget this may not be the most
affordable one I'll link some below they
give off sort of the same vibe and have
the same look but are a little bit more
budget-friendly
I just wanted to wear this one because
in my wardrobe it was the closest of
what I had to the picture of her outfit
and then for the top mine is this black
long-sleeve wrap top from forever 21
it's just simple it's not the same as
hers but anything that's black and just
sort of had a deeper neckline and then I
paired it with this long gold chain she
had one mine has a scale on it
I got it from Amazon for ten dollars
everybody always asks me that
and then these jeans are again another
pair of thrifted Levi's they're super
oversized they're really long and baggy
ruched around the ankle and they have a
couple of little rips in them but mine
already came like that and then for the
heels I didn't have the exact clear easy
ones she has I have fake smoky looking
black ones but they give off the same
effect but adding to the realm of
sisters from Instagram I decided to do a
Kylie look so I scrolled through her
Instagram and I decided to pick this
matching two piece of leather outfit
which I really actually liked the top is
pretty much exactly the same as hers I'm
not sure where hers is from but mine is
from misguided it's just this haltered
mesh top obviously it's kind of
see-through so wear something under that
and then I have a leather jacket mine's
also from misguided I'll link it below
because they have really good priced and
really cute clothes um this isn't even
sponsored but also my skirt the leather
skirt is from misguided they had gifted
me some stuff a while back they honestly
have some really cute clothes the shoes
are from Zara but there are other places
that sell sock boots is
well I got mine on sale so they were a
really good price but sometimes Zara can
be pricey so I'll link some similar
looking ones below for you but yeah this
look was really easy to recreate and put
together I know that her skirt did have
some lace ups on the side but I just
didn't have one like that I just had a
plain leather skirt but it looked just
as good to be honest her leather jacket
also laced up on the side but forever21
has one exactly like it I actually own
it but I couldn't find it for the video
I'll link it down below for you guys so
whether you want lace ups or not I mean
honestly both look good to me
Kylie wasn't wearing a purse or really
much accessories at all in the picture
of this outfit besides a couple of rings
so I also kept my accessories minimal I
didn't really wear much of anything but
if you decide to recreate this look you
could easily wear this with some hoops a
couple of you know layered chains you
could wear it with a black bag or even
like a little mini backpack would be
really cute it was fun but also simple
and then the last look that I have was
worn by Sophia Ricci she pretty recently
posted this pic of her look on her
Instagram and I really liked it and it
instantly saw that I kind of owned
everything or at least a really simple
comparison so starting off with the coat
I have this furry leopard jacket that
I'm in love with I got mine last winter
from Topshop but I know that there are a
ton of places with of course more
affordable prices who have come out with
it since then so I will link mine and a
bunch of others below because you can
pretty much find these everywhere now
for my top I just have a cropped white
plain hoodie which I thrifted and then
just cut myself for the pants I got
these from boohoo and then the belt is
from a completely different thing it's
from a dress from boohoo that I just
used from the dress intended around my
waist but this was optional you don't
have to but I noticed that her pants did
have a nice belt I wore some plain -
silver hoops with this because she had
some mine I stole from my mom's closet
so technically they were free to me and
my heels are just a pair of just plain
nude strappy heels I'm not sure at all
where I got these from I don't remember
but again they're really simple I'll
link ones below that are like under 25
bucks as you can see these long free
trench coats are definitely trending for
this fall in winter so I highly suggest
getting one of course
the ones that I have are both fake fur
which also makes for a more affordable
coat if you guys want to see more videos

looks or trendy looks or seasonal
outfits whatever it may be leave a
comment down below and also make sure to
