sat down in this bed and phone to
talking video in so long
I just miss sitting on this bed sweating
with all these lights talking to you
guys don't eat I know you people in the
comments had you you stopped don't even
comment why are there sunglasses on my
head while I'm indoors five minutes ago
was dropped off from my mom while
getting lunch like I still even have my
shoes on I was just like let's just go
film right now so I didn't take my
sunglasses off plus they complete the
look okay so I decided to do a favorites
video I feel like I have a lot of new
favorite things to talk about to you
guys so I'm gonna start with makeup and
beauty stuff because I barely have any a
little bit one makeup product so this
makeup product this I talked about in my
last video what my so this is from milk
makeup this is the sunshine skin tint
and the packaging is so cool it's such a
good product to let me get into it so
it's a rollerball which is really cool
I've never seen a foundation with a
rollerball before you just like pump it
and then you like go like that and it's
such easy like fast application on the
type of person I don't like matte like
flat foundation I want to be like glowy
and dewy and like dimensional you know
like I just like a really fresh hydrated
foundation look like you can't feel it
on your skin it's so lightweight but it
gives really good coverage I wouldn't
say it's full coverage because I like my
freckles to show but it definitely has
more coverage that it being the cream
which I love it's like that perfect
in-between it's more than a beauty cream
but less than a full coverage like thick
foundation so the next product I'm going
to talk about like a combination that I
use like all together exfoliating is key
my favorite exfoliator is the ocean salt
it smells like if the ocean was like a
person and you like smell that person I
shut up guilty it smells really good
okay it's just like blue and like it's
this is a new like a refill because I
needed more this is so satisfying it's
not like a light little scrub it's
extreme it gets all your dead skin off
it's amazing it's a whole face and body
scrub so you can use over your whole
body which I literally do I take like a
mitt and I just like lather
like that exactly like that and sash
made that it's cool name
also another left product what attracts
me to this product is the scent I've
never been able to describe the scent
when I tell people about this product
I'm just like it's smells so good but I
never knew what to tell people that it
smells like and I finally found the
perfect description imagine your
favorite fall candle had a baby with
your favorite Christmas candle imagine
how good that would smell that's what
this smells like it like gives me fall
feels but then it also gives me
Christmas feels it but I just feel so
happy and it just both music and I just
want to run over my own Wat please go
buy this product but it is a lotion bar
and basically it's like solidified low
she's a little hide word oh my gosh
that's so big I never use big words
the last beauty product that I have is a
really recent purchase if you know me
you know that I love that Mario Badescu
rose water spray this is from fresh and
it is a rose facial toner now the Mario
Badescu spray doesn't really do much for
your skin it's just kind of like
hydrating and it feels really good it's
like refreshing but this is a toner so
and I never use toners but like I love
the feeling of mist on my face and just
like it's so like low-key easy like like
you see wow I just feel so relaxed right
now so it's really good for your skin
it's helping me to tone my face because
I never do that so I always rinse our I
face after take my makeup off then I'm
going to move on to fashion and I only
have three fashion things so the first
fashion thing that I have is pins I have
a little collections of pins that I've
started and I love them
this one is a Drake pin you guys may
have seen this I got this in Puerto Rico
all of these came in a pack like all one
two three four of these I got at
Nordstrom's and impact like ten dollars
in drink was 15 but it was so worth it I
like to put these either on like the
butt pockets of my shorts or like either
like a hat or you can put these on like
a backpack you if I wear like a plane
like sweatshirt or t-shirt I'll really
punch rip you know it's from a company
called pinch real hug this is my other
favorite the black lipstick and she's
like biting her lips so cute every fall
you hear denim on denim is going to be a
thing and I never listen I've never worn
denim on denim until this season and I
love denim
my gosh so one specific denim trend that
I've been loving is like ripped hem
jeans
so I've these jeans that like look at
the look at the bottom of the jeans like
how cool is that these I got from H&amp;amp;M
these that I wear a lot and they're just
like a square cut out on the bottom and
these are just Levi's from Urban
Outfitters a really easy DIY it I got
these ones that I di wide myself I just
thrifted these like high-waisted denim
jeans so many denim jackets because I
like pairing like jean shorts or like
jeans with like really cute jackets so I
have this like really distressed denim
one that I've worn before and it's just
like cropped and just like cut up in the
back and it's just super cute and then a
recent buy is this black like denim
trenchcoat thing with like white
stitching it's so cute I love it and
it's kind of covered in dog hair but
that's okay and then I also have my
denim Calvin Klein hat like I like
accessorizing with denim tune the last
fashion boot is fur and I love fur I
have so much first stuff I have this for
phone case that I got in some random
phone accessory place in Philly this bag
I get so many compliments on fur bag
that I actually did wear to playlist I
wear this a lot actually I got it at
some like random second-hand store in
Philly just like this really cute little
store but it's from algos I'm not sure
if they still sell it I have first slide
but I did DIY they're adidas Lud's that
I literally just went to the craft store
and bought Blackford have fur heels that
are really cute I got these from Lulu's
I did a haul with these and I have so
many so many first sweaters that I've
thrifted me fur jackets it's ridiculous
this one's from Urban Outfitters and
it's so cute though onto random I never
do random if I do it's like a candle or
something so I feel like I wanted to
make this video a little bit more
personal about like stuff that I
actually do like besides like fashion
makeup so I'm reading a book and it's
not the Bible oh my gosh like wow
Council you what what happened so I got
the Alexa Chung it book but recently I
found that there are just a lot of times
where I'm really bored to have nothing
to do like on flights or on trains or
just like even when I'm uploading but it
just has tons of pictures which makes it
easy for me to read
yeah it's just really good and I just
she's definitely a really inspirational
person for me because we're sort of in
the same industry and it's just a really
good book for me to read milah will be
joining us don't mind him
so I decided to buy some movies because
they take stuff off Netflix all the time
and I get really really mad and these
are some of my favorites bill and Ted is
my favorite movie
I even have like some merch from them
too so it has the excellent adventure
and the bogus journey in one which is
really cool and I really want to be them
