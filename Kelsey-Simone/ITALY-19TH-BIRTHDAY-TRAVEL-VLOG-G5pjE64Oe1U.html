Italy I have to like contain myself I'm
so excited I am in Italy right now it is
so beautiful we're here for my 19th
birthday
it is like five o'clock right now and
it's just like our first day here so we
did take a quick nap not gonna lie when
we first got here so this is just my
room where I'm staying I have to show
you guys this I have a couple skylights
one here one there and then one in the
bathroom but this place is so so pretty
and look at this bathroom holy crap this
is so pretty um I don't have a
full-length mirror for ootds that's in
my parents room but I'll show you that
anyways to show you like my full outfit
on sometimes getting dressed as well as
they have a little balcony and it's just
the view is so insane but the only
problem that we're sort of trying to
tackle right now is because we're
staying in a villa obviously we don't
have like the accesses you would
normally have with like staying at a
resort where there's like you know food
services so we do have to actually go to
a market to buy our own food which isn't
that big of a problem but it's just the
getting around that's hard because we're
staying sort of like countryside we're
staying a mirror right now we don't have
a car so we might have to rent one we
thought that it would be easier to like
get a little taxi and just like go
around places but it's not that easy
I'll keep you guys updated with what's
going on today because today is just
sort of like our settling in figuring
everything out day so I don't think too
much is getting like too much exciting
stuff is getting done today but tomorrow
we have tons of stuff plan it's so
beautiful I'm gonna show you the view
outside is the view oh my gosh it's so
pretty from my mom's balcony you just
sort of see out I don't I don't think
you can see it from right now but like
right along here is a river
morning right now that's back there
somewhere we're on a foe we're taking
like a little ferry to go where we're
going to eat we got lost like so far we
still are not 100% sure if we're going
the right way but an adventure it's so
pretty here look at this freaking lunch
view oh my god okay I'm so high I'm
definitely gonna order some pasta
because I have had pasta yet that's the
goal
it's so beautiful right now we're on our
gondola ride a weave there's a guy
playing it we rushed from lunch to get
here we're still like kind of hungry
though
we might go get food again but oh it's
so pretty here we're about to go into
the bridge
I know hi oh my god he's like not even
they don't care
so my parents got me a little birthday
present from Dior look how beautiful
this is we're trying to find a coffee
shop and we got lost
okay so we just made at home Venice was
so insanely beautiful I'm kind of
obsessed now I kind of want to move here
now um but I am so beat tired actually
making a cappuccino right now that's
actually not a good idea right before
I'm about to go to sleep whatever good
morning guys day three right now we are
in the car we're actually going to head
to a labyrinth which is so excited about
to go there it's not that far of a drive
I'm really excited it's like this
beautiful like mansion palace with like
a garden and like a labyrinth which I've
always wanted to go to to something like
that pictures are so beautiful so I'm
super excited to go there yesterday what
my parents got me from Dior they got me
these really pretty little earrings I
saw them in the case and I was like
completely obsessed with them I feel
like these are those kind of earrings I
can just wear them every day and they
look super cute with like pretty much
anything so and then I also got this
wallet I desperately desperately needed
new wallet did all these statues oh my
god I feel like I'm in one of my video
games or something this guy doesn't even
have a head oh my gosh
or an arm poor dude oh my god this is
like legit giving me the creeps like I
got chills right now this is so creepy
I hate statues I watched too much Doctor
Who I can't be around statues right now
we are at this Museum clay so there's
like the museum there and then there's
this gorgeous mansion back there right
now we're walking to where the labyrinth
is which was like the main thing I
thought this was I honestly didn't know
all this other stuff was here we have
kind of just thought it was a labyrinth
but we're looking for I think it's this
way it was like a huge tower in the
middle of the labyrinth which is like
obviously how you fought your way out
here's the labyrinth look how pretty
okay we're trying to go through this I'm
normally really good at these things
so we made it that was a lot longer than
this could be oh wow oh my god it's huge
what the heck I didn't
was that big here we are at the top look
how big this thing is
we just finished Inc finally got my
calamari I've been waiting for been
waiting to eat calamari all day going
under a bridge so it's gonna get dark
but we just took a personal little taxi
that we're on right now to go back to
see ya
yeah it's a water to hack a--they
because it's a bow obviously but yeah
we're just gonna go back home now we did
a little bit more shopping and tomorrow

taxi there good morning guys starting my
day off exactly how we ended it

all the way down to Lido right now which
is the beach that they have here in
Venice
I literally can't even see my screen so
I don't even know what I'm recording

tan
it's really bright I'm hoping the
European Sun does me good because I
never tan ever I just burn
good morning everyone sorry I didn't
properly like and the vlog yesterday um
I was so tired I didn't even remember we
kind of just bent the entire day at the
beach like we left to eat and we were
like what else we gonna do and we're
like it's just keep going back to the
beach so we need to spent the entire day
at the beach and then by the time we
were done it was already dark so we just
got something quick to eat on the same
shoes or Villa and just went straight to
bed didn't even think about finishing
the vlog but it is the next morning we
actually were so tired we slept in today
I think today we're doing a museum I'm
not really sure which one we haven't
really picked we just said that we
wanted to go to one so right now look at
this view we have for while we're eating
we just order some dessert and I can't
talk we just ordered some dessert I got
the Bombers chocolate cake

of Venice but it was called Murano we
just sort of walked around a little bit
saw some cute stuff got some good pasta
but I actually wasn't feeling really
well today and today was also the
hottest day we've been here so we just
decided to come back home we have a full
scheduled packed day tomorrow so we
