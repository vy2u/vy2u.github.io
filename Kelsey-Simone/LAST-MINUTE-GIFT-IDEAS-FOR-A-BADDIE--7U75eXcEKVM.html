tree is up I'm so happy
hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
like a Holiday Gift Guide just some like
ideas on what to get you know people for
Christmas if you really don't know cuz
I'm really bad at that all of these
products that I'm going to be showing
you as gifts are from the Ulta Holiday
Gift Guide on the Ulta website they have
like a whole gift guide which is
honestly really helpful I'm so happy to
be working with Ulta on this video all
these cool products that I have are all
from the ulties Gift Guide if you want
to get all the cool gifts I'm going to
show you or even just more gift ideas
you want some last-minute cool gift
ideas make sure to go to all TOCOM slash
Holiday Gift Guide
I'll have it somewhere on the screen so
if you literally have no idea what to
get someone or if you're just like on a
budget or if you're a last-minute
shopper I relate to all of those they
have literally the best gift ideas let's
get started I really kind of want to
keep all of these gifts for myself
so if you want to give like a really
really nice gift but you're kind of on a
budget I highly suggest this as a gift
name one person you know who loves
makeup who wouldn't want a really nice
makeup palette for Christmas palette or
a really good gift idea to get somebody
it's like you're getting them one
product but I mean you're technically
getting them multiple so this is the BH
Cosmetics Carli bybel palette and I love
the colors and tones in this if this
palettes just so nice because it comes
with four highlighters and then a whole
entire eyeshadow palette also sticking
with the palette thing I love
highlighter right now every makeup guru
on Instagram loves highlighter right now
highlighting is just like the thing
right now though what a better gift to
get in the honest Asha glow kit a friend
who gets you an honest object glow kit
for Christmas is definitely a friend
you'd want to keep this is something
that your friend would probably cry I
mean if my friend got me a glow ki drama
cry this is beautiful colors and a lot
of like it has like a lighter one so if
you're going for like a light then it
also has like a bunch of like warm toned
highlighters and this one right here the
champagne color just wow even like you
can literally get this for anybody if
your sisters into makeup
if your mom's into makeup if your
grandma likes makeup I don't know with
this next gift it's really inexpensive
as well but it's something that like
it's so nice
and I'd want to get it for Christmas I'd
give this to any of my friends for
Christmas in this little box what you
get is all these flowers but they're not
just flowers there are soap flowers
which you know like the idea of like you
know sprinkling like rose petals in your
bow this is soap so it's like soap
flower just makes your bath super luxury
and relaxing I love a good bath anybody
loves a good about everybody everybody
loves a good bath so these are just soap
flowers and I think they're really cool
it smells amazing also something that's
a really good idea is a rollerball said
I'm all about roller balls I honestly
have more roller balls than I do actual
perfumes so this is a Juicy Couture mini
perfume set which is really nice it's
kind of like like a book three different
Juicy Couture perfumes which I love all
those you stick to reviews they smell so
good so again this is something that
it's like so nice like who wouldn't want
to get perfume for Christmas
I mean perfume is such a nice gift to
get someone I kind of think about it
like if I would want it as a Christmas
gift like anybody else would want as a
Christmas gift yeah so this has the viva
la juicy Juicy Couture and Viva La Juicy
Noir perfume I have the people did you
see one it's one of my favorite perfumes
Don't Tell oh my god Wow okay another
good gift idea to get someone is
something really personal that you know
that they like or that they've talked
about before or that is their favorite
product if you know a product they've
been raving to about it's probably a
good idea to get them that so I have a
couple products here so I have this
product which is the large allure
illuminating stick and I my personal
favorite highlighter is this same
highlighter in the powder version the
gilded honey laura geller highlighter
and I had no clue they had illuminating
sticks highlight your face with and it's
so nice I'm I'm blinded and the stick
it's just it's so creamy and it makes
your skin look so dewy I know I smelled
it so I feel like sometimes it's just
like about the personal aspect rather
than just like some random item and then
the other product that I have is the dew
the hoola this is a liquid bronzer which
is really cool I love this bottle this
is a really cool bottle it dries to your
skin and it just blends super nicely
it's almost got this glitter to it
it doesn't have glitter in it but it
leaves your skin like super illuminated
you can use this on your face is like a
liquid contour or you could just like
put it all over and you
you just get like a super nice glow so
yeah definitely getting like a personal
item that you know that that person
would like it's a really good idea so if
you're not on a budget and you just
really want to treat somebody to
something really nice I have this gift
idea which is the straightening brush
which is super trendy right now it's a
really amazing product basically it's a
hair straightener but it's also a
hairbrush the brush bristles are made of
ceramic like a hair straightener so when
you brush your hair it just straightens
your hair um I am really curly hair so I
trade my hair a lot so this would be a
really good gift for me because I would
use it so much this would be a really
great gift for my mom cuz my mom also
straightens her hair all the time if you
don't have a budget go full-out get them
something that they really like and use
these are super trendy right now like
all those like Instagram beauty gurus
always have these doing their hair with
it I think this is a really cool
invention so you always need to brush
your hair but then like you need to
straighten it like I like never want to
brush my hair because it's so curly and
frizzy but like I need to straighten it
like I need to get the knots out so it's
like oh my god like but like imagine if
you could straighten and brush at the
same time that's what this is well
depending on your price range whether
you're on a budget and you only want to
spend like on maximum of twenty dollars
on a present or if you want to go all
out and get somebody something really
nice Ulta has movie so many gift options
I'll have linked below all the products
