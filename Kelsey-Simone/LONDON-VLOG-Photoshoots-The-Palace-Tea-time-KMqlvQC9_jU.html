way back here it wraps all the way
around the other side of the building

beautiful so I'm gonna get ready now I'm
gonna put on something cute outfit I
think we're just gonna like walk the
town right yep we're gonna find eat
lunch because I'm starving I didn't even
eaten anything yet today so I've just
gotten dressed we are going to go eat
now I'm not sure where exactly we're
gonna go eat but they have some
restaurants here so I think that's where
we're going to eat there's so much wind
but at least it's not raining it could
be worse hey a big red bus I'm living
every like One Direction fans dreams
right now hunger accidents from London
right yeah so we just finished eating
we're taking a walk now in the wind
reticulated
I spotted a cool sorry it's kind of loud
we're right next to the street but I
spotted a really cool picture place
while we were driving no when we were
driving to the hotel I found a really
cool pictures find it so we like yeah
it's basically just straight down from
the hotel so we're walking there and to
take some pictures this is Hyde Park oh
another red bus this is the park that I
went in my video game there's so many
cool places look what's your girl found
can I go inside of it wait I don't know
how to open it so we finally found the
place I wanted to take a picture right
here as you can see perfectly my
aesthetic so we just finished shooting
here it's so pretty
I think we're gonna walk back now
because they're really tired
and yeah so we just got back at Lancome
left all of these products for us to use
which is so cool I haven't even tried
some of these and then look how cute
this is ace Davis bottles of perfume

one says momager liz is that not so cute
so I am getting it ready to take my
bubble bath so I'm setting this all up
super pretty these flowers actually the
Dorchester sent up to our room and it's
so pretty I'm sure you guys probably
already saw this I'm like my social
media and stuff I need to start buying
this Thank You Lancome for turning me on
to a new candle because I didn't even
light that yet and it already smells
amazing I have a couple Lancome products
here I'm gonna use this body balm and I
need to wash my makeup off so I have
that there
I just got out my bath I have my lancome
exfoliating illuminating mask on mom's
about to take her bath and so we've been
noticing this pattern so I've been
joking about you know the secret doors
in the room that have like the food
behind them
I was joking that Nicolas Cage is behind
this one whatever not a funny joke and
not that funny so every time we turn
around okay we're the only people in
this room like nobody else is staying
here and every time like room service
comes to give us something they ring the
doorbell we have to answer three times
yeah and so every time we're just like
standing here and something appears like
so nobody came in just something up here
so we just noticed a fruit basket is now
here first it was what was the first
thing was these flowers yeah these
flowers just like appeared here nobody
noticed oh yeah and the products we
didn't notice those were there either
they just like showed up and then all
this fruit appeared over there on that
table I was sitting on the couch you can
even see where I was sitting on the
couch listening to music and then mom
comes out and she's like why is there a
basket of fruit and I'm like I don't
know like who put that there
good morning everyone I'm so sorry less
than I didn't give like an official and
the day vlog but it is now day to all of
our breakfast we're actually probably
gonna take it outside on one of the
tables and eat it out there just bring
the other chair over yeah last night
don't worry you didn't miss anything we
basically just had room service for
dinner and then went straight to bed and
I didn't really think too like vlog and
ending of the day so we just took our
pictures sitting outside candidly
pretending to drink our tea I'm actually
dying can you okay look how cute this
baby jar of Nutella is I'm eating my
fruit with it right now
I just finished eating my breakfast is
straight in my hair as you can see I'm
gonna get ready to do my makeup so first

use the Lancome aqua Vidal it's just
their hydrating instant moisturizer so
