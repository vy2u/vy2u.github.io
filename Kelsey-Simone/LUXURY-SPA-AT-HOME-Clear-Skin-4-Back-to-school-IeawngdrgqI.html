you how to get the most glowing radiant
skin whether you're going back to school
or whatever it is if you want to give
yourself a really nice facial recently
I've treated myself on going to a legit
spa and there was a lot of things that
they did to me that I normally don't do
in my skincare routine so I've been
taking home a lot of the tips and tricks
that they do in real luxury spas and
just doing them at home sometimes so the
first thing that I'll do is some
aromatherapy normally they'll put some
oils in their hands and run it over your
face so I like to light a candle and put
some really relaxing music on I just had
some worship on the first thing I'm
gonna do is remove all of my makeup I'm
gonna use a cleansing balm for this this
one's from pixie you can get this at
Target it's affordable it's amazing it's
the best ever for removing your makeup
it really gets it all off and recently I
found out that there is definitely a
difference between just removing your
makeup and cleaning your face so there's
gonna be sort of two cleaning processes
here
so first I'm rinsing that off which that
just removed just all the makeup and
dirt from the day and then I'm gonna
actually clean my face with this brush
this is the softest brush I've ever felt
in my life it actually is I think it has
like charcoal in it and then I'm using
this fresh soy face cleanser this is
actually going to clean out your skin
and I know I don't fake tan my face
that's why there's such a big color
difference there but I'm just gonna sort
of wet the brush run this around my face
and the little bristles really get into
your skin and make your skin so clean I
really noticed a difference between
doing both the cleansing and just doing
one now this is something I never used
to do but this is how they remove the
product from your skin is obviously
instead of dunking your face in a sink
of water they will use wet washcloths to
remove all of the product from your face
so I started doing that just sort of
soak the washcloth and like warm water
to remove all the product then what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna turn my sink as hot
as it can go and I'm gonna fill up a
bowl with some hot water I added fake
rose petals you don't have to do that
obviously and I also put essential oils
in it but I used this to steam my face I
don't have a real steamer but if you do
cool use it this is just like a little
DIY steamer that works perfect now I'm
gonna use this Rose toning essence from
this brand before I've never used them
before but they sent some stuff to me
and they're really nice this video is
not sponsored by the way this is all my
personal products but I'm gonna put some
of that on a paper towel use cotton
balls they're a lot smoother on your
skin but I didn't have any so I'm just
gonna run this over my face now that my
pores have been opened from the steaming
that is when you want to tone now the
next step is my favorite part I
seriously love exfoliating my face I
don't know why it's just so smooth
afterwards I'm gonna be using the sugar
face polish from fresh I use a lot of
fresh products in this video you'll
notice I love their stuff but this one I
think has like strawberry extract in it
so it's also going to chemically
exfoliate your face as well as
physically exfoliate your face which is
basically going to just get all the dry
dead skin cells off and it's going to
give you a whole new face seriously your
face is gonna feel so different after
this it's going to be the smoothest you
have ever felt it again using the towel
method just removing all the scrub from
my face the exfoliator is also going to
brighten your skin and just all around
make it beautiful then it is a mask time
I'm gonna use this vitamin nectar mask
from fresh this is a vibrancy boosting
mask so obviously it's gonna make your
skin super vibrant make it super bright
this smells incredibly amazing I love
using this bright and early in the
morning
it's very invigorating just wakes you up
I love it smells like citrusy greatness
if you have someone who's willing to put
up with you and your extra Ness thank
you mom and put your mask on for you you
can do that but you could also just put
it on yourself like a normal person once
that's off I'm going to start with the
moisturizing you can do either like a
serum oil like this these are also from
babor they're these glow boosters
they're really cool even though they're
in tiny capsules a little bit goes a
long way you can already see here the
glow on my skin it's a super intense oil
or you can just use a regular
moisturizer this one here is the Lotus
youth preserve cream this smells so
freshening I mean it is from fresh but I
love this one it's really good for
sensitive skin so if you do have
sensitive skin and dry skin and this
one's great I have like a collection of
moisturizers but I always go back to
using this one now I'm gonna do
under-eye cream this is like the only
one I have you obviously don't have to
use a Dior eye cream but this one I
really like because it comes with this
golden metal rollerball which is really
really cold so when you rub it in with
this it'll deep puff your eyes I also
like doing this before I put on my
makeup it's a really great
and also I would like to give myself
like a little massage I mean I'll rub
this all over my eyes and on my eyelids
sometimes I like rub my temples because
they normally give you like a face
massage and like a real spa you want to
do that too then I'm gonna move on to my
lips I'm gonna do like a little lip
scrub this is the honey lip scrub from
lush these taste amazing you don't even
really have to remove them just scrub it
on and then just eat it off like they
seriously taste so good and they're
edible they're all-natural product and
then also from abour I'm using their
chapstick I just like it because it has
cute packaging okay it shows a regular
chapstick but you could just put
whatever chapstick you want on and then
lastly to finish a spray this sprays
from soap &amp;amp; Glory just go get it just
buy it it's amazing I can't I could talk
for hours about how amazing this spray
is I'm looking in the description
because I want you to be blessed but
here is a sort of after of what my skin
looks like super glowy super radiant and
it looks amazing I hope you guys enjoyed
