doing something a little bit different
but I'm really excited I thought I'd try
something new so I was inspired by my
mother not my birth mother my actual
mother jennamarbles not only does she do
whatever she wants on her channel but
she's a self learner you know she likes
to do things for the first time on
camera and I admired that so I've been
wanting to learn something new so I
thought let's do it on camera I thought
it would just be you know a fun time to
do with you guys there are these very
satisfying videos on Instagram of
calligraphy where it's like people
writing very beautifully with like very
ancient pens I wanted to learn how to do
that and now that it's trendy places
like anthropology some kids for it so I
got this kit I don't know how hard this
is gonna be but I have really bad
handwriting like my handwriting is so
bad I can't even read it most of the
time so so I have a basketball game
tomorrow and I thought I would write
formal so I have a basketball game
tomorrow and I thought I would write
formal letters inviting all of my
friends and family to come on down don't
worry I know you can't see the Tim right
now but I have a second camera angle for
you so you can see me okay so there's a
very whoa very thick we have a very
thick instruction loops and squiggles we
get to do both today I'm so excited
we're gonna we're gonna do it all today
loops and squiggles we have like a bunch
of sheets of parchment paper which I
don't really know what that's supposed
to be for can you see it we have our
quill pen look at that look at that
beauty I guess these are what we're
going to be writing on do I have to read
all of that I don't think we do okay
holding the pen do you have to hold it
differently
okay yeah just you hold it like a
regular pen but they had to explain that
in a whole page wiggle the nib okay wait
we what double check to ensure that the
nib does not wiggle before dipping it
into the ink no I'm so scared
wait okay so they just said to do the
tip so that's what I did I think I did
that right I'm gonna practice on the the
thing first
Oh oh my god this is like using a normal
pen I thought it like did something
weird my stars look exactly like their
stars oh there we go
that still looks ugly what your hand
muscle no are you kidding me right now
we're gonna do an upper case in a lower
case a breathe we can do this breathe if
we're just writing an A
perfect you got to make the Boop sound
otherwise it doesn't work
that looks beautiful it's a little
monkey it's a little wonky but it's okay
look at that B that's possible that
looks beautiful it looks beautiful it
looks so good it looks beautiful I still
have you right now it looks so good the
letter C that is all the way to C that
was going an L but we go and do it
anyways we're just we're just gonna move
right on we're gonna go into writing the
letters okay
from tray
my letters are coming out too big that I
don't have enough space to write
basketball um so I'm gonna start over
that looks so good
okay so I just discovered that you can
put the example letters under the
parchment paper and trace over it I'm so
stupid
okay I've done it I finished my first
official letter work tomorrow's a little
janky not gonna lie um but you know
what's our first first one okay why why
why do I keep getting every why next
we're gonna make the invite for my dad
dear Queen
today is just a good day I mastered
another yet another Talent my mom's
bringing me home California Pizza
Kitchen now I have letters for all of my
friends literally just my mom and dad
Wow time check I want to let you guys
know that it's been about a solid half
an hour it's been about it's been about
a half an hour I'm still again trying to
restart the one for my dad because I
keep messing up so what I found to be
the most successful and helpful is I
ditched everything the book told me to
do and I'm just kind of like writing and
cursive almost just adding a little like
swirlies at the end of every letter and
it looks great you know I did it I
finished it I'm so happy we have my two
letters what I did oh the parchment and
then what I did on here hi thank you for
calling me back
oh when you want me write to a letter
about I need to write something hi miss
friend-zoned is that one word or two
words there we go
you girls slept I'm ready to take a nap
who knew writing could be so tiring that
was fun I am so happy I'm so excited got
the side of my belt I've conquered it
and I can tell people I've done it
these looks great I can't wait to
surprise my parents when they come home
