guys that are perfect for both fall and
going back to school I graduated and I
was home-schooled so I have no clue
really about dress codes so I tried my
best to follow dress codes so that you
guys can wear these to school we're all
super comfy laid-back sort of chill
outfits nothing too extra but you're
also gonna stay on trend and look really
stylish at the same time so this first
outfit is just a high-waisted light blue
pair of mom jeans they're a little bit
frayed at the bottom for the t-shirt I
just have a white graphic t-shirt you
could wear any one that you have mine is
from Urban Outfitters though it just
says nonsense on the front and the back
and I tied it in a little knot to
accessorize the look I have some gold
jewelry as rings necklaces little hoops
my little Kelsey necklace I got from
Amazon and I mean jewelry just picks up
an outfit so much you could be wearing
the most simple thing like I'm seriously
just wearing plain jeans and a white
t-shirt but it makes it look so much
more put together for shoes I'm just
wearing white vans and honestly I even
know I have those days when jeans are
too much to put on so you could also
wear the same look with sweatpants my
sweatpants are just from forever 21
they're so comfortable and honestly just
who doesn't love wearing sweatpants so
for my second outfit this by far is the
comfiest coziest outfit I've ever worn
before I have these ribbed super flowy
white pants they're so soft I got them
from Zara when I was in New York again
you don't have to get the same ones as
me if I can find any ones that look like
this I'll try to link them below but I
love these pants I paired them with a
matching white just oversized cozy
sweater it's from H&amp;amp;M it says get off my
back and little red letters on the back
it gives a nice little pop and then for
my shoes I'm just wearing my black furry
slides but if you can't wear slides in
school honestly you can just wear any
sort of like slip on sort of sneaker or
shoe with this you can customize it make
it your own again just use my outfits as
inspiration you don't have to wear the
exact stuff for the third outfit I have
this straight neckline a black tank top
bodysuit and I know it's really stupid
but you can't apparently wear tank tops
in school so on top of this I threw a
really furry just off-white duster with
this this is the one that I got in Zara
I've talked about in videos before and I
love it it's so just slinky and cozy
this is something great to bring to
school if it's cold you could just like
wrap yourself up in it kind of like
you're in a little blanket and it's just
so comfortable it has pockets and a hood
underneath with this I wore Levi's
shorts but they're really long pairs
almost like capris so they definitely go
with the like finger rule if schools
still following with hat and for my
shoes I have my white snakeskin print
slip-ons these are so comfortable I can
just walk around in these all day and
again for accessories I layered a couple
of gold chokers I have some gold rings
and a mini gold hoops on it's a no
effort look that's still comfy but you
look super cute at the same time and the
next look is one of my personal faves
I'm wearing my stadium tour Justin
Bieber merch it's just like a white
long-sleeve shirt it says team Bieber on
the sleeves and on the front and then
the back has like a picture of him with
like a moped it's really cool but I'm
wearing that with my black mom jeans
that I have rolled up I'm wearing that
with of course my same jewelry I kind of
kept it the same throughout all the
looks and I added my mini black vintage
frames to this for my shoes I'm wearing
my white vans and I paired those with
some white crew socks I really like the
combination I like the way it looked but
this is a super chill just relaxed comfy
outfit I would just wear this kind of
any day and it's perfect for the Fall
it'll keep you warm and you can rep
Justin at the same exact time a link
where I got the shirt and obviously
everything else below but this shirt I
found on like some random page so all of
the links to all the clothes will be in
the description below for the next
outfit this is probably the most like
simple outfit it's literally a
sweatshirt some leggings a pair of vans
in a denim jacket I added the genom
jacket just to add a little bit of style
but of course you don't have to have one
I mean anytime you just wear a
sweatshirt and leggings you're gonna be
comfortable if it's for school I do
think you're supposed to wear like
sweatshirts that are a little bit longer
you know when you're wearing leggings of
course you can do that my sweatshirt
just happened to be like a little bit
smaller but my white sweat shirts from
Urban Outfitters my denim jackets from
Zara and then I'm just wearing the
classic skate Provins I think that's
what they're called but I love the
combination of wearing the denim jacket
over the hoodie I think it'll keep you a
really warm
I added some sunglasses with this but
you can honestly wear any jacket like
you could do like a bomber jacket an
army jacket whatever sort of jacket you
have would look really cute over just
sort of like a plain sweatshirt and the
last outfit that I have is probably the
truest one even though you still feel
like you're wearing pajamas it's so
comfortable these pants I picked up from
Urban Outfitters they're just these like
raped flowy ribbed pants that honestly
feel like pj pants like they're so
comfortable and then i'm wearing the
same white snakeskin print slides that i
was wearing the other outfit and for my
top I just have a long-sleeve black rib
top tucked into the pants and then I'm
wearing some sunglasses with that just
to accessorize it this one's probably
like the most put together out of all of
the looks so I do hope that you guys
enjoyed all these looks I hope that you
guys can just rock these throughout the
fall or school and get some inspiration
