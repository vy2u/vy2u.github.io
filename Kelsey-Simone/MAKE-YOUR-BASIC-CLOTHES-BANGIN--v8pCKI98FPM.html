channel today and having a very sick day
which is kind of wild so you know I was
sitting around thinking what am I gonna
film for this Friday I don't feel good
so I don't want to get dressed because
you know for a video I still have to
look cute and I just don't feel like
doing that and then it hit me
I put together a couple of outfits to go
along with a couple of tips that I have
it so that you can wear your most casual
clothes like sweatshirts sweatpants
plain white t-shirts and still look
trendy and fashion-forward at the same
time so I hope this video will be
helpful to some of you guys especially
if you're feeling sick like me I hope
this video can help you feel better so
tip number one that I have for you guys
is to add an eye-catching piece to your
outfit now this can either be something
printed something with a pop of color
from my outfit that I have I just have
this plain just sort of white t-shirt
from brandy Melville and I paired it
with a printed pant you need an
eye-catching piece for extra spiciness
now having this sort of eye catching
piece in your outfit makes people think
there's no way she could have just threw
that on you know I could have styled the
white t-shirt with a pair of leggings
but it wouldn't have looked that
interesting or that special and the
pants that I have with this shirt are
also very comfortable they're made of
like a thinner flowy fabric so it still
feels like you're wearing pajama pants
it does look like you put a lot more
effort into your outfit when you have
that sort of daring and out-of-the-box
piece that makes the outfit look less
basic and like I said it doesn't have to
be pants it could be any piece in your
outfit just as long as you have that
piece it definitely gives a bump up to
your outfit another tip that I have
which is sometimes harder to follow is
to wear a dressier shoe not necessarily
a heel but a heel most likely I've worn
this outfit again I've gone for this
look multiple times we're all just wear
a big baggy sweatshirt with some cute
jeans underneath and then a pair of
heels you know I'm still comfortable
because I'm wearing my sweatshirt that
I've probably slept in I just threw on
my comfiest pair of jeans and then I put
heels on and it looks like a whole cute
out I don't remember who it was but once
I saw the idea of like heels with a
sweatshirt I didn't even know you could
do that I thought it was the coolest
thing ever it doesn't have to be a
stiletto you know it can be a pair of
heeled boots it can be even just a
dressier shoe as long as it's not your
dingy sneakers or a pair of you know
slides just a dressier shoe will make
the outfit look a lot more put together
shoes are very very vital and important
in fashion a shooting make or break your
outfit that is the number one rule I go
by would getting dress is your shoes can
make or break your outfit I've
definitely talked about this in a video
before because it's so important
accessorize you can take the most simple
basic thing ever and make it look like a
billion dollar outfit with accessories
for this outfit I just have a pair of
sweatpants with a black tank top the
most simple as simple can get now my
sweatpants do have a little snag cuz
they're from I'm gso they're really cool
but I mean you can do the same thing
we've just played in sweatpants and it
would be fine there's many options when
it comes to accessories layering
necklaces layering and stacking your
ring you're not like I right now some
really cool out there earrings and I
have a couple piercings so I can like
layer earring you can go for bracelets
sunglasses are always and forever an
accessory I love to use you can
accessorize with hats your bag is always
an accessory you can use so many
different things as accessories to bump
up your outfit and make it look like you
really put in that time to have that
grand outfit but little do people know
is that you're wearing sweat pants and a
tank top
accessories to me give that put together
model off-duty
look that everybody loves these days so
I think it's a great thing I pull it all
the time like I said right now I put on
this sweatshirt and I was like not that
interesting let me put on some big
earrings and I'll put a couple rings on
we're good to go it looks like an outfit
now you know next tip is a tip that I
also love to use and it's to match your
colors matching sets are a big trend
right now so a lot of the times if I'm
just wanting to wear sweats I'll most
likely wear a sweatshirt and sweatpants
that not even necessarily go together
because I know
do make some that go together but that
are just the same color so that it looks
like a set this is like my number one
thing when I go to the airport this is
what I'm wearing when I go to the
airport
it's just a matching sweat suit because
it's comfortable it's warm and cozy man
but you look cute at the same time like
you look so cute in a matching little
set it's adorable next tip is layering
this is a tip that my mom has always
taught me at when I am just looking very
basic I'm wearing you know just like a
simple piece like let's say a t-shirt
dress which is a great example for this
idea
you can layer something on top of it
which I feel like number one this works
amazing when it's cold outside because
you kind of have to layer up anyways so
on top of my t-shirt dress I layer just
sort of an over shirt or you can even
layer a flannel and then a cute jacket
goal is we're trying to get our outfit
as far from basic and just pj looking
light as possible to making it look like
we haven't put together outfits so if
I'm just gonna wear a plain t-shirt
dress I'm gonna throw something on top
of it with a cool pair of shoes like I
said again an eye-catching sort of thing
or maybe wearing like a cool hat with
and yeah it just makes your outfit look
so much better it makes it look a lot
cooler and more interesting that's what
we're trying to do is add interest into
the outfit so those are all of the tips
that I have for you guys I hope that
this was helpful and informative to you
I hope you can use these tips and still
look good and stay cozy my friends
