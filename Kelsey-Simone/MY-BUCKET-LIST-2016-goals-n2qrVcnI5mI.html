first view of 2016 and an oversized
sweatshirt messy bun looking like a
homeless person so Jen guys I will be
filming a video I mean obviously I
really feel like I need a input my look
should I wear these I don't know if I'm
gonna look cute or crazy sure we're
going to go with it I'm going to be
doing a on like a bucket list sort of
video or like a 2015 2015 2016 new
year's resolution kind of thing so on my
phone I just have 10 basic like goals of
things that I want to accomplish this
year um that I'm just going to be
talking to you guys about okay so
starting with thing number one that I
wanted to accomplish this year um
actually let me tell you about this so
last year in October I was at 8,000 or
8k subscribers and I actually have a
little book where I write down my goals
for my youtube channel whether it's
subscriber balanced view amounts videos
I want to get done on things like that
and I actually wrote down that by
October of 2016 this year I wanted to
reach 25k subscribers which is crazy
because I literally passed that like two
weeks ago
simple by the way I just want to say
thank you so much for helping me
accomplish that um and also the
believers thank you believers because
wow you you guys are extra um so
basically my goal for 2016 is to reach
50k subscribers if that's possible we'll
see I didn't even think 25k was possible
but here we are at what is it now I
think 27 right now not sure but yeah I'm
not a specific month just at least in
2016 hopefully I can get to that amount
um goal number 2 for 2016 would be to
get my license so basically um I really
want to get my license specifically
before the summer time because in the
summer I want to be able to like take
road trips and visit Rachel without
having to make like all these
arrangements
their parents and having to check with
my mom for Kela the mall or before I can
do basically anything um so I really
want to get it before the summer time um
number three is to be able to travel
somewhere and buy travel somewhere I
mean somewhere at least like six hours
away from my house
the only time I've been out of the
country was to Canada and I was four and
I don't even remember it well I want to
go to California this summer hopefully
maybe take a vacation somewhere do some
cool spring break I don't know we'll see
where life takes us number four is to
meet new people and make new friends
um that's one of my favorite things to
do I love meeting new people um right
now I don't have like a tight squad my
squad right now is like me Rachael my
mom in Jesus which is probably the bomb
is freaking lit squad you could ever
have
I just want to branch out you know make
new friends meet new people hopefully
people with same interest as me
hopefully meet some youtubers that'd be
really cool um maybe some fashion
bloggers I don't know just meet tons of
new people different places have fun and
yeah make some new friends 2015 2016
number five for 2016 goals would be to
put out weekly videos and oh my gosh I'm
so bad at that I literally these are so
foggy I can't even see I want to start
posting videos weekly because I'm really
bad at that as you can tell my last
video was posted like two weeks ago
sorry about that by the way so yeah
that's been my goal probably since the
summer of last year is to be able to get
my life to a point where I'm so
organized and I don't procrastinate that
I can post on a specific date every week
that was actually my new year's
resolution was to be more organized by
the way and number six is also kind of
related to that is where I wanted to
start blogging I've literally talked
about this I don't know how many times I
don't even know if you guys know that I
have a blog hey what's up I have a blog
um it's always in the link of my
description and I never post on it and
when I do it's it's tragic
so I got this like idea right I was on
Instagram stalking and I got this a
grand idea out of nowhere to do an
outfit of the day almost every day
my blog because sometimes I wear really
cute things just saying and um I always
think to myself like I wish I just
posted my outfits more like I want to be
able to say like yo hey I'm Kelsey I'm a
fashion blogger and I be you know what
I'm saying
probably not so I just want to be able
to do that and then keep up with it
because I'm bad with like starting
things and keeping up with it um so I
also recently just downloaded an app
onto my phone the bloggers like Google
app everybody probably has it but I'm
just now getting onto this so basically
they can blog straight from my phone so
I want to be able to like take a picture
of my outfit almost every day excited
get dressed every day I mean I'm not
naked but I just don't get dressed every
day and a snap cute picture of my outfit
edit it and post it straight to my blog
it's it's gonna be poppin guys number
seven right this is the 7 sep 7 7 7 is
to grow my hair out right now my hair's
short it's like about collarbone length
which is pretty cute but I love long
hair especially on me I have extensions
right now if you guys you can call me
down below if you want a video on my
extensions how I style them what
extensions I use about my extensions
what it's like I use clip-ins by the way
but um yeah I have extensions for those
days they miss my long hair and my goal
is to get my ear to at least like boob
length kind of awkward do that inversion
method thing if you guys know what that
is we like flip your head upside down
and like massage your scalp like 5
minutes every day um so hopefully I can
keep that up and hopefully grow my hair
pretty long number eight um this is kind
of like over your thing but I've been
wanting to do this for a while is
honestly don't even know what it's
called to like okay what I wrote down on
my phone was to host a confidence
sleepover party you're like what's that
you might not even care um but I'm gonna
talk about it anyways so um why don't
you my hosting a confidence party is um
I like to talk I don't know if you guys
can tell by now
I like to teach I love helping girls and
I just have this sort of like passion
for talking about self-confidence and
self-worth because of things that I have
been through my life I feel like I know
I just got some good words to say and I
definitely have always had this like
vision of inviting every girl in my
youth group all my girls I know well my
friends have them my friends bring
friends like literally had a huge party
at my house um talk about tons of things
and boost girls confidence like teach
how I got confidence what confidence
really is the difference between cocky
and confident not like a whole feminist
outrage thing but um showing the girls
that it's kind of like okay to love
yourself you know and like have like
talks about girls let them rant about
their boy problems and all of us can
listen because I know that's very
important to have people listen to you
um give each other in makeovers you know
have like a little like put on some
Beyonce um we can eat pizza like I've
always wanted to do that and I feel like
I definitely should do that and I really
really want to so sometime this year
hopefully I will be able to actually get
my stuff together and hopefully play in
one of those number nine number nine
okay so I don't know if you guys watched
the Cosmopolitan's snapchat stories but
they did this thing they started a
couple days ago where they did like that
28-day Squatch oh sorry I keep like
looking over there where they did this
28-day squat challenge and I really want
to do it like everyday I've been like
screenshotting like what they are and I
really wanted since last year to like

don't really need to work out and really
desire to work out but I do want to get
squats I want to do squats I want to
start doing squats you know life goals
and lastly least but not last but not
least that's it ten go oh I literally
didn't even know what that said I'm so
bad at typing go to an event I wrote
even not I didn't even write about go to
an event like New York Fashion Week or
beautycon or VidCon I always thought
those are so much fun that kind of like
ties in with meeting new people and
making new friends
um but I really want to go to York
Fashion Week or VidCon whether I'm going
as a youtuber or like a fashion blogger
or if I just go just to like enjoy it
who knows like what will happen this
year but um yeah I really want to go to
those because they seem so much fun and
it they just seem awesome and I really
want to go New York Fashion Week New

literally all the time and I think
VidCon is in California but then again
