a favorites video for you guys this
favorites video is going to be a little
bit different than like my typical
favorites video just because it's not
really related to like makeup or fashion
like it normally is this is gonna be
more like personal random stuff this is
just yeah some pretty random stuff that
I like
so the first thing that I've been liking
is this book and I'm obsessed with this
book like one of those like anti-stress
therapeutic drawing book normally when
you see these books they're sort of like
themed and this is like all flowers and
like roses these are like what they look
like
it's like a really pretty book like it's
so pretty like it just sort of is like
framed some of them are circles some of
them are squares but and then down here
it says like all the different types of
flowers that are like in the picture I'm
obsessed with it I think it's like the
cutest thing ever she's something I'm
really like doing I'm like my freetime
it's like sometimes all for a time and
I'll just be so bored and I'm like what
do I even do with my life like I don't
know it is honestly like a really
calming and like I just I like it's fun
okay the next thing I have is a really
good gift I have this pure you might
have seen this in my room tour if you
didn't see my room tour go check it out
but this is my last room tour I normally
have it set like on my bedside table
there but this is a like aromatherapy
oil dispenser room goody smelly thingy
you just fill the top of it with water
and essential oils and then you plug it
in and it just sort of steams up and it
makes your room smells so good it turns
your room into a spa I mean the spa that
I go to has these in like the rooms
where you like get massages and facials
and stuff so I think it's like really
cool so like have it in my room it's
just like and really relaxing and I love
it and then I have like a bunch of like
oils for it I have this one that's
supposed to like help you sleep better
this one's like a distressing one use
this one all the time
this is a headache one and then this one
just like lavender scented it says on
the box to put like four to five drops
I honestly put like 13 drops so the next
thing that I have is also a really good
gift idea this I actually asked for for
Christmas ended up buying it for myself
obviously before Christmas just because
I really wanted it so they are these
rhinestone blinged out
I'm really obsessed with them I think
they're so cute like how extra are these
I mean I feel like headphones or
something like anybody uses and
everybody would need I love blinged out
things I don't know what it is but
blinged out anything is so cool and I
don't know why I never thought of like a
blinged-out headphones but they sell
them on Urban Outfitters so that's where
I got these and I'm pretty sure they
come in like other colors too like
extends these are the skinny-dip
headphones if you wanted to like no I'll
probably like link all this stuff below
if you want to get it but yeah they're
really comfortable neighbor really good
sound like literally obsessed with these
so the next thing I have you also saw
this on my snapchat story but I really
like a genuinely like a product like I
talked about it a lot so this is that
Salt's I don't know if the good stuff is
the brand I don't know but this is just
like a lavender sort of spa bath salt it
smells it smells like a spa it's so just
calming and just like after a really
stressful day I struggle these at the
bottom of the bathtub and it makes the
bath smell so good and it just makes it
more relaxing so it like it looks cute
in my bathroom too so that's plus
soaking in these and it's it's great so
then I have some candles which are also
a really great gift because literally
everybody likes candle the thing is like
I normally will buy candles based off of
how cute they are rather than like how
good they smell don't judge me I have an
aesthetic these ones like it's the best
of both worlds it's like they smell
really really good and they're so cute
the first one the white one is paper
white and musk which I have like the big
one over there there's big ones and
small ones this one just smells like
really fresh and clean I have this black
one which is black rose and food it's
probably not food I said it would like
it's a Doctor Who character like a light
version of Hollister but like it like a
cute boy in the wintertime yeah then I
have this gray one which is smoked birch
and myrrh and ooh this one smells like
like a house like at Christmas time that
has like the fireplace on mmm because
it's wintertime and it's sort of colder
season everybody is you know bringing
out the Christmas socks they're all
in green but I want to wear comfy
Christmas songs but so I went to Urban
Outfitters and I got these socks and
I've been obsessed with them I have a
black pair and I have a white pair so
these are just like really long furry
socks and they're obviously the most
comfortable socks I've ever worn in my
life I originally got these two like
whereas like fashion wise like
underneath like my low top vans or
something but they're so comfortable and
I just lounge around in these like all
the time then I have like a really
random favorite it's a bag of chips but
it's my favorite packages I tweeted
about these and snapchat about these a
couple times so you guys already know
it's basically just like a potato chip
covered in Old Bay seasoning but it
tastes so good first time this summer I
had like crabs you know covered in Old
Bay when I went to my friend's beach
house and it was so good and this just
kind of like reminds me of that and it's
just like tastes like summer on the boat
the last thing I have is um oh this is
one of my favorites too so you have my
laptop avid um skins from unique fine to
even have it on my phone I have like a
white grid print one on my phone and
then I have this like black marble one
on my laptop I'll link them down below
as well it's basically like a sticker so
you don't really need like a case it's
just like a sticker that goes on and it
doesn't leave like a residue or anything
but I want to talk about my spot buy
because I get so many questions about my
Spotify I'm always talking about how
cool it is honestly I don't really use
it that much like I don't have all my
favorite music on it I have like a
couple playlists but I don't really
update it that often but I mean if you
guys I still like use it so if you guys
want to listen to it I have one I'll put
it like right here or something it's
just rosy cheeks and freckles um those
