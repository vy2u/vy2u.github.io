an evening routine this is kind of like
a mix of videos it's like a skincare
routine a shower routine and a haircare
routine so you get a lot of you know
personal info about me today how fun
starting off my evening I'll come home
from whatever I was doing that day I
actually filmed this video in the
morning from Zach so I could have good
lighting so I literally was doing
nothing before this but normally what I
do when I get home from whatever is I
like to get on my phone check social
media I'll go on my laptop
I'll check youtube videos and I'll
normally edit a video like I'm doing
right now I will film something but I
was currently doing that's obviously I
didn't need to film but I'll just sort
of do you know internet stuff basic
teams check my IG you know update my
blog by the way all my links will be
down below so go make sure to check them
out and follow me then I'm going to head
into the bathroom and change out of
whatever I was wearing that day if you
guys have seen my other afternoon
routines you guys know I love robes and
I got this one for Christmas so I was
wearing it cuz I'm obsessed with it so I
like to look and appreciate the glam
that I had on that day before I said
goodbye and wash my face off I'm going
to be using a regular old makeup wipe to
remove my makeup because I'm really lazy
and I just like using makeup wipes but
don't get me wrong I do wash my face
washing your face is really important I
do that right after this but just to get
my makeup off I like to use wipes and
then I'm going to go ahead and throw my
hair up in a bun because I hate having
my hair done washing my face when it
gets all wet and sticks to your face
deal anyways moving on to the actual
skincare part I'm going to be washing my
face with this pixie Glo mud cleanser I
recently discovered this I was randomly
you know walking around the beauty
section saw this and was like whoa
that's cool let's try it and I've been
loving it it leaves my skin so super
soft after using it so I just kind of
mix it with some water rub it on your
face and it gets your face squeaky-clean
I also love playing with my eyebrows you
know just just a fun hobby of mine so
pat your face dry rinse that all off and
then I'm going to be toning which is
something I've never done before but I
bought this fresh rose facial toner and
it's a Miss and you guys know that I
love rose onto things and Miss so it
makes toning easy look how much I put on
the yes the toning
and then I moved to moisturizer I take
moisturizer very seriously
and pretty much religiously I used
moisturizer twice today because I've
really dry skin this is the fresh youth
preserve cream I just noticed I used two
fresh products in a row I'm not
sponsored guys they should have really
good products I really like this
moisturizer so I go ahead and rub it
into my face and I'm very aware that my
face is lighter than my neck I fake tan
and I don't like putting fake tan on my
face just FYI then I like to moisturize
my lips I use this milk hydrating oil
stick it's the bomb I love using it so I
just put it all over my lips because you
know wintertime and then get my Mario
Badescu rosewater facial spray this is
pretty much in every single video of
mine I'm obsessed cuz it's sprite
everywhere go ahead even in your hair
why not next I'm going to go ahead and
take a shower and it look how
aesthetically pleasing did I do this
entire video just to show you the new
bathroom renovation maybe but moving on
to what I use in the shower I have the
dynamic duo for my hair this has changed
my hair's life again not sponsored just
obsessed with this product this is the
og X I pretty sure that's just how you
say it nourishing coconut milk shampoo
and conditioner bless this product
please go buy it if you have curly
frizzy just dry damaged hair it did
wonders oh and that's my body wash it's
just peach and honey scented smells
amazing now I'm too haircare after the
shower I like to spray some coconut oil
in my hair this is actually token of
water by the same brand I have tons of
their hair care products they're amazing
but I just spritz this in the ends of my
hair and just sort of run it through I
have really curly hair so this helps
when it dries it doesn't get as frizzy
and it makes my hair smell so amazing I
love coconut scented stuff if you can't
tell and then I use this away a
finishing cream this also just sort of
helps my curls to calm down so that
they're not like so like you know
everywhere once it dries they're just
sort of like a little bit you know tamed
them down a little bit I really like the
look that it just gives my curls once
you know my hair dried so I just sort of
run that through I'll scrunch it a
little bit even put it in the roots if
you want go ahead do whatever you want
girly but yes so I hope this product
also smells really amazing too so yeah
that's pretty much it for my haircare
after that I'll go ahead sit on my bed
chill and relax I like to do devotion
time you know put the worship playlist
on link will be in the bio
read some scriptures but yeah that is
pretty much my evening routine I hope
