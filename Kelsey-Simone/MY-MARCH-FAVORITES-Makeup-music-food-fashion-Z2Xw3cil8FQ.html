know the intro classy hello everybody
today we are back on my bed with some of
my favorite things I believe I have a
lot of new favorite stuff to show you
guys that I've been like really loving
lately I have like a makeup product a
fashion thing of skincare two randoms a
food of music so we have a lot of
different stuff to talk about so I'm
going to do my makeup favorite frisk so
we have one this is the milk makeup it's
like a stick highlighter the whole main
outcoming goal of my makeup is a world
of buttered I want to look super glowy
like a little butter breakfast sausage
so I love the fact that of the stick you
sort of go like that all over your baby
is amazing like me this is perfect you
just friend you're not
it's a beautiful champagne look at that
this is in the shade licks while the
hips kiss me and call it it's my
favorite right now milk packaging is
super cute this is my go-to like always
like throw that on buttered done ready
to go got around the toast ready to go
I'm mitosis the butter that was eat that
was the analogy it's in the next sort of
thing that I have full wood thank you
this is my new camera as you guys saw my
last video was a vlog on because I got
news well camera this is the canon
powershot g7x it has a slippy thing I
love the slippy thing and it's also a
touchscreen flippy thing how cool is
that
so basically to focus the camera like if
it's like not so get you just like tap
or you want to focus and I love this
love the feature you can change all the
settings on here the iOS the exposure
everything right from the screen it's
very very easy to use so if you're a
beginner if you're starting YouTube
channel or sharing the vlog channel
highly recommend this camera just see
yourself a few cameras I think
hello so yeah you guys really liked it
the last vlog so definitely be expecting
more vlog students per fashion I've been
obsessed with oversized videos oversight
entities are taking out my closet I love
going to the men's section looking on a
little asian getting them all and like I
like them oversized when I can wear them
like a dress like that should like my
office lately is be they're like
oversized
studies as dresses with like really cute
Lakefield boots or just like them this
is my newest one you guys saw this this
one's from the hmm section it's got like
a little rose on the hood super Feud
I've been sort of getting into like
muted tone colors because as you guys
know I literally wear no colors I've
been getting into these like muted sort
of tones that I really like it's like
color but like in the his sort of way
and I'll wear them just like those with
like a bunch of chokers and just like
really cute like platform heeled boots
or something and I love anything with a
hood on it I can just like go in here
this is actually really comfy I might
keep this hun okay this next favorite
and very near and dear to my heart
literally after this video I have plans
to go buy more so I recently got
obsessed with the pixi skincare line so
I got only three things but they have so
much more so you guys know I love facial
mist and so this is the hydrating milky
mist which I have come fighting this but
naumann and milky so it's like okay
there's like a very fresh clean sort of
smell
by the way their packaging can we talk
about it this is so cute who knew I
would ever look at green packaging but
it's sort of just like this rose gold
green and white packaging I can't get
over it I love it so this is the h2o
skin drink this is one of their
moisturizers but this is basically a
hydration gel so it's not like a typical
like lotion sort of formula and the
second you start blending it in it like
turns into water which is so cool it
smells and it tastes good you guys know
I always taste my skincare products as
it's weird okay normally when I
moisturize my face
I like run it over my lips shall we
hydrate my lips as well I just like to
lick my lips and it tastes so good it
tastes like fruit loops like it smells
like fruit loops I have a ton of toners
that I haven't gone through yet the lady
was just giving out these like travel
little sample sizes this is their glow
tonic toner and as you can see I
literally almost done it it's down there
it's so nice it has like a really floral
smell to it which I love Nicias your
basic toner really nice even by your
skin tone cleans your skin up so the
next thing that I have is another really
random favorite so they did send this to
this is not sponsored they just happen
to might be locks and I'm like loving it
and I've been using it seriously every
day it's called the happiness Planner
focus on what makes you happy
so um it's like this daily planner it
starts off in the beginning of the
planners it gives you like really
inspirational like quotes throughout the
book and it might ask you all these
questions like Alissa things that make
you happy a list of your strengths and
weaknesses that you want to improve this
year
what are your proud achievement like
what are some lessons you've learned
what if you overcome blah blah blah
really inspirational junk you know at
the beginning of every month it's a big
calendar where you can write things in
so far the only thing I've written down
was that I'm going to write leave house
so then every single day looks like this
there's a quote at the top of every day
which they're all so good it asks you on
each page it's like a really positive
boosting but we I think it's so helpful
for me like I really need that so
basically all the little categories
there's today I'm excited about my main
focus of the day my schedule a checklist
of like to-do list your notes like notes
to yourself good things about today what
you're grateful for and what I hope for
tomorrow like how great is that we get
really get to like thinking and learning
with Outlook what am i thankful for
today like what am I actually excited
about today what makes me happy for
tomorrow like if you need that extra
boost positivity in your life definitely
check out this book like it is so good
organized and positive eyes your life
I'm a little too confident in this video
I'm going to blank it in everything like
I'm just okay so the next favorite that
I have is actually an album so it is the
vessel have it all out of all the songs
on this album are super like calming
chill just like relaxing like if you

so my next favorite well okay this is my
next favorite this has been a favorite
of mine literally forever I don't know
I've never talked about this before but
mochi ice cream I just I just have this
loved ease in my heart for Japanese
culture I really do
mochi ice cream is my favorite probably
going to eat one while I talk about it I
love the flavor of green tea not a lot
of people like green tea like matcha
flavor a lot of my friends say he's like
dirt with like these little jelly balls
filled with ice cream I don't really
know how to describe like the
consistency of it because in America we
