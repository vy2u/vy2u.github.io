champagne glass with the Martinelli the
big drop but they wasn't ready champagne
glass with the fine nose hello everybody
and welcome to my room tour I just flex
a little bit okay I'm gonna be doing the
intro on the mirror because I'm just
gonna make it really quick I'm gonna be
also doing the closet tour um also I'm
gonna apologize for the amount of times
I say the word HomeGoods and IKEA do
have like a couple Christmassy decorated
pieces in here
but it's not like Christmas rooms let's
just get started so I'm gonna show up
with my closet because right when you
walk into my door is the closet so this
is my closet I love my closet now I used
to never show it because I didn't like
it um it was completely different before
we had to get it all out we built this
wall this back wall here wasn't even a
while before and then we installed all
this storage which all of this is the
alga system from Ikea so on the right
over here we have these three shelves I
have all my blue jeans folded on the top
black jeans white jeans I only have two
pairs pants and then like my nicer
sweatpants I guess just like my Adidas
my Calvin Klein's and like stuff like
that I have my hamper right there which
is also from Ikea and then I just have
like my favorite shoes like lined across
the bottom just like a couple of like my
most warns over here but um then right
here's all of my tops I have like a
couple jackets mixed in between just
like everyday light ones that I just
throw on a lot but mainly this is all my
tops it's all color-coordinated you know
a lot of the comments are gonna be like
oh my god does she wear color no I don't
I have all my black over here and then
it starts with dark grey to light grey
to white to cream to nude so that's
that's the variation of color that we
got here these like a slide out which is
really cool so I have all my skirts on
top black shorts white shorts and my
denim shorts at the bottom and like I
said like a couple more pairs of shoes
the lighting in this section is really
yellow and really bad I know back here I
have this little section I have a white
rug on the floor and then hanging over
here is all of my dresses jackets and
coats so pretty much everything that was
too
long to hang here because it would like
drag on the floor I hung over here so
like I said all my dresses on my like
long trench coats and stuff like that
and then all my shoes I have organized
in this against the wall a cube
organizer that I got from Target I have
a lot of shoes so they're really hard to
organize I thought this was the best way
to do it there's a lot of shoes that go
back there I wanted to start making use
of like the side wall so I hung up like
my furry socks and like my little like
rhinestone bralette because I have all
this space to like hang stuff so
probably I'm probably going to start
doing that after my closet is this
little entry section which this same
piece of furniture was here in my past
couple of room tours I just really like
this here I feel like it's a good entry
piece I have this like random bag up
here with like a fur chain and then just
like a little black wallet
I have two pairs of heels here and then
I have these like grey velvet heels from
ego which I'm obsessed with normally
right in the middle shelf I'll put
whatever purse I'm wearing currently

wore it's just one of my shells I have
my Zac Posen with the first strap you

fandom side to me so I buy a lot of

guess you could say I have this chair
which is one of my favorite parts of my
room
this is a chair that was actually
inspired by another chair that I wanted

and then we tore all the cushioning and
all the stuff off of it completely got
new cushions and new boards and then
reupholstered it ourselves they have oh

background for my videos and you
recently it has been so I have two
matching bedside tables which they're
both from Target online I don't know if

they're only on
mind is that in focus no it wasn't I'm
sorry well I got this from The Container
Store I just have these candles in there
they're Bath and Body Works and
