this videos a hot mess but we're gonna
have some fun so I'm really sick but I'm
not going to get into Wix like you guys
probably don't even really care so I am
filming a favorites video talking about
all my favorite stuff because I don't
even honestly remember the last time I
did one like I feel like it was so long
ago in my normal videos I just do like
makeup in fashion trends but like I'm
doing a lot more stuff this time so it's
just kind of like stuff I've been loving
lately you guys by the way I've highly
requested skincare routine so let me
know in the comments if you want one so
this is my first favorite this is the
Josie Maran Argan cleansing oil and oh
my gosh this is like a two-in-one
I sort of use it to wash my face but
also to remove my makeup this stuff is
so much better than like a typical
makeup like face wash because it gets
off like waterproof makeup and stuff
like that um plus the packaging is
really cute I have the box stone because
I'm just weird like that I just feel
like I have been watching my face a lot
more since I started using this I put
like 5 to 6 on pumps of this and put it
on my totally dry face yes your dry face
I really sensitive skin it doesn't burn
me and normally get like soap in my eyes
and it burns because like I really try
to rub my mascara like eyeliner off but
this doesn't burn if it gets in your eye
and I've accidentally not accidentally
but I've tasted it before when washing
my face and it actually doesn't taste
bad
so yeah this stuff is just like really
amazing and it's just it's just
everything so the next thing I have is
this and I recently started getting add
rollerball perfumes I don't know why I
never wore these before I'm that type of
person who literally forgets every
single thing she has to do before she
leaves the house in the morning um so
perfume it is something I normally
always forget to put on unless I'm going
like somewhere fancy and I'm really
getting ready so having a rollerball on
my purse like really helps me this is
Dee Elizabeth and James White like the
Nirvana one it smells so good it's like
a really sophisticated smell which I
love who doesn't want to smell instigate
it and it's really cute I saved the box
as well
again I'm weird like that um they
describe it as a peony musk which really
makes sense and then the other thing I
have that was not skincare it's okay and
then this this stuff is so good let me
tell you right now my mom started using
this and like my mom and I always share
like products and like we always
recommend stuff to each other so this
stuff she started getting and okay what
attracted me to this number one was this
smell I was like what is that smell you
smell so good
and it's this face and body cleanser I
just use it to wash my face though and
it's a really gritty almost so it's kind
of like exfoliate or - it's called let
the good times roll and it is orange
like this and it literally smells like
you're rubbing cake batter on your face
I apparently taste everything it tastes
really good like you're probably not
supposed to eat it but like this is all
natural like vegan stuff so I kind of
don't feel bad it literally has popcorn
in it so it just makes my skin really
really soft freakin amazing
and another favorite I've been loving is
rosewater I don't know why I just like
really rosewater in coconut water like I
love those are my favorite scents um so
I - this is for your face this is for
your hair I learned hard way that
there's a very big difference between a
hair and facials right so this rose
water is from herbivore I got this at
Urban Outfitters and it's just like hair
perfume and then this one's the Mario
Badescu facial spray on this one I also
get an Urban Outfitters you can get it
at Sephora too but they're really
inexpensive and I use them all the time
so then I have some makeup product I
don't have that much makeup actually but
oh my god okay so I was hanging out with
my friend and we were both doing her
makeup and I had like came out of the
bathroom and I looked at her face
and I was like girl like I thought she
had her whole face done I was like what
concealer is that what foundation is
that what highlight is that like what
glow do you have she was like oh all I
have on his primer I was like excuse me
so this is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector she said she used this and
this is in the color opal oh my gosh so
this is like
travel-size what of it there is a bigger
size so this stuff is basically just
like a liquid highlighter that you would
put on under or over your foundation
like whichever one I don't feel like
putting on makeup look I literally just
put this on like as foundation almost
like I just apply this all over my face
it makes your skin look so glowy stuff
is so good so milk is a company I had
some of their skin care products and I
didn't even know they had like a makeup
brand I literally their packaging I
cannot these two products came and like
a bag together so this one first of all
look at back a'junk it's so cute this is
a rose lip balm and I like the way it
smells
again like I love like I said like rose
water and stuff like that but this I
don't know it kind of smells like this
stress relieving aromatherapy that I
have it has like a pink sort of shimmer
to it and it just like smells really
good it just works like a regular lip
balm but like I don't know I just really
like the smell of it and the packaging
is just too cute this was right on my
bedside table because it's so cute look
at it Oh we'll get it over there it's
strong it's tough it just sits there and
looks cute and then this is a mascara
like how cool is that it's got this wand
and it's got these sort of like bubble
shapes on the wand which I've never used
mascara like that and it's really good
going to California soon so I'm glad I
have like all this smaller sized makeup
because I need stuff to travel with and
this is amazing
okay so on to fashion stuff um so these
are a new pair of sunglasses I got so
these are from boohoo I shot with that
and these are just really cute they just
like kind of hide the ugly
I wore these like all day after the
shoot because I actually had like a
really bad infection and I went to
Panera with my mom afterwards so I just
kind of wore these inside everywhere
like the whole rest of the day but like
little did everybody else know my I was
losing so like they come in handy and
they're really stylish and cute I love
like the likes really simple gold
detailing around it so pretty and then
the next thing I have is more of like a
trend than like a specific item because
I have tons of them so it is soaked and
I love silk I think it's just really
really pretty and it's so comfortable
and soft like it feels like you're
wearing
these are PJs but like you look really
cool so anytime I can feel comfortable
but also like a look really cute I'm all
about it I have tons of like button-up
long-sleeve tops I have this white one I
have this like I have this light pink
one I have this black one which I just
got yesterday and they're just so cute I
wear them open with stuff underneath or
I like tie them around or all I keep
them open let's have them around my
waist you can literally do anything with
them and tons of slip dresses is the
black one that I had styled and like an
outfit video a little bit back and then
I have this like Calvin Klein little
tank top one I haven't won yet I think I
went like one picture but it's just like
a gray one and it's so pretty and so
soft then the next thing is also a trend
that I have multiple of its chokers and
but it's like layering chokers I love
layering chokers I so many I have this
like silk like a big thick one this
one's DIY it's literally just silk like
fabric that I just cut um I have this
fir one that is also DIY I just got some
like white fur the craft store like
cutting into a choker and then this
one's from boohoo it's just velvet it
goes around like this one from boohoo
it's just white tab this little like
silver chain one that's really cute I
got these at Nordstrom Rack and like
they're totally not chokers but like who
cares nobody's gonna tell and like if
you can tell like you wouldn't care so I
have a silver and a gold one because
they came in a 2-pack so whatever I'm
feeling that day and they're headbands
but like they fit perfectly finally
chokers and then of these I love cord
string chokers these you are can
literally DIY yourself this is just
soaked string that I just cut and I cut
it a little longer wrap around thing and
then I have this one that's like really
really long so I can like wrap it around
a bunch and like tie it then I have
these which were threated and then di
wide and it's gonna sound so ugly I'll
put some inspiration picture there with
me high water just like ripped at the
bottom Jean bought these like white
high-waisted like sort of mom jeans and
they fit perfectly
and then I like they weren't skinny and
I like fact that like I like how these
were like flare out and then I like
shredded them at the bottom I'm going to
shred them a little bit more but I think
they're so cute and they're just like
really high-waisted um I can dress these
up and like put these underneath of them
or like totally just wear these with
chucks and do it like super grunge um I
wear them both ways but I think they're
cute um definitely getting out of my
comfort zone with these because I never
ever thought I'd ever say in my life on
camera that in my favorites video that I
like high water jeans but like here we
are um then I have some food um these
were not like planned I just kind of
like saw these on the side my bed
and notice that I fees a lot and I was
like put them on my favorite video I
love barbecue chips um I love barbecue
chips they're really good I crave them
often sometimes multiple times a day um
satisfaction guaranteed totally true and
also hot fries aren't very popular
because I find every time I have a
friend they never know what hot fries
are but they're so good and they're not
that spicy it's kind of like a hot
cheeto to be honest well thank you guys

talked about all my favorite products I
