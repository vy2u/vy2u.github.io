Kelsey so today I'm going to be filming
a favorites for you guys I don't even
remember the last time I did a favorites
but I'm just going to be showing you
some of my favorite stuff I've been
using recently and just like all the
time just like my things I'm obsessed
with can you not do that so the first
thing I've been obsessed with is these
two products I basically just use them
together these are the mac mineralize
skinfinish --is and I have a bronzer one
and then a highlight one the bronzer one
on this is just in the shade dark and
this is like I have two of them but this
is like the non like glitter one on cuz
I like it when they're a lot more matte
its not glittery and shimmery but it's
not like completely matte it has like a
nice luminescence to it so like it still
gives you that sunkissed glow but like
not being like a disco ball and then
this is like the same thing like I like
how much like glow it gives your skin
like it makes your skin look really
really dewy but like you probably can't
even see that but like it's just like
not glittery and they stay on forever
and I'm obsessed with them and yeah I've
been using these a lot lately and the
next thing I've been using a lot is this
matte lipstick
it's the perfect fall color it's called
whirl it's this like dark nude not
really red but it's like mixture of like
nude but it's like a really really warm
cinnamon color I'm like obsessed with it
and I just got it and it's not really
matte it's more of like shiny things
like for some reason I've been getting
into like more like glossy lips I know
like I wear matte like literally all the
time but I've been liking this a lot the
next thing that is my favorite is
actually a lush bath bomb but I used it
already but this is the back edge it was
a nice we're not lying this as you can
see can like there's still crumbs on it
that's kind of weird thing to save it
okay
Oh smells so good it literally smells so
good I have a little video that I took
of it and it's like it's called Dragon's
egg so it's like green and like with
like a hint of like purple so it's kind
of like Barney but like not really
and like with gold glitter in it so yeah
I'm definitely going to be getting like
another one of these because I'm
obsessed it's like my favorite scent
ever and I really wish I had another one
my next favorite that I have is this
right here this little charm so I've
been obsessed with purse charms I know
like the whole like trend first roms is
really popular right now so you guys
have already seen this little fuzzball
I'm pretty sure I think so I have this
little charm here which is actually it
should Nell charm that I took off of my
Chanel purse with like these little
pliers I had and then I attached it onto
here and it looks really cute and I
think they look really really nice
together
and I just think it looks really pretty
with my purse my next favorite was in my
last video I'll link it down below if
you guys want to go see it but I have
the Nike Air Forces and they got kind of
money but I have to wash them but yeah
so they're my night air forces and
they're the low top ones and I've worn
them like literally every single day
since I got them I'm obsessed and
they're just amazing and they go with
everything they're so cute and they're
comfortable and yeah like I said I love
them and I have a whole video basically
I just showed outfits of how I would
style them and just yeah so if you want
to go see that video I'll have a link
down below all my other links will be
down below I linked like my blog and my
tumblr my Instagram all that good stuff
one different that I have that's not
like actually I have it is like my hair
oh yeah by the way my hair I dyed it and
I don't know if you could tell it's like
black now but um I love splitting it
down the middle and took me behind my
ears and bushing it back just like I
know I see a lot of people doing it like
Kylie Jenner does it
kendall Jenner does it both genders you
know it's just like a really popular
hair look that I'm like obsessed with
and I think it looks really cute I just
hate how like sometimes you can see like
the short pieces come up so I might I
was thinking of getting extensions I
don't know but I've been doing this
wearing this all the time and I think it
looks really really pretty so so I have
two fashion favorites um the first thing
I have is this hoodie and can we just
talk about this movie for a second okay
this hoodie I'm literally obsessed with
so it's kind of like a knockoff of like
the Calvin Klein hoodie that Kendall
modeled so it has like the wording
that's like cut off at the bottom and
it's white and
a little hood and it's so cute and I
wear it literally all the time like I
wear it like if I'm exercising like
black leggings or I'll wear it out with
like something really like cute
underneath and some like laced up
booties and like I just wear it all the
time and it's super duper cute and it's
comfortable and it's perfect for the
weather right now it's kind of like that
really awkward weather where it's like
it's hot and you want to wear shorts but
it's like cold and you want to wear a
hoodie so it's like a short sleeve
hoodie which is like perfect for right
now next thing I've been loving these
jeans these are mom jeans and I love mom
jeans these are from the brand New York
jeans I just drifted these when I was
actually with Rachel
like a couple weeks ago and I just roll
them up at the bottom and they're super
duper cute I like to wear them with like
literally everything you can wear the
crop tops you can wear them with hoodies
you can wear them with literally
anything you want to wear and I love
them I love the color of them and the
fade and the wash and I just think
they're really really cute okay so that
was my current favorites it's not like a
fall favorites or like I want our
favorites or anything just right now my
latest obsessions I really hoped you
