vacation morning routine I'll typically
start it off on my phone I'll check my
social medias even take a selfie I
actually took the selfie while filming
this video I normally don't really use
my phone during the day when I'm on
vacation so I take advantage of the
morning and just check everything as
well as have at my breakfast and
normally when I'm on vacation
I'll get room service thanks to my dad
for handing me my stuff but I've started
drinking coffee recently I don't know
what happened to me guys you know I used
to hate coffee but I started doing it
for the aesthetic and then it just sort
of stuck with me so and some bacon and
waffles and then once I was done I
normally head straight to the bathroom
to get ready of course this is going to
be really natural because I don't wear
that much makeup on vacation I was in
Mexico so I was getting you know in the
water a lot so I didn't need a lot of
hair and makeup so starting off with
skincare I used an eye cream which is
really good because I have puffy eyes in
the morning this is the new Dior eye
creme obviously you don't need to use a
Dior eye creme I'm so extra but I
thought it was cool because it comes
with this gold rollerball that's cold
and it just really helps you keep up in
your eyes but use whatever you have and
then I went to moisturizer which i
religiously moisturized like 50 billion
times a day I'm using my fresh vitamin
nectar this has been my favorite
recently they sent this to me and I'm
obsessed with it sort of that all over
my face and down my neck don't forget
your neck that's super important guys
and then after I moisturize I put on
this Giorgio Armani Master UV it's a
face primer but it also protects your
face from the Sun it has SPF 50 in it
and it's really important to wear
sunscreen on vacation please especially
on your face
for makeup it was really simple I went
with my ever forever always my favorite
never use anything else Laura Mercier
illuminated tinted moisturizer I just
put this all over my face to sort of
match my tan to my body and then I put
on some concealer under my eyes and I
had a little bit of sunburn on the top
of my forehead so I just covered up that
redness I was looking like a tomato and
then I did some brow gel my glossy ur
boy brow and then some bronzer because
I'm kind of like a bronze goddess while
on vacation and I left my fake Tanner at
home which sucked so loading up on that
Too Faced chocolate Soleil and then
after that we have my highlighter this
is the Laura Mercier hi
later which is my favorite look at that
glow I really had to break my neck to
show you that highlight but yeah just I
was just sort of putting this all over
my face pretty much setting my face
creases and then I did mascara I was
using brown mascara the roller lash from
benefit because Brown was a little bit
more natural without that tip from one
of my friends and then I went on to lips
I was using this hourglass little chubby
stick I don't know what it's actually
called but it's just this nude color
that's really pretty and then my Dior
maximizer gloss on top of that just to
give a little bit of Sheen because I
love lip gloss right now and yeah just
casually posing on the counter like you
know we all do healthy don't ask I don't
know why I was doing that then I moved
on to my hair taking it out as a bun and
the first thing that I did was I sprayed
some dry shampoo nick who has time to
wash your hair just kidding
I actually washed it the night before I
actually straightened it before this
video that's what my hair looked like
because it was that humid I know insane
then I just put some waves spray and
some hair oil in it to make it look less
frizzy because it was a little frizzy so
the hair will really calms down my frizz
both the waves bright and the hair oil
were from way haircare and I just sort
of toss with my fingers through it play
around with it I just you know embrace
the poof that's that's what you got guys
then I got dressed I'll normally lay out
my outfit because I'm super organized
like that and then sunscreen and SPF
everywhere girl because I burn so easily
I don't know how I don't know I never
get a tan but I will lay out and I will
try so hard to get a tan this is my
outfit I had some Levi's shorts my
little belt is from Free People my
Christian Dior tank top and then I had a
bunch of gold chokers on like when do I
not and then this little had that I
continuously still for my mom because I
haven't bought myself one so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this little morning
vacation routine give it a thumbs up if
you did leave some comments below some
more video requests I love you guys so
much and I'll see in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
