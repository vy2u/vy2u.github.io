show you my morning routine and how I
like to start my day I like to sleep in
over to so of course I start my morning
off with this guy
moisturizer is so important to me I'm
always try to my face like five times a
day see you get this moisturized glow
we're not even wearing highlighter yet
ladies so this is my favorite time of
the day I have my Bible here this is
actually like a girls Study Bible which
is great and then I also have my two
devotional books I just kind of go
through them at random but this is also
where I get all my thoughts together I
write down my video ideas I'll go
through emails I'll do everything sort
of here
so right now I'm making some tea this is
my English breakfast tea I got this so I
was in London I normally don't eat that
much for breakfast just because super
early in the morning I don't get that
hungry and now it's time for me to get
dressed Here I am dressed and well not
ready yet we stuff to do my makeup start
off with a little brightening concealer
this will just sort of give you that
awake look that we don't have right now
I normally don't fill in my eyebrows
anymore I kind of have just been
sticking to just brow gel and then a
little bit of bronzer this is my
favorite right now it's the Sun bunny
one I just swirl the two together
and then I take a little bit I go under
my bottom lip just like that right there
at the tip of the nose that's my
favorite spot to put highlighter just a
baby bit of mascara I get on my bottom
lashes - last but not least setting
spray I'll sort of spread out everywhere
around - why not then also I'll take my
highlighter do a little shoulder action
since we've got our man tank top today I
thought why not we have a second day
curl thing sort of going on so that is
the perfect time to take a little wave
spray just give it a nice little scrunch
and would it even be a Kelsey look
without some accessories
and there we have it this is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
this a morning routine if you did give
it a thumbs up to let me know also don't
forget to subscribe I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in my next video
ma bye good morning my name is Kelsey
cinnamon who do you know here some plugs
Kelsey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
