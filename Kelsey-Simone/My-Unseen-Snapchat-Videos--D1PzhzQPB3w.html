I'm doing a different vibe I guess I
feel like I needed a laugh I feel like
my whole youtube channel in general just
needed a really good laugh so I thought
I would do something a little bit more
personal a little bit more you know
relaxed and chill everybody on YouTube
these days is like reacting to stuff I
thought it would be fun to do like a
little deep dive into my snapchat
memories
obviously this stuff I've never posted
the stuff before it hasn't been on my
story it's either stuff that just gets
sent to my personal friends or stuff
that I'll just save in my memories for
later because it was funny so yeah I
tend to make a lot of really weird
videos and save them to my memories okay
so I'm going to scroll down a little bit
just so that I'm not at the very top
we'll just find some like a random
folder one so I just stop scrolling I
chose this one because I can tell it's
going to be funny because I just need
your cardboard cutouts in it and I tend
to make a lot of funny videos of him so
thankful for that it's such as I said
yeah turn everything you're wishing into
heaven yeah Oh Jesse oh my god Bauer his
face at the end I'm sorry Justin he's
over there nice nice nice nice don't
know what this is
hey Palin wait why wait one that's my
lettuce that's it that's all there is to
the video okay okay I concern myself
like I would get don't know what's going
on
oh honey to be honest when do you not
execute because you extra cute did I
come up about it sounds good wait
execute oh you do have a Twitter tag me
give me credit that was good you know
TMI ago you just thought everything in
my mouth you just thought everything in
my mouth I'm glowing
no oh doesn't a youtube comment okay I
think it's weird the shear value of the
girl avatar from the movie I was okay I
assume weird comments I thought it was
funny to me because I thought they were
talking about like avatar like the blue
Abbott
people souls like why would they compare
me to that but then I thought oh they're
talking about the avatar last airbender
avatar girl and I was like oh I'm just
gonna put my hoodie on
this is gonna give us some protection
from the cringe okay I don't know what
this one is but it looks funny because
delicious I'll just show like oh this
way on this show the thumbnail here is
Jillian all caps just the booger is
video that I found first in front of it
explains why there's a book on my finger
so we'll watch them in order um but it
has my cat in it my cats actually right
here you see his tail he looks like he
wants to kill me
he also looks like he wants to come here
so let's watch this looks fun hit this
yogurt I'm sure I've voice that's why
there was a booger on my finger line you
know I thought it was really funny when
when my lab sounds like that oh my god I
was like dying in this video I don't
know why I found that so amusing not
even uh funny no wonder my friends hate
me so we have this one it's my actual
video editor and it says I'm not putting
the same but so I'm guessing it's
something I obviously cut out of a video
that videos actually still go on my
channel now but that video I filmed that
get ready with my friend and we tried to
film like a bunch of funny stuff cuz we
wanted to put my bloopers at the end of
our videos but every single thing so he
filmed in a big way too weird to put in
a video that maybe this one is the
thumbnail of it I don't know if this is
like I genuinely don't even know what
this is why am I so nauseous oh my god
we're so fucking sick class today
actually I was at a haunted house
somebody farted in Devon mm a church so
it wasn't you in that area died I think
I'm saying to stop yelling at me
does end out protip don't put on fake
Tanner before burrito worship service
this one looks good as title when I
listen to Justin's new song oh no it's
in slow motion
that's how you know it's going to be bad
when I put it in slow motion it's so
gross
so actually what happened in that video
the reason it all came out of my mouth
was because I thought it was regular
water and then and then just stop being
sparkling water so I like joked on it
this is actually like way down my
memories like all the way at the bottom
this is what you could say swap with
people from your camera roll so I got
the idea to get a picture of Ludacris
and do the Ludacris wrap it was so good
I wanted you to sit like a bunch of
different people but but let's watch
let's enjoy when I was 13 I have my
first club there was nobody to compare
to my video nobody came between us okay
ever come above oh my god okay I'm back
did I even show of it am I gonna get
demonetized
for this I'm not going to put it up on
the screen because some people miss
insensitive but um okay so my
neighborhood has like a neighborhood
body well they are rabbit it's like a
full-grown rabbit and I named it beaver
the bunny oh I saw your video my mom
calls me down and is right fucked I
should be laughing but it was Susan it
was so sad it was dead right from my
house
and it was like hard like a rock like
I've never seen a dead animal before
like I've never had a pet dies this is
my first time I've seen any six dead um
so I wanted to get a picture with the
bunny I don't know why but that's the
first thing that ran through my head is
like let's take a picture with it
I captured it you will be missed baby
the bunny a true trap dude did I say
that it said a true trap dude r.i.p I
did the same thing at the video people
exactly from météo pieces yes I am I
was Josh Douglas Halloween okay I feel
like that's enough telling I'm the only
one who's going to buy this video fight
but I hope you guys enjoyed watching me
laugh at myself don't worry I'm not
trying to become like a comedian YouTube
or anything but if you'd want to see
more like personal videos like this give
