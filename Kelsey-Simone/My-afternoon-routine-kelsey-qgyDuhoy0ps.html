what I do when I come home from whatever
I was doing that day I normally just put
my bag down and greet my cat and I
normally sit here on my bed and take
outfit pictures I have a blog where I
take everyday outfit pictures so I tried
do them every day but I don't always as
you can see I was trying the snapchat
filters I normally do that and
snapchatting a friend or something but
after I get home I normally just like
putz around for an hour to or you know
something like that and then my bedside
table will totally match my aesthetic I
have tons of cute stuff that I used to
decorate that um and kit actually sent
me and I'll have a picture on my IG by
the way wink wink
go check out my IG the tons of you´d
stuff like this little light up kay they
sent me um
these marble chargers which are my life
oh my gosh I love marble and they sent
me a charger which is also useful as you
can see I was listening to probably a
really good song also what I like to do
when I get home is put on my Spotify but
I was listening to my worship playlist
and then today I put on my random chill
stuff and I got out of my like clothing
and I primeur comfortable clothing so I
ended up eating food with my mom but I
didn't like film that and then I just
made a cup of tea literally been buying
so many mugs it's crazy probably bought
about three this week but this one was
sent to me from an kit it's so cute I
can't even to get it it also says hello
beautiful on the inside which is really
cute and then for some reason I thought
it would be like cool to like pull
myself dancing sells us new music but
then like I just ended up looking really
stupid but then again Here I am actually
putting it in the video so enjoy that
come back upstairs so this is the part
where I come to my desk and like to
pretend that I'm productive even though
I'm really not but guys it just it makes
me feel special so let me live my life
sometimes I am actually a little bit
productive and I'll write down like
video ideas or like blog post ideas or
like I'll play in something if I'm
actually ever doing anything
my life then I went over to my couch as
you can see I'm very social and I talked
to my family a lot and I talk to my
friends and hang out with people so much
that like I just need to like relax you
know probably watching like Netflix like
maybe like some weird movie at amoeba
now so then before I go to bed I always
do my I guess this is a skincare routine
video as well so the first thing I do is
I wash my makeup off I take makeup wipes
these are Neutrogena makeup wipes and
you just take all of my makeup off of my
face because I have great sheets and I
cannot sleep with makeup on and then I
just wash my face I use this little like
skin cleaner brush thing not really sure
what it's called and then I wash my face
and I use this face wash but I actually
want to get a new face wash I don't
really like this one because I want one
that like foams up so when I use little
scrubber brush it like has like you know
bubbles all over my face and is that
weird like I literally only want to buy
a face wash just because it leaves
bubbles on my face and then I ended up
backing up and getting out of focus um q
Kelsey and then I just wish I was my
face my Mac comfort cream face
moisturizer which is one of my favorites
I love it because I really dry skin and
this just makes my skin really saw and I
rub that all over my face
and then I let my Mane free to not
actually mine I use hair extensions if
you guys actually want a video my hair
extensions I have one I'll link that
below but yeah and then this is me
trying to get my cat to love me and
failing but I hope you guys enjoyed my
afternoon routine letting you guys into
my life a little bit more I hope you
