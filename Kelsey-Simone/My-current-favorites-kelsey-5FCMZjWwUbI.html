just don't even I don't even know what's
going on in here
backfist guys so today I'm going to be
filming a favorites video for you I just
noticed that I had a lot of favorite
things that I wanted to talk about it's
more of a fashion sort of favorites
video I do have like three products I
think but then the rest of it is like
all just fashion so I thought that I
would film a favorites video and I know
I told you guys on a you now that I was
gonna post this like yesterday I think
but I did film it when I said I would
film it but then I ended up not liking
the video and I just didn't want to put
out like a crappy video so um this is me
filming it part two so the first thing
I'm going to talk about yes so you guys
have already seen this bag on an
Instagram post um but I love this bag
I've been eating a new bag for like a
while I've been using the same one for
like over a year so I didn't want to
spend too much on a purse so I was just
like casually shopping and I was like
when I find it I'll find one and I was
at forever 21 with one of my friends and
I like saw it on a shelf from like
across the store and I was like yes
that's the one I like really structured
bags like this with like a really like
nice just form like I don't like flimsy
floppy bags like I like ones with a lot
of structure and I like the shape that
this one has I like the bold detail
because a lot of my purses have silver
detail and I like the gold a lot better
and then I also got one of these like
little fluffy balls for I have so many
of these guys I have like a collection
of these key chains but then um I also
got one of the gold um thing to match so
the next thing I'm going to talk about
is not really like a specific item it's
in a kind of it's only like three things
so it's going to be a good mini haul
kind of so the next thing is a website
called wenzer store pretty well-known
they like seller stuff in Seventeen
magazine I was thinking of going to the
prom this year so I was looking at their
prom justice save really cute prom
dresses that are really cheap and I
didn't know but they also sell clothes
that are pretty cheap and they're so
cute
so I'm going to show you what I got from
them I got a dress that I posted on my
Instagram editing healthy insert picture
somewhere on the screen I love that
dress
is like yes so also when I got with this
jacket I've been wearing so so so much
love winter the only thing I need about
winter is having a cute outfit and then
like having to ruin it with an ugly
jacket but this one is so cute then I
also get to like still look stylish at
the same time so it's like a green just
a long bomber jacket and it just kind of
has these black detailing 's and it has
the black collar and it has you know all
these little like zipper pockets on the
sleeves and the zippers obviously and I
love the color of it I love this olive
color and I also got two pairs of shoes
just just look at them tell me you can't
wear these and not feel like you're
gonna run the world and like stomp down
your enemies but like I love the pointed
toe I used to hate pointed toe shoes and
I used to despise pointed toe shoes I
thought they were so ugly
until I recently just randomly started
getting into them and they're like this
velvety material which I really like
that and they're not the most
comfortable shoe in the world but
they're really cute just look at them
these are so cute they're like right
above the ankle they are lace-up heels
and they're just new these are my first
pair of nude shoes guys and I love nude
which is actually my next favorite thing
um so this kind of like ties into it but
they're so these are really going to be
my spring shoe because as you can tell
I'm not a very colorful person so I feel
like this is just away from you like add
color into my wardrobe but it's still
not even a color it's not black white or
grey so like best of both worlds but um
yeah it has like the gold accents and
it's got all the little holes peep toe
so it can be best spring heel like I
said my next favorite thing is nude I
don't have anything like physically show
you but I have tons of nude stuff I have
nude hots I have new t-shirts I have new
dresses I have even a new jacket I have
new tank tops I have nude coats even
nude fingernails
I love nude stuff I love that color I
feel like it's definitely going to be so
popular in the spring I mean I already
know
popular now and I just think it just it
looks really cute the next favorite I
want to talk about is something I'm
wearing right now which is this choker
necklace and I thought my choker days
were over little did I know I would be
wearing them still um so this thick
choker has been pretty popular you
probably thought this like ensemble here
was from American Apparel that you're
wrong I saw this that's where I got the
trend from I saw it at American Apparel
because they have this say like off the
shoulder shoulder they have the same off
the shoulder shirt with like the
matching necklace like it's like
attached in the back and I saw it and I
was like I have a body suit the same
thing long sleeve black off the shoulder
why would I pay $20 for that however
much they probably aren't like talk shop
or American Apparel the shirt was like
$39 like I can find that somewhere
cheaper this 2-pack was $1 these are
literally headbands and I put them
around my neck and they look exactly the
same as the ones kendall Jenner any
other celebrity who's ever worn these
any youtuber who wears this it's the
same literally the same thing so just
without a tag on it two necklaces even
have tags
I literally flung that across the room
tying in with that is the body suit
trend I love body suits and this is my
most recent one adding to the collection
collection of like two but I'm gonna I'm
gonna start a collection this is the one
that got me hooked on body suits that I
was like yes I need to buy more of these
so this one I got from forever 21 and it
just is black with this little like
white outlines but they're so cute this
one has a pretty low back you can't tell
but like when I put it on the backs kind
of low and it kind of makes me think of
like you know like a lifeguard how it be
like red and white but it's like black
and white I swear you can wear these as
one-piece bathing suits you probably can
and don't be surprised if you see me
wearing them as one-piece bathing suit
and it's just really cute it has a
little like v-neck line collar thing
definitely cute definitely need to buy
tons more okay so now I'm going to move
on to beauty products I only have three
three first product that I have is my
loving tan Tanner and okay so last
summer you guys requested like crazy for
me to do a like tanning routine like
what I use and all that
stuff and I never did one because I just
like wasn't comfortable with the Tanner
I was using I was still constantly
searching for like a really good one
that I liked I was going through like a
bunch of random ones but I love this one
this is a pretty cheap brand I use ones
way more expensive than this and I still
like this better um so this is an
Australian brand um so I didn't actually
get this from a store you do have to
order it online but it came really
really fast I have a dark one in a
medium one so I used the dark one on
like my whole body like my legs and arms
and stuff and then the medium one I use
on places where I don't want it to be as
dark like I use it on my face I use this
on my hands my feet and like down my
neck and stuff like that I love the
moves I feel like it's just the easiest
to use rather than like a lotion or a
spray or anything like that
also just look at the packaging like
it's so cute it's like a pink little
waddle and it's just so pretty
so also besides these I have their
little glove which oh my gosh oh my gosh
okay I am in no way a professional
tailor so I have no clue how to self-tan
so this is life okay so it is so velvety
and so soft and this makes it just apply
so much smoother and also so that you
don't get like all those like nasty
stains on your hands afterwards but um
what I like about this one is all the
other brands I've tried that you can buy
their mitts they're normally like pink
or white and then you get like this
stain of like the tan all over and it's
disgusting but this one's black so you
don't see it also I have this glove that
is a removing glove so it like
exfoliates you just wet it like when
you're in the shower and you scrub your
tan off with this I currently don't have
a tan on as you can see from my paleness
I almost match the background but I just
scrubbed it off my old Chan because I'm
getting ready to like apply a new one
basically this also is a lifesaver quick
tip you know how like in areas like
maybe around your wrist or your feet if
you do self Chan and normally like it
can like kind of be darker and blotchy
all you have to do is wet your skin and
use this and rub the parts that that
came out a lot darker and it literally
just blends it in like perfectly this is
this is magical it's like a self tanner
racer and all you need is water it's
perfect they're so amazing I love their
brand when I got the box they sent me
like all these little like um they were
called Tim Tams like these chocolate
Australian
Andie's and it was so good I only have
like four left and they probably sent me
like 20 of them and then also I got this
little card which is so cute um and then
a little note on the back I it was so
cute like overload of cuteness
I'm definitely if right before summer
starts if you guys want to see like a
routine plus like tips like I said I'm
not a professional how to make it easier
on you then I can do a video okay so I
have two products left this is a makeup
product this is the Urban Decay all
nighter makeup setting spray the
long-lasting one I've just noticed that
like by the time I will do my makeup at
my house and it will be like on fleek
ready to go yes and then I'll get to the
mall be shopping around and then like
two hours later I'll look at him here
and be like where's my makeup like I
swear I put on makeup this morning all I
see is mascara so this has helped me it
definitely helps make my makeup last
longer it's just kind of like laminate
for your makeup if that makes sense like
seals your makeup in and I love it it is
amazing and this is the small bottle so
this was like $15 but they do have a
bigger bottle this is the last product
that I have oh my gosh this is a
lifesaver like yes so an kit sent me
this and I was like okay cool like what
even is this and so I thought it was
just one of those things that you plug
it into your car and like it charges
your phone or whatever it's not so first
of all can we talk about that it's
marble and it's really cute so if your
friends like hey my phone's dead and
I'll be like I can fix that and I'll do
it in style what it is is it holds it's
basically an outlet that's like the
easiest way I can describe it so if
you're out and you need to charge your
phone you're like oh my phone is dead
where do i plug this in you're in a car
and like that it's already being used or
you don't have one of those plug or
fingies and or like you're in the mall
and you have nowhere to plug your phone
in because I never bring that cube with
me I only bring the cord so this
basically is your outlet you plug it
into here and this holds one full charge
like it holds like a hundred percent
like one phone battery in here you do
have to charge this before you leave but
I just put it in my purse and like I'm
ready to go so if my phone dies I can
charge a whole another 100% using this
and that's just so useful to me so
helpful I will link this in
description box I'll link everything
else like I'll link the shoes I'll link
the code I'll link the Tanner I'll link
blah blah blah all that stuff will be in
the description bar as well as my links
to we're going to take it we're going to
take a picture that looks terrible
that looks so terrible we're doing that
again probably not posting that but that
was all of my favorites currently right
now I hope you guys enjoyed this video

comment down below anything you'd like
subscribe all my links will be in the
description bar I love you guys so much
