a video about my hair because you guys
really requested one and I thought since
I already have an everyday makeup
routine why not do an everyday hair
routine but yeah it's that like you know
whole like I haven't done my hair in
three days and it naturally looks like
this sort of thing but um I mean I like
it that's this is just how I do my hair
I show you guys how would you accomplish
this look with short hair this is just
how I simply style my short hair and I
hope you guys enjoy if you want to know
how I do this then um proceed I
literally don't know what I'm doing so
starting off I just have my hair and I
haven't straightened um so let you guys
know this is not like my natural hair I
don't have naturally straight hair I
have naturally really really curly hair
but that would take forever to
straighten it on camera so just start
with straight hair that's all I'm saying
start with right here I'm going to be
taking my straightener this is from
irresistible me which is the same brand
I use my extensions from but because
this is just my short natural hair I'm
not gonna be using my symptoms today but
they sent me this hair straightener and
I oh my gosh my old straightener that I
had was like blue and it had like orange
floral print on it and it was broken in
the ceramic the ceramic things were
broken and it took like 20 minutes to
heat up wash this way okay let's do 450
okay watch that look how fast the heats
up it's already at 308 it's already at
30 34 it just almost there 386 410 421
done look how fast that was it's
probably my favorite feature it also has
frizz resistance in it which is so
amazing for me because of my naturally
curly hair it's so easy to get it super
frizzy when I'm straightening it and I
don't really blow-dry straighten my hair
so having a straightener
with frezz resistance is great also
these have like coolie grip cool Egret
okay they have coolie grips on the
outside of the straightener so I can
hold this on the outside for as long as
I want to and I'm not going to burn
myself which is great because I always
like when I straighten i like press down
like that and that part doesn't get hot
okay so now that you have straight hair
I kind of have it in a middle part
sometimes I wear it in a middle part
sometimes I sweep it to the side I feel
like it's just easier to do it when it's
in the middle part so I'm going to use a
straightener still I'm going to use the
same technique that I would do it when
curling my hair with a straightener but
um we're gonna do it just kind of only
half way down at the hair I'm going to
take a little bit of a smaller section
because I feel like the smaller this
section the more wavy it looks so I just
kind of like bend it like that as you
can see this one is really really pretty
and like really structured I don't do
this for all of them I normally only
make them look really pretty nice on
like the front and the top halves and
then once I sort of get to the bottom
half of the hair and in the back I sort
of just like twist the ends a little bit
on same looks like a little in between
pieces I'll just sort of like twist the
ends and make them sort of just like
kinked like that the reason I use the
straightener
I like the straightener a lot better
than a curler is because I feel like
when you use a straightener
all of your hair comes out sort of
different looking I feel like with a
curler they can tend to like all sort of
look the same also what I like about
this hairstyle is that it's really good
for like second and third day hair like
if I do my hair like this I can normally
wear my hair like this for like it looks
better once I'm done and I've slept on
it and just the next day it's even more
natural and wavy and kinky than it was
before
Oh
Stark
oh I'm close to them before
I will think on my feet
I'm also one thing I do like about the
straightener with my short hair than my
curler um if you have short hair you
will know the struggle of trying to use
a curling wand um in not burning your
neck okay it's probably one of the
hardest things I've ever tried to do
before like I said because it has the
cooling things on the outside even if I
do touch my neck it doesn't get hot and
it doesn't burn me so to be a little bit
more precise on like how I curl I'll do
this front section for you because I
like doing really small section piece in
the front cuz I feel like they really
frame the face so I'm doing them away
from my face because I like that whole
Eagle wind below and like it's a blown
away make sense going to take this in
the direction and I'm going to twist it
away and just sort of like clamp and
pull down
I'm going to be taking two different
products the first product I'm using is
this aqua aged sea salt spray you can
use any sea salt spray that you want and
I just sort of like spritz this towards
the bottom of my hair and I just sort of
like scrunch and like run my fingers
through and like Tassel it out this I
use every day this alright this hair
look is my every day summer hair look
like I don't not wear this in the summer
like this is just how I do my hair it is
foolproof it's so easy to do but like
look so cute and does it not like scream
hey it's summertime all I do is I fresh
it up with some dry shampoo this is the
batiste dry shampoo and fruity a cheeky
cherry best dry shampoo ever the only
one I use this is not sponsored but I'm
habitus if you want to pay me go ahead
I'll just take little sections at the
top and that scares me every time I've
never not been scared by that and I just
would like take my fingers and like you
know go in there so I'm sort of getting
this getting it wool again all back here
so now my hair is big and beautiful and
I can do really whatever I want with it
literally the only hair product I have
is a straightener because its dual
purpose like I straighten my hair with
this and I also CRO my hair with this so
it's like saving money you don't need to
buy two different things also about
saving money I have a coupon code you're
welcome so if you want to buy this hair
straightener that I'm using I have a
coupon code I will give it below and I
will link all this stuff below also the
same thing with all my hair extensions
I'll link that below so yeah I normally
keep it in a metal part just because I
feel like I like the middle part but
definitely if I want to like spice it up
a bit I don't know right now I'm feeling
in the middle part so that is pretty
much my like everyday sort of hair
routine just how I do my hair on a
typical basis a go-to hair look for my
short hair yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
