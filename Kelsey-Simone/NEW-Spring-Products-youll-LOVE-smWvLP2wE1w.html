exciting video I'm super excited to just
dive into this I'm so blessed and so
honored that I am again working with
Sephora which is super exciting this
before is like a huge brand I loved
before who does most work if you love
makeup you love Sephora they send me a
big box of all of their newest products
all the brand new stuff so physical
things in there that I'm already like
looking at right now as an item down the
whole intro lap so thank you to Sephora
for sending me this box I love you so
much bliss love you guys all these
products are brand new but they are
already out for sale in Sephora and
online solving all the products down
below the Sephora website down below if
you happen to purchase any of these
products and you like post about it I
love when you guys do that by the way
when you guys closed us and it has to do
with my videos make sure to use the
hashtag a new app before I always the
hashtag on the screen somewhere so the
first thing I'm going to be talking
about is the new bite cream lip gloss
collection which they sent me every
single color this one's so beautiful
they're so gorgeous so these are lip
creams which basically like they're like
lip glosses but like they're a little
bit more moisturizing cuz they've shea
butter in them so they're not like all
sticky and gross they don't like dry
your lips out you know but these are
like all metallic colors they're a
little bit more than the challenge those
off they're intense like the
pigmentation amuses insane so I'm going
to start with this one which is
champagne pearl this is the one that was
in my giveaway this is the one that I
have only has literally one quick swipe
like they're so highly pigmented but the
color is just in so intense I'm actually
gonna put this on and then this one is
bronze pearl this is like my second
favorite because it's like this super
deep like a rusty bronze color oh my god
literally with one swipe this one's
gorgeous and they're so sparkly too this
one's called rose pearl this one's like
whoa it's like gold but also like rose
at the same time ooh
it was this one like iridescent it's
like two different colors depending on
the way that the light hits it this
one's called pink pearl those two would
probably be like
pretty like mixed together you know what
I'm saying they're so like fascinating
to look at this one is like the craziest
color of them all this one's like a
mixture of like blue and purple
iridescent oh my god whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa look at that it's like blue has
this weird purple undertone but it's
like a dark almost black looking how
does how do they do that and this is the
last one this is oyster pearl which this
one's gorgeous - it's like a purple and
silver sort of foil ooh that one's
pretty they're more wearable than it
looks from the bottle that's pretty I
forgot to mention the face smells so
good it's like this cherry like fruity
smell I don't know what it is but they
smell amazing okay so I clean my hand
we're back and ready to go so they sent
me these three perfumes and you probably
already know the first thing I'm going
to say about them the packaging though
so aesthetically pleasing so cute even
the bottles are cute too so all three of
these perfumes are from a brand called
commodity which I've never heard them
before this is like a newer brand so
these are what the bottles look like
it's super classy and chic the commodity
on it so I kind of already spelled them
all already but the bergamot is my
favorite so I'll start with that one all
of you for you can be worn by anybody
they're super like seven and they're
super masculine I normally wear super
like fresh clean floral II sort of scent
and this is like closest to like what I
normally wear all the time it just has
that sort of like fresh crisp citrusy
smell that I really like
I don't wear citrus all the time but in
the summer which we're coming into
summer I really like wearing citrusy
scent so that is why I love this one the
most it's something you would wear on
vacation if you know what I'm saying but
the next one is leather which i think is
a big - the perfect name for this
because that's like exactly like what I
think about when I smell this is a super
musky scent which my mom wears musky
perfumes all the time I don't really do
that I don't like harsher perfumes but
if you like strong sounds like that's
really what it is she's probably gonna
steal this from the I already know that
and then the last one we have is Zetas
fur
like to a medium between the both of the
other two like it is very like woodsy
and stuff but it's also super like mild
at the same time maybe this one's my
favorite weird but it kind of has like a
like a good Beach Boys now so these also
so good and the boxes I'm probably
always put these on my vanity okay so
the next thing that they sent me is a
bumble and bumble here product I'm
really excited about because I don't
have any of their products in all of my
friends is bumble and bumble hair
products so I've never tried them I
don't have any products from them so I'm
really excited to try this out this is
called the Soomro clay workable clay
format dry texture feels like a hair
promise I have one of the oh my god it
smells so good but I have another one of
these it's just sort of like a matte
calming for your hair which basically
take a little bit in your finger you run
it through the end you just sort of
scrunch them in your hair and add some
texture but it keeps it matte it doesn't
leave your hair looking like crispy and
greasy as if you put like gel in it if
you know what I'm saying but is it just
me and you ever see a super smooth
texture and you're just so tempted to
poke it but oh I'm so weird what other
beauty guru does is kind of thanks for
watching thanks for staying this long in
the video because I don't really know I
thought this is so squishy it's good for
all hair types I think that anybody can
use this an eye really curly hair so it
just sort of like helps for my curls and
give them texture where I feel like also
if you have straight hair you like give
your hair like a little like that beachy
sort of messy wave sort of look so thank
you Sephora for sending this girl some
skin care so they sent me a Newland
Eriksen product which I have a couple of
cool erickson products and I like
everything that I have from them this is
the balance counterbalance oil control
hydrator okay just friend that this has
rose hips through extracting it I love
roses extracts of oil I have tons of
face masks so basically this is like a
hydrator that's not going to leave you
with a super greasy growth like butters
nastiness
which is good news I normally only talk
about really intense super hydrating
hydrators so this one's good for if you
have combination skin or oily skin and
you just don't really want all that
extra oil and grease on your skin also
this says that it is pore filling like
it balances your skin out which is
really cool I will
heard of a hydrator that fills your
pores which is really cool so it's the
rosehip oil it smells so good so then
these are so super cute I'm actually
really happy they sent me these these
are benefit like little travel makeup
kits which I am traveling so much this
summer so expect some vlogs coming soon
but I never have travel size makeups so
they all have like scenes on them which
is so adorable I'll start with this one
too this gold and gold's my favorite so
the first one is called date night with
mr. right never experienced that before
I think this is so cute what a good idea
so in this one it has a rocket to your
blush it's just as many like natural
tone blush there's a very real mascara
which is an amazing mascara so what's up
highlighter which I have the full size
and I love it and then the bear grylls
double the list this is in the shade
lust eros which I have this as well glow
all the way I am girl I am benefit
thanks girl okay and then this one's
called a if it should be a rapper this
one's called the instead of work it girl
it's like work it girl like work work
kit girl work it girl that's so smart so
this one is the work day essential
makeup kit so this one was just like you
know like at the office so inside the
blue package we have a mini hoola
bronzer so adorable we have a mini own
mini roller lash which I'm throwing this
in my first because this is like my
go-to mascara that's what I have on a
mini benefit which is so cute and then a
mini travel size the professional
primers and then the last one is called
someday my prince will come
I get it instead of some day my prince
will come it's some day my prince will
come benefit has got the dad joke and
hopefully Sunday my prince will come
like Sunday on Church I know Jesus
turquoise I'm not a pink fan but I love
this I love the gold glitter I look good
with everything so this is so adorable
in the side of this one oh we have a
high beam highlighter which I love this
highlighter so we have a little their
real tinted primer oh it's a last
present idiot it's a lash primer which
don't have any of those
that's really cool and then they have a
mini gimme brow we talk about how small
that is
oh my god that's adorable it's a little
cutie brow and then we also have the
California this is a blush it's like a
more coral blush which is super pretty
for the summer in the spring coming up
so these are so adorable I love these
I'm going to be definitely traveling
with these and the last thing that I
have is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
micro finishing loose powder so this is
like a loose sort of setting powder like
something you would bake with or just
like set your makeup with most like
translucent powders always have this
weird like effect charm camera with the
flash this loose powder does not have
problems with Slash superfine and I love
setting my under eyes isn't my favorite
part about this is how like the
packaging is setup I just posted all
over the voice but it has like this
little like fabric signe that like lets
the powder through I don't know why I
think that that's so cool but it's so
cool obviously anybody can use this it's
translucent so it's good for any skin
tone any sort of skin type anybody can
use this and that was everything that
they have sent me I'm really excited to
