the Empire State Building and look how
pretty this rooftop is and there's like
where all the people are like getting
ready and stuff so the designer came up
to me and asked me to walk in the show

really scared but I've never done
anything like that in my life like I've
never walked for anybody before so I
said no but I mean it's kind of cool
