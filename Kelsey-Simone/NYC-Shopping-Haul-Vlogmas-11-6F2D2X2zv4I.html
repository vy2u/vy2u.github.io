waiting for our uber we're about to go
to our little dinner not dinner it's
like a little business meeting that
we're having I don't think I'll be able
to really belong the meeting so I'll
just vlog afterwards
and then this is moms look kind of
similar to mine with the black boots the
mom jeans the black fur coat yeah this
bathrooms so pretty we just got finished
with a little business meeting this is
the bathroom to the restaurant but it's
a little mo mirror outfit of the day
okay we just got we just got moksha I
loved chachi bachi I actually made a
video on some of my favorite places to
eat in New York so I'll link that video
if you guys want to see it but I got ice
cream even though it's so cold outside I
still really wanted something she got
like a latte yeah much a latte right now
we're walking to the Flatiron Building
to take some pictures for my mom and
probably for me too yeah you can't
really see the building but there it is
cuz it's so bright but yeah not that
interesting of a clip but there you go
I actually don't feel really good so
we're kind of just like taking it easy
we're gonna go down to 5th Avenue and go
shopping because I really wanted to go
to the IRISA and then we might go to a
couple stores afterwards and then we're
just going to probably head home
so right now we're in a ritzy I'm trying
on these Levi's jeans I've been really
wanting these pair I was gonna buy them
online but then I was like might as well
since we're here try them on and I like
them so I'm gonna get that awkward
transition oh we could see awkward
transition I'm sorry but we're back home
now I didn't really vlog anything else
in New York because after Starbucks we
just went straight home I didn't vlog in
the car because one that was kind of
boring as well as um I just put on my
worship playlist and just fell asleep so
um yeah but I'm home and I thought to
finish off the vlog I'd give you a
little haul of not only when I got in
New York but when I came home I had some
packages of clothes that had cotton to
me because I only went to one store in
New York oh I went to multiple but I
only bought from one store the only
story that I bought stuff from was a
ritzy ax they're definitely one of my
favorite stores I only got one thing
which you saw me get which is I got
these the wedgie fit Levi's they're
high-waisted light blue and they have
little rips at the knees and then
they're just shredded at the bottom I
really wanted these I know I have a lot
like these but all of mine sort of none
of them are skinny at the bottom they're
all sort of like you know sort of flared
or like loose fitted I wanted a pair
that were actually tight like skinny
jeans cuz none of mine are then I have a
package from IMG a-- they sent me some
stuff so thanks you guys I picked out
this oh my god I've been wanting this
for so long it's like they're super very
huge like hoody sweater
so it says jeah here and then it has the
of course pockets in the front and then
it also has like a drawstring at the
bottom so that you can like make it more
like tapering and fit in but this is
going to be definitely the warmest thing
ever and it's so super cute I've been
loving this whole teddy bear look so I
really like it and it's just like super
over sigh it's already oversized which
is good so you don't have to like get it
to size up this is actually the size
small so yeah I've been obsessed with
this ever since I saw it on their
website I was again
and then I also got they're all famous
the tan-colored Cobain pant so they look
like this they're like a cargo kind of
Army styled pants so they look like this
they have the silver chain and they're
just super long and then they like taper
around the ankle I've seen so many
people wearing these and I just love the
way that they look and then also I got a
pair of sweatpants these are their
blaster pant in black so they're these
sweatpants they're like red and yellow
in the like middle and they're super
heavy like they're thick material so
you're gonna be warm with these these
are the pockets and then on the side it
just says the IMG a thing all the way
down then this company called mistress
Rox they contacted me on Instagram
through DM and asked me if I wanted some
stop and I looked through their site and
I was like yes I don't know if you can
see the color on camera but it's just
like a simple sort of slinky bodycon
dress with like a lower back and it's
just this chocolate brown color I've
been really getting into the color like
chocolate brown I don't know why I
actually also have something else Brown
and then showing you on camera like this
won't give you justice for this dress so
I'll probably I'll definitely do like an
Instagram post or something with this
dress you can see it in its full glory
but I got this like super long it's a
maxi dress it's silver and silky but it
also has a slit in it like a super high
slit and I really love it
um I also got this cheetah print dress
she is also something I've been getting
into recently I've been loving cheetah
print so it's like this straight across
sort of it has that cowl neck look that
I've been getting into and like a super
low back I didn't know it had that low
of a back and it's just like flowy at
the bottom it is very see-through so
you're probably gonna have to wear like
something underneath of it obviously and
then the last thing that I got from them
is also that chocolatey brown color it's
like this long silk jacket I really love
long jackets you guys know that I prefer
them over everything and I love the silk
so yeah that's my little like half new
york half mil Boxhall give this video a
