going to be doing a makeup tutorial on
this look it's got a gold glitter liner
perfect for the New Year's and any sort
of holiday party you may have I wear
this on Christmas Eve and a lot of you
guys were requesting a tutorial for the
look so here it is and I hope you enjoy
of course like any makeup tutorial we're
gonna start off with a fresh no makeup
face and we're gonna moisturize my lips
because it's the winter time you know
everybody's getting a little chapped so
this one is the caramel one from fresh
it's the bomb it's amazing I'm gonna put
my hair up so I don't get makeup in my
hair because that's kind of gross to
bread my face I'm going to be using this
Laura Mercier hydrating primer this kind
of does both the jobs of my moisturizer
and my primer in one I think it's a
really great product it makes my skin
look
oh.hello really good not gonna lie so
just rubbing that and you know like you
do and then we're gonna go straight onto
foundation I'm using the Laura Mercier
illuminating tinted moisturizer you guys
know this is like my go-to and this is
in the shade natural radiance but as I
showed you that little box before I'm
gonna be using a lot of Laura Mercier
brushes like this one this is their flat
top foundation brush they sent them to
me so I thought I'd try them out and I
actually liked every single one that I
tried in this video if the brush is not
from the set I will state otherwise but
this one I'm using currently is from the
set it is their like I said their flat
top brush which you know the one I
usually use is from ELF which I still
highly recommend that one it's really
nice and really affordable so now I'm to
concealer well technically it's not a
concealer it's an under eye brightener
this is from YSL it does not have a lot
of coverage so if that's something you
need then I would just recommend using
whatever concealer you guys like to use
but since it doesn't have a lot of
coverage I'm gonna use it to sort of
brighten up my face under where I in
contour you know on my forehead the tip
of my nose and my chin and then we're
gonna blend that that craziness out this
brush is not from the set this one is
from ELF they have a lot of good brushes
now that I'm thinking about it I use a
lot of ELF brushes but I just like the
way it makes my concealer look when it
blends it out super just airbrushed and
like super natural just I don't know
look at it just see the way just kind of
like shoo yeah look at that ooh that
looks so good and then I'm gonna set all
of that with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and alarm or CA I
think this is their concealer or like
their powder concealer brush and I'm
just gonna set underneath my eyes as
well as my eyelids because they get sort
of greasy
that's not cute and then I'm also going
to set my smile lines because I find
that sometimes my makeup takes up there
and I don't like that so I powder that
area then we're going to go straight
into bronzer this is the Sun bunny
bronzer from Too Faced I'm gonna take my
really huge fluffy Marc Jacobs brush you
guys know I use this one a lot it's more
of like a bronzing glowy effective than
like a harsh contour so I like using
this brush but we're still gonna like
pinpoint it and really chisel ourselves
out you know you kinda want to look like
this guy and then I'm gonna go on and
clean up that concealer underneath now
highlighting this is the Laura Geller
gilded honey highlighter my absolute
fave you guys know this is like my child
I love it so much we're gonna use
alarmers a fan brush spray it with some
spray and ba-bam look at that super
glowing super easy just know wow it just
looks so good I can't even talk right it
just looks so good so I'm gonna
highlight the typical areas and
accentuating that highlight on the tip
of my nose cuz I think that's adorable
my Cupid's bow chin forehead brow bone
cheekbone you know pretty much every
place we didn't contour so yeah just
kind of throwing that everywhere and
then I'm gonna set my face we'll just
sort of hydrate it with the caudally
this is the grape water that I got for
Christmas I've been really loving it it
makes my makeup look super good then for
my brows I'm gonna use both of these
glossy a the boy brows first I'm gonna
go in with the clear one just to sort of
groom my hairs and brush them all in the
right direction because sometimes they
look just a little bit crazy so I got to
basically tell my hairs where to go and
then I'm gonna go in with the tinted boy
brow now this just sort of darkens them
it'll fill in it'll shape a little bit
but I'd normally keep them just like
this but since we're doing more of a
high glam party makeup look I am going
to fill them in even more to define them
with a pencil the pencil of that I use
is the Dior brows Tyler and I just sort
of make little light strokes just like
an underline of the shape of my eyebrow
and then I'll use the spoolie brush at
the other end of the pencil to just sort
of blend it up into my brow I don't like
them looking too harsh but my brows do
tend to get a little bit more sparse and
have like little empty areas at the ends
of my brows so I just like to fill that
in a little bit I just sort of brush
through them until I'm happy with the
way that
look and then to clean them up a little
bit I am going to conceal them I use the
same under eye brightener from before
with this sort of square flat brush Wow
this this is from the laura mercier set
it just looks amazing look how just
satisfying that is it got such a clean
cut precise line I was really impressed
with this brush but now that my face
makeups done you can take your hair down
and we're gonna move straight on to the
eyes we're gonna go into eyeshadow with
the tartlet in bloom Tarte palette now
I'm gonna take this smarty-pants color
it's just sort of like this neutral
bronze transition shade you could also
use your bronzer if you want and just a
sort of fluffy circular crease brush
from the Laura Mercier set I'm gonna
take that in my crease as well as pack
that onto the outer corner of my bottom
lid now you'll notice I dragged my
shadow up into sort of like this V shape
on the outer corner of my eye I just
find it flattering but it's not like you
don't have to do that I just think it
looks really cool so and then I sort of
clean that up again with the same
precise brush and I'll drag that on my
bottom lash line and then do those same
steps on the other eye now I take this
funny girl color it's like a champagne
sort of shimmery glittery color it's
just sort of fun I like adding glitter
on my lids especially if I'm going to
like a party or like you know it's New
Year's or something
and then moving straight onto the
eyeliner so this liner is a liquid liner
from NYX now the reason I'm doing a
white wing first before the glitter is
because one the glitter is very messy so
having this sort of outline and base to
go on top of makes it look so much more
precise and sleek than just doing it
with the glitter as well as the white
definitely makes it pop more you could
use black but I think the white base
just makes it look so much better now
just side note this does get kind of on
your lashes so make sure when you put
your mascara on to really coat that and
just make sure to make it look all sleek
and nice but let this dry before putting
on the glitter that's very important
because it'll get a total mess if you
don't so this is the Midnight Cowboy
glitter liner from Urban Decay this is
from their heavy metal eyeliner
collection now the brush that it comes
with is not the world's most precise
brush so I did use that for the thicker
part of my wing but for the tip of my
wing and like the outline where it's
very thin where you need it to look very
sleek and precise I use this angled
brush from the
set and I thought it made it look so
much better so just a quick tip you can
use another brush a second quick tip is
I also did two coats of the glitter I
found that some areas it's not that it
was patchy but just that I could use
more glitter so once it completely dried
I did end up going in later and putting
a second coat now for the mascara and as
you can see I was really rolling it onto
the back of my lashes just to make sure
all that liner on my lashes was covered
but you want to get like a really nice
coat on your top and bottom lashes you
can just leave it like this I did put
false lashes on on top of that but you
know obviously personal preference you
can do whatever you want
I used the roller lash from benefit
that's just currently my favorite
mascara it's so good and you I hate
watching it I hate watching this part
but I'm tight lining my eyes I know it
looks terrifying that's because it is
and then for my lashes I don't remember
what brand these are they might be our
Dell but they are in the style whispies
if that helps you at all but I just sort
of popped those on there and the lashes
pull together the whole eye look I think
it just makes it look really really good
and I'll pinch them to my real lashes
with my tweezers I think that makes them
look more natural and then I'm done with
that so I'm gonna go onto my lips with
the Natasha donut lip liner in the shade
elf I've just something close to your
natural lip color and then I just sort
of put this nude NARS gloss over the top
from there manray collection but go
ahead and use whatever color you want
and yeah that is it for the whole look I
did some setting spray and then oh yeah
I love doing this part I love putting
just highlighter on my shoulders even
getting it on your color but look at
that you could see wow it looks so great
um it just really adds a nice touch nice
pop nice nice yes to your outfit um so
