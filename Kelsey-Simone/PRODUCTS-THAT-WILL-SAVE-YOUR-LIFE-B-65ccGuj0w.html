channel or welcome to my channel if
you're new today we're having a
beautiful rain stormy day so I thought
I'd just sit inside talk to you guys in
from a little video surprisingly the
lighting is very good right now so I'm
hoping that doesn't change also I'm
sorry if I still sound a little stuffy I
am still not getting over like my little
cold thing so but currently we are
working on my bathroom and I just kind
of noticed how much product I have and
how much I use which is a lot you know
if I had to answer that question if you
were stranded off the deserted island
you can only have three things I would
die I thought it would be a good idea
just to do a little video talking just
non-sports just honestly my favorite
go-to products a lot of these I even use
every single day some of them are new
that I haven't talked to you guys about
yet and some of them I have talked about
before because they're just I've used
them for a long time and I love them I
want to start with this product just
because this is one of my OD products
I've definitely talked about this on my
channel at least in three different
videos so this is from fresh this is
their vitamin nectar vibrancy boosting
face mask now your girl talks about a
lot of face masks I know I've made so
many skincare videos and talked about 50
billion different face masks on my
channel but this is just one that I
honestly love it's like my favorite
go-to face mask if I'm having a
sleepover party and we're putting on
face masks this is the one I'm using it
is packed with tons of vitamins it's
very hydrating it boosts your radiance a
lot it's also a very refreshing face
mask I like to put this on in the
morning it smells like a fruit smoothie
you can even like see chunks of fruit in
it I'm gonna say like 50 times in this
video this smells good because
everything I have here smells amazing
and I mean when I put on a face mask I
mean yeah sure it helps your skin you
know but when I put on a face mask I'm
trying to relax you know I don't want to
have to worry about I have to take this
off in two minutes or also get a
chemical burn you know I just kind of
want to let it sit I will let my face
mask be on for like an hour and this I
can do that with I can leave this on for
three days and it's just it's great next
that we have is actually a duo this was
recently sent to me if you follow me on
Instagram you probably saw on my story
so this is from a brand called
sooo I have both their honey infused
hair mask and then their honey infused
hair oil first of all their packaging is
gorgeous which I you know I'm a sucker
for cute packaging I don't know what it
is about products that I love so much
it's just cute little bottles with
little good-smelling goop's in them and
I love it so I'll kind of use this two
different ways either I'll apply it to
like my dry hair and I'll let it sit for
10 minutes and then I'll rinse it off in
the shower or I'll sort of mix it into
my conditioner when I'm in the shower
and then let that sit and then I'll
rinse it off I recently did this and it
made my hair so soft is I put this in
just like my dry hair and then I also
put this in like a whole palm full of
this just sort of soaked my ends in it
and then I rinsed it off in the shower
my ends looked beautiful um mainly how I
like to use this oil is I'll put some in
my palms when my hair is still damp
after I get out of the shower and then
I'll run it through my hair so that way
when it's dried it's nice and nourished
you know it gets that chance to soak up
the oil more so than just putting it on
your dry hair and then you just look
like you have greasy hair
not a good look I've been really loving
like honey infused products do I've been
noticing that you guys know I'm a
coconut girl love coconut everything
trust me I have coconut everything I
still use my coconut conditioner
religiously um but I actually have
another honey product too I've been
loving honey lately we had this smell
this honey mask like mixed with my
coconut conditioner smell I want to eat
my hair oh boy so speaking of my other
honey product this is from Lancome
you've been following me you'll know
that I went to London with Lancome and
they gave me a bunch of products if you
haven't seen that actually vlog that
trips you should could watch it but they
sent me this product and I was just very
impressed
this is the Lancome foaming cleansing
makeup remover and so I was in my bubble
bath you know do my thing just washing
my makeup off and you know how when you
initially wash your face and then you
come up and you look in the mirror and
then you like you know you expect like a
little bit of a scare of running you
still have a little bit of lip stain on
this got everything off I was so highly
impressed um even I had on like my
toughest mascara that day not waterproof
but just like a good mascara that day it
got it all off in one wash my mom keeps
stealing this from me I have to steal it
back from her bath
because she got obsessed with this too
and again it smells amazing it smells so
good if you followed me for a while you
know that I have a bad habit of tasting
my good smelling products I'm not trying
to endorse tasting your skincare but um
yeah I tasted it and it tastes really
good my mama did abusing it for the
first time she came out of the shower
and she was like by any chance did you
like happen to get that face wash in
your mouth because it tastes so good I
was like girl you already know I'm not
saying to eat your face wash do not eat
your face wash don't do that it's not a
good idea
the next product I have is not a new
product it's a product I've used for a
very long time but surprisingly I think
this is the first time I'm talking about
it I could be wrong but I'm not sure so
this is from bio peel just kidding I
lied it's from neo gen dermatology it's
called bio peel and it's their gods
peeling lemon pads so basically what
this is is these little as you can
I don't know if you can see that you can
get these at Sephora and so it's like a
little pad it has like a little pocket
at the back let me show you so it's like
a little glove mitt you could put your
fingers um and then you like scrub it on
your face so basically it's both
physical and chemically exfoliating for
your face the lemon you know goes really
deep into your pores that makes Foley
it's from the inside and then the gauze
is like a little bit rough so it
exfoliates your skin at the same time
and I just sort of like rub them in
circles all around my face these bad
boys leave your face feeling so good
girlfriend this helps me get my face so
smooth no matter what skin problem I'm
having whether it's just excess dryness
or whether like I have a breakout or
whatever it is this helps my skin just
so insanely much this product is truly a
lifesaver if you know me you know that I
fake tan and I try to fake tan
year-round
and I have tons of friends who fake tan
as well and I always I force them to buy
this product this is from Jerkins this
is their natural glow a daily
moisturizer and I have it in the shade
medium to tan you can get it in like
light/medium medium tan so basically
what it is it's just like a just like a
white looks like a body lotion so
basically you put it on every
and it's supposed to gradually give you
like a natural glowing tan now I've had
tons of products like this before just
not from Jergens like more expensive
ones this full-sized bottle because it
comes in smaller ones too
is only like $8 where I had some other
ones from more expensive brands that
were like $30 and they did not work as
good as this one I had one before where
I was putting it on every day and after
like a week of putting it on every day I
barely notice a difference this was so
intense after the first application of
everything like I already noticed myself
almost a full foundation shade darker I
used this a couple different ways I use
it as like an in-between where like I do
still use my phone tanner but like say
if it's not freshly on I've had it on
for a while and it's just sort of fading
I'll put this on and then wake up in the
morning and it'll be like a booster glow
and it's just it's a really great thing
I would highly recommend this if you've
never faked tan before and you're sort
of you know nervous about it because I
know starting to get into fake tan is
like a little bit scary I would highly
recommend this for beginners because
it's very easy to use I would still
recommend using a glove with it because
it does give you actual color so you
don't want your hands getting dirty but
if you're a beginner to the fake tanning
world this is what I would tell you to
use because you don't get SuperDuper
dark instantly like it is very natural
it's very gradual and I just think it's
amazing I came across this product when
I was shopping in Malibu and I've never
released I know there's like a lot of
things on the market like this but I've
never had anything like this and I love
the brand replica their perfumes are
like honestly my top faith so when I
noticed they came out with a body
product I was like I was honestly
freaking out I was fangirling in Sephora
it's their beach walk which is my
favorite perfume from them by the way
their beach walk dry body oil look at
this fragrance description Sunkist salty
skin I love that I really love that I
like that it's like a spray dispense
because that just makes you know
everything five times easier so you
spray it on it hydrates your body but it
also gives you the scent of the perfume
so it's like a two-in-one you're
moisturizing your body you're getting a
nice little glow which is especially
great for the summer because I always
like to put something super shiny on my
legs and then you also it's your perfume
at the same
time which so mind-blowing to me oh I
love products like this where it's just
it makes my life easier so now on to
makeup products I have actually a couple
lip products so I'll just talk about
them all together first are these a
little like lip chubby sticks which I'm
wearing I think both of them right now I
think I mixed both of them I wear these
all the time these are just like my
throw in my bag sort of lip color so
these are from hourglass and I think
they're both different collections but
this one that I have here is in the
shade nude n2 and then this one as you
can tell I like this one a lot better
because it's barely there this one is in
the shade idealist this one has more of
like a glossy Sheen finish where this
one is very just like matte they're very
easy to just swipe on I like the shape
of them they're very nice so I have
these two lip exfoliator --zz these are
from Frank body which I just love Frank
body in general all of their products
are amazing I use their body scrubs like
crazy I have like eight bags of them
under my bathroom sink right now but
these are their Olympics foliate errs
and so it's like a coffee sugar scrub so
this is just like the original coffee
one and then I also have this one which
is cherry one I think this is like newer
because they just sent this to me it
basically just smells like a cherry Icee
I like to put these on before I start to
do my makeup just I'll like put that on
exfoliate my lip and then I'll put my
lip product on
I don't feel like getting that and then
this product that I have right here this
I'm going to talk about this product
specifically but also the product in
general which is just liquid bronzers um
and I'm not talking about using them for
bronzing and contouring with my fake
tanner I don't put it on my face so a
lot of the time I'll just have like a
line here of like it's tan and then it's
like the color of my shirt off here this
is do the hoola from benefit what I'm
having my no makeup days it definitely
looks weird having two different skin
colors but if I don't want to like throw
on foundation then once you throw on
foundation then you're tempted to just
do a whole face of makeup so this is
what I typically do is I just take a
liquid bronzer and I'll just swirl that
around or sometimes I'll just Pat on
with my fingers and it just evens out my
skin tone but it doesn't give any
coverage this one is actually like a
matte one so it just kind of like dries
into your skin and looks like as if I
would have just put my fake tanner on my
face um but some of them that I have
have like glow in it which is really
nice so it's still like your like
highlighted and fresh so those are all
of my current and just forever go-to
