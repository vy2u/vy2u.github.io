alterations for my dress
so we just um got a David's Bridal where
is it
David's so he's got a David's Bridal um
I had to get my dress altered because
the back zipper to my dress wouldn't zip
up all the way um so we're like
shortening the zipper but I mean it's
kind of like a good thing because it
gives me more like an open back to my
dress anyways and right now we're gonna
go get lunch and when you do oh we're
going to Marshalls training outside
currently look hope it doesn't rain on
prom okay so we're in Marshalls now I'm
trying to look for stuff for my room I
have a couple things I need to get by
the way don't mind my tanner as you can
tell like my body's different color than
my face and it's really patchy I'm
actually getting a spray tan tomorrow
for prom set out look nice and glowy but
I need to find a rug but they don't have
any rugs here that are the right size or
the right color
I seen a plain white rug I don't know
what's so hard about that I'm pretty
sure we're gonna go get something to eat
right now because I'm starving today she

like silk robe that says gorgeous on the
back so from Marshalls I got like a
bunch of pillows
