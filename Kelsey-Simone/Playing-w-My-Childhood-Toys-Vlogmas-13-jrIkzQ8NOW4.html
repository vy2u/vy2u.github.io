if you can see go package over there we
have a couple of packages um actually
before I get started can we talk about
how cute that I am Gaea sweater is if
you guys saw recently I did like a
little haul and I'm G sent me this
sweater like scrunches at the bottom so
pretty I love so anyways I went on this
little nostalgic moment with my mom and
I went on eBay and Amazon and I found a
ton of my old toys from when I was a kid
I thought it was a good idea to buy some
of them at first I wasn't even thinking
to do a video about it I just like
wanted them um but then I was like hey
I'm doing vlogmas this would be kind of
like a good idea so I have a bunch of
them over there they're not very like
basic toys either like something
everybody had like Oh a Tamagotchi like
I never even had those in the first
place but some of these you might have
never even heard of or had before some
of them you may have so the one that's
in the box I honestly don't even
remember what it is um so yeah that'll
be fun I think I'm gonna start with this
because this is something I know a lot
of kids did have this was like super
popular in my day do you guys remember
these they're called pixel chicks I had
so many of these they were like it's
like a little virtual little girl so I
don't know if you could see that there's
like a little girl and you can flip it
and then shall I go upstairs and you can
like tell her to do stuff and this was
my favorite one this one has like the
hair salon and the pet shop in it yes
mom I'm getting a facial
oh my god I'm broke she can't get a
facial because we don't have enough
money oh wow Alice she only twenty
dollars oh you have a lot of them still
in boxes I know
so do that one oh my god okay this one
hot rod this for a second this was like
the staple of my childhood like when I
think about my childhood toys like this
is the first thing I think about I don't
know if you guys remember this it's my
scene it was like a weird version of
Barbie I
they leave don't even make them anymore
like it's discontinued by little kids
writing all over it it's like whoa you
get there's like a background my scene
fashion notebook oh yeah they give you
like examples of outfits these are like
if you wanted to go to the beach yeah
you'd have my background little
backgrounds here's like a little city on
the beach you have like a picnic in New
York how sorry Nancy
oh yeah this is like the health party I
remember this this Mar be good we're
going to the beach so you stick Jessica
right on there and then you pick her
outfit and as you can see there's tons
of clothes everything is really ugly
look at this skirt who would wear that
that's so gross
well Kelsey you remember these this was
the 90s yes oh these pants are cute we
got some like red trousers party this
don't fly back in the nineties ooh we
got a bucket hat we have a new red wing
does she have a bathing suit where's her
bathing suit girl don't think either no
party this is I put these jeans on
they're like vintage little rolled
Levi's jeans with the bucket hat in the
bucket hat in the bra top oh she started
the book the book oh yeah okay so you
remember those what were they called the
scholastic like book marathons these
were the only things I would get and you
would yell at me because you would want
me to get like big reading chocolates
and I would refuse to get them and I
would just buy these the Coke or Pepsi
books and you basically just like answer
tons of questions
look how like Avril Lavigne the theme is
do I love or hate dodgeball
have you played that oh yeah in school
we were forced play dodgeball I hated
dr. ball yeah well I love how much you
know about me Mom you fake fan what was
the last game I won all of them good
answer thank you yes yes do you ever
what it was from the last time I mushy
that's happened before but yeah
we'll say sushi the last time is from a
turkey remember that oh yeah no I don't
want to call names but I went to a
friend's house and she tried to kill me
well you do that the next designer
working
able to play this on camera because this
goes to your TV what you're gonna show
them the pictures in the back wow I was
such a hardcore gamer we should doing
YouTube let's play so basically I didn't
actually even like remember having this
I saw a picture of it while looking for
another toy and I was like oh I used to
have that yeah so basically what doesn't
even do I don't even remember so you
plug this into your TV and you build
outfits and you would send your models
down the runway I remember that you
could make your own like magazine cover
you can design it yep what this is
actually like low-key kind of read I'm
excited about this one the most we'll
just get something we could actually
play like now like I'm actually excited
to put it so Kelsey had this game we got
it from the goodwill so back in the day
when I did have it it was broken so I
would just like play at my own way like
we made our own rules and our own way to
I never wanted to play this game with
you she would never play it with me show
than wine so it's basically well first
of all you have to set it up and sang it
up setting it up takes like a good hour
it's basically like monopoly so it never
it's like there's no ending to this game
it's like monopoly but instead of buying
property you like it's a malls do you
like invest and buy the stores in the
mall but also I kind of remember I don't
even know exactly how it works but you
had like a shopping list and you had to
like complete mm-hmm the shopping list
yeah before anybody else did I think
that's how it worked
look how cool this is it's like two
stories like you build it and it's like
a two-story mall it's the coolest thing
ever
highly recommend and here's the money
mole man oh my god here all the credit
cards oh this bring back memories this I
don't know what
that's enough ah I know what it is I
ordered it oh my god okay these things
these things I hated them so much
because I couldn't do it it was so
difficult you remember that I would try
so hard to make it look like the cover
and I couldn't like it was so hard but
you basically it's like a build-your-own
thing used to love yeah I loved it but
it was hard now I would get frustrated
yeah I remember this this is the exact
same thing that I had bags
does anybody who's been played with and
so everything is like lines in it so you
can like click them all together look at
that what the heck this is what their
face is like that's so terrifying I'm
pretty sure these um terrified me as a
chakra to make one kebab this is my dude
okay put your hand behind it you guys do
it like that with a beauty guru so they
can see it if the Sun is too bright can
you see mine so those are all the toys
