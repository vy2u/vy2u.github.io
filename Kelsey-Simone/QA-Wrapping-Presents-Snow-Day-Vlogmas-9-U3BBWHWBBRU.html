Christmas presents so I need to wrap
them so I was like that's cute Christmas
Eve log miss content as well as I wanted
to do it while doing some sort of like
Q&amp;amp;A sort of thing so I did tweet out for

this gold glitter one and then we have
this white one with gold stars we have
this print and then a gold like polka

green and then these are our stuff for
like making bows glitter one another
glittery one we have this one with
little like white snowflakes and then we
have this glittery one so yeah oh and
then these are the tags they're like
gold glitter and white for the tags so
yeah tons of cute stuff we're just gonna
wrap these presents and we're gonna
answer some questions so I have you guys
propped up here on a candle the first
question that I have is how do you like
your eggs and how toasted do you like
your toast I like my eggs over easy or
is it easy over I think it's over easy I
like them over easy and then
or how do I like my toast how do you
answer that like medium toastiness I try
hey hey oh my god hon you gotta see this
this looks really good that looks good
right kind of I already need a break
okay this question just says do you like
pierogi like singular pierogi just what
is one pierogi not even multiple um I
mean yeah dude I I do
fav pieces in your dressing like how am
I supposed to answer that ranch oh no
I'm so sorry okay I'll pick okay if you
weren't doing YouTube what would you be
doing instead that's a good question if
I wasn't doing YouTube I would either be
a very very I've said this before
over-the-top very glamorous wedding
planner um I have this weird like
infatuation with weddings and then also
I would like to be an interior designer
that would be really cool yeah but I
honestly I love working in the fashion
industry that's why I got into YouTube
was because I wanted to do something in
fashion but yeah I've always loved
fashion and I've always loved many
different parts of fashion there's not
one specific area of the industry I'd
want to be in like I love everything I'd
love to be visual merchandiser I'd love
to be an editor-in-chief of a magazine
I'd love to be a designer um and make
clothes I'd love to be a stylist like so
many things sounds fun to me in fashion
you can tell which presents under the
tree I have wrapped in which ones my mom
have wrapped because mine are just a
really crapoly wrap ones do you see this
that looks so bad can you do a nerd EQ
and I also what's your favorite doctor
on Doctor Who honestly I feel like the
eleventh Doctor is probably my favorite
but I also do love the Tenth Doctor I
have a very emotional connection to both
of them you can't even tell them that
it's a bow it doesn't even look like a
bow favorite vine um
I love mine I honestly I love vine vine
was definitely my favorite thing to ever
happen to the Internet um someone
literally just texted me to stop
blocking the month snapchat I have like
a bunch of here it's hard to pick like
one specific vine that I like like
there's so many going in my head you
probably asked me this question because
you've seen all the like vine references
in my vlogmas no you think you're ever
going to change your hair color if yes
what color so fun fact I do actually
plan on changing my hair I was going to
wait till the summer to do it and then I
was facetiming my friend and he kind of
convinced me to just suck it up and do
it now cuz I was really scared because I
just don't know how to look I'm not
gonna show you guys or tell you what I'm
doing because I want it to sort of be a
surprise to you um but I definitely
obviously you will see it once I do it
like like what kind of question is this
if you are anytime of the day what time
would you be how is put 1:30 how am I
supposed to answer that if you are
anytime of the day what time would you
be I don't know that so this is your
weird question I love you guys honestly
you're the best
how many piercings do you have right now
I only have two um each in my holes each
yeah okay that's English um each of my
earlobes have holes I don't know what
I'm trying to say right now I have my
ears pierced that's it I have my ears
pierced
I used to have six I used to have my
ears pierced and then I had the ones
like right on top so I had like two down
here and then I had both my cartilages
pierced but both of my cartilages got
infections so I had to take the earrings
out and they closed up and then the ones
down here when they were freshly done I
took out the earrings too soon and then
forgot to put new ones back in so they
closed up but I do actually plan on
probably even later this week so I'll
take you guys with me re getting these
and maybe even one of my cartilages like
redone again because I really want them
back I was really sad when they closed
up another one of the questions is three
things you love unconditionally besides
your family pets and your friends the
Father the Son and the
like I said earlier I do plan on going
to New York
so there's actually gonna be two new
york vlogs like I'll obviously be
vlogging this weekend when I go mainly
just because I have a business trip to
go to so I don't really know what else
is going on besides then we're just
gonna hang out with some family go to
some nice dinners sort of thing and then
um the next following weekend I'm going
with some friends and we're going to
Rockefeller Center we're gonna have the
whole classic like we're gonna go
shopping and Soho get hot chocolate the
whole Christmas in New York sort of vibe

can tell obviously these really
professional beautiful looking ones or
ones that my mom wrapped I wrapped this

getting kind of hot in here because the
lights that I'm using it's really dark
so I had to have like my softbox lights
