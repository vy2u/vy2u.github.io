channel today I'm gonna be doing one of
those recreation videos I've seen tons
of people recreating either celebrity
Instagram pictures or their friends
Instagram pictures and I thought what if
I did this Kelsea style and I recreated
some vogue cover photos you guys may
know I'm definitely inspired by Vogue I
mean Vogue is an icon I've recreated two
of their YouTube videos already I've
done the 73 questions video and I've
also actually my last video it was was
one of their recreations of sort of like
when they have the celebrities get ready
in the bathroom so yeah I just thought
it would be fun to recreate some of
their covers I chose three different
covers oddly enough none of them are
actually the American Vogue covers that
you know I would see they're all
international which is pretty cool
I'll show you obviously the covers I'll
recreate on the screen I'm going to be
showing you guys behind the scenes of
everything with what lenses I'm using
what settings my camera is on what we do
to edit it because editing is such a big
part in this um it really did do the
final transformation to bring it to look
like the real cover the first vote
covered that recreating was the hardest
and also my favorite to do it was the
hardest just because trying to get that
exact background of where she is was
really hard to find but it was also my
favorite just because this cover was so
beautiful when I saw it I was like I
have to do that one this cover I don't
want a hundred percent know what country
or language this is
I think it's Russian I could be wrong if
you do know what country this is what
language this is I would love to know so
leave it in the comments below so what
she's sitting on looks like it's like a
marble top I have this same sort of like
white banister in my backyard but the
top of it isn't like wide enough for me
to sit on top of so we ended up going to
a public part it was like a stone wall
that was definitely wide enough for me
to sit on it there were trees in the
background the lighting was good so
everything was sort of perfect it didn't
have like the white beams at the bottom
but I mean we totally made it work so
yeah I sort of liked vlogged a little
behind the scenes when we went out to go
take the pictures so I'll show you guys
that so there's bells going off now I
have these two bangles which were as
similar as to what she was wearing as I
could get I'm not wearing a necklace
just because I had nothing even sort of
like hers so we're gonna see my mom said
that I shouldn't wear a necklace and
that we should just like Photoshop hers
on I don't know if that's gonna work but
we're gonna try I was gonna recreate the
hair we're just gonna like slick it back
so for the outfit she's actually not
wearing a shirt in the picture which I
didn't notice that at first but we just
kind of figured that out so I have just
like a nude tight like strapless top and
then I have the same black those pants
mine have a slit in them but we're just
gonna try to like keep it closed yeah
she's barefoot so I'll take my slides
off just feels nice oh yeah it smells so
good we're using the way the way
finishing cream to sleep my hair back I
think we got it so right here so far are
the ones that we've got of some of
course we're gonna add some more
lighting effects in the back because her
background was a little bit brighter
than ours like we have more greenery so
here we have the pictures side by side
as you can tell we have some differences
to do with brightening up the background
changing my skin tone a little mix hers
is a little bit warmer than mine and
some minor differences I think we're
gonna like crop the base of the thing
out yeah first thing I'm gonna do is
that I'm gonna position you more towards
because there's not much room above her
head room right so what are you doing
right now don't mean you're pasting this
down yeah so my skin we're turning it a
little bit as you can see we're
darkening it don't worry we're gonna
make sure it doesn't look crazy and then
we're also gonna work with the tones
because hers is really really more like
brownish green toned where like mine is
looking a little bit like pinky orange
right now right
so I'm just taking down the orangey
tones you had here and bringing them
more to a realistic skin tone and I'm
just lowering the opacity okay so now
we're whitening the background more as
you can see almost like the whole top of
her picture is completely white so we're
gonna take out any bit of red tones from
the trees and just really whiten the top
of the image what I did was I took the
gradient tool changed it to white and
instead of the circle I picked the line
tool and I drew marks here the line here
I just left it that way and I erase
whatever did touch her head and we got
that
so yeah they sort of loud wheel all out
the background background a little bit
and I might even just drop that down a
little bit more yeah that looks a little
bit more that's crazy but yeah it's the
top of her image is like pure white now
one of the bigger steps were trying to
cut out the necklace from her picture
we're gonna see this work yeah we're
gonna see if it works it may not but
we're gonna use the lasso tool to take
her necklace and try to place it on to
me
actually I do see one more thing okay so
you see how the blacks in her pants kind
of have like a yellowy hue like ours are
like really dark okay so you're gonna
sock the color she's black
you wanted to effect like right there a
little bit less right there yeah that
looks good
you know it's good too and for me to
just write me and down there yeah bring
it down here since it's not really
marble
you
the second cover that we have is
actually a Spanish book and this has
Adriana Lima on the cover this one was
very simple with the background because
she just sort of standing against a
plane like white textured wall which in
the park that we were out there were
tons of them there so we just shot on a
plain wall there or here this is the
wall I think we're gonna shoot on for
this picture and then it pulls at the
end I'm gonna pull this down in a little
time that's good yeah this is the camera
we're using we have 250 millimeter lens
here you go I'm sort of like pulling
this down it looks like and then I'm
bending over cut at you but like chin up
so we've got a couple different shots
but I think we've got one of them okay
so now oh dang I just noticed my hair is
going to like the opposite side it is
I'm saying but it's okay well just like
flatten it out a little bits mine's like
way to Phuket in Salinas for retouching
purposes I have a saved action it's
actually called frequency separation
which gives you the most natural retouch
skin look it actually has texture so I'm
running the action I'm gonna brush it
all over her face okay so we're sparing
you the time of all the long process but
basically so far what we did was the
smoothing of the skin and then the skin
tones so we tried to even out my
blotchiness and just sort of match the
colors with her colors then what I did
next was try to add a little bit of an
artificial like a shadow on the cuñado
at this point I'd look out okay so
what's next so Kelsey said here so let's
go ahead and do that and this is the
easiest way I like to do it I'm gonna
want to filter my liquify tool I'm gonna
grab the very first one that Lloyd a
pointer finger cuz it's sort of the
smush don't ever go to my think this
much I'm gonna be my brush size and
that's pretty good right so that I just
kind of pack that baby down a little bit
ya want to shake and actually we can
sort of like pull the out pull in and
then one more thing
oh that yeah that looks good add the
little bit of green I'm gonna go to
filter noise add noise
by default it normally hits 210 but I've
been working earlier so now it's at
where I left it laughs which is a 4.8 if
you scroll this down and you can
minimize if you like that or not and I
think I like that 4.8 is safe do you
want more made me alone okay that's
right that out to seven yeah seven is
good alright so just roll in yeah just a
little bit yeah that looks so good
the third cover that I have was
definitely the easiest cover of them all
this is a Japan vogue and this has
Gisela on the cover and it's just a very
close-up framed beauty shot I was
attracted to this because of the
freckles that she has in the picture
it's very barefaced just very clean
natural beauty since there's not much to
the background we just shot this inside
the room that I'm in right now against
the white wall there's really pretty
natural window lighting in here so it
was very easy very simple to shoot it's
in black and white so the coloration was
very easy to sort of recreate she just
sort of has like her hands on her face
and then like a little strand of hair
you can like a barely see right there
okay so we are now about to shoot this
cover this is probably the easiest one
we're gonna do it's very natural I'm
pretty much wearing no makeup no
foundation no highlight or no concealer
right now there's no jewelry in this
picture not really any hair look in this
picture as well so acts are just gonna
shoot it on this wall right here
see
culture
yeah obviously like it's really far away
but we're gonna crop into it so that way
we don't have like the distortion of the
lens so we're gonna crop into own
Photoshop so look better but I think so
here we have the Japan cover so far all
we've done is crop into it and then we
tilted my face slightly more so that
would be the same sort of angle as her
so the first thing we're gonna work on
is getting the same sort of black and
white filter going on and then from here
we sort of want to maybe play around
with the filters that gives us the best
optimal look like that journalist um but
you want to look at our darker yeah so
we can play with the sliders here I'm
gonna just go ahead and use the clone
tool and grab a pretty decent sized
brush holding the option button down
click and then just start painting away
anyway alright so a little lip highlight
I'm just cool right in there so now she
has me click on this picture she has a
good bit of green in the picture mm-hmm
I feel like all magazines do that this
sort of has that nice magazine in one
finished look so we're gonna go into
noise tell me how much sharpening is
going on so I'm at five and normally
like around ten to twelve that looks
good that looks good for this picture
mmm yes she is like a lot in her picture
so those are the three boat covers I
recreated I'm really really happy with
how they turned up you want to recreate
this video of me recreating boat comfort
that would be really cool I see tons of
you guys recreating my pictures which is
the coolest thing ever make sure you tag
me in them so that way I can like see
them and like them because I think
that's always fun to see people recreate
my photos it's so cool if you want to

me to do maybe even a part two of this
video that would be kind of cool give it
