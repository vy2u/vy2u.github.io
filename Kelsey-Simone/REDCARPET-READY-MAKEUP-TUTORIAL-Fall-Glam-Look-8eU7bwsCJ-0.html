to be doing a makeup tutorial which I
haven't done one in so long I saw some
requests on my Instagram that I should
do the look that I wore to the Streamy
Awards which I thought was a really good
idea cuz I normally don't I even really
no makeup at all or like a very minimal
amount of makeup and it was like a full
glam look I have all the same products
here that I used brushes everything so
you can just either know how to recreate
the look or just have fun watching me do
it by the way don't mind this I have a
little battle wound I wish I had a cool
backstory for it but I just burnt my
hand with a curling iron so first I'm
going to start off with moisturizer this
is by far do you guys know I've tried so
many by very far my favorite moisturizer
ever this is the fresh and vitamin
nectar moisture glow face cream but as
you can see like I cleaned the jar so
instead I'm gonna be using my first
Saudi oil this is the rose gold elixir
24 karat gold infuse Beauty oil which is
like a facial oil but it has like little
flecks of gold in it which is pretty
cool
I have really dry skin so obviously you
can like skip this part if you like
super oily skin um but I kind of need to
moisturize my face before I do my makeup
also I'm just putting some eye cream on
this is also from fresh this is the
Lotus youth preserve cream my under eyes
get so dry and crusty like it will
actually like absorb my concealer
throughout the day it's really weird but
I just noticed putting eye cream on
first helped so if you have that problem
too highly suggest give you like a nice
moisturizing eye cream and putting it on
first
now I'm gonna use some face primer I
normally like always forget face primer
but because it was like an event I
really wanted my makeup to stay on all
day long this one's actually my mom's so
I just kind of stole it from her this is
the Make Up For Ever step 1 skin
equalizer base go I'm just gonna apply
this all over my face this is just gonna
help my makeup to stay on longer now for
the foundation okay now this is the
first time I've ever done this where I'm
mixing three things together typically I
wouldn't do that I just use one
foundation because I do have like a
favorite that is everything that I like
but sadly I didn't bring it with me so I
just mix these three things together
also at the time I did have some fake
tanner on which obviously as you can see
me Vil
into the curtains it has come off now
but I did have this stuff on it's like a
body glow and it gives a little bit of
color so I'm gonna put some of this all
over my chest I mixed these three things
together these are a little bit more
like pricey products you obviously don't
have to use these exact ones just use
whatever foundation you have that works
I brought this one to use which is the
Chanel aquatint but it has no glow in it
so the lady at the store actually told
me when I bought it to mix it with this
which I already had this is the sheer
illuminating fluid from Chanel so I just
sort of like mix this in there for glow
and then last minute I noticed it was a
little bit too light so I added like one
or two drops of my new dare from New
York of course if you already have a
foundation that you personally like and
it's your color of course use that so
I'm just gonna kind of like mix it all
on the back of my hand which I feel like
that's a bad idea but I'm gonna do it
anyways and then just put some on
sometimes I like to have fun with it and
paint little it's like face painting I
really personally just like using flat
top brushes I like the way it makes my
skin look this one is from Becca but you
guys know that I normally use the elf
one but it broke while I was in Cali so
this is just like my backup one this
probably is like way too dark for my
skin but we're gonna put some of that
glowy stuff all over our chest you have
my neck it's like all braids I'm like
darker and a lighter but I'm gonna take
my Natasha dunno in a glow I put
something on my thing just to sort of
even it all out
look at that glow it gives it almost is
like a highlighter on your chest next
I'm gonna move on to concealer I
personally just normally don't wear that
much I don't have many problem areas and
I don't have really really dark under
eyes but you can normally see a little
bit of my tiredness what I do for
concealer is I just put like a little
bit on the tip of my finger and then
I'll just like lightly Pat it only where
I need it just because I want to use
this little product as possible because
when you build up like a lot of product
that's when it starts to cakey and gross
and then I set it with powder I use the
Lara Mercier this is like the only
powder I've used I've transferred from
the yl one that I used to use too now I
only use this one I just sort of like
pack it onto my under eyes okay
intermission sorry I'm back of course if
anywhere else on your face gets greasy
I'd recommend powdering that area too
but there is no grease anywhere on my
face it is the complete opposite so I
can't really powder anywhere else except
my concealer so now I'm gonna move on to
bronzer I'm gonna use the Marc Jacobs
Omega bronze coconut perfecting tan this
brush I've been loving for bronzing it's
the smashbox buildable cheek brush and i
just kind of swirl that around in there
and then just go in at it i kind of just
follow like a line from like this little
like this little nubby part on your ear
to like the corner of your mouth i also
bring to cross my forehead and then down
into this region of the dome like by
your hairline some people do that i
don't never do that does that help in
any sort of way sometimes all go in like
a little circle or Circe
why can I not speak English circular
motions like that um I don't know why
just cuz it's fun and then also I like
to use this mammoth brush I've used this
in a couple of makeup tutorials before
this is from Marc Jacobs they sent it to
me with this and so I'll just like
get on in there and bring on in here
so yeah I'll put this it sort of gives
like a more wider range of bronze just
so that like blends out more evenly just
sort of sweep it over all the same areas
for Gucci's so now what I do is I clean
it up I'll take my concealer right
underneath there that was a terrible
line but I just make like a little line
and then I'll take like a brush and just
sort of like a blend that down and now
it's gonna look really like sharp and
precise which isn't cute either so now
what I'm gonna do is go back with this
brush with no added product on it and
just sort of like blend together so it's
more clean than before but like not as
clean as it is now I don't know does
that make any sense
I'm not a professional makeup artist
guys this is just how I do my makeup
last thing that I do for bronzer is I'll
take my little fluffy crease eyes shadow
brush and I'll go right under my lip
this just sort of adds like a fake
shadow under your bottom lip to make
your lips appear bigger my mom taught me
that so now I'm moving onto highlighter
the Laura Geller one is the one that I
use I love this Lauren Geller
highlighter named gilded honey this is
one of my favorite powder ones I'm going
to use this little highlighting brush
from Sephora I forgot to do this but
normally after I'm done like the
concealer in the powder and I'll spray
my face with a face mist this one is the
Mac mineralized turned water skin
hydrating mist it's not my favorite but
I do really like it they send it to me
and I've just been like using it my
favorite one is still the soap &amp;amp; Glory
one I really like that one this one's
really nice too it has a very powerful
spray I really like to spray of it I'll
put some on my chest too so then I spray
my highlighting brush a little bit
because I really like it to like soak up
the product a lot better um so I'll put
this on my cheekbones I bring it down
the center of my nose at the brush but
then I'll take my finger and do it on
the tip of my nose just because I like
it to be like really concentrated right
there and then I'll also get my Cupid's
bow with my finger
next we're gonna move on to my eyebrows
thank God my eyebrow routine has change
do you guys remember how he used to do
my eyebrows I used to do them I used to
fill them in so thickly I feel like I
have trauma from how bad my eyebrows
used to be that I like don't really do
anything to them now I have this clear
on Asajj your brow gel I just sort of
like brush all the hairs up normally
that's all I do with my eyebrows like
that's completely it but because it was
an event I wanted them to look a little
bit more groomed I have the Dior show a
brow styler pencil I just make like one
little line underneath the bottom of my
eyebrow and then I take this bully brush
and I just blend it I just blend it out
so that it's not like a precise line one
thin line all the way down like that's
it you see the one thin line and then I
just blend it out it pretty much does
not that much then I'm gonna add some of
my glossy ur boy brow this is like a
tinted brow gel I add barely any okay
we're back
so yeah I kind of don't really do that
much to my eyebrows it's a lot of effort
to get pretty much not a very different
result but um yeah it helps just like
the littlest tiny bit one more brown to
that just just cuz now we're doing the
face I'm gonna move on to my eyes I'm
gonna use the tartlet in the bloom
palette from Tarte is definitely one of
my faves and look how tragic that is
look how tragic that is I broke the
mirror when I was traveling to
California so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take my little fluffy crease brush
this one's from Sigma this is the e-40
tapered brush this is like the exact
same color as the bronzer that I use so
I took a little bit of that I'm gonna
put it in my crease just like back and
forth irregular motion and I'm gonna
drag it underneath my bottom lash line
but then follow straight up to the end
of my eyebrow here so it's gonna sort of
create this like
triangular end to my eyeshadow
that looks fine this can get very messy
for some reason I managed to keep that
pretty clean but if you're more Messier
like I normally am you can easily just
clean it up with concealer oh and I'm
gonna take a little bit of a darker
roller to add some dimension I'm gonna
use rebel easy right there rebel this
one's like a more like rusty or red
color I'm gonna pack that in the outer
corner and also sweep that underneath my
bottom lash line are we starting to look
crazy yet definitely but don't worry it
gets better for some reason when you put
on the mascara it pulls everything
together and it looks like 10 times less
weird this palette actually has a really
nice shimmer it's called a funny girl
I'm gonna pack that on the lid where
there's no shadow also gonna put that on
the inner corner and then drag it down
to the front part of my bottom lash line
so now I'm gonna move on to lashes I
didn't wear any fake lashes I just had
mascara I used the benefit roller lash
this has been like my favorite mascara
lately but I also wear this Chanel lash
primer first it seriously doubles the
size of your lashes put it on both my
top and my bottom lashes and then I just
do like my regular mascara on top of it
now I'm just gonna put my regular
mascara on top that's what it looks like
one hi Maura one eye without mascara
I'm very much excessively spread you
don't need to spray as much as I do
last but not least lips I picked up a
Natasha - no no lipliner while I was
there cuz I was like holy crap I forgot
to bring a lipliner with me so this is
in the color l5 it doesn't have a name
but it's just l5 is just a nude one and
then this is the same lipstick I use
this is Mac a girl's got needs it's like
this matte nude sort of brown lipstick
which I normally don't wear a matte you
guys know that and there we go that is
it this is my little go to glam look
when I was in California so yeah I hope
