channel today's video I'm excited cuz
it's a little bit different than my
normal videos of what I do right now we
are in like I guess you could say the
guest room of my house I normally use
this as a filming space like I'll make
little sex and everything as you guys
noticed from my videos I changes my
background like every single video my
mom decided to officially just give me
the room as a filming room she told me
you know I could empty it out I could
decorate it however I wanted to and you
know that makes me happy because I I
love to decorate I thought I was gonna
do this anyways like redo the room so
might as well film it I'm gonna take you
along with me on the journey of it just
basically redoing this room I've sort of
emptied it out there's like two things
in here so sorry if it's a little equity
this whole room is empty I'll show you
but um we're just gonna you know furnish
it decorate it I'll give you guys some
tips on how I decorate stuff of course
we're gonna make this very subtly
pleasing and a very beautiful room we
have two beautiful windows here as you
can see which is really great lighting
for videos I'm gonna place the couch
along this wall so that way when I film
I can just have great lighting from the
windows yeah I have like some of my
lights right there I'm gonna have all of
my camera equipment I think go in this
corner of the room and then I'm probably
gonna make like another cute little set
over there I think I'm gonna bring in
like my bold dressing mirror not a
hundred percent sure yet what I'm gonna
do
we'll figure it out first up that we
need to do is obviously move all the
furniture I obviously don't have a
little furniture in here like I'm gonna
bring some other stuff in and I have
this huge rug I'm gonna put down it's
just like a white furry rug I got from
home goods almost everything is from
home goods I mean I'll tell you guys
afterwards like give you like a little
room tour when it's done to let you know
where everything is going to be from
this is heavier than I thought it was so
this right here behind me it's a
magazine rack and it's actually supposed
to be up on the wall but the thing is I
change things around so much that I
don't really want to like hang it on the
wall with like nails because I know I'm
probably gonna like take it down
eventually command strips are a girl's
best friend
obviously but I don't think they're
gonna work in this situation okay so I
had to go get a snack so my mom bless
her
my mom just gave me this this was in her
office it's from Ikea she said she
didn't want it anymore
I don't know exactly where I'm gonna put
it but she gave me the idea that to put
this over there and then have the
magazine wrap like in the back on top of
it because it is skinny so I will still
have room to like decorate and like put
stuff up here you know one thing I take
into consideration when I'm like
figuring out where I'm gonna put my
furniture is I like to have different
levels of things that doesn't make sense
at all see how like the couch is kind of
like a middle flat level and you have
like all the wall like it goes up pretty
high but having something higher next to
it like having the different heights of
like you have the plant then you have
the couch then you have the taller
it looks more pleasing to the eye it's
kind of hard to like explain to you guys
but having like the height of different
things it looks really looks really good
together okay I think that looks really
stupid you know the concept was all
right but it it just didn't pull through
it didn't work I thought it was going to
I do like this though I think this is
cute I just think I'm gonna do do okay
so a little update this thing over oh
it's okay just set it right there
thank you Bob the Builder so um this
little thing over here had me stumped
sloped definitely isn't a word but it
had me so slumped that now I'm saying
stormed so I don't like that they
obviously like I said like that looks
really stupid I know so basically what
we're gonna do I have my big gold like a
vintage II looking mirror I'm gonna try
putting that there but we are gonna head
on over
- home goods which is my happy place I'm
so at huh so I don't you put the rug
down I have this little new thing here
it's like straw it's like white and like
wienie what is this called it's woven
you learn something new every day
so um yes it got a little it's really
cool you know I'm really liking this so
far we have the rug also come back up
here another thing that we're going to
do is we're gonna like reupholster the
couch because right now I just have like
white blankets on it so we're actually
just going to make it all clean I don't
want any like fur on there because I
feel like it's too much fur with the fur
rug and then tons of fur blankets on
here so this is the gold mirror that I
have I'm sure you've seen it in a
background of my videos before I've had
it in a couple videos so I did get this
on Amazon if I can find it again I'll
leave a link for it below for you guys
so if you want to get it too but I have
tons of pictures of these like on my We
Heart It which is my other I don't know
what number tip were on I haven't been
counting but another tip is have
inspiration I feel like the number one
thing that helps me especially when I
get like like I said slumped on I don't
know what to do having inspiration
pictures it definitely helps me a lot so
as you can see I just put the clothing
rack here I'm not 100% sure if I'm gonna
keep that there but I think I might I
have nothing else to put there so I just
got like a little pile of clothes very
aesthetic color I mean those are the
only clothes I wear anyways so I just
sort of pick things that I think would
go together
I think decorating a room with a
clothing rack and just like your clothes
very cute I love doing that I always
like my whole room I have like my cutest
shoes displayed on a shelf and like my
bags are in my little I love decorating
with clothes I guess it's just because I
like fashion so I like my room to
represent that so decorate with the
things that you love so I personally I
love having a clothing rack in my room I
brought this little striped dress
because I want the stripes the
pinstripes because they do have that
very beachy vibe that I want to sort of
represent through my room because that's
the vibe I'm going for they also match
really well with the pillow that I have
on
ouch so I got this one this one is from
Lulu's I wore this to Fashion Week for
like their little Fashion Week WIC tic
for hanging up jeans if you have hangers
like this where you can't like fold it
over the middle part I put the loops
I put the hanger through the loops and
then you can hang your jeans I was so
happy when I discovered that there we go
I hung everything up honestly this is
like a cute little place to take oh oh
TTS now ok so here's for now I think the
finished little touches of this corner
of the room right when you walk in from
the door so now all we have left is this
part of the room which is kind of like
the most important so it is actually
next day what I did do is we put up the
blinds for the windows we also fix the
couch so we have like a new fabric for
it and then I also got this I have the
magazine rack behind it which I think I
like that I just obviously need to
decorate it all and then I'm thinking am
I gonna put I have like my charger in
here for my vlog camera I'm gonna put
some of my camera equipment in there so
far I think this is looking really good
obviously I need to like decorate it and
everything I feel like the wall is kind
of empty like I do need something there
if this is a regular room I would
definitely put something on the wall
because I feel like it needs something
but because it's a filming room I'm
thinking it's probably smartest just to
leave the wall bare because you know for
filming purposes if I just need a plain
white wall to shoot like an outfit or
like to do like you know for like a
beauty background just like my makeup
just like a plain white wall then I
don't have to worry about like having
stuff on the wall decorating is the best
part the furniture is fun but that's
like the more stressful part because
there's literally so many things you can
do and then once you figure out the
furniture the decorating is the best
part and decorating I feel like there's
so many different things you can use you
can decorate with magazines which is
what I made in here you can decorate
with books you can decorate with candles
with flowers you can use like little
pretty ring dishes and use like your
accessories too
decorate you can decorate with perfume
bottles you can decorate with your own
shoes and purses you can decorate with
literally everything I have 50 million
of these this is just a plain marble
trade that I got from home goods it was
on sale for like $10 you can honestly
even look for trays in the kitchen
section that's a good little life hack
for you I have these little white pieces
of coral that I got when I was in Costa
Rica and I just sort of put them there
all of my vogue magazines tend to have
very colorful sort of covers so I'm
probably gonna use one of these two to
be like right in the front of all the
magazines just because these sort of go
with the color scheme a little bit more
and then obviously for the product tray
I just grab some products I might need
some more but I basically like to stack
them like height wise so I grabbed some
like taller bottles and I obviously have
some medium sized bottles and then
smaller things to go in the front
I'm gonna get more magazines and then
I'm gonna try to find a really small
base cuz I don't want anything too big
just something like really skinny and
small so we'll see if I can find that I
was even just looking in the mirror here
and this is something really weird that
I like to do is when I'm redecorating my
room I'll look at the same place from
different angles to make sure I like it
from every angle
I don't know but sometimes things look
good from one specific angle and then
they'll look bad in every other corner
of the room so I definitely like to walk
around the room and look at things
differently I know that sounds weird but
trust me it helps a lot I saw like the
back with like the magazine rack in the
table and I think it looks really really
pretty back there so I just brought up
this table and I think it looks
beautiful I think it looks so good I
brought this up from you're probably
like where are you getting all that
started you from I brought this up from
my gaming room which is in our basement
yes I have an aesthetically pleasing
gaming room don't judge me if you're
true oh gee Kelsey smells Rosie jutsu
freckles fan you would remember this
table because like two years ago I don't
remember how long ago but this used to
be in my room
I bought it to go with my room it is
from Ikea okay so you've probably seen
this one I've had in a couple of my
video backgrounds and then I have a
little Jo Malone candle this one it
still has its bow on it I haven't yet um
should I put it in the middle sure no
I'll keep it to the side that looks
better look how pretty that looks even
from this angle so I did just drape this
cream blanket here and I think that that
looks good I do have this like ribbed
white pillow but honestly I don't like
the mismatched pillows I think it looks
kind of weird so I might just do the
blanket I had this single little fake
rose laying around so I just decided to
place that there and then I also I'm
just gonna keep these magazines like
that because they will not stand up
they're too tall and I just place those
Bridal ones on their side so we are
officially finished well not like
officially finish I will
eventually probably keep looking for
stuff to add into here so it give you
like a little full room tour once you
walk in we have our little fashion
corner over here my little poof is from
home goods and the mirrors from Amazon
this Rack is from Ikea the rug is also
from home goods we have my camera area
over here I'll eventually bring my ring
light and all the rest of the stuff in
here this couch if anybody was wondering
is a really old IKEA model they don't
actually sell this little couch anymore
magazine rack is from home goods this
thing was really inexpensive I only
think it was like twelve dollars and
then all the magazines are just mine I
don't know my obsession is with trays
but I I love them so much so that is it
for this video I hope you guys enjoyed
watching me a rear enovate slash
refurnished decorate this the room I
know I don't really do videos like this
ever like at all but I think it's a
really cool concept because I honestly
love interior design so I wanted to sort
of mix that and bring it into my channel
