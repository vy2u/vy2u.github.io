first day of vlogmas it's genuinely so
hard for me to wake up in the morning
like my bed is very comfortable have you
seen it before so I've been holding this
off for you guys I'm really excited
because I would normally do this earlier
but I decided to wait for vlogmas so
that I can do it with you guys
well I always decorate my room for
Christmas you guys know I tend to have a
very aesthetically pleasing room I take
decorating my room very very seriously
so today I haven't decorated for
Christmas at all so today we're gonna go
to a couple of stores to pick up all my
Christmas decorations I also need to buy
like a mini tree and I'll give you guys
a little room tour as well once it's
done cuz you guys will like see me do it
and then I'll like show you everything
and also for vlogmas I'm gonna be giving
you guys like outfits of the day
obviously this is not my outfit these
are my bunny PJ's but
[Laughter]
that's my mom everybody I'm gonna do my
makeup and I even in focus
okay I'm gonna eat my bagel and do my
makeup so here's my completed makeup
look I don't know if I'm gonna put on I
just have like clear gloss on I don't
know if I'm gonna do like an actual
color because I haven't been doing that
recently so now I just basically have to
get dressed
oh you don't you hi say hi to the vlog
oh you don't see okay so currently this
is my outfit that I am wearing my
sweater is from Urban Outfitters I just
got it these pants are from brandy
melville the shoes are adidas Stan
Smith's okay that's Megan
okay that's good ah stop
so we're going to Kmart so all of this
footage is irrelevant because I did end
up buying this tree but then the next
one we went to I found when I liked
better so we just returned this one uh
yeah I'm crazy so moving on why am I
like this I'm looking for Christmas
throw pillow I'm so looking for
Christmas borrow pillows but early all
of them are so ugly like they're so
gross hey guys so we're home now I have
my tree I think I'm going to put it here
basically what I'm gonna do I have
everything I'm gonna put on my Michael
Buble playlist and we're gonna set
everything up so here's the tree I
plugged it in and lit it up that stuff's
obviously not staying there I'll move it
but these are the ornaments that I
picked up so I have the glittery boughs
the little Eiffel Tower
I've these and then my topper
this part isn't as festive as I want it
to be I'm gonna put more stuff here but
for right now I just have this is the
candle that I bought and then I put this
here even though it's not Christmasy
it's so really cute though then I put
lights all around this mirror which i
think is really cool so over here isn't
very festive and neither is my desk but
I still have to do stuff with this and
then I also put lights around this coat
rack here and I put like more wintery
pieces like I have like a lot more like
coats jackets sweaters this section
isn't very holly-jolly
either just stuck a bow there but I plan
on eventually jollying this up so I did
decide to move my tree over here I have
a couple of just fake little boxes down
here I have that one that I bought this
Chloe box of Dior and a club Monaco but
I'm gonna put like a taller one back
there because I feel like it's like
empty there I need like a tall one there
so and then this is my bedding I did buy
new silk pillowcases at Marshalls they
were only like $12 for a pack of two and
then I was stressing to find a holiday
pillow but turns out we have like two of
these in our basement so I stole one
from the basement couch and just put it
here because I thought it looks really
pretty but I have these two trees that I
bought this one has like a textured like
wooden look and then this one's like
yarn so yeah stay tuned for the upcoming
future vlogmas videos so yeah I hope you
