interesting I'm going to doing one of
those first impressions makeup tutorial
I resist áfourá and bought a crapload
of makeup and I've never cared before
it's all stuff that these are brand new
or who we wondered about or wanted to
try so I'm just going to do it a regular
glam makeup look and this is a sponsor
and I'm going to be hearing my whole
honest opinion if the product sucks
I'll be sure to say that PSA I am sick
so if I thought was really like snobby
or just really disgusting mess away
there's not a clean face the first thing
I'm going to do is moisturize so I got
this 11% this will write the little buck
new category at Sephora so there is so
many wishes I wanted to try but I just
think I just get slick whatever the new
thing was this is the truth here it has
vitamin C and all types of good stuff in
it packaging um I'll give it like a 2
out of 10 it's not the cutest bottle
like it's not something you'd want to
let this play a must orange is your face
so Charlotte apply just I'm gonna apply
it directly oh okay there's nothing
really that bad about a moisturizer I
use our left edges and randomly break
out into hives and I'm a deathly
allergic but so far so happening my face
is pretty sticky but most serums tend to
do that requirements aren't actually
requires they use different things so
the first one is the veil hourglass
primer this is little for filling primer
and then I just got like a highlighting
primer this is like a brand new NARS
collection it's the Charlotte whatever
it is so this is a baby green and my
gold bottle which I really like
it's got a lot of product in there and
this is our last mineral primer I only
bought this because the bottle is cute
so I'm hoping that pull through first oh
why are we clear I'm a little too this
this is a sultry the business is that I
need four fillings action I know you can
see this it's probably to be hard to see
but it is not mixing well with the fake
hair that I have on my face I face head
on right now and it's literally making
my fake hair like peel literally rolling
off with a that's fun
I didn't really think anything federal
bad this fast is the tutorial but okay
the primer make my skin feel really
smooth and I'm not gonna lie like I left
the primer but this is not something I'm
gonna wear memorize it can turn let's go
to glow to it because oh hey okay
pink tones normally don't look good on
me so let's and joke okay so far I don't
like to see there it turned my face like
pepto-bismol pink now my face is a
completely different color than I am I'm
not even well there's no love no there's
no love no love this at all okay then I
should not like I was hoping this was
really good because I love art and art
as they were my favorite employment and
happening with super cute and your water
faces everything so let's hope it'll fix
it la do not let that broker fear is one
of my favorite language that I use this
marker so I
other ones Assisi candles little soft
luminous foundation and if that doesn't
sound Boreas and I know it does yes an
action looks good okay so this is the
bottle super key bottle of the bottle
eight parts of packaging it's got a pump
are I was pretty picky with our nation's
because I like Mike Russell
so I'm hateful under foundation and it
doesn't thankful coverage so I hope it's
not yes okay Thank You Laura girl you
always help me out when she said Ken
lately machine Medicare wait a minute
because this is so lovely and I'm not
giving any props to that water pressure
at all new favorite foundation Wow okay
that's a correct yes Gothic my skin
looks really good I like this I'm
feeling it I might wipe it off and
freckles a little bit but I will do it
all the whole breast that's something
we'll need to know me as person was been
working fewer I love Bobby Brown
concealer so hasn't poopy snoopy Dame on
the topic I like I guess you just crank
not that it's not creepy it's pretty
light which if you don't like a lot of
coverage that's good because I eat a lot
of coverage is good tolerate out of them
super bad skin that I need to like cover
don't you stop be always perfectly
blended into my like foundation like it
looks smooth and flawless Wow yes okay
these two
neighbor better dynamic duo powder
powder I gotta back up softly
we're in powder now I love that we all
know the good champagne and I've heard
some base unity about this product
armed with the packaging 100%
yes a little bit intact and other people
are saying it what it has color to it
it's not translucent or at all it's like
darker than my foundation just making my
under eye the soccer which is that's
their socialist lighter fire whatever it
doesn't completely royally suck makes me
wanna jump on the nofa not to be
eyebrows over the pencil I picked up
some jars for our respective pencil and
First Instance Roger I see stuff is
Siobhan she mr. Rosen but I love this
packaging I think it's really cute this
is like that you just I thrown your make
up a greater curse and like Joe it's
really small really moving it doesn't
even come this holy brush NARS what is
happening are I liked you I hope you got
a good thing going on really I'm going
to start with this because I need to
brush my eyebrows the shape is kind of
weird it like gets longer at the end Don
I don't you know like this I think this
is a little favor like if you don't have
time to fill in your eyebrows this is
perfect for this super pigmented it is I
completely filling in my eyebrows and
okay let's just try this
this pencil super light when they're
done okay I'm going to use the face
concealer to clean up my eyebrow they're
looking better now that I cleaned them
up not terrible my brows have looked
worse before they look okay it's fun to
eat a little distressing I got this milk
like cream contour stick in the shade
blade this is the only shade combin
which looks a little bit dark it was
that to me I do not buy this one but I
haven't used it yet but this is the
merging of coconut bronzer I'm pretty
that is this is just like their matte
cream rather which are never screened on
this okay hold on I hide out but this
actually will
that's when it out a lot softer than I
saw changing the game this is actually
like a little lion get some more the
ethics is really nice it blends out
really that it's super creamy like
really easy to let that satisfied with
I'm going to clean it up with this baby
this is nice - it's super light and
scintillant
layer on top for my highlight I have
this fun gimmick from benefit I would
love for the summer especially when I'm
like super tan and brownie like I like
old head and this is the closest anyone
delicious actually
it's like liquid gold and like liquid
highlighters collectively they just last
longer and they're a lot easier is
lending love the face makeup it's good
it looks good it doesn't look good even
though I feel good now I beat our
chocolate in bloom palette which I
wanted to get this for a while a lot of
people who have this palette but I'm all
kinds palette and I'm just obsessed with
the colors the packaging is so pretty I
love the gold with like the flower petal
is multicolored oh my god these colors
are so gorgeous they're so pretty there
are some really neutral colors that I
use all the time with some like more
like plum you better colors they have a
really pretty champagne let are kinesin
sweet lot of paper and laminate like
smoky crease brush I think this shade
right here which is this mutual like
warm Brown this is the case for any
pants and I'm just going to put this
drama crease if the first thing I'm
going to say is the colors like they're
super buttery that we're going with this
sort of darker is called leader it's
like a little any darker color
and IRB and just a blended up into my
crease just to sort of like add more
depth and dimension to my eye I would
take this more flat blending brush also
sweeping up I think it's like champagne
it's super shimmery color and just oh my
okay
I don't know kinda leave a nickname but
yes this is so pretty
okay like a highlight color and look at
that then I'm going to take a pencil
brush limiter justice in the second
darkest color that's called activist and
I'm just going to kind of smoked it all
over bottom lashline for mascara I got
the Marc Jacobs ovett wash and I use
this one baby so Marc Jacobs not good
superconn packaging I really shape of
the brush as my lashes really well but
I'm going to give like two coats on the
top and bottom lashes so it's making
them rich super dark and wall but not
getting that much volume if not that
looks definitely one coat as you can
totally see the difference in my eyes
but I would look a little bit more like
intensity so this is what about Cheryl
looks like I'm your to code I feel like
it they look super pretty
one thing I like is that it did not come
at all but if I need to do is really
glamour it's not looking tan Shepard the
person really it depends listen everyday
good mascara for my list I've gotten to
your attic with Maximizer leaders
calculator clumping Lawson this one is
in the shade 0:06 it she's really nice
you know color again
she's packaging 10 is gonna packaging oh
it was really clear it was very little
like segmentation or color I like it I
feel like a little bit I like the color
even though definitely a lot of color
you know sometimes you just really like
a natural the color with a lot everyone
this is nice and I love this law flip
ever super pop it and then at the last
thing I have is a setting spray to cover
that illuminating sense right which my
standards are set high if your colony is
an illuminating tiny spreading in better
illuminating I can't hold it smells good
cuz I'm like so spit right now it's
super light it's not like a hearty spray
which is like lady spitting on you I
don't think even much illuminating let
me just spray in my hand notice I can no
sugar at all it should be water okay
aren't you see what they're saying yeah
I was really like glow to it okay so the
nominal are not locked up on me it's not
spraying anymore so that's great are you
okay that's it we're done
okay completed look this is the
finishing look love this skin and well
with the highlight in the glow of the
ROM this skin looks amazing I love the
look lost
I think the whistle really good the brow
could be better I've had better
eyebrow named the mascara could've ended
more like in the face you know but when
I'm Karen was good it was definitely
like good issues not like and I probably
go to favorite it's just like really
light but not for this I'm like still
slightly wet thank you guys for watching
