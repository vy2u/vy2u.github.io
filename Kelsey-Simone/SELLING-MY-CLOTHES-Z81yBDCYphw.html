channel where I'd rescue all the time
I'm selling my clothes well today I'm
gonna be talking to you about an app
where you can buy my clothes how cool is
that I downloaded it and I started my
own store um it's basically a free app
called depop that you can sell your own
clothes or you can buy clothes and other
people are selling I uploaded some
clothing and I'm going to be showing you
a couple of the pieces of clothes that I
have I mean I have a lot more than I'm
gonna be showing you leave each of you
like five pieces but um yeah go follow
me on that app and then you'll get
notifications when I post new stuff and
yeah so basically the app is really
really easy it's my favorite thing about
the app I don't have to learn the format
of a new app because it's set up almost
identical to Instagram so on Instagram
you have a feed and you have a feed here
as well basically you scroll through the
feed of people you follow and it just
shows you everything that they post um
and then in pictures they also have like
descriptions that talk about you know
the quality of the clothing issues you
the price of the clothes the size that's
in well you have an explore page where
you can search up either specific
products that you want to buy or user
names which my user name is just rosy
cheeks and freckles oh and then you have
your own deep pop shop so yeah I will
have deep hops link and then I'll have
my um Jun store do we call a store we're
calling a store I will have my store
linked below and I will have the D pop
app link below so you can go by myself
so the first thing I'm going to be
selling you guys saw like two videos ago
in my behind-the-scenes photo shoot
video if you haven't seen my behind the
scenes photo shoot video go check it out
I will probably have something on the
screen here but it is this really cute
so I've just done on the high-waisted a
light wash circle skirt with all the
like buttons down the front
I know these are super popular I love it
I think it's super cute I'm personally
just like not like a skirt person I
don't know I just like never find myself
like I let's get dressed and put on a
skirt like I just don't wear skirts a
lot so it's just something that it's
cute I have a picture too in it but I
mean it's just I don't know it's just
kind of like wasteful in my closet so if
you guys really want one of these I have
it and it
the size small so if your size small and
you've been wanting one of these mm-hmm
go pick it up then again I have another
skirt I have my little white tennis
skirt on this is not from my American
Apparel this is actually like an
original vintage white tennis skirt this
is I'm going to say like a size small to
medium because it has like adjustable
buttons like it has a just adjusting
buttons that's not a thing it just has a
different button sizes for like an
adjustable size they don't have any like
rips or holes in them like perfectly
fine condition I've worn them about
maybe at the most two to three times
then I have this hat which I know these
are like so popular right now little dad
caps or mom hats I don't know I got
corrected the last time I said both of
those parental names for this hat but I
have this baseball cap it's just light
pink and has the like you know drink
lettering and it says perfect on it um
so I mean I know it's kind of like weird
because it has like my name stitched on
to it so like but like I mean it's cool
you know so basically I know these are
really popular and I have so many hats
and I also have other pink hats that I
just don't need another one
um again I've only one that's like two
times for a picture I were to take the
picture on my depop and I wore in a
picture with my friend um so that's
about it but um yeah so cute hat for
sale then oh yes okay so I have this
dress girl you can slate anybody in this
dress by anybody I mean anybody like
this dress looks so good on the BOD I
wore this an Instagram picture I think
like around Valentine's Day um it's
basically just a ribbed like French pink
long-sleeve bodycon dress and it's also
off the shoulder so like super cute um
but yeah I've worn it again like two
times for pictures I've never worn it
out no stains there's no rips there's no
holes there's no nothing wrong with it
so then I have this beauty which this is
so cool honestly like I'm kind of sad
I'm giving this away it's like this
metallic gold backpack with like black
detailing on it as you guys know I have
a really monochromatic wardrobe and I
never wear like a lot of color so it's
just something that I never
I've never worn it before I just don't
commonly reach for it it's just
something that I don't know just kind of
sits in my closet it's just been sitting
in my closet for a while because I've
never worn it but I think it's really
cool so I decided to put it up there and
then the last thing I have in my store
you guys have probably seen this in
older like outfit of the weeks or
something um these are just a pair of
ripped jeans that I have they are just
boyfriend light wash is super duper
ripped jeans that I have you know how
brandy melville has those little like
butt slits other jeans and yeah they're
really really cute but this is just I
have so many pairs of boyfriend jeans
honestly I just don't need another pair
just to fill my store up I thought this
would be something really cute to give
away that you guys would like really
like to buy I'm see yet that's all the
stuff I'm going to be showing you but I
have tons of more stuff in my store so I
will leave my store and the deep hop
