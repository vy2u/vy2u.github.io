channel I hope your day has been amazing
so far today we're doing a spring trend
alert where I tell you the hippest
hottest coolest newest freshest fashion
trend these are all sort of spring
related spring is coming up it's kind of
still freezing cold but like spring is
coming up I'm just trying to keep a
positive outlook okay it's still
freezing cold but I'm in the spring mood
just we've got some really fun stuff
because I want to keep you guys looking
really cool because I love you and I'm
your mother I'm here to dress you
actually I'm gonna start with this the
first trend that I have I'm currently
wearing so basically these hats I've
been loving these hats I have a couple
of them in all of the vibrant colors
that I love to wear this one that I'm
currently wearing is probably like my
favorite one it's from lack of color
I call them paper boy hats I don't know
if like it that's what everybody calls
them and I just called a paper boy hats
I think hats are just a great way to
spice up an outfit that's not very spicy
if you know what I'm saying so like this
for example like I'm just wearing the
dress and I was like I need something to
make it a little bit more cool let's put
on like a cute little hat you know this
super cute printed one I just got this
from forever 21 actually you can look
like you sell newspapers at an
affordable price it's it's a win-win I
love these hats I think they're gorgeous
you can wear these year-round honestly
it's not like a beanie where I feel like
I'm only supposed to wear that when it's
really cold these you could definitely
wear these to the beach with a little
dress like this my next trend actually
ties into this now obviously I'm talking
about the trend in general not this like
one specific set but I'm talking about
those Chanel inspired because obviously
you don't have to buy a Chanel ones but
the Chanel inspired tweed matching sets
are not even matching sets just tweets
skirts tweed tops tweed jackets I think
they look beautiful
now when I say tweed I mean this sort of
like fabric and stitching this set that
I have here is from store Rhett's
obviously everything will be linked
below again giving Super Chanel vibes
it's a little
tweed skirts got little golden pearl
buttons down the front definitely very
classy classic elegant like vintage
vibes I love it so much and then the
jacket I think is the coolest thing
because it has a hoodie but it's got the
silk strings with the same pearl in gold
vintage looking buttons and you just
like button it up late bad or you can
like put a shirt underneath
I think these sets are everything right
now that sort of like Chanel inspired
tweed is coming back hardcore I love
when people are wearing this even Chanel
actually I saw their newest campaign and
like the British Vogue they're bringing
back like the tweed bags and we're
really happy that this is coming back
because I think they're so pretty and
gorgeous to wear sort of again and going
in the same direction I feel like all of
my trends flow together this is great
vintage bags are coming back vintage
designer bags specifically I've been
noticing a lot of designers have been
remaking their old bags which is great
my mom happened to keep a lot of her old
bags from the 80s and 90s so we still
have the ones that they're bringing back
now which are cool this bag specifically
is one that is super trendy right now a
ton of people are wearing this exact bag
and I didn't have to get it because my
mom kept it but less her fashionable
heart she kept this bag all the way from
maybe what is it like 80s or 90s this
was out I don't know I'm young yeah so
it basically has this like navy blue do
you're all over it it's got like the
gold CD for Christian Dior on the side
it is a gorgeous bag I love the little
ship I love these little shoulder bags
that's like another trend in itself I
could talk about that as like under the
arm bags
that's super like early 2000s thing to
do that actually wasn't a trend I
planned on talking about but totally
those are in right now the under the
shoulder bags which I used to hate them
so much I thought it was like so weird
because I thought it was like
uncomfortable to have a bag under your
arm which sometimes it is but when
they're like thin little bags like this
like really small ones I think they look
so nice this bag looks good with my
outfit right now I'm kind of like
feeling it also the old classic fanny
print this is again a bag that my mom
has kappes OG Fendi print was poured
throughout their new collection they
so many cute pieces with this print a
new Fendi collection broke my heart and
put it back together it was a very very
beautiful vintage bag all the rage right
now you know me and my mom's thirsting
skills are like on x-games mode like we
can thrift amazing stuff so for me like
in my head like thrifting vintage bags
is like an easy thing I understand that
it's not but like I feel like you could
definitely find the vintage bags for a
lot cheaper than like the brand-new ones
that are coming out next gen that I
picked out for you guys is again
something I've seen sort of from the
runway of Balenciaga just came out with
these pair of stockings they are just
everything I never knew that I needed
they are stunning I mean they're
honestly just stockings with the word
Balenciaga all over them but I think
they're gorgeous
I haven't worn stockings since my email
phase when you would like purposely put
runs and them and then wear them under
everything I haven't worn stockings in
such a long time but I love that they're
making a comeback I've seen tons of
people wearing them a little bit more
glamorously under dresses with heels and
that's exactly how I would style it I
think they're so pretty
I've seen ones that with polka dots on
them which are super cute I definitely
feel like this was sort of inspired by
like all of this see-through sort of
mesh trend like this for example like
the Dior sort of like polka dot mesh
which reminds me a lot of like the
stocking trend I think it's perfect
exactly in time for spring because I
love wearing dresses but sometimes in
spring it's still a little bit cold so
you can just put on stockings and it'll
look great too more trends left and I
feel like you guys were probably already
guessing this one was gonna be in here
because I've been wearing cheetah print
like crazy which is really weird because
cheetah has never been something in my
entire life I've ever worn cheetah can
definitely go the wrong way but when you
style it right it can look so pretty
the most recent cheetah pickups have
been these flowy pants they like cinch
at the waist which is really nice
they're super long and flowy I just sort
of plan on wearing these to the beach or
with like a little white t-shirt tied in
a knot you know definitely making them
the star the outfit keeping it very
simple because I feel like it's very
easy
you look a little bit over at the top
and wearing like a while wild print
getting its cheetah I also picked up
this which is perfect for you
Coachella hipsters you can definitely
you know that looks cute whoa that looks
a lot cuter than I thought it's gonna
love it that cow and I want it to be a
cowboy
that looks good yeah like I said I
bought this cheetah one it's like a
subtle touch hint of cheetah the cheetah
has definitely been on my hit list for
my wardrobe and I love that I've just
been like adding this in cuz I think it
definitely adds a little pop of
something you know also how could I
forget this look how cool this is guys
another thrift fight I thrifted this
vintage bomber white and cheetah jacket
I think this is the coolest thing I've
purchased in a very long time I'm very
proud of this thrift find for the spring
you do need a little light jacket
because sometimes it gets sometimes it
gets a little bit chilly and that's it
that is the last trend that I have for
you guys I hope that you guys enjoy to
this trendler I love doing trend alerts
I think they're super fun give this
video a thumbs up if you guys enjoy them

them sort of seasonally make sure to
