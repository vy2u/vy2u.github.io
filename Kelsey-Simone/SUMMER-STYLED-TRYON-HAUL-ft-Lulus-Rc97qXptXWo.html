going to be doing another try on haul
because I can't have a problem so I have
a box full of clothes and I'm going to
be showing you basically just Holly what
I got um how original
but actually kind of because I'm going
to be like trying it on styling the
trounce you can kind of see that what I
would wear it with so it's not your
typical home so everything that I got is
from Lulu's calm and literally loved
luscom they have really cute stuff so I
will every single item that I talked
about I will link like individually in
the description so if you want to check
it out you can check it out but I'm just
going to like dive straight in so the
first thing I picked out I literally I
was looking for these for like the
longest time um so it's basically these
I think these are so cute I'm obsessed
with these so they are just a really
cute black pair of heels I also have
these in nude and they just have like
the little furry Miss on the top I don't
know I love or I have so much like first
up and then they have two straps on the
top which my nude ones only have one
strap but the black ones have to strap
and I think it's really really I don't
know it just adds a little bit of
interest these are going to be like my
summer like go to heel you'll be seeing
these on my Instagram basically that's
what I'm trying to say oh I think of
this I did shoes I'm going to stick with
accessories first then I got a pair of
sunglasses and these are the sunglasses
okay they are like this I don't know how
to describe things they're like rose
gold and they have like this iridescent
tea seashell not seashell but I'll give
you like a close-up shot they're really
really cute they're different than all
the other song glasses I have which I
like
hello where did you go elf their fins
I'm going to kind of keep the trend
going with the shoes
so I got these okay so I got these these
are basically like fur pom pom earrings
and you just add a little bit of like
shebang
to the outfit I'm really bad with using
words today I literally said shebang
okay then I got a belt and this was
totally um inspired by a kendall Jenner
outfit I'll try to like put the picture
somewhere on the screen but I just
really like spicing up just like basic
just sort of like blue jeans and shorts
with belts and stuff like that because I
feel like it's kind of boring without
them I recently started getting into
belts belts have not been like my thing
for a while but I recently started
getting them and these just sort of like
snap and back and then it's just like
stretchy around your waist which I like
so it's silver and it just kind of has
that like little western feel to it like
that whole Coachella thing going on and
you know it's a good one to add to the
belt collection I'm apparently starting
now and then I got this like necklace
set so it comes with this part which is
my fave they do come individual so you
can wear like one or the other or both
um but it's like this choker and so this
part goes around your neck and they're
so cute and I love it and then it has
just to like contrast and add it comes
with this silver just a long one to go
like right down in the middle kind of
like the one they have now okay so I'm
going to move on to clothing now this
article clothing this was like oh I'll
get like this cute little like simple
black dress like you know it's cute
whatever I put it on this just is
literally my favorite doesn't the world
like this is my favorite dress that I
own right now like I can't express to
the love that I have for this dress you
don't hear this often there's just
there's just a key element to this dress
that I love so very much it's it's body
con it has pockets it's a really
stretchy comfortable material it's like
a tank top up top just kind of look like
that and it's really long and it has
like a slit all the way down the side
and like it's not one of those dresses
that I'd wear
I mean you could dress this up but I
kind of just wear this with like you
know some like white little slip-on
sneakers and like a little backpack and
like dress it down kind of thing
oh this this I love - oh my gosh I'm
obsessed with this so I love great oh it
looks like a regular gray tank top right
but it's not that's the back of it the
whole back is open and like these are
the little strings your arm goes through
and then there's one that goes around
the back of your neck it's just totally
completely open and I love that whole
open back trend I think it's so cute
well it's like a nice little vent back
there for you to breathe when it's like
a really really hot if this is kind of
something I'm going to take to the beach
to like put overnight a thing to or when
it's just like really really hot outside
and you know when you like it's so hot
you don't feel like putting on clothing
well now I only have to put on half a
shirt because there's no back then I've
got two skirts but if you watch my
youtube videos you know that like I'm
not really a skirt person I don't know
why I'm just like I got two skirts and
they're both they're both denim skirts
too so I got this one I saw one at Urban
Outfitters that I think was the same but
this was like way less than half the
price and it looked cuter so it is just
this like stretchy sort of line material
and it's like this nice blue color it
actually cute with oh it so cute with
this is really distressed and it's got
the pockets in there and I just think
it's really cute and then I got another
one in white but this one is a lot
longer and it also distressed at the
bottom and again it's really really soft
material and it kind of has some like
just stressed up here here the pocket
and it has a little slit in the back for
when you walk so that you don't you know
fall over and trip yourself then I got a
pair of jeans because I these jeans were
really cute and they sold it to me on
the model and I was like yes thought
they were which was really cute too so
they are just these like light wash
jeans they're just skinny jeans they
don't have any rips and like I really
need skinny jeans that don't have rips
and then because all of mine have
rips in the knees so I got these and
they are really high-waisted like they
come a boy pass my bellybutton which I
like you know just simple cute nice
quality pair of jeans oh I got another
dress I forgot about this dress ooh I'm
excited so this dress was a little
tricky to put on because like I thought
this had to go around your neck but it
doesn't it like drapes behind you so
it's like this v-neck I love v-neck I
feel like it just like makes my neck
look longer which like a weird thing but
like I like it so it just has these
stripes that I love and it's really long
again and it has a slit on the side take
your legs look longer because I'm
literally like two feet tall and then
the back is really low and like I said
that little like strap bow thing I
really like a black off the shoulder
shirt which I have like 20 of but this
one was a little bit different because
it's flowy so it is off the shoulder and
it's like ribbed and it's like a thin
material which is nice so if I want to
wear it in the summer I'm not gonna like
sweat to death because it's like really
airy and flowy
um and then see you can kinda like see
through it and it's just like really
flowy I thought that like 10 times but
yeah it's just I don't know really cute
and I liked it and like especially
styled like the belt really Coachella
style okay then we have this top cute so
cute it is long-sleeve but again it's
like that really really thin flowy Airy
material that on those cooler summer
days you still could wear no problems
you would be fine so it is just one of
those like a lace-up shirts like I don't
know just like a nice dressy blouse cuz
I feel like I don't have a lot of dressy
blouses um so this one has like that
little tie-up lace-up thing going on
which is nice to add to the collection
and then the last thing the last thing
I'm obsessed with this is so cute
so it's a bathing suit top and like oh
look at this bathing suit top it is so
cute it has this like bandanna print on
it which I love bandanna print just like
laces down the center and it just kind
of goes around the back and it's pretty
open in the bag
just have these straps and the string
that goes around your neck and it's
holter top to which I really like the
bottoms we paired it with bridges basic
black bottoms and I already have those
so I didn't get them the lights just
flickered um that's the cue for me to
end the video my butt is so compromised
