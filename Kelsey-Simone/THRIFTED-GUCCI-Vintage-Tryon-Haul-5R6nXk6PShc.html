channel today I am very excited for
today's video I recently went to the
third store and I had a very very good
run I found some amazing vintage pieces
some amazing pieces that I'm very
excited to share with you guys I just
thought I had so much good stuff I was
like let's just do an actual vintage
haul we're also gonna make it a try on
haul so you can see how everything that
some of this stuff I did do like a
little DIY already and a lot of this
stuff I plan on DIY so I'll also let you
know my full vision I'm going to start
with this blouse right here this was
definitely one of those eye catching
pieces that just kind of you know jumps
off the rack so this isn't obviously
your everyday blouse it's like this
sheer like see-through can you see me
but it's gold and it's metallic I don't
know if that'll show on camera or not
but it's not this metallic II shiny this
going on which is very fun it's actually
from Ann Taylor this is a size medium so
it's like a little oversized I already
envisioned this style so many different
cool ways I mean you can obviously wear
it like an over shirt like wear it open
on top of something I mean this would
honestly kind of be cool on top of my
dress maybe tie it like a wrap there's
so many cool things you can do with the
blouse blouses are very universal and
then I think I'm just gonna talk about
this right here my little stripy pieces
I'm noticing my style change so much but
recently I've been into pinstripe you
guys know I wear pinstripes losses all
the time and so pinstripe pants I've
been getting into as well so these are
these like high-waisted
they're super long just like flowy sort
of Beach pants they're from Liz 4
they're actually a boutique collection
which is perfect for me so they fit
amazing and they're like a very thin
sort of comfortable fabric so I'll be
perfect in the summer with this so yeah
I also just in general love like striped
pants the long stripes definitely make
your legs look a lot longer I think I
talked about that in a video before and
then I also got to pinstripe blouses pin
straight blouses honestly they're a big
trend right now and I know tons of
stores sell them when I go throwing I
find like 50 of them in every single
color so I would highly recommend if you
like the pinstripe blouse trend that you
should definitely know the
store I actually find them in the
dissection funny enough I do a lot of
chopping in the guy section so these are
both from the guy section this one's
actually from j.crew and I got it in a
size large I kind of like the larger
ones just because I think the oversize
it looks really cute if you just have
like a little white tee shirt and some
shorts underneath or if you weren't
aware it is a dress this one's actually
a stiffer more like dress shirt where
this one that I have is like a flowy or
like Beach shirt which I honestly like
these ones better and then this one is
from classic elegance it's more fitted
it like stops it like my waist so it's
like a nice like actual shirt size so
this one you can like you know tie in
the front like a little wrap top or you
can just wear it as an over shirt this
next piece that I have is very
interesting I found this in the women's
like business part where they have like
matching suits just sort of like a 80s
90s
classy office where you know this is
from actually Liz Claiborne
and it's just this button-up cropped
dress shirt or I don't know if it's
supposed to be like an outerwear sort of
table or if it's supposed to be worn as
an actual shirt I'm not sure it's very
very pretty I like it a lot I think it's
really cool so yeah I guess you could
just sort of wear it as like a bind up
just like a shirt with like a cute pair
of like mom jeans this would be cute I
found look how adorable that is um I
found this sunshiny yellow little flowy
romper I think this is the cutest most
adorable thing I've ever purchased with
my money um so it's got a button up sort
of top at the collar and then it cinches
the waist and it's got your little
button hole pockets I think this piece
is so cute I could not wait to wear this
I don't know where I'm gonna wear this
I'll definitely have to wait till it's
like a little bit warmer outside so I
had such an amazing find I was actually
looking again in the men's section I was
looking in the hoodies which is where I
find like all my like champion hoodies
and stuff like that and then I saw this
like greyish blue velvet and I was like
what's that um and then I started seeing
the GG and I was like what is that it is
this Gucci velvet like this blueish grey
crushed velvet jumpsuit so I have both
the hoodie and the sweatpants I got it
from
$14 now I'm not really sure if it's real
or fake I'm not gonna say either one cuz
I don't know but either way I'm still
happy with the find like it's still
really cool the sweatpants are like way
too big for me I do plan on wearing the
sweater I just sort of plan on wearing
it you know maybe like open another
amazing fine is a pair of Levi's shorts
oh gee vintage Levi's I always almost
every single time I go thrifting I buy a
pair of vintage Levi's I don't know how
I find them so easily
these came pre-distressed I didn't do
anything to them they were already cut
already distressed which is great
because most of the time I do personally
have to like cut or distress mine
because they look sort of like weird but
I love the color they're like a medium
wash they're not light wash but they're
not dark wash either which I like this
they fit really great they fit sort of
like slouchy which I kind of like that
because they're just like a lot more
comfortable and then I got these which I
have to give my mom credit my mom found
these holo pants well they're like
capris but I'm going to DIY cut and
distress them into shorts so they have
like this cool strap on the side which
I'm gonna cut right below it because I
do want to keep that um so it'll
definitely still be almost like capris
like they'll be pretty long you don't
have a lot of dark wash denim especially
in shorts so it's really great to have
these maybe I don't even know if I'll
cut them because I mean they're honestly
kind of cool and I don't have any capris
I might just leave them as capris I
might try to you know what we may be
trying something new I might keep these
we'll see I'll try them on and see how
lame they look if it's like not that
lame then I might just keep them I found
this skirt again in like the business
section where they have like all the
business suits and stuff so this print
has been a print I've been loving lately
it's just like this very high waisted
sort of long skirt it's like this weird
mid length I definitely have like a
matching jacket with the same print so I
think that that would be really cool to
like wear this with the jacket with just
like a cute little undershirt that is it
we've made it through the pile we
finished I hope you guys enjoyed this
little vintage haul I hope that maybe
