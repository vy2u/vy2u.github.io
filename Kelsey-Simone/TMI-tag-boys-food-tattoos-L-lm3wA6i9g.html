and I really want to get like a nose
piercing like not this is fake it's like
poop but I want to get like this side

like a bunch of pictures to get of them
together and I like assume they're
dating and also um Vanessa Hudgens and
Austin they are so cute what's your
favorite show my heart shows Doctor Who

Netflix down it's like the Australian
mermaid show like h2o it's it's good eye
Sawyer um your favorite bands um I like
that I do 25 I think by Seconds this
summer I'm not really like a band or
like artist type of person I mean I do
like certain bands and artists but I'm
more of like I like like a certain song
and like you know something you miss I
we did have a watermelon in my fridge
and it's gone now so I miss that
favorite song um what do you mean by
Justin Bieber comes out in 29 days and
it's not even out yet and it's already
number one on the Billboard tracks so
believers were kind of like slain right
now like the charts like literally these
like darkling you're number one and
we're not even out and I heard like 30
second clip of the song so I'm pretty
sure um that's my very song right now
I'm not pretty sure I'm very sure it's a
Herot song and you know it's gonna be
great when it comes out and yeah so yak
sign oh I skipped some questions oh just
one how old are you I am 16 zodiac sign
I have no clue because I don't really
follow that stuff quality you look for
in a partner okay
well no really the first thing I look at
is like a person's like style like the
way they're dressed and like their like
attitude like I don't know I like really
like that that made total sense I am
heavy I'm a Christian so for Christian
guys nice smile you know he's got to be
a respect your favorite quote my
favorite quote I have no clue I have
like a bunch of brand new codes let's go
check on my we harden and look for some
quotes that I parted
this I have no clue if my camera's gonna
focus on that but it says you know I'm
just right here yeah but I'm pretty sure
that's my favorite quote I'm loving that
one I'm feeling it I'm digging it my
favorite color will pretty much 94% of
my room is white so I'm probably gonna
go with white
most people say that's like a shame
though it's not like an official color
so I'd probably have to be like like a
nude color like skin tone I'm so I'm
sorry
louder soft music I'm definitely loud
music I don't really understand people
who listen to like soft music where do
you go when you're sad right here my bed
I sit here and I talk to my friends I
pray here I write my book like my little
journal thing I write stuff down I do my
thinking here am i crying here this is a
very special spot how long does it take
you to shower and see it takes me like
an hour to take a shower like I'm the
chair for so long I'll have like 25
steps that I do when I'm showering it
was kind of ridiculous but how long does
it take you to get ready in the morning
same thing it takes me so long to do
stuff I'm such a horrible person um
maybe it depends where I'm going if like
I don't really need to look like really
great um I can I can like get ready in
like 25 minutes but like typical like if
I really like I just have like I'm not
being rushed like I'm just going to the
mall I'm gonna look good like you know
again right about like an hour hour and
20 minutes thank you that's probably
move bad that's okay have you ever been
in a physical fight one time in the
fourth grade a girl came up to me and
homido sweep was gay and I punch her in
the face got attention
started I love myself
turn-ons ki and Lali just kidding um um
let's see okay sweat pants and
sweatshirts sweatshirts on boys okay if
you are like a vibe and we're sweatshirt
you go to like in 8.5 like that's really
good
that's too much like too much oh my gosh
like I just love when boys wear
sweatshirts in my pants I don't know why
I just think it's a really really cute
turn-offs um hmm when you're not funny I
guess I don't know just like things that
are like typical that like isn't cool
the reason I joined YouTube so I used to
talk to myself all the time like my mom
would catch me not like talking to
myself but like I used to pretend I had
my own reality TV show but I'm like
every girl in the world would watch it
and like I just like to talk about my
life and like I'd like being the shower
and be like so next I'm using Herbal
Essences like I do that why I did my
makeup when I was getting dressed like
it I like talk while I was getting
dressed and like I would be like okay so
today I'm going to the mall so like I'm
going to the mall with my friends and so
I'm pretty sure I want to go for like
you know the whole shorts like baggy
t-shirt look like I just like talk like
it was like an actual TV show like they
were like cameras filming me the first
of her youtuber I started watching was
jennxpenn and she wasn't really like a
beauty guru but then like after like you
know people on this side like I start
clicking and then I forget who my first
look official beauty guru was that I
like subscribe to it actually like but I
was just like oh my gosh they kind of do
like what I like to do so that I was
just like why not so yeah that's how
what are your fears my biggest fear is
dying before I get to achieve any of my
goals I'm very like a goal you little
person goal is not word we're making it
work right now I'm a goal Euler person
like I'm very like organized like I like
to write things down and like this is
this I'm very bad at sticking to it but
I like to have tools I like to like set
things I like to like have my life
organized and like that would just be
horrible because I have so many goals
and things I want to do that I haven't
done and things I want for my future
that like it would just subtly die when
I got to it but then like other fears
like little like things I'm scared of
like the asked like open waters
I just big like spaces and like outer
space like that scares me so much and
just anything in the ocean I hate whales
like you know whales oh my gosh I like
the whole little kid the last thing that
made you cry um yesterday and it was for
no reason at all girl probs last time
you said you loved someone well I say
love you telling my parents all the time
like my friends and stuff meaning behind
your youtube name okay so my youtube
name used to be benefit bar P 14 I made
that name in like five seconds and then
I hated it like five seconds after
because like it's like so basic so I
changed it to rosy cheeks and freckles I
don't know why I just thought about it
for a while and it was just kind of like
it it went it was cute and I was like
you know I freckles rosy cheeks and
freckles and then also my username for
my webkinz was rosy cheeks and then I
was just like rosy cheeks and freckles
that's cool last book you read I don't
worry books the last book I read was
probably like for a second grade book
report or something I have no clue book
you're currently reading just answered
that um the last show you watched Girl
Meets World
well evening my Jost so there was
nothing else on I swear last person you
talked to
probably
my mom she came in here and told me my
friend left their bracelet so the
relationship between you and the last
person you texted let's go check so the
last person I texted was Rachel we
filmed a video together she's on my
channel we found like the foreign candy
challenge and um she our relationship is
a long-distance friendship what is your
hair food Indian food it's so good oh my
gosh pizza like who doesn't like pizza
like everybody likes pizza
tacos I always move tacos are so good
who el Diablos has like the best salads
like oh my gosh and then also those like
microwavable like lasagna stuff shell
things those are really good a place you
want to visit I want to visit California
and Australia ooh really want to go to
Australia and then also ever since I was
like 10 I said I'd want to town my
honeymoon at Maldives and I still really
want to go there so last place you were
last place I was with in my living room
do you have a crush
I have celebrity crushes but I don't
have like like a real-life crush because
I'm homeschooled and everybody who lives
in my neighborhood is like hold people
last time you kissed someone um I
haven't had my first kiss
so I guess is like my dog or something
last time you were insulted
um I don't get insulted because vevo who
insult me what they say is irrelevant so
I kind of like don't even get it that
made no sense but last time I was
insulted that person watches my videos
mmm but you know they said it to my mom
which was kind of weird and my mom told
me and I was like wow favorite flavor of
sweet I kind of have no clue what
they're talking about do they mean like

therapies of jewelry um I like my
bracelets I've been wearing bracelets

kind of weird because I took gymnastics

years ago so like since three years ago

you say I don't think I sang song today
ooh I was singing the we like like the
theme song for a while favorite pickup
