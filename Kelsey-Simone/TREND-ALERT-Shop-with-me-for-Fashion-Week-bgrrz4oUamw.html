to be starting a new series called
trend alert so I want to really cool to
start a little series where I talked
about all the newest and upcoming
fashion trends Fashion Week is coming up
in a month and I've just been really
just studying a lot of like the trends
that are up-and-coming the first trend
is that I've been obsessed with recently
that I've seen that tons of fashion
influencers wearing tons of models
wearing many frames have been really
trending lately tons of people have been
wearing them I've been wearing them like
crazy I have like a little collection
going on because I've been so obsessed
and in love with them a lot of the ones
that I find people are making now and
wearing are ones that look like old
vintage designer sunglasses so the main
ones that I wear all the time are these
little black ones that I actually got on
like a side street when I was in France
for my birthday um they're really cool
they were like three bucks and they're
definitely probably my favorite pair my
most recent pair to my little collection
are these more ground frame brown ones
I've been obsessed with the brown for
some reason I'm not sure why because I
typically go for like black or gold
sunglasses but I really like these ones
these ones I got from ASOS online and
then also these are really cool I know
tons of people have been wearing these
sort of like cat eye shaped ones these
ones I got from Topshop and I'm in love
with them and then I've showed these in
a haul before but I also have these like
gold more square ones these definitely
have like a 70s odds that I love so much
I just think they're so cool normally I
always like keep them down off my nose
sometimes I finally just like look
better that way just coming out of all
the summer trends obviously sunglasses
are something you can wear year-round
the Sun doesn't stop shining in the
summer so these are something that we're
definitely going to probably carry into
like fall trends and winter trends and
I'm going to be wearing these a lot so
the next trend that I have is something
I really recently gotten into it took me
a while to get into then I actually
didn't even like this trend like at all
at first um so both wingback heels and
kitten heels or something that's really
in right now
I have these these are from ASOS so
basically a slingback heel has this sort
of strap that goes across the back of
your heel and kitten heels
have these like really little tiny heels
Dior recently came out with a pair of
slingback in heels that I'm in love with
they're the most adorable shoes but I
got these plain black suede ones I think
these would look really good with like
cutoff light wash denim jeans I just I
saw a picture from my we heart at page
by the way you should go check that out
of these and I just instantly became
obsessed with them also I have another
pair these are the exact same hair
chooses this just they have a higher
heel it would give you more of a dressy
look compared to the kitten heel which
this is definitely more comfortable and
other things that I have completely been
in love with lately is vintage designer
bags I mean of course like the newest
collections of designer is great as well
as a vintage designer is something I've
been in love with I've been looking on
all of these websites and I've been
going and boutique most of the trends
that we have now come from trends that
were trending back then like a lot of
this stuff with stuff from either the
late 90s or early 2000s super fashion
forward but you're also going to save a
lot of money buying a vintage designer
bag versus a brand-new designer bag but
also it's just a sort of like under the
arm bag which I never thought I would
like these like I never would have
thought I would get into this because I
like really long bag but I've just been
obsessed with these lately they look
really cute it's not as uncomfortable as
I thought it would be this is something
that was so poppin in the early
two-thousands like every girl ever has
these little bags that would go under
their arms and I don't know I'm just
digging it I like it I think it looks
really cool too the next high end
fashion trend that I have is fur which I
don't think there has ever been a fall
or winter in the history of fashion that
fur has not been in so everything here
that I have is faux fur it's not real
fur I have so much for accessories just
for bags for hats for jackets for
everything not only is it because it's
practical like it's going to be warm I
feel like it adds this like luxurious
look to your outfit so the first thing
I'm going to show you is this hat which
you probably seen in my last video
haven't seen it go check it out but I
have this little white furry bucket hat
and then a recent pick up I actually got
this a good publication though I haven't
even worn this yet but this is like it's
like a dark grey brown for me purple
depending on the light it looks
different colors to me I don't know
I'm crazy but it has a little gold clasp
and it's just this little furry clutch
which I don't have many clutches because
I'm a very clumsy person I'll tend to
set it down somewhere and completely
forget but this one was so adorable and
a really good price that I had to get it
it's like gray right yes it's like gray
yeah it's great for some reason to me it
has like plummy undertones but it's gray
which is yes see I'm not creepy
another thing is that I have is this for
a bomber jacket which let me tell you
this thing is the love of my life I'm
going to wear this every single day it
has a white silk lining which i think is
really nice surprisingly it's from
brandy melville I would have never
thought you could get like a heard nice
fur jacket from brandy melville another
fashion trend that I have been getting
really into that I've seen a bunch of
people then rocking is matching set
2p sets are very stylish and you look
super put together when you have a
matching set I don't know what it is
about it but I just do parents have it
just looks really nice also minimal
effort like you know I printed only you
don't have to really worry about styling
an outfit when you have pants in the top
that are meant to be together
but also you can sell them separately of
course like I have this set here that
you have to see it on my Instagram I
wore these pants like an
off-the-shoulder
black top everybody was asking me where
these are from I got this set from Free
People it's this rusty super flowy rib
to be set I love the flowy pants and the
way that they look on me with the
vertical lines they make me look so tall
legs for days and the matching the top
looks like this it has a little bit of a
turtleneck and the sleeves are like
super poofy and flowy and then they like
cinch around the wrist which I think it
looks really pretty really elegant I
love the flow eNOS I get so comfortable
another trend that I have is straw bags
you guys have seen me rocking this straw
hat is actually my mom I've been loving
straw bags lately asked to to show you
one I have this like bigger tote this is
more of like a beach bag or like a
traveling bag it's not really like a
purse you don't to think but I loved
with the straw look I've been wanting to
put a lot of strawberry room as well
lately I saw this straw pillow from
Nordstrom that I really regret not
getting but I'm definitely going back
trust me a gift that beachy vibe that I
know in sort of summary I still feel
like I'm very much going to be wearing
straw in the fall as well but then I
also have this other one this one I got
of the spring from Zara I'm not sure if
they have it anymore in store they might
have it online but it's this many sort
of crochet backpack that has the same
sort of deal with all the little studs
and chain it's super in I love this
whole straw sort of crocheted bag look
another trend that I have for you guys
that is so essential for Fashion Week is
statement shoes you kind of can't go
without statement shoes stay even shoes
or something that's so important for
fashionistas wardrobe what I mean by
statement shoes normally that doesn't
mean that it has to be like an expensive
designer shoe at all basically something
that's just a little bit different it's
a little bit out there it's not your
everyday shoe something that's very
trendy that not typically everybody has
so I have a couple examples here the
first year that I have are these that I
actually rocked a bit on New York City
every single person to met ask me about
these shoes they're from Jeffrey
Campbell but they are these black suede
lace-up heeled boots and they have these
golden pearl details all over the shoe
that I saw these and I fell in love and
I was like Add to Cart not only on top
of having statement shoes but
embellished shoes are really in right
now which also goes with my next pair of
shoes like Gucci Prada tons of other
designers have been making so many
embellished shoes I have these ones that
are actually from Aldo surprisingly they
are these completely rhinestone
white sneakers I haven't even worn these
yet because I'm so scared to ruin them
these are the kind of shoes that you
like frame or like you put them on a
shelf or something because they're so
just pretty these are the next peg that
I have I picked these up the last time I
was in New York they are these mule
which mules are also something I've been
loving lately but they have this like
gold link chain heel which is the
coolest thing ever I've never seen shoes
like this
I
I've been able to find anything like
this anywhere else I think they're the
coolest space and then I have these
these are a little bit more low-key
statement shoes you could technically
still wear these like every day plus
they're like really comfortable but it's
something that's not basic at all and
not a lot of people are going to have
this you know what I'm saying but I
definitely think these are going to
catch on these are the coolest things
ever I got these from a brand called
goods I've read so they are these slides
that have like Levi's jeans like vintage
Levi's jeans all over if you're really
crafty you could technically DIY them
yourself and I don't know how you would
do that I'm not a crafty - the last
trend that I have is the snakeskin print
of course again this is all fake
snakeskin it's just a print it's not
real it recently bought a printed belt I
have these filled boot that I've been
loving and they go with a lot more than
expected even though they're like a sort
of out there print they go with a lot of
the stuff that I have like I could
technically even wear it with this
outfit and I like that it's sort of a
monochromatic snake print it's just like
black white and grey which is really
cool
and then I also have this bag that I
actually got a Steve Madden when I was
in Miami they were having a sale so I
bought it in like two different prints
but I got this snakeskin one with the
chain and I love it I think it's really
cute again it would go with this outfit
I love the way it looks again anything
with this sort of print just looks
really classy it looks really elegant is
really fashion-forward and printed stuff
is really cool when you have more like a
basic outfit like this just to sort of
dress it up and make it look a little
bit different you know so that is all
the trends and then I'm going to show
you in this video I'm really excited for
Fashion Week and the fall in which is
fashion coming up because it's always
the best give this video a thumbs up if
you liked it because I do plan on like
doing maybe like a series of these I
don't know how often I would do them but
sort of every time I feel like there's a
bunch of new trends that have arrived to
