I'm gonna talk about it I mean that's
the total haul is stuff I'm gonna box in
the mail from the website is Apple which
is basically just online clothing store
they have tons of huge stuff everything
was like under $15 it was really good
price and they have really really cute
stuff like I'm really excited to show
you the first thing I got I literally
can't express how excited I am for this
like the whole box of cute stuff in this
I was like I just can't wait to get it
um and I even showed my friend and she
was like oh it's so cute and I was like
yeah I know so it is a two piece set
which is my first two piece sets so on
this is a shorts and like a crop top set
so these are the shorts they are just
white with like these really thin black
stripes I love like this little
minimalist print it's so pretty
and um they're just super flowy and
super thin so in like the summer you
won't be like sweating to death is the
crop top that matches with it and then
it is like a little V in the back of the
shirt and it has these two little
strings that tie and like a little knot
a little ball like whatever you're
feeling so it's really cute I love the
print of it you're definitely gonna be
seeing me wearing this a lot in the
summer warning you right now umm so many
IG pics with this plus it goes with my
aesthetic 10 out of it Oh almost forgot
to say a last time in my try on haul you
guys really liked when I put all the
individual links for every single like
product that I'm showing you so I'm
doing that again it'll be in the
description I'll have all the individual
links like if you feel on something if
you dig in it and you want to buy it you
can and then I'll also have samples just
website link and my links as well go
follow me is snapchat Instagram Twitter
blog and subscribe here to see more of
me I don't know why you'd want to but
like please I got this and I'm really
obsessed with it it's this gold it kind
of is rose gold in my opinion little
body chain but it's only one
it goes like around your waist in the
picture they had a girl with a bathing
suit on and it was like around her hips
and it was so cute I was like I want to
wear them with my bathing suit uh yeah
it's really can you put it with a key no
over your shorts I just feel like it
adds like a little like a zing and zest
to your outfit maybe don't know what I'm
saying anymore guys so um yeah I really
like it I thought it was really cute
Oh mm-hmm yes look
oh no words look how beautiful this is
oh my gosh is this nude backpack it has
a lot of gold detail on it which I love
gold and also have some black detailing
on it and it is just so pretty like it's
so beautiful I can't wait to its
everyday so I love backpacks because I
feel like they're a lot easier instead
of like having to hold like a heavy
purse on your shoulder like it's on your
back you don't have to worry about it
like it's just chilling back there and
it's really just great they're bigger
than purses I mean bigger than my purse
is so it can hold a lot more so oh my
gosh I'm really a little obsessed with
everything that I got these two things
I'm so happy I got them I've been
wanting them for so long
honestly you know this brandy melville
like pajama a little like flowy shorts
well I wanted them for like literally so
long but I couldn't like justify myself
with paying like $25 for a pair of
pajama shorts
but they had them on the website for
uber cheap and I was like yes so they
had four different colors they had black
grey which I got black and grey they
also had white and red I definitely want
to go back on web saying get the white
in red so these are the black pair
they're just like really comfortable
they're just like pajama material got
the elastic at the top and then the
frills at the bottom and then I got the
grey pair um super cute these are just
you know when you don't want to put an
effort you don't have time you don't
want to try to look good you still want
to look good these are your go-to things
so they're really cute just throw it on
with like a t-shirt and it's like you're
chill but like you look really cute you
know okay so the next thing I got
totally not what I expected like
literally so different than the picture
on the website but I liked it better I
you know thought there was just a
regular pair of like high-waisted shorts
but there
not there like as you can see there's so
much longer than normal Schwartz and
they're like extremely high waisted so
they're kind of like capris I know
there's like an official name College
for this but like I just don't know what
it is these are just light washed
high-waisted jeans with some distress in
them and they're just really really cute
so I feel like these are totally I've
seen people wearing these at Coachella I
tried the modern Urban Outfitters I
think they're cute I think they're
really cute it's definitely different
you know I'm excited to style them
because it's not like my typical
everyday shorts oh yeah I like it
they're just really cute excuse me then
I got two different bathing suits and as
you can see pretty much the only colors
I wear so first is this a white pair so
this is what the top looks like it is
just a sort of like strapless white top
but then it has this like halter thing
this part goes around your neck it has
this like a braided little detailing at
the top which is really cute I love love
the look of like strapless bathing suits
but I always just rely off like I don't
know how girls can just like wear them
and like not be conscious every two
seconds then it didn't come off your
body because there's nothing holding it
up but like that's not gonna happen with
this and then as the bottoms also match
and have like that whole braided thing
going on on the sides then I got a black
bathing suit which I love this one it is
just like this it kinda looks like a
sports bra could even go for a crop top
and then the back just has these little
straps on it and it's so cute like I
know that like when I go to the beach I
normally like wear my bathing suit like
walk around the boardwalk to go to lunch
and like I feel like this is just
something you could totally just like
typically wear then the bottoms are just
that side came untied but it's just like
these little like tie strings on the
side basic black bottoms the next thing
I got is this it is this little like
halter top but it's like made out of
knit but it's supposed to be a bathing
suit I think or is it a crop job a very
cropped crop job and it is just like
this black and white little stripe and
then zigzag pattern and it's got these
strings that tie around your neck and
back as you can see it's a little
smaller than I expected
definitely really cute I feel like this
is something I could style if I was like
only going to like you know like a beach
or like a pool party with some like you
high-waisted shorts like a little like
thing you know I could make it work but
I still think is really cute tying in
with like the whole Nick thing I have
these which is a gray a little crop top
v-neck so it is like literally made out
of a sweater but it is a tank top and a
common tension and I was like this is so
cute I'm gonna get it but it was really
cute and I was like I'm gonna get one
they had these in tons of different
colors if it's like that hot outside
that I do wear a crop spaghetti strap
tank top like why would I want a sweater
material but it's actually pretty
breathable like you're not gonna like
sweat to death unless like you're not so
really cute and really soft and
comfortable then if you know me if you
know me you know that I love oversized
men's t-shirts
I can explain like if you go in my
closet half of it is just large to extra
large men t-shirts no lie so I saw this
band t-shirt on their website and I had
to buy it at a large so I got this
Queens Queen in concert 1982 t-shirt and
then the back of it has the little Q
with some tour dates on it and I thought
it was so cute I was like yes this is
just something I don't know I wear them
with like you know ripped boyfriend
jeans or like some high-waisted shorts
like tucked in or baggy like a dress I
love wearing men's t-shirts it's like
t-shirt dresses it's just like I don't
know my thing I just buy them so much I
do it even a while but like I have way
too many extra-large t-shirts in my
closet so this next thing I bought I
wore like two videos ago so it is this
like white sort of cropped sort of
turtleneck not fully committed um ribbed
long-sleeve shirt with these like
shoulder cutouts which I think gives a
little extra you know jazz to the top I
feel like it's really really cute and um
you know the pleather is just so bipolar
outside so I was like I can't tell like
is it cold enough to wear a long sleeve
shirt or is it warm enough to wear a
tank top I don't know so let's go with
both
I love ribbed stuff too I think it's so
pretty then I got this dress so it is
this grey a bodycon dress and it is just
sort of tank top sleeved and it has this
knot in the middle so it's kind of like
a crop top and skirt but it's an
it is connected just plain in the back
and it has this not that like just sort
of looks really really cute in the
center Jai also feel like this is a very
like you could dress this down like no
problem like where this would like some
cute sneakers or cute booties and I just
feel like it's like a very like
universal dress then I got another dress
this is not a dress down dress this is a
dress up dress this is a nude just sort
of like super strappy crisscross in the
back it's like flowy at the top but then
like the bottom is just um body con and
it has a low back which I love low back
for the summer I feel like it's so cute
but this material this dress is made out
of like some sort of material I don't
even know I don't I don't know what it
is but it's so soft it's really really
soft yeah definitely I don't know if
just the next event I have to go to the
next dinner the next party I'm wearing
this little mama so you've seen this
literally all over my Instagram it is
this just like off the shoulder a little
cropped flowy long-sleeve top and it's
elastic on the top so like it just like
stretches off the shoulders super cute I
love it I love wearing this is like a
lot of like layered necklaces I think
it's really pretty
or like burrell let's pop it off the top
so many options it's so cute and I love
it it's just really just classic and
clean and cute you can dress it up you
can dress it down you can literally do
whatever you want with this because it's
so like simple but like still really
cute neligan I like it's really classy
