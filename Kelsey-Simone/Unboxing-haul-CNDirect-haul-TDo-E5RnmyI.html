thank you guys so today I'm going to be
filming a video for you guys I was
originally gonna do an unboxing haul
today I already took it out of the box
so we're just doing a regular haul my
cat's gonna be joining us so I got a box
in the mail full of some stuff that I
thought was pretty cool and so I decided
to do a little haul for you guys because
I don't know I just felt like it don't
question me so basically the box was
hard see interact if you don't know it's
just a website where you can buy stuff
literally not even joking everything on
that website is under $15 like
everything I got was under $15 and I got
some pretty cool stuff so it's pretty
awesome and I'm gonna be showing you
everything I got and I'll link
everything that I got below the first
thing you know one you okay guys I'm
just so excited that I got this you guys
have probably seen these on the Internet
everywhere these little bralets that are
just so cute so you've seen that on
Instagram on tumblr on We Heart It
wherever you look for inspiration
pictures and you probably seen this
bralette they sell it at Urban
Outfitters they sell them on different
places and so basically the one that
this is a knockoff of the specific one
that I wanted is originally $42 and
personally for me I feel like I wouldn't
want to spend $42 on something that is
just nobody would really see it but me
so I was like I'm not gonna buy that for
$42 but I really want to and they have
it on their website like three doll I
think it was three dollars three dollars
how are you gonna not buy this for three
dollars okay so I got the white one they
have a black one too but I already have
a couple black bralette so I was like
let's mix it up that's good a white one
so I did and it's like mesh and
see-through and then this little part
covers your goods and yeah it's just
it's really comfortable it's really cute
to wear under like flowy tank tops I'm
obsessed with it and I mean it was three
dollars okay so the next thing I got I
love so much I got two of them and I'm
probably they have like eight or nine
color options and I only got two just to
like try it out but
I'm going to go back and get all the
other color options so I got a like
purpley grayish one and then a nude one
so the nude one is already tied because
I wore it like yesterday
um so I'm not gonna untie it but um
basically you tie it around the back
your neck kind of like a halter but it
doesn't look like a whole sure it looks
kind of normal and so basically it is
just um like a sports bra I guess you
could also wear it as a crop top but
then it could also be like a bathing
suit top because of the material like
multi-purpose I guess I kind of wear it
as like a sports bra so I got the purple
one or is it gray and then I also got
the nude one and I'm so obsessed with
them they have like the little white
outline and they're so comfortable they
haven't opened back so it's just like
this that's like the back of it so it's
like pretty open back and they're so
cute and they're so soft and I'm pretty
sure these were like two dollars in
something and it's like three dollars so
this is pretty great and I honestly
because in the low prices I had like
really low expectations for the clothes
I was like it might be cheap they might
break fast they might like be like you
know not it's pretty good quality like
it's so comfortable and so soft and
everything fits me and it's amazing so
so the next thing I got I'm getting so
much summery stuff but I'm just really
excited for summer that I'm just like
already summer shopping so basically
this is a bodysuit and it looks kind of
big but when I put it on it's not so it
has the whole like open back as you can
see this is like a summer lifesaver I
can't wait because like honestly like
you can wear body suit this is simple
cute tuck it into a pair of jeans put
some mom jeans over top of it you're
going to you're cute whatever but then
it's also like bathing suit material
like it's so stretchy and so soft like I
feel like this could be a bathing suit
that like you're walking around you're
like I have my outfit on then like the
second you need to swim you can just be
like well BAM rip off the pants and then
you're just like I'm in a bathing suit
so it's really cute and it's just got
like the thin straps and I got it in
black I think they had like two other
color options but um yeah and again this
was like five or six dollars so super
cute it's really comfortable I love it I
love the open back I think the open back
is so cute and I'm obsessed with that so
I've already been wearing these every
single day
since I got the package so these are a
pair of sunglasses and they are so cute
so let me put them on mmm yes do you
like them I love them so basically I got
these sunglasses and I'm pretty sure
these are like a dollar in some sense
two dollars at the most I'm guessing
they were I don't know like I said I
like everything below these they came in
tons of different color options they
came in like silver they came in black I
think they came in gold the human Rose
Goldie's are the gold with rose gold
mirrored lenses I personally do not like
spending money on expensive sunglasses
because every pair of sunglasses I've
ever owned I haven't had for more than a
month because I always break them I
haven't under pair of sunglasses that I
haven't broken and like these are so
cute but like they're so cheap that
Leigh if I ever break them like it's
easy to just like oh let me just go buy
another pair it's two dollars in like
nine cents so basically I always either
like sit on them or let crush them in my
purse with something or they like be on
my head note bend over to pick something
up in the like fall and smash on the
floor just me these are cute and they're
not excited I've already dropped these
ones um and I've had them for three days
but they haven't broken yet which is
pretty good
okay then since I was in the hole you
know summary thing buying all these crop
tops bathing suits and sunglasses I
decided to get a pair of Schwartz
because um I need new shorts because
from last year most of my shorts don't
really fit me anymore decided to just
start stocking up on some shorts and
these were like five maybe six dollars
so I was like why not so basically
they're just super fringy ripped shorts
and they are blue because I only have
like two pair like regular blue shorts
feels like I need more than just like
regular denim and they're high-waisted
which is cute and the last thing I got
okay
all my friends um make fun of me um they
all judge me because I bought these well
life has just gotten better days have
gotten brighter mornings have gotten
better
I've been happier since I've bought in
this product
BAM okay I don't know what I was
thinking I don't really know what goes
on up in here most of the time so I
called up my friend and I was like you
know those light-up sneaker things and
she was like hey yeah why and I was like
what would you do if I bought them and
she was like I probably stopped being
your friend but I still bought them
basically I mean I've never actually
wear these out in public or anything
this is just like something that I
thought was pretty cool that I was like
I want to say that I own these so they
come in different color options there's
like a button right here that you click
so there's red there's blue there's
green there's purple there's blue again
there's yellow erse is that green
there's another blue and then this is
what I like to call the party option I
hate myself and I feel like I could take
a sec picture with these but they were
only $11 so I was like for $11 like I
might as well just get them because ah
ah I love torturing my friends oh I
almost forgot I got a pair of headphones
they're decorative headphones which I
thought was pretty cool I thought they
were glitter when I bought them on the
website but they came in in their foil
which I actually better I think that's
pretty cool the only way I can describe
them is like the wrapper of like a
Hershey's kiss and then like the volume
button is the same thing too but it's
pretty cool it's just like metallic
silver and they're like 99 cents so I
was like heck yeah she had that is it
that is everything that I got from CN
direct like I said for I will link
everything down in the description bar
because everything was pretty cheap from
the website I'm actually really happy
with everything that I got so um yeah my
links will be down below as well please
