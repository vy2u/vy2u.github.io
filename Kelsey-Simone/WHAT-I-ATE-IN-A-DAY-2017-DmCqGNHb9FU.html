different than normal but I've been
loving watching these what I eat in a
day video so starting off with breakfast
I went to Terrain cafe which is one of
my favorite places highly recommend
going there I got the breakfast board
which is basically eggs bacon potatoes
toast a little bit everything and then I
got these truffle fries which I honestly
eat like a little bit too much and then
I also ordered a rose ice to try like
how good does that sound
with my lunch I decided to make the
smoothie which randomly has been
something I've been making a lot
recently so I'll mix two frozen fruits
I used strawberries and frozen coconut
which I've never used frozen coconut
before but it turned out really really
good I normally use like raspberries or
blueberries but I didn't have any so I
use this and it was great and then the
sweetened it I use coconut flavored
agave this stuff is amazing if you don't
have this you can just use like honey or
something this is to just make it a
little bit sweeter and then you need a
liquid and I just use coconut milk again
use whatever you want but then just sort
of blend this together in whatever you
have like blender or a bullet just yeah
blend it all together
and then for lunch I made a salad Wow I
normally never eat healthy I swear I'm
not fronting for this video but I
actually do like to eat this it's really
good
so I use arugula and then I mixed
together olive oil and balsamic vinegar
this is a berry balsamic vinegar that I
actually buy at terrine I'll also use
sea salt and Parmesan cheese so get a
bowl and just mix the olive oil and
balsamic vinegar in the bottom this is
just going to be your dressing for the
salad also put my salt in there and then
just sort of mix it together until it
turns into a dressing and it's all
combined then I'll just pop my arugula
on top if you don't like arugula I'm
sure you could use something else but I
love it I'll add onions on to it and
then normally like me but I just didn't
that day and then just bring to a
parmesan and mix it all together
and then for dinner I went out to get
ramen with two of my best friends we all
got different things and then we all got
mochi ice cream for dessert so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video give it
a thumbs up if you did like this type of
video subscribe down below and yeah I
love you guys so much and I will see you
in my next video Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
