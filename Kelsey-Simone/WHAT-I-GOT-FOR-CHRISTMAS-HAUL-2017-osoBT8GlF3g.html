really happy today I'm going to doing a
what I got for Christmas video of course
a little disclaimer this is not me
trying to brag or be boastful of what I
have at all originally this year my
family and I we're gonna do the whole
you know it's just about family time and
Jesus Christ we don't need any present I
mean I don't really need anything I'm
blessed with so much and not even
materialistic things like I mean I
definitely don't eat those either but my
parents they decided to surprise me
they're pretty extra I can I tell where
I get it from I'm an only child
kind of the perks of being an only child
they just like to go all out for me so
they decided to surprise me and they got
me some really amazing gifts that I'm
really thankful and grateful for because
they're really nice and I'm just really
happy to get I thought or just show you
guys wow I need to come down I'm so
excited I just thought I'd show you guys
what I got I'm going to start off with
like the more big wowing definitely did
not expect this sort of present so the
more the bigger of the presents so they
got me the little Louie this is the mini
backpack I travel a lot and like for
photoshoots going to New York going to
the airport like I need something that I
can carry all my stuff in and like even
though this is small it fits everything
that I need inside of it or like all of
my purses are so small I like carrying
really small little bags and then I
don't really like carrying like a huge
big like preschool book bag so I think
this is just perfect for me the size is
perfect I think it's really cute it's
really pretty it goes with everything
and I just really love it so it's
definitely a staple I know I'm gonna get
my money's worth out of it and wear this
thing every single day so props to my
mom for remembering that forever ago I
said I wanted this so she got me this
which is basically the little phone case
for your phone then in here you actually
have enough space for like you know your
license your credit cards in stock I
also like that it perfectly matches with
the bag and then moving on to the other
stuff so she got me some Chanel beauty
products this is their hydro beauty
essence mist and you guys know me I use
face mists like five times a day so this
one I really like the packaging it's
like in this nice metal bottle smells so
good with rose water you know sometimes
you'll get like
full-on water drops on your face I don't
really like that but this is like legit
just a mist like there's no like big
chunks of water you're spraying on your
face like it's just really thin mist
which is nice for your on top of your
makeup and then we have more skincare
this is the extra radiance exfoliating
gel now exploiting gels are something I
use and I go through a lot because I
have really dry skin so this one's
really nice of course it's Chanel the
packaging is gorgeous I haven't used it
yet but I'll definitely keep you guys
like up-to-date if I like it or not and
then lastly she got me this Rouge Coco
shine this is in the shade 99 it's just
like this little lipstick you know the
colors deceiving out of the bottle or
out of like the lipstick it looks like
this really dark color but because it's
their rouge shine it's like almost like
a sheer it's like this really pretty
sheer neutral warm tone and it has gold
shimmer in it which you guys know I'm a
sucker for gold shimmer and anything
good like makeup so it's really really
pretty put some on my lips now cuz I
don't have anything and then the other
thing that we have is Gio Malone which
if you've watched my channel before you
know that I love them as a company I
love all their products but there's one
specific scent that they have that is my
favorite scent in the world I've talked
about it a bajillion times it is their
mimosa and cardamon collection which may
sound like it smells weird but like it
smells so freakin bomb you have to smell
it every time I try to introduce
somebody to the Sun I make them smell
the body wash I feel like it's like the
purest form of the scent I don't know
it's it's weird it smells so good I just
want to like drink the soap like it's I
don't even know how to describe the
scent like it I'm just in love with it
and then she also got me the candle even
though I know these are like a more
pricey thing but I feel like Jo Malone
candles are a really good investment
because one they last so long compared
to any candle I've ever had this lasts
so long and the smell is so strong
anybody can tell you burn one and
everybody is like are you burning a
jello and candle because it smells bomb
in here so these are a pair of balm on
sunglasses I mean well first of all can
you look at the packaging like it's so
so pretty and then of course with summer
coming up I like how it's still
literally Christmas and I'm like
summer but with the summer coming up
soon eventually I will definitely be
wearing these every single day so they
have this really cool almost like that
tortoiseshell sort of look but it's like
this white and brown they have like the
nice bar across the top and I really
like the shape of them and I think that
they're definitely like a nice everyday
sort of sunglasses they're not too out
there crazy outrageous that I can't wear
them every day but like they're still
stylish not that like I just they're so
pretty but I want to show you guys this
if you are on a bit of a budget but you
still really want to rock these
sunglasses okay
don't they look so similar these ones
are from forever 21 for six dollars and
they look so much like these like even
the print they've copied the print
around the front with like that similar
shape oh my god they look so similar and
then they have like the silver bar in
the middle if I can find these I'll link
them down below for you guys I'm gonna
put this back on should I put it back on
it was really festive so then my mom got
me some jewelry of course all of it is
like gold and sparkly because she knows
that that's what I wear a ton so they're
like little Cartier looking rings but
they have the rhinestones on them which
I'm so happy that I got the rhinestone
ones and then she picked me up these
three bangles the first to match the
bracelets so they'll have that sort of
Cartier look with the rhinestones all
around them which I think these are so
pretty and then there's also this bagel
which is pretty cool you just sort of
like unscrew it and then it comes out
and then you can put your wrist in and
then you screw it back on I think it's
really cool and it looks really pretty
and I like that it's just sort of like
simple but it's different then she
picked me up some little rhinestone
studs which I really like these one
they're pretty big I don't own any like
bigger ones like this all of mine are
like Lele teeny tiny studs so it's kind
of good to have like a little bigger
pair and then they picked me up this
little necklace it has like two
necklaces in one so it's like got this
plain gold chain at the top and then
it's got like a little teeny tiny baby
Kay that has rhinestones on it which I
think it's really pretty I like the
teeny tiny K I normally just have like
really big Kay's or like what does it
say Kelsey I don't have any like really
dainty ones and I've been getting into
wearing like really really dainty
necklaces lately so I think this is
perfect
now moving on we have two perfumes this
is from Elizabeth and Jane
it's their rose perfume which if you
guys have watched my channel you know I
love these perfumes I have a couple of
the cents but they're all rollerballs
so this is my first like full-sized
bottle of their perfume and I like that
she got me the Rose one because I'll
probably be wearing this one the most
because that's just like my go-to scent
is the rose and then she also got me the
k'kaw fragrance which was like really
random cuz I never said that I like
wanted this but I'm kind of glad she got
it because it smells really good
and I really like the packaging it's
super just like minimalistic this is the
crystal gardenia scent which definitely
that's 100% the note that I get is just
gardenia so I think I'm gonna be wearing
this more towards the springtime when I
want that more like a lighter florally
scent then I got a pair of bands which
I'm really excited about these these are
the fur of course they are fake fur but
like they're the white and cream furry
bands that they just recently came out
with they're definitely like more extra
than any pair of bands they're not like
an everyday pair but they are like still
simple enough that I could wear these
with almost any outfit which I love that
okay we're almost done we've got some
like random makeup here the Pharsalia
jelly bean glazed highlighter I'm so
surprised that she got this because
right now it's like sold out and like
you can't get it but I was talking about
like oh look how cool it is like when it
comes back I definitely want to get one
I really like the color of it this is
the most intense highlight it's really
cool you definitely don't need a lot of
it when you put it on like I tested it
on my hand and I was like wow this is my
all time for the past one and a half
maybe even two years now my all-time
favorite highlighter it is the large
Eller baked gelato swirl illuminator in
the shade gilded honey they do have
other colors which I haven't tried any
of them yet I don't know why but I have
the gilded how do you want and it's
broken and it's so sad because I'm like
trying to like lightly scrape what's
there it's so sad I don't know why I
haven't got myself a new one but I just
haven't yet so my mom decided to get me
a new one which I'm so grateful for this
I got a Tarte shaped tape as well as a
Pat McGrath nude lip set this is like
their liquid lipstick and then this is
like a pinkish gold gloss that you put
over the top of this and then they
picked up the I think it's I know I'm
saying it wrong
I say quarterly but I 100% know that's
not
you pronounced it this is their grape
water hydrating mist so it says it
soothes and moisturizes for sensitive
skin ooh that's an intense spray it's
just 100% organic grapes wow that's cool
hey this is a really good product it's
100% just grape essence so that's cool
and then the last couple of things I got
they got me one of these gold glitter
eye masks you put in the freezer and
then you can wear it and it's supposed
to like help deep up your eyes and then
of course they got me some Windows
chocolates and then two of these sort of
like they're like the stress relieving
like coloring books I have some of these
already and I really like them for
especially when you're like on the plane
traveling and you need something to do
