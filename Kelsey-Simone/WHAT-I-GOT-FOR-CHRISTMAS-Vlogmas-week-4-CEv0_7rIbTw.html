senior that's a hug morning it's
Thursday right now I'm just kind of like
editing so the lighting is definitely

my makeup off because I'm using makeup
wipes first now that my makeup is off
I'm gonna use this Josie Maran this
isn't like oil-based face cleanser I
don't have that much love because I love
this stuff but this is just gonna like
take any extra makeup off my face but
also just like clean my face and then
it on looking like on buttered hey now
that my face is completely clean I'm
gonna go ahead and exfoliate it
exfoliating is really good if you have
dry skin I'm gonna use the ocean salt
from lush this is like a face and body
scrub I think at that I would normally
just go straight into moisturizer but
I'm gonna do like a little bit extra and
put a face mask on I'm gonna use this
one it's just like this hydrating face
mask I don't know I got it at Urban I'm
going to leave this on for probably like
10-15 minutes so I kind of just like
once I take this off I just kind of like
rub thrust the serum into my face egg
moisturizer so my lips get like really
really chapped during the winter I
didn't notice I to lip mask so I'm gonna
use this mMmmm as you can see I'm
literally almost out and then last I'm
