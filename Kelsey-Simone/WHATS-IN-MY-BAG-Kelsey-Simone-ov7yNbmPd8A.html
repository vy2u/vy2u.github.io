she's just just okay we're gonna start
the video now if only people likes all
the weird crap I do before I even say
like hey guys who it's like a whole reel
of bloopers
hey guys so today I am going to be doing
a video by the way may look like I'm
bald but I swear I have like a little
ponytail back there somewhere I don't
know if you can see it anyway today I'm
going to be doing the classic what's in
my purse video because I feel like every
single like fashion or beauty youtuber
has this on their channel and I was just
looking through my channel and I was
like oh my gosh like I've never filmed
one so I decided to do one so this is my
purse I'm sure you've seen of Instagram
pictures before um I got this as a
present for my 17th birthday this was
like my big present for my last birthday
puts a Michael Kors I'll put the link if
any of you guys wanna you know Jack my
swag purchase my bag oh my god I love
the silver hardware it has this cute
little like lock on the front which is
like what attracted me to it I don't
know why I thought it was like really
cute and like look kind of cool I don't
know and then like I like the chain
detail on the side I like the square
shape I'm really attracted to bags with
square shapes I don't know why I just
that I like them I'm gonna be showing
you what I carry in this monstrous purse
that literally weighs like guess I am
you're a child so just like beware to
like see me pull out like actually like
large objects from this bag so I'll
start off um should I just like reach in
is that what people do so the first
thing I have is the most boring part of
my purse which is my wallet I felt like
if I have a black bag like I want a
black wallet to match them this is like
literally the only black wallet I have
like that's so weird how do I not have a
black wallet it's just like this little
plain leather black wallet I don't even
know where I got it to be honest but in
here I just have 40 bucks I never carry
cash but the only reason I have 40 bucks
is because I went to a corn maze and a
pumpkin patch with my friends and it was
cash only but then we found out it was
closed when we
out there um I have you know my you know
money card that Beauty Insider I have an
Ikea gift card because I return
something I've money on it you know what
we're just gonna like dump it oh my god
that was more stuff than I expected then
I just have like hella hair ties so
girly if you're with me and you ever
need a hair tie don't be afraid ask
because I have like 50 next thing I have
is a rollerball perfume this is the
Victoria's Secret
scandalous perfume this one smells
really good I got this one recently how
am I loved hearing roller balls I love
just like always being able to smell
good then I carry lotion in my bag like
a little lotion this is a soap &amp;amp; Glory
hand and foot lotion I use this hand
lotion
I mean I don't really used foot cream it
smells really good it's just basic
lotion then I have my spitfire sunglass
case but my Spitfires aren't in here I
actually have like these little like
Lennon glasses because I feel like they
look cooler and I wear these a lot more
than I spent fires so I think they're
really cool I actually get questions on
these a lot and I literally got them
from the Halloween store for like four
dollars so yeah you know things that I
my phone like duh who does not their
phone in their purse this was just like
in there I have my wild flower injury
case you guys know I love this case my
screensaver is a picture of Drake
Photoshop next to Drake and they're
laughing at each other um I feel like it
just really represents me I just like
connect to this on a personal level I'm
always laughing at my own jokes and like
I'm always just laughing at things that
I do like I think I'm so funny like I
don't know why and I know I'm my own
best friend so like literally like it's
just like me then I have BAM this Justin
Bieber hey I use this like I bought this
at the concert that I want to but I
bought one of these like little like I
don't know tag thingies tie my keys on
it and my house keys and then I have my
P o box keys then I have this which is a
portable charger and this is just like
your regular cord for like charging your
phone and then this it's like a little
pro skate van I got this at the van
store I need this this comes in handy I
have this which is so extra I know I
have like a full bottle of dry shampoo
my bag Elizabeth and James Nirvana the
white one I like the white and the black
they both smell really good
but basically it smells just like the
perfume if you don't have okay if you
don't have this perfume I'm really
recommend it I have this in the
rollerball and it's amazing it's
probably what I use like the most out of
all my roller balls it smells amazing so
I just have some touch-up makeup in here
I just carry like right in the little
pocket I carry a concealer so I have my
Dior the fix it concealer I've talked
about this before it is on like you know
the spendy side of concealer but I think
it's worth it it's a really good
concealer and it shaped like a lipstick
so it's the easiest application
literally ever to just go like that and
then blend it in with your finger and as
like primer in the middle then I just
have my honest - your clear brow gel
then I just carry this lipgloss or like
if I have like a special color that I'm
wearing that day I'll bring that with me
but I carry this it's like my everyday
favorite lip gloss this is the NYX
intense butter gloss in the color panel
brittle this is my go-to this is my
favorite is what I have on right now
yeah this is my everyday lip gloss
people always ask me that like my
favorite number one like lip color what
I wear this is what's in most of my
selfies this is what I wear pretty much
every day on my snapchat I have like a
touch-up highlighter which is this this
like travel-size benefit Watts up
highlighter I have this little lipstick
didn't really know this was in here I
must been wearing this this is a NARS
like sample size little darling it's
just like a nude lipstick then I have
this I have my Marva Jessica rose water
in here ahh oh you like heard my
sickness when I breathed in this is
literally just rose water um I feel like
people are probably gonna think it's so
extra people think it's so actually
they're like Kelsey why you can't like a
little bottle of rose water in your
purse it's just it's for a lot of
reasons one it refreshes my makeup it
makes my makeup look you know like right
when you fresh put it on I really dry
skin and especially with traveling this
is always in my bag because it's just
like really nice or when I'm not wearing
makeup this just like keeps my skin
looking alive it smells really good and
it's also really calming and relaxing
like if you have like a lot of anxiety
or something highly recommend bringing
rosewater in your purse spritz it on
your face because I have curly hair I
can spray this in my hair and it just
like makes my hair curly I don't know it
has a bajillion uses
also hand sanitizer this is a Christmas
one it's literally only November 2nd and
