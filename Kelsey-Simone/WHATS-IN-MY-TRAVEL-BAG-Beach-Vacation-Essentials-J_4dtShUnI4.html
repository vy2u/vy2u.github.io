pack with me I'm going on vacation to
Costa Rica in a couple of days so I
thought I'd bring you along while I pack
I'll tell you all my favorite travel
essentials some of the stuff I'm gonna
bring we're gonna pack both my big
suitcase here and then in this backpack
which I'm going to use as my carry-on
going to be at the beach so of course
I'm gonna need some denim shorts I'm
also gonna bring a little denim skirt
just for options but I'm gonna bring a
black pair of cutoff shorts these
girlfriend brand rolled up ones I have
anymore
yet and then also some cutoff Levi's
ones you guys know I wear pants like
this all the time light wash distressed
leave behind shorts of course I have to
bring those now there's typically two
ways I'll pack my suitcase either I'll
completely have every outfit styled and
then I'll pack those or I'll just pack a
bunch of random things and I'll stall
once I get there which I think I'm gonna
do that in this case for my tops I'm
definitely grabbing tops that could be a
beach cover-up but it could also just be
a regular top instead so I have this
little crocheted one I love little
crocheted shirts for the beach I think
they're amazing and then I also love rap
tops I have this one from szabo skirt
it's got little polka dots on it again
this you could easily just have this as
a beach cover-up like where your little
bathing suits go on the beach with this
but you could also just put a pair of
pants over it and it would be an outfit
this is one of those simple basic pieces
that I'm gonna pack just because I'm
styling once I get there it will
definitely go with everything that I'm
bringing I'm also gonna bring a little
flowy dress with me I love bringing
flowy dresses to the beach one in case
we go to a really nice dinner and I need
a little dress but also for pictures
this one is from revolve it's silky and
it's got this deep v and it's super fun
to twirl in so I think this will be
perfect one to bring you guys know I
love my pinstripe shirt I picked up this
one from Brandi it like cinches at the
waist which i think is really cool that
way you don't have to like to tie it
yourself because I think normally always
do that especially if I'm gonna wear it
just over top one of my bathing suits
and then of course we have some bathing
suit options I'm definitely going to
bring this one piece I actually bought
it last summer
and completely forgot and Nevermore it
it has like this rope detailing in the
front that I really like it gives me
nautical vibes which I love we have to
bring hats I'm gonna bring this lack of
color hat I wore this all the time last
summer me and my mom are like obsessed
with these hats I'm also gonna bring a
little dad cap this is like a nude
Calvin Klein one this always helps on
the beach when your hair is kind of
crazy
I'm also gonna bring this it's like a
little handkerchief I got from urban and
I've seen a lot of people tying their
ponytails and buns with these and I
really like the way that it looks so I'm
gonna bring this you have to bring beach
bags I have this one from cult Gaia it's
got this cool like black and nude
beading on it and I'm really in love
with it I think it's gonna be perfect
for the beach so I'm gonna bring this
I'm also gonna bring my mini backpack
I'm gonna bring a fanny pack and then
for like my beach bag sort of thing I am
obsessed with this bag it's like this
brown furry material and it has these
big gold clasps on it for shoes of
course I go with more comfortable and
beachy options I'm gonna bring my adidas
slides and I'm also gonna bring these
little black and gold chain slide ones
and my white slip-on vans these are like
my everyday shoe of course we need
sunglasses and you guys know I have a
big sunglasses addiction I have these
huge pair they're like tortoiseshell
ones that I really really like and then
I also have these like mini gold ones
and then I have another pair these are
just like black little mini ones I love
these of course you have to protect them
and oh these are cute I'm gonna bring
these to you can't have enough pairs am
i right I do travel with all of my
jewelry and little separate jewelry bags
make sure that they don't get tangled I
keep everything separated I'm definitely
like a jewelry junky especially when it
comes to the summer time I feel like the
main way to spice up like a pretty
simple summer outfit is to add tons of
jewelry with my bathing suits I still I
never take it off for some body products
I have a couple of things from the beach
definitely this this is a fave it's a
must-have not even just for traveling
well for traveling too but for this
this is the Jergens natural glow daily
moisturizer but when I'm on vacation I
like to make my tanning a little bit
more simple than using a moose and a
mitt and like all the don't like doing
that so this is basically a regular body
lotion like what you expect lotion to
look like just clear nothing crazy about
it but it will tan your skin as it like
sinks in then I like to bring with me
this of course you don't have to use
this exact brand but this is from lemare
it's their glowing body oil it's
basically just a beautifully perfumed
body oil that has gold glitter in it I
like to spray this on what I'm going on
the beach and it's great for pictures
too I also have some of the Natasha Dona
body glow and then I have the pixie this
is the Sun mist I'll bring regular
sunscreen from my body as well but this
is like a sunscreen and a mist form so
you can spray this all over you can
technically spray it on your whole body
but it's like sunscreen Animus more
products um you know your girls into
skin care so we have some products
actually this is pretty amenable for me
I have two hair products I bring my way
wave spray of course is it's the beach
my hair is normally um wet and it's
forming curly so I'll just spray it with
some little sea salt spray to texturize
it as well as this rose hair and body
oil or my skincare I have the Mario
Badescu cucumber makeup removing
cleanser and then I have this hydrating
fluid face mist this is from Valmont I
love this one it's easily my favorite
smelling hydrating spray ever for my
makeup this is all I have I'd normally
bring a makeup bag but since I only have
a couple pieces I'm just gonna use one
of the little pockets that's already
inside my suitcase so first I'm ringing
my Laura Mercier at my tinted
illuminating moisturizer this is pretty
much my everything I have my milk makeup
cream bronzer as well as my this is my
Chanel cream blush I also have my
Sunbeam from benefit which is basically
a gold liquid highlighter I like that
you can just kind of paint this on your
skin and just rub it around I have clear
brow gel and then my coconut bomb from
glossier and then a clear gloss from
Chanel and then for a perfume I'm gonna
bring just one I normally will either
travel with a couple like samples free
but I always try
just with the rollerball this is the
replica Beachwalk perfume this is just
easily my number one favorite perfume
for the summer it just reminds me of
summer and it just smells many things so
so for my carry-on I pretty much treat
it like a purse I have my keys with my
little doctor on it I have my wallet
obviously my passport will go in here to
a pair of headphones because I love
listening to music on the plane I have
my vlog camera and pretty much all my
technology goes in here all of my
charger charger I'm holding one oh my
chargers will go in here I'm also gonna
put some scrunchies in here and then I'm
also gonna bring this which is my little
I call me Jesus journal I basically
write down a ton of things like little
almost like my own daily devotional of
little topics my favorite scriptures
it's just a cute little thing I like to
write in it keeps me occupied when I'm
on the plane and also once I'm at my
gate I'll eventually buy like snacks and
fashion magazines and I'll fold that all
up in here thank you guys so much for
