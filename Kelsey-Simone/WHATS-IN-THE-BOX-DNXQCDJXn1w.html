actually Rosie a lot of people get that
confused so today I'm going to open a
box that's literally what I'm doing I
don't even know this is my first ever
boxing video I mean I think it is so
today I'm not just opening any box I'm
opening huh can you see can you see a
subscribe to a subscription box so this
subscription box is called fabfitfun and
it's not your ordinary subscription box
I honestly thought that subscription box
were kind of stupid I was like why would
you pay like $11 every single month for
samples in the mail like I can get them
for free at Sephora right but this one
caught my attention because it's
full-size products literally full-size
products like go big or go home if
you're going to try something get the
whole bottle fabfitfun is different from
with your subscription boxes because
it's not just beauty like it's not just
like a little lotion samples not only
beauty it's hair care lifestyle like
things you'd use in your house and your
kitchen in your room it's like they have
accessories it has gift cards they have
tons tons of stuff in this box it's
absolutely a pretty big box umm I have
not opened it yet I don't know what's
inside I decided to show you my initial
reaction on camera because how fun is
that
the first thing you see when you open
the box it's a really cute on the inside
and above the paper you see like this
little magazine
okay sure oh okay okay I'm not going to
read this so this actually has all the
products inside of here that's in the
box and then it like talks about them
and shows like little pictures of girls
using it which is really cute Oh
cuteness to the max oh well that's dig
in I'm literally so good okay ripping
the paper oh my gosh I'm gonna die this
is so cute you know that feeling when
you buy something like online and then
like it comes and you get that like
burst of happiness This Is It this is
like so cute I almost forgot to mention
I have a coupon code you're welcome
listen okay
with my coupon code you get $10 off so I
will put my coupon code here at Ain
Kelsey go do that and it'll
so be in the description below so that
you guys can you know go click and use
that so this box isn't not actually
monthly it is a seasonal box so you get
it four times a year seasonal and it is
themed for the season these are
originally 49.99 but they have a retail
of like over $200 this one's like 280 I
think which is really good ok so I
literally don't even know what your ever
ate this is the first thing that popped
out at me and maybe because it matches
my aesthetic I don't know that's just
like how my eyes were so it says ish on
it and it is a contour kit light to
medium contour sculpt into fine your
features let's open it girl you know
black and gold packaging is my thing
this is going on top of my vanity yes
already like it I've already approved so
I'm not gonna blind you but this is the
contour palette
it has a highlight to contour shades and
then a blush this ha it's like a
champagne color which is my favorite
color this contour honestly looks oh no
ok I thought it was going to be too
light for me but that that's a good
that's a good contour shade and it has a
nice big mirror this is Marrakech oil
who I use tons of oils I'm so excited
it's as original scent I wonder what it
smells like ok no joke this will
literally smells like a cup of frosting
but my hair is my short hair is so dry
so I literally am always trying hair
mask always trying oils to like find
what's really good for my hair so I'm
excited uses they literally know me ok
they send me a bath foam Trinity I live
for bath bombs I literally have a
collection of that bombs in my bathroom
that's me that's me right there one of
them is jasmine rose and sandalwood one
of them is lavender chamomile and I
don't know what that is and the other
one is eucalyptus peppermint in lime
closely my life it smells so good this
is so cute ok
hello legs for the softest shiniest
sexiest smoothie smoothie is taut who
wants smoothie legs can move this legs
ever I know I'm
that no joke it smells just like Laffy
Taffy oh I like this okay let's like put
it on the back of my hand so this is
thick this reminds me of a product that
I have for my face so definitely going
to be using this trying this out next
thing these two pieces of paper little
cards here they literally give you gift
cards that's amazing
sterling forever which I'm assuming is
jewelry banks they've diamonds on the
front $30 $30 and this one's $25 this
one is for another jewelry company they
have some jewelry on the back here it is
31 bit shop weird you good repeat oh
it's like one of those like it's for a
good cause it's all hand to me okay the
next thing I see mm-hmm a mom is happy
oh my gosh I've been wanting one of
these for so long grow three different
herbs complete project kit includes mint
thyme and basil this is so cute okay I'm
the weirdest person ever but like on my
life bucket list to get done before I
die is grow my own mint and basil but
like that's something I just really want
to do like imagine how cool that is
you're just like drinking your water and
you're like lol let's put some mint in
this and then you like pluck it off your
thing and put so I'm really happy look
at this necklace okay I'm all for gold
dainty necklaces that is my thing
there's happy dream love and inspired
and I got love it's just so few I even
like the little card it comes on like
this is so pretty okay I'm obsessed okay
we have two more things so I've had a
keratin treatment on my hair and I love
keratin hair products and these are
keratin of gloves and socks with a nail
strengthening and skin nourishing all I
want to hand in foot treatment because
there's socks too okay
easy to use disposable not tested on
animals whoo so I didn't know socks
could actually help me in life but now
they can and I'm really excited that
it's so squishy this is the weirdest
feeling ever
I'm just so intrigued by this product
I'm like really confused on like how
this is going to like be and feel okay
so this last thing is this what is it
it's hot pink matte strap plus still
don't know what it is oh like a yoga mat
duh okay so this apparently holds your
yoga mat
like I do yoga lol that makes sense
because you do roll up your yoga mat and
put it through the loops and then this
goes over your arm like a purse I'm a
genius and literally didn't even have to
read the back and I figured it out so
this is fun maybe it'll motivate me to
do yoga and exercise if I start going to
the gym you guys will probably end up
noticing it on social media my snapchat
my Instagram my blog my everything will
be down below as well as the pond that I
have and their website this is the last
thing here so I'm really really happy
