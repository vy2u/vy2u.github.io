button down there to subscribe to this

no intentions of people watching them

I'm going to start with the the biggest
thing so I'll give you guys the rules
for the giveaway at the end of the video
so the first I know I know it's really
cool so I decided to get you guys the
Cayman roubles pieces which is basically
the upgraded version of the camera that
I use um this is like the newer just
newer version of the same camera that I
have not only do you get this camera so
I got you can see I got you a ring light
this is the same ring light that I use
so I got my ring light for Christmas and
you guys know I've been loving it I
literally have it on right now as I'm
filming this it's amazing I used to use
three big soft boxes but now all I use
is the ring light it's honestly all you
need it's amazing especially if you want
to get into beauty veils because it just
makes it look so good I use it for
selfies it's really good for selfies
just everything it's all around an
amazing light so I knew I had to get you
guys one and I also bought you a stand
for the ring light because it is just
the light you need like a stand to put
it on top of so I got you one of those
and then I also got a tripod for the
camera tripods are very necessary
they're very helpful this is a lifesaver
it helps so so much and then in here
is much more camera stuff I got this
which is like a tabletop tripod it's
basically like a mini tripod I got you
guys two different lenses
this one is a wide-angle lens and then
you also have a telephoto lens I got you
two memory cards to hold all of these
videos in which is definitely more than
enough for different filters this filter
kit has three different filters in it
and then there's also altra violet
filter this right here is a compact
flash which basically hooks up to the
top of your camera and it's just like a
really good flash this I actually need
to get one of these myself this is
basically like a remote shutter for if
you were taking like say outfit pictures
or something and you don't have someone
taking the picture for you it's just set
up on a tripod you can like have this in
your hand
walk away press the button and it'll
take a picture for you then a USB which
helps importing from your camera to your
laptop the whole kit is here like
literally everything which you need now
we can get on into the rest of this
stuff all the beauty stuff jewelry stuff
it's a Kelsey starter kit it's basically
all of my favorite things I'm going to
start with all of the makeup stuff that
I got you so the first thing that I got
you I knew I had to get you guys this
this highlight I'm wearing right now I
don't know if you can know if you could
see but this is the Marc Jacobs coconut
gel highlighter dewdrops so I ate the
second I heard about this product
I went Add to Cart bought it and it's
amazing I've been using it every single
day since I bought it it makes your skin
look so glowy and doing beautiful so I
got you this highlighter because it's
honestly probably like right now my
number one favorite highlighter then I
got you one of the way hair care
products you guys know I love their hair
care products this is a dry shampoo I
thought that this is like universal
everybody uses dry shampoo so also cute
aesthetic packaging this stuff smells
amazing I'm a traditional so so good
something I also got you some face masks
so you guys might have seen this if you
follow me on snapchat so it's a bunch of
rose petals that you place them all over
your face
to form like one big sheet mask and then
I also got bit pearl case map all the
rest of the makeup I put in here so it
would be like all aesthetic and pretty
starting with another favorite of mine

primer I have so many primers and I
still only use this one every single day
also Mario Badescu rose water spray I
talked about this in every single video
so I had to get you one then I have here
all of these like melted matte liquid
lipsticks from toothpaste this one's my
favorite
Too Faced chocolate bonbons eyeshadow

yet but this is a bite Beauty cream lip
gloss on I have the same color so again
we'll be twinning this is in the shade
champagne pearl and it is gorgeous I
also have one of the color pop eyeshadow
palettes this is like a more pinky sort
of perfect for the spring pink colors
are always really good for this frame
and I have a bunch of Maybelline brow
products but I have these in every
single color so depending on a brow
product you are don't worry like I'll
have it a gear color just make sure to
like tell me or I'll ask you like what
color you use also I have all of these
colors of these nail art pens I never do
my own nail I'm so bad at doing my own
nails I just did them a lot when I was
younger but I never do my own notes now
but these are basically like nail polish
marker pens like they're really cool you
can draw like your own little design and
then also in the sort of beauty category
I got you some Lovington you guys know

obsessed with this company so I decide
to get you guys two bottles this is v2
hour Express and it isn't dark and then
also the deluxe bronzing mousse and then
I also got you a brand new applicator
mitt which just makes the whole process
so easy and I picked up this coconut
perfume I've talked about this before
I'm obsessed in love with this I have
some right over there
so again twinning on everything I got
you guys all of my favorite stuff it
smells like the most beautiful I wore
this all summer and then I got you this
little kit I thought that this is funny
because it's actually called rosy and
for those of you who have been here for
a while my old channel name was actually
rosy cheeks and freckles so I thought
their rosy I thought was cute okay
so this is a lush package
just covered in roses again I just I
just have a rose coconut thing okay so
everything in here is something I've
used and talked about before which is so
funny like it's literally a box of my
favorite do you get the tippy-top sea
bass bomb which is basically like the
white heart-shaped one with little rose
petals in it it smells crazy good the
roads are gone body conditioner which
I've talked about I love using it the
moisturizer all over my body I've been
tempted to eat it multiple times and
I'll let you know right now it doesn't
taste bad and then also a Rose jam
shower gel which I actually have in my
shower right now a rose jam bubble
bubble runes which I use those a lot
it's like a little rose shaped like
bubble bars becomes of an ultra bomb
multi-purpose bomb which I never use
that before but I think it's just a
moisturizer then moving on to like
accessories I got you some wild Fox
sunglasses again the case is super cute
- it's like a little hardnesses wall
talk so the ones that I got you are I
wanted to get classic like the last
frame so that they would just look good
on everybody and super cute and adorable
and then it wouldn't be a healthy
starter pack basically without some gold
chokers I got you guys these two from
urban this was like a shorter one if you
can like sort of layer them together
adorable you can mix and match these
with pretty much any necklaces you
aren't as they look it's everything
and then I also got you these Davonte
earrings which are gorgeous I wanted to
get some for myself I got myself some
gold ones for Valentine's Day but I
picked up these really sparkly just rose
gold circular ones for you guys I think
that they look good on literally anyone
and then on to sort of just random stuff
I got you guys a candle because you know
I love candles I have the same one as
well over there my bedside table I love
this so this of course a look at the
packaging super cute this is a champagne
scented candle it smells oh my god I can
literally just melt when I open that it
smells like a mixture of like a field of
flowers but like very citrusy a lot of
citrus which smells so good for the
spring I love the scent for the spring
it just comes in this like a little
glass case but I keep it in the box
comes so cute then I picked you up one
of these which is really funny because I
have the
and a lot of people ask me where I get
them but this is a marvel just sort of
keyboard cover it's like this thin
plastic little sticking on your keyboard
and it just makes an old marble and
super cute these are from urban they

like different styles but I like the
marble ones super classy super pretty
