since it's Friday I want it I was just
in the mood to do a more sit-down video
instead of a vlogmas if you're new to my
channel hi I've been doing vlogmas but
on Fridays is when I normally post so I
thought let's just do a regular video
but still keeping it festive and
Christmas themed we're gonna be doing
sort of like a winter slash December
favorites quick disclaimer this video is
not sponsored these are honestly just
all my favorite products everything I've
been using throughout the winter time
also these could be a really good gift
ideas for other people or for yourself
if you don't know what to ask for for
Christmas all of these are really good
ideas of things to get or to get for
someone else oh and a little outfit of
the day in case you guys wanted to know
my top is from tiger mist and then my
pants they're from I am GA of this chain
I really love them and I've been
obsessed with them do I just go I think
I'm just gonna go straight into fashion
so the first fashion thing that I have
to show you is more of like a trend it
than like an item I have three things to
show you I've been in love with leopard
print lately not that I ever used to
hate it I just never ever wore it I
never owned anything sort of cheetah or
leopard print of course everything that
I have it's just like the print it's not
real like cheetah fur or anything it's
just like sort of printed so the dress
that I have I do think I showed this
briefly in a vlog but this is from
mistress Rox it is a little bit
see-through as you could tell so I would
wear like a black like bodysuit dress
underneath just something strapless so
you wouldn't really see it and it's got
this super low back to it which is
really cool of course this is sure it's
a little bit summery I couldn't wear
this in the winter as my Christmas
present to myself I have in my car it's
basically this exact dress but really
long with long sleeves and it's like a
thicker material it's not like super
thin like this so it's definitely
something I could still wear they also
picked up these which are these they're
sort of like furry textured which is
cool they're like this cheetah print
stiletto heel and I might have even hold
these
I don't 100% remember where they're from
but I love them I think they're so cool
with just I honestly might wear it with
this outfit for like an Instagram
picture
just because it's more of a wild print
haha while get it cuz it's cheetah just
because it's more of like a wild print
doesn't mean that you can't style it
with a lot of things that's a
misconception a lot of people have
they're like oh it's got like this
really cool print on it I can only wear
it with a couple of things but these you
can style so many ways then I have this
which I know you guys are gonna love
this too it's this sort of like just
stressed denim but it's like stretchy
denim it's this cropped cheetah print
jacket yeah I love a good cheetah print
jacket and of course I do have like my
really big furry one that you guys have
seen me wear at times so I have my
beloved Balenciaga boots I purchased
these recently and they're so pretty
like look at them they're so pretty
these right now are way more comfortable
than when I first bought them but I'm
still not a hundred percent broken into
them yet they do give you really bad
blisters for the first like two weeks
you have them and then I also have I
don't think you guys can see them at all
but I have like those sticky um like the
gel pads in the back of those definitely
did help a lot it's just that they're
brand new and because it's hard leather
I'm just a pansy so but I think they're
really good investment they're gorgeous
shoes they go with absolutely everything
and this was exactly sort of what I was
looking for for the winter I wanted a
flat boot something leather and
something that had like sort of a metal
detail on it I've been wanting them for
like three years now they're not a brand
new Balenciaga shoe these have been out
for a while and three years later I
still was in love with them so I was
like just get the shoe Kelsey just do it
and I'm so happy I did I can't wait to
just fully break them in and wear them
actually every day so even with this
outfit like they would look so good with
this outfit this right now has been my
favorite winter candle this is from DW
home this is their winter spruce candle
oh my god it smells so good what I like
about this is so this Bruce is like you
know your classic Christmas tree scent
but I find most of the candles that have
that scent are way too spicy that it
smells like men's cologne and I don't
like it so it's hard to find the perfect
balance between like it has that spicy
spruce smell and this has just enough
sweetness in it to the point where it's
not overpowering and you're like oh you
know I really like the glass I think
it's really pretty it goes nicely in my
room
so this is the first leaked product that
I had this has been my winter scent I'm
just so in love with it this is from Joe
Malone this is their velvet rose and dry
body oil this is actually it's not a
perfume it's a dried body oil so
basically the reason I prefer this over
perfume is that my tan if you're new to
my channel I wear fake tan year-round
and you can't wear perfume when you have
fake Tanner on because the alcohol that
is and it will break up the fake Tanner
so the dry body oil does not affect my
fake tanner
you spray it on just like a perfume and
then you just sort of like rub it in and
you still have that really nice strong
perfume that's also what I love about
Joe Malone is their stuff stays on so
long like you really smell it all day
because it's so highly scented cuz
they're velvet rose and food so this is
like their second rose scent it's not
like there's some reef frilly light rose
scent which I normally wear in the
summer this is like they're more warmer
musky or rose scent which is exactly
it's like me but like winter edition
like the extra festive edition this is a
really good Christmas present idea so if
you don't know what to ask for for
Christmas I'm telling you right now this
it's amazing
last thing before makeup is of course I
had to talk about some skincare and of
course it is from fresh if you don't
know this fresh is my favorite skincare
brand I'm dedicated to them I love them
all of their products work amazing on my
skin so these two things I don't use
them together I use them like one after
another but in the winter you guys know
I'm very dry skin but in the winter it's
worse so I have to really make sure I
keep it not dry this is there sugar face
polish which that it's like an exfoliant
it has strawberry seeds in it and it's
just a really nice exfoliator for your
skin this has like changed my skin I
love this and then this is a face mask
this is their black tea instant
perfecting mask when it comes to face
masks I I like to relax in my face mask
like I'll put one on I'll watch a whole
movie I'll end the video and then I'll
take it off you know so this is one of
those things that I have sensitive skin
and it's perfectly fine on my skin it's
really gentle on your skin but it does a
really good job of softening your skin
which I love and it smells so good it
has this like really buttery creamy
texture that you
sort of lather it all over and you can
leave it on for as long as you want for
makeup I have two products the first
product I have is this eyeshadow palette
now towards the winter time I tend to
gravitate more towards eyeshadow bouts
because I never ever ever wear eyeshadow
except for in the winter when I want to
like warm up my eye look a little bit or
during like holiday parties or New
Year's I'll add some like glitter or
something this Christmas this has been
my go-to eyeshadow palette this is the
NARS wanted palette they sent this to me
and I knew this was gonna be my winter
palette so basically you have everything
jumbled in one of what you would need so
you have all your matte neutral shades
if you just want to do like an everyday
I look plus you have a couple of like
really intense pretty glitters in here
for like if you wanted to like Pat some
on your lid inner corner instant party
look and I really just like the color
selection that comes in here because
they're just sort of my tones of what
I'm comfortable with wearing and what I
normally wear the next thing I have is
kind of crazy because it is a blush and
if you know me if you've seen any makeup
video of mine
I don't wear blush it's not that I
dislike blush I've just I don't know I
just have never worn it but this stuff
I've really been getting into so this is
from glossier I picked this up when I
was at their showroom in New York and it
just sorts like intrigued me I was like
I don't have a liquid blush like let's
just try it out so I have this in the
shade dusk which is like their very
neutral sort of natural color it's like
a liquid it's literally a paint and you
just sort of like dab it on blend it
around I like that you can control it
it's very controlled I can have as
little or as much as I want on top of
the fact of the shade is like super
natural it actually looks like I'm
naturally flushing which I think that's
so pretty
mmm I actually didn't even my lip
glosses all over it I didn't even think
about having this is one of my favorites
but it's easily one of my favorite
things right now I've been drinking them
like crazy this is a San Pellegrino the
lemon otta the lemon um it's like a
sparkling water they have tons of them
that are really good but the lemon ones
I've just been like gravitating towards
more and probably the
Christmasy thing this whole video is
gonna be some order these ones these are
the dark chocolate peppermint I've never
had these ones before my mom just
brought them home for me I love that so
yeah those have been at my couple of
just favorite things I've been using
