do it like a little get ready with me
because I did say I was gonna do one and
I have to get ready right now so I was
like why not film it we're just gonna do
it my everyday makeup look just like a
little natural you know the typical
Kelsey bronzy glowy skin I'm gonna show
you guys my favorite products we'll get
ready together first I'm gonna start off
with skin care I'm gonna start off with
under-eye cream because my under eyes
are really dry I just kind of put that
on with my ring finger blend it all in
it's really good at deep puffing in the
morning so that's nice I'm gonna use
this today just try use something new
this is the Josie Maran whipped argan
oil face butter ultra hydrating love
those two words together I know they say
like technically it's not good to like
keep changing your skincare products um
well I honestly I just have so many that
I like trying new things you know so I
always like to moisturize my lips
especially during the winter because my
lips get really really chapped the
foundation I'm going to be using the
Becca the aqua luminous perfecting
foundation I just got a new one this one
is in the shade tan and this one's for
when I have like my fresh fake tan so I
don't match right it looks a little dark
where's that one better I don't know we
can try this is one shade lighter this
is in beige
let's see oh wow that looks really dark
oh my god that looks way too good oh
yeah mm-hmm
definitely my color honestly to be
completely honest it's not that bad
let's just try a worst-case scenario we
can wipe it off this is my normal color
this is in the shade beige and I'll
normally notice like right when I put it
on its my shade and then as the day goes
by it gets lighter and then I'll know
why is my face so light compared to the
rest of my body so this was running out
anyway so I was like oh I'll just go get
a new one and I'll get it one shade
darker this doesn't look that bad now
that I've blended it out actually for
concealer I'm using the hourglass this
is their hidden concealer in the shade
warm I'm just gonna put that right on
underneath it's very creamy like super
it just glides right on and blender it
out I'm just gonna blend this out my
ring thing
now I'm just move straight on to
eyebrows I use three products for my
eyebrows today I'm gonna use the honest
Sacha Beverly Hills the brow is and then
I used the Mac clear Sutter brow gel and
then also the YSL Couture brow tinted
brow gel I basically just brushed
through with the clear brow gel and I
like to brush my hairs up and out so
it's like that messy like super natural
look plus it just makes your brows look
a little bit thicker I do the same exact
thing with the tinted brow gel this just
like sort of fills it in a little bit
without giving too much definition know
I always have one good brow this is
always and forever been my good brow and
recently it's changed to this one and I
don't know why like I don't know how
that happened but it did basically just
made really small strokes underneath the
brow like just make like an underline
just to define the shape and then I
blend it out because I don't like it to
be too harsh so now I'm gonna go in with
bronzer I'm using a huge Marc Jacobs
bronzing brush we're gonna use the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer bronze
right here in our cheekbones and I just
do the typical like three like I do the
forehead the temple down here and then
underneath the jaw so we're gonna do
that and then occasionally I will go in
with like a smaller more tapered brush
just to get like this center right here
um but because I'm in a rush I think I'm
gonna skip that step I'll normally just
keep going till I get my desired effect
for my highlight I'm gonna take my Laura
Mercier fan brush and then this is the
honest taja it's just their ultimate
glow palette also here on my rose water
just let me get some more like intense
look I'm gonna go with the shade White's
and this one right here I'm just I bring
it underneath my eyes as well um I don't
know I just started doing that oh that
looks nice we head down the bridge of my
nose and very much on the tip of my nose
I think that's the cutest thing ever
now we're gonna do mascara my knees my
Chanel lash primer and then the roller
lash from benefit this is easily the
most commonly asked question or comment
that I get is like what mascara do you
use you
the benefit roller lash and I use it
with a lash primer and I go in between
different lash primers I'll either use
this Chanel one or I'll use the L'Oreal
voluminous one or I'll use the Mac lash
primer I don't know what it's called but
I know it's from Mac we got the benefit
the roller lash has recently been at my
all-time favorite for mascara I just
really like it I like the effect it
gives I like the look of it and I really
work it in there like probably doing my
mascara takes me a good 20 minutes okay
so here's the lash look I thought I'd
show you um as you can tell now I'm
going to take this pointed like sort of
pencil brush just sort of sweep it under
my lash line I just kind of think it
adds some intensity to the eye and it
definitely makes your lashes like look
thicker and more bold I guess like it's
just a little touch but I really like
doing that and then for my lip color I'm
gonna be using the Dior lip Maximizer
and this is in the shade zero zero sex I
really like this one it's just sort of
like a clear gloss and then of course
some rose water oh my god it's so cold
there we go okay I'm gonna do my hair
now umm so what I'm gonna do for my hair
I think I'm gonna go grab like my little
mini curler actually might have it back
here and just add a couple little curls
in here just to make it look like a more
uniform hair this is what I'm gonna use
it's like this really small barrel we're
just gonna add a couple punches mainly
just like in the front and in the side
just to add some detail I haven't used
this yet I got it at Sally beauties it
was honestly only like 20 bucks I'm not
gonna keep it on for too long either
because I don't want it like that crazy
curly just like give it some definition
you know okay let's see how this turns
out like I said I haven't used this yet
so I don't know what it's gonna look
like oh wow do you see that that looks
pretty oh that looks really good I like
that
all the pieces in the back are like
pretty naturally curly I just wanted
like my front pieces to be a little bit
more like defined you know because some
of them just get like really weird okay
let's see this is the last one I'm oh
I'm gonna do I only did like four or
five
chunks of hair but see I think I'm gonna
keep it just like this there we go um
and then now I'm completely ready from
like here up I just need to get dressed
I'll give you guys like a little
finished look here the lighting is
actually not that bad just my everyday
makeup pretty much the same nothing too
