quality difference in this camera
because I got a new blog camera and with
my mom they yes so we're going to go get
a treat now I just got a little clip of
you hello everybody since I got a new
camera I was thinking why not do a week
in my life video plus I've been watching
like a lot of them and I wasn't going on
do one I guess I'm starting my vlog here
right now I am uploading a video which
was last Friday's video I broke my
thumbnail which is really sad which is
why we're going to get them fake thing
I'm going to get them shorter just like
a little bit more practical I just
worked out which feels really weird to
say because I never work out literally
ever but I got a waist trainer recently
and like I started working out with it
just because I thought it would be like
fun I don't know so yeah I'm lounging
I'm probably going to go to bed now so
I'll see you guys tomorrow
ok good morning I'm in the middle of
doing my makeup which is why I look like
I'm in the middle of doing my makeup my
parents are out walking the dog and I'm
just getting ready my mom and I are
going to go get our nails done
so for highlight I'm going to use this
new product I got this for Valentine's
Day by the way yes my shirt is John Cena
I'm very aware it's 11 so this is just
like a no Luminizer it's not a golden
ish color and put some there you
probably can't see the lighting is like
super weird in this light corner but you
see if you can see the glow okay I'm
done now and then of course that's my
third time spraying that today so this
is my outfit of the day pretty simple
I'm not really doing much today I'm just
wearing my white slip-on van and then I
just have like a black long-sleeve
hoodie on my bag and yeah although it's
a little windy
thank you what I always get every single
time I come here for brunch
I get the manager special it's so good
YUM this is what I got you got the same
thing just got our nails done we got the
same color I got my fake nails off just
because I wanted them more like
practical I just wanted them to look
fresh and sleek so I just got this like
nude color so right now I'm in H&amp;amp;M has
some pretty cute stuff I have this like
black denim skirt this to rest I have no
clue what I'm going to wear it to so if
you want to try it on I have just like
risky sweater dress this clutter and
then a pair of shorts and then I have
this like really cool hoodie I'll let
you know what I end up getting this is
such a look oh my god get off you are
not supposed to be on my carpet I am
right now going out to dinner with my
parents I changed just because it's
raining now so I wanted a hood hey was I
cute it and I love you look at her she's
a model she really is a model here's the
other model hi look at you so let me
give you a little outfit of the day I
have my little flirty slides on and the
stress it like ties in the back and it
just like house splits on both sides
with the lighting skirt here mom
hi weird it is super nice out today it's
colder than it was yesterday so like I
have my bomber jacket with me but right
now we are about to go out to lunch okay
so I'm home now but I thought I'd give
you guys a haul of everything that I got
at the mall yesterday I just have it all
in a pile here so the first thing I got
it's a rhinestone bra let I've been
wanting one of these for a while and
then if you follow me on snapchat you
would have seen this I just got this
nude sort of beanie I'm really excited
about this is more it's a little bit on
the like scandi side but I only really
plan on wearing it towards the beach as
like a cover-up sort of thing it's just
like this white blouse it's
long sleeve and it like ties in the
front but it's like super open so it's
like this really distressed black denim
skirt this you guys saw I wore yesterday
I'm obsessed with this it's like white
denim and black denim it has like white
death buttons and then it also has the
guest logo down here also from the men's
section I got this like really ripped up
sweater I bought something in color
I know so they're basically just regular
mom jeans but they're like this mustard
color and they fit perfectly I guess I'm
liking this mustard color thing because
I got this guest shirt it's long sleeve
shirt it has this sort of just like
distressed guest symbol on it which is
really cool I changed into comfy clothes

and I'm eating it off and I have a
little heater on in my room because it's
so cold my room is in the attic and it
