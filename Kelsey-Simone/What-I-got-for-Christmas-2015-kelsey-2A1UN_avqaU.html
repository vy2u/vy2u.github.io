out so late Christmas was like a week
ago and I'm gonna do what I got for
Christmas but you know better late than
never so um just wanna start off this
video by saying I'm not trying to bribe
just thank you to my mom my dad Rachael
Santa
you know just Jesus she's everybody who
got me stuff that made Christmas lit
this year so I'm basically just gonna
show you guys everything I got for
Christmas this video was literally so
requested and um you guys wanted to see
it so I'm doing another one I did one
last year um and I'll probably put the
link in the description bar for you so
the first thing I got so I got this
bedding um you can't really see it that
well but I got all the weight bedding um
it's something I've been wanting for a
really long time it's just like a really
nice full set of white bedding so I got
this like comforter for pillowcases a
sheet and a bedskirt and i have it like
haffley done not that well done but it's
okay then I got um some things from
Victoria's Secret I'm not going to show
you everything cuz it's bras and
underwear that'd be kind of like weird
to show you that but I got two bras and
then underwear obviously and then I also
got um one of these bodies phrase
because if you look in my bathroom I
literally own a collection of like 20 of
these so I got another one also when you
spend $75 you get like one of these free
blanket thingies and I got one you guys
know how much I love blankets and I got
one of these boy kids and it's literally
this office thing ever booking it will
go pretty deep just look at aged look at
it
look can you eat any cocaine then
another thing I got which I was honestly
so excited for I was kind of nervous
because we did get these offline and I
wasn't exactly sure what they were gonna
look like in person but I got these
beauties look at these just look at them
so these boots are from public desire
and I'm literally obsessed with them
they're like this velvety sort of
material and they have a heel they're
not very comfortable but they're
extremely cute and um yeah so I was
obsessed with these I saw them on their
Instagram and I was hiding
- I need to get those so I put them on
my Christmas list and I was originally
gonna get them in leather but then last
a minute I was like mom get the velvet
and she did and I'm actually really
happy that I got this because I had no
shoes like this and I freaking love them
the next thing I got is a little set I
got the central Pez tanning mousse and
one of the myths I am obsessed with
self-tanning like I'd honestly self tan
like throughout the whole year if I
could I personally think I look better
with the tan and I'm just like obsessed
with tanning so my mom got me the mousse
I've had the mousse from forever ago but
I needed a new one and then also I got
the mitt because you very very much need
this when you're using the mousse
because if you use your hands it's not
going to go on evenly and it gets all
like inside the little the little crabs
um next we're going to talk about some
thanks we're going to talk about the
makeup that I got I got two liquid
lipsticks and I'm starting a collection
I'm obsessed with liquid lipsticks um
the first one I got is a Velveteen from
Lime Crime my mom literally surprised
you with this this wasn't like I didn't
tell her to get me this like it's funny
because I literally screenshotted this
exact same color off Instagram that I
wanted and like I was so shocked when to
find out that she got me this color so
this is in the color shroom and I've
worn this a bunch already like probably
like five days and Christmas was
probably like five days ago but it's
like this really pretty like burnt
orange brown color
I don't know I'm obsessed with it and it
dries matte it stays on forever I love
it and can we just talk about the
packaging the packaging is probably one
of the cutest things ever and then I
also got um a honest taja liquid
lipstick which I need to start
collecting these these are amazing
I literally wore this and it stayed on
for so long these are such good quality
liquid lipsticks so again super cute
classy packaging this is in the color
vamp and it's just it looks different on
than it is in the bottle it's like the
super dark um like I'll just see a baby
red but that's fitting because it's like
called vamp it's like this like dark
sort of like wine berry red
I love it especially for winter right
now super in dark lip colors then I got
the world's best mascara
it's the Too Faced better than sex
mascara and this mascara I fell in love
with last Christmas I got like a little
sample of it I don't know if you
remember that but I did
and so I've loved it ever since then and
I got a full-size is my first full-sized
one so I'm really really excited then I
also got this foundation this is the
benefit hello flawless oil-free oxygen
Wow broad-spectrum SPF 25 brightening
sunscreen makeup that's a really long
name but this is an amazing foundation
it has like a little pump right there
and um I actually got this in the wrong
color so we returned it and got a
different color but it's so good if you
have dry skin like me and especially in
the winter my skin is a lot more dry so
I like using this a lot better than my
Mac like full coverage foundation
something my mom got me that I really
really really need was a little face err
cleanser your thingy um it's kind of
like oh I'm such a bad youtuber um I
don't know how to talk I swear I can't
turn it all back to bidness back to
bidness okay
so kind of like a clear sonic but not a
Clarisonic I'm not to know what this
called it's like a vibrating toothbrush
for your face so um it's blue and white
which is pretty good love those colors
and it comes with this which um at first
I was really confortable like what this
was but it holds this so that you can
like set it down your bathroom and like
the bristles don't get dirty which i
think is really smart
if you press a little power button and
adds like two different modes like
normal modes and faster mode so far I've
used it every single day since I've
gotten it um and so far I've loved it
next I'm going to talk about a couple of
accessories I got this is something I've
been wanting for literally so long I'm
obsessed with these little poopy like
key ball chains I know these are like a
big do right now I have a miniature
white one but it's not even like an
official purse keychain I sort of just
like made it so I got an official
and I got this like purpley gray color
which is honestly so pretty like I would
have never thought in my head to be like
mom get a purple one but I like really
really like it's like this dark purple
gray um it is really pretty so and then
I got these sunglasses these I picked up
there's a here I got these on from
forever 21 and I'm obsessed I mean I
know it's like winter so like I don't
really need sunglasses but I'm obsessed
with sunglasses and I pretty much break
all of them I don't know how but I
always end up either like sitting on
them or like stretching them too far
like snapping them so I got another pair
and they're just black cat eye ones with
like gold detailing and I really like
this bar across the top I've always
wanted a pair with that in it so I got
to me one next thing I got this was
actually an early Christmas present I
got this maybe like a month ago it is a
nude Kate Spade wallet it has gold -
sort of detailing on it a Kate Spade
store with my mommy like a month ago and
we were looking at them and I really
likes this one and my mom was like do
you want it it'll be an early Christmas
present and I was like heck yeah so I
got this and I'm obsessed with it rachel
is um doing some weird things on
FaceTime right now oh no no no put it
put it back on so um dude I have yeah I
got some good some hot cash um hot topic
you know swears that I have a McDonald's
trick and treat um free hamburger I
really hope oh oh oh this is an expired
I'm so excited k Finnegan and I have
some money in there and I did get money
for Christmas probably be doing like a
try on whole soon maybe who knows um but
yeah that's pretty much it my well it's
not that interesting then I got this
from forever 21 so I got this jacket
from forever 21 and it is so cute it's
just like this black denim jacket and
it's got like the little like white wool
around like the neck and I think it's so
so so cute I've already worn it a bunch
and it's really nice and then last but
definitely not least we're going to talk
about Rochelle Rachael and I decided to
do like a thing where we got each other
like
box of ten different Christmas presents
so I'm just going to show you some of
the stuff she got me she got me um she
got me a contour palette from Ulta how
pretty it is so she got me this because
on FaceTime with her I dropped my
contour palette and my Mac one and
shattered it so she got me new one which
was very thoughtful
and then also she got me a highlighter
and this oh oh girl this highlighter is
so good it's in the color yellow diamond
it's Ulta brand and this is honestly my
favorite highlighter like I have so many
high-end drugstore like you name it I
probably have tried it before this is my
favorite highlighter I have it on right
now can you go can you see that I don't
know if you can it looks good okay she
also got me the benefit world-famous
neutrals palette because look at it it's
so cute it comes with two of the mini um
cream eyeshadows and then like a little
quad eyeshadow palette and then she got

about because look look at that it has
little mini nuggets on the top of every
