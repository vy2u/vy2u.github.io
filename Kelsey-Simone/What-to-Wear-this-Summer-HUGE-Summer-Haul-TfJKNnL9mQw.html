the summer is coming up the weather is
warming up and right now they're just so
many cute trends that I've been wanting
to get my hands on that I finally got
from Lulu's so yeah this is basically a
huge Lulu's haul I'll link their website
and just everything that I talked about
will be linked below so many cute shoes
and so many cute dresses to talk about I
think I'm actually going to dive in with
the shoes the first pair of shoes that
I'm going to be talking about are these
furry slides now I have a lot of furry
slides but these are super different
this far this is safer by the way this
is the softest fabric I've ever felt my
life I don't even know what this is but
it's so soft memory foam here and then
the whole bottom is lined with fur so
it's the most comfortable shoe I've
seriously ever put on my feet I like the
shoes have like an X formation I feel
like this is like a lot cuter than just
a basic like one band of fur
I'm also diggin the cork at the bottom
it kind of gets like a Birkenstock feel
I definitely know that this is going to
be like my go-to summer shoe just like
comfy slip-on go to quick grab okay
these next shoes that I have I don't
even have like words to describe like
how beautiful these are so oh wow
just oh wow these are these gorgeous
black and white snakes game it's strappy
heels not real snakeskin it just makes
skin print but normally snakeskin comes
in like a nude or like a brown but I
like the pants are black and white you
know I have my whole black-and-white
aesthetic so a black and white snakeskin
is like a must-have for me and I love
simple strappy heels I wore heels just
like these to prom in nude so the fact
that they have like a staple print just
definitely makes them like a piece I had
to get um yeah these are amazing the
next pair of shoes that I have or super
trendy right now and tons of people have
been wearing them but it took me like a
little bit to get into that at first I
was not feeling the mule game and I was
like at they're not for me but they've
grown on me like I've been really
digging me lately so I got these like
black sort of just suede chunky heel
ones I like the shorter chunky heel
because anytime you can put a Hilo on a
shoe and it's still comfortable I'm all
about that these are just sort of like
my summer everyday shoe but like the
dressy everyday shoe they're open-toe
they're just super
so they're going to be like super
breathable and nice for like wedding
it's hotter these are the last pair of
shoes that I got their these release
strappy nude heels these like wrap all
the way up to your knee which I'm
obsessed with that look they have some
straps on the tote some straps around
the top of the foot I was originally
going to get these in black but I
noticed I have like one pair of nude
heels so I wanted to get the nude one
looks choppy heels and strappy flats are
like always in for the summer and I got
some sunglasses as well but I really
wanted to talk about these because you
guys have seen these already I've worn
them honestly every single day since
I've gotten them I have a lot of glasses
with the same sort of frame I just feel
like they're really flattering on my
face who has this blue sort of tent over
the shades with these gold thin bars and
it has a brown sort of tortoiseshell
marbling that I don't know why I like it
so much I'm wearing these every day I
carry them in my purse with me like I
just think they look so good
and then the next pair that I got these
are like super big chunky like this deep
red sunglass the shape reminds me of
like a saintly repaired I've been loving
with the pop of red in my wardrobe so
these are like key these are the last
pair that I got they have like these
smoked grey sides and then like a
greenish sort of grey pink it like heyou
over the lenses I really like the silver
like hardware because I always wear gold
everything that I have this gold but
like every now and then I'll wear silver
so having like silver sunglasses is nice
and I really like the round sunglasses I
highly remind me of like the Lennon ones
I just really like the shape why do I
feel like 10 times last year with
sunglasses on the last thing I got
accessory-wise is this backpack
backpacks are essential for me in the
summer they're so low-key they're so
just easy you just like throw it on you
forget about it it's back there and most
of my persons I have are like really
small like I like small little purses so
for going to the beach for traveling
like this is just so nice to have
because it carries so much more so it is
this black leather backpack with gold
hardware it has these backpack straps
but it also has this purse strap if you
want to carry this is removable though
and there's just like so much room in
this thing like it's honestly huge also
just going to subside as vegan I'm so
excited to talk about this
equating I got this off their website so
excited I got this red heart floating
they have this in pink also pictures and
definitely going to be seeing so many
instagrams and snapchats is this thing I
have a right here um I don't know if I
can fit the whole thing in the frame um
I'm so excited to own this like a living
Hunter the actual clothes I have these
two bikini top I didn't get the bottom
so the babies to talk because they were
like a little cheeky but like I totally
are playing bottoms that would go with
this so this one is like this bando
style like it looks like a little banjo
top with these really dainty straps I'm
obsessed with dainty straps it's such a
cute detail anything with super thin
strapless dresses tank tops whatever I
need to get it love that and then I got
this sort of I love the texture on it
too it's like this warm peachy neutral
brownie color it has a v-neck line which
is really flattering on me and in the
backend some gold grommets that's was
like split off into another triangle
next thing I got is two pairs of denim
shorts I got these light blue little
distress sort of like mid rise all my
shorts are high-waisted but these are
just mid rise sort of like just basic
neutral denim shorts but you you need
these during the summer to style with
like everything so I just wanted to get
another pair I had so much like this but
then I got a black pair because
surprisingly I wear so much black but I
don't have like I have one pair of black
that I'm sure these ones are super
distressed seasons are high waisted so
Lulu is kind of known for having the
bomb is dresses ever I'm normally not a
dress person unless it's like a super
casual dress but I really really wanted
to get these ones these are just totally
those princess you want to like twirl
around on the beach and then they're so
long and flowy in Turley and pretty
versus where I'm going to show you is
this like warm peachy tone which I feel
like looks good on me it has a v-neck
line with these cute little straps that
like X in the back it's so super long
and just twirly and flowy I just love
the way it flows it's just so gorgeous
it has these like lighter pink stripes
on it I like jumped out of my comfort
zone I got a blue one this is sort of
like giving nautical vibe like that
light blue and white stripe
so this one is really strapping chest is
like a little bit more open than I would
like personally if I were only wear this
out I would put like a little like white
bra underneath to give some more
coverage but the back is all open and
you just sort of like tie around in the
back and the sides are a little bit open
this one is also just super long and
flowy this fabric is a little bit
thinner so it's going to be more
comfortable when it's like a really hot
summer day you want to wear a long dress
I got a third dress which this dress
actually if you watch my DC blog I tried
on a dress that looked sort of like this
this is just that sort of
straight-across neckline it's like this
beautiful olive green silk it has a
little corset action going on in the
fact that some small slits on the side
nothing crazy just to sort of make it
flow better and I have these pants I'm
obsessed with these so these are like
not teens but denim material sort of
like slurry pans like palazzo pant
they're a little bit distressed at the
ends a little bit distressed at the top
and they have front and back pockets the
back pockets your fake though
but I love the way that they flare I
love the way that they look just imagine
these pants with like the mules and like
a really cute black top like a perfect
just like nice dinner outfit I have
three tops left I have this mesh black
tank top I thought it was gonna be
see-through but it's not I put something
under it at the shoulders it just ties
off into these bows which I've been
loving that the next shirt also has like
both sleeves as well it's not cropped
it's just like a nice quality black tank
top you could throw this on over a
bathing suit just pair it with some
denim shorts like I said the next top
also has little Bose sleeve this top is
so just like classy and chic and pretty
like a flowy nude blouse that's off the
shoulder as you can tell I love
off-the-shoulder I wear them all the
time
it's perfect for the summer especially
when you just have a tan put some
highlighter on your shoulders I don't
know if you can tell I put a little bit
on there
the last thing talk that I got is this
really flowy just v-neck tank top these
in the back and has really low sides so
this is something that you could just
throw on top of your bathing suit or you
can wear like another little like lacy
tank top underneath like that would be
really cute too again just really simple
something you throw on in the summer
it's thin flowy fabric you're not going
to be hot so that is it for today's
aluminum summer haul give it a thumbs up
