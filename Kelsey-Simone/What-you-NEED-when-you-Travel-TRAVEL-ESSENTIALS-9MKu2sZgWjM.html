like a little travel essentials video as
the video goes up I will be in Paris so
I'm like pre filming this at home I'm
going to be in Paris for a whole week
and then the day I get back from Paris I
have like a couple of hours here and
then I'm leaving to go to California for
five days I'm going to Mexico over the
summer I'm going to New York a bunch DC
like I'm going to be traveling a lot so
I thought I'd show you like stuff to
throw in your carry-on just like stuff
I'm always going to have a new I'll
travel in just like my essential stuff I
know that'll always be in my backpack
I'm gonna be dead like I'm gonna die so
these things are just sort of gonna help
keep me alive while traveling I guess we
could just get started I have a bunch of
stuff like beauty fashion random stuff
music food like a bunch of stuff so the
good thing about my vlog camera is it'll
autofocus for me this is the first thing
this is lapis oil this is from herbivore
I know a lot of skincare brands sell it
who talked about how adorable that is
for a second it comes in this baby tiny
rollerball this isn't even like a travel
size this is just how it comes the
packaging is so adorable like this is so
cute look how tiny this is like I can
put this in my pocket like I can just
throw this in my bag it's amazing like
skincare is so very important especially
when you're flying your skin gets even
more dry and just sort of dehydrated and
my skin is dry already so having a
facial oil just in my little backpack is
so important for me I know that lapis
oil is really good for people who have
acne which I don't have a lot of acne it
just sort of like really helps balance
out my skin tone and just sort of like
refreshes it a little bit the next thing
speaking of rollerballs in the perfume
it's a little rollerball so roller balls
are easy to travel with they're small
you can just throw it in this is from
the brand replica and this is their
beach walk perfume I'm really happy I
finally got this because it's been sold
out in my Sephora forever and I finally
got the rollerball it's like the scent
of this okay it's perfect that they
called it Beach walk because it is like
a summery scent but it's like a
sophisticated summery scent it's not
like a typical like coconut sugary smell
yeah I really like this this is
definitely going to be like a summer
Paris a week in Paris during the summer
this is what that smells like
you always have smell of it that's very
important you always go to smell fresh
she was gosh smell nice okay okay okay
okay
this next product I'm not even
exaggerating this changed my lip game
forever so I have like a little bit on
right now I'm not even like wearing lip
color right now sorry but so this is
from fresh they sent me this and I'm not
normally like one to like try a lot of
like lip stuff like this like I normally
just put on like lip gloss like but
since they said me this of course I was
like let's give it a try like let's try
it okay so this is the sugar lip
treatment perfecting wand it perfects it
perfects let me tell you so it has this
sort of like bendable wand tip which is
really cool it's like this rubbery one
tip and on the front it's hard to see
but there's like all these little
exfoliating these little like abrasive
in use I don't know it cranks the bottom
there's already some up there it's not
clear gloss that comes out but this sort
of like pinky pearly Sheen it's really
pretty it's like almost clear when you
like rub it on your lips the little like
parts on it will exfoliate your lips and
makes your lips so soft it like pulls
all your dead skin off makes it super
soft but then this gloss part like
hydrates at the same time and it's just
amazing
your lips will be popping your lips will
be cool all the boys I forgot to wear my
look-alike is popping my lip gloss at
school I'm standing at my locker and all
the boys we stop it freshens really good
skincare which is also my next favorite
product this I never had this product
before they sent me a ton of stuff if
you follow me on my snapchat but this I
use the regular like facial moisturizer
my favorite facial moisturizer ever ever
ever is the Lotus youth preserve cream
from fret and this is the eye cream if
you guys know my mom she literally looks
younger than me she was fixed she's 12
and she taught me that um I creams
really important you're never too young
to start using like anti-aging stuff
because yes like it will like reduce the
appearance of wrinkles but it will also
have wrinkle prevention so especially
because in my last video I mentioned my
under eyes are the driest part of my
face like I always need to keep them
hydrated so this is really good I put
this on after I take off my makeup which
is a Mariola skin charity like if I'm
putting on
Oshin like I'll just dab a little bit of
it and put it on my under eyes and it
smells so that I'm really like sick
right now so that was gross sorry smells
just like it has a fresh it has a fresh
smell and it just basically smells like
cucumbers fresh-cut grass
cold breeze like it's very we go very
fresh smell I like it it's great
so sunglasses sunglasses are always
needed in the summer sunglasses always
need on vacation and I have a really big
problem I by way too many sunglasses you
guys know that from my haul but these I
need it I didn't need I didn't mean it
all but I wanted a lot so these sort of
they basically combined my two various
sunglasses I buy two pairs in one so I
very much wanted them these are from
Urban Outfitters they were like 20 bucks
so they're very inexpensive
I love the tortoiseshell like I feel
like love that look I have another pair
of glasses that are just like that but
they have like blue lenses they have
these Ray Bans that have like very sim
gold frames and they have this sort of
like black hombre lens and so these are
both of them together it's like the
tortoiseshell
with the golden frame but with the black
faded front and I love these get to toot
look at that attitude there's like so
much sass added to the look like
instantly I don't know what it is about
sunglasses that make me feel like ten
times cooler I don't know so first lives
are all the rage right now and being a
fashionista as you could say I'm a
fashionista you always deep down inside
you always want to look good like all
the time especially if you're like
traveling but sometimes when you feel
just dead
when you just feel dead you just want to
be comfortable you don't even care just
like whatever I just want to be
comfortable
these shoes combined both of those
things and one I love these shoes I'm
going to sit here to pet them for the
rest of the video there are these cream
super furry their fur all the way on the
bottom like fur on the top fur on the
bottom I think I've mentioned these on
my snapchat before they're from a
website called my mom made it she's in
the UK I think and she makes all of this
stuff herself and she was nice enough to
send these to me and I love them I put
them like this in my suitcase so they're
just like really easy to just like pack
on in there I don't want to just to my
face because they're my shoes but I can
easily use these
the pillow so you always need headphones
when traveling anywhere especially when
you're going on multiple hours of
flights you need headphones and I got
these ER headphones from guess where
guess what forever 21 so I also wish it
was like slightly more extra like I wish
they were like calming down besides
maybe even a little bit thicker
I might DIY it I don't know adorable
love it okay so the last thing I have is
going to save my life on the plane this
is the Vogue Paris collections magazine
which I've never seen this before like
I've never had these basically what it
is this tons of life this is the
fall/winter 2017-2018 collection so it
just was like tons of like runway looks
it's organized like by designer and it
also like shows you like all the
upcoming trends for shoes and bags and
accessories it's amazing like honestly I
feel like I like this because this is
sort of like my thing like I love
fashion I want to be in the fashion
industry so I love to sort of like
working out all of this stuff and just
sort of like studying it getting
inspiration looking at all the new
trends honestly it is so hot here and
like the breeze from the book feels so
good
I'm dying it's so hot in here okay so
the next thing I have is this snack so
I'm obsessed with Japanese kitchen
vitamin I got these at the Urban
Outfitters in the men's section like the
weirdest place ever um we actually have
like an oriental market where I live
where I like get all of my Japanese food
from but you know urban outfitters that
hit and then I use are like she lychee I
don't know how to say it but I say like
she but I've been corrected that it's
lychee but I'm still going to say like
II like she and melon just hard candy
but they're so good these are my two
favorite fruits like my two favorite
flavors of anything I'm tempted to eat
one now I forgot I was going to talk
about music because like with the
headphones thing I always listen music
when I'm on a plane well I have a
Spotify if you guys want to like go
follow me I don't honestly use Spotify
that much because I pay for Apple music
so I use that more but I do have like
some playlists on here that I do listen
to some of its kind of terrible don't
look through all
so when I am traveling I do like to
listen to my worship playlist I have
this bomb worship playlist it's like 10
hours long
actually I don't know if it's 10 hours
yeah I think we're like almost there but
I add to it all the time I get a lot of
like anxiety when traveling so listening
to this is just like so good and then I
also I have this like chill playlist
which actually isn't like that good the
bottom 11 songs of the chill playlist
are really good they're sort of like
those songs that like you see in like
travel vlogs like I normally listen to
that sort of music like just chill music
like just chill vibey music yeah oh and
I've got my supreme case on I don't know
if I'll change it for vacation but I
really like to supreme case because it's
mirrored so I can like always look at
myself oh yeah but that's it I didn't
think I would get through all that fast
for some reason I thought I had a lot
more I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I hope it was helpful hope you found
some new favorite stuff I'm so excited
to be travelling so much because

goal for life is just to like travel a
bunch and I finally am getting to do it
