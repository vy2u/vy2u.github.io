so for today's video I have my winter
trend allure and really excited the last
time I did one of these it was my fault
red Miller so I feel like I'm gonna do
these seasonally at the beginning of
each season to just sort of tell you
what's going to be the upcoming coolest
trends to be wearing in the season now I
feel like winter is pretty hard because
you have the struggle of trying to stay
warm while looking cute at the same time
no I don't live in California where I
live it gets pretty cold so I do
actually have to try to stay on trend
while not freezing to death at the same
time the first term that I have I feel
like it's a little bit expected for the
winter time but I still love it and I
think it's really cute so I wanted to
bring it up is chunky thick knit
oversized sweaters really big poofy I
love this one look how gigantic that is
look how puffy the sleeves are but for
the winter this is going to keep you so
warm and I think they look so cool at
the same time so I have this huge nude
one you guys have seen me wearing this
probably on snapchat the most this one
is from H&amp;amp;M this printed one is also
from H&amp;amp;M
I love the printed sweaters also from
H&amp;amp;M all three from H&amp;amp;M I have this
striped sweater because the best time to
wear striped sweater is all the time and
a quick little tip layering is key in
the winter you don't always have to
layer on the top you can also layer
underneath to like say if you have your
outfit already you're wearing this
sweater and you don't know wear a jacket
because you know sometimes a jacket just
ruins the outfit you like the way it
looks you can put another thick sweater
underneath of it to keep you warmer that
you won't see I always do that like not
even gonna lie I will wear leggings
underneath my jeans of course like not
ripped ones like say if I was wearing
these like I'll just put leggings
underneath you can't see them but it
makes you so much warmer now when it
comes to winter the number one question
I ask myself every morning is what coat
I feel like finding the perfect coat to
go with your outfit especially if it's
something dressier I mean like it's
pretty easy to find like a little denim
jacket a bomber jacket whatever but when
you're trying to look like nicer and
it's cold and you need a coat and you
don't know what to wear ver trench coats
have been my lifesaver for looking
glamorous and also not freezing to death
at the same time they definitely get
both the jobs done I've been loving the
longed-for trench coats I have this one
here this one's from H&amp;amp;M of this nude
one you've probably seen this on my
Instagram before it has like these black
tie tassels so it like ties like a robe
I think it's really cool this black one
that I have is from I am Gia this one is
super thick like honestly these are
probably like my most warm thickest
coats but they're also like my most
glamorous at the same time this one that
I have is from my mum beta it's like
this dark brown and then under the
collar it has red so you can still look
super extra without ruining your outfit
you know what I'm saying next time that
I have is this I've been obsessed with
Berets lately I don't know they're the
most adorable thing is that how I don't
have a mirror so I can't see I think
that's it I don't really have a mirror
to see right now but is this not
adorable wintertime is hat season you
have to keep your dome warm and a hat
will exactly do that oh my god dr. Seuss
ooh hat is an amazing way to accessorize
your outfit while staying warm at the
same time and this just happens to be
one then I really really like there's
not a lot of hats that I think look good
on my head but are you to really like
the Berets I love the Parisian look I
think it's so elegant I think it's so
beautiful and classy the next trend that
I have I know this is not for everybody
I've been really obsessed with the
tortoiseshell look so first it started
off with sunglasses I just loved the
whole tortoiseshell sunglasses thing
these ones I got from Zappa they're like
this cool hat
you've seen these in a video before and
then I got this bag when I was in New
York for Fashion Week
I got it at this really random boutique
I found I don't even remember what it
was called but I was obsessed with this
just sort of like this glass looking box
it's not it's plastic I think it has
this long gold chain and I've posted
this on my Instagram it's one of those
things that I haven't seen tons of
people wearing but I feel like tons of
people are going to start wearing it the
next time that that I have is track
pants I've been loving track pants I've
seen them a ton in stores lately
especially track suits where it comes
with like the top and the bottom the
first pair that I have are these they
look like this it says polo sport I
would honestly even wear it with like a
top like this I love the juxtapose of
like the girly and the sporty or like
grungy all mixed together these ones
that I have are more like sweatpants
because of the material but they do
comment with a matching track jacket
these ones are from iridium which is one
of my favorite stores they're gray they
have this like structure down the middle
and then this print down the side which
is really cool I'm not really sure what
it is it's just like a triangle like a
little thingy in it so the last trend of
that I have for you is something that
I've been wearing a while and I've seen
it being consistently worn and loved by
people and I think it's just gonna last
throughout the winter I love it I'm not
going to stop flying in I'm obsessed
with silk so first I have these two
blouses I thrifted both of them look how
it catches the light like is that not so
pretty silk is one of those things that
I find a lot in thrift stores especially
little slip dresses which I know are
super popular right now I love slip
dresses I have some myself and then I
have these silky pants I have a couple
pairs of silky pants I have like three
pairs of black silk pants
just because I mean I love them I think
it's so nice and it's also something
that you could definitely wear to like
spell on the floor these ones are from
Urban Outfitters they were like $30 you
don't have to pay that much for so even
though it looks very expensive but
because it has that look it's normally
something that I end up wearing what I'm
like going out to an event or dinner
because it has that more sort of dressed
up look even though it's something super
simple and then I have this body - also
from my mom made it if you want some
nice silky pieces I really recommend
checking her out of course I'll have all
the clothes links in the description but
this is just like a little ruched
bodysuit it has like ties here but I
normally wear this with pants so you
don't see these but yeah I think it's so
pretty and I really like the ruching on
this I think it adds a really nice
detail so those are all of the winter
trends of that I have for this video I
hope you got some inspiration I hope you
even got some knowledge from this video
if you enjoyed it please give it a
thumbs up to let me know that I should
keep doing these so that I'll eventually
film like a spring one in a summer one
and keep going for the seasons don't

favorite winter trends you could share
