little bit festive and like wear this
like tiara crown thing but Rachel's
birthday is two days after Christmas
which is obviously a little bit more
important so I decided to wear a crown
because even on her special day I'm
still queen so today I'm going to be
filming a video for you got this is
falling off I'm going to be filming a
video for you guys I'm going to do kind
of like a winter holiday favorites slash
essentials slash room decoration slash
inspiration it's just a video I'm gonna
start off with some of my favorite
things okay the first favorite I'm going
to start off with is candles and I have
two candles
I love lighting candles because um I
don't know why it makes things smell
good it makes things festive II and I
normally don't like candles unless it's
Christmas because I feel like I'm going
to burn my house down so it makes it a
little bit more special if you only do
it once a year this one I have is winter
and from Bath and Body Works as you can
see I've already lit it a bunch um and
it has cute little snowflakes on the top
which I really like the next candle I
have is um wish and it's Christmas spice
and I honestly are these from Bath and
Body Works just kidding I take that back
these aren't from but this one is that
I'm not sure but it has the same exact
top but it doesn't say Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
on it which is kind of weird but yeah so
this one kind of just smells like
cinnamon and the winter one kind of
smells like like a campfire I guess you
could say okay by the way I brought
winter Oreos with me because to be
honest one am I like not snacking in my
videos in my videos so next I'm going to
move on to makeup and on for makeup I
have this like lip duo that I am
actually using on my lips right now it
is a NARS lip duo this one is in the
color damn'd which is a sinner's word um
so we're just going to say darned and
this one is in dragon girl kind of like
that name so this one is like a really
like
vibrant sort of red and I'm not a
vibrant red sort of girl so I take the
darker plum er one and I kind of just
like put that on top of it so I like mix
them together so it just like is like a
darkened version of this one kind of
like lipliners you can use them as lip
liners but like I fold my lips in with
them so it's like perfect for both my
next makeup favourite is this it is my
Mario Badescu not a hundred percent sure
if that's how you pronounce the name if
it's not sorry Mario so this is a facial
spray and it's made with rose water and
aloe and it's just like it smells
amazing
so I use this twice I use it before I
put on my makeup when my face is clean
and then I also use it on once make if
it's done as like a setting spray sort
of thing so yeah I love it it smells
good um it's a really good setting spray
and it's just like really refreshing
when you don't have makeup on so yeah I
actually purchased this at Urban
Outfitters the next makeup favorite I
have is my Kat Von D um tattoo concealer
which as you can see I literally I need
a new one
it is amazing though I love it so much
it gives perfect coverage um and I have
it a shade lighter than my natural skin
tone or my foundation color I guess you
could say so I use it to highlight under
my eyes my forehead my nose and my chin
um and it is just amazing I use it in
the color light because I'm pale already
on top of it being winter I am
SuperDuper pale so the next thing I have
it's not really makeup it's a product
but we're just going to like throw this
in there it's not really wintery either
but you know the next thing I have is a
product and it is this shampoo and
basically it is um oil is just like you
know all those fancy tools people put in
their hair like Moroccan oil and like
all that stuff so it smells so good and
I've been using it a lot as you can see
and the bottle is just like really like
aesthetic II I like it goes with my
aesthetic it goes with my theme it's
black and white what other colors do you
need this scent like lasts in my hair
like it's not like I put it in wash it
and it smells good after I wash it and
like after Wally you can smell it for a
pretty long time in my hair and um I
really like it yes we can
move on to like random or should we do
fashion we're moving on to fashion so
the first thing I have in fashion is
this and oh my gosh can we just talk
about how much I love this this is um a
um duster pretty sure it's called a
duster it kind of looks like a bathrobe
if you but you have to style it the
right way to make it not look like a
bathrobe so it is like this nudie sort
of yellowy camel it's camel colored and
it's just long-sleeve and it has pockets
and it's pretty long if you watch my
last video I did style this um and I
wear it literally over top of everything
because the only thing I don't like
about winter fashion is wearing a really
cute outfit and then you have to like
put a coat over it and it kind of ruins
it so I love this because it's really
really thick like it is wool it is so
thick and it looks cute over your outfit
so I definitely think it's a really good
investment to get one of these then got
it the next thing I have is these um
knee-high boots which are healed which I
also styled in my last video um by the
way self promo go check out my last
video it was an outfit of the week like
a little like a little V back there I
think it's solely Q so yeah they just
have heels and they're not like this
skinny heels because I feel like the
skinny ones can look a little like iffy
if you know what I'm saying
but like the thicker ones I'm a lot more
comfortable with these especially like
on an everyday basis sort of thing
because they do like wearing them a lot
and then my next favorite I'm wearing
right now which is a turtleneck and
turtlenecks are my favorite um right now
for Christmas I love Christmas
not just goes most winter I love
especially crop turtlenecks this one's
cropped can't stubble this my last video
- oh my gosh I'm pretty sure I styled it
with my duster so um yeah it's just a
long sea turtle eggs from forever 21 by
the way the boots were front and
forever21
if anybody wanted to know it's just
ribbed and it's cropped and it's black I
really want to get one in probably like
gray too so now moving on to randoms the
first thing I have is these miracles
these are amazing these are furry
slippers
the firt the furriest furry slippers
i've ever seen
they're so pretty they're so cute
they're again aesthetically themed
because they're like nudie whites like
they go um with everything I could
literally probably wear these out
probably not what I would I got these
from Urban Outfitters last year my mom
actually bought them and I stole them
from her this year and she still doesn't
like she still haven't figured out that
I've stolen them so um they're kind of
mine oh thanks mom I really like them
and I'm not sure if they sell them
anymore they're so soft
another winter essential that you're
going to need is a blanket and this is
my beloved blanket this is yes this is
the blanket I used in my purpose video
it is on my bed and actually the
background of a lot of my videos if I'm
right but I love this blanket I got it
from Marshalls
I don't remember how long ago but it's
just like it's like dark brown on the
bottom but I like to use the top
obviously because it's like this like
frosty white color I like frosty white
using that now the brown underneath as
you can see so it like gives off like in
effect I don't really know what I'm
talking about now I don't really have
know how to like talk about blankets
besides it's soft and pretty
the next um essential must-have for
Christmas is obviously Christmas movies
and there's so many good Christmas movie
this is just for but I own like 5
million and then the rest of them I
watch off Netflix I have Christmas with
the Kranks this is my number one
favorite Christmas movie I love this
movie it is amazing it is so funny and I
watch it like 4 times a year I could
probably recite this okay so we have How
the Grinch Stole Christmas everybody
knows this movie everybody loves it
I am the Grinch the Grinch is mean he's
my spirit animal we just kind of like
understand each other then we have elf
and everybody knows this Christmas movie
I know so cliche Kelsey you don't have
to comment about it I already know but
okay I love this movie just saying just
just putting out there then we have this
movie that terrified me as a child I
still have nightmares about it and it
scares the crap out of me
still does
there's a blue smiley face sticker on it
but it is the Christmas carol with Jim
Carrey leave you lovin Jim Carrey cuz I
loved him Carrie he's amazing
um it is blue rain DBG this movie it was
the first ghost the Christmas past that
scared me it still haunts me every day
um but yeah it's a great movie next
thing that we have on I kind of don't
really have a food section because all
the Christmas snacks I did have I kind
of ate already um sorry about that this
is all I have this is pretty much all I
eat in the winter anyway besides
peppermint flavored um Kit Kats but I
drink tea I drink tea like three times a
day like not even joking I am
home-schooled and I drink tea to wake me
up in the morning like that's the first
thing I do look for even eat breakfast
is I drink a cup of tea and I like
peppermint tea in the winter obviously
pepper may winter so on and plus I got
this cute little snowflake mug don't
know where actually sorry about that
oops the flake mugs and I had tons of
hair the next thing about Christmas that
is essential is your decorations you
need cute decorations for Jimmy
Christmastime that's how I know it's
Christmas on like September first I go
and decorate my entire room so I bring
up the Christmas tree I bring up the
lights blue balls
um the first thing I have is obviously
my Christmas tree I have a miniature
white Christmas tree I'm pretty sure I
got this from Target like three years
ago my mom bought a bigger one off
Amazon and I'm kind of mad that she
won't let me have it I really want it
I also strength Christmas lights around
my room because first of all they're so
cute and like Christmassy I kind of
probably keep these up all year but I
just like string them differently during
Christmas I also put little Christmasy
things around my room like little
glittery trees and little white flowers
and little candles snowflakes you know
anything Christmasy I could possibly
find I stick it in my room the next
thing we need is Christmas music so I'm
grabbing my phone I always listen to
Christmas music during Christmas duh I
listen to Chris
when it's not even Christmas tbh goes
way back this is like a Christmas
classic everybody knows this everybody
loves this this been around like Frank
Sinatra time like nobody because I'm
single
ooh Christmas dubstep that's a thing
let's look
