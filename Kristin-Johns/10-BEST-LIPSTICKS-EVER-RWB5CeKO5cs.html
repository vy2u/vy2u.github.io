you what my ten favorite lipsticks of
all time like my world's best lipsticks
and I thought this would just be a fun
random video to share with you guys I
feel like I'm always wearing a different
lipstick so it's hard for me to narrow
down like my 10 favorite that I would
choose over any other in the whole world
but in this little pink bag I have all
of my favorite lipsticks I'm going to be
doing lip swatches and hand swatches and
all that good stuff
but before we start I just want to say
we did it get a new puppy she's in she's
in the other room with Marcus right now
sleeping so I didn't want to bother her
but I will bring her in here and by the
end of the video so you guys can see her
if you don't follow me and Marcus's
channel or you don't follow me on social
media cuz she is the cutest sweetest
little puppy ever her name is honeybee
so yeah I just wanted to address that
really quick because I know I'll be
getting a lot of questions about her I
feel like I should start more on the
noon side and then go to the brighter
ones because for this video I wanted to
kind of give a good range of colors like
I didn't just want to pick all of my
favorite mob shades of lipstick because
you guys know that's my favorite type of
lipstick but I have a very good mixture
of everything I'll start with this one
because this one is probably going to be
the most controversial at least it is in
my head because I just got this very
recently and it's like how can you say
that this is one of your favorite
lipsticks of all time when you only had
it for a few weeks but you just you just
kind of know and this is the type of
color I have been on the search for
forever I feel like this shade like this
is my favorite shade anyway this is a
two-faced lipstick in a Sunday Funday it
has very beautiful packaging and then it
looks like this it's a lighter nude than
I'm used to but it just looks so pretty
on the lips that's what I'm wearing
today
over a darker lip liner and the reason
that this one got put in my top 10
favorite lipsticks of all time
is because the shade mixed with the
formula and the smell the packaging
everything all just adds up like I took
all those things into account with all
of my lipsticks so everything about it
is just perfect I know I'm going to be
going through this and then I'm gonna
have to buy another and another and
another and that's when you know that
you love a lipstick I've been wearing
this pretty much every single day since
I got it and it's just beautiful and
another reason why it's beautiful to me
is because Marcus even said wow that's
one of my favorite lip colors that
you've ever worn and he never
compliments my makeup usually like
because I usually wear the same makeup
every day and then he called put into me
on this and I was like wow that is a
special one okay so moving on to another
lighter color this one is by Revlon I
don't think I've ever mentioned this
lipstick on my channel before but I wear
it a ton and this is actually my second
tube of it and this is the number 672
Brazilian tan I feel like these are the
best lipsticks at the drugstore here is
what this shade looks like it's a little
bit more warm toned than Sunday Funday
they do look very similar but this one
has kind of more of a yellowy base I
feel like and this one of course is way
more affordable than the Too Faced one I
also sometimes like pairing this one
with a darker lip liner and it just
gives at least for my skin tone it's
like the perfect nude shade so I've been
using this shade that since like high
school and I just had to put it in here
because it really is one of my favorite
lipsticks of all time okay the next
lipstick that I wanted to mention is
from Mac this is the cream Sheen in the
color cream in your coffee if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
would have already guessed that this
would be in my top 10 favorites I
actually used this in the first makeup
tutorial I ever posted on YouTube and
sometimes I watch that video and I just
cringed so much and then I think about
deleting it but I can't because of the
memories but yeah I wouldn't recommend
it
and watching that tutorial anyway I was
using this shade in that video and I
have loved the shade for ever you can
see that I'm used so much of it and I
think this is my third or fourth tube of
it it's just a beautiful mauve shade but
I think it's more than that I think it
kind of has very undertones and then the
formula of it also is very hydrating it
makes your lips just look super smooth
I've also got a ton of comments from you
guys saying that you've bought this
lipstick because of how many times I've
talked about it and then you love it too
so this is just one of the best everyday
every-night lipsticks ever this is the
melted matte liquid lipstick in the
shade sell out
I love Too Faced liquid lipsticks I feel
like they actually make my lips look way
bigger when I have them on it's so weird
because you wouldn't think that liquid
lipsticks have any plumping properties
but I really feel like these do this
lipstick actually I get so many comments
on when I'm in public of people asking
me what lipstick I'm wearing I don't
know why I just always remember this
shade I've been asked like a million
times just another great everyday one
that will actually stay on your lips a
really long time the other three that I
mentioned you have to kind of reapply
throughout the day and this next shade
is my last nudie color so don't worry
this is Kat Von D's Lolita liquid
lipstick you know what I feel like the
reason this has such a cool following
behind it like when it first came out it
was sold out 24/7 it's because it really
is the perfect 90s Mavi nude brown color
and the formula of these liquid
lipsticks is incredible so long-lasting
not drying on me at least and just
really really stays on your lips so well
next up I have a shade from colour-pop
that I actually got recently I think I
got this about a month ago
this is the ultra satin lip and I think
this was a collaboration with some
but I can't really tell and this is in
the shade missus but this shade is very
unique to me at least because it's a
very warm toned pinky color like it's
almost like a very muted coral color but
it's just super wearable it just looks
so beautiful on color top as you guys
probably know is super affordable which
I love about them and they're ultra
satin lips are amazing
maybe it's called misses because it's a
good wedding day color I feel like this
is a good wedding day color okay now I'm
going to move on to the deeper colors
like and the more brighter colors this
one is the Tarte lip paint in the shade
front row I really like the applicator
of this because it has that little dip
in it and I feel like it's just really
easy to apply on your lips these are
actually a little bit more drying on me
the Tarte ones but they stay on really
well and I mean this shade is just
beautiful and I feel like this is the
perfect fall color it just looks so good
on and it's like a rich warm rosy color
that's how I would describe I don't know
I'm not very good at describing colors
but that's how to describe this one the
next one I absolutely love this color so
much I wear this all the time this is
Kylie cosmetics matte liquid lipstick in
the shade - and also have the lip liner
that I pair it with a shade 22 is a deep
deep orange red this is what the
applicator looks like I really like
Kylie's applicators they're so soft and
like fluffy they just feel very good
going on lips and her lip liners are
even better than her lipsticks you can
tell I've used this one so much it's
actually I really need to sharpen that
you guys might be like oh I don't know
about an orange lipstick because I know
a lot of people are kind of scared of
orange lipsticks but this one is so
beautiful and it's very very wearable
okay so this is the bite high pigment
lip pencil in the shade
bramble and I actually bought my mom
this color for Mother's Day and then I
loved it so much that I was like I have
to get that myself so this is a really
pretty deep berry color you have to be
very careful when applying them because
they are so pigmented but it's nice
because you do get that point of the
pencil which is helpful when you're
applying it how to show you my favorite
red this is the Smashbox liquid lipstick
in the shade
and this shade makes your teeth look so
white because it has those blue
undertones in it it's very like juicy
and it doesn't make your lips feel dry
at all and I just love this shade of red
it's so pretty it lasts on your lips it
doesn't get on your teeth so many of my
red lipsticks and get on my teeth right
away and I haven't had that problem with
this one okay guys those were she's
already popping up I wanted to surprise
you guys but those were my top ten
favorite lipsticks of all time let me
know if you guys have any overlaps like
if any of those were your favorites but
before I go I wanted to show you guys

tiny and adorable campers actually right
