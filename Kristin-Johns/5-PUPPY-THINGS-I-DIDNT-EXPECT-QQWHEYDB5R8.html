gonna be telling you five things that I
did not expect about having a puppy this
is my puppy right here if you don't
follow me on my other social media where
I've been posting about him practically
every single day he is a Golden
Retriever puppy and he's so sweet
but there are a lot of things about him
that I did not expect when we got him
hopefully he will be in this video a lot
that's why I'm sitting on the floor to
tighten those chances but he might go
away somewhere else so I really hope you
stay but I won't bring if you don't this
is what he decided he'll do he'll sit
here and with my leg okay so like I said
I'm going to be going through such he's
fighting the tripod right now he's
literally gnawing the tripod okay so the
first thing I definitely didn't expect
about having a puppy is kind of
something about me kind of learned
something about myself I learned that I
am a horrible disciplinarian thought
that I would be good at disciplining
because I know how important it is and I
know you have to discipline puppies
because then they'll never learn it they
never get discipline I get very very sad
when I have to say no to him or I have
to discipline him I just get so sad like
the other day I was sitting outside with
him and I was eating some food and he
kept barking at me and jumping up and
biting me and I hadn't really really
disciplined because then he bit me on my
arm it hurts so bad it's been after I
disciplined him I started getting really
sad because I think I really hurt his
feelings cause he was just looking at me
like really really bad and his Marcus
walked outside and I started crying
because I felt so bad that I disciplined
them that's how much of a softy I am
when it comes to this planation but
marks on the other hand is amazing it
discipline
him.the really respect Marcus because
Marcus lays down the law and he really
is firm with him which has actually made
camper really respect and listen to
markets like Marcus will say no an
immediately camper will stop but if I
say no campers just like what have to
get better at that that's something I
was not expecting I was expecting me to
be very good at disciplining I just
wanted was going to be the disciplinary
woman that I needed to be but he's way
too cute and it makes me feel so sad
when I have to get mad at him so that is
the first thing that I didn't expect
about having a puppy the second thing
about camper that was a little bit
unexpected and it's going to sound kind
of weird but it's true it's true he is
so smart and I was not expecting him to
be so clever and smart at such a young
age I know that old retrievers are
always just known as very very smart
dogs but I didn't realize that at 11
weeks old he would be as smart as he is
I wouldn't say she is a very very
obedient puppy he really does like to
push the limits I would say oh but he
knows right away when he's done
something bad he knows that if he
grabbed a piece of garbage out of the
trash in and you look at him he knows he
did something wrong and he'll sprint
away and try to hide in a little crevice
that we won't find him in another reason
I know that he's so smart is because he
learned how to sit the first time we
ever try to teach him how to sit and
don't get me wrong he still has a lot of
training to do she's not like perfect or
anything like that but just the fact
that he's so smart at 11 weeks old
really really surprised me smart and
clever can you know you just expect
puppies to just be kind of like aloof
and not really knows going on but he
knows he's very very smart
number three would definitely have to be
the fact that I'm so so attached to him
which I knew I would be attached to
because I love animals and just having
my first dog ever I knew I would be
attached but I am so attached to him
anytime you have to leave the house
I am singing about him the whole time
and I'm just digging pool he's probably
so sad that we're gone first four days
that we had campers I'm not even joking
I did not leave the house one time and I
spent every waking second with him for
four days straight because I was so
attached to him and I just wanted to
spend every second with him since then
me and marks had talking pizzas because
you have to live your life you can't
just stay at home forever so I have been
going out and doing my own thing and
I've left him behind sometimes but that
just goes to show that I am so attached
to him and I just always want to be with
him I want him to feel super super
bonded to me which we do have a pretty
special bond which makes me really happy
the next thing that I was not expecting
about camper is that we have so many
different personality quirks I know a
lot of dogs have their different things
but obviously you can't expect what your
dog's personality quirks will be and one
of my favorite ones is that he loves
sleeping in really tight places
it looks like he's trapped always when
he's sleeping but it's just that he
likes to feel really enclosed when he's
sleeping and I actually took a video of
one of his favorite spots before I
started this video so I'll insert that
here
Kim Kim / hey hey he just loves little
tiny spaces and since it's really cute
another really funny thing that he does
well it's actually kind of him in Marx's
bin when he's being absolutely insane
like sprinting around going crazy
fighting barking doing all the puppy
things the only way to calm him is for
markets to pick him up and hold him
upside down like a baby and right away
he just goes like right when I can't
really do that cuz he's getting so big
already he just feels probably
uncomfortable in my bony arms because he
does not fall asleep like that like he
does Marcus okay can't be you got to be
in the last in the last point cabling I
wish each and every single one of you
could squeeze him and pet
you would just really follow and last
thing about getting a puppy that I was
not expecting the extent of what it is
is how much it feels like he completed
our little family it really feels like
now we are a little family because he
just he's like our little baby now we
feel like we're taking care of something
together and raising something together
it's just so fun to take care of
something and be responsible for
something with Marcus because it kind of
feels like we're parents we are parents
of a little tiny puppy I can't even
imagine my life without him now which I
know all of this sounds so cheesy and I
don't know but it's all true so I was
going to say it but I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this but I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video if you
guys have pets of any type maybe comment

you figured out while having your first
pet but I love you guys I hope that you
