you five things that I didn't expect
about marriage this is like a little
series that I'm going to start doing on
my channel I already did five things
that I didn't expect about having a
puppy I'll link that down below if you
guys haven't seen it but today I decided
that it would be interesting to talk
about the things that I have experienced
in marriage that I was not expecting
because before you get married you don't
really know exactly what it's going to
be like when you are married because
we've never been married before so I
feel like there has been a lot of things
that I've been like well I wasn't
expecting that the first thing I didn't
expect was how easy it is and this might
sound kind of weird but I promise it's
not weird because pretty much me and
Marcus's entire relationship a lot of
you guys already know it was
long-distance we did long-distance for
over two and a half years and we had
only dated in the same city for like
four or five months when Marcus left to
California so pretty much our entire
relationship getting to know each other
spending time with each other was all
long-distance and I think that the
number one thing that people were
nervous about was how we would do when
you were actually living together since
we had never really lived for a while in
the same city so a lot of people look we
got married we're like you need to move
to the same city before you are actually
married because it's going to be way
different then when you just go and
visit in for a week and then come back
and see him like every other month we
really knew that we were going to get
married and we didn't want to wait and I
didn't want to move to LA before being
married I feel like our everyday lives
are like a super easy flow and like a
good rhythm like we never really argue
about being together too much like I
know some couples that can get sick of
each other but we're never really sick
of each other and I just feel like he
can do his thing I can do my thing and
it's never really an issue so I'm really
glad that we kind of like trusted
ourselves and let me trust our
relationship and definitely don't get me
wrong
marriage is not
I'm not saying marriage in general is
easy you definitely have to work for
your marriage and you have to put a lot
of effort into it but I'm just saying
like day to day life with Marcus is not
hard for us you know what I'm saying
okay number two on my list is how much
of a nurturer
I am so before Marcus I obviously had
never lived as a boy before in high
school and all my childhood I lived as
my parents and then in college I had
roommates for four years and I just
always thought of myself as someone that
wasn't like a real really like nurturing
person like I loved being with people
and hanging out with people but I didn't
think of myself as someone that was like
always wanting to take care of everybody
like I know a lot of girls that are like
the mom of the group what they're always
taking care of everyone and making sure
everyone's okay and I never really felt
like that so it was interesting because
once I got married I really feel like my
nurturing knit really came out like I
always want Marcus to have like a nice
meal and I always like to keep the house
really clean when I lived in house with
my roommates I didn't really like it
didn't really bother me if the house was
messy it just kind of bothered me if my
own room was messy saw before I got
married I was like I wonder if I'm
really going to care if my house is
dirty or if I'm going to be like always
cleaning and definitely the latter is
true I'm always cleaning always cooking
I feel like I'm always doing stuff
around the house so and I really like
doing that stuff so I feel like that is
another thing that I did really expect
about marriage or I didn't really expect
about myself and marriage has really
brought it out in me the third thing I
didn't expect is how special it is to
wake up and go to sleep with your
husband or your wife but in my case my
husband oh my gosh
morning times and night times are my
favorite like waking up in the morning
and just like having someone next to me
is my favorite thing in the whole world
and now when Marcus is like out and he's
not home at night
I'm trying to fall asleep I find it so
hard to fall asleep without him having
him there next to me in the mornings and
night times has really become my
favorite thing ever
and especially night times it just feels
like a slumber party just like sleeping
next to your best friend and we just
been watching the office and it's just
so fun like I really look forward to
make times and mornings usually during
the day we're both super busy and like
doing different things but I know in the
mornings and night times I just like
cherish that time that we can spend
together the next thing is the only
negative on my list and it's not having
to do with Marcus really but the fourth
thing that I didn't expect is how
judgmental strangers can be about me
being married there's just been so many
times where people have seen my wedding
ring and then they're they're like oh my
gosh how old are you and then I tell
them and they're like my gosh you got
married so young blah blah but it's
almost never like oh my gosh
while you're married at all it's always
like they're like shook quiet like
they're really surprised that I'm
married I was checking out at t.j.maxx
and this guy was talking to me the
cashier it's almost always guys that are
like the most rude about it and he saw
my wedding ring he was like oh are you
married and I was like yeah and he was
like how old are you and I told him I
was 21 because it was a few weeks ago
and he was just like why would you get
married so young like he was so like why
would you get married sitting around
like oh whoa we had been dating for a
while and like when you know they're the
one they're the one and he's just like
but like you can't go and party and like
are you sure like he's the one for you
like you never want to like date other
people ever again I'm like yeah I don't
want to date anybody else and I don't
really go clubbing really so it's not a
problem for me and I don't know he was
just like oh wow he's just like judging
me so hard and I just think that's so
weird I don't think people should ever
be like that like if you're married
young you just want to spend the most
to life you can with that person that
you love yeah that's probably one thing
I did really expect but I guess I more
expected it to happen from people that I
knew but no one that I knew ever acted
like that and I don't know it's just
weird that it happens with strangers and
the last thing that they didn't expect
about marriage is kind of hard to
explain but I wrote down the spiritual
bond that marriage creates and gives you
in your husband because um it is really
hard to explain but ever since me and
Marcus got married I just feel like such
a deep spiritual and emotional
connection to him that even as close as
we are when we were dating it wasn't
even anywhere near the amount of just
like respect and consideration that we
give each other now people had told me
that too before everybody know what they
mean but it's really true it's so weird
like sometimes I just feel like me and
Marcus can read each other's mind it's
very strange and then we'll just be like
whoa how are we all like such the same
wavelength all of that we've been
married for almost six months now I feel
like I can read his emotions way better
now and I just like understand more of
the reasons behind his actions I
remember when we were not married I
would always be like I don't understand
my Marcus that did that all right like
sometimes he would just confuse me and
now I never really feel confused because
I just like know his thought process
better and that might just be from all
the time that we spend together but I
really feel like it's a deeper thing
than that and I'm sure if Marcus McTeer
he would say the same thing because it's
really true like when you're married you
just know like that person is your
person and they're your number one
person in the whole world and you have
to just love them the most but those are
five things that I didn't expect about
marriage overall I would say marriage is
everything I expected and more
and the more is like things that I
didn't expect but are still good things
