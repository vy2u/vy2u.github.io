I honestly don't even know what the heck
video is but I woke up this morning and
I wasn't feeling super happy and I
wasn't feeling I just wasn't feeling my
best I just wasn't feeling bubbly and I
didn't feel like putting on makeup or
putting on cute clothes so I was
thinking about not doing a video for
today because I was thinking you know
what I can't always be my happiest self
on the camera because I don't know I
just get so many comments all the time
from people saying how are you so happy
all the time and I wish I could be as
happy as you all time I'm just thinking
that's sad
sure people would think that for people
to have a false expectation of what life
could be I guess if that makes any sense
because I am NOT happy all the time I
don't know why I'm crying already I
don't know I just wanted to make this
video so that you guys could know that
like life isn't happy all the time you
know let me compose myself really quick
okay I think I'm okay now but I just
wanted to make this video because I I
know that social media can portray
people lives in a way that's not true
like of course on Instagram and YouTube
I am probably not going to be crying and
posting horrible pictures because I mean
you want to toast the best part of your
day the best part of your week you don't
want to post when you've laid in bed
since 11 o'clock and do really sad and
you don't feel like doing anything all
day which has been my day today so this
morning I was laying in bed and I was
like you just need to film a video and
you just need some video like how you
actually are right now because
I mean I just want to just fake a smile
and do like a makeup tutorial or
something like that because that's just
I'm just so not in the mood to do that
so I didn't want to fake it and do it if
that makes any sense maybe not just a
few bad youtuber reason I think that I'm
feeling kind of sad right now is because
I will open my throat right now and I
can feel the cry that come up into my
eyes but I'm going to really try not to
cried it
the reason that I'm sad is because my
sister and husband and then little baby
has been at my house for the past two
weeks and we have my mom here too and
they just left yesterday so when I moved
LA two months ago a little over two
months ago maybe um I was really missing
my friends my mom and my sister and
everyone like that um but then things
got easier cuz you get you sitting away
from everybody but then having them all
here it just made me remember what it
was like being around family all the
time and I think that's why I'm just
feeling sad today because my family is
so important to me and it just got me
thinking about how much I miss my
friends and everything like that so
that's why I didn't really feel like
filming a happy video today and and the
laws are just started going up the log
guy is here anything
maybe that will buy me some time to calm
it down calm it down
so it's a lawnmower stopped and I had
some time to regain my composure so
hopefully now I can get through this
video without crying what I was saying
with basically that it has been really
hard to be so far away from my friends
and my family and there are days that
I'm just really sad and that I just
can't even bring myself to post on
social media because it just feels like
when I am in a bad mood and I post
something happy on social media I just
feel like I feel this cognitive
dissonance Thank You psychology for
teaching me about that but I really do
feel like a weird like it just I don't
feel right doing it I guess so so I
didn't want to
that today and I thought it might be a
good way to tell you guys just an
important message about how how much
social media isn't reality all the time
of course there are great parts about
social media that I love so much I love
posting key pictures and tweeting about
happy things in snapchat my day and
stuff like that but sometimes I I get
annoyed sometimes if I'm in a really bad
mood and I see all of these happy
positive people online I can get jealous
I can start comparing myself I can just
get upset by the whole thing and I just
want you guys to know every single
person goes through sad times and and in
social media is just the best part of
people's lives and I just thought that
that is an important thing to talk about
and I know I've talked about that on my
channel before in a couple of videos but
I haven't talked about it in a while
thought probably a lot of you could
relate to my sadness right now because
I'm sure a lot of you live far away from
your friends or family and it can be so
hard and it can feel just so lonely like
right now I just feel lonely even though
I have Marcus and he is like my rock
like if I did not have Marcus I'd be so
sad out here but he's out today with his
friends cuz his friends came in town and
um I know I'm just feeling like the
weight of loneliness being away from my
friends and family I guess especially
just because the last like three weeks
I've been with them every single day I
think I just have really really a hard
time with the goodbyes March was like
Kristin you've been with them for three
weeks like aren't you just like happy
for all that time that you got spend
with them I'm like yes but I just think
I am really bad at saying it back like
when me and Marcus were doing
long-distance I would cry so hard every
single time we had to say goodbye which
I'm sure that's completely normal but I
just know I really get so sad and I have
to say bye to people it just I think
that's the biggest thing I miss about
living close to everybody it's just like
the community right now cameras bringing
out all of my clothes out of my closet
but I don't feel like giving up stuff
you'll have fun with those I'm not
saying that I don't have friends out
here in LA um but everyone's just super
busy in a way it seems like like I
definitely do have good friends here but
it's not the same and obviously it's not
going to be the same but like living in
college all your roommates and having
them hang out all the time but it's just
a hard transition I guess and maybe if
any of you guys are lonely maybe this
will help you because you can know that
I feel lonely sometimes and everyone
feels lonely sometimes I'm sorry I'm
trying to like make this video have a
point so I'm not just sitting here on
YouTube crying to people but mainly I
just really want you guys to know two
things one everybody has hard days not
every day is perfect and people even
that seem like they have the best life
so happy are definitely not happy all
the time and I just want you guys to
know that and to just know that social
media isn't always reality it's just
like the most beautiful version of
people's reality I think I'm going to
get myself out of my pajamas and I'm
going to go to Target because I love
Target and I'm going to go grocery
shopping and I'll take camper for a walk
by the way campers doing great um I need
to call a puppy class today because we
need to start getting him in puppy
training because that's super important
and yeah so I hope it I don't even know
if you could enjoy this video but I hope
you guys appreciate this video because
it is really hard for me sometimes to be
completely to like show the deepest part
of my heart
on the internet like I always feel like
I am being genuine but it is hard to
show like your raw so to the camera you
know so I hope you guys appreciated this
video and if any of you guys are feeling
lonely or sad or having a hard day just
know that we'll get through it and
tomorrow is a new day and I'm Andy
Kaufman I love you guys and I hope you
guys have a great day and I will see you
in my next video which will be on Sunday
happy and camper is eating my shoes so
I'm gonna go grab that from him but I
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
