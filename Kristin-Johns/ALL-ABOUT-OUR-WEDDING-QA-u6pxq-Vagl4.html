video video because we have really
talked and all about the wedding I mean
it was only like two days ago but we
want make a video we have some questions
to answer
we asked you guys ask us some questions
on Twitter using the hashtag just maybe
dealain I think we just jump into it
what do you think I agree first question
will there be a wedding video
yeah I'll answer it yes there's going to
be a wedding video um we have some
amazing people do our wedding video
white and reverie is the name of our
company computer toaster p.m. we'll keep
you posted okay
someone said did you cry I cry probably
five times on the wedding day because
first of all I finished writing my vows
because we do his personal vows I finish
drying them the day of the wedding and I
was crying I don't know I've been so
emotional I was so excited like all the
build-up was like for this moment so
everyone keep asking me markets like are
you nervous what's going on how do you
feel I could feel good you don't feel
nervous and think it'll probably still
hit me when it happens and like two
minutes before I walked out onto the at
the stage but kind of like the area
where I was waiting for Christian as we
were he had the altar right before I
walked out there I just had like a big
burst of like oh I tried like good and
then I walked out there I teared a
little bit when Kristen came out and
then I don't think I really like cries
that much I was pretty good and the only
other time that I cried was when my mom
and I had her first dance and she
started crying she made me cry so those
were three times that I cried during
stairway and I cried by myself once how
does market tear his pants kind of it
find out that it's working I think one
snapchatted it
this is some song that was like alright
guys akimbo you can go I suppose it's
getting lower and lower and lower and I
just dropped it one time and I just it
wasn't like a and it's the only thing I
just felt with pants all of a sudden
skits loser is like yeah it like felt
good like it
oh they fit dinner oh no they said
better and I get a wind check and it was
just done what was your guys's first
dance song we danced to Jim Unitas true
and I really love yeah it's a really
good song you should look at us and it
was really sweet are you moving in
together
no we're living separately she's going
to live yeah we're moving in together
removing it together in the LA we're
going to be moving after the honeymoon
and I think we're going back to Florida
for a little bit give you guys DIY any
of the decor yes IDI wide so much stuff
and I think that's what took so long
but I think that's a little faster what
gives it like the personal touch you
know so I definitely wanted to be that
how does she said me and my dad di weds
a couple things yeah she wanted like
these logs for just decoration from me
my dad like there's an old rotting tree
we pulled it down just chainsaw it up
yeah yeah oh my dad built the cross for
us what was the most surreal moment of
the whole experience remember I'm
looking okay for me it was the whole
experience of just all my friends and
family from all different parts of was
like I have friends in LA we've never
met even my own family but everyone
joining as one I thought those the
craziest cool thing in Kristin's whole
family and it just felt like everyone
knew and loved each other at that
wedding you know yeah it was so cool
because my family and Marcia's family
haven't necessarily spent like a ton of
time together but it just felt like when
everyone was together we were to such a
huge family probably for me the most
surreal moment was when like they asked
as in you that we have
he is huge with wooden doors and they
closed them right before I walked out
and then they open them up and then I'm
standing there my dad about to walk down
the aisle and then I just saw like all
our family and friends sitting in all
the chairs and I saw Marcus and he was
crying all my bridesmaids and all the
groomsmen I was like this is the moment
it didn't feel like real life it really
felt like a dream like a little piece of
like heaven on earth there something
yeah it was very very special where's
your honeymoon going to be Fiji and New
Zealand we're going to eat for five days
and then New Zealand for ten days
someone said when are you getting a
golden retriever that's such a someone
when you discuss when are we going to
give it up probably we're going to wait
a few months because just to settle on
out and be able to fix up some spending
time with each other and I mean sin
probably like we're not going to wait
like five years to get it on but just
work through your truth no you consider
in your wedding could be the best day in
your life so far
yes a diesel engine apology rejected of
my life to have kids yeah it was the
most magical day I can't even explain it
ever since their wedding day is the best
day of their life and I'm always like
okay like you just can't really relate
because you've never had a wedding day
before and so once I have like this
really is the best and it's like you
never wanted to end it so special what
is the most stressful part about the
actual wedding day the most stressful
thing up until the wedding was that it
said on a weather app that it was like a
baby Christian chance of thunderstorms
all day on Saturday which was the day we
got married and I was freaking out
I was like our whole wedding without
side so there was like nothing that we
would have been able to do at this point
and so another thing too is we had a
certain amount of time to decide if we
want a tent or not and we're like yeah
we don't need a tent then also the
weather changed it was like 80% chance
of rain
and there was no way for us to get a
tent anymore because likely to ask you
and so I was freaking out I remember we
were driving to the venue and looking at
the weather app and still an 80% chance
at four o'clock in Times blog at six
o'clock and the rest the day I was like
oh my gosh and I felt in my heart I was
getting so much anxiety and I was like
okay I see you pray so I created I said
Jesus please please don't let it rain
today please please if you like if you
just grant one of my prayer says please
just don't let it rain and I remember
having this overwhelming sense of peace
and Jesus just calling my heart and
saying don't worry about the rain
anymore I got it and I said okay I'm not
going to worry about it anymore and I
didn't think about the rest of the day
and it didn't rain gave up started
drizzling okay morphling
and then it was fun and actually it
ended up being better that it was a
little bit overcast because it cooled
down everything because it was really
hot the day before and during the
rehearsal so it actually couldn't have
been better
yeah like the Sun was still I was still
really really pretty blue skies but it
was like just Shady and I okay someone
asked where did we get married we got
married at a place in Toronto Florida
called bramble cheesecake and it's kind
of like a little farm house not really a
farm house but it's like a big white
house and then we had the ceremony and
reception all outside and it's very
beautiful a ton of red market lighting
and it's very magical what are you most
excited for I'm really take for
honeymoon but I'm really excited to like
build like a house like make a house you
know move into a house whatever we do
just make like a life and kind of
decorate a house in that little yard and
kind of start in regular life you know
yeah because me and Marcus has been
living apart for me those are our entire
relationship so it'll just be so nice to
just have dog attic however cars go to
the same grocery store everyday now
we're not a Viking yeah not live out of
like a suitcase
anytime Kristen visits me she's living
out of the suitcase anytime I'm visiting
her so it's like we always feel a bit
out of place it's going to be nice for
us to share a room share a house share
you know everything happened act not
without a suitcase so that was our last
question but I did it well my guys know
