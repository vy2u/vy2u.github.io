not in Hawaii I'm actually home in
Tallahassee we got back a few days ago
but I'm posting this vlog today and
before I posted it I just wanted to say
a few things I just wanted to say thank
you so much to Disney for sponsoring
this video and allowing us this amazing
opportunity to go see the screening of
Moana and Hawaii it was an incredible
experience and I'm just so thankful and
also I just want to say thank you to
Disney's Aulani hotel for letting us
stay there and it's a Hawaiian Airlines
for our flights this whole trip was such
a blessing I feel like I had such a good
first Hawaiian experience so I'm so
excited for you guys to see the vlog and
I also posted some cute pictures from
Hawaii on my Instagram so I'll leave my
little Instagram thing right here so if
you guys want to go check those out and
here is the log morning everyone it's
officially day one in Hawaii we are on
Oahu a ton of you guys we're asking what
island we're going to we are on Oahu
right now and then we're going to the
Big Island in a few days it's so
beautiful here I'm so excited for today
I already have my swimsuit on I think
that today is just going to be pretty
chill hanging out by the beach it's like
actually paradise here I've never
experienced anything like it
there's just palm trees and the beach is
right over there
so I'm in heaven I apps it changed a
little bit I put on my way that they
gave us yesterday we got to the hotel
we're headed to the beach we just had a
delicious breakfast
it's so sunny outside and there's also a
slide that Marcus has I am blue but I
have my eye on that that Beach snap let
me feel that a beach now I think I'm
just going for that slaughter right away
one last thing will not laughs but
Marcus has been to Hawaii before I have
we did a shot of hey USA here in Oahu
right in a wahoo so he's kind of showing
me the ropes well I haven't been to this
side of the island and this is more of a
resort uh-huh and I don't really know
the island well but maybe we'll meet up
with a friend who knows the island well
yeah I want to go like climb a bulky I
think that's gonna happen really I think
it's supposed to happen
I love the itinerary we haven't had much
to update you guys on we've just been
chilling also very sunny so I put on my
sunglasses but it's just so relaxed long
and I keep telling you guys how pretty
it is here but I'm gonna actually show
you because that would be that'd be
nicer so here is the beach it's so
beautiful so perfectly sunny
it really is paradise I feel like that's
the really the only way I can describe
it one thing that I thought about Hawaii
was that the water is warm but that's
not true the water is actually very cold
right now we're doing
Marcus did his cartwheel and then show
everyone okay let's see it go for it hey
that wasn't so bad actually
yeah they're pretty good do it
Wow by the way guys I figured out right
when we Marcus get married I'm getting a
red gold or super I've done that for
everybody today I realized what I'm
gonna name him will it be I'm not naming
a dog until I see it that's the role
we're gonna name him Willie name has to
do with how it looks we're gonna call
him not true we're gonna call him willow
we're either gonna call him willow or be
so cute right I'm just getting ready for
tonight because tonight is the Moana
screening I do not know what I'm doing
with my hair because I didn't have time
to shower and it's just like beachy and
gross so I don't know what I'm doing
with my hair but I'm wearing this super
Hawaiian outfit which you guys have seen
in my first Lulu's haul I showed you
guys this dress it's so perfect for
tonight so why and I'm wearing a red
lipstick to match the dress and yeah I'm
so excited today was so much fun we just
chilled on the beach we played some
games and tomorrow we are going to the
Big Island and so we're flying there in
the morning and yeah I just wanted to
update you guys on what's going on
Polaroid's around your favorite thing

keep asking about it but we're gonna
take about Polaroids right now yeah
Oh blink look at it it's so fun I wish
every camera was a Polaroid

outfit of the day or the night guys

criticized when I initially bought it
but now she loves it
booyah where'd you get this I got this
from the hotel and you got some shorts
and where'd you your shoes those were
yours
I bought em them so here's the polaroid
almost developed I like it I think it's
cutie since I'm wearing a liquid
lipstick watch what happens when I kiss
Marcus is cheap no no transfer look look
no chance for my favorite we just got
out of the movie
so good all my lipstick is on site
this almost died because I almost fell
down these stairs but I was saying that
the movie was
then I love it
highly recommend it very good I love
that so many times in this blog like
just trying to get in the frame I guess
and that's why I do that well they gave

from the movie it's so cute again my
favorite character
my two favorite characters actually
officially day three in Hawaii I feel
like I didn't really vlog that much
yesterday because mainly we were just
traveling a lot and we left the Aulani
hotel which was such an insanely
beautiful hotel I definitely recommend
it if you guys are going to a walk but
now look at this view
beautiful we're on the Big Island I'm
with tiny and we're going to look for
breakfast Kristen is about to sneak
around Bhutan she's never had I love
your hair like the
really
I think I might have had one before yeah
so good we've had these before and you
said this is their favorite group when
you tried it like a wall coming up
that's what it was
so it's my favorite fruit
yeah I can eat a thousand of these
little present like Christmas you're
opening your little fruit Marcus just
left to go to the bathroom so I figured
now it's a perfect time to show you guys
my outfit because I found this little
mirror and this dress is a dress that I
have no idea where it's from because um
it's actually my friends dress so he and
I am actually wearing a one-piece today
I never wear one pieces but this one is
so cute it's from Urban Outfitters
and the back is the cutest part let me
see if I can show it can you see I can't
tell if you can see but I'll show you
guys later if you can't see and that why
we're so excited because we're going to
the black sand beach right now and never
been to a black sand beach I really
didn't know that existed finally got the
beach look how beautiful this is
it's so cool it's like lava rock well I
think that's definitely what it is but
it's so cool Wow this crab right here
that is a crap wait I didn't know that
right there dr. crab and he's so
spending he's literally really adapted
fun oh where is he oh there it is we're
at a lookout Oh
I really want to go on the heat this is
a beautiful place in Hawaii with a nice
black beach
today is our last day in Hawaii and I'm
so sad but this trip has been so much
fun so I'm so happy that we got to come
um but last night I was thinking about
it because Marcus is going to LA and I
have to go back to Tallahassee for
school and I realized that this is going
to be the last goodbye that is like a
long-distance goodbye for me and Marcus
because then I graduate in December and
he's coming for my graduation and then
we're getting married so it's really our
last time that we have to say goodbye
for like a month so I'm so happy about
that that's like a huge huge thing like
we've been doing long-distance for over
two and a half years so I just can't
believe that it's really coming to the
end I'm so happy I just can't believe it
but I wanted to come on here and show
you guys something that I discovered
that is so amazing I've been telling
every single person about it and I found
this nail polish it's by Essie and it's
the ones in their new bottles it's their
new gel formulation and I just bought
these at Walgreens because I needed to
paint my nails before Hawaii so I've had
this nail polish on for over a week
which is insane because I did it myself
and usually when I paint my nails myself
they chip within like the first two days
and they're all still on perfectly like
no chips I cannot believe it so I am
seriously gonna go buy like every single
color of this because it's like a
miracle
so I got the shade take me to thread and
it's just this really pretty like gray
purple mauve color and then I also got
the topcoat which i think is like really
important for it to stay on as long as
it camp just realized I have a rip in my
shirt a very bad one
look at that I know I look like so weird
trip is finally over
we're so sad we have a red-eye flight
nice a little waking up on LA but we
actually got put on a bow on a plane
with the planes with the characters
there's only three in the world we just
happened to be on one of them there's a
chocolate yeah but so we're going to try
to get some sleep man I hope you guys
enjoyed this vlog and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
