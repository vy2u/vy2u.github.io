about this video I'm not gonna lie today
I'm gonna be telling you guys high-end
products that are worth it to me and not
necessarily worth it to me
I just want to disclaim a little bit
that none of these products are horrible
sucky products but they're just products
that I don't think I'm gonna be
repurchasing and they're products that I
bought with my own money that I'm just
like maybe I wish I didn't spend my
money on that so hopefully that clears
things up a little bit but I think the
way I'm gonna go about this is going
from like a product that's worth it to a
product that's not worth it worth it not
worth it to mix it up a little bit you
know what I'm saying
and if any of you guys are new to my
channel make sure to subscribe and even
if you're a longtime viewer I know a lot
of you say sometimes you forget to
subscribe so don't forget to subscribe
but ok let's just get started with this
video that I'm a little bit nervous
about so I'm going to start with the
product that kind of inspired this
entire video and this is the lemare the
soft fluid long-wear foundation I'm
pretty sure this foundation is around a
hundred and ten dollars it's something
insane like that I actually just
recently got this at the Sephora vib
sale and it was definitely a product I
was very hesitant to buy just because it
is so expensive this foundation is kind
of like everything I've ever wanted it
in a foundation it looks super natural
on your skin it lasts all day it just
blends so easily like you put this on
your brush and blend it out and it's
like it's like the foundation is working
for you it's so weird this was kind of
the thing that made me say this is so
expensive but it really is worth it if
you're looking for a really expensive
really good foundation and now I'm going
to move on to a foundation that is very
expensive that I don't think is worth
the price and this is the Dior skin
err flash spray foundation I actually
use this in a video I think like a year
ago
I really haven't used it very much since
because this product just doesn't really
work on my skin very well it looks good
when I first apply it but I feel like
throughout the day
kind of starts looking like it's sitting
on top of my skin and I also don't
really like the way it like sprays out
it kind of just like makes the whole
makeup process a little bit more
stressful than a regular pump foundation
and I know this is so many people's like
all-time favorite foundations so I'm not
saying this is a horrible foundation at
all I'm just saying for my skin it
didn't really look very good for some
reason okay moving on to another face
product this is the Marc Jacobs dewdrops
I just talked about this in my November
favorites I love this stuff and I'm
definitely gonna be repurchasing when I
run out of this I feel like sorry I'm
stuck in my lipstick but this is like a
unique formula it's almost like a gel
I'm wearing it today on top of the
lemare foundation and it just looks so
pretty but just everything about the
process of using this is just like it's
like a delight even like the packaging I
have this sitting on my vanity because
it's so pretty and I love that it comes
in a pump it feels like a very sturdy
product okay
another product that's not worth its
price tag is the girl on war primer and
I got this about a year ago and you can
see I haven't used very much of this and
the first few times that I use this I
actually really liked it because it is a
good primer like it does hydrate your
skin and makes your skin look glowy I
guess it just really mainly I feel like
is like a moisturizing gel but I think
the main like selling point of this
primer is how firming it is and I think
that the reason it's not worth it to me
is because I'm still young I don't
really have wrinkles yet and so I don't
need firming things very much so I feel
like this is just not the product for me
it was so expensive it's very beautiful
like it has gold flakes in it so yeah
this one is not gonna be repurchased and
this next product is from hourglass this
is worth it to me and this is the
hourglass ambient palette it comes in
like the marble case but I don't know if
this one was limited edition or not but
basically I mainly want to talk about
the ambient blushes you can find a
ambient lighting blush palette or just
like try one of their blushes I really
think that they're worth it here's what
I think I think that when you put the
blushes on your cheeks they just look so
natural but also they give your skin a
glow but they also blur your skin so
just okay so my next not worth it item
is kind of more of a category and I just
don't think that expensive mascaras are
worth the price this is my reasoning
these are all really good mascaras the
Too Faced better than sex the Tarte
lifted the Urban Decay perversion I like
all of these mascaras but mascaras are
something that dry out within like two
to three months and at least for me I
use a ton of mascara so they dry out so
fast and I love the L'Oreal lash
paradise mascara it's my all-time
favorite and if I can get something at
the drugstore for six dollars that's why
I don't feel like high-end mascaras are
worth it my favorite one if I had to
tell you my favorite high-end mascara is
the Too Faced better than sex but I feel
like the L'Oreal lash paradise is an
exact dupe for it
so I'm gonna put my next to worth it
products together because they're both
lipsticks but this is the Charlotte
Tilbury lipstick in Miss Kensington and
the Pat McGrath lipstick in 1995 this
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick was actually
sent to me but I bought this one the Pat
McGrath one at the Sephora vib sale and
I think that both of these brands of
high-end lipstick are my favorite that
I've ever tried first of all both of
their packaging is beautiful this just
feels like like this is like a present
like every time I use this I feel like
so luxurious and I just love the
experience of using this lipstick and
also this would Charlotte Tilbury has
like some of my favorite packaging of
any one love the formula of them I love
the color selection that they have and
the Pat McGrath one though I think is a
little bit better than the Charlotte
Tilbury I mean it's
much more expensive but these lipsticks
like if you can see the way they glide
on is just there's just something
magical about them she puts something in
these lipsticks that is just amazing I'm
wiping my lipstick on my pyjama pants
right now okay this next product I'm a
little bit nervous to talk about because
I know every single person in the beauty
community loves this product and I like
to see myself in this little community
as kind of like your girl next door just
like your friend doing makeup with you
I'm not some professional makeup artist
I'm just you know a regular girl doing
her makeup on the video camera that's
why I wanted to share with you that if
you've really been thinking about
getting this palette I personally don't
think that it is worth the money it's so
expensive okay so this is the Natasha de
Nona sunset palette I would have never
even dreamed about purchasing this
palette because it's so ridiculously
expensive I think this is a hundred and
thirty dollars I bought this during this
for a vib sale and when I checked out I
was just like oh like why did I just do
that but I heard that Natasha didn't own
a shadows were amazing and I've heard
nothing but amazing things about this
palette first of all I know everyone
says this but this little wooden floppy
flipper is just so annoying but it's
okay I can look past that and the
shadows themselves look amazing like
these shadows are beautiful these are
like the colors that I love and I'm not
gonna say that the shadows are bad
quality but the shimmer ones like these
three that are like the most
eye-catching ones are so flaky like let
me just show you come on camera help me
out here okay see this shadow I'm gonna
swatch it you see how flaky that is like
I don't know if you can tell basically
they're just very flaky they're not like
smooth and easy to use the ones that are
more of like a finely milled shimmer are
easier to use and the mats are beautiful
so I mean that's something good about it
and the colors are beautiful but I feel
like
you're gonna sell an eyeshadow palette
for $130 like the main Beauty shimmer
ones need to be like on point and I feel
like these are just too tricky to use so
that's all the products that I had to
share with you guys today I really hope
that this was helpful I'm feeling less
guilty than I thought I would feel as
you're filming this which is a good
thing so if you like this type of video
