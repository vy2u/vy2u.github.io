be filming a video together and we
actually thought of this idea um a few
months ago we were trying to close our
eyes and type out a text and it just
turned out being so funny so we decided
to turn it into a video so I think we're
going to call it like the blindfolded
texting challenge alright so here's
what's gonna happen I'm gonna get my
phone and I'm gonna blindfold my eyes
and Kristen is going to tell me the
message that I'm supposed to send so if
we were to gamify this I guess I would
say if I get a text perfect I get a
point and if I don't and it's just funny
and I don't get a point the funny thing
about this video is it's amazing how a
weird auto text or autocorrect can be
like the autocorrect cansada weirdest
thing makes the text just really funny
who am i sending the first text okay the
first text to your bridge why should I
get to choose her nope choose everything
