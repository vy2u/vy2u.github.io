Marcus and we are going to play a game
that I thought of when it me and him
we're playing catch with one of my
makeups fun tourism so here yeah we were
playing catch with this and I was like
Marcus how much do you think that this
is and and I was like wait that's a good
idea for video so in this video I have a
bunch of different like girly makeup
products and beauty products stuff like
that and I have all the prices right
here wait a minute based on the first
stage so Marcus is gonna guess how much
he thinks each of them are because I
think guys sometimes underestimate how
much Beauty really costs like beauty
products should I give you should I give
you the the price that I think it should
be or omission I can either press I
think the price you think it okay
alright of horizontally or vertically I
guess horizontally that's what I did
okay so the first thing I have is this
and it's the Too Faced it has a hair on
it the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation now you can hold it feel how
it feels in your hand
does it seem nice okay that seems nice
so I would say this is you know a decent
build quality there's some nice plastic
there's a you know it seems like that's
like a nice little glass you know
there's a nice glass bottom this is my
final answer
yeah this is the real price of it 39
bucks I was over yeah
crap I'm already going way over how long
is that gonna last me that lasts me like
half a year for 40 bucks to have like a
nice space yeah I feel like that wasn't
that bad actually is that crazy yeah is
that an expensive stuff yeah it's like
the more higher-end brain okay if I'm
off by $500 in any direction
I failed yeah okay okay so if I'm off by
$500 in any direction if I go over or
under and it's adds up to 500 I'm lost
okay alright
is the next thing okay hold it oh you
even told me and I already forgot this
is what started it all playing catch
with the trending um I'm gonna say this
is a clean it should be $5 I feel like
it's gonna be five bucks okay Tony
twenty bucks
can you believe that that sponge is
worth twenty dollars right yeah that's
pretty bad okay the next one is this and
I'm just asking you what one of these
little eyeshadows is from that this is
all I shadow this whole thing is an eye
shadow right here yeah it's prolly sure
how long so you use more than others
yeah you haven't used that one at all so
to me that's worth $1 they're all work
same price point five ounces it
shouldn't cost this much but this is
what it costs I think six bucks I was
off okay this is the next thing
morph morphe is it more few more I
remember you said that
these are an expensive brush I remember
so you listened what that's right hmm
but pretty soft pretty substantial and
you're sure yeah yeah this is a solid
brush laughs what is that stain 1990
jeez I'm going over on everything I know
I
Wow I shall under going under you're
gonna go under
well I just know that everything's so
expensive that you get but I'm circling
under now dang so this is the next thing
okay it's the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer how much do you think
that were what is this for it's
concealer wears concealer it's like
other guys yeah clean matte look okay I
was very close that's pretty good yeah
all right so it's only off by speaking
dollar that's a very good there's no way
I'm gonna be off by $500 that's pretty
good you know what I'm gonna go for I
don't want to be off by more than $130
okay this isn't it I know the price of
this cuz you
- because you told me is it this
my on this little bottle yeah I remember
it was like stupid expensive are you
kidding
I thought that was like so chance how
much the big version of this is oh I
think I'm not really sure but this is
the Josie Maran Argan rack I was off
like Steve Allen $44 sorry I really went
over okay this the colour-pop liquid
lipstick and if you watched my video on
colour-pop lipstick then you wouldn't
know how much it is yeah I skill key I
skip a little bit you know I mean you
know this that's plastic with a you know
little thing on the outside I feel like
this didn't cost that much to make I
don't think that they should be selling
it for that much if they are they're
making a lot of money off of it so I'm
gonna go with the clean this month yes
I'm killing it now I'm getting yeah okay
job okay this next one isn't makeup its
nail polish nail polish you know I'm
gonna go with the clean your red nails
it seems what don't okay I feel like
there's so many different nail polishes
this is gonna last you a long time
that's a cute ball because I do thanks
okay yeah I think it's pretty cute feel
like nail polish is just it stays on
longer it's like a it's like a harsh
material maybe it's move eight okay I
was a little bit next thing
this is the hourglass ambient lighting
bronze earth why is it so sparkly
study well Oh God
I think it's nice I think it feels nice
there's a nice click it's like I know
it's close yeah I think that I'm looking
at the case I'm like you know this
problem was a good amount of manufacture
so I'm gonna do a clean knowledge Wow
can you believe that for a bronzer why
is that so expensive it's just a really
like high quality brand I guess okay
next one are these blushes by Tarte and
I got a few to show you and are we going
with an individual properties are my
favorite price oh these are my favorite
umm blushes so I know it's going to be
cheap no it's your favorite price which
is cheap no no I didn't mean hate that
flush so this is stuff you put on your
cheeks right yeah how many things do you
need for some this one has not been
touched it I use this every single bit
you can still see that head out you can
still see the pattern on it you know $10
off $28 shoot okay this is the next one
this is a duo lash glue and you use this
to put on your fake eyelashes right for
clothes like a buck at the dollar store
maybe five bucks for like the higher end
I see I know I know it's something like
that though but it's gonna be like you
know the human tested and like nice and
safe so it's going to be more sensitive
so let's say it's double the price of
superglue now triple the price eighteen
eighteen $45 shoot that's that's pretty
cheap I was surprised I thought it was
more but then I look at them
on line $35 this the anastacio glow kit

is this for again your eyes
