and we just got back a few days ago from
a little vacation with Marcus's family
we went to Lake Tahoe and we brought the
dogs and it was such a relaxing weekend
and I'm sure some of you guys saw on my
Instagram story but since we were gone
for a little bit I do need to catch up
on some work things so I'm gonna hop on
a call with my manager really quick so
we can kind of like plan out certain
things that we need to plan out for work
but really quick before the day starts I
want to show you guys my dress cuz I
just got it from ASOS and it's so cute
this is what it looks like it's just a
little flowy white blue babydoll dress
and it has little ruffle sleeves but I
just thought that was really cute and
they probably still have it since I did
just get it like two days ago
Wow I feel so much better when things
are planned out because when I just have
a ton of stuff and I'm just like
thinking about all the things I have to
do it's just like my brain gets so
overwhelmed but then once I like
organize it write it all down
talk about it with my people I feel so
much better inside oh my gosh this is
what I wanted to show you guys I wanted
to show you the most exciting new
addition to our house look at this we
got a dining table we haven't had a
dining room table ever in this house and
it just took us so long to find one that
we really loved and we finally got this
one at like this little market in LA and
we got it for such a good price the guy
handmade it and he was so nice
we weren't even expecting to find one so
I'm so happy about this are you happy
about that are you happy about that yes
good girl I also wanted to show you guys
that when I got back from Lake Tahoe all
of my plants just like thrived while I
was gone and they grew so much I was
like what the heck but look I got this
brand new leaf on my fiddle tree and
also these three are new and this one is
also growing a brand new leaf like a
really big one so very happy about that
also this one is growing a brand new
leaf and I just kind of finished
decorating this little shelf we have and
look I don't think I've ever shown y'all
this but I have this little frame of
pull open of Polaroids of candor when he
was a puppy look how small he was today
has been a weird vlogging babe
cuz I've logged a little bit in the
morning and never again but we were
working all day and I took a nap for two
hours yeah he took in that for two hours
on me so basically I was like we'll have
to stay here cuz him and honey we're
sleeping on me but now we're going to
get dinner and we're going to our
favorite restaurant well our favorite
sushi restaurant I should say it's like
very minimalist sushi like it's just
what's it called when it's raw
sashimi it's like all sheesh
as you can probably tell it is the next
day and let me turn on the radio real
quick I fell asleep last night while I
was editing a video and I didn't get to
finish the vlog so I was like you know
what I'm just gonna vlog today as well
make the full sandwich vlog as we call
it once I gotta have stop boy I'm
driving okay I'm at a red light so I can
continue blogging but it's a beautiful
day here and me and Lexie and Shelby
Marx's sister are going to Santa Monica
today and we're gonna do some shopping
actually a little bit chilly at 60
degrees so I got to put on my little
leather jacket which I always love when
I can wear my leather jacket because it
just makes you feel a little bit cooler
than you really are you know don't say
we're in brandy Melville right now how
do we feel about this little shirt
don't get its really cropped though
I hate trying things on so I found these
very cute I think I'm gonna get them now
we're in Nordstrom and look at all the
flowered dresses I found okay this dress
is my dream dress it is one size too big
but oh it's so pretty awesome I'm
calling me this is just like happy and a
dress and it's so comfy I also found
this trench coat which is really
beautiful I've always wanted like a tan
long trench coat it's like business girl
spring party flower girl her other one
fell out
but you smells so good it smells so good
honey
come I'll show you what I got for Mom yo
yo yo she got it at the mall yo yo yo
the first thing I thought you would
really like I feel like that's the most
uncool thing you could possibly do is
say yo yo yo she got another ball yo yo
yo you struck out um the last thing I
got is this don't never know from
Anthropologie oh it's so bright
hey it's basil and peach smell that I
see you've come to the dark side
it smells like basil and peach what is
he really like now it's so fresh right
you're doing special you know but anyway
the shirt that I showed Marcus this one
this pink one is from Topshop is the
second thing this um peach basil candle
from Anthropologie it's tiny and it was
16 dollars but when I smelled it it just
the smell of basil it's just so good to
me so uh I got that I also got two
things from brandy melville show you
guys real quick
I might have shown you these in the
dressing room but I can't remember so I
got this little striped top I really
like the color of this I like how it's
brown and red and black I don't know why
just don't see that color combo that
often fake hair it's just so horribly
crazy right now but I also got these
little sweatpants from brandy melville
and they're grey and light blue stripes
and they cinch at the bottom and these
just felt so soft and I didn't even try
these on but hopefully they fit and I
got one other thing from Anthropologie
look how cute this is
let me show you up close a little bit
better look how cute this is um but I
saw this in the store and I was like
that's probably like $50 and then I
thought it was only $20 and it's just a
really cute pop for your plants so you
can also put a candle in this or like
some flowers but you know me I'm gonna
put plant in it and last place we went
was H&amp;amp;M and I found two sweaters and
they were having a huge sale on their
sweaters like everything was ten dollars
and they had the best sweaters so I got
two the first one is this white one and
again if I can find it online I will
definitely try to link it for you guys
but it's just this big white knit
turtleneck it's pretty long and slouchy
but I love turtlenecks so much so I'm so
this and the other one that I got is
purple like multicolored like has pink
purple blue yellow like all in it so it
looks kind of like and it looks cool I
love the style of turtleneck like when
the tournament just live goes up and it
doesn't fold over I really like that so
but now actually need to get dressed and
do something with my hair because we are
going to Marx's brother
Cody's show tonight and he's gonna be
performing and I'll probably fill up
some of that for you guys and then oh
yeah I just really need to go brush my
hair I couldn't really fix my hair so I
just put on a hat you know to cover a
pull situation well I'm wearing this
dress that is from Zara with a little
turtleneck underneath it and these
booties which are from ASOS we got it go
I just got home and I took a quick
shower and what the heck time is it it's
1:30 and the morning show was so fun and
today in general was just very relaxing
and I'm glad that I got to put two days
of the vlog into one keeping like always
I did want to share it like a Jesus
thing with you guys but I'm so tired I
can't really think straight right now
so I just want to share with you my
favorite worship song at the moment it's
called not in a hurry by will Reagan and
United pursuit and it is so good guys
and I just encourage all of you guys to
go listen to that song because it's just
beautiful
and just just so amazing and I think it
will speak to a lot of you guys so I
just I've been listening to that song
and repeat like every day all day all
day every day
but if you did like this video please
