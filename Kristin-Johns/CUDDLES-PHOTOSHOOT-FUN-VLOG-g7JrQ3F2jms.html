on mike has never wears makeup but we
are doing a photo shoot today so we're
downtown and I thought I would be fun to
vlog because you can get some footage of
it and then who knows what we're doing
the rest of the day
we just finished with the photo shoot it
was so fun
it was that was my it's time to vlog
chase I'm not gonna lie it was the best
photo shoot I've ever done because I
hate photo shoots and also I hate this
Lighting's we've never been here but we
do love Mendocino farms need they're
like once a week we just decided to try
it it's actually been two days since I
was just logging but I'm actually doing
a livestream on Instagram right now
maybe one of you guys is in this
Instagram live right now wow that's
really crazy
so everyone say hi to the vlog you will
all be in my vlog le Katie Chelsea by
the way I love doing Instagram lives so
come join me one day ok say bye to the
vlog everybody bye ok it's like two
minutes later I just had to change my
shirt because I realized that two days
ago when I was vlogging I was wearing
that shirt and then yesterday since I
didn't vlog because I film another video
I was wearing that same shirt and then
today I was wearing that shirt again so
I was like you could change my shirt so
I just changed my shirt this one is from
Zara the reason that I did not vlog
yesterday was because I filmed a whole
nother video and I was just working all
day and it would not have been a fun
vlog to watch and then after the photo
shoot I was gonna continue vlogging but
I got the worst period cramps I've ever
had my entire life and I pretty much
laid in bed from 4 o'clock til when I
went to sleep at night so I'm really
sorry about that so I'm just gonna make
this a sandwich vlog which is basically
where I'm gonna sandwich two days in
together what else am i doing today
today I am about to go film a video with
Marcus a video about yard boys which is
his trained dog trained doggy his train
hopping documentary I'm gonna answer how
I felt about it so that'll be a fun
video finish filming for Marcus's
channel and now I want to surprise him
with some of his favorite lemonade I've
talked about this lemonade that I make
before but I'm going to
you guys how I make it this is honey
lemonade and it is amazing so all you
need to make it are some lemons I have
two bags of women ready and needle a lot
of honey like a lot of money so I'm
gonna use probably not this whole bottle
but this like a lot of this okay so the
first thing you do is you bring six cups
of water to a boil and then you're gonna
squeeze one cup of lemon juice so I'm
just gonna cut a bunch of lemons in half
and just start squeezing wow I had the
exact amount of lemons the exact amount
of lemon juice so now I'm just gonna
dump my honey into my water it's not
boiling anymore I took it off the heat
and then you add the honey the most
important part is your lemon juice and
mix that all so this is how much
lemonade it makes it actually makes a
really large amount of lemonade but this
will probably last in our house for one
to two days cuz Marcus drinks so much of
it but I wanted to share that little
recipe with you guys because Marcus is
obsessed with us he says it's the best
lemonade he's ever had if you guys try
it let me know if you like it so I'm
just gonna put this in the fridge now
Marcus explain to me what the heck babe
what is that Shh this is the type of
male he gets these are the things he
orders I just got a new CB radio and I
tried my very not be broken little miss
Trina
oh yeah hey Marcus has been getting
packages and coming to the house he's
jealous because now I'm getting as many
packages as her cuz I went on a rampage
where did you go on a rampage within
them yeah every day he's been getting
like six packages yep they're like nine
dollars things for like all the things
like this like microphones bolts it
screw it's for the Geo Tracker can we go
get barbecue I always end up back here
day after day so we're back at the house
now we took a little pit stop at the
plant store and I did get a few new
plants I'll just show you them really
quick look at this tiny cactus I mean I
couldn't pass him up okay I just turned
a little light on so maybe you can see
me better but basically on Instagram
look at this tiny bean basically on
Instagram my name has been Kristin
Lauria forever because that is my maid
but all of my other social medias
besides snapchat are Kristen John's so I
really wanted to change my Instagram -
Kristen John's just to make it easier
for everybody and I just wanted my
actual last name to be my last name on
Instagram so I have been trying to get
my name changed for eight months
basically a girl already had my name
actually was like a lady like four year
old lady she already had Kristen John's
basically an entire exchange happened
between us for about eight months like
me trying to get ahold of her emailing
back and forth trying to figure out
something like a way to make both of us
happy and finally she let me have that
finally she let me have to use her name
Kristen John's
and I am just so happy guys I think I'm
so happy because I know I've been
working on trying to get so now you guys
can find me on instagram at Kristen
John's you can also follow honey at
camper and honey if you want to follow
them because they have their Instagram
account is better than mine to be honest
but so that is something exciting that
happened I don't know I just feel
relieved like I don't ever have to worry
about this again because it's just been
such a long process this is what I do
five minutes before I have to leave to
go to the gym I play dress-up but look
how pretty this dress is it's from a
brand called rocky collie I think that's
how you pronounce it um but they kindly
sent this to me and it's like the most
beautiful dress ever
but now I need to put my gym clothes on
do you see how dark it is and it's only
six o'clock
I hate the time change so much but I'm
about to go into Pilates and I really
don't feel like going but I'm meeting
Lexi here she's like my workout buddy so
if I have someone to workout with I will
workout but if it's just me I will not
work out I mean I told you guys this was
a sandwich vlog so I didn't finish my
vlog from last night but right now I'm
gonna finish the vlog it's the next day
and I wanted to finish the vlog off with
not a devotion I I want to keep
continuing ending these vlogs with some
type of some type of encouragement for
you guys so oh no no no no no no do you
see this this is Charmin ultra this is
this the good stuff you cannot choose
this up oh my gosh okay I'm sorry
honey just was eating an entire roll of
toilet paper but I want to end you guys
off with a Bible verse that I have been
looking at for the past two weeks since
I actually put it on this letter board
basically it says I wait for the Lord my
whole being waits and in his word I put
my hope is Psalms 131st five and you
know how when you just fever so many
times or maybe you see a quote so many
times that it doesn't really sink in
what it means I feel like that's kind of
how it's been for me in that Bible verse
because I see it every single day a
million times a day because it's sitting
right on my dresser but then today I was
really thinking about it I just have a
lot of big bowls that I want to
accomplish in my life
and for my job and just for a bunch of
different things and then I started
getting kind of discouraged because I
was like these goals are just so big I
feel like it's going to take me forever
and I don't even know if like it'll be
successful and I was just kind of
getting discouraged and I was like I
don't even know how
make this happen so then once I read
that first day I was just like God's
timing is perfect
and whatever is going to happen will
happen in his perfect timing and it's so
true so many times in my life I have
wanted to rush things and I've wanted
things happen in my time in my schedule
and every time it doesn't happen I feel
annoyed in the moment but then God's
timing always pulls through and it's
just so true that you just need to wait
for the Lord like have your whole being
wait just like don't be impatient don't
get discouraged because his timing is
perfect so I just wanted to share that
little encouragement for you guys today
don't be impatient and just let things
work out the way they're gonna work out
because everything will work out in the
end the way that it's supposed to so I
love you guys so much I really hope that
you enjoyed this vlog this sandwich vlog
that is actually three days put into one
and if you do like these types of vlogs
maybe where I incorporate more days into
one vlog let me know if you did like

thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
