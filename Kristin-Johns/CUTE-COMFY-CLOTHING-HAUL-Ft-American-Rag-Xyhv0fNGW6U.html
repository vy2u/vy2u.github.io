you some clothes that I got from a brand
called American Rag and American Rag is
a brand you can find at Macy's and they
have some really really cute thing so I
have a few things to show you guys today
and like always I will be trying them on
and showing you how to pair some
different items with different outfits
I'm really excited because I've been
posting some pictures of these outfits
on my social medias and I've gotten a
ton of comments from you guys asking me
where I got them so I'm really excited
to show you them and it's not a huge
massive haul or anything like that but
it's just a few things that I thought
that you guys would like to see so the
first things that I'm going to show you
might just be my favorite thing that I
got because it is so cute and cozy so
the first thing is this little pajama
set it comes with this little hoodie um
little sweatshirt and these shorts so
it's a matching set and guys this is
just the cutest thing ever because I
never wear Kate pajamas I always wear
like a t-shirt and some shorts I never
like trying what to eat when I'm going
to sleep but this makes me feel very
cute
before going to sleep this has a little
tie at the bottom and the wrists are
kind of like cinched like this and then
I just love these shorts because they
fit perfectly they're a little bit I
wasted and they've got pocket and also I
love the material that this is made of
because it's not too heavy like it's not
a fleece material it's kind of just like
a cotton like very just soft and cozy
material it doesn't make you feel like
hot or like you're wearing too much
stuff because I hate being hot when I'm
going to sleep so I love this set I've
been wearing it so much the next thing I
got is also very cute and it's this
shirt this looks so cute with jeans or
shorts or a little skirt it just pairs
with anything and it has a really cute
little cutout design on the front and
then the back has this like little
strappy cutout maxwell's at the back of
it doesn't go too low so you can just
wear a strapless bra with it or a little
bra let in you can't see the back of it
which I appreciate will be tails like
that
so this is
really happy I'm not going to get a kind
of way out of this because it's just an
easy shirt but also looks unique and
special on so I really like this lemon
and I've been pairing this shirt with
these jeans I also got and these are
some of my favorite jeans right now
they're very very comfortable and they
look like this they're just kind of
light washed and they have some rips on
them and I have these really cute
bottoms that I love kind of like 70s I
don't know why I always think that
bottoms like this look like the 70s but
I've been wearing these your ton they're
very comfortable they're the perfect
links they don't have too much distress
I just feel like they have like the
perfect amount of ripped you know what
I'm saying sometimes they have too much
sometimes they have you little butt
beads I feel like a really good balance
of richness and the next thing that I
got are two dresses this is the first
one and this one looks like this it's
the softest dress it feels like like
softer than cotton like I don't even
know it's like a jersey material that's
what it is if your lectures Asian a
little sleeves have these little ruffles
which I love I think it just makes it
look so cute and it kind of has a higher
neckline a little pocket and it's just
very cute it's a very easy like little
skater dress that you can wear with
anything it's super comfy my favorite
type of clothing because you can just
throw it on with anything and I love the
stripes I love anything stripe so this
is the first dress I also got this dress
which is another kind of stripy skater
dress this one doesn't have as much of
the ruffle sleeves but it has a
different material this one kind of
feels more like linen or a little bit
more of a thicker material and I really
like the color of this because it's kind
of like a heather gray with like a
distressed black so I really like this
one and I'm going to get so much wear
out of both of these dresses just
because like I said they go with
anything and they just also look very
cute on so I love those two dresses and
the last thing that I got are these
pants I don't know what you call these
pants on
there's a proper name for them but I
don't know them they look like this they
have a little tie up there and then they
go all the way down and they're a little
bit more baggy in the mix in chat your
ankle and these are the coolest colored
pants I've never owned rust colored
pants but I love them and I've been
wearing them so much they have pockets
they have pockets down here and when I
first bought these I was kind of scared
that they wouldn't look very good on me
just because they're bad here and I
usually wear fitted pants but these look
very cute also I just like pairing these
with a little crop top and some brown
heels and they just look very nice so
that is it for this haul I really hope
you guys liked it on everything in this
haul I seriously have been wearing a ton
so I'm glad that I finally got to come
on here and show you guys what I got I
love you guys so much
I hope you have a great rest of your day
and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
