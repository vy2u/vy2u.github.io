first Christmas Eve video of the month
of December and I'm so excited and I'm
going to be showing you guys how i got
this makeup look and I was thinking when
I was doing this makeup it's more of a
nighttime Christmas party look but I'm
also going to be filming a more daytime
Christmasy look later on in the month oh
make sure that you watch out for that
one and I hope you guys like this video
I hope you like this makeup look and
let's just get started in the video hi
guys okay the first thing I did I
already primed my face and I used this
one by Tarte and I really love this one
because it really does smooth out all
your skin and makes your foundation
really easy to put on and then we're
actually going to move on to our eyes
since we're using a little bit of darker
colors today so we don't want to do our
concealer and everything and then it
just be ruined by the eyeshadow so I'm
gonna zoom in a little bit so the first
thing we're going to do is prime our
eyes for our eye shadow and I'm gonna be
using Mac Paint Pot in painterly and I
love this because it actually conceals
all of your eyelid veins and also it
makes your eyeshadow stay on all day and
it's really just the best so I really
recommend this and I'm just gonna put
that all over the top of my eyelid I'm
using this color from some morphe 35o
palette and I'm just gonna put that
right in the crease
try not to get that color on your lid
because that's gonna be where the
lightest shade is and so you want to
keep this part bright looking but just
focus it right above the crease now I'm
going to take a clean blending brush
this doesn't have anything on it and
it's a sigma tapered blending p40 and
i'm just gonna blend out the edges so
there's no noticeable lines okay now
that our creased shadow is blended out
I'm gonna take this black eyeliner and
perversion by urban decay and I'm just
going to put that on the outer corner of
the eye just as a base for the darker
color we're gonna put down and amyl them
and it doesn't have to be very neat you
can just kind of smudge it on in there
and I recommend a more smudgy eye pencil
if you have it because we're gonna be
blending this out and that will just
make it a lot easier so now that you
look a little wild we're just gonna take
a a blending brush and blend that out
and again this part doesn't have to be
perfect either because we're eventually
just gonna be putting eyeshadow over
this I'm gonna be using this pigment and
it's by Mac and it's called reflex
bronze and it's just a really pretty
sparkly golden bronze color and you can
really use any sparkly eyeshadow for
this part just whatever color you really
want and I'm going to be taking this on
a flat brush let's braid that with fix+
and I'm just gonna put the pigment on
the inner half of my eyelid
so now I'm going to be taking a dark
brown eyeshadow and I'm using this one
thing that on top of where I put the
black eyeliner now I'm going to take a
little bit more of the warm brown
eyeshadow that I used before and I'm
going to just run that through my crease
to blend everything out now I'm going to
be using the Josie Maran Argan
enlightenment the luminizing veil and
I'm just going to use this as my brow
bone highlight and now that we're mainly
done with the eye shadow I'm gonna go in
with concealer and I'm using the Naked
skin by urban decay concealer and just
putting that underneath my eyes and you
can even bring this down a little bit to
highlight underneath your eyes a little
bit more I'm gonna take a fluffy brush
and blend this all up and we're going to
smudge out the lower lash line a tiny
bit and I'm gonna be using that same
warm matte color that I have put in my
crease and I'm just gonna use a tiny
paper brush like this and just go and
now I'm going to do a winged eyeliner it
should look something like this so we're
just gonna move on to finishing the rest
of our face I'm going to be using the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation and
guys this is my new favorite thing in
the whole world because first of all it
comes in a really dang cute bottle with
a pump which is very helpful and also it
makes you look like you're not even
wearing any makeup
and this is by far my favorite
foundation I've ever used
I'll have all the products that I used
linked down below but I just want to
tell you guys I really really love this
so I'm gonna put a little bit of this on
a real techniques buffing brush
all you need is a little dot oh by the
way if you're wondering why the heck I
didn't do my mascara yet it's because I
always wait to do my mascara until after
I do my face powder and bronzer and all
that stuff
because I feel like it somehow gets in
my eyelashes and makes them look all
powdery so I'll be doing that very last
I'm gonna be setting my face with just a
regular powder brush it's time for the
bronzer I am using the Smashbox bronze
light little bronzer and I really like
this for her I am a little bit more pale
and I'm just gonna oh and I'm just going
to take it on a little a little brush
something like this
and just put that in happy hollows of my
cheeks
and I'm gonna put it on my forehead and
then I'm gonna take a fluffy brush and
blend that all out now for blush I'm
going to be using exposed bite art and
it's just a really nice neutral color
and I usually like doing neutral colors
for blush when I have more of a dramatic
eye look happening so this one is
perfect and now I'm just going to fill
in my eyebrows really quick I like to
focus the pattern more on the outer part
rather than the inner part because I
feel like that makes it look a little
bit more natural come along to the best
part and something that I think is
crucial for a Christmas party and that
is the highlight and I'm gonna be using
the best highlighter in the whole world
by Becca and it's Jacqueline Hills
highlighter in Champagne pop yeah it's
the best I'm gonna be putting that on
the tops of my cheeks and my nose a
little bit and also I'm gonna take a
little bit and put it on the inner
corner of my eyes just for some added
brightness so I just curl my eyelashes
and now I'm gonna use benefit roller
lash which I love
the very last part of this look would be
lips and I have three different options
and I'll show you them all on my lips so
the first one is this red one and this
is NARS Cruella lip pencil and so I'll
show you guys what that looks like so
this is what the red one looks like I
love this red lipstick it's definitely
one of my favorites and it's perfect and
so Christmassy so this is the first one
this is the second lip option and this
is max rebel and I really love this one
it's like a dark purple Lee berry color
and I think that it's also perfect
Christmastime and so that is that one oh
this is the third lip option and this is
Kat Von D's lolita liquid lipstick and
it's more of just a mommy neutral
brownish color but I really really like
it I think it's really nice with this
makeup look and so you guys should
comment below and say what your favorite
lip color with this look would be I
think I think mine might just be the
classic red I really love red lips with
this kind of makeup look okay guys that
is the end of the video I hope you guys
