you my first impressions and also lip
swatches of the different color pop
lipsticks that I ordered a few days ago
so I'll show you guys how those look on
and I'm also going to choose one to wear
throughout the day and I'll kind of just
like vlog the rest of my day and show
you guys how the lipstick holds up let's
just get started on the first color and
that one is Lumiere it's a matte lip II
stick in this color is a really pretty
everyday color it's a really nice like
mauve pink color it's really really
comfortable on your lips and it seems
like it's a texture that would last a
really long time it's not like too
slippery but it's not like too drying
either a second lippy stick I got is
called grunge and it's also a matte I
couldn't really tell online what color
this was but I was surprised that I
actually really like this color on it's
flattering for a brown shade and if I
ever feel brave enough this is probably
the Brown that I would reach for the
next color I got is a ultra satin lip
stick and it's in the shade little
stitch you as' and this is a very very
pale pink color I don't personally love
it but I think that if you did like nude
pink lipsticks then you would like it
the next shade I got is the color deeper
and this is an ultra matte lipstick and
this one is a little bit more um like
gray toned on your lips but it's still
like that nice neutral color that I feel
like a lot of people like the next shade
I have is an ultra satin lip stick and
it's in the shade Echo Park and this is
just a really pretty like Coralie nude
color and I love this one so much I
think that this is my favorite one out
of all of them which is really
unexpected because I don't usually go
for more like warm shades if you want a
liquid lipstick that isn't necessarily
super drying or super matte on your lips
then I would recommend the satin formula
the next shade is called tool and
this is an ultra matte lipstick and this
one is also really pretty it's more of a
deep rosy red color and it looks a lot
darker on your lips than it does in the
tube the next one I have is a satin
lipstick and this is in the shade Frick
and frack and this one is also one of my
favorites I just think it's like a
perfect neutral color for every day it's
a little bit more dark than I usually
wear but I still think it's super pretty
the next one I have is the shade bumble
and I love the name bumble I think it's
so cute and this one is definitely more
of a like red with really coral
undertones like it's a lot more warm
than the other one this next one is
avenue and it's an ultra matte lipstick
and it's just a perfect everyday red I
feel like you could wear this if you
have a prom or you have like any special
event coming up because it's just a
really flattering red color I just feel
like all you can really say is that it's
like the perfect red color but I will
warn you it does look darker on your
lips than it does in the bottle so if
you want kind of more of a brighter
lighter red I probably wouldn't go for a
next color I have is straight-up
Brown like brown and it's called limbo
and this color all I can really say is
that it's brown but it's actually way
more flattering than I thought it would
be this next one is called LAX and it is
an ultra matte lipstick and it's a super
super dark purpley red color just be
aware that like it's so mad that it
almost feels like you have like a powder
on your lips the last shade I have is
called root and it's an ultra matte
lipstick the only difference I can see
between this one and lax is that this
one has a little bit more red in it
instead of purple okay so today I'm
going to wear tulle and that is a matte
lipstick I chose this one because I feel
like it's dark enough so that you guys
can see how it's wearing but also I
won't look like a crazy person
running errands today okay guys tool is
now on my lips it's 2:05 in the
afternoon I am gonna go run some errands
really sorry my camera just died but I
was just saying that I'm gonna go run
some errands and my mom is coming later
tonight so I have to get some things
done before she gets here
but I will check back in with you guys
in a little bit hi which color do you
like do you like any of them oh you like
it hello it is now we don't really know
what time it is for 25 and I haven't
left the house yet and that's because
I've been cleaning up and also editing
my video so haven't really done anything
to make the lipstick change um it looks
like the same pretty dark it's way
darker and then I thought it was going
to be feel like this is more realistic
lighting than it was in my room but this
is how the lipstick looks before I eat
I've had it on for about two hours but
we're really gonna make it stand the
test cuz I'm gonna go get food there's a
bug somewhere in here okay I'm back with
another chicken I just ate lunch
/and dinner oh no I don't know what time
it is
5:48 so now it's been a while since I've
had this on but I just ate and now it's
definitely wearing off you can see it's
wearing off there and in the middle so
then I got this because I was going to
reapply it and it exploded all over my
hands which what the heck and you can
see how gloopy and like overflowing it
is I don't
why that happened because I didn't even
take it with me anywhere so that's weird
and hopefully that doesn't happen to all
of them but I'm going to reapply it and
see if you can reapply it or if they
like chunks up I hate the word chunks so
I'm really sorry about that one as you
can tell it didn't clump up or anything
when I reapplied it which is really good
but probably at this point throughout
the day I would just take it off because
I usually don't even wear lipstick this
dark throughout the whole day so it just
feels kind of annoying on my lips I'm
going to keep it on for the rest of the
night and I will do one more check in
with you guys and tell you my final
thoughts about this lipstick so I just
got done at the gym
it is like 8:30 now and I am so dang
tired of hashing this lipstick on but
it's still holding on like a true champ
probably wouldn't have picked this color
for just day-to-day because it is so
dark I guess I just didn't realize that
but overall I would give these lipsticks
a thumbs up because I really think that
they are super good I would just
recommend the satin formula if you hate
drying things because they are kind of
drying and after wearing them for a
really long time they might kind of like
dry out your lips so yeah that's pretty
much my whole review I hope that you
guys like this video if you did it
please give it a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and I
will see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
