everyday makeup routine and I actually
asked you guys on Twitter I did a little
Twitter poll for you guys and it was a
51% vote for an everyday makeup routine
and a 49% vote for in all drugstore
makeup looks so they were very close but
the everyday makeup routine won by only
a few percentage points so I'm going to
be showing you how I do that today and
if you want to see how I did it then
let's just get started okay so the first
thing that I do when I'm doing my
everyday makeup is prime my face and I
have been using the makeup forever
smoothing primer so I just smooth that
in and it makes your face feel like silk
and I just love it so much next thing I
do is concealer and I'm still using the
Naked skin by Urban Decay I've been
using this since my last everyday makeup
routine which was about 5 months ago so
I really really love this stuff so I
just put it anywhere I need extra
coverage so after I'm done with
concealer I always do foundation next
and I have been using the Too Faced Born
This Way one and I love this one so much
it is probably my all-time favorite
foundation and I really used to hate
liquid foundation because I was like oh
it feels so sticky on my face I would
only use powder this does not feel like
anything is on your face when you're
wearing it and it's very natural and I
just really love it ok so now I will set
my foundation and my concealer and I've
been using the Laura Mercier it just
plain translucent powder just put some
underneath my eyes I'm still using the
benefit hoola bronzer and you can tell
I'm almost out of it and that is so sad
it's okay boy take this little brush by
Sonia Kashuk and swirl it around and
then bronze up my face a little bit I
feel like if I lived on a desert island
and I had to bring three makeup items I
think I would choose bronzer mascara and
chapstick I feel like with those three
you're really set and you don't really
need anything else
so the blush that I've been using lately
is by Sonia Kashuk also and it's called
pink what a creative name for
highlighter I'm going to be using this
one and this one's by Estee Lauder and
it looks like a magical sunray and it's
called heatwave and so I'm just going to
apply some a miss on to a little paper
brush and put it on my cheekbones then I
always put some of the tip of my nose
because that probably does something
right look at that just a glorious
highlighter okay so next is the eyebrows
and I actually have been doing my
eyebrows pretty much every day lately
and I don't know I just think it really
makes a difference and it doesn't take
that long so I've been using the
anastacio soft brown eyebrow powder with
just a little angled brush and then I
just fill in my brows so after I fill in
my eyebrows I always set them with a
clear brow gel just to hold all the baby
hairs in place now it is time for the
eyes and that is my favorite part and
I've really been liking just a matte eye
and I really like just putting a mommy
color in the crease so today I'm going
to be using the Naked 2 palette and I'm
going to be using this color in the
crease and it's called tease so I'm just
going to get a little bit of that
plop that on in there I'm just going to
be taking a flat brush and I'm going to
be using the color foxy and just putting
that all over my lid
so then I take the same blending brush
that I was using before and then just
blend those two colors together next I'm
going to do eyeliner and I'm actually
not going to be doing a winged eyeliner
today even though I have done a winged
eyeliner on every single makeup video
I've done on YouTube so far because I
really do wear winged eyeliner a lot but
I'm just going to be taking this
eyeliner by Jordana this was like a
dollar at Walgreens and I'm just gonna
do a regular line of eyeliner at the top
of my biscuit so I usually go about half
way with this I just blend the eyeliner
out with a little brush so that is the
eyeliner on the first I've done and now
we're gonna do the second one the eyes
are pretty much done I'm just gonna
finish it off with some mascara and I'm
still using the benefit roller lash okay
now that my face is complete I am
actually going to be using a lipstick
that I am so excited about and actually
snapchatted and showed you guys when I
got these and I was like oh I love these
so much and so the color I am going to
be putting on today is number 314
okay so this is the finished makeup look
