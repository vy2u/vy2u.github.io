remember that if you remember that then
you've really been with me and Marcus
since the beginning but hi guys it is
Monday afternoon ish and I decided to
vlog camper is really chewing me a lot
but today I think the theme of this vlog
is gonna be organizing my life with you
because I just feel like every single
aspect of my life is very unorganized my
closet all my makeup all my house is
just a big mess but I got a very
exciting package in the mail a little
while ago and I wanted to show you some
of the things that I got I'm so excited
to be showing you guys this because I
know that you guys are gonna love this I
got this package in the mail from a
store called a thredUP
it's an online store and you can buy
second hand clothing from there but they
have amazing brands so I ordered a bunch
of stuff from them and I just want to
show you some of the things that I got
and I'm also gonna try it on first I'll
start with the shoes and these are so
adorable
these are from Aldo and they're just
these little camper you're really
distracting they're just adorable little
heels and they have this really pretty
wooden like geometric design heel oh I
just love these so much and they were
such a good price again I'll leave the
price right there on the screen I also
got these there's a brown shoe theme
these are from a brand that I had never
heard of but I think it's a really nice
brand
once my mom is based I've got these
brown boots from thredUP in look how
cute these are these are the cutest
Brown booties I've ever had and they
were such a good price and they're real
genuine leather I just love these so
much next thing I have here is this
little backpack it's so adorable
it has like light brown leather details
and it's kind of like this woven
material and it's super tiny I just
think this is perfect for like with a
little dress I just think that this is
so cute
I also got this gray dress it's a little
racerback dress it feels very soft it's
just a casual kind of like everyday
comfy dress that you can wear around the
house or anything like that next thing I
got are these leggings from made well I
got them in a size small they just have
a black elastic band and they're gray
all the way down they feel like they're
gonna be super super comfy and stretchy
so I'm excited about those and then the
last thing that I got I thought I could
use as like a beach cover-up because I
don't know it just reminds me of a beach
cover-up it's a white dress and it's
kind of oversized you'll be able to see
it better once I try it on but it's
oversized it has these cool little
details down it and it's a v-neck so
that's everything that I got this time
from thredUP but I know I'm definitely
gonna be ordering from them a lot
because I mean thrift shopping online I
just think that's the coolest concept
and it just kind of makes thrift
shopping in general a lot easier because
on thredUP you can actually enter your
size the clothing brand like I said the
color that you want so it just makes it
much quicker to find things and you're
still giving kind of like a new life to
clothes
so if y'all are interested in thredUP
they were super sweet and gave me an
amazing discount code you can use the
code kristan 40 and you can just click
the link that I'm going to put in my
description box and you can get 40% off
your first order saving up to $50 on
your order so if you guys
said I would definitely take advantage
of that deal because that's an amazing
deal so I'm so happy that thredUP is
sponsoring this video because how
perfect is it that I just did a thrift
store haul and a ton of you were saying
how overwhelming thrift store shopping
is and this is just like such a perfect
alternative I feel like now I'm just
gonna start cleaning up the house I'm
just gonna stay in this really comfy
outfit the leggings from made well and
then this cozy sweater um do you guys
feel like when you have to clean the
house the first thing you have to do is
make your bed because that is how I feel
like I feel like I can't start anything
without having a perfectly made bed so
I'm gonna do that really quick and then
after I make my bed I'm going to go
through my closet and try to get rid of
a bunch of stuff because right now my
closet is jam-packed like jam-packed so
I'm gonna try to get a big pile of
clothes that I can donate and and just
try to size down a little bit because
it's just getting a little bit stuffed
in there I made the bed Marquis let's
see it looks great
okay tell them where we're going no I'm
taking a shower today where are we going
we're going to Petsmart what is he okay
he looks like a dog you look like a
human okay so I'm gonna set you guys
right here maybe is this gonna be good
okay so here's the pile of clothes that
I decided to get rid of we got some
shirts we got this dress that I actually
wore this dress for our engagement
pictures but I just don't wear it
anymore just this white simple dress
some overalls this dress that I never
wore it's from whitefox it saw the tag
on it it's just this little pink
dress that I just I just don't need um I
also have this dress that's really cute
that I never wore but this one is really
cute it has little ties right here
I got a sweatshirt this pink sweatshirt
that I used to wear all the time this
little red romper from white fox that I
brought my honeymoon and another little
shirt that's really cute
but I just don't wear it enough and also
this navy blue just like regular dress
and what I think I'm gonna do is I might
put these on depop so that you guys can
check them out if you are interested in
any of them I've sold stuff on depop
before and it went really well
so if you guys want me to do that let me
know and I'll put these up there but now
I have a little bit of extra room in my
closet so now I'm in my little beauty
room I guess you could call it where I
get ready and keep like all my makeup
and filming stuff um but I just went
through all of my drawers which are
these that I keep all my makeup in and I
labeled them all and I got rid of a
bunch of makeup I also went through a
bunch of PR boxes of just makeup that I
didn't need and makeup that I was going
to keep so I have this huge tart bag
full of brand new untouched makeup I
decided that I'm going to do a four
hundred thousand subscriber giveaway and
I'll split this probably into two
different giveaway winners
here let me show you some of the things
you can get a little sneak peek we have
like art art self tanner a cute face
palette some Clinique foundations to
face bronzer that I've never used and I
actually have another one of these and I
love this bronzer some different liquid
lipsticks like a million different
lipsticks the matte ones and they like
liquid latex ones also very sad I left
for vacation for five days came back and
my beautiful plant is like I don't even
know if I can save this guy no it's
almost like it got over watered but
that's so weird because I was gone but
the leaves just feel very like soft I
don't know guys do you think I can bring
this back to life
I feel doubtful look at this once they
got a bath but I need us to sing a song
because you know you're
I will die I just cracked one of these
leaves which one's your favorite if you
choose just one
Oh same yeah it's my favorite one from
the bike the bike you just rode it to

from a walk with camper I don't know if
you can hear him drinking he's very hot
we met one of our neighbors that has a
golden doodle but it has white fur and
it's so cute and it made me want to get
another dog and the Marquis has really
been wanting another dog which we're so
crazy everyone we tell where they're
like guys really you should not get
another dog but sometimes just tempting
hood it'd be so nice for camper to have
a friend but we're not but sometimes you
just think about it you know see right
