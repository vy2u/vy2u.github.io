but it's all ready 123
who the heck just texted me and I'm kind
of just having one of those days where
I'm like trying to get a lot of stuff
done but I just feel like nothing is
going according to plan and so I'm
feeling a little bit like oh but it's
okay because I'm starting on my vlog now
and usually starting my vlogs like helps
me be like okay I need to get this done
in this thing because I kind of have
like video evidence of being on top of
things so my big goal and plan for today
is to kind of get this room a little bit
more decorated I feel like when we first
moved in this room which is like my
filming room I like makeup room I guess
you could call it it was like my main
focus to get it cute and already but
since then I kind of like neglected it
since like the first week that I moved
in I haven't really done much to
decorate it and I'm just feeling kind of
like uninspired in here just because
I've just put a lot of like random
pieces in here that I feel like don't
really go so that's my plan for today is
to kind of bring you guys along with me
while I sort of like finish decorating
this room random side note my camera is
completely jiggled like it's all messed
up and it's a huge problem so I'll show
you my flip screen like it's coming off
like it's not secure on the camera and
so every time I walk or move while I'm
vlogging it makes this like rattling
noise and it's because a screw came out
of the camera so that just makes it
really annoying to try and vlog because
I like have to be so careful to not make
it rattle but anyways speaking of my
room kind of getting redone a little bit
this came in the mail and this is
actually a new chair for my room because
I felt like sorry I'm walking you all
around I feel like I'm obsessed with
this chair but I just feel like it's not
going with like the modern vibe that I'm
trying to create in this room so we
might move this
chairs somewhere else or maybe get it
reupholstered because there are a lot of
like holes in the fabric I mean if you
guys don't know I found this chair on
the street for free so it's not like a
huge loss if we can't find somewhere to
put it but before we do anything we know
what time it is right it's time for
another thredUP unboxing I'm so glad
y'all love thredUP just as much as I do
I get so many questions from you guys to
do more thredUP hauls and I've noticed
that I've been getting a lot of comments
from you guys asking me like for
different tips about shopping on thredUP
like how to find super cute things and I
feel like since I've been shopping there
for so long I have definitely discovered
some tricks so I'm gonna tell you guys
and first I'm going to take everything
out of the box
so if you guys haven't seen one of my
thredUP hauls before or maybe you just
don't know what thredUP is it's
basically the world's largest online
thrift store and I'm a huge advocate for
second-hand shopping I think it's great
for the environment I think it's fun it
feels like you're kind of like treasure
hunting I wanted to kind of go through
the way that I shop on thredUP because I
know that it can be overwhelming because
a lot of stuff which is also exciting
but also can be overwhelming so they
have a search tab where you can enter in
whatever brand that you're searching for
so usually the ones I search for first
are free people anthropology Zara
Topshop sometimes Alison olivia lately
I've been loving so those are like just
five brands that I know that I love and
I'll kind of look through the selection
of what they have and then I'll usually
find a few things but if I don't find
anything like that then I'll go to their
new arrivals section and if I know I'm
looking for a coat or boots I'll specify
that and then I'll just scroll through
and I just wait until something catches
my eye and then I added to my cart so
the first thing I got is maybe the most
excited I've ever been about something
that I got from thredUP but I have been
wanting these exact shoes for so long
and just the fact that they had them and
they were in my size I was like I can't
pass this up I'd be so stupid to pass
this up so they are these boots from
rag-and-bone
and I've always wanted a pair of
bragging bone boots but I know if
they're very expensive so I've just been
holding off but when I found them on
thread up I was like happiest day of my
life everything about these shoes are
perfect and these were originally 495
dollars and I got them for at $99.99 and
then I also got a sweater from H&amp;amp;M this
is actually way way thicker and softer
than I thought it was gonna be and it's
a turtleneck because I love turtlenecks
and I got this for $7.99 it was
originally $24 but I just love the pink
color I also got another thing I forgot
about this that I'm so excited about
when I saw this I was like no no that is
made for me I was like that's that was
handmade for me but it's this little
French Connection clutch and it has
daisies on it it is adorable and
embroidered things make me so happy so
when I saw this I was just like yes yes
yes definitely definitely gonna get that
this was originally $119 and I got it
for $34 so I thought that was a great
deal let's just see what it looks like
on my shoulder I kind of wanna like
display this in my house that's how cute
it is so here's what it looks like I
love this and the next thing that I got
is a jacket from Urban Outfitters it
looks like this I'll just go ahead and
put it on because it's easy to just
throw on over this but I got this for
$15 this was originally $60 so a great
deal oh so here's what this jacket looks
like I feel like it's a perfect everyday
kind of jacket and thredUP is offering
you guys a 30% off of your first order
all you have to do is use my code
Kristin John's very simple and you can
just use the link that I'm gonna put
down in the description box and you guys
can get yourself a full discount okay
I'm gonna have to try and move this
really heavy box into this room over
here we'll see how this works
Marcus would normally
me with this but he just left for a
meeting so I'm just gonna have to do
this by myself and I'm also gonna have
to assemble this by myself so we'll see
how that goes
this is heavier okay okay time to read
the instructions I just put the seat on
completely wrong that's supposed to be
the back of the seat and then then I
just put the freaking bottom of the seat
where the actual cushions should be so I
have to take this all off and then flip
it around like real big dummy I hate
myself right now and I'm just waiting
for Marcus this thing was so hard to put
together
did I even do it right I don't know it's
kind of wobbly and I have a few screws
left and I don't know what it's done
here is what it looks like the chair
that took me two hours to put together I
do the first sitting test feels pretty
sturdy actually I mean I'm gonna warn
all my guests to just definitely be
gentle with this chair because I know
it's probably missing some bolts so
here's what the room looks like now I
feel like that chair goes way better
with the room then the floral one but
these are all things that I had to hang
on my wall these I had in my old house
and they're just really cute little
shelves I could put these right here
which I think would be cute like right
by this mirror and I also have this
print that a subscribers that meet that
I definitely want to hang in here I have
this be kind sign that I want to hang
and then I thought it would be cute to
maybe do like a little like hat
decoration type thing like hang my hats
in some sort of cute way Marcus you want
to see what I've put together all by
myself yes here he
but be careful because I some screws
didn't make it be careful with it it's
not how cherish work you should have to
be careful of the chair break for
recycling nails from the previous owners
of our house hmm it's not great but you
can probably make it work okay here's
what it looks like I really like how it
turned out
and it's still not all done but I like
this um view way better than before me
and Marcus are going on an adventure
so look I'm gonna wear my new shoes in
my new jacket and we're ready here
she got wait a second I just realized
that bit bag is huge what did you get
dude the whole store hey you know there
was a notice from our YouTube videos
here her name is Laura she yes she said
hi
dad oh oh
shoes oh those are all the things I
could have possibly wanted and I got
myself lady watch it that's something
I'll explode
do you know where you're at right now no
where's that ring the bell huh that's
where we went on our anniversary and I
didn't realize this but that's in the
shape of a heart that kinda looks like a
pretzel so we found a trail it's time to
go off-road even though we don't have
four-wheel drive walking down this hill
so you guys can see toot-toot keep going
that's it there it goes this is actually
pretty steep it did so good
Marcus what we'll try it more dear Jesus
please let this car start cuz we're in
the middle of nowhere like honestly
we're in the middle of nowhere I don't
know why we just got it I put it in park
and I headed Jocelyn back and forth so I
guess get it to engage in park so we
could start I'm pretty sure that was the
only problem I'm not turning us off
again
do you think that there's a way we won't
get up that yeah there could be and
we'll just go back down it's okay okay
ready
that junk is pretty steep - alright here
we go I gotta get traction
Oh
we're stuck we're stuck okay okay let's
go back down just roll down straight go
down I just give it one more try no no
more try the transmitter
what's the transmitter if we had a
locker it'd be so fine only one wheel
spilling spinning right now so that was
two wheel drive and I was actually I was
feeling that we were it smells like
burning yeah cuz the tires very big we
just got home and I've just been in here
kind of like tooling around trying to
like move things around to see kind of
what I like I think the thing that's
gonna make this room feel way more cozy
is when I have my rug in here because
it's like a nice white rug but what I
have decided is that I'm gonna paint
this white because I just think it's
gonna brighten things up a little bit
and then I'm debating on whether to put
prints on this wall or to hang those two
shelves but let me know just made a
really quick little dinner but you ever
really want some chicken some corn and
salad this is like our go-to wouldn't
you say okay guys it is time for bed I
need to go change into my pajamas
because I'm still in my jeans honey
it's playing right next to me and I
thought this was just a perfect time to
end the vlog so I'm going to end with a
verse that I think is so encouraging
so it's Philippians one at nine through
ten and it says this is my prayer for
you that your love will keep growing
more and more with knowledge and greater
discernment so that you will be able to
make the right choices and I think that
this spoke to me so much just because
God wants us to be able to discern which
things you should be doing and which
things
shouldn't be doing which doors you
should be walking in what doors you
shouldn't be walking in and another
thing that I keep reminding myself is
like if you're having a hard time
discerning something or figuring out
what to do God is waiting and he wants
you to ask for his help and he wants to
help you through situations so that's
what I've really been learning lately I
hope that maybe encourages you guys I
hope you guys enjoyed this vlog and if
you did give it a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
