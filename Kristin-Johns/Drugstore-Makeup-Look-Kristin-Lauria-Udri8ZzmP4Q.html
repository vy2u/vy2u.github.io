makeup look and it is actually in all
drugstore makeup look as you can
probably tell from the title just wanted
to share with you guys some of my
favorite products from the drugstore I
wanted to show you guys some things that
are very affordable but still very very
good quality so I hope you guys like
this video and I hope that you find it
helpful and so if you want to see how I
got this makeup then just keep watching
hi guys so the first thing that I'm
going to be doing today is my foundation
and I've never shown this foundation on
a video before but I use it a lot
especially in the summertime it's the
L'Oreal True Match and this is
definitely my favorite foundation from
the drugstore I think it blends
amazingly and it gives a really good
coverage and it looks really natural on
which I always look for so I just put a
little bit of that foundation on and now
I'm just gonna put it on my face this
foundation actually really reminds me of
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
just the consistency and how much
coverage it has so if you don't want to
spend like a ton of money on the Too
Faced one I would highly recommend
getting the L'Oreal one because they
really remind me of each other a lot and
I'm going to be using the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer and I
actually have to mix this one and light
with a little bit darker shade because I
think this is a little bit too light for
me right now but I really love this
concealer a lot so then I'm just going
to take this other Real Techniques brush
and this is the setting brush this is
the brush I always used to win that
concealer and I'm just gonna blend that
all out okay concealer is done and now
I'm going to set it all and this guy's
is a sad story because this Maybelline
Dream matte powder is my favorite powder
of all time
they actually discontinued it I still
get mine from Amazon for like five bucks
I'm going to be using this fluffy brush
from Ecotools to set all my makeup and
you can get Ecotools brushes from I
think anywhere okay the next thing is
bronzer and I'm really sad about this
because I know that I have a drug for
bronzer it's the maybelline color stay
or is it L'Oreal color stick but I will
link that bronzer down below and I'm
telling you guys I really love it and
it's really amazing so let's just
pretend that I'm going to be using that
bronzer the brush that I'm using for my
bronzer is the Sonia Kashuk one the same
one that I used in my last video and
again I really like this one but the
only thing is that sometimes it sheds a
little bit like you can see there
there's just like little black hairs
which is annoying like brushes are the
one thing that's kind of hard to find
really good quality ones at the
drugstore but I'm sure there are some
out there but I just haven't really
found any that don't shed like crazy
besides the Real Techniques brushes
these are the best drugstore makeup
brushes in my opinion for blush I'm
going to be using the Maybelline master
highlight and this is in 40 mauve and
this is my favorite blush from the
drugstore it's so pretty and it has a
little bit of shimmer in it so you don't
really have to use a highlight if you
don't want to and I just love it I think
gives you such a pretty glow and I just
think it's the perfect color for
everyday I hope that they still have
them because I don't know if they were a
limited edition or not but they should
still have them and I think I got this
like a year ago but I would just say if
you are using one of these use a very
light hand because they are very very
pigmented okay so for my eyebrows I'm
actually going to be using the morphe
35o palette and there is just a ton of
colors to choose from in here and I'm
going to be using this color right here
it's just like a light taupey color
okay and now to set my eyebrows I'm
going to be using the Milani brow
shaping clear wax really keeps them in
place all day so I really like this
stuff okay so the thing that I think
about the drugstore is that they have a
ton of amazing shimmery eyeshadows but I
kind of find it hard to find really good
matte eyeshadows that blend really well
so I'm going to be using the morphe 35o
palette I know this isn't from the
drugstore necessarily but it's still
really really cheap seeing this color
right here and just popping that in my
crease for my lip color today I'm going
to be using this one by Lori oh it's
called amber rush the infallible
eyeshadows and it just comes in these
little pots and I think these are more
like pressed pigments so I'd like to use
them with my fingers but these
eyeshadows
are amazing I love them so much they're
so pretty look how pretty that is so
sparkly so I'm going to be using this on
my lid so then I'm just going to take
that same fluffy brush that I used for
my matte eyeshadow and just kind of
blend out the edges of this color I'm
just going to pick up a little bit of
this shimmery brown color and put that
on the outer corners of my eyes just to
deepen it up a little bit and then since
I was blending a lot I'm just going to
add a little bit more of the amber Rush
color onto the center of my lids just to
make it a little bit more pigmented okay
now that the eye shadow is pretty much
done I'm gonna take this Milani brow and
I highlight and it just comes in a
little pencil form and there's a
shimmery side and a matte side so I'm
just going to take the matte side and
draw it right underneath my eyebrows and
then I'll just blend that out with my
finger now I'm going to be taking my
Physicians Formula eye booster and y'all
know this is my favorite eyeliner I use
it all the time and it's very affordable
I just love everything about it so I'm
just gonna do a winged eyeliner so I
always start by just kind of doing a
rough line on my
eyelid and then just drawing the wing
and connecting it to that line first I
done with the winged eyeliner and now I
will go do the second one
so for mascara today I'm going to be
using Jordana best lash extreme this is
an amazing mascara from the drugstore if
they haven't changed the price I'm
pretty sure when I got this it was like
$2.99
but it's amazing it just has a wand like
this and it really does give you so much
volume so if you love volume you're
really gonna love this mascara so for
the last thing with the eyes I'm going
to be using this Jane liquid eyeliner
and metallic nude and you can get these
from Ulta I think in the drugstore
section and I'm just going to be putting
that on the little inner corner of my
eye just to brighten it up and just to
do something a little bit different
really think that metallic eyeliner
makes the eyes look a lot brighter and I
think it just gives a nice tug to it and
I really really like those eyeliners I
think they're really really good so for
lipstick today I'm going to be wearing
the Maybelline elixir an intoxicating
spice and these are like glossy
lipsticks I don't really know how to
explain them but they're so comfortable
on the lips okay guys that is the end of
this video I hope that you liked this
makeup look I think that the drugstore
has a ton of amazing makeup options to
choose from and they're also really
affordable I can positively say that I
love every single makeup product that I
used in this video so I hope that you
