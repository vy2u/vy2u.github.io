I've been getting so many comments from
y'all wanting a house tour that I would
show you guys a little bit around the
house give you some updates kind of make
a little blog type video for y'all
because I really do want to show you all
my new house but it's definitely not
anywhere near finished being decorated
yet because that takes a while so I
wanted to show you guys maybe I don't
know what the heck I'm going to title
this video but basically it's going to
be a slightly empty house tour but our
bedroom is pretty much done our living
room this is where I am right now has
half a couch so definitely not done and
as you can see all of our shelves are
empty because what you even put on that
many shelves I have no idea and what
gave me this idea is because I ordered
some stuff and it came in today and you
can probably see the boxes back there so
I'm going to be unboxing some exciting
furniture things for you guys so I can
show you guys because I think that will
be fun but I'm very excited for today's
video because I like vloggy type of
chill videos and I think that you guys
do too
I'm going to wait till Marcus gets home
to open the packages but I guess I can
show you around a little bit right now I
am in our living room this is what our
living room looks like it's a little
overview there's our front door right
there and then our cabinet we actually
painted those cabinets they used to be
like kind of an old brown color because
they were wood and then we painted dents
and look much nicer much newer but we
really don't have very much in this room
yet we are still waiting for the other
half of our couch so right now it's just
like a couch chair but we also have this
little rocking chair which we got from a
place called cb2 and we wanted that for
the living room because we thought it is
really cute and then I have that thing
but I still need to decorate basically
decorating a house takes a long time and
you just can't do it all at once or
you'll go bankrupt that's
I've learned I am definitely kind of a
perfectionist when it comes to
decorating and having my living space
how I want it so it's been kind of hard
for me to just understand that it's not
going to all come together right away
half a couch okay big blank wall I love
you too another thing is we got this
pillow from pillow pillow from Urban
Outfitters
it's very adorable we also have one that
looks like this in our room and I just
love it so if you guys are curious where
I got these pillows they're from urban
and actually we got a ton of our
furniture from Urban Outfitters they
just have some really good sale items
they're actually having a huge sale the
other day which is why I bought some
more little furniture pieces from them
and I also bought some clothes from this
so that's what's in some of those boxes
over there from our infant home hey
Marcus home and we we received another
package which is very exciting for boys
so here is the mattress which is insane
because it comes in such a tiny box this
is from the company called Lowell and
they were so nice and they sent us a few
mattresses so we have one in our master
bedroom and then we also have excellence
which I'm so excited about the Caesar
seriously the comfiest mattresses ever
so here's our top edge mattress comes in
a little sausage roll
Wow you can hear it
decompressing it's like I'm free I'm
free it's getting sad there it is
does it feel comfy John this is called
NASA's chest fall and if it hurts it
means your mattress is not just for a
very just right time hey you're comfy so
comfy but now I don't make it so then
the whole room will feel more victory
here's what the bed looks like and the
most important part is that it's comfy
which it definitely is huh also show you
guys our our bed in our bedroom because
we also have one of those Lowell
mattresses and here I won't show you all
my whole room because I want to do a
house tour once it's all completed but
here's what our bed looks like right now
no I've lighting is so blue but Oh guys
this bed is so comfy that it's like
dangerously comfy so I'll show you we
have the same Lowell mattress in here
and we've been sleeping on this for like
a month now and we love it so much it's
so hard to get out of bed that's the bad
part because it really doesn't make you
want to stay in bed for ever so again
thank you so much to Lowell for letting
us try out those mattresses seriously
guys if you're looking for a new
mattress they are amazing okay and we
have two other boxes that arrived today
I don't think this one is furniture I
think it might be
play whoa American hat yeah I bought
that for you really yeah it's for your
keys or for towels hiring is the keys
around you are like wow it's for towel
or or it's for to put up in the entry
ways that people can hang their coats
off okay yeah well yeah it was here
existed how cute it is it was on super
sale and now we can both be wearing half
okay next box this is the box I've been
waiting for I hope I think I think it's
my plant basket yep oh my plant back hey
guys this is my what would we call this
my beauty room it's not finished yet so
I don't want to show you all the whole
thing but I'm gonna have this in this
corner with some plants in it by the way
that's not a real cow hide it's fake
don't worry oh you should put my tiny
succulent in there an implant now you
didn't notice this video isn't
necessarily supposed to be about clothes
it's more about my house I still I'm
going to show you the clothes that I got
from urban because maybe it will be
interesting to you so um I got this
sweater and it is very cute it has
stripes on the sleeves and it's like
it's like an oversized sweatshirt what's
exercise I get in this small well it
seems huge
so basically urban was having 40% off
all their sale items and that's why I
got that basket thing because it ends up
being so cheap and I also bought some
clothes because they were also on sale
so I also bought this it's just a white
t-shirt really soft material I live in
these type of shirts because they're
just so comfy and easy to throw on and I
like wearing these with a little like
lacy brawler I think it looks really
cute
so I got that I also got
which i think is going to be really cute
even though we're going into the summer
so it might be too hot for it this all
we can't really tell a camera but it has
like this little neck cutouts it goes
like this on your neck and then it's
long-sleeve it's just like a cute basic
shirt I think I'm really going to like
this because I love olive green and
clothes they sit it's like a little
oversized t-shirt but it's a really nice
material it's kind of like silky this is
what was the shirts looks like do you
like this color this why are you
laughing okay so here's the first one I
feel like I could go on a safari Oh
special blip-it
this is slowly shirt it's ripped face
huh yeah turn around no it comes like
that oh yeah Oh interesting
yeah guys my biggest advice would be
find a husband that's really good at
fixing things because Marcus has fixed
so many things they're under house I
just don't even know what we'd do
without him he's a handyman
thanks for some best invention ever well
the basket was outfitted afterwards but
we put on show them our latest addition
Kristin Apple Bell we put some pegs on
the back and Kristin sits on this pillow
that just assists on top is better and
then we go zip everywhere
okay so it's a little bit later now and
as well in the vlog or as a video but I
realized that I didn't show you much of
the house yet I just showed you the
guest room in a little bit of the living
room I don't want to show you my filming
room yet or our bedroom yet because I
want that to be in like the real house
tour but I'm going to show you the
kitchen area because that's pretty much
done and I feel like y'all have seen
some clips of it already but this is our
dining room what it looks like we got
this little African mud cloth from a
little store in Malibu that was really
cute and then here is our little kitchen
area it's a really good-size kitchen I
really like cooking in here we have the
sinks right here and then it looks like
there's a lot of storage which I really
like and there is the microwave and the
dishwasher and there's actually this
indoor grill which we haven't used yet
but that's really cool and then right
through there is our bedroom and then
right back into the living room okay
guys that is it for this video I really
hope that y'all enjoyed seeing a little
sneak peek of our house and some
unboxings of some exciting things that
we're adding to our house but again I
definitely will be doing an entire house
tour once everything is decorated I love
you guys so much and if you want me to
do kind of more decorating type videos
just let me know if that's something
that you would want to see and I'll
definitely do that more okay I love you
guys so much
and I will see you very soon bye
