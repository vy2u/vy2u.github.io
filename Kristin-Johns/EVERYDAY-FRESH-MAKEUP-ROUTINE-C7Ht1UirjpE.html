what my updated makeup routine and kind
of let you guys get ready with me at the
same time just kind of like talking
through everything and I would say what
would I call this makeup look I would
kind of call it like in everyday super
fresh but really pretty makeup look in
the first most important part of this
makeup look is 100% the moisturizer
because when you put on your foundation
you want your skin to be really prepped
and moisturized and prepared because if
you're applying foundation over dry skin
it's just gonna look much more cakey and
unnatural so the one that I've been
using lately and loving is this first
aid beauty coconut water cream when
first aid beauty reached out to me and
wanted me to try this I was so excited
because if you've been watching me for a
while you know I love first day beauty
and I've used their skincare for years
now and it's like the only skincare that
I trust it looks like this it's like a
really nice light gel I don't know if
you can tell but I've already used so
much because I've been using this at
night and before I put on my makeup in
the morning and usually skincare is
formulated with just regular water so
since this has coconut water as its main
ingredient it's just super hydrating and
amazing for your skin it's also oil-free
and non comedogenic which is amazing for
people with sensitive skin and when you
put this on you don't feel like it's
just sitting on top of your skin you can
really tell that it is sinking in you
know how some moisturizers give you like
a barrier it's like it's like you can
tell that your skin is moisturize but
you're like is this stuff just sitting
on top of my skin that's not how this is
at all this is very much like
penetrating your skin really refreshing
it and making your face just feel so
nice and if you're looking for a new
moisturizer I think that this is a great
one and I'm gonna be priming with the
Hello fab coconut skin smoothie priming
moisturizer and this is a chewing on
formula so it's actually priming at
Hydra
at the same time I just rub that all
over and make sure to get everywhere
even like under my eyes I'm gonna be
mixing together at two foundations today
I'm using the Too Faced Born This Way in
the shade warm beige and they lemare
soft fluid foundation in the shade of
blush and I'm mixing these two together
because mixing them together makes me
have like my perfect shade and I've
actually been taking a break from my BD
blender for a while but when I use it
for the first time the other day I was
kind of reminded how it doesn't give you
as much coverage as a brush but it
really does make your foundation look
really nice and fresh and natural I'm
gonna put my hair really quick just so
I'm not blending my foundation onto my
hair and my next key to really pretty
natural skin are the Marc Jacobs
dewdrops I've talked about these a lot
on my channel already but I don't think
I've ever used them and like in a video
where I'm doing my makeup so I kind of
just rub this in between my fingers and
Pat it on my cheekbones down my nose
Cupid's bow and then when you blend it
in with your Beauty Blender it looks way
less crazy
and then over top of that I'm gonna be
adding my concealer and I've been using
a lot less concealer than usual just
because I feel like when you add a lot
of concealer it can tend to look a
little bit heavy underneath your eyes or
at least my eyes because I have like
little lines under there but if you add
less concealer I feel like it's less
likely to kind of like build up under
there and for powder I'm going to be
using the Laura Mercier translucent
powder this is something that never
changes and I don't know if it will ever
change but I'm just gonna be using a
little bit of that powder just to make
everything stay in place so I'm gonna be
adding some bronzer this is a cosmetic
sunshine and a compact and I'm going to
be putting that on the same brush that I
just used for powder and kind of just
bronzing everything up I'm not really
contouring or doing anything harsh just
because I want to keep everything really
natural looking and it's a blush today
I'm using the Too Faced pop adult peach
blush which is such a cute name and I
love using this blush because it
very glowy and it also has a really
pretty like peachy mauve color to it so
I'm using that on my blush brush tapping
some off and then for highlighter we're
not gonna go crazy but I'm gonna be
using the champagne pop highlighter from
Becca and I'm gonna be putting that on a
sigma tapered highlighting brush have a
camper hair in this brush and also I'm
gonna be putting it down my nose I used
to not put highlighter down my nose but
I think it's actually kind of nice
looking and then after my skin I've been
setting my face with like a setting
spray this is the Urban Decay all
nighter I love this one and I should not
talk during this actually before I do my
brows I need to pluck some strays
because it's getting wild up in here and
now it is brow time I'm using the
anastacio soft brown eye powder and I'm
just gonna fill in all of the sparse
areas in my eye brows some days when I
wake up I'm like wow my eyebrows are
like very full and nice and then some
days I wake up I'm like well my eyebrow
hair go it's so weird
okay now we're gonna head over to
eyeshadow town and for eyeshadow town
it's gonna be a quick simple stop y'all
are gonna be like what that's like
nothing we're just taking a light cream
shade and just putting that all over our
lives all over just as sloppily as you
want and then we're gonna take another
fluffy brush and use this mid brown
color and I sometimes mix the brown and
pink together just like anything
anything you want and it frees to just
define it a little bit and just put that
in to your crease and then we're gonna
take a tiny brush with whatever bronzer
you're using
and run that underneath your eye see how
smoky and pretty that is this is my
favorite part because I never used to do
this and I did it one day and I'm like
why have I never done this before you're
gonna be taking some really natural just
like snot sparse but just like very cute
natural subtle lashes
and put your glue on there because then
we're gonna be putting on our mascara
and you need these to get a little bit
tacky we're not gonna be putting on any
eyeliner that's the trick to make this
look look really just pretty and natural
and I always thought that you had to put
on eyeliner if you were putting on
eyelashes like fake eyelashes but you
really don't have to and it looks really
pretty when you just have on lashes so
just put on a little bit of mascara
doesn't matter which one I'm just gonna
put these on as close as I can to my
lash line to really disguise the band of
them and if you get a good pair of
lashes the band won't be too thick so
I'm just gonna plop these on and just
make sure you're really squeezing at the
band so that your natural lashes and the
strip of lashes are blending together
really well I just think that the
natural lashes give your look a little
bit of an extra something but without
looking too like overdone so the last
thing you gotta do is our lips I'm going
to be using a big Kylie lip liner and
ginger kind of just everywhere all over
my lips and over top of the lip liner
I'm going to be adding this tart it's
kind of like a lip balm it really
doesn't have very much color at all it's
just really glossy and I'm just gonna
kind of Pat that all over oh this one is
in the color rose okay guys that is the
finished makeup look I really hope that
you enjoyed this video I am obsessed
with this makeup and I've been wearing
it every single day and I don't plan on
stopping anytime soon just because it's
so fast since you're skipping eyeliner
and since I've been practicing with fake
eyelashes so much I feel like I'm so
quick at them now so something about the
fresh bronzy skin mixed with like the
lashes it's just a really pretty look
and if you enjoyed this video please

guys I hope that you have a great rest
of your day and I will see you very soon
