about lash extensions I'm literally
gonna cover A to Z about lash extensions
because I've gotten so many questions
about them and and a lot of you seem
really interested so I'm happy to make
this video for you all so I am in a
brand new room I'm back in Tallahassee
and we moved houses so this is a brand
new room I'm not done decorating it yet
but I'm super excited to show you guys
how I decorate it oh maybe do a new room
tour if you guys would want me to
because you really seem to like my last
one also if you learn anything from this
video or it's helpful please give it a
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
to my channel okay let's get started
okay first I will zoom you in and show
you what my eyelashes look like right
now
it's been about a week since I got them
filled and so this is what they look
like and they still have a ton of volume
and links or some spots in there that
don't have an eyelash extension because
they fall out within like three to four
weeks depending on your lash cycle but
that is what they look like right now
maybe I should explain first before I go
into all that what an eyelash extension
is because a lot of your lip what the
heck is an eyelash extension so eyelash
extensions are little individual
eyelashes that go onto your natural
eyelash so my finger will be my natural
eyelash so what they do is take the
little single eyelash super lightweight
super like does not feel like anything
and they just stick it with really
really really like surgical grade glue
onto your natural lashes so that they
won't fall out and so that's what an
eyelash extension is and they usually
lasts up to three to four weeks before
you need to get them filled and when you
get them filled that just means that
they are filling in the spots that
naturally
out with your natural lash cycle and so
your natural lashes shed naturally like
when you have an eyelash on your face
that's just your eyelashes shedding
naturally so obviously there's going to
be eyelash extensions that fall out so
you do have to go get them filled and
that's a really important part to know
about eyelash extensions they're not
just gonna stay perfect until you take
them off they stay until your lashes
start falling out naturally and I'll try
to find a picture of my eyelashes before
I get a fill like in the fourth week
period that they are kind of sparse so
I'll try to find a picture and insert it
here so you can just kind of see what
they start to look like after you've had
them on for a really long time and you
haven't gotten them filled so my first
tip is definitely it to do your research
because you don't want to go to a place
and have different expectations than
what they can actually do there is
different types of eyelash extensions
there's the volume lash extensions which
have like three to four individual
lashes on to like one little point so
there's four lashes in one and then
there's just the classic version that
has just one on each lash which gives
you a much more natural look the first
few times that I got eyelash extensions
I got the classic version because I
didn't even know that there was volume
lash extensions and I liked them but
they were just really really really
natural so I didn't feel like they were
really worth that much money the next
thing on here I want to talk about is
price it are a very very very very
pricey habit and that is why I'm
probably not going to continue to get
them over the school year but I think
that they're really good if you want to
go to like a special event or something
like I'm definitely going to get them
for my wedding but they are not cheap
and if you do get them cheap that is
because the eyelash technician is not
doing them very well from my experience
at least usually for a very good quality
lash extension set you're going to have
to pay around 150 to 200 dollars there
are people that do them for like 50
dollars but I'm telling you guys cheaper
is not better because
it is your eyelashes that you're dealing
with and you don't want them to get
harmed so I would definitely go with
someone that's in the 150 to $200 range
because they're going to be using better
quality eyelashes they're going to be
more trained and they're gonna take
their time on the application so that's
usually how much they are to get the
first full set on and then eyelash bills
usually range from like $59 to $100
which is super pricey but again it is
worth it to get a good lash technician
because you don't want to be going to
some sketchy place that's gonna like
ruin your eyelashes because that's my
biggest fear
okay the next thing I wanted to talk
about is the care of your eyelash
extensions because like I said before
they are pretty high maintenance so
firstly you cannot get them wet within
the first 24 hours of getting them
applied so I would recommend going to
your lash technician place and shower
before you go because you're not
supposed to shower that night because
the eyelashes aren't completely set and
if you get them wet then they won't last
as long so that's really important to
know to not get them wet for 24 hours so
the next thing to know about taking care
of them is that you have to wash them
every night or else you can get an eye
infection because if you don't wash the
base of your eyelashes then oils and
stuff build up and it can just clog your
eyelash pores which I even know where
thing and you can end up getting an eye
infection so what I do is I get a little
foam squirt bottle and I put a little
bit of baby shampoo like maybe like that
much and then fill the rest with water
and then I shake it up and pump a little
bit onto my fingers and just run them
through each of my eyes so I can really
get them all clean and so I won't get
one of those eyelash infections because
my lady was telling me about that and it
does not sound fun so I usually do this
every single night if I can remember and
that's really important because this
will actually keep your eyelashes on
longer and just make them more healthy
and happy the next thing that's really
important about eyelash extensions is
having a little spooley but these are
going to be your best friends because
like regular eyelashes your eyelashes
can cross over each other they can just
like start to look a little bit messy
because they are super long and so all
you have to do is brush through them
every morning and every night and that
will just keep them all in place and
looking nice and not like weird and like
you have like weird tangled eyelashes
the next important thing when you have
eyelash extensions is to not use any
oil-based products on them so make sure
that you get oil-free makeup remover you
don't use any like oils around your eyes
at night and this is the eye makeup
remover that I use I just use it with a
q-tip whenever I do wear any eye makeup
and it's just the oil free makeup
remover by a Neutrogena and I use that
on a q-tip if I do ever wear any like
eyeliner or eye shadow and I also don't
use pencil or liquid eyeliner when I
have eyelash extensions on and I don't
wear it mascara with it cuz both of
those are very hard to remove right at
your lash line and it can just kind of
make them not last as long so if I do
wear eyeliner it's usually just like
black eye shadow smudge on my lash line
but I usually don't feel like I really
need to just because that eyelash
extensions look really pretty and nice
without any eye makeup on okay guys I
think that is about it that I have to
say about eyelash extensions I might
have missed something and if I do I'll
put it in the description bar but if you
have any more questions just put them in
the comments and I'll try to answer them
for you guys and please don't forget to
subscribe to my channel for new videos
every single week and I love you guys so
much and I will see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
