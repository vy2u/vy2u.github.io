filming my everyday makeup look I've
never filmed a video like this before so
I hope that I do it right but it's
really really easy um but I have a lot
of you guys requests on my Instagram and
my last video to do my everyday makeup
look so that is what I'm doing today and
yeah so let's just get started first
thing I usually do is start with primer
and this is one is by Tarte and so I
just take a little bit on my finger and
then I just put that like all my cheeks
and on my forehead so I just press that
in with my finger next go in with
concealer and this one is by urban decay
and I usually just put that on
underneath my eyes and also around my
nose and anywhere else that is looking
weird and then I blend it in with like a
little little fluffy brush
so next I usually go in with like powder
or something um I have been really
liking this one by Smashbox and it's
just a perfecting powder and I really
like it because you twist it and all
stuff comes out and it just makes a
really happy so I usually use this brush
by Ecotools you can get this a quick
anywhere I get a little bit on my brush
and then I just put it all over my face
and this is just very easy and quick so
I just kind of buff it in and I also put
this on my neck to make sure all blended
in and for bronzer I use this one it's
pula by benefit and then I just put it
underneath my cheekbones okay now I'm
just putting it around my forehead and
Condors everywhere now next I do blush
and for blush this is like the only
blush that I ever use it's by Mac and
it's called chin tool and I love it it's
using an angled blush brush and get a
little bit on there and then go like
this I'm going to use this palette by
Mac and I'm going to start with just a
matte Brown to put my priest
after I put that brown in the crease I'm
just gonna take a lighter color it's
just like a light champagne color and
I'm going to put that on my eyelid okay
now it is time to blend it all out so
I'm just gonna use a big fluffy brush
and just kind of go I kind of go with
this in like little circular motions and
just blend it out I'll blend it out I
don't know if you can see it I am going
to move on to eyeliner and I always use
this one it's Physicians Formula a
booster and it's just a black liquid
eyeliner this is really like the hardest
part or the part that takes the longest
so I start by just doing a line across
the top of my eye and then I kind of
smooth it
and then I am gonna do the wing start by
doing a little line and then I'm going
to connect it and there it is and now
I'm going to do the other guy
okay now the eyeliner is done so I
usually do mascara now and first I curl
my eyelashes and for mascara I use the
benefit roller lash I really like this
mascara a lot okay now I put some clear
brow gel and my eyebrows just so they
don't go crazy you're in the day when
I'm really really doing my makeup like
fancy makeup I'll do my eyebrows but
every day I just don't because I'm too
lazy now my favorite part and this is by
Becca and it is called opals and then I
just put that on a little tiny fresh one
and put that on top of my cheekbones
and a little bit down it is and last
thing is lips and so I always use this
color from Mac it's called shame in your
coffee and I just love this color it is
a Molly color and then on top of it I
put this little cutie lip gloss by buxom
and sugar and I think that is it that is
how I do my everyday makeup hope you
