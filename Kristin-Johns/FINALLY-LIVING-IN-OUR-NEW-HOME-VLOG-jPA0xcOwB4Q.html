vlogged in so long I kind of forgot how
to vlog so hopefully today goes smoothly
but I'm so happy because today is gonna
be the first day I get to vlog in our
new house of course it won't start to
vlog in our house I'm actually on my way
to a boxing class but I'm so excited
because I can kind of like show you guys
around the house a little bit more now
that it's decorated today and I'm going
to be doing some more decorating so it's
gonna be fun we just got home from
boxing I am so sweaty I'm running my
shower right now but then I was thinking
I was like wait some of you guys
probably don't follow me on instagram
and also some of you probably don't
follow me and Marcus's Channel together
and then you might have no idea what I'm
talking about when I said I'm filming in
the new house today but if you didn't
know we bought our first house together
so yeah sorry if I just kind of like
threw that upon you and you didn't even
really know what I was talking about
okay so I just got out of shower I put a
little bit of makeup on and I make
shifted myself a little tripod look at
this so I just got this box of mail most
of you guys are already gonna know what
this is but it's just a huge box of
clothes that I ordered thread up and I'm
so loving you guys love thread up as
much as I do because you guys know I am
a secondhand shopper I love going to
thrift stores I love like finding unique
pieces that aren't like in every single
store at the moment you don't know what
thread up is it is basically a huge
online site at hand clothing store and
you can really customize your shopping
experience because you can type in
j.crew anthropology Madewell or you can
search there like more higher-end things
things that are going to be less
expensive and you can search your size
color so it's just really easy to shop
on thredUP so the first thing in my box
I just wow so soft this is a sweater
from Tory Burch I actually think that
this might
long enough so you can wear this with
leggings but I'll have to try it on see
I've been loving this exact color of red
so much I've accumulated like a few bits
and pieces the next thing that I got is
from brandy melville and it's just it's
kind of like the sweater I'm wearing now
but it's a little bit of like a thinner
material and I'm obsessed with shirts
like this as you can tell I just love
things that you can throw over and
they're not too tight and they're just
really comfortable so brandy melville
has amazing stuff like that I also got
these which I thought looked kind of
like faux leather pants but they are
definitely leggings I don't know if you
can see but they're kind of like shiny
and I've always liked the look of
leather pants but also I've tried on
leather pants and they're not the most
comfy so I thought like a faux leather
legging would be a good option and I
actually thought two things from Alice
and Olivia which I love that brand but I
don't usually buy it cuz it's very
expensive but such a good deal of thread
up so I had to this is just a really
nice flowy white top this looks like an
amazing shirt and I can't wait to try it
on because like these sleeves and that
like bunching at the bottom I think this
is gonna be so pretty and I also got
this dress from Alison Olivia which is
also adorable it looks like this it's
kind of like this seersucker material
and it ties on the side it has a little
collar and I don't know if this looked
adorable online hopefully it looks cute
on me and the last thing that I got is
from the brand what are you from this is
from the brand vents kamudu
Camuto oh all right just a long jump
suit here's one of the legs and this
feels like it's gonna be so comfy like I
could sleep in it okay so that is
everything you're gonna go out this time
from thread up and thread out this
offering you guys a 40% off all you have
to do is click the link below and use
the code kristan 40 and you can get 40%
off which is amazing because these
clothes are already discounted so you're
just getting like a double deal guys
this is like the first time that I'm
filming in my kitchen which makes me so
happy because honestly the first thing I
thought of when we were looking at this
house was how right and happy
this kitchen is and how amazing it would
be to film in here so I'm filming in
here for the first time it's just wow so
happy I think I'm just gonna make
something really easy simple because I'm
making my shrimp tacos tonight which I'm
very excited about and I just don't want
to put that much effort into lunch which
is usually how it goes in my heart I
honestly cannot get over these tulips
and I just want you to see them a little
bit closer tulips are actually my mom's
favorite flower and so whenever I have
them in my house I really think about my
mom so mom if you're watching this I
wish you were here so I could give you
some but yeah these are just so stinking
beautiful
I just finished lunch and I don't know
why this is really random but I just
want to try a lipstick that I've never
tried before because I have like I have
this more of lipstick and the thing is a
lot of times someone will send me a
lipstick or a few of their lipsticks and
then I just never tried out and then if
it's just something that's out of my
comfort zone really sometimes I just
forget to try it all together so I'm
gonna challenge myself really quick and
find a lipstick I've never tried before
and this huge pile of lipstick I
actually have not tried these these are
the Charlotte Tilbury liquid lipsticks
so maybe I can try one of these
ooh I definitely haven't ever tried this
one this one I got for free from
colour-pop because it was like an extra
in my box for some reason let's just try
it it'll be fun it'll be fun
okay so I'm going to try this one first
from colour-pop this is I think from the
Hello Kitty collection because it has a
little Hello Kitty's all over it
this is called LOC diary and I don't
know
guys can tell but I'm very very pale
right now like this is the palest my
skin yes like I have not been in this
Sun I feel like in over a year but I
usually self tan and I just haven't in
like over a month so I'm trying to
figure out like what things look good
with my pale skin it's kind of difficult
and I feel like this isn't this might
look good but wolsey look how pigmented
they are um you know it's weird I don't
hate it and I thought it was graded so
that's the good part about trying things
that you're too scared to try sometimes
because sometimes you end up actually
liking it let me know what you guys
think about this color for you for me in
general do you like these like fuchsia
purpley shades I feel like it makes your
teeth look really light I'll just swatch
this one for you on my hand since I
didn't get to try it this is the
Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood lips in the
shade too bad I'm bad I thought said too
bad so sad but it said too bad I'm mad
okay
but I'll show you what it looks like
this is more like you know my shade
every single day so while we're in my
filming room I guess you can already
tell there's a huge difference if you
watched our house tour already and we
actually filmed the process of ripping
the wallpaper out of this room and
painting it white but I should just show
you guys around a little bit because I
haven't fully decorated yet I thought I
would show you guys a little tip that I
just kind of made up so if I just had
put this in the basket it would have
been it would have looked like this like
it would have been way too low for this
so if you just put like a little towel
or pillow in your basket and then you
place your potted plant in there
you can kind of just see the whole plant
better and like you would never know and
this was actually silver in her old
house and Marx's dad helped me paint
this white so it's thinking about maybe
putting it in here but also maybe in the
kitchen they just put some stuff in this
basket I have a little journal my oils
book and then like a little planner in
here and I put in my Polaroid and I
think I might put this up here I think
that that is cute and then I also have
these two things that I wanted to hang
up in here but I also don't know if I'm
gonna have enough room I have my little
behind sign and this thing that I got
from urban but who knows if it's gonna
even fit to be honest sighs I forgot to
update you on the biggest thing can't be
the food mrs. baby Bing I have a
question
could I get your family pigs we're gonna
show you what happens when she's eating
her tail start as a coating when you get
close and then you can go like saying
Cody about to be here and I just started
the shrimp tacos and I don't think I can
go through the entire process of it just
because it might take forever there
actually might be here um but just you
just need some shrimp
here's my shrimp and some onions some
tomato oh I'll just put the recipe down
below that's a good idea
you'll never guess what time it is right
now it's 4:20 8:00 in the morning
we've just been talking to our friend
who's in town pretty much all night so
I'm so tired we had amazing shrimp tacos
I don't even know if I'm making sense
right now cuz that's how dead I am but I
love you guys I hope that you enjoyed
