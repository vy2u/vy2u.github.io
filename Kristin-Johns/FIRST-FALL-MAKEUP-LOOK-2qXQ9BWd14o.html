pretty much here I don't know what neck
fall technically starts but to me fall
starts on September 1st so we're in fall
right now and I'm so excited to be
showing you guys this makeup look I am
also very excited because I have
partnered with Sephora collection to
show you guys how to get this look I
used all of their brand new amazing
products and I love how this look turned
out I seriously love it and I think I'm
going to be wearing this makeup look
every single day this fall and if you
guys recreate this look make sure to tag
me so I can see your pictures and
hashtag Sephora collection and hash tag
Beauty uncomplicated so I can see all
your posts and if you want to see how I
get this makeup look then just keep
watching ok so I don't know if you guys
can tell or not but I'm actually filming
for the first time in my beauty room
which was supposed to be the room that I
filmed in all the time but I've just now
kind of filled it up so it's not super
echoey so I'm so happy to be filming in
here for this fall makeup look and the
first thing I'm going to be using today
is the beauty amplifier afterglow primer
and Luminizer so this is gonna give your
skin a really pretty glowy look and also
get your skin prepared for your
foundation and also in the fall I still
like to keep my skin super bright and
like natural looking so it's not super
matte since it's usually colder in the
fall so I still like using more of a
luminous primer and this one is really
good for that and now I'm going to be
using it via make no mistake foundation
stick I am in the shade o 7 maple and I
just love foundation sticks they're so
great for on-the-go
and also they usually have very good
coverage this one has really good
coverage and they're just so easy to use
and just like so fast and I actually
like blending in stick foundations with
a brush better than like a sponge so I'm
going to be using this Sephora 202
multitasker face brush and it just looks
like this it's just a really nice like a
buffing brush
and I'm just gonna buff that in all over
my skin and another thing that I really
like about stick foundations is how you
can kind of really target the area that
you need the most coverage in and if
you're done blending and then you see an
area that you need more of you can just
whack on a tiny bit more and I just
think that's really nice about stick
foundations so here's what the
foundation looks like all blended out I
would say this would be a great
foundation for people who have a more
normal or oily skin because it is more
of a matte look so it's good to have
that luminous primer underneath it
they're like a perfect match for each
other and then for concealer today I'm
going to be taking the make no mistake
high coverage concealer and I only need
a tiny tiny bit of this because it is
super full coverage so I literally take
a tiny tiny dot and I'm just gonna put
that underneath my eyes of course you
can put it anywhere that you need a
little bit of extra coverage and then
I'm gonna use the other side of my
foundation brush it's just like a little
bit of a smaller brush and I'm just
gonna blend that out and as you can see
this brighten my under eyes so much and
I actually use two shades lighter of my
foundation for my concealer just to make
sure it's really bright underneath my
eyes so now I'm just setting my face
with a tiny bit of powder I'm using the
sephora 201 powder and a blush brush and
for bronzer today I'm going to be using
at the Sephora collection bronzer in the
shade Los Cabos it's a really pretty
it's like a perfect mix between a cool
tone and warm tone so you can still
definitely contour with this if you
would want to but I think I'm gonna do
just more of like a bronzy all-over look
with this today so I'm just gonna be
taking it on that same Sephora
powder brush and that's what I love
about everything in the Sephora
collection everything is just so user
friendly nothing blends weird everything
is just super easy to work with and
that's what I love because there's
nothing more frustrating than using
makeup products that take forever to
blend out and then some
they work sometimes they don't I found
with all these products they're just
super easy to use and for blush today
I'm so excited because I have a bunch of
options in here this is the Sephora
collection blush palette it comes with
all of these really pretty shades right
here I think I might actually mix these
two together so it's like pinky and ma
vie at the same time and I'm gonna be
using this little shape and sculpt 204
brush and this brush is really good for
blush I'm just gonna go between these
two little boo boo and another thing
that I've been doing lately is I've been
taking my blush brush I don't know if
this is technically it's something
you're not supposed to do but I put a
little bit on my nose just to kind of
give my face kind of like a uniform
all-over flushed look perfect for fall
but I've been doing that for a while I
don't know if it makes a huge difference
but it's just like a habit that I've
gotten into okay now for everybody's
favorite part I'm gonna be highlighting
my face in the shade dawn and I'm gonna
be taking on the other side of the blush
brush and I'm gonna be using this to
highlight Wow okay now it's time for the
most exciting part of this whole makeup
look it is time for the eyes so I'm
gonna assume you guys in and show you at
the palette that I'm gonna be using
because it's so pretty
it is the Sephora Pro palette it's huge
and it's heavy like it feels so nice and
I'm gonna be using the warm tone palette
today are you ready and I also wanted to
show you guys because they have a cool
tone palette as well and it's equally as
beautiful like look at those colors what
its first shade that I'm gonna be
grabbing is the shade out it's this one
right here it's a little bit darker and
then a white um but it's still light
enough so you can use it kind of as your
base color I'm going to be putting that
all over my lids just as a nice base for
our transition color today there's so
many different ones to choose from it's
really
pick I think I'm just gonna go with this
medium brown color this one is called
saddle and I'm gonna run that through my
crease just just so all other shades
that I put down are gonna blend way
easier okay now I'm using the shade
brick which is this stunning like what
even is this this is just the prettiest
like raspberry perfect fall color ever
and I'm going to be doing a kind of like
a halo eye shadow look so I'm going to
be putting that brick shade on the inner
corner in the outer corner and leaving
the middles open so then at the end I'm
going to put a really bright shade then
I'm just gonna press that into my inner
and outer corners so you can kind of see
how I left the middle part of my eye
empty I'm going to do the exact same
thing to the other eye and I'll be right
back
now that I look a little crazy I'm gonna
be taking this shade right here which is
called copper it's a really pretty gold
color oh so soft and I'm just gonna be
using my finger to put that in the
middle like sandwiched in between the
burgundy color now it's time to blend
all of these shades together like all of
the edges so I'm just gonna take that
tiny crease brush and really just mesh
them all together so it doesn't look
like there's any harsh lines so my eyes
are pretty much done at least the top
I'm gonna do at the bottom after I do my
eyeliner and I'm gonna go do that
off-camera really quick and I'll be
right back
brows and liner or on but now I'm gonna
be putting on mascara this is the lash
craft big volume mascara this is what it
looks like
and I'm just gonna be putting a ton of
mascara on okay and then really quickly
it's for at the bottom lash line I'm
taking that same shade like that mane
really pretty pink shade underneath all
along my lashes and then on my inner
corner I'm going to take that gold shade
that we put in the center of our eyelid
and putting that right on the inner
corner okay guys I'm really torn on
whether I should put on false lashes or
just let my natural lashes live their
own little lives but
I don't know I don't know I wish you
guys get telling what to do through the
screen but definitely if you're
recreating this look you can add false
lashes if you want and to finish off the
look I'm going to be using the Sephora
collection cream lip stain and this one
is in the shade at 23 this is a
beautiful shade I love this one this is
like you guys know like my perfect kind
of lip color and the final final thing
for this makeup look is some setting
spray this is the Sephora collection
beauty amplifier setting spray okay guys
this is the finished fall makeup look I
really hope that you guys liked it I
think it turned out so pretty and all of
the products that I used every single
one of them can be found at Sephora and
