expecting it to film but I was doing a
livestream on Instagram and I asked you
guys if you wanted to see this video and
all of you said yes you would really
like to see this type of video so I just
decided I'm just gonna film this video
and put it up even though my hair has
been in a bun for the past three days
and it doesn't look the best I still
wanted to film this video for y'all
because I leave to go to Florida
tomorrow for six days and I'm just going
to be spending time with my family so
I'm not really gonna have time to film
so anyways I've been wanting to film
this type of video for a while I've
accumulated a bunch of things that I
wanted to show you guys from a ton of
different places I loved workout clothes
I think a cute work outfit can really
inspire you to work out more than just
like a boring old t-shirt so I wanted to
show you some of the things that I've
picked up the past few weeks I would say
this all the stuff is it within the past
month month and a half maybe I'll start
with this because I just love this so
much this is from Urban Outfitters but
it's Calvin Klein brand it's just this
sports bra but it has cap sleeves it's
super soft I don't know why it's looking
all reflective on the screen but it's
super soft and for someone who doesn't
need a ton of support with your sports
bras I would say this is perfect for you
and this would just be something that I
would wear on like a chill workout not
something super like jumping around and
stuff but this is nice for like going on
a a walk with markets or even like a
spin class or something where you're not
like jumping around and running this is
perfect for that it looks really cute on
by the way I'm going to be trying
everything on for you guys so you can
see what it looks like I also got this
from urban and this has become my new
favorite workout shirt I worn this so
many times and I just got it so recently
I wear this just by itself without a
sports bra and it's just so cute and the
back is dipped down like
back and I love this this was on sale on
I hope they still have it because I
really really recommend this to you guys
because it is so comfy if they have this
in more colors I would buy this in every
single color it's just perfect
okay I think that's every oh no I got
one more thing from Urban Outfitters
this was also on sale and this is kind
of strange
it's a turtleneck cutoff sleeve shirt
and it has this tie in the back this
little knot and I just thought this was
very unique looking the thing that this
would be horrible for is doing crunches
because this was just jab into your back
but this is just kind of like athleisure
I guess I would say the next thing I'll
mention is t.j.maxx because I am in love
with t.j.maxx and I am in love with
their workout clothes selection I have
bought in some my favorite workout
clothes all-time from TJ Maxx and
they're always at such a good price so
these first ones are my most recent
purchase and this is from the brand
Orfeo sole I got these in an extra small
but they're just these olive green color
and they just fit so nicely
they are high-waisted which I love I
hate workout pants that are below my
hips I just feel like oh they're less
flattering and easier to fall down so I
love high-waisted these are high waisted
and they go all the way down to your
ankles
and I have another pair of workout
leggings from TJ Maxx but these are
actually from three people I have never
seen workout things from three people at
t.j.maxx so when I saw this I was like
best day ever cuz they're like my two
favorite places I got these in an extra
small you guys have probably seen
pictures of workout leggings like this
floating around the internet but they
have this kind of cool front it's kind
of like splits at like a little tube
right there well I was the worst
description ever these are actually
cropped at the bottom and
they have these ties that you wrap
around your leg and it looks like those
ballerina leggings and these were really
really really discounted but they were
still a little bit more expensive and
then t.j.maxx is usually I think these
were $30 but I thought they were worth
it just since they are free people and
they are so unique and it's just like I
gotta get those they're so durable these
are adorable to wear it to yoga class
the last thing from TJ Maxx is this
sports bra this is from the brand MGP
and this is a double layered sports bra
so it has this Mavi purple color
underneath it with the gray on top this
would be a perfect sports bra for
someone who really needs support while
working out because it has kind of like
that
double-double sports bra act with it
only just being in one sports bra this
next outfit is a little bit random
because I didn't actually purchase it
myself but I went to this Puma yoga
event and somewhere in LA and they gave
us this gift bag and inside of it was
this Puma outfit and I actually ended up
loving this outfit so the first thing is
this sports bra
it has rose gold letters on it that's a
Puma and it's just a really basic sports
bra and then the pants are what I love
so much this is what they look like they
have this cool rose gold twisty turny
pattern all down them and then they have
the Puma yoke the Puma yoga the Puma
logo at the bottom oh I actually forgot
I got something else from Urban
Outfitters and they're these tennis
shoes they look like this I wore these
in a picture on a recent Instagram I
post and I got a lot of questions on
them these are Nike Ayres says it right
there that's how I know but I just love
white tennis shoes even though they get
dirty so fast I also got a pair of
Adidas leggings recently these are so
cool I think this is from a specific
collection but I'm just not sure they
have this really interesting like I
don't even know this pad
it's just so pretty and they're just
basic black they have the adidas logo
right there and then they go all the way
down to your ankles I haven't worn them
yet but I'm so excited - okay I have two
things from Under Armour I needed some
new workout shorts because as you can
see I have a ton of work out leggings
but I don't have very many shorts and
they're just pump pump pump
I just utter it so much these are just
plain black workout shorts I like these
because they're simple and I also got
some gray cotton ones these are a lot
different like these don't have the
built-in underwear or anything they have
a pocket which is nice and they're just
gray and white and say Under Armour
around the band the last place that I
got some new workout clothes it's called
albion fit I actually just did an
Instagram post in these they're so cute
so I got these pants I think they're
called
the bloom collection but they're pink
and then they have white mesh around
them and then the sports bra has the
same pattern and it's cross cross back
and I also got two other pair of workout
pants that I have oh I have one one but
I haven't one of these yet so these
still have the tag on them they're just
black with flowers all down them these
have more of a spandexy feeling to them
but they still feel really nice quality
and they are high-waisted as well and
then this last pair might be my favorite
these are so cute I love these these are
the Antiqua leggings
by I'll be on fit oh by the way
everything in this haul is pretty much
an extra small I wear an extra small and
workout stuff usually um so yeah these
are an extra small so those are all of
the clothing items that I've gotten
recently to workout in I hope that you
guys like this video and maybe it gave
you some inspiration for cute work
outfits to wear so if you guys did like
