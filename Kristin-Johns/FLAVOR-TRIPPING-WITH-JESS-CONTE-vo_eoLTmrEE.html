friend Conte I'm sure all of you guys
know her today we are doing the flavor
trip wait food tripping flavor tripping
test basically I ordered these pills
from Amazon and they're called miracle
berries you let it dissolve all over
your tongue and then it changes all of
the sour things and tart things and to
sweet things so sorry crazy well wait
before we start did have you tasted all
this what's this pomegranate seeds let
me check
it's like corn but like a different it's
like fruit corn mm-hmm so you love this
should we just take our kills ya know
I've never meet you kind of weird like
is this healthy I know what's actually
inside this it's like a real berry that
grows in Taiwan they said to let it
dissolve like put it all over your
tongue like okay in the back and get all
your taste buds is yours dissolving
yours isn't it wait let me see
Oh same same way isn't it weird how it
doesn't have very much information I
know it's so let's get so big it's just
like a make your own experiences I think
I just like it's not my house anymore
should we go let's start with a bang Oh
baby
like should we start with something
crazy like the lemon yeah you know I
cannot eat lemons straight can you know
like there then people can I cannot so
if you can now it really is miracle
berries
what is this meant to taste like did it
meet it's like supposed to taste like
eliminators I feel like it's not gonna
work are you having babies do one no
like sugar it's almost like overly sweet
but you still get the lemon like all in
the backyard you know what that is
totally weird yeah
tang is still there so women was it what
should we try pomegranates yeah which we
already like regularly so let's see if K
just tastes sweet I'm just gonna take a
bunch okay oh my gosh all of the
sourness is gone I cannot focus your
eyes and eat it and it's like you're
eating a cold come on or something
you're still right let's try these okay
yeah cuz we already know wheat neither
rest like these you don't like them
either they're too strong okay all right
look this tastes the same right wait no
really I hate something many good chips
but I'm eating like yeah you look so it
must have really changed it looks good
you can't pinpoint mm-hmm it's still
like a little vinegary I'm bad at
explaining good we try a strawberry
mm-hmm I love me too
it tastes like the most perfect ripe
strawberry we can you know when you get
those really good sweet strawberries
that's what it tastes like
sir good you smell it's gonna be us
eating food delicious we haven't had
anything bad yet but a trial on this is
a line right off our lime tree Oh
oh my gosh huh but the in taste is kind
of sweet I wouldn't take a bite neither
this makes it even more Salwa all right
maybe we just have very sour limes on
our tree that's a very sound yeah take a
little bit okay maybe you're big it
doesn't work it doesn't work on uh
what I will say is like the end is kind
of more sweet mm-hmm but in the very
like initial taste is like I'm like not
wanting to eat this manna
do you like the money I do but like not
right now um but I'm gonna taste it I'm
just gonna bite into Oh
and then I'll bite mmm one and you'll
like that really mm-hmm
maybe I'm letting it fall into your
hands
it's like a most subtle to murder that's
exactly right
last but not least cream cheese
it's weirdy cream cheese but yeah you
guys like it what does this meant to
taste like cheesecake online they said
how are we gonna
I forgot this food that's a lot I'm just
gonna like this one
smell it it's like it smells weird right
so that's a lot okay that works
whoa that does taste like cheese cakes I
think this is the one that worked the
most this is the one that changed
something from being weird by itself to
very delicious by itself just show
berries are the best mmm together oh
that tastes so good Miley's looking at
himself you'll probably see that in the
video him just like looking he's just
exploring my rhythm that tastes very
good
I could eat so much of this that's the
dangerous thing online they said people
end up feeling really sick after cuz
they eat so many random things if you
guys try this try it with cream cheese
and strawberries mm-hmm yes that's our
number one recommendation
which one worked the least you think
they'll why am i tried one more lip huh
well I hope you guys enjoyed us trying
all these weird foods let me just tell
you guys oh no dude well we did a video
on her channel a while ago the mouth
guard challenge and ever since then
we've been wanting to do this video on
my channel it's been months yeah it's
just so long cuz whenever we want to
hang out we don't necessarily want to
film or we just the schedules don't work
out and we're really bad textures we're
both the worst text is if you know us in
real life you know we'll get back a
couple days away yeah so if you guys
want to see the video that we did on
Jesse's channel away a little bit down
below and I'll also link Jess's all for
socials for YouTube Instagram I'll weak
