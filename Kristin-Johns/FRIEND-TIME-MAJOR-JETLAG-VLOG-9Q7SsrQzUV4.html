you want to go to the park what do you
want to go to the park the boys of the
family are my son
hey guys so I had a very relaxing
morning um I love kind of jet-lagged
because I've been waking up at like 6:00
every single morning and I feel like I
just get so much more done in the day so
this morning has been great and I just
did my makeup and I tried to match my
lipstick to this orange stripe I think I
did pretty good we just got home a few
days ago from our trip if you haven't
seen our vlogs from the trip yet I will
link them down below I don't know for
sure if we'll have posted the Greece
vlog yet on our channel but but I know
for sure that we've posted the London
vlog on our channel already so I'll link
that below if you want to see all of our
adventures but it feels really good to
be home I am a little bit sick I don't
know if you can hear my voice but it's
like my throat is on fire I don't even
know how that's sick I think I got sick
on the plane coming home because it was
a long flight so my throat is like help
me I do have something fun to show you
guys while I was gone I got three
packages in the mail
and I put them in here so I could wait
to show you guys I'll set you guys over
here and I'll show you okay so this is
what came in the mail I got some boxes
from thredUP
and I'm so excited to show you guys
these and open these because I haven't
opened them yet and looked at them and
I'm very excited and thread up is a huge
online through store they have amazing
things they have like every single
different brand of clothing you could
ever want and I love their shopping in
regular thrift stores but thredUP has
made me like a little bit spoiled and I
just find it way easier to surf shop
online because you don't have to like
drive anywhere you don't have to park
you don't think I actually go through
things you can just scroll and it's
really nice so the first thing that I
got is a sweater this is from the brand
honey punch so it's just a big oversized
knit sweater I'll be trying on all these
things by the way so I can show you how
they fit every time I'm getting
I always am just drawn to putting on a
big sweater and no matter if it's hot
outside if it's freezing outside I just
want a big sweater so I'm fine with
getting a ton of big sweaters because I
seriously put all of my sweaters to use
I feel like I just said sweater eighty
times the estimated retail price of this
sweater it was $60 and I got it for $15
I also got some Levi's jeans and I
really like these because of the color
of them they're like this cool like gray
like what's this called like distressed
color is kind of like a faded gray and I
can't even believe how much of his
steelies were the estimated retail price
for these was $60 and I got them for $10
and nine nine cents for a pair of Levi's
jeans what's next what's next
oh I forgot about these okay I really
should have had these for Greece because
these would have been perfect these are
white linen like wide leg pants you
can't really tell what they look like on
the camera but I'll definitely try them
on um I got these because I think that
white linen pants are so pretty with
like a little crop top like more of like
a bold color crop top and then these I
think that'd be really cute and the
estimated retail price of these were $45
and I got them for $13 another great
deal oh I'm so excited about this one
okay this looks adorable I've never
heard this brand
11150 it says wait this is from
Anthropologie originally it still has
the tag on from Anthropologie and it
said 138 dollars so this was obviously a
hundred and thirty-eight dollars at once
how much do I get this for $34 but this
is what it looks like it's an off the
shoulder dress and it ties in the front
next thing I got are these shorts and
these are from the oh these are from
Anthropologie as well I didn't even
realize that and I also really liked the
length of these
I feel like they're gonna look really
cute so let's see how much they wear the
estimated retail price for these was 48
dollars and I got them for $13
I hope these fit they're an extra-small
they look a little like oversize but I
think I can make it work
the very last thing but not the very
least thing very most almost probably
most important thing oh okay
it is this sweater it is a turtleneck
big slouchy sweater it's kind of like
the first one but this one is a
turtleneck instead of a v-neck and it's
a little bit of a lighter gram as you
can see and the brand of this one is
leaf and I never heard of that brand
before but it loved this sweater
an estimated retail price of this one
was a hundred and nineteen dollars so
this must be a very fancy brand and I
got it for $24.99 so that is everything
that I got from thredUP
and very exciting thredUP is giving it
you guys 25% off of your first order all
you have to do is click the link it down
below in my description box and use the
code of kristin 25 please send me
pictures of the cute things that you get
because I feel like anytime I get cute
things from the thrift store it feels
like a treasure that I get and I'm so
excited to share it with you guys so if
you guys get anything cute please send
me tons of pictures because I love
seeing that kind of stuff I just decided
to stay in this dress because it's
really comfortable I think I actually
still have to tag on it so I'll have to
take that off but um I wanted to show
you guys my all-time favorite treat
ever it's called a flake and I also love
I think they're called a whirl or a
twirl or a whisper something like that
but this is my favorite candy ever and I
got it in the London Heathrow Airport
and I'm like savoring it I had a whisper
in here but I think that someone ate it
which I'd be very bad I also show you
these I'm just showing you all of the
unhealthy things but I just got these at
they're called spicy cheese crunchies
these are an exact replica of Hot
Cheetos and they don't have like the
horrible horrible ingredients that Hot
Cheetos have like hot cheetos has like
straight-up chemicals in it but this
doesn't end there from Trader Joe's and
I could eat these all day I just got
them I think two days ago and I'm almost
done with the whole bag if you love hot
cheetos I'm telling you it tastes the
exact same do you agree
they're dangerous they're really
dangerous it's the middle of the day
it's like two o'clock and provide go to
the movies with some of our friends wish
I don't even know what's happening until
like 20 minutes ago so I'm gonna put on
my sweater because I always get freezing
so I'm gonna change real quick now we
gotta leave so I think we're running
late to the movies
we've never be seen at the movies
without snacks in my purse also no how
about to see people you know how when
you don't wear deodorant and then it
kind of makes you seem like a more rude
person because you like don't want to
hug people or like be too close to them
so then you just look like standoffish
but really you just don't want them to
smell your armpit
it looks so good I'm gonna get a haircut
I'm gonna chop it all off
like this look this is how it look with
your hair
okay we're getting forced to go see Star
doors it's like a girls day out but with
the boy so we're not going to do what we
really wanted yeah wait do any of you I
like and trying to is this yes a bit
flexi is going to give me better
eyebrows right now we're gonna test out
and see I've used this once but this is
my favorite ever brow product it's
called gimme brow what color did you get
I got a gave you four point five okay
let's try it
it's Vani Oh volume you mom you a
volumizing fiber gel this is how I do
you want me just yours how I do mine
yeah okay yeah show see so see how this
one like see how they go out of the
place and go kind of down like that yeah
when you put this on it stops it and
just gives you a little like lift you
know I think that's my color let me see
I really like it you see you only have
to put a little bit over when you fill
in and then right here you go my gift so
what were your feelings about Star Wars
I really liked it really yeah that was
much better than the last
hi it's not personally a fan of Star
Wars because I just don't know enough
about it I feel it and I really liked it
I think it was just easy to understand I
feel like that's what Disney did to it
they just made it like easy to digest
that's well I like that they didn't have
all these crazy characters another a
story B story C story that's what Star
Wars usually does but this was just like
you got your four main characters and
that was it like they never cut away to
like an alternate thing you don't have
to bring me that you don't have to bring
me anything
now that we're home I got to show you
guys something very sad that happened
while we were gone it's hard to admit
that this happened guys but I'm gonna
show you one of my favorite plants has
officially died when I was gone look how
sad oh this is the update to the pool
this is what it looks like so far there
you go so this is all new all this is
just done today
yeah it's curing hmm that's gonna be yes
Marcus is still out there looking at the
pool I'm about to see something really
glamorous and I don't know if you guys
are ready because it's really glamorous
I'm going to be doing some laundry I
actually don't even know if I've ever
shown you guys our laundry room I'll
show it to you it's not very organized
right now but this is our little laundry
room it has a little skylight which I
love and it's just big enough to do the
job remember I showed you guys this
swimsuit in my last little like haul I
actually wore it in Greece and it was
very calm thank you okay I'm gonna bring
this stuff in and fold it now
this is the best way to fold a blanket
this is the proper way long side fold
like this then fold once more
shake out so there's no creases then
once then once that's how you get the
perfect towel fold and if you do any
other way
I'm gonna have to redo it for you it's
like 9 o'clock at night now and I'm
starting to feel so sick again I thought
I was feeling better
kind of like earlier I mean I don't know
I'm saying that I don't know I just feel
really really sick that's just one of
the things I feel like when you travel
it's just way more easy to get sick for
some reason by like this time at night I
like cannot keep my eyes open anymore
which kind of stink cuz usually I'm good
like I usually stay up to like 2:00 in
the morning like fine um but I've just
been a grandma and I have to go to sleep
so early but before I end this vlog I
wanted to tell you guys about this book
that I have been reading because I
always liked it in my vlogs like some
type of encouragement for you and
something that has seriously been like
oh hello honey this is my daughter the
best ever
this is what it looks like basically
what I wanted to say that I really took
away from one of the chapters that I
read was that you're never running out
of time because God's timing is perfect
and she put this first in which I don't
think I had ever heard before if I had I
had
really thought about it it's Philippians
1:6 and it says being confident of this
that he who began a good work in you
will carry it on to completion and how
reassuring is that like God has already
started an amazing life for you an
amazing work in your heart and he has
promised that he will finish out what he
has planned for your life you definitely
don't have to worry about running out of
time or that you haven't done enough in
this period of time that you had set for
yourself so I just want to tell you guys
that because that was super encouraging
for me and I was like a little bit mind
blown but I really hope that you guys
enjoyed today's vlog you do like this
