in Florida I don't know if you guys
remember my old room I used to film in
here all the time
but since I'm home I thought it was the
perfect opportunity to do this video
that I've been seeing going around it's
called doing my makeup with my mom's
makeup bag the first person that I saw
do this was nikkietutorials and I'm sure
other people have done it since then but
I just thought this video was so sweet
and honestly this video it would not be
as fun if I didn't actually have my mom
in it so everyone welcome my mom you've
been on my channel before yes I have
are you happy oh so happy okay mom so
just walk me through your everyday what
you do okay on your face this is what I
did here's four make it back she packed
for me hmm
okay I use this this no I'm gonna do I
didn't you know I've used it for two
weeks and I love it I really did why do
you like it I just think it makes your
makeup pillow better and then I take
this really I love it
Too Faced peach perfect in the shade
nude did I give you this no you wet it
first or you do not dampen it yes
I can't let me go to infinite hurry up
okay okay and I put it on my finger on
your finger mm-hmm okay
why are you on your finger I put it on
this finger I don't know why I just do
did I put too much more than you oh okay
so she uses two Faced Born This Way
concealer in medium tan mhm
remember the concealer you always used
when I was growing up Mac Mac in 25
Matthew in 20 way W 20 you know what
have Moisture Surge or select moisture
back there that's the concealer I grew
and it's the best it really is good now
I've always told me to put my blush
powder I have never told you to do now
think of a sling I think it's wrong but
I've been up at my blush on you put your
blush straight on top of your foundation
that's what I thought I'm supposed to do
yeah yep okay that's what I did look at
this yeah well they don't have fun of me
under you is this about as much as you
do
mm-hmm okay now what let me say yeah
that's pretty this is the Paul and Joe
translucent powder I did a video about
this in college and then I gave it to
you and I loved it so you you don't use
this puppy nut she uses it with this
brush you get it everywhere
well you supposed to ding ding ding
thank you so you don't use bronzer mMmmm
no more facing she uses the Urban Decay
Naked basics it's so pretty mom
ok which one is what what do you think
well what do you do for that and that
together I do this okay you rub the
metal pan well I'm getting on you just
rub your knees sure and now what then I
take this I should have bet and I think
then you're done no not gonna say yeah
but did I take this smack so you'd go
for a very natural island yes and you
like using Matt's not shimmers right yes
acting here and then we got back back in
the urban decay and I go to my Mac brush
266 that's the line I use everyday and
then I take it and I dip dip dip and
then I'm in the black yeah and then do
it a smoky not not a straight line but
like all on your upper left uh yeah
upper lashline yeah yeah yeah but then
one and then it gets thicker as you get
help yeah yep yep that looks real good
real good now doing underneath with
black yep but very like she uses Milani
brow fix brow kit yeah that's not all
because I use that too okay but she
starts with this mm-hmm
which color do you okay I'm gonna use
this little bro mm-hmm I take it my tap
tap tap both of my tap tap tap tap tap
okay so basically this is a tap tap tap
tap yeah yeah and then it kind of mixes
the two colors and they'll be a perfect
color for my brows
[Laughter]
this is truly what you do why do I look
so weird
okay these are much of lipsticks that I
love so much okay so I'm scared
it's covergirl and it has no name on it
but you know why I get more compliments
when I wear this lipstick than any other
lipstick I've never worn in my entire
life and I found it in my fishing tackle
box and I think it's one of my dear
friend Karen Peters because every time I
wear it she's like what that lipstick
what's the minimum and I say hmm I don't
know
but this shape it was Karen's lipstick
she did that shape and it's a little bit
shiny yeah that's why I put this over it
to make a not so shiny okay yeah
it's really pretty pretty pretty so
shimmery yeah no but then put this over
it this won't be so shimmery this is in
uh verbena this is from Mike that's a
really pretty color I don't know why you
want to cover it up no I'm never coming
up again yeah this just makes it a
little less shimmer yeah yeah which is
good now you for you need to go get your
mascara yeah I know
okay I'll go to get a mascara and then
we'll do this last part this is the Too
Faced dark chocolate Soleil and you have
to use this a lot I don't do it up there
oh you want to blend it with this now I
do mom how old is that mascara is brand
spanking new no I don't even think they
make this mascara anymore no I just
bought it target three days ago probably
about three months ago a baleen a legal
length mm-hmm and now for this this is
important because this will just
brighten your whole face up look you
take this and just do it right here
this mom putting concealer over powder I
know is not a good thing I do think what
this is doing my makeup just exactly how
my mom does it how do you think it looks
I think it looks really good if I wear
my makeup like this that lipstick up
with dye
okay guys so I hope that you enjoyed
this video thanks mom for being on my
channel and if you like this video
