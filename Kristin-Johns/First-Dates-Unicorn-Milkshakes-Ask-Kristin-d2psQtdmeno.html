your questions that you sent me on
Instagram and I love these type of
videos because I really feel like you
guys can get to know me better and also
I love when you guys answer the
questions too so I am really excited for
this video first how was your guys's
Halloween what did you dress up as you
guys send me some pictures on Twitter or
snapchat or something like that I would
love to see what you guys were for
Halloween I had a really good Halloween
I hope that you guys did Halloween is a
pretty fun time also I have to tell
y'all you know how in my last video I
was asking you guys if you would like me
to open my own p.o box well a lot of you
guys said yes and that you would love
for us to write each other actually did
that about a week ago and I've already
received three letters from you guys and
I wrote you guys back today I just put
them in the mailbox you ever want to
write me a letter or anything like that
I would love to write you back because I
just think that writing letters is such
a fun and special thing that I think we
don't really do enough anymore so now we
can get started on answering your
questions let's see here the first
question is what is my favorite snack
and drink for the Fall and that is a
hard one I think my favorite snack of
the fall I really know that the snack
but it's a dessert and it's pumpkin pie
and I love pumpkin pie so much it's
really one of my favorite desserts of
all time and so that would have to be my
favorite dessert for the Fall and my
favorite drink for the fall is probably
just hot chocolate with a lot of whipped
cream on top the next question is if
there was a unicorn milkshake how do you
think it would taste that's a very
unique question I think the unicorn
milkshake would taste very sweet but
first ah
there's no unicorns harmed in the making
of this milkshake that's the number one
deal-breaker if there is I'm not even
try that unicorn milkshake sweet sparkly
and it would look like a rainbow that's
what my unicorn milkshake would look
like it tastes like one says can you say
socks with sandals in an English accent
and I am so bad at accents guys socks
with sandals no that's horrible
it was my best effort and that problem
was horrible so don't touch me please
what was your first date with Marcus and
was it awkward my first date with Marcus
we went to dinner he took me dinner and
that biscuit I think he wants to come in
here one moment he took me to dinner and
then we went to my friend's house and
played some games like catchphrase and
then we literally went back to my dorm
and stayed up talking to like five in
the morning and the next day I was like
oh my gosh so tired but it was never
awkward so yeah our first date was
really fun I really liked it what kind
of music do I listen to I love pretty
much all types of music except for um
out flow like when they're screaming or
if it's like really like rah rah rah rah
rah like rock music I think don't really
like rock music folk music I love um
country music Christian music I really
love every type of music so that's a
tough question but pretty much anything
that doesn't sound scary if you could
pick one place to live on earth or
beyond where would it be well I would
not choose beyond because space really
freaks me out if I could choose to live
anywhere on earth it'd probably be TV
who wouldn't want to live in teeny it's
the most beautiful how do I stay focused
during school and not procrastinate and
that's funny because I am the biggest
procrastinator of all time I always wait
till night for to turn it anything do
any project do any homework study yeah
it's pretty bad I would have to say I do
not have any good advice for how not to
procrastinate I sleep with any stuffed
animals at night yes I do it's right
there
his name is bear me this actually gave
him to me on my night 19th birthday so
over a year ago and I sleep with him at
night and she is so nice and I sleep
with him like this okay so my lights had
actually died so I had to just go and
charge them really quick so I'm sorry if
the lighting changed a little bit
somebody asked if I ever had braces and
I did have braces I had them from fifth
grade until the summer of eighth grade
so that's like fixham I had them for
four years and it was not a fun
experience one of you guys asked me how
biscuit is doing and he's doing great
out know if he's in the camera shot
right now but he's laying right next to
me um let me just tell you guys biscuit
is going through a real phase he is kind
of acting like a real punk lately but
I'm actually getting him fixed this week
so maybe he will start acting a little
bit less crazy he's still the cutest cat
in the whole world but I'll just show
you an example oh he's gone he cheering
us on that thing
oh there he is
okay guys I hope that you enjoyed this
video and please answer any of the
questions that you want down below in
the comment section and I would love
that don't forget to like this video and
subscribe to see my next ones and I hope
you guys have a great rest of your week
