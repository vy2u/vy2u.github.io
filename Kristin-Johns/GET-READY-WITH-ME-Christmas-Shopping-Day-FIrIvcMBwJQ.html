ready for the day with you and I'm also
going to be including uh something a
little bit different I am gonna be
getting ready with a bunch of the stuff
that came in this season's fact fun box
so this is the winter box and I'm gonna
be incorporating a bunch of the products
from this box into my get ready routine
so we'll see how that goes I'm gonna try
to use as many of the items as possible
and if you guys don't know what
fabfitfun is I've pretty much been
getting fat fun boxes for the past I
think it's been officially two years now
so I'm pretty much a fabfitfun expert
and fact that fun is a seasonal
subscription box and you get all
full-size products of anything from
beauty to accessories to Fitness things
so it's a really great subscription it's
$49.99 per box and I've been trying out
new ways to show you guys the things in
the box just so it's not just a regular
unboxing like last season's box I did
kind of like a vlog where I showed you
guys amazing the products about the day
and then today I'm gonna be it just
trying them out while I get ready so oh
the first thing that I am already using
is this mug that came in the box it says
coming in hot and it's just a really
cute little mug and these mugs retail
for $16 I got my blueberry tea and I'm
ready to get ready okay so I'm just
gonna be applying my foundation like
regular because I didn't get a
foundation in the box so I'm gonna be
also showing you guys just the regular
products that I'm gonna be using today
to get ready and then I'm just gonna put
on my Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
blendy blendy I need y'all's opinion
what do you believe in fake Christmas
trees or a real Christmas tree I am a
real Christmas tree a hundred percent
girl I understand the need for fake tree
sometimes but if I have a choice I will
always always choose a real Christmas
tree there's just something so special
about them it would be a sad
Christmas for me we had a fake tree so
even though we're probably going out of
town before Christmas like we're
probably gonna go back to Florida I'm
like Marcus
we still need a real tree even though
it's gonna die while we're gone but I
can still enjoy like up until we leave
with my real Christmas tree okay now I'm
just gonna be putting on I can see
whether I'm using the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer in my last video when I
was talking about how I like never try
new concealers so many of you guys were
like Kristen you have to try Tarte
shaped teeth I've actually tried
heart-shaped tape but I felt like when I
used it it was just really hard to blend
out and I was like I don't know if I
love it so then I returned it so now I
have no Tarte shaped tape but now that
all you guys are telling me that it's
like the best concealer ever you're
really making me second-guess my
decision we'll see what happens to set
my face today I'm going to be using the
Too Faced peach perfect powder and I've
really been liking this powder it has a
little bit more luminosity to it but it
actually looks really pretty on the skin
and it's very smoothing as well and
before I do anything else I'm actually
gonna put these socks on because these
came in the fabfitfun box these are the
points to do aloe infused cozy socks
bees retail for $19 they are so cute and
my feet are freezing right now so why
not just put them on and test them out
so here's my socks and I don't know what
Atlin penis means but I guess it's just
like moisturizes your feet which that's
amazing for bronzer I'm going to be
using the it sunshine and a compact good
old Marcus you really did a good job
when he bought this for me
it doesn't look like it's sitting on top
of your skin which is what I hate about
some like powder products but this just
looks so nice and for blush today I'm
going to be using one that I've never
used before I yeah I don't think that I
use this before this is the Too Faced
love flush blush and the shade Baby Love
hands-down cutest blushes of all time a
word
goes to these they have little bunnies
and printed into the blush 10 out of 10
packaging and then for our highlight
today I'm going to be using one of the
products that came in the fabfitfun box
this is the deuce deep do this is the
Dulce free Matic eyeshadow Pro palette
and I got the nude palette and these
retail for $70 here's what the palette
looks like very nice and I'm gonna be
using this highlighter on my cheeks I'm
just gonna put a little on my brush oh
that is pretty oh my gosh this actually
looks very good on your skin especially
because you know how sometimes uhm
highlights make your skin texture look a
little bit bumpy like it emphasizes your
pores too much this one does not do that
at all
so I love that okay I'm gonna go do my
brows off-camera and I'll be right back
I'm just using the same thing that I
always use the old the Anastacio Brown
powder and soft brown now I'm going to
do my eye shadow using that same palette
right here and I love this palette has a
lot of matte shades so you can use this
one as your all-over lid shade and then
this in your crease this adds like a
deep inner or you can use that as an
eyeliner like I feel like this palette
has a lot of options which I really like
and I'm going to use this light cream
shade all over my lid to set my eye just
to make everything blend a lot easier
and now I'm gonna go in with a little
bit of a smaller brush like this and I'm
going to take that matte medium brown
color and put that in my crease I think
I'm going to go in with this shimmery
like champagne color with my finger and
put that on my eyelid see how this goes
this one is a little bit less pigmented
it seems like then the
Matt shadows and now I'm going to go
into this color right here and I'm going
to put that on my outer corners so this
is the eye look I ended up with I had to
really build these colors up because I
feel like they are they aren't pigmented
but you just have to build them up to
get it to maybe the intensity that you
want but I really like how this eye look
turned out okay now I'm just gonna be
putting on some mascara I'm using the
Loreal voluminous lashes is one of the
best mascaras I've ever tried and it
just makes your lashes so long so fluffy
and luminous and even if you don't have
the best lashes like me I don't have
like insanely long or thick lashes but
this really makes them look so nice like
look it back one swipe and it's like
it's so much better for my lips today I
am gonna use Kat Von D's everlasting
liquid lipstick in the shade of philia
this is actually a new one to me I've
never tried it before I'm kind of
nervous because it looks really light
but maybe I don't know if it's bad then
we could just change it I think this
might be too nude for me guys so I'm
gonna go over it with another one so I'm
going to be using Kat Von D's Lolita to
this color like will lead it to better
and I think that this whole look goes
well together so I'm happy about that
now we have a few accessories from
fabfitfun that I'm gonna wear today and
the first one is this BB Dakota poncho
and I got the color black and it's just
basically a massive massive massive oh
scarf so here is what this scarf looks
like well it's not a scarf technically
it's technically a poncho but you can
just wear a ton of
ways and this retails for $70 and then
we have another accessory that I'm going
to be wearing today this is the eight
other reasons this is a necklace and
this necklace retails for $58 okay so
here is what the necklace looks like
it's really cute it's just very simple
I love how fab that fun always does like
very simple dainty jewelry because
that's my favorite type of jewelry you
also have the hava dead sea water
mineral hand cream and i can definitely
use this to get ready because my hands
are actually extremely dry right now
this retails for $33 and I feel like
it's very good that they included a hand
cream in the winter box because that's
usually when your hands get very dry and
then we have a few things that I wasn't
able to use in this get ready with me
the first one is this Nelson Jay Beverly
Hills moisture healing mask and this
retails for $23 and basically this is a
hair mask but it also helps with like
the volume of your hair so it gives your
hair more body and I'm excited to use
this but I couldn't use this day coz I
had already washed my hair and then we
also got something that I am very
excited about because I've always wanted
to try this this is the Kate Somerville
exfoli Kate this retails for $75 so I'm
gonna be very sparing with this and it's
basically supposed to brighten your skin
remove any dead skin from your face and
then the last item that I obviously it
couldn't really use to get ready is this
workout ball they actually put these
workout balls in at the boxes because
they partnered with jillian michaels and
you can actually watch a bunch of
workout videos to see how to use this
and the total value of this box is 373
dollars to 393 dollars depending on
which different products that you want
you guys got your winter box let me know
what your favorite products were and I
hope that you guys enjoy it getting
ready with me today
I'm so excited to go get my Christmas
tree and thank you to fat but fun we're
partnering with me and if you guys did
