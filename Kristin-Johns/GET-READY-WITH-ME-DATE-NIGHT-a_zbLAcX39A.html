ready because I'm going on a date night
with Marcus so I just wanted to show you
guys how I got ready I did my makeup my
hair my skincare and also my outfit so
there's a whole lot to cover in this
video but I feel like I haven't filmed a
makeup video in a while so I felt like
it was about time to do that so I really
hope that you guys like this video and
let's just get started
so I'll start out with my skincare
before I do my makeup and so before I do
my makeup I really like to have a clean
base so I'm going to be using the first
aid Beauty pure skin face cleanser and
this is a really really good cleanser if
you have sensitive skin because it's
really gentle it hasn't broken me out at
all so I just like to put this on my
skin rub it in and then I'm really
excited to show you guys the next step
of my skincare routine this is the
vanity planet ultimate skin spa I've
been using this for a while now it comes
with three brush heads this is the more
sensitive one and you can use it at
different speeds fast and way faster and
it also comes with a more exfoliating
one and then a more plastic bristle one
which is really good to get off dead
skin or if you're wearing a lot of
makeup it gets it off really well so I'm
going to be using the sensitive brush
today and I just use it in circular
motions and it just gets off any of the
excess makeup that your cleanser didn't
get off it also exfoliates really well
and what I found with this product is
that it really really helped with my
skin's texture like sometimes I get
little clogged pores or just little
bumps on my face and this has really
just helped even out my skin and get rid
of any of those bumps so if you guys
have any problems with your skin or
you're just looking for a better way to
cleanse your skin this one is so so good
to use and I actually have a discount
code which I'm so excited about it's an
amazing discount code it's 70% off this
system so this is only going to be $38
if you use my code and it's usually a
hundred and twenty-five so I'll link
that down below but I really really
recommend you guys check it out it's
really really good
okay so after my face is all clean I
always like to moisturize my face before
I start doing my makeup and today I'm
going to be using the Tula hydrating day
and night cream and this works really
well before your makeup it just makes
your makeup go on really smooth and just
really gives a nice hydrated base to
your skin before putting on your makeup
so I'm just going to put that all over
my face okay now I'm going to move on to
Foundation and I'm going to be mixing
two colors of the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation I seriously love this
foundation so much and I've had the
color nude for so long but I'm finally
running really low on it I think it's
about to run out see ooh I've got a
little bit and then I'm going to mix a
little bit of the shade warm beige in
there too because the nude one is a
little bit too white I'm just making a
little foundation mixture and I mix it
right on to my Beauty Blender and then I
take the little bit that's there on
there and then I just pop it all over my
face and I forgot to tell you guys I'm
using the black Beauty Blender today I
just got this in the mail the other day
it's so different than the pink Beauty
Blender I don't know if it's all in my
head but I feel like this one is almost
a little bit smoother feeling I don't
know am I just because my pink one was
so old and I just felt like it was
getting a little bit rougher oh but this
one is just so soft I feel like it just
works really well so I've been really
liking to use the Black Beauty Blender
lately and then I'm going to use the
naked skin by urban decay concealer
underneath my eyes and also on my
forehead where I have some breakouts
I haven't had a breakout and so long
since I've been using that cleansing
system but I just flew the other day and
I feel like every single time I get on a
plane I always break out for some reason
and I don't know why so I'm just going
to put that where I need it and then
just blend that in with the same Beauty
Blender
then after I'm done putting on my
concealer and foundation I just go over
everything again with my Beauty Blender
- really I don't know I just feel like
it really presses it into the skin so it
doesn't just look like it's sitting on
top of your face it kind of just looks
like it is your face and that's the
goals then I'm going to take my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I use this
every single day and I'm just going to
take a little bit on my damp Beauty
Blender and put that underneath my eyes
and also everywhere else to set my face
now I'm going to move on to bronzer and
I just got this brush from japonesque
and it's called the blending brush face
blending brush it kind of looks like the
NARS eat a brush that everybody always
talks about you know the one that's kind
of shaped like this but it's just like
the giant version of it and I got this
because I thought it would be perfect
for bronzing your face just going to dip
this into a little bit of hoola bronzer
and let's see how this works gotta get
my hair out of the way wow I think I
love it and then I'm just turning it
like this to kind of blend everything
out upwards guys I think that this is my
new favorite brush it works so fast and
it's kind of like a mixture between
contouring and just bronzing all over
since it's not such a small precise line
but it's not kind of all over your face
I really like this and then I'm just
going to kind of take a little bit more
and just go down my jaw and also down
minute I'll link this down below I'm
pretty sure they sell japonesque at Ulta
I don't know where else it's sold
okay now that I'm all bronze up I'm
going to be using this blush by Tarte
and it's called captivating
and it's just a really nice kind of
muted coral color and I love it so much
I use it all the time and I'm going to
be taking this on the morphe 34 I was
using this for a while for bronzer but
now I just really like it for blush so
I'm just going to take a little bit of
that and put it right on the apples of
my cheeks now I'm going to take this
fancy little doodad this is the Dior
nude air Luminizer and the shade 0:01
and this is limited edition it's so
pretty I actually had a gift card for
Dillard's and I went in there and I saw
this and I was like wow this is
beautiful
and I showed you guys this on snapchat
but I don't really know if you got a
good look at it because Marcus was
distracting me the whole time so this is
what it looks like it's so pretty it's
just a nice like champagne color and
it's just beautiful and I'm just going
to take that on the morphe M 501 brush
and put that on microphone and I really
really like this highlighter it's kind
of different because it's not super
duper shiny it kind of just gives you
more of a natural look if you like more
of a intense highlight I probably
wouldn't go for this one but if you want
more of like a really pretty natural
everyday highlight this one is really
good and we're going to move on to the
fun part wait actually the fun part is
after the eyebrows so I'm going to do my
eyebrows really quick where's my eyebrow
brush come on
eyebrow brush where are you okay found
it so I never really talk about what I
use for my eyebrows I've never really
done a video showing me doing my
eyebrows because I just think it's kind
of boring to watch but I'm using a Mac
263 brush I've used this brush for ever
to do my eyebrows I think it's really
really good and I use the Anastacio soft
brown eyebrow duo thingy so I'm just
gonna go do my eyebrows now
and then I take this stuff and this
stuff is like glue for your eyebrows and
I need glue for my eyebrows because all
throughout the day they always go like
this if I don't they just fall down and
look so weird so I always use this stuff
it's a lifesaver so if you have wild
brows I highly recommend the Anastasio
clear brow gel it's good and now it's on
to the fun part and the fun part is the
eyes so I'm going to zoom you guys in a
little bit so I'm going to take a little
bit of this NARS smudge proof eyeshadow
primer which is the only primer I've
ever tried that actually makes my eye
shadow stay on because my eyelids are
super oily weirdly enough and for
eyeshadow today I'm going to be using my
makeup geek eyeshadows and this is what
they look like if you guys ever want me
to do a video showing you all the
different colors I have I will
definitely do that
I love watching those videos so just let
me know if you want to see that and I
will definitely do that and I'm going to
take this brush which is the Mac 2 1 7
and I'm going to take this color which
is called creme brulee and just dip into
that a little bit and make sure to tap
off the excess and then I'm just going
to put that in my crease and I love
these eyeshadows so much because they
just blend so easily which is my least
favorite part of doing my eyeshadow is
blending because it takes so long and
then I'm gonna go in with the shade
cocoa bear and it's just this really
pretty warm brown color and this one is
going to go right on the outer corner of
my eye with the same brush and then once
you get all that blended out I'm going
to use this color which is called
grandstand so if my camera just cut out
when I was saying that but I just took
grandstand
and I put that with my finger on both
eyes and now I'm going to take that same
217 brush and I'm going to take a little
bit of the shade called steampunk and
it's just this pretty reddish shimmery
color and I'm just going to put that a
little bit on the outer corner just to
blend everything out and then I'm going
to take this big fluffy brush this one
is from Sigma and it's the tapered
blending be 40 and I'm just going to
take a little bit of this matte white
shade called vanilla bean and I'm going
to put that on my brow bone to highlight
and then I'm going to take a little bit
of the shade called shimma shimma and
I'm going to put that in my inner corner
to highlight and then I'm going to take
my eyeliner this is the Physicians
Formula
eye booster my all-time favorite
eyeliner and I'm just going to put that
a little bit on the lash line I'm not
going to do a wing or anything but I'm
just going to add a little bit more
definition and today I'm not going to be
adding any mascara to my top eyelashes
because I actually have eyelash
extensions I have for the past about two
months so if you guys want a video about
eyelash extensions and everything about
them I will definitely do that because I
kind of wanted to see a video about
eyelash extensions before I got them but
I couldn't really find any but I can't
put mascara on them so I'm just going to
take a little spoolie and brush them
through I'm actually going to get them
filled in a few days but it's really
really nice and not having to wear any
mascara I'm just going to add a little
bit of benefit roller lash mascara to my
bottom lashes and I don't really know
what I'm going to be doing for lipstick
today I have a few options
I could go kind of more nude and do
velvet teddy by Mac or I could go more
warm and go with the whole look and do
Echo Park by colour-pop I think I'm
going to go with velvet teddy
and we are officially done with makeup
and I really like how it turned out I
think it's a nice bronzy look perfect
for summer so um now I'm going to go
change and I'll be right back I just
changed my outfit I also did my hair
because I did not think that I would be
able to do the side braid thing that I
did but it kind of worked out better
than I expected I just didn't film it
because I didn't think I would be able
to and so now I will show you my outfit
so we have a slight dilemma on our hands
because no one is here to help me film
my outfit so I figured that in the
mirror would be the best way I'm just
wearing this little romper from Urban
Outfitters you can help me film my
outfit okay so for my outfit today now I
have Marcus to help me film it I'm
wearing this little romper and it's from
urban and it has a little tie here and
it's really cute and comfy and then my
shoes are also from urban the new shoes
there's my shoes these are also from
urban I'll link them both below in case
you want to look at them um do you like
my outfit Marcus I love it
it's perfect okay guys I really hope
that you like this video if you did like
it please give it a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe for new videos every
single week I really like filming these
