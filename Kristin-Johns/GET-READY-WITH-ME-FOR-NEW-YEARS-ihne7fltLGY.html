ready for New Year's Eve and me and
Marcus have no plans so I don't really
know like the occasion I'm getting ready
for it but I want something like a
little festive and pretty so I'm just
gonna bring you guys along on the
journey with me I'm also gonna be
showing you guys how I do my hair and
also my outfit so this is like a full
get ready with me which I love because
sometimes they don't show you everything
okay the first thing I'm gonna do is
prime and I'm gonna be using this little
sample that I have of this hourglass
veil primer I remember getting a sample
of this I think I was in high school and
I remember liking it so I have another
sample and I want to try it again
this primer feels so soft on your skin I
remember it having the weirdest texture
and it still does it's like very soft
powdery feeling and I think I'm gonna be
using this today for my foundation it's
the a cosmetics CC cream and don't let
the name fool you because this stuff is
so full cut I just get myself in the
nose this stuff is very full coverage so
just because it says CC cream it's still
like one of the most full coverage I've
ever used so I'm going to be putting
some of that on a morphe m43 9 brush I
never really use this brush but my
favourite foundation brush is so dirty
right now it's like you know when your
foundation brush is so dirty the hairs
or stuff the others that's how this one
is so I'm just gonna be using this one
and I don't know if I love this brush
because it's just so it's like so hard I
feel like it's really tugging your face
when you're blending your foundation so
I'm just gonna go over everything with
my Beauty Blender just to make sure
everything's like not streaky I just put
on some concealer underneath my eyes the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer this
might be too light for me right now so
today is a very bright under-eye day as
you can see so I'm just gonna take some
Laura Mercier powder and this
usually kind of blends everything
together so I think we'll be okay
guys my camera just cut me off but I was
in the middle of putting on some of the
Kat Von D contour powder I'm using this
middle one and I was in the middle of
telling you guys that I'm so excited for
the new year and I'm also talking about
new year's resolutions but the camera
cut me off every single time the new
year comes around I just feel like it's
such a fresh start I don't know I just
get more inspired like in general like
in every aspect of my life I get more
inspired to just like be better and just
make new goals and really achieve them
in the next year I feel like my biggest
resolution of 2017 is just to kind of
like handle stress a little bit better
especially at the end of 2017 I was just
extremely overwhelmed and when I'm
overwhelmed it's like hard for me to
have close personal relationships
because I'm just like I just kind of
like block everyone out when I'm very
stressed so I just want to become better
at handling stress because I mean life
is gonna get stressful sometimes and I
gotta be able to handle it so that's my
biggest resolution also I just wasn't
telling you any of the makeup that I was
using so I used Tarte exposed blush for
my blush and then I used um color pops
flexitarian super shock cheek pretty
gorgeous highlighter on my cheeks I
think I'm going to be using a Mac
pigment today I pulled these out of my
drawer and I have not used these and so
long so I have the color melon and then
I have a sample size of tan and these
used to be all the rage like I wanted
every single Mac pigment
I only ever got this one and full-sized
because they were kind of expensive I
don't know which one I'm going to use I
think melon would be super pretty but
before I put on one of those I'm gonna
take the color pop I don't even know
what this is called I think I love you
palette and it looks kind of fast to be
like New Year's but I'm gonna be taking
this white color and just put that all
over my lid
and then I'm going to take this shade
right here which is like the matte brown
color and I'm going to put that in my
crease okay now I want to put on a
pigment because that's the most eye part
I think I'm gonna use this shade melon
look at that I've had this since high
school and I used it like every single
day in high school and it's still full
to the very top so I think the best way
to apply pigments is with a flat top
brush so I'm just gonna spray this with
some Urban Decay all nighter spray just
so that the pigment really picks up and
I'm just gonna take a little bit of it
like this and put that on my lid I
forgot how pretty this color is I love
it so much
okay I'm gonna go back in with this
brown that I initially put in the crease
just to make sure everything is blended
okay now I'm gonna go do my eyebrows and
put on some mascara and I'll be right
back
okay so I put on some mascara I also put
on some of that brown shade underneath
my eyes and I use the L'Oreal voluminous
lash mascara and I also wanted to
mention if I ever forget to say a
product that I use I always list
everything down in the description box
so I almost forgot to tell you about
this so that's why that reminded me and
for lips I have this little mini huda
beauty liquid lipstick and this one is
in the shade icon I've never worn this
before so let's see if it's pretty
that's much more orange than I thought I
don't think this is the color okay I
think I'm gonna use this Natasha - no no
lipstick in the shade oh it's just a
really pretty like pinky purple color
let's see if that looks good I think I
like this color a lot better cuz it's
just more chill so just brush my hair
and I slept in a bun last night so it's
just very confused so what it is right
now but I'm gonna be using this t3 micro
I've never used this before but they
send it to
and it just looked so interesting
because it goes like bigger at the end
never even use like a hair tool from
this brand but I know I've heard about
it a lot so let's see what kind of curls
this this puppy gives it looks like gave
a pretty curl like kind of a little bit
like looser on the ends which I like ok
so here are the types of curls that that
wand gave me I actually forgot to tell
you what this attachment is called this
one is called the cascading I think it's
called the cascading curls or cascading
waves I'm not really sure um but I think
gave really pretty and curls it's like
very tight right now but it'll loosen up
it'll loosen up okay now mark this is
gonna help me show you guys my outfit
I've hit ready okay so here's what I'm
gonna be wearing today and my shirt is
from booboo and my skirt is from thredUP
slash Topshop and then my boots are from
Nordstrom ok guys that is it for my New
Year's Eve get ready with me I really
hope that you guys liked it if you did
