my living room you can't really see my
living room but I'm behind my couch
right now because this is where the best
lighting in the house is so I figured I
would change up the location a little
bit but today I'm going to be showing
you guys how I get ready for the day I'm
going to be doing my makeup my hair and
also going to be showing you an outfit
but also today I'm going to be trying
out a lot of new product which I'm
excited about first I'll start with
primer and I'm not going to do a new
primer so they don't have a new primer
but I'm going to be using the tooth base
hangover RX primer I love this one so
much it just feels like I'm putting a
really good-smelling moisturizer on my
face and now I'm going to go in with my
foundation and today I'm going to be
actually using a sample of the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation which
I've always wanted to try and I just
never have because it's so what they
expensive but I got a little sample from
Nordstrom and it came in this nice glass
bottle and I've heard that this
foundation is very like liquidy so I
don't know if I should use a brush or a
Beauty Blender I think I might go in
with a brush first this is the color I
have I hope that this is good because if
your foundation looks bad it kind of
messes up your whole look so seems like
it matches it so it's going on very
nicely and it seems like it's a good
color match also I'm using this
japonesque kind of like foundation brush
I wanted to tell you guys that my house
is almost completely done which the most
exciting part is that means that I'm
going to be doing a house tour very soon
the last thing that I had to do was this
wall like right there you can't see it
right now but it's a huge blank wall and
I needed to put pictures on it because
I'm making a gallery wall and I finally
finished the gallery wall yesterday it
took me so long because I painted pretty
much all the pictures that I'm using for
it I'm so excited to show you
I think it's gonna really like pull the
whole house together and also it means
that I'm going to be able to show you
guys my house also I think that this
foundation looks very beautiful on the
skin I just heard a lot of mixed reviews
about this foundation so a little bit
nervous but some people like swear by
cancer but I think the main complaint
that I've heard about this foundation is
that it doesn't last that long that's
the number one thing or that is to
sheered I can't really remember but I
know I've heard some bad things about it
okay so here's what the foundation look
like I think it looks really nice okay
so now I'm going to be doing my
concealer which I'm not using a new
product for my concealer because this is
just my favorite and I just got a new
bottle of it so I gotta use it oh I
didn't even tell you what this was this
is the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
also I don't know if you guys noticed or
not but I don't have eyelash extensions
anymore I pretty much just ripped them
all off because I got so annoyed of
hacking them I had just had them for so
long and I was just getting really sick
of it so I took them all off and I'm
giving my eyes a break for a while and I
do feel like a little naked mole-rat
without them because they were pretty
like dramatic all the time but now I
just look in the mirror I'm like I feel
like that's the real me like I don't I
don't know I don't feel like had fake
eyelashes on 24/7 so um I like it for
now I might do them again one day but
not for a while but the reason I was
saying that is because it just makes
doing your makeup so much easier because
I can just like blend all around my eye
without having to worry about like
messing them up and making them look
weird so feels very good to do makeup
like this I'm going to be setting my
face and oh I'm using a new product for
that I'm using the Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish in the shade to
medium and I heard great things about
this powder I've only used it once since
I got it but I think what Charlotte
Tilbury packaging is my favorite I love
all of her packaging so I'm really
excited to use it I don't really have a
good powder brush so I will use this
little highlighting brush to go
underneath my eyes let's see I like this
this brush is way too tiny for powder is
actually a highlighting brush but all I
got right now so who's going to take a
while I actually do like this powder
it's very like natural on your skin it
doesn't really look like you are wearing
any powder it's amazing yeah I really
like this okay for bronzer today I am
going to be using cool
I love hoola bronzer just going to be
putting this kind of everywhere because
I feel like I look very pale right now
so bronze it up so I'm also going to be
using a new blush today this is the Too
Faced pop adult peach blush not t just
the cutest thing ever it's just like a
very beautiful peach color and it looks
like it has maybe a little bit of
shimmer in it by yourself ooh
oh yeah it is a little bit shimmery hey
rad time guys I forgot to tell you that
since I moved to LA I didn't know anyone
to do brows because usually get my brows
waxed but my sister-in-law told me about
her girl that threads her eyebrows so
I've been getting my eyebrows threaded
and I really like it
it's a little bit more painful than
waxing in my opinion but I think it's
like shaped better you know what I'm
saying
so I really like it
and this palette is a funny story this
is the tart I never not say this tart
kissed I'm just a face tart east maybe
that's it
the Tarkus pro palette by tart and a
beautiful palette and look at that
look at that it has a humongous mirror
in it and the funny thing is I got this
at at art of it part of it
at art event that I went to the other
week and they would have like a little
station where you could decorate your
own palette and I was going to give this
away so I wrote love Kristen and then I
decorated it and then I got home and
without even thinking about it i
swatched some of the colors and then I
was like you can't give away a palette
that you already dug your grimy little
fingers in so I'm not giving away this
exact palette but I do have a ton of
things that I have compiled for a
giveaway and I think I'm going to maybe
do a giveaway soon or maybe I'll make
the giveaway like massive and do a
400,000 subscriber giveaway so be on the
lookout for that I have like an entire
bag in that room that's filled with
makeup and stuff like that that I'm
really excited to give to you guys so
today I'm going to be using this palette
that was meant to be for love you guys
and I'm first going to go into this like
muted can color and I'm just going to be
putting that all over my lid and now I'm
going to use the shade bulb which is a
little bit of a darker tan color and put
that in my crease and just define it a
tiny bit
okay now I'm going to take the shade
whimsy which is a really pretty like
muted red color I guess that's how I
would explain it and I'm just going to
put that on the outer corners and then
I'm going to take the shade cereal which
is this pretty like bronzy color up here
and I'm just going to use my finger and
put that on my lid I always use my
finger for shimmery shades I feel like
it just works better it's a little bit
easier and you get more of the color
payoff with your fingers and then I'm
just going to take a tiny little flat
brush and take the color glam which is
more of a gold champagne color and I'm
just going to put that on my inner part
of my lid I'm going to be using a new
liquid eyeliner today this is the super
cat skinny liner by soap &amp;amp; Glory and
I've never used any soap &amp;amp; Glory makeup
really I think if maybe tried like one
of their lip glosses but this is what it
looks like very nice and shirt and I'm
going to try to stay in frame for this
but you know you know how it goes
so now I'm going to be curling my
eyelashes and applying mascara my
eyelashes are so tiny guys just be
warned this isn't really going to do a
walk because my eyelashes have been
through the wringer with so much time of
eyelash extensions for my lips today I
think this is the duo I'm going to go
with I have whirl by Max okay and then I
have this Tarte tarnis lip paint and
this was a Sephora on the birthday perk
so I'm not sure what the name of this is
Oh birthday suit I've used this once and
I couldn't tell if I loved the color so
let me just see what happens cuz I might
end up taking it off
lip liner on lipstick about two beyond
see it's very light I don't know about
it and I never wear colors like this the
thing about this lipstick is that it
it's called a lip paint but it doesn't
really dry down matte like I feel like
it's very transferee so I feel like I
have to top like this so it doesn't get
on my feet now I'm going to go do my
hair let's see the status of my hair
right now because I might not even do it
today I think I might just leave my hair
straight and it may be like put it up in
a clip or something because I really do
not feel like curling okay so I just
changed but first I want to show you
what jewelry I'm going to be wearing
today so I'm going to be wearing some
jewelry from rocksbox and look how cute
this packaging is I love this packaging
so much but basically it rocks box is a
jewelry membership service so you pay
$21 a month and they send you
hand-picked jewelry I think it's three
items and it comes in this little box
and you can try out the pieces at your
house and you want to feel pressured to
buy it or anything and it also comes
with a prepaid shipping label so it
makes shipping and returning super easy
okay so in this lunch box I got these
earrings which are very cute
this little choker which is also just
like exactly everything that I love in
jewelry just like dainty and cute and I
also got this little knot cuff bracelet
oh if y'all are interested in rocksbox
you can use the code Kristin John's xoxo
and you can get your first month of
rock's box for free which is so so nice
okay and now I'm going to take you guys
into my room so I can show you of my
outfit here is my outfit altogether

brandy melville and the shorts that are
