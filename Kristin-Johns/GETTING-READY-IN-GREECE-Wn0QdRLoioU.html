now and I wanted to do a get ready with
me while I was here because it's just
the most peaceful place ever and also
I've been doing my makeup outside every
single morning because look at this view
I wanted to actually film with this view
in the background but the light was
coming from over here so it didn't work
this is my little makeup setup this is
my little cat friend that keeps
following us everywhere and this is our
hotel so adorable
little hammock oh the first thing that I
did this morning was put on some
moisturizer and now I'm gonna do some
primer and this is the only primer I've
been using on this whole trip it's the
Smashbox original photo finish smooth
and blur primer and I've been really
liking it I usually use of a more
hydrating primer but I tried this before
I left and I was like wow that actually
makes a huge difference in the way my
makeup looks so then I've been using
this the full trip this is he bye-bye
foundation from a cosmetics and SPF not
an SPF but it has SPF 50 plus in it
which I really like because it's
obviously very sunny here and I use the
shade medium tan and I use this on this
foundation brush which is so dirty guys
like the most dirty everyone wants okay
and I just really one pump is really
really good the cat that I showed you
guys has been here since last night when
I gave it a piece of chicken from our
leftover dinner
and marques fell asleep outside in the
hammock and the cats stayed out here
while he was asleep and then we went
inside to bed and I was like okay bye
cat and then I woke up this morning and
he was still out here sleeping and now
he's just sitting there watching me do
my makeup I've been using the Too Faced
concealer the Born This Way in the shade
cool medium I ran out of my Urban Decay
concealer right before I left and I was
like I'll just bring this instead and
that exact same thing happened with my
foundation too I ran out of my Too Faced
Born This Way and I was like oh I'll
just bring this but I ended up really
loving this combination stuff and I was
kind of stuck with it for two weeks so
I'm glad that I picked it all so if you
hear some bubbling in the background
that's our pool it's right there so I'm
hoping that it's more relaxing than it
is annoying for you guys I'm just like
getting in the mood of the Paradise
vacation one of my favorite parts has
been using a brush like this with this
product this is the Chanel so late and a
Chanel and I have been wanting this
product probably for three years now and
I just never got accept 50 dollars for
this cream bronzer but then I had a
Nordstrom gift card and I was like I'm
just gonna buy this for a vacation
because I feel like I'll use it a lot
and I put that kind of where I would put
my bronzer
for powder I've been using this which I
kind of have a love-hate relationship
with this is the Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush finish wallace powder and you
can see I pit pan in it and I really do
like it for the face I just don't love
it for under my eyes but the reason is
that it gets kind of like a yellow under
my eyes probably because I just have a
little bit too dark for shade to use
under my eyes but other than that I
really haven't loving it a lot and of
course for blush you guys probably
already know but I'm gonna be using
tarts captivating and just putting that
on my cheeks this blush I use every
single day just in regular life but also
if you need like a really good summary
vacation blush I feel like it's the
perfect like peachy peachy color okay I
want to tell you guys a little bit about
Greece in case you've never been before
or maybe you are like wanting to go
Greece has amazing food the nicest
people the most beautiful scenery
amazing weather like everything about it
is amazing and I'll show you guys a
little tour of our hotel after I'm done
because a lot of you guys have been
asking about it but we actually booked
this hotel the night before we came me
and Marcus are very last-minute planners
when it comes to vacations but it always
ends up working for us
also one of my favorite things has just
been waking up super early and coming
outside and doing my makeup I don't know
why but it's just the most peaceful
thing to do your makeup outside but just
coming outside and doing your makeup in
the morning
right it's like I'm gonna miss it so
much for eyeshadow I've been doing the
same thing every single day first take
this fluffy one and I take the color Tim
Pyrrha from Anastacio soft glam palette
oh oh shoot I got weird things on my
face I just put that all over my eyelid
and then I take this brush the r37
and I take the shade burnt orange and I
put that in my crease
very very sloppily by the way then I
take this tiny brush and I take both
burnt orange and sienna and I put those
underneath my lash line I'm just gonna
eat a loss and really because my throat
kind of hurts so I'm gonna be using the
falls sue there's today my voice is
gonna be so weird because I have this
lost and didn't know I'll try to get
this down tweedily the final step is
lips I've been using the Kylie cosmetics
lip liner and ginger I'm actually almost
out of this how tiny it is and I just
put it right around my lip line then I'm
using the Bobbi Brown fresh lip color
and it says on nude susana's one of my
best friends so got a supportive bestie
and I also love this color and I've been
using it everyday if you need like a
perfect everyday color this is like the
best and it's super lightweight so it
doesn't feel like anything's on your
lips that I've been doing the makeup
every day for the past two weeks and I
still have this loccent in my mouth I'm
really sorry I want to show you guys my
hotel really quick because I think you
guys really like kitty what are you
still doing here here I don't know what
you're doing here so to get into our
hotel room you walk through these really
cute blue doors and let me find the
light where's the light here is what it
looks like okay so all pretty much
houses in Greece are like this cave
style which i think is so beautiful and
it's just so simple and everything is
just like exactly what I love so these
light fixtures we have a full-size
mirror here should I just do a little
outfit of the day outfit of the day is
this dress from ASOS which I've had for
a really long time and I actually think
I've worn it in a video before but yeah
that's our bed
this is our closet which doesn't have
anything in it because we are all packed
up ready to leave
cute little chair this cat won't leave
me alone and then you walk up here to
the bathroom and it's really adorable
