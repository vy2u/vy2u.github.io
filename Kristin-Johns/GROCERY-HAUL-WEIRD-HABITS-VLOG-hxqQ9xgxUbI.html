whirlwind that's why it's like 1 o'clock
and I haven't started vlogging yet I was
playing on vlogging my whole day but
Marcus woke up at 8:30 with like severe
food poisoning he wasn't so much pain
and it was the scariest thing ever I
have never seen him that sick before
camper was so worried about him he was
like crying scratching on the bathroom
door trying to get in with him um but
yeah Marcus was super sick for like two
hours straight and then he laid in bed
and we watched the office and now he is
feeling way better he actually had to go
run some errands hey hey hey no biting I
just feel like what the heck it's so
weird cuz he was so sick and and then he
just like got better I guess that's just
sometimes how food poisoning works or
whatever he had some kind of bug but
anyway that just is why I just started
vlogging but the doorbell just rang and
I'm pretty sure my fabfitfun box is here
because it was supposed to come today
okay so here it is um all this box is so
cute you think that's cute too come on
super okay so as I'm sure a lot of you
guys know I am partnered with fab the
fun I have partnered with them pretty
much since like the start of my youtube
channel I've done so many different
unboxings with them and I usually do it
the same way of just sitting down
opening the box and showing you guys the
products but I thought it would be
really fun today if I actually open the
products and showed you guys what's in
it and then use the products throughout
the day and if you guys don't know what
fabfitfun is I will let you know what it
is it is a seasonal subscription box it
is $49.99 and they have all full-size
products of pretty much everything you
could ever want they have beauty stuff
fitness stuff lifestyle just all the
good things
Kippur you gotta move or else they're
not gonna be able to see anything
oh that was a double sneeze sorry camper
okay here we go
okay so here is what everything looks
like in the box
I feel like there's a ton of stuff in
this box okay so the first thing in here
is this jewelry holder I'm so curious to
see how they fit this in here oh my gosh
this is cute
I can't sound too excited or camper
comes over to me and it's like what's
going on okay so here's what the jewelry
holder looks like that's so cute you can
put your rings down here hang some
earrings on there and this is just very
adorable do you love that okay
okay so this retails for $33 and I love
this this is very cheap the next thing
in here is this this is the ice ice baby
hot and cold gel pack this would
actually be so perfect for cramps
because I've actually been getting very
bad period cramps lately and I've never
really had horrible cramps before so
this is perfect and this retails for $15
okay
the next thing in here is this belt this
is from the brand below the belt this is
the Mia belt and here's what it looks
like it's just a brown belt with a
little gold clasp and also it came and
black and some other people's boxes and
I love this because it's just super
simple I feel like this would just go
with everything and this retails for $55
we also got the private party gym bag so
here is what mine looks like it says
will workout for cupcakes which is so
perfect and this retailed for $59 well
since Cambria decided to chew on this I
guess this will be my next item that I
you guys know okay this is the mercy
cozy wood cozy cozy wrap this is a scarf
but you can also use it as a ton of
other things like you it says on here
that you can use it as like a blanket on
your bed and I'm very happy because this
color is like my favorite kind of color
for house decor like these soft pinks
and whites and I just love it
this actually retails for $98 so the
fact that it's included in the box is so
nice
why didn't show has tassels up in which
are really cute too you look like such a
little man impact this is such a cute
little box is so adorable is the deco of
Miami cuticle oil and lavender this
packaging is adorable
and here's what it looks like and this
retails for 1250 I don't know if you
guys could tell in like some previous
videos but I had gotten acrylic nails
for the first time and they destroyed my
nails so I'm trying to kind of like help
grow back my natural nails so this oil
will be super helpful I feel like we
also have this in the box this is the
wish renewing mud mask this retails for
$48 so this is a more expensive mask I
will definitely be using this tonight
and showing you guys this comes in a
pump I never ever used a mask that comes
in a pump that is a genius idea so I'm
very excited to use this tonight also
have this ooh this is a pretty red color
this is the mystique matte lip color
plus shiny balm lip crayon this retails
for $28 wait so I'm guessing does it
come with two or is it double sided
oh it's double sided that's so cool so I
guess one side is matte and once
is one side is shiny and this packaging
is magnetic I'm actually gonna go ahead
and try this on because I'm gonna be
trying all these products anyway so I
should just start with the lips so let's
see how it looks
oh that's a very pigmented okay so
here's what the matte side looks like
it's very pretty
makes your teeth look really white and
should I just put a little bit of the
glossy side on top so here is this
lipstick I'm not sure if everyone got
the same color in the box but I really
like this red this retails for $28 and
the last thing in here this thing ooh
this is interesting this says it's an
apple cider vinegar hair rinse it says
that gently removes impurities this
retails for $35 I'm gonna try this
tonight and I'll tell you guys how I
like it
well I'm gonna be trying all of these
things but I'm gonna be washing my hair
later tonight and I'll let you know what
I think about this while I'm sitting
here maybe I should just try on the belt
so I can show you guys what that one
looks like so here is what the belt
looks like it's super cute and I just
like how simple it is unfortunately my
shirt is gonna cover it but here's what
it looks like if you are serious like I
said I'm gonna be vlogging the rest of
my day and I'm gonna be using all these
products letting you know how I like
them and if you guys are interested in
fact fun oh sorry
cuddle-up I have a $10 off coupon code
it's just simply Kristin and you can get
two dollars off your box okay so I just
ate some lunch I realized that I didn't
eat all day because I was taking care of
Marcus and I had eaten a bunch of
saltine crackers that I had given him
but I hadn't eaten in the actual food so
I just ate some yogurt and granola my
house is a little bit of a wreck well I
mean it doesn't look like such a wreck
but to me I just know there's so much to
be done just like I have to make the bed
my closet that I've been working
so much lately like probably more than I
ever have and I don't know I it's just
hard to keep the house perfectly clean
when I'm working so much so I am
definitely gonna get that done today
because I have accountability now that
I've said it on the camera also if you
guys are wondering this is very weird
I shouldn't even mention this but
basically when my sister was pregnant
she had this stuff lana lansinoh HPA
lanolin and she said it's like the best
chapstick ever and I've been using it as
chapstick and I know that it is actually
for sore and cracked nipples for when
you are breastfeeding but I know a lot
of people also use this for chapstick
because it's just like really thick and
nice I mean that looks really pretty for
a nipple cream me and Marcus just got
back from grocery shopping I got some
good stuff stuff that I've never seen
before so I wanted to show you guys what
I got I got bread this is the Trader
Joe's whole-grain bread love this one we
also got some turkey for sandwiches some
Greek yogurt I go through like a whole
one of these every single week because I
eat this breakfast every single morning
somewhat Muenster cheese for sandwiches
we also got a cucumber for sandwich
and salad got this for markets because I
wanted to get him a little treat um I
got him this cold pressed watermelon
juice this looked really really good
arugula my favorite green this is
exciting
I saw this on my friends Instagram story
and she said these are amazing these are
the Trader Joe's pumpkin waffles just
sounds so good
bananas we go through bananas like crazy
people I'm like Marcus are the monkeys
or are we humans because we go through
so many exciting things I got pumpkin
pie spice and ground nutmeg because I
want to make my own homemade pumpkin pie
I just also bought some pumpkin puree
so it's this even focused has been
focused at all but I just want to make
my own pumpkin pie some day soon so I
got from the back
and then I got some tomatoes for salads
or sandwiches and then this last thing I
wanted to tell you guys about because oh
my gosh because I just started making
Marcus this homemade honey lemonade it
is so good and he said it's like his
favorite lemonade he'd ever had and if
you guys know Marcus he is obsessed with
lemonade two bags of lemon because the
way that I make it is with honey water
and lemons and it is so good but dude
it's gonna be this one six when they
make watermelon juice the Tudor Jones
that's new this shirt makes me massive
juice Cody got me into watermelon juice
he's obsessing you should taste it on
camera give us a taste test it's amazing
you're disgusting it's just oh let me
taste it it's so good it's like you just
mushed up a watermelon that's all I'll
be freaking out about weird uh do you
love it good source of vitamin c na I
told him this morning that you were so
sick this morning I curled up in the
shower
releasing liquids from both ends of my
body at the same time curled up on the
ball you know any nice going it is white
it is much much later now I think it's
like 10:50 already but I
um but I cleaned the whole house I feel
so good now look at the difference look
at the difference at that closet oh why
is it like blue but I still want to try
out all of the rest of the products from
the fabfitfun box but since they were
all kind of like products that you use
after or in the shower I had to wait
until I showered so I'm gonna be using
the apple cider vinegar shampoo and
conditioner substitute which I'm really
nervous about because I've never used
anything like this but I'll let you guys
know how it works out but I'm gonna go
get in the shower and then I'm gonna use
my face mask I just got out of the
shower and I put on the face mask and
then I read the directions and I didn't
realize but I think this is an intense
mask because it says begin by leaving on
for 15 seconds and slowly work up to two
minutes use one to two times per week so
I think this is more of like it's gonna
really do something so I've had it on
for about probably a whole minute now so
I'm gonna wash it off but it smells
really nice and it went really nice
that face mask actually made my face
feel so soft usually face mask you can't
really tell after one use of what they
do but this one actually didn't really
make my skin feel super soft and I have
a little zit coming right here so
hopefully it gets rid of that I'm just
eating some strawberries what was the
other thing that I needed to tell you
guys oh I used the hair rinse and it was
so weird because I'm so used to
lathering hair things like shampoo and
conditioner and that one does not lather
at all but my hair actually feels very
clean it kind of feels like you know how
your hair feels after you've used like a
really cleansing shampoo or conditioner
that's what feels like really the last
thing I have to try from the spa
is the cuticle oil so I'm just gonna
apply this now cuz I wanted to apply it
before bed I'm just gonna put this all
along my cuticles and I heard that
cuticle oil is very important for the
health of your nails so I need to
actually start using this more often
because my nails are in bad shape right
now here's what my nails look like nice
and oiled up when they call Marcus to
see when he's coming in here because
he's in a studio editing he probably
won't be in bed for another 30 minutes
oh but then I was just thinking how
stupid it is that pretty much every
single night when he's working in his
studio like editing a video or whatever
I always FaceTime him and I just look at
the screen like this until he says okay
I'm coming in there now and then I was
just thinking how we have so many little
traditions that we do all the time like
little habits if you guys have a
boyfriend or girlfriend or wife or
husband comment down below weird things
that you guys tend to do that have just
started to be like a tradition in your
family because I just think that those
are the funniest thing but I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this kind of like
version of me unboxing the fabs at fun
box I think that this way is way more
fun because I can just show you guys all
the products and test out all the
products so you can really see what
they're like so if you do like that way
of unboxing let me know also I hope that
you guys have been enjoying my vlogs
lately like I said I'm trying to vlog at
least once a week for y'all so I really
hope you guys like that and I hope you
guys have a great day or night wherever
or whenever you're watching this and
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
subscribed yet I would love to have you
