ready with me video it's actually a
little bit late in the day it's like 2
o'clock but I haven't found anything I
was saying I haven't done my makeup yet
today and I'm gonna go run a few errands
and I also think that me and Marcus are
going to go on a little dinner date
later so I want to have at least a
little bit of makeup on I'm gonna be
also trying out a bunch of new products
some products that I've been using a for
a while that I haven't talked to you
guys about that I love and yes I'm
really excited and let's just get
started this is the new clinic
foundation it's called the even better
glow light reflecting makeup and this
has SPF 15 in it which is awesome this
is a great sheer to like medium coverage
foundation and the thing that I love
about it is that it hides your
imperfections but still like lets your
skin be seen through it so it's not like
a mask it's like it's just like your
skin but better and actually before I do
this I'm gonna put my hair up so like I
was saying I like using this foundation
with a brush instead of a sponge just
because with more lightweight
foundations I just feel like sometimes
the sponge soaks up too much of the
product so I just put a little bit on my
brush and another great thing about this
foundation is sometimes I get a little
bit nervous for luminizing foundations
but this one doesn't make you look oily
it really just makes your skin look
healthy and glowy this foundation has
vitamin C in it so it not only makes
your skin look super healthy right when
you apply it but over time it's gonna
really give your skin a healthy glow and
I would say this is good for all skin
types because like I said it doesn't
make you look oily and it is actually
very long wearing even though it is more
of a luminous foundation so it's like
all of the best things in one and if
you're someone that likes a little bit
more coverage
it's definitely buildable as well and
this
station is $28 you can find it at
Clinique comm and you can also find it
at Clinique counters worldwide okay now
on to concealer I'm using The Naked skin
up by urban decay concealer in the shade
light neutral this is kind of a
concealer that I use day-to-day because
it's really lightweight and I'm going to
use the same brush that I've been using
for a foundation and just blend that out
and for powder I'm going to be using
this morphe m58 one brush I don't think
I've mentioned this brush on my channel
before but this brush is like the best
multi-use brush you can use it for under
eyes for contouring for bronzing I
actually use it for bronzing sometimes
so you can see it's kind of dark but I
really like putting powder on with this
brush it's really good for that this
next thing I splurged on and it just
came in the mail oh I don't know if I'm
gonna like it I've never used it before
but it is a Victoria Beckham Estee
Lauder bronzer so I was shopping on
Sephora and I was just like I need a new
bronzer I use hoola every single day you
guys are probably sick of me using hoola
all the time I was like I'm just gonna
try I can't figure out how to open this
thing I was like I'm just gonna try a
different browser this is what it looks
like it's a really nice color it kind of
reminds me of hoola a little bit and I'm
gonna be using that on my trusty
japonesque brush you know what I
realized I really love japonesque
brushes and like no one talks about
japanesse brushes and they're like some
of my favorites I like it so far
it blends out very easily this blends
out so nicely guys what the heck I am
gonna put on some blush now this is a
brand new blush I've never even opened
it I placed a huge order on this for
guys and all of it just came so I'm so
excited to use all this it is from Becca
and it's called wild honey okay I'm just
gonna get a little bit
my brush let's see okay I turned on my
light a little bit so you can see more
of what it looks like I think I'm just
gonna keep my light down a tiny bit just
so you can see better I don't know I'm
trying to figure out this whole ring
white thing and I don't know I don't
know how I feel about it
the next thing I'm going to be using it
today is from sinh T beauty so hyped up
I know everyone has been talking about
all of the Finn T beauty lines so I
ordered one of the highlighters okay so
I got these shades mean money and hustla
babies and these looks like the best
shades for my skin tone so I don't know
which one to choose should I just mix
them together okay I'll just mix them
together that's so pretty look at that
wow those are very beautiful I love that
and I actually do have a new product for
my eyebrows I never ever try new brow
products
I always just use the Anastasia brow
powder but benefit actually just sent me
their new brow powders and brow powder
just feels like the safest option for me
these are called the foolproof brow
powders and oh and the powder actually
is in the shape of a little eyebrow but
it actually looks really similar to the
Anastacio brow powder which i love i'm
gonna be using the anastasia clear brow
gel which i always use and i'm pretty
much out of for my eye side of the day i
don't really feel like doing a ton I
just don't feel like it and I think I'm
just gonna take some of the bronzer that
I'm used on my face and put that in my
crease this is a trick that I love
because it's like multi-purpose makeup
is the best kind of makeup and bronzers
work as such good crease colors and then
I'm gonna be multi-purpose
again and I'm going to use the
highlighter that I just used as my eye
shadow so I'm just gonna take some of
the more gold shade which is hustla baby
and I'm just gonna use that as my lid
color and I think I wanted to fine my
eyes a little bit more I'm just gonna
take this shade from candy Johnson's Too
Faced palette and I'm gonna take the
shade hot chocolate which is that one
right there and I'm just gonna run that
along my upper lash line where you would
normally do regular eyeliner and for my
mascara I'm going to be using the
l'oreal voluminous lash erudite I love
this mascara and if you guys don't know
I had eyelash extensions for probably a
little over a year maybe even I don't
even know it was a long time and so
after I got them off my eyelashes were
so tiny and now they're just starting
route so I'm so proud of them okay we
are almost done I just have to pick
which lip color I'm going to use these
are all brand new to me and I don't know
I don't know what to do
I have Lolita by Kat Von D and this is
just like a classic amazing lipstick and
I actually had lost mine that I used to
have and then I spot a new one so I'm so
happy about that I also have two
hourglass lipsticks these are the I
don't know what they're called they
don't have any name on them but I have
the shade achiever and influencer and
they're just these really pretty like
lip crayons these look like very similar
shades I also have these two wise al
colors I've never owned anything from
wise oh I have the number 16 and the
number 7 and these are their matte
stains I don't know I don't know what
color to use I feel like I should use
one of these cuz these are like the most
interesting I feel like should I just
try it out I'm kind of nervous okay
which color should I do good cooler or
this color let's just go with this one
and if I think it's too boring out put
the other one
this applicator looks so strange but I'm
kind of digging it let's see hmm well it
went on really nicely but I don't know
if it's like something so special um
probably just because I got a very basic
shade maybe I'll put the other one on
top to see what a brighter color looks
like okay so that is what the tulip
colors look like mixed together they are
very pretty they haven't dried down yet
so I don't know if they're gonna dry
down completely Matt but I think that
they're cute wait oh I got a do setting
spray I'll just use this one cuz it's
right I'm gonna set my face so
everything meshes together this is the
finished makeup look I loved all the
products that I tried and also the
products that I knew I was gonna love so
I really like how this makeup turned out
