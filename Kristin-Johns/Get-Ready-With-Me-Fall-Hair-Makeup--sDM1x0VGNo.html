inspired hair and makeup look for you
guys I am just really excited for fall
because let's just think about it the
weather gets crisper you can start
carving pumpkins and having pumpkins
everywhere you can have some pumpkin
spice lattes which I don't think I've
ever had not this but I heard those are
really good and um
the leaves start to change if you live
somewhere besides Florida and I know I
just think that fall is probably one of
my favorite seasons so I decide to do a
fall hair makeup look to get us a little
pumped for fall and so if you want to
see this look it's really easy and the
hair is really easy so if you want to
see how I did it just keep watching so
the first thing I'm going to start by
doing is my foundation and I actually
just got this from Sephora and it's the
Make Up For Ever HD stick and I've
actually really been liking it so I just
put that on with a brush where ever I
need some foundation okay now that
foundation is done I am going to do
concealer I'm going to use the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I'm just
going to put that under my eyes and
anywhere else I need a little bit more
coverage and I'm just going to blend
that in now that I'm done blending all
my concealer out now I'm going to set it
all with a powder and I'm going to use
um Mac Studio Fix and just use a fluffy
brush to set
now I'm going to be using this cool low
benefit bronzer just to warm up the
faith little bit okay now bronzer Sun so
I'm going to be using this blush now and
this is by Mac and it's called warm soul
and I figured this is a great blush for
the fall because calm looks like a fall
leaf when you said I take this on a
blush brush and put it on my cheeks and
this blush is kind of nice
or actually it's really nice because it
already has kind of a shiny to it so um
you don't really need a highlighter but
you can still use one if you want and
now a face is done so I'm going to move
on to my eyes which is my favorite part
so I start by priming my eyes since I'm
going to be using a little bit more
eyeshadow today
now I'm gonna take my lorac oh-oh-oh
lorac unzipped palette and I am going to
just take this brown color and put it in
my crease and do the same thing to your
other eyes and now that you have your
transition color then I'm going to use
the prettiest thing ever this is max
pigment and tan I feel like this is the
perfect eye shadow for fall because it
is so warm and nice so I'm just going to
take a little bit and plop that on my
lids
on your lips we're done with our lid
color and now we're just going to go in
with this color from the lorac unzipped
palette this um warm matte red oh yeah
this color right here just to deepen up
the outer V a little bit now we're just
going to take a big fluffy brush and
blend it all up oh I'm going to do some
eyeliner and I'm just gonna do my
regular liquid eyeliner that I do every
single day next I'm going to curl and
coat my lashes and some mascara I am
gonna do my eyebrows I never do my
eyebrows I'm going to use this powder
and a little angled brush and just fill
them in a little bit
last but not least I'm going to be using
this lipstick from Revlon called velvet
rip rose yeah Roosevelt it and I feel
like this color is perfect for fall and
it's really cheap so that's great okay
so now I'm going to do my hair and I'm
going to use this and this is the
titan-3
collection from nume they have three
different sizes so there's a small one a
medium one and then a bigger one so I'm
going to be using the bigger one this
one gives like loose waves but I really
like it because it still keeps the crow
all day I'm going to be using this today
and just curling my hair regularly just
taking pieces about this big and just
wrapping them around and with this one
you do not have to hold it very long
because it gets really hot so you really
love this one so you just get loose
waves like that oh and I almost forgot
to say um new me was so nice and said
will give you discount codes for all
your subscribers so if you guys are
needing a new curling wand or it's
really long just isn't cutting it I have
coupon codes and so there's two
different ones there's one for 40% off
the whole site and one for $100 off your
order so I will put those in the
description box below but guys that is a
really good deal cuz honestly the best
curling iron I've ever used and I
wouldn't just say that and once I finish
curling my hair all the way I just like
to run my fingers through it to kind of
separate it a little bit I'm just gonna
put it up and a half up half down and
this is just a really easy hairstyle um
if you want your hair out of your face
but you still want it down just pull it
all up and a hair tie
and then I kind of cinch it up at the
top and pull some little hairs down and
then that's a really easy hairstyle if
you're um if your hair is a little bit
greasy or you just want it all out of
your face then I always just do this
because then you still can have your
hair kind of down kind of up so it's
like the best of both worlds okay guys I
hope you liked this makeup and hair for
the Fall I hope that you guys are also
as excited for Falls I am because I am
really excited for the weather start
getting a little bit colder because it's
still about 90 degrees in Florida so um
