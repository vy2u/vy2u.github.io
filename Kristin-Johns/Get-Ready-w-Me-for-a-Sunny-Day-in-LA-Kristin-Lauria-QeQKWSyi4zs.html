along with me
while I get ready for the day so the
first thing I'm going to be doing is
putting on some chapstick I'm using the
Korres lip butter and quints today and I
love this stuff so much the next thing
I'm going to be doing is putting on my
foundation I'm going to be using the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation I'm going
to be blending this all over my face
with my damp Beauty Blender and this
shade is actually a little bit too light
for me right now
but I actually went out today and bought
a new foundation that I'm going to be
trying so I'll let you guys know how
that works out now I'm going to be using
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I'm
just going to be putting this anywhere
that I want to cover up a little bit
more so underneath my eyes and around my
nose where I usually get a little bit of
redness now I'm taking the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and this is just
going to be the powder I use to set my
face so I'm going to be putting that on
my damp Beauty Blender and I'm just
going to be popping that underneath my
eyes and also all around my face and
this will just make sure that my
foundation doesn't go anywhere
throughout the rest of the day now I'm
going to be taking NARS Laguna bronzer
as you can see I love this bronzer a
whole lot and I'm just going to be
putting that underneath my cheekbones
also on my forehead and underneath my
jawline just to bronze up the face a
little bit and I'm going to be taking a
bigger brush and I'm just going to be
bronzing up my neck as well now I'm
going to be taking my new favorite blush
this is tarts at Gio Tay I think that's
how you say it but I'm not really sure
and it's just a really nice peachy pink
blush and now I'm going to be filling in
my eyebrows using the Anastasia brow
powder in soft brown and I'm going to be
using that on an angle brush just to
fill in any sparse spots in my eye brows
now I'm just going to be setting them
with a clear brow gel to make sure they
don't go anywhere throughout the rest of
the day now I'm going to be taking Mac's
all that glitters I shadow and I'm going
to be putting that on my eyelids I love
this eyeshadow so much I just think it's
perfect for everyday
and then I'm going to be putting a
little bit of wood winked on the outer
corner of my eyes just to give a little
bit more of a bronzey look to my
eyeshadow today now I'm going to be
taking a fluffy brush with some Mac cork
on it and cork is just a really perfect
transition shade and this will just give
my eyes a little bit more dimension now
I'm taking a fluffy brush with Mac's
Blanc type or Blanc type I'm not really
sure but I'm just using that as my brow
bone highlight today
now I'm taking Mac's embark and I'm just
going to be using this as my eyeliner
because I forgot my eyeliner at home so
I don't have any here in LA so I've just
been using this as a substitute for my
eyeliner and it just gives a nice
natural look while still defining your
eyes a little bit more now I'm just
curling my eyelashes and putting a
little bit of the benefit roller lash
mascara on the top lashes as well as my
bottom eyelashes I'm also going to be
highlighting today using the Anastasia
glow kick and I love this highlighter so
much and I'm just mixing a few of the
shades and putting it on my cheekbones
my nose my Cupid's bow for lipstick
today I'm using Mac's
C sheer lipstick and this is a really
pretty
Coralie like strawberry pink color I
just love it so much and then on top of
that I'm using buxom z' dolly lip gloss
and this lip gloss makes your lips
tingle and feel really cold so I feel
like it's perfect for summertime now I'm
just popping in a headband into my hair
i curled it how I always do and that is
pretty much it for my hair and makeup
now for my outfit my shoes are from
Nordstrom my dress is from Urban
Outfitters I'll link those both below
