that noise is this biscuit licking my
pillow why do you do that
biscuit hey miss Nick don't like my
pillow please hey guys today I'm going
to be showing you how I get ready for
school in the morning and it's really
fast it's really easy and I know a lot
of you guys are in high school or
college like me so I figured that this
might be helpful for a lot of you guys
so if you want to see how I get ready in
the morning before school then just keep
watching so the first thing that I like
to do in the morning before school is
put on some aqua 4 and aqua 4 is just
like an amazing chapstick you can really
use it anywhere but I like to put it on
my lips the next thing I like to do is
take my foundation I usually just use
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I
have been using this foundation for so
long and I've never found another
foundation that I like as much so if you
guys have any recommendations for
foundations that would be amazing the
front of my eyes I'm using the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and I'm just going to put that
underneath my eyes and also just
anywhere else that I need a little bit
of extra coverage and then I'm just
going to take my Beauty Blender and
blend that all out so now to set
everything I use the Laura Mercier a
translucent powder with my Beauty
Blender and I just set my whole face
even underneath my eyes with it so today
for bronzer I'm going to be using the
morphe e 2 and the mac mineralize
skinfinish in medium dark and this is
actually a face powder but I got it in a
darker color so that I could use as a
bronzer and it just gives a really
natural look it goes on super fast and
it's easy to blend so it's perfect for
school day so for blush today I'm using
tarts blush and expose and this is just
a really nice natural color for my eyes
today I'm just going to be using this
palette by Stila it's called mine I
think that's the name of the palette but
it's just a bunch of matte eyeshadows
and I've been using this
tongue lightly so I'm just going to take
this cream color and put it all over my
lid then I'm just going to take this
matte brown shade and put that in my
crease there's a helicopter outside and
today I'm not going to be using any
eyeliner I'm just going to be curling my
eyelashes and putting on some mascara
I'm going to be using lipstick Queens
perfect wave today and lipstick clean is
sold online at Ulta and they're so good
so I'll link this one down below if you
guys are interested but this one's just
a really pretty coral this one's just a
really pretty coral pink shade and I
love it and I think the packaging is so
cute
okay so the last thing I'm going to do
is my hair and I normally don't have
very much time to do my hair in the
morning before school but I just got
this wand by new me and it is so good it
heats up so fast
and you don't have to hold your hair on
it for very long at all so I can
probably curl my hair in about five
minutes so that's pretty good for me and
it also came with a straightener in this
little case and also a little comb in it
and nuni was nice and half biscuit and
knew me was nice enough to give me a
discount code so if you want the wand in
the straightener you can use the code
kristan for new me and also you can use
the code love Kristin for anyone for $49
plus free shipping so I thought that was
really nice that they gave us a coupon
code for that so I will take bigger
pieces like this and just wrap around
the wand and hold it for a few seconds
and then I just go around my whole head
and do the exact same thing
okay guys that is about it for how I get
ready in the morning for school it
usually takes me about 15 minutes to do
my hair and my makeup and then I usually
just throw on like a t-shirt like this
and some good old workout pants I hope
