Day I'm not uploading this on
Valentine's Day but today really is
Valentine's Day and I figured I should
probably put on some makeup just because
it is Valentine's Day so I think today I
want to kind of do like a bronzy pink
makeup look I actually pulled out a
bunch of like older products from my
makeup collection just ones that I used
to really love and use a lot that I
haven't used in a while and I'm also
going to be using some brand new
products so it's just gonna be a fun
time so I'm gonna start with this this
is the Too Faced hangover RX primer I
kind of jump around to a bunch of
different primers but I always come back
to this one especially when my skin is
feeling really dry
um so I'm just gonna put that everywhere
and I'm going to be mixing together two
different foundations
I'm only mixing them together because
I'm not sure if this one is like warm
enough for my skin tone so this is the
it cosmetics bye bye foundation full
coverage moisturizer and I'm also going
to be using the Too Faced Born This Way
I have the shade neutral tan in this one
let's just see if this is my color I
actually think this might be good hmm
it's not warm enough I don't think I'm
almost out of my Too Faced Born This Way
which is very sad this is like the only
foundation that I consistently run out
of all the time and I actually got to go
to Disney for the launch of this new
foundation from a cosmetics and we kind
of got to learn a little bit more about
this foundation and just hearing about
all of the things that go into making a
foundation just like like the different
types of SPF and like the clinical
testing that goes into it I was just
like well it just really makes you
appreciate the people that are making
all of these products and like trying to
make it the best that they can be okay
and for concealer I kind of wanted to
use a different concealer than I know
we use let me go see if I can grab one
I'm going to use the Too Faced Born This
Way concealer I mean the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation is my favorite
foundation I don't know why I haven't
really tried the concealer that many
times kind of weird I think that this
concealer is a little bit wider coverage
than the Urban Decay one that I usually
use The Naked skin but this one is like
super hydrating which I really like I'm
going to be using the same powder that I
always use this is the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I love this
powder for so long but when I was home
in Florida and I did one of my best
friend's makeup for her wedding and I
did all of the bridesmaids makeup I used
this powder on all of them and some of
them have like super super oily skin and
everyone's makeup looked so good even
after like dancing and like a super long
day of like pictures and everything I
was like wow this powder is like a
miracle I'm going to be using the Tarte
bronzer and hotel heiress it looks like
this I'm honestly not really sure if I
have used this before I feel like I have
cuz it looks a little bit used but I
can't really remember but it looks like
a really nice bronzer let's see how this
looks it also I think it smells good but
I also I can't tell Oh guys this has
honestly never happened to me before but
look it's like it's not blending out
right there what the heck that's never
happened in my whole life that's so
strange the Beauty Blender kind of fixed
it books making me nervous
let me know if you've had the same
problem with that very interesting but
I'm just gonna use my trusty it sunshine
and a compact and see if that works
better
I'm gonna be using Mac's gentle blush
it's just a really pretty like show
shimmery purple pink color I love this
color I feel like this is the perfect
Valentine's Day blush I love this I
keep this in my makeup bag to keep easy
for a highlighter I'm going to be using
this from the balm but this is the mary
lou manizer but i'm going to be using
this on a NARS brush that I just got
it's like the strangest little brush but
I love it and I'm just gonna put a
little bit of that this this highlighter
is so pigmented I'm gonna be very
careful Wow beautiful and I'm gonna be
using the Anastasi a soft brown brow
powder and my eyebrows just a little bit
and this is something that I had never
tried before but I am so in love with
now this is the benefit 24-hour brow
center and I just used it for the first
time yesterday but I loved it so much so
I'm excited ease it again today and this
has like a little paddle brush I don't
know if you can tell but it's like
skinny fat and it makes your eyebrows
look so fluffy like I feel like the
Anastasio one does really good at kind
of like laying all your brows down in
the same direction but this makes your
eyebrows look so like natural and furry
and I wanted to try something different
today I've never used this palette
before this is the Too Faced white peach
palette it has all these really pretty
like perfect for Valentine's Day colors
I'm just gonna start with this light
peach cream shade and put that on oh
whoa that's way lighter than I thought
it would be oh oh I almost just dropped
this huge mirror that would have been
horrible I think you guys in a little
bit more so hopefully you can see a
little bit better but now I'm going to
take the shade peach suede I'm gonna try
to do like a really pinky look a little
bit out of my comfort zone but I'm gonna
take that see how it goes
woah these shades are way lighter than I
think they are okay
I feel like this palette would be good
for someone
with paler skin than me because I don't
know if you can tell let me turn this
light down a little bit but the shades
just look very not chalky but just a
little bit like too pastel for my
skintone okay I'm gonna use two
different palettes but these are both
like throwback palettes so it's still
happy this one is the lorac pro I
haven't used this in forever but I love
this palette and I also have the Too
Faced natural eyes palette it's gonna go
in with the shade mauve from this
palette hopefully this works better I
feel like you couldn't really even see
those shadows on my eyelid looks nicer
then I'm going to take this little
shader brush with some fix plus I just
sprayed that on my cheek and just spray
that a little bit to dampen it and I'm
gonna go in with the color gold let's
just go with a gold look today wasn't if
you pink but gold is pretty too now I'm
gonna line on my upper lash line with
some liquid eyeliner and put on a little
bit of mascara for mascara I actually
used the new benefit one that this is
the bad gal bang mascara and I am
obsessed with this if you love like big
clumpy not clumpy but really like
voluminous lashes you will love this
I've been using this every single day I
think I'm gonna be using oh this is no
this is a little bit too maybe this can
be my base I think I'm going to use this
because I kind of want more like a nude
lip I think this one is in the shade
influencer so I'm just gonna put some of
this on top okay so that is it for my
Valentine's Day makeup I love how it
turned out I especially love this
highlighter so much and I'm gonna keep
using it like every single day
I can't believe that I stopped using it
for so long it's so pretty but now I'm
going to show you guys my jewelry that
I'm gonna wear in my outfit I'm gonna be
wearing some new things that I got from
rocksbox rock spots it's basically a
jewelry membership service and it kind
of takes away like the hassle and the
pressure to buy a new jewelry because
you don't have any obligation to keep
what they send you but you also have the
option to buy the jewelry that you
really really love so I'm going to show
you guys what I got in this month's box
each month by the way is twenty one
dollars and that fee it goes towards any
jewelry purchase that you do make which
i think is really cool so when you open
it up it looks like this it comes
packaged really cute with your three
pieces in there and each of the pieces
is styled to go together so you can wear
all three of these at the same time so
this is the first thing that came this
looks like a little gold cuff so here's
what the cuff looks like on I think it's
so cute and I love that it's super
simple this is from the brand Ginni bird
and this is the moonsong cuff and gold
and let's see it what else we have in
here this is from the brand rudiment and
this is the Marlowe pendant and gold oh
my gosh this is so pretty
see if I can do this no one's help so
here is what the necklace looks like I
think it's so cute and dainty and simple
and the last thing in here is from
kinder scott you should actually be
really pretty layered together so i'm
gonna do that i think that they are so
pretty and like I said the stylists
actually pick out boxes that you can
wear all the jewelry together so I feel
like that's why all these go so
perfectly and if you guys are interested
in rocksbox you guys can get your first
month free by using the code of Kristin
John's ex lx0 over at rocksbox comm and
I'll also post a link down below so you

off the video by showing you guys my
outfit so my shirt is from Urban
Outfitters it's so adorable I love how
it's like scrunchie and then goes into
like roughly right here and I just got
this on
so I'll link it down below because I
know they definitely still have to have
it and then my pants are these these are
like big like 90s long jeans and I'm
kind of in love with them I'll stand on
a chair so you can see them better but
they're super comfy and cool feel like

my outfit okay guys so that is it for
