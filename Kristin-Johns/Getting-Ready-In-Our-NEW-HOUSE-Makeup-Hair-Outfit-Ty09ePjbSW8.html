this is the first video that I'm filming
in our new house this is our bedroom and
it's really have any furniture in it yet
since we only moved in like three days
ago but we got March his old mattress
here which I'm sitting on and the boxes
in the background that still need to be
unpacked but once we do start getting
some furniture
I'll definitely view some room tours or
house tour or something like that so
definitely that's something to look
forward to but today I just wanted to
show you guys how I am going to get
ready for the day and I'll be showing
y'all how I do my hair my makeup and
I'll also show you my outfit so let's
just get started so the first thing I'll
just get out of the way is my hair
because it's going to be very simple
today because I don't really feel like
doing much to it
you all know I just got a haircut it's
way shorter than it was this is just
what it looks like when I take a shower
at night and then wake up in the morning
it's just like pretty straight and like
lips so what I've been doing is using
this this is by the brand dry bar and
it's called triple sec three-in-one and
it says it texturizers amplifies and
refreshes but girl up sephora
recommended this to me and I've really
been loving it so I just shake it up
really hard and then I kind of just put
it in my wrist you're looking for
something that will just kind of like
make your hair more textured and PC oh I
definitely recommend this okay now that
my hair is done that was very easy I am
going to move on to my makeup okay so
for today I'm going to start out with
some primer I don't use primer everyday
I kind of just use it when I'm feeling a
little bit special you know when you
just kind of like want to put a little
bit of extra oomph into your makeup
that's how I feel today so I'm going to
be using the benefit Porefessional
primer which is a really good primer
just kind of smooth out your skin okay
so now I'm going to do with my thumbs
the foundation is the one and only
foundation in my life pretty much
it's the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I use this every day I even
use this when I didn't make it for my
wedding day so that's how you know I
really love it and this is in the shade
warm beige and also on that note I am
going to be doing a um how I did my
wedding day makeup video but I have to
go to Florida to get all of the rest of
my makeup because right now I only have
like this tiny little makeup bag of
makeup because I didn't bring everything
to LA just yet so once I have all my
makeup out here I'll be able to film
that for you guys and I think that that
would be very helpful because I feel
like there's not a ton of those on
YouTube and it's very scary to be your
own makeup on your wedding day so I'll
definitely have that up for you guys
very soon but in the meantime just know
this is the foundation that I used and
it lasted and it looks beautiful with
pictures and it's just my favorite
foundation it's not much more I can say
and for concealer today I'm going to be
using my naked skin that by urban decay
concealer I think really just
fast-forward through the foundation and
the concealer parts on my videos because
you already know what I use and I use
them every day so maybe I'll just skip
through this part really back ok so that
is it for the skin and I'm just going to
set it with my tried-and-true Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I really
like this powder because if I'm really
pale or if I'm can it works both ways
and it doesn't make my skin look ashy if
I am more tanned
which I really like so I'm just going to
put a little bit of that underneath my
eyes and also just all around my face
okay so the next thing I'm going to be
using is bronzer and this is exciting
because I've only used this one time and
I did it really fast so I couldn't
really tell how it looked on but this is
the Marc Jacobs tantrik bronzer in the
shade of tantrik I saw this in Sephora
and I was like that's huge and that was
like a very beautiful color so I need to
try
and this is what it looks like it's just
a really nice shade of like brown it's
just kind of like warm tone but also a
little bit of cool tone so you won't
look super orange hopefully oh I think I
like that that seems very nice it blends
out really easily and it is a very nice
color what's y'all think I think I like
it
it's nice when bronzers have a huge pan
because you can find it's like go
wherever and you don't have to like try
and get in the bronzer when it's really
small so this is nice because just like
oh so easy I think that this bronzer
gets an A+ really the only thing I need
to see is it is this it lasts long but
it's better because this stuff wasn't
cheap for blush today I am tempted to
use my trusty Tarte captivating blush
because I seriously use this blush every
single day but I need to switch it up
because I can't be boring and use same
thing every day and day so I'm going to
use this blush which I also use a lot
this is the Too Faced blush in a school
bloom I'm not sure if they still sell
these exact flushes this is what it
looks like it's just in this really cute
little package and this is the color
it's like a nice of mauve a pink shade
and I think that came out with new
blushes that are in new packaging will
probably have a color similar to this if
you're curious it goes with any makeup
look which I love and for highlighted
today I'm going to be using that there's
a shimmering skin Perfector in the shade
opal which is a very beautiful color I
think this was one of the first
highlighters I ever bought and I use it
a lot and you really can't tell
so this lasts a very long time is what
I'm trying to say and the really good
thing about these becca highlighters is
that they kind of just like sink into
your skin when you apply them even
though they're powder
they really do just like mesh with your
skin you know some highlighters just
look like they're just like sitting on
top of your skin but these kind of like
really
melton which i like okay i'm going to be
doing my brows now which i think is very
boring to watch so i'm going to fast
forward this part but I'm going to be
using the Anastasia brow duo in the
shade soft brown with a little angled
brush
don't think I'm really going to be doing
any eyeshadow today I might just put a
little bit of my bronzer in my crease
because I've been liking like and doing
that lately so I'm just going to put on
a little bit of eyeshadow primer I'm
really struggling my hair is blue right
now
Wow my eyelash extensions are on their
last limb right now they look very um
very sparse but I'm going to be getting
those six tomorrow so don't you worry
okay I assumed you guys in a little bit
and I'm going to be taking some of that
Marc Jacobs bronzer on a little brush
and I'm just going to be putting that in
my crease this is just like a really
easy fast way to give your eyes a little
bit more definition okay so that is
basically it for my face makeup today
and the last thing I need to choose in
which lipstick I'm gonna wear and I have
three new ones to choose from I've used
all three of them but I love all them so
it's really hard to choose I have these
two from Wet n Wild these are there I
think new liquid lipsticks they're
called the mega last liquid catsuit
matte lipsticks and I have the shade
give me milk OTT and also rebel rose and
I wore this one yesterday and I tried
them out on a live Instagram story which
I love doing those and I love talking to
you guys on the live Instagram stories
um but I tried these both and I like
this color better to give me mocha one
and I wore it all day and it was very
good and these are very cheap but I've
really been loving this lipstick from
Tarte it's called vacay I'm not 100%
what these would fix or call but they're
the ones in these like really pretty
marbled blue packages so you so you
really can't miss it when you're asked
for it because it
and really great packaging but this is
what the color looks like it's a really
pretty like dark red mauve color and
it's just just really nice because it
feels very smooth on your lips but also
it kind of has like unmasked satin
finish so I'll show you guys what that
looks like it's very cute okay ready
so this is what the shade of vacay looks
like it makes your teeth look white - I
don't know why maybe because it's like
blue undertone or something um but it's
very very nice and I've been wearing
this a lot again it's kind of like a
matte satin finish which I really like
as well so if you see these X fora just
know I really like the shade they say so
that is pretty much my makeup complete
oh I'm going to do a little setting
spread because I've been doing that
lately I have this tiny bottle of urban
decay D slick and I've been spreading
that on so I just cranked she's praying
and that is so old that I don't even
know if it's if it's healthy to use this
but I still use it so the last thing
I'll show you guys is my my outfit so
let me just stand up and get this all
situated really quick okay so I don't
really know what the best way is to show
you guys my outfit because I don't have
anyone here to help me but I'm just
wearing this little sweater this knit
sweater and this is from American
Apparel and then I just have on this
little skirt which is from whitefox
boutique and it's very cute it's like a
little wrap skirt and I really love the
pattern of it oh one second a tripod and
then my shoes are from Anthropologie and
I can find them I'll link them down
below but they are very comfortable very
cute and they go with everything so I
love that so this is what everything
looks like together I'm not really sure
if you can see it that well but an A for
effort I guess you could say oh and
before I forget I want to show y'all my
nail color because I think it's a very
perfect color for spring this is the
shade mod about you by OPI and it's a
really pretty light pink shade and if
you're looking for a perfect spring nail
polish color this color is very fused so
I just had to share that with you I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video thank you for getting ready with
me this is seriously the makeups I wear
pretty much

products that are new like this bronzer
