still sleeping but today we have such a
fun day ahead of us because well church
first which is fun often we're gonna go
to this very cute farmers market and so
I'll I'll show you guys back because oh
I was obsessed with farmers market so
I'm so excited for that and then later
tonight me and Marcus actually have to
go to this event it's like a pre
streamys event I don't really know but
um yeah I could get all dressed up for
that and go there so I'll show you guys
as well okay so my makeup is done now
I'm gonna show you guys the outfit that
I'm gonna be wearing today cuz it's so
cute it's this little off the shoulder
long like Hingham dress it's from the
brand store X and then I'm just gonna
put it with some white converse and then
we gotta go because we cannot be late to
church Marcus is telling me that I slept
off a bike don't remember at all so I
haven't heard the story so here it is
she always does this when she's falling
asleep for a few hours and I stay up I
was going to bed and I dropped the
charger and it made a really loud clunk
noise Kristen just like she up whatever
she's sleep talk she gets up very fast
so she's sleeping Austin shoes
you know what she started because then
she says what look now you've ruined
everything then after you said there you
go
look I ruin their you ruin everything
you spent
he's got a smiling and then really
seeing new that year sleep tuck that I
was like they're seriously talking up
who your dream what did I ruin you feel
like
started smelling listen you just went
back to sleep he came home and we just
see this and a flower strewn all over
the ground everywhere glass a piece of a
pot broken over here camper just did it
her glasses were broken oh yes was that
just a random no one my glasses were on
the show okay so everything on the Shelf
basically got destroyed so look at how
red this happened it was it was crazy
before we took the plane off the plant
was sideways this was broke the glass
this was broken the freaking what have
you with you
what the heck's this what do you do with
this huh
how did this happen did you break it I
think you broke this I have a feeling
that you broke this it ate it and threw
flowers all over the house how did the
flowers get everywhere huh okay guys so
it is lunchtime and you know what
lunchtime means Kristen cooks for Marcus
no but today I'm forcing Marcus to help
me because I just think he should yeah
so to start off I just want to say thank
you to hello fresh for sponsoring this
video
I love hella fresh I've mentioned them
in a video before and Marcus behind the
camera also loves hello fresh every time
I cook good
she made a hamburger yesterday and it
was unreal I was like what is this
gourmet dude it was so freakin good
yeah the burger so today we are making
spiced dijon salmon with apple arugula
salad and couscous honestly after that
burger anything sounds good you guys
freshness basically it's a meal kit
delivery service so they send you your
fresh ingredients and then they give you
the instructions on exactly how to make
it and you can choose from a classic box
avenging box or a family box and we get
a classic box most of all your
ingredients
we have the arugula the apple for the
salad lemon your favorite marcus oh well
it comes with every individual thing
like a little bit of sour cream a little
bit of that yes I love couscous truly
yeah what my mom used to make couscous
all the time the salmon is cooking this
boy is staring you bloody boy good
Marcus here are the plates that looks
seriously so good or even smart because
they gave me the big piece and me the
small case
yeah that's cuz I'm smart this one
actually took less than 30 minutes 20 20
minutes I'm so excited this we just
finished eating lunch it was so good and
marques actually asked me he was like
how do they make these meals like equal
less than ten dollars but then they also
are super healthy for you and then I
told them it's because hellofresh
actually has two full-time dietitians
that look over all of the food plans to
make sure that you're getting the right
nutrients everything is balanced and
healthy which I think that's one of the
most important things so if you guys are
interested in hellofresh
you can go to hello fresh comm and enter
the code kristan 30 and you can get $30
off your first week of food which I
think that's an amazing deal seriously I
wish I would have known about hellofresh
sooner because it gives me more of an
incentive to cook good meals and it just
makes it so much easier and so much less
like of a daunting task so if you do
want to get their dealers off you can
use my code kristan 30 again and let me
know how you guys like it just
remembered that we didn't go to the
farmers market today and that was one of
my things I was so excited about we just
ended up going to the Grove because we
both needed to get outfits for this this
event that we're going
I'm not even sure really what it is
Marcus basically got a whole new
wardrobe I'm not even joking like cuz we
never go out and shop together so he was
just like okay I'm just gonna buy a ton
of new clothes because I have no clothes
so he got so much stuff but that's why
we didn't go to the farmers market which
is really sad was telling them how you
got a whole new flippin wardrobe today
oh ho nude robe are you so happy to have
new clothes mm-hmm I have to admit I'm
tired this means he wants a back rub are
you kidding me it's the Streamy awards
but for like the technical side of
things I guess like the director
and Marcus looks fly so we're on our
ways actually in Santa Monica so it
all I did we're late to change my makeup
I just left my same old makeup and I
spit on this red lipstick and then some
fake eyelash
and my fake eyelashes this is the first
time that I wore fake eyelashes in a
long time and I don't love it yeah I
like that I'm like used to my natural
lashes now so
beard
Marcus just bought an electric drum set
and he's playing it in the other room
and it's so loud and I keep trying to
vlog but it's so loud so if you hear
that I'm really sorry
oh but we just got home from the event
it was so fun
Marcus's show that he was in called cold
got an award which was so cool what else
happened then I came home and I ate a
Clif Bar for dinner because I did not
feel like making dinner tonight but I
thought that a fun way in tonight's vlog
would be to do a devotion with you guys
um I always like to do my devotions in
the morning with Marcus um but then I
thought it'd be fun to do one with you
guys tonight I have a devotion called
walk with God by Christie green and it's
so good but I cannot find it anywhere so
I'm just gonna read it out of Jesus
calling which I know that probably a lot
of you guys have heard of before maybe
not if not that's totally fine yeah okay
so the way this works is it has a
devotion for every day so let's go to
today's this one says pour all of your
energy into trusting me it is through
trust that you stay connected with me
aware of my presence every step on your
life journey can be a step of faith baby
steps of trust are simple for you you
can take them with almost unconscious
ease giant steps are another matter
all-together leaping across chasms and
semi-darkness scaling cliffs of
uncertainty charging through the valley
of the shadow of death these feats
require sheer concentration as well as
utter commitment to me oh yeah each of
my children is a unique blend of
temperament giftedness and life
experiences something that is a baby
step for you may be a giant step for
another person and vice versa only I
know the difficult mess
if only I know the difficulty or ease of
each segment of your journey
beware of trying to impress others by
acting as if your giant steps are only
baby ones I love that do not judge
others who hesitate and trembling fear
before an act that would be easy for you
if each of my children would seek to
please me above all else fear of others
judgments would vanish as what attempts
to impress others focus your attention
on the path just ahead of you and on the
one who never leaves your side that is
so good okay and then the verses for it
say even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death I will
fear no evil for you are with me your
rod and your staff they comfort me and
that's Psalms 23:4
the thing that really stuck out to me is
when it said beware of trying to impress
others by acting as if your giant steps
are only baby ones and I think that is
so hard to do sometimes and it's hard
also to look at other people who seem to
just have their whole life totally
figure it out and to kind of just feel
like less than because you're comparing
yourself to them think that that's just
such a good thing to live by is like
don't just act like everything in your
life is perfect and that you're just
doing all these humungous things like so
easily and put on this fake facade to
kind of try to fool others like just be
real with people and say like this is
what I'm struggling with and have people
in your life that you can be completely
honest with and also if you're looking
at other people doing all these things
that maybe you feel like you could never
do just don't compare yourself to them
because you don't know what other people
are actually going through and
everyone's journey is so different
everyone is gifted with totally
different paths of life different gifts
different strengths and weaknesses and
life experiences like it said but this
book is seriously amazing I know it's so
popular but it's super popular for a
reason because just the way they word it
really connects with you and also I love
how they incorporate scripture in it as
so if you're looking for a great
devotional I would definitely recommend
Jesus calling I love you guys so much I
hope that you had a great day if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel for new videos every single week
