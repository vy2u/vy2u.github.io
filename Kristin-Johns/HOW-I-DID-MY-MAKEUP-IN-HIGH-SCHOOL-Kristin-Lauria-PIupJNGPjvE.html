having to go back to high school and
then I wake up from those nightmares and
I'm very happy hey guys today I am so
excited about this video because I think
that this is one of the most fun tags
that I've seen here on YouTube so today
I am going to be doing the how I did my
makeup in highschool tag and high school
I remember high school very very easily
because it was only about four years ago
that I was in high school so I was
looking through all of my makeup to try
and figure out what makeup I worn high
school it was still kind of hard to
remember what exact products I used in
high school even though it wasn't like
so long ago but I actually found a lot
of the exact products that I used in
high school like not even replacements
like these still same exact product that
I used in high school so to start out I
went to a private Christian school for
high school and we obviously had
uniforms I don't still have any of my
uniforms from high school those are long
gone and pretty sure I burned them but I
did have to wear like plain blue or
white or green I think like t-shirts or
collared shirts so I figured this would
kind of symbolize the uniform and then
every single day for my hair I would pin
back this side of my hair no joke every
single day pretty much and then I would
go like that to make it a little bit
puffier and this is how I did my hair in
high school sophomore to senior year I
pretty much did my makeup exactly the
same I would either wear no makeup to
school or I would wear this makeup so
the first thing that I would do is take
this powder this is actually a
replacement one because I still use this
sometimes but I would use this exact
powder from Mac it's the Studio Fix
powder it looks like this and it comes
with a little sponge right here and I
have the shade NC 35 this is the shade
that I wore in high school and I would
take that on the little sponge and I
would put that all over my face so I
would just take it and this
is full coverage in high school I was
just like oh my gosh this is the best so
easy but I'm pretty sure this is not
good for your skin it was kind of like
you couldn't really mess up with it so I
really love that about it and then for
concealer every single day in high
school I used the same concealer
underneath my eyes it was Mac moisture
fix or Moisture Surge or Mac oh I don't
remember the exact name but I used that
all time I don't have that anymore and
this one is pretty much similar and I
just wanted to show you guys what I did
and I would just put this underneath my
eyes like this and then I would just
blend it out with my finger I had always
seen my mom and my sister doing this
with concealer even though I didn't
really have dark circles in high school
I was always like I got to do this
because I know that my mom and sister do
it so it must be like what real ladies
do so after I had concealer to cover up
my non-existent dark circles I would do
my bronzer and I still have the exact
same bronzer that I used in high school
so it looks like this it's NARS Laguna
and I would take it on this exact brush
which is the Mac 150 I think it's kind
of like rubbed off but I've had this
brush it's like my freshman year of high
school so I would use this and I would
go all in it and I would just put that
all over my cheeks I kind of did the
same thing that I still do today I would
just put it all like in the hollows of
my cheeks and all on my forehead I kind
of just put bronzer everywhere I had no
idea what the heck contouring was I mean
some people started doing contouring
when they're at like senior year high
school but I was always quite scared of
contouring so I would just bronze up my
face I'd make sure to bring it although
my neck and I don't know if you can tell
but this brush sheds like crazy every
single day I feel like someone would be
like you have like a weird black hair on
your face and I'd be like oh that Mac
bronzer brush really always gets me and
then after
I would be done with my bronzer I would
take the same math 150 brush and I would
use this blush from Mac guys I can't
believe I still have this blush I put it
in a blush palette awhile ago but it's
this one right here as you can tell I
used it a lot
it's called shy beauty I think it was a
limited edition color from Mac but this
is the exact blush I use every single
day all through high school so I would
take that on the same brush it's really
just like a really super light slightly
shimmery blush it's not that good I
don't think it barely showed up with my
skin and that's what I liked so I'd put
that all over my cheeks and then after I
was done with blush I wouldn't do
anything else to the rest of my face I
would brush through my eyebrows I
remember I had this like spoolie brush
that I stole from my mom I think but I
just never thought to ever fill them in
because I always pictured people that
filled in their eyebrows to be people
with like those like Sharpie old lady
eyebrows so I was like I am never doing
that then I would take this I would take
this eyeshadow this exact one from Stila
it's called kitten it's actually a
really nice eyes shadow it's super super
pigmented and I would take it on my
finger and I would put it all over my
eyelids very very shimmery but I would
take it and put it all over my eyelid
and I would also put it in the inner
corner but I wouldn't take it above my
eyelid I would kind of just leave it
like that and then blend in with my
clean finger I remember loving this
eyeshadow so much in high school I just
thought it was the prettiest most
amazing eye shadow ever and I remember
saving up any money I had and spending
it on like this $20 eyeshadow and I was
just so in love with it and I also
remember in high school I absolutely
loved winged
liner I wear every single day day that I
wore makeup so I always used the same
eyeliner I still use this eyeliner today
it's the Physicians Formula eye booster
in ultra black and I remember in high
school I wasn't the best at wings
I really wasn't but I still tried I just
remember I would try to do wings and it
would just always end up looking way
thicker than I wanted it to look
I remember my wings would be so thick
and I knew I knew in my heart that it
didn't look good but I still did it I
still did it and these wings sure as
heck are not even but that's okay
because they sure as heck weren't even
in high school after my eyes were done
pretty much the last thing I had to do
was my lips and I remember so clearly
every single day in high school I would
use the same lip gloss and it was called
balmy nights and if you guys remember
balmy nights please comment below
because balmy nights is my jam it was
from Victoria's Secret and it was just
this super super glossy clear lip gloss
and it smelled like mint and I wore it
every single day in high school I don't
have balmy nights anymore sadly but I
found this which is just like a clear
lip gloss that will have to do in high
school I always just believed the glossy
or the better so I would really pile on
the gloss and then I did a weird thing
that my sister taught me I don't know
why we did this but we did not want our
lips to look red at all because both of
our lips are pretty red naturally so we
would take our concealer and put it over
our lip gloss I don't know why just to
make our own like nude lipstick I guess
it's a very weird stage in our lives so
this is the final makeup I wore in high
school
it's so weird looking in the mirror
because I can remember so vividly
looking like this every single day high
school wasn't the best time in my life
at all I dealt with a ton of anxiety I
dealt with just a ton of stuff in high
school that I did not enjoy very much
but I do have some good memories of high
school so it's just weird to look at
this makeup because anybody would vouch
for me this is the makeup that I wore
every single day and yeah so I really
hope you guys like this video I know
that this isn't like the most wild
makeup ever but it is way different than
the makeups that I do now so I really
love you guys don't forget to subscribe
for new videos every single week and
