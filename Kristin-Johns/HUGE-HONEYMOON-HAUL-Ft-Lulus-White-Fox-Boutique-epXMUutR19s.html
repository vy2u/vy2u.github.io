clothes that I got for my honeymoon it's
coming up very soon new markets are
going to see G and New Zealand so I knew
I wanted to get some new cute clothes to
wear for my honeymoon so I got all of
these clothes from Lulu's calm and white
box boutique they're both amazing stores
I had never bought anything from white
box before but this store is now when my
favorites is so so cute so I'm very
excited to show you guys what I got I'll
start with white socks because I got a
few more items from them than I did from
Luis so I'll do we lose after I show you
what I got from white box and I'm so
excited because all the clothes are so
cute but I will be trying on all the
clothes so you can see how they stick
and I'll be telling you all the sizes
that I got so yeah looks good so the
first thing I got were a couple of
senses because we are going into very
tropical locations I knew we would be on
the beach and in som suit a lot of times
so I wanted to get a couple and the
first one I got is this blue one piece
and it has a really low back and it's
just it's so cute I think that the shade
on the website is called like bubblegum
blue which is just it's so true like
this is such a cute like happy bubblegum
color and I got this in a size small and
it fits very well and it's just super
cute and it's super comfortable I used
to hate one pieces like if I ever had to
wear a one-piece toucan for anything I
was like no but now I'm really starting
to love one pieces so I knew I wanted to
get a new one for the honeymoon and I
also got one more sub suit and this one
is navy blue with some gold detailing
and then the back looks like this it's a
little bit like criss cross but it's
very very flattering on then these are
the bottom I also got this one in a
small and it's perfectly and I'm just so
excited to wear these I get so excited
when I get a new sub suit because I feel
like I don't really buy some suits very
often the next thing I got you could
wear as pajamas or you can just wear it
around the house or just like for chill
day
and my favorite kind of clothing so I
got these little shorts and they're just
like little athletic shorts they have a
drawstring and they're stretchy and
they're kind of like a thick cotton
material and then I also got some little
top to go with it I think white is my
favorite clothing color because I seem
to get everything in white so I really
love these and I must say I got both of
these and an extra small the next thing
that I got is so so cute I love this
dress so much it's this dress it's white
with some blue like geometric patterns
and some flowers kind of flares out at
the bottom and it has this really pretty
like keyhole neckline in the front and
then it goes around your neck like this
and this dress fits so well I'm so
excited to wear this I just I love it so
much it's so unique and beautiful and
then I also got this sweater which is
like a can and white color and it has a
cool pattern it has like the can here
with a little triangle down front and
then it has some meshing right here
which is super cute and I love how it
does past your butt so you can wear it
with leggings and I just love a
statement I always like to wear sweaters
even when it's like at 80 degrees
outside so I'm so I'm going to be
bringing this on the honeymoon the next
thing that I got are some did I'm shorts
let me button them up so you can see
what they look like they're these really
cute distress I like acid-wash jeans I
think that's what you call them but
they're so cute they're high-waisted
they have little patches or a little
holes in them which i think is really
cute and I just love pairing like
distressed in them with sweaters or
little tops I think that they're really
cute they're just like a little staple
to have and I love you so much and
they're very very comfortable as well so
lumpy next up is this little olive green
romper which i think is so dang adorable
I love it so much I got a stuffing I
love it because I really do love
everything
but it has a little rap over here it
wraps around your front you'll be able
to see it better once I put it on but
it's just very very cute it's very
flattering it's a very beautiful color
it has a little zipper best here I got
this in the side extra small and it fits
perfectly and it's just very very very
nice I also got this sweater which is
this really pretty like dusty pink rose
purple color um and I also got it in
this color which I'm wearing right now
it's just gray
I like how sloppy they are because you
can wear them like just like regular or
you can wear them off the shoulder Asian
put a little bra lit with them these are
just all-around great staple pieces and
like I said I love sweaters love to wear
them and wear them all the time
I was really feeling the
off-the-shoulder trend I wore that
really pretty like lace off the shoulder
dress for my bridal shower and ever
since then I've been loving off the
shoulder things I don't know why it's
just something that I've really been
loving so I got this off the shoulder
romper and has a little bow in the front
it's this beautiful red color I totally
would have worn this for Valentine's Day
as much as would have been in town for
Valentine's Day because it's just so
perfect I know that I'm going to be
wearing this a ton on a honeymoon
because it's just so cute it's like
flirty and romantic and I just love this
this is definitely one of my favorite
things that I got and I'm so happy that
it fits so well I got this in a size us
two I also bought another romper I
really want romper crazy because I just
love them I think they're very cute and
they just switched up a little bit from
the normal dress you know what I'm
saying so I got this one it's a
beautiful rusty orange color and it goes
like this and it's just very simple it's
very flattering I got this one in a six
Australian size six I don't really know
how to say that I think it's just
Australian sy6
but I love this one so much and it's
just cozy and comfy and easy and love
that all my few more things from
whitefox the thrifting is this little
off-the-shoulder
white top and like our
saying I love off-the-shoulder things so
I put this in my little bag and I think
that this would look really cute with
the distressed shorts that I showed you
all earlier and it's very soft and
comfortable and I got this one in a size
extra small it fits perfect the only
thing is it's a little bit see-through
so I think I would have to wear like a
like a bando or something like that
underneath it but it really is so cute
and I can't wait to wear this to say
like a delicate and dainty and the last
thing from whitefox is this and this is
kind of like a t-shirt dress it's very
very soft again in that like pretty like
olive khaki color and it goes down you
can wear this as I guess a shirt or a
dress but I think I would wear it more
as a dress I really like this it's very
cozy I was actually wearing this last
night just around the house smells like
this is so soft so that is everything
that I got from whitefox and they were
super nice and gave me a 15% discount to
give you guys so if you just put in the
code Kristen at your checkout you can
get 15% off all site-wide so that's very
nice and I hope that you guys check out
some of the stuff because it is
seriously amazing so I love that stuff
but I still have some more things to
show you from Luis so let me grab that
really quick okay so I have my stuff
here from Lulu's you guys know I love
Lou's I've done some calls with them in
the past and they're just the best I
love their clothes I love the quality of
their clothes and they're just awesome I
love them so much and they were super
nice and let me pick out some stuff to
show you guys and it's we're on my
honeymoon so I'll start out with more on
accessory type things because questions
start out with that so I got this a
watch and this is a Woody's watch yeah
what would be not Woody's would be this
is a really beautiful like rose gold
watch and it has a wooden little face I
really wanted a more rose gold like
chain type of watch because the ones
that I have are mainly like leather
bands
and I just want something a little bit
different and I thought that this one
was super super pretty and I also got
this little toaster I've been loving
chokers lately I think that they're
really cute and I think this one's a
little bit different because it's white
and has little daisies on it and I just
thought this was really cute and I just
feel it I don't know I just been loving
chokers lately and I never thought I
would get into the choker trend but I
did as you can see I did the next thing
that I got from Lois is this off the
shoulder and denim dress I got this in a
size small I've been chained dresses
like this on so many different websites
but I feel like they're always sold out
so when I saw this I was like I got to
smash this up did you really see it with
a choker and I think it will be really
cute for like a beach day I just really
like it the next thing that I got is
more of a fancy item I wanted to get
something a little bit more fancy in
case we go it's like a nice dinner or
something like that
so I picked this out and it's this navy
blue floor-length dress and it has a
halter neckline and it's so so beautiful
it has this like crochet overlay or this
isn't crochet like lace and it just
looks so beautiful on I got this in a
size small I probably could have gotten
an extra small so fear about my size I
would go for the extra small but it's
really really pretty on if you're
looking for a dress for a more special
occasion I would definitely recommend
this one because it's beautiful but
comfortable at the same time of which I
really really I really appreciate that I
also got this dress which just makes me
so happy looking at it it's this blue
color it's again off shoulder and it has
buttons going down in the front of it
it's kind of like a mid-calf length so
instead of like a mid-calf length dress
and it's still free this just really
reminds me of something that I was
wearing for like Easter Sunday or
something like that but it's just really
cute it's also very beachy like I can
imagine walking down the beach ringman
so I love this I think it has beautiful
colors I love the white with like the
light blue I think it's so pretty and
last two things that I got from Lewis
are
is and this is the first one it's just
really pretty
I think it's called bodycon dress
deathless it's called when it's kind of
like form-fitting doesn't really know
fashion terms but it has this really
pretty neckline it's kind of like a lace
overlay on it has a really pretty pink
color lining underneath this dress is
very unique and actually looks very good
on so I really like this I got this in a
size extra small and I'm very excited to
wear this and the final thing is that I
have to show you guys I know this has
been a super humungous haul but the
final thing that I have the show you
guys is this dress which I've actually
worn a couple of times I posted a
picture on my Instagram wearing this and
I got a ton of Connor's asked me where
it was from
but it's this white dress with blue
details and it has a little tie in the
back this is just a very sweet like
comfortable dress but it's just very
unique I love the sleeves how they're
kind of bell sleeves and they have like
scalloping almond scalloping she's
calling me up but yeah I just love this
dress so much and I've been wearing it a
ton and Marcus loves this dress so I'm
definitely going to be wearing this on
my honeymoon and yeah so that is the
final thing that I had to show you guys
I love you guys so much I hope that you
