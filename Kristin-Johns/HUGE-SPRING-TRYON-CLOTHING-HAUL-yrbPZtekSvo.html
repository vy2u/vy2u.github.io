clothes to show you guys and I am like
looking at this pile just dreading the
trial session of this because there's so
many new clothes basically I picked up a
ton of new cute things for the spring
and they're from just a ton of different
places like anthropology forever21
what else ASOS Nordstrom like there's a
ton of different places I try to kind of
categorize them by store so maybe it
would make it easier to fall along with
me so I think I'm going to start with
the shoes and the shoes are from all
different places but they're the things
that are sitting on top of wall clothes
right now so I'm just gonna get them out
of the way and the first shoes that I
have here are these by Steven Steven by
Steve Madden and these I picked up from
Lulu's and I just needed some new
sandals for the spring because all of my
sandals were getting pretty pretty ratty
so I picked these up and I really liked
the design of them and the next shoes
that I got are from Urban Outfitters and
they look like this I like these because
I like the texture of them I think that
it's cool that they kind of feel like
fuzzy corduroy kind of and I like the
white outlining detail and I thought
that these would be perfect for spring
with like some cute cutoff jeans and
like a little shirt next to shoes that I
got were kind of a big fat fail and I
wanted y'all's opinion because I'm
really debating on taking these back or
not
well one pair I know I'm taking back
because they are horrible I mean this
pair I'm still debating on and I've
gotten mixed reviews from my friends so
maybe you guys can help me but I ordered
these online from Nordstrom these are
from the brand Sam Edelman and I've been
really wanting some like leather loafers
just to slip on something like super
easy and I got these and I really like
them but the thing is I think they kind
of look like dad shoes a little bit like
I just know my dad would wear these and
they look pretty cute on and they're
really great quality but I just can't
get over the fact they look a little bit
like my dad's shoes so these I'm kind of
on the fence on let me know your opinion
um but I don't know I'm like I'm still
on the fence ease I just paid a huge
mistake these are our definite knows
everyone I showed these are like yeah
you got to take those back but these are
from the brand say shells or seashells
they look like this they're these little
white mules and the thing about these is
they just look like straight-up Grandma
shoes and you know I love myself a good
thrift store find I honestly dress kind
of grandma sometimes but these are like
crossing the line they just look so
grandma on me so I am going to be taking
these act because they were pretty
expensive and that was like a big fail
for me it's like really excited about
them and I put them on I was like okay I
also show you the one swimsuit that I
got and this is probably the thing that
I am most excited for guys I think that
you are gonna love this I already sent a
picture of this swimsuit to one of my
friends and she bought it immediately
because it's just so stinking adorable
so it's this swimsuit it's from ASOS and
I say that and it has flowers on the
front and it has this little tie detail
and then the bottoms are high waisted
and they also tie in the front and have
flowers on there and they are so cute on
they're so flattering and I hope that
they still have this in stock because
this is like my favorite swimsuit I've
ever had and I'm so excited to wear this
now on to the clothing and I'll start
with my thrift store fines because
they're sitting right here next to me
but I first got this little jumpsuit
from the thrift store and it has like
eyelet details it's cream it goes all
the way down into pants I think it's so
cute and perfect for the spring and I
also bought this shirt which I got
pretty much mainly for layering because
I love the way that lace collars look
under sweaters and things
that can you guys even see it's got kind
of prey so that's what this shirt looks
like and I just I love these collars and
the last thing that I got from the
thrift store is this denim bomber jacket
type situation and it's so lightweight
and that's why I loved it right away
but I didn't realize and this has like
stains on it and I already tried washing
it so I might just wear it with the
stains on it but if you guys have any
tips on how to get rid of like 20 year
old stains let me know okay and this
shirt that I got is from Topshop and I
love the bell sleeves this is my
favorite type of neckline like this
halfway turtleneck I just love
everything about this and I feel like
this is the type of sweater that I am
gonna wear at least five times a week
like I just live in these types of
things so I was so happy that I found
this now I'm moving on to anthropology
they were so nice and let me pick out a
few things to send to me and I was like
oh okay because the anthropology
squirrels are like so special and unique
so I got this you're not gonna really be
able to see it but it's like this taupe
flowy skirt and the way that I
envisioned wearing this was like with a
little like graphic white t-shirt with
like some cute boots and I think they
also had this in a red color as well but
I feel like this would also be perfect
like the perfect kind of thing to wear
on Easter and this next dress is
basically the dress of my dreams I loved
it so much and I'm just like savoring it
till the perfect moment to wear it
because it's just beautiful
so I'm not gonna be able to show you the
whole thing because it's pretty long but
it's just this beautiful white dress I
got it in a size zero and it ties at the
waist so you can have some shape and
then I have one thing from ASOS and it's
a maxi dress I actually got this on sale
it's the brand JOA or joah it's just a
long light blue maxi dress in the back
is like cut out and open and yeah I
really like this and I haven't actually
tried this on yet we'll see how it looks
but I think it looks very beautiful I've
been loving the color light blue so much
like I've just been accumulating more
and more light blue things and I just
think that's like my favorite color for
the spring to be honest I don't know if
I love this dress but let me know in the
comments I'm just kind of like it's cute
but it's not like crazy special if you
know what I'm saying okay the next two
items are from forever 21 and they've
had some really cute stuff lately I've
been very impressed wait I actually
thought a swimsuit from there and I
forgot to bring it said one thing this
swimsuit I was talking about from
forever 21 it's a nude one piece and it
has some mesh cutout like on the sides
like down here and up here and I just
feel like this swimsuit looks like it
would be expensive like you could get it
from like Nordstrom or something but it
was only nineteen dollars and it fits
very well so I love that I also got this
shirt and this is just very soft and
comfy I like wearing this type of shirt
around the house and I don't really know
I haven't tried this on yet but I don't
really know what I'm gonna wear under it
maybe just like a little candy because
it's obviously really open right here
and my absolute favorite thing that I
found that forever 21 guys this fits so
well and I'm just I'm just so excited
about this this was 1990 this jumpsuit
fits better than any jumpsuit I have
ever tried I could just keep talking
about this because I'm so excited to
wear it and I'm obsessed with it and the
very last place that I went shopping was
Lulu's and I got a few dresses from them
and this is the first one that I got
it's this beautiful flower dress kind of
like a wrap dress up at the top but then
it's not at the bottom because for some
reason I cannot do wrap dresses they
just do not fit my body at all so I
really like the shape of this because it
kind of
like a wrap dress but it's not guys I
messed up I messed up I said that this
wasn't a full wrap dress but it is and I
can't do wrap dresses they just don't
work on me
so yeah this is not good I also got a
shirt from Lulu's I totally forgot about
this shirt oh my gosh this is so soft
wow this is just perfect every day I
love t-shirts looking for Phyllis hat
I also got this set so this is what it
looks like it kind of looks strange
because it's hanging on the hanger but
basically these sleeves go off your
shoulders and it's a little flower print
and it also comes with the matching
skirt which is just very long and flowy
and I might wear these two together but
I was thinking that this would be cuter
with just like a tied up shirt like
something just white like this and then
this maybe with like a something more
plain I don't know I feel like these two
together might be like a lot but we'll
see how it looks together I haven't
tried this one on yet and then the last
thing that I got I am so excited to wear
this is from Lulu's as well and it's
from the brand lost in wonder I really
thought this looks like something that
you could get at free people I was like
wow this is very special and adorable so
can't wait to wear this sorry if I've
said that after everything but I
honestly haven't gotten a chance to wear
any of this because it kind of all came
in at the same time also it was very
rainy in LA for like a week two weeks
maybe even three weeks and then we went
on that Lake Tahoe trip so I really
haven't had a chance to wear a lot of
like cutie spring things and that is it
for today's video I really hope that you
enjoyed it and I know that you guys love
clothing hauls so I'm gonna try to start
incorporating more in my channel because
