for you my hair routine as well as my
skincare routine and I was reading
through my comments the other day
singing of a new video to some food guys
and I saw a ton of requests for both of
these things but I was hesitant to do it
because I knew each video would be
really really short because both my hair
care routine and my pink hair is really
really simple so I decided I would just
fish the two together into one video and
that's what I'm doing today also can we
talk about how cute this is
are you ready to talk about your skin
and hair care if you have some fur care
tips for us are you gonna help me are
you gonna sleep he's gonna sleep
the first thing we'll start with is hair
start with hair and I'll just start by
saying kind of the background of my hair
I have naturally straight hair and the
last time I dyed my hair was about three
years ago and I got highlights and so my
hair was really really blond but now I
feel like most of it's just my natural
color and maybe some there's some light
lighter parts at the end from my old
highlights so that is my hair oh my hair
gets oily very quickly and that's pretty
much the background in my hair so really
the only thing I use on my hair is my
shampoo and conditioner and I use this
and it's Pantene smoothing shampoo and
Pantene smoothing conditioner and how I
know to get the steps tour is because it
has an avocado on the front and so I'm
like oh my shampoo avocado what so these
are the two that I use and by the way
they're like three dollars they're super
super cheap and I love that
and also they smell so good and so I use
those to shampoo and conditioners since
I said my hair gets oily really fast I
feel like they make my hair stay really
clean for a longer time so I don't have
to wash my hair every day because I read
somewhere that that's not good for your
hair and also like every two or three
months I'll use a coconut
my hair and I just use a scoop of
coconut oil and I just put it from here
down cut like soaking my hair and then
I'll sleep in it wrapped up over tonight
and I feel like that really makes your
hair feel so soft and it really is a
good hair match so that is my hair care
routine so let's move on into my
skincare routine I like to use this to
cleanse it at nighttime and this is the
clean and clear morning burst cleanser
and I have been using this lip JIT since
seventh grade and I've tried other
cleansers but every single time I try a
new one my face always hates it and I
breakout or I get like our rash or
something on my face so that is my
tried-and-true favorite skin cleanser
after I wash my face at night with this
I always use this and this is my
favorite thing in the whole world this
is the Josie Maran 100% pure argan oil
organic moisturizing oil and I use this
as my face moisturizer every single
night and it looks like this oh this is
my favorite part because it comes in a
little thing I feel the scientist when I
use it and I use this and I use about
one to two drops tonight and I just rub
it together and put it all over my face
in my neck and I really love that
moisturizer I really feel like it heals
my skin like whenever I have a breakout
or a spot or something it heals the spot
really fast and it heals the scar so it
doesn't scar and stay there for like
immature for those of you with oily skin
that are probably a little bit nervous
of putting an oil straight on your face
I have to say I thought the same thing I
have like combination skin I have like
some areas in my face are dry and summer
a little bit oily and I was like oh
nothing
and oil on my face because that's just
gonna make me look really oily but
that's not true it's actually made my
skin less oily and my skin has become
more just normal and like not no dry
patches no oily patches so if you have
oily skin do not be scared of using an
oil on your face you could actually use
the white version of this they have the
josie maran argan oil and the light
formula and that would just absorb into
your skin a little bit faster I highly
recommend you guys get that because my
skin has really never felt so healthy
and um I really rarely break out after
I've been using this so I love that is
that my biggest tip for you guys would
be to wash your face every single night
and get a good moisturizer that works
for your skin and that's pretty much all
I don't really use any toners or have
any crazy skincare steps or crazy
products that I use but I think that's
sometimes good because then it can just
be overwhelming to use like a million
different products at night so that is
it I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope that maybe you got some good
recommendations or some good tips thank
you so much for watching this video and
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
up and don't forget to subscribe because
I post a video every Monday I hope you
guys have a great rest of your week and
I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
