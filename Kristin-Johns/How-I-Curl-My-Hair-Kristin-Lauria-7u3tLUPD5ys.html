the video I'm going to be filming
because I've gotten a whole lot of
comments from you asking me how to curl
my hair and that's what I'm doing today
and it's super super easy and fast and I
hope you guys like it and let's just get
started the first things that you're
going to need are a one-inch curling
iron mine is from the brand Hot Tools a
clip mine is purple and I stole it from
my mom and you're gonna need a hairbrush
and also you're going to need some
hairspray and maybe even a little cat to
keep you company
okay so the first thing I do always
before I curl my hair is just brush it
out because my hair gets my hair gets
super tangley like that always then I
take my handy clip and I chop my hair in
half with a finger and then I twist it
up and clip it up just twist it up and
clip it up once your curling iron is
heated up all I do is I take a little
section of my hair about this big and I
point the curling iron down and put it
behind my hair and then I just twirl the
hair all around it and since it's heated
up to the highest temperature I'll hold
it for very long probably only 5 seconds
max and then I let it go and it gives
you nice little curly curl
just twist it twist it and toss it twist
boop context
your whole bottom half of your left side
is done and then you just throw that
behind there and take down your second
half you're just gonna do everything
that you did to the bottom half of it to
the top okay now our first half of our
hair is done and then I usually just
kind of go like this with my fingers a
few times I really know why I just think
it makes it look a little less neat and
we're off to the next side of our hair
and I do the same thing I just take my
handy clip clip it
get a nice hairstyle and then I do
pretty much the exact same thing on the
other side except I hold the curling
iron with my left hand and then I wrap
it away from my face again so I put it
behind my hair and then just twirl it
around the curling iron oh and if you're
in a rush you can just take bigger
pieces of hair and do those and then
you'll have a little bit looser curls
but it'll still be pretty and wavy and
it takes way less time than just taking
a little piece of hair so that's usually
what I do when I'm in a rush
he's lucky he doesn't have to curl his
hair he has beautiful orange hair orange
and white so now we're on our very last
section
so toss that back then you just pretty
much do the same thing that we did to
this back to this part choose the top
part
but these front pieces these front
pieces I do a little bit differently I
usually take this whole thing this whole
chunk of hair and I put the curling iron
behind my head and then I just do it
like that I like hold it so it's
parallel to my head like a George
Washington curl
I feel like this makes it fall a little
bit nicer and frame your face a little
bit nicer if you curl the front piece
like this like where your bangs would be
nice at this point is usually when I run
all the fingers through it ferociously
shake it out and then I take my handy
dandy hairspray guys I've used this
exact kind hairspray since I was a
probably like five then I spray it and
the reason that I like this the reason
that I like this hairspray is that it
doesn't make your hair feel crunchy and
so even after you spray it you can still
run your fingers through your hair and
it doesn't get like stiff like cardboard
or something and that is how I curl my
hair that is all I do if you guys would
like to see any other hairstyle videos
just comment any suggestions down below
and give this video a thumbs up if it
helped you and you liked it there's a
woman to say thank you so much to all of
your sweet comments and y'all were so
encouraging in my last video you all

just made me really really happy and
excited to start this channel and I just
feel like I got a whole bunch of new
friends from doing YouTube last thing
