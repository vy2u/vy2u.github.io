trying on some wedding dresses for you
guys I am NOT getting married again but
I know that it is wedding season right
now and I also know that weddings can be
so expensive I mean I know from personal
experience it's like everything adds up
very fast and I I just realized I'm not
wearing my wedding ring one second okay
Wow I could not feel like a wedding
video without my wedding ring on I took
it off last night to get in the shower
and okay now I feel much better but as I
was saying wedding this can get very
expensive
and I thought that this video might be
helpful because I was scrolling on a
sauce ASOS I always say ASOS but then
people yell at me so a sauce a few
nights ago and I saw that they actually
had wedding dresses which I had no idea
so I was like maybe this could be
helpful for some of my followers that
are engaged right now or looking for a
wedding dress or plan to get married in
the future they were all under $200 I
haven't even opened the bags yet and I
am so excited to see what they're like
and also what I'm kind of one I kind of
want Marcus's opinion on them so he'll
be making a little appearance in this
video as Doug yeah guys Marcus here I'm
chilling backstage right now
Christian's about to come out wearing a
freakin wedding dress and I'm gonna be
like yeah dude and I'm freaking excited
yeah let's just start with this one this
is the only one that didn't come in an
actual box okay this is actually very
pretty okay let me see how much this one
was so this one is the all-over lace
band Oh maxi dress and it was 182
dollars and I was thinking even if
you want to get your actual wedding
dress off a sauce then you could even
get like one of your you know bridal
party dresses there because they have
like pretty cute ones like this is
actually very nice I'll obviously be
trying it on but just from first touch
this does feel very nice and we'll see
how it looks I think you look so good I
have to say something
look I don't think that that wedding
dress does your shape justice it's big
it's not tight-fitting to you and this
kind of like a little wet wet though I'm
saying yeah if it was like that but this
leg makes it look like you kind of look
like a big - right but yeah I was it was
tight and fitted which of course you
would get it right that's what you
always do
now I actually think I would like that
really yeah what I will say is this is
good I think you should wear that it's
like that I'm just going out tank dress
yeah I feel like if you just wanted like
a simple lace strapless wedding dress
this would work yeah absolutely
and it would be kind of like trendy it
like kind of more relaxed like it's not
like a traditional wedding dress but now
you're going for this vibe that it's
like it doesn't matter et tu de do pooty
te did you you look really good this one
actually come in a box that says estas
bride special
Wow this is actually excited about this
actually looks very pretty so this is
called the embellish kami wedding dress
if it is you can't know if you can see
this it's kind of like there's like a
lot of like loose yarn or like strings
all over it which makes it kind of look
a little bit cheaper but it looks like
it would be very very pretty
and it might sound crazy to some people
order your wedding dress online but
that's actually what my sister did she
ordered her dress online off of j.crew i
think it was either j.crew or
anthropology I can't remember um but she
just found one online that she loved and
then she just got it tailored and it
looked perfectly beautiful in her um I
went the more traditional route I got
mine at like an actual wedding boutique
but I definitely didn't go like super
expensive with my wedding dress but also
was not cheap it was like one of the
main expenses of our wedding so if you
found a style online that you love
that's less than $200 I mean I don't -
yeah I think that's just not quite
formal enough really look these are all
my opinions you guys may love all of
these but I I think I like the other one
a lot better I feel like this one looks
in person a little bit like that looks
yeah like the rinds of it I think that
this is just like a homecoming dress you
know you know what this thing the
rhinestones are kind of like
off-centered like they kind of go in
this way more I like the like shape of
it like I think if you bought it fitted
it could be really flattering I'm just
thinking this is your wedding
if you're gonna wear one nice dress in
your whole life you got it we're trying
to figure out yes if you're on a budget
pick the other dress
I personally like the classic white
police thing that you have for your way
that's a way of the same taste yeah
tonight should I be less critical I feel
like I'm being strength I'm being like
yo you really think that I really wanted
to know like someone else's opinion how
wrinkly it is at the bottom yeah but
it's pretty I like the texture of it
like it's very like soft and silly oh
this one looks really nice oh my gosh
okay because I am a sucker for lace my
dress was lace sleeves I'll insert a
picture here if you have it
pictures from right weddings but okay
this one has potential it was a hundred
and ninety-nine dollars it looks very
pretty on the model it has like a really
nice open back but yeah we will be
trying this on we'll see how it goes
like so it's this very like puffy eight
we're here interesting thing going on
here and then in the back is like
completely exposed which I find not part
of the motif of this dress I know and
it's like the most traditional
conservative then the back is like the
spicy back this is actually the first
one with a train which we'll show you in
a second
wait which i think is nice but wow this
one is like puffy
so this is your least favorite yet right
yeah it's just uh my favorite style but
I think that the dresses for what it is
if someone likes it I think it's well
made it looks like really fitting and
adjustable like the puffs from the back
or you look like you have like Hulk
muscles right now you look too active
okay so this one was the least my style
personally dress that I got wait a
second this was supposed to have a oh I
feel it I feel it okay yes so this one
has a little embellished belt that you
can put around it but I don't think I
will be trying this because I'm just not
a huge embellished girl like with
diamonds and stuff so I actually think
this is way prettier without the belt oh
this one was only $90 I think this was
the cheapest one that I found that looks
like a dress you would wear to a red
carpet yeah so I feel like that is uh
like it's less wedding it's less money
but it could be used at a wedding I
think yeah very nice I love the way this
would fit it's like very comfortable you
could dance all night and not feel
that's that's the best dress on you that
I've seen yeah I mean it fits the best
comes with this like silver and diamond
belt if you just want to like a really
simple like fitted dress all night you
dance on guys you can dance all right
check on the ruffles check on the
ruffles here's the back
ooh this one might be my favorite one I
forgot that I got this one this one
looks really nice i I just like I said I
love lace sleeves and then it has more
of like I think this is called tulle
I think that's what it's called has like
a tulle skirt and this one looks very
nice like this one
I feel like looks the nicest out of any
of them I think probably because it's
like most my style I think this one
might have been up there in price
it was 151 and this one wasn't even on
sale the other dress I think was the
best dress number 4 was my favorite
dress this is I think the best wedding
dress yeah this one's not very like
form-fitting well you can also be really
nice though yeah I think they're gonna
like tight in their own ways because I
like very like princessy almost but
still like simple which I like they each
other things for sure but I think my
favorite is for OK in my favorite sister
