different because I just got home from
the haircut lady and I chopped like six
and a half inches off my hair I thought
only five inches but I think it's more
like six inches because it used to be
right down here and I was up here and I
feel like that's more than five inches
but um I chopped my hair off and I'm
going to give you guys a second but I
just wanted to film this video I just
wanted to talk to you guys update you
about my life because I have to be able
well glue because I haven't been able to
just sit down and just talk with you
guys and I feel like a really long time
the first thing I'll talk about is my
hair because that is like a huge change
because y'all know my hair was so long
I'll put in like a little before video
because I didn't pick up before picture
which was really stupid but I'll put in
a little before video to show you guys
how long it was it was very long and I
was just so tired of it I was just like
I can't do this anymore I had to spend
so long brushing it everyday and
basically a bed is brush it for like one
whole day it would turn into like a
dreadlock I am super happy with my
haircut I am sorry I'm going to be
testing at this whole video because I'm
still like getting used to it you know I
think it's really happy because I just
feel more free I'm ready for the summer
my long hair just it was just like a
blah and now I'm in a new place I live
in LA officially now and I was ready for
a change so I'm so so happy with it I
was telling the girl that I was cutting
my hair I was like I am attached to my
long hair it's like a security blanket
for me it really was like I kind of felt
like I said behind my hair in a way like
it was just is this like my security
blanket
I don't know and I never ever cut it
like I think the last time I cut it was
like a year and a half ago which was way
too long it was just getting dead and it
is still past my boobs but it's just so
cute I love how it has so much more
volume and I just don't feel like it's
what
me down like I seriously feel like I
lost 5 pounds when I comes to my hair um
so that is a huge change that I'm so
excited about if you have super long
hair and you're attached to it and you
kind of feel like it's your security
blanket I would say I highly recommend
it chopping it off because I had never
thought I would be in the girl to chop
off my hair but I did it and I feel so
happy and I just feel free I'll show you
guys the back look see it's not super
short but it's way shorter than it was
before when she first did the big first
cut I was like I think I might freak out
I think I might have a little bit of a
panic attack but she was super nice she
was really sweet and she understood my
fears chopping it off and she was just
really nice and helped me through it you
know I'm saying so I chopped off my hair
that is one huge exciting thing that's
going on in my life right now
something else that I was taught you
guys about and just married life I've
been married for almost a month now know
a little bit less than a month since
February 18 so I can't do math on that
but married life is so much fun guys
we've been having a lot of fun just
getting used to being married we took
such a long honeymoon which if you guys
follow me on Instagram snapchat and
Twitter all those spices oh one second
is my sister I'm going to show her my
new hair
but anyways all I'm trying to say is I
love being married it's so much fun and
I want to do a whole video about our
honeymoon because it was so much fun we
went to Fiji and New Zealand and we were
there for five days in Fiji and 10 days
in New Zealand it was so much fun but I
feel like I've gotten a lot of questions
from you guys asking how we planned it
and where we stayed and what we would
recommend doing there and I think that
means really fun video and we have a ton
of videos like on our phones from just
videoing different experiences so I
could include those
in like the honeymoon video so if that's
something that you guys would be
interested in definitely let me know by
giving this a thumbs up or just comment
down below and I'll definitely still mat
for y'all another little life update I
could share with you guys is that we are
in LA now um I am NOT in my house
because we don't have a house yet we are
at my brother and sister-in-laws house
lexing Cody Marx's brother and
sister-in-law and staying at their house
right now with Marcus we're still trying
to find a house it's really really hard
to find the house um we've been trying
for a while now everything is just super
competitive in LA
like when house goes on the market it
goes away just like that so we are
praying a lot so that we find house very
soon but Cody unless he has been so
sweet and they've been letting us stay
here once we have a house it will be a
lot more easy for me to film videos and
be more consistent here on YouTube which
is like my biggest goal but just be
patient because we are really really
trying to find a house and we're going
to have to move all my stuff from
Florida California and it's just going
to be a process and yeah so that is
pretty much if it's going on in my life
right now just newly made looking for a
house I actually have something to tell
you guys I found that my new favorite
lipstick I've used this before but I
just like refounded in my purse and I
love these things and I heard bad
reviews about them which I was so
surprised about this NYX lip lingerie
and I talked about these in a video
before and I said it's in the shade fear
for likley but that's not true that's
not the shade it's actually just I think
the shade 0 for ruffle trim so it helps
the color I have not with Lee that's not
even the name of it and I've been mixing
this with this Paul and jewel lipstick
but I should be dive in the video I did
a whole review on ecology of cosmetics
because they are so cute I'll show you
how to be fasting is at top selfies
before but I just wanted to share with
you guys my favorite lip combo right now
because this is a very random video
this is what the packaging looks like
it's very adorable and then when you
open it up it's this really pretty color
and I've been mixing these two together
and I really really like them so if
you're looking for angeles condo for
like a nice little rosy color these are
really good together
i'll show you guys up close what they
look like it's kind of just more like a
nudey color you know what I'm saying and
another thing that I've been loving is
this turning into like a favorites video
I don't know maybe it is but another
thing I've been loving is great nails
I got my nails done a few days ago and I
got some great they kind of wanted to go
out of my comfort zone a little bit and
just what they look like
this so pretty I love them so much and
they match my pants
like the exact color of my pants which
just makes me really happy because these
new pants and long that and I'll just
tell you about my pants
change pants are like days like 72 jeans
I don't know if you can see but they are
so comfy and I've seen a lot of people
wearing these lately and I was like I
want air I want to be able to pull those
off so I got them and they're so cute I
got them from a little bit peak here in
LA but I've seen a ton of different
places that have them like Urban
Outfitters and I've seen them on a fox
so I'll try to find some day like this
and lengthen down below if you're
interested but they're just so comfy
they feel like pajama pants which makes
me really happy and this shirt is from
oh it's from American Apparel because
American Apparel is closing down in
America I think I think only in America
is closing down or maybe just alone in
LA I'm not really sure but I got pissed
at American Apparel everything was 50%
off because they're closing down and
this would look $3 so if you have an
American Apparel around you you should
go check it out because I think
everything phone sales up but I'll try
to just show you my shoes to see through
my shoes these are from forever 21 from
a long
yeah and that's all I don't happen but I
know this video was very random I don't
even know what I'm going to call this
video really because what did I really
need to talk about but I just want to
come on here and kind of update you guys
and what you know is going on in my life
some I love you guys so much and don't
forget to follow me on Instagram
