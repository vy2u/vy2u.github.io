to be filming a part two of a video that
we did a little while ago we filmed me
going shocked wait we film are you
shuffling stopping for me and now today
I'm gonna go shopping for him because
the top comma in that video was you guys
telling me I should do that for him
suddenly since it makes sense okay so
today I'm going to do the exact same
rules if you guys haven't seen the video
that we did before I'll put that in the
description box but I'm gonna have two
hundred dollars should go by three
different assets for you you had the
money this time yeah now it's my cash
I'm gonna go you know pick out what I
think that you like what I like for you
to wear I don't shop I don't I haven't
probably bought new clothes and maybe
two years so I don't yeah so I don't
really care what I get I'm just excited
to get new clothes
okay so do you have any anything that
you would like to try it better be good
that's all along the whole process I'll
blog myself picking out stuff who knows
maybe I'll be more of a harsh judge than
you think maybe I'll be like I don't
like that we'll see we'll see be nice oh
well okay let's go alright bye bye hey
we just got to our destination we're at
the Grove a lot of options so I'm ready
but I'm kind of sad I have to go
shopping alone I wish you can come what
I wish my hand please
okay my first stop is Topshop and I need
to find the medication I feel like this
is a nice place for the constitute so
let's see if I can find anything
this part of this short is short
ever so that's a no but he did say he
needed new swimming shorts but these are
$42 which is so expensive sounding shoes
and I think that these are really cute
where these a lot really Marcus only
wears like bands which are fun but I
feel like he needs some nicer shoes so I
might get them these I'm seeing the
theme of ripped
in the second very interesting I've been
in talks a while now and I really like
like failure because I can't find
anything like super senses so I found
these shoes they're on sale for $45 and
I think that they're pretty cute for
just like everyday so I got these well I
haven't got them yet but I'm gonna get
them and then I found this shirt it's
$45 but just a cute denim shirt okay I
spent $88 at Topshop which is way too
much and I didn't even buy an account
but I just thought of shirt and shoes I
still have two other outfits to get but
I got a student discount which is pretty
good but I have to go find a cheaper
store because I might be in a lot of
trouble I'm now in the sales section and
everything is still exclusive I'm any
sale and it's still everything's like
hundred dollars so I'm trying to find a
shirt I'm trying to find source but I
don't know this is kind of cute but it's
a small and I think he's a medium so I'm
gonna keep on looking
we left the grow because I couldn't find
anything that was not super expensive so
I couldn't stay on my budget if we
stayed at the Grove so we're driving
over to forever 21 and I think I'll be
able to get the rest of the clothes from
there but I just didn't know that the
girl was so expensive I didn't know you
just couldn't get it done as quick as I
could as good you had the cheap stirrers
all around you all I had was like the
freaking expensive waiters but I'll show
you that your clothes are going to be
very cute that's right
super trendy and a rich sweatshirt this
is just not okay I might be getting this
okay so now we are back at Marx's house
and we went on a shopping extravaganza
it was way harder than I thought I
thought I was just gonna crush it and it
would be so easy and I'll just pick up
clothes so fast it took three times
longer than I said I took so long
first I'm gonna start out with your
daytime outfit so this
I'm not even know if they'll fit ooh
here's the thing is I don't know if I do
ripped jeans I mean I could it doesn't
matter I know it's in have rips in them
but the fade it seems to me like not
that not that cool we'll see we'll see
what's this okay yeah I like this shirt
and we're totally where this is very
good it looks a little large though huh
that's a medium okay
these are for every single outfit okay
these shoes
I definitely would never have picked
these out but these are cool really yeah
I would wear these they were on sale
yeah I would have never picked these out
personally but I think I would wear
these hello I like it um
all right first impressions the pants
actually should very well I didn't think
I was gonna like the fade but I think
I'm diggin it
wait this outfit is so cute let's be
honest here I did it amazing this shirt
fits great oh that's perfect
the pants are good they're great they
look good I just don't like the holes
here I mean I think they look good but
the holes here are so annoying to put on
because both times even when I try it on
the second leg the first one my foot
just went and just ripped a giant hole
like even bigger on the side so what's
the overall score of this Averell score
on this looks-wise is a how was the
overall tonight yeah it looks 9 for
looks and for comfortability
comfortability like a 6 the second I'll
do your comfy outfit okay okay this has
a story behind so in Topshop and in
forever 21 um everything had holes in it
like all the shirts like ripped it okay
I kind of bought a regular shirt in
repose is Sun this is the first
sweatshirt it had holes in it I have a
green shirt we could ripped holes in
evade sweatshirt and then I know you
like joggers sweatpants so these are
some job your sweatpants Wow and you can
pair them with your polka-dots
okay all right I mean look it looks good
it looks good so far I just I wouldn't
wear it that's the only thing I know hey
how does everything fit let's see it's
good
it's comfortable I'm not going to be
able to wear it summertime well winter
is perfect it was perfect for wheeler
okay I think the thought tough actually
fits you good so Charlotte packs off
nice I didn't have one thing that I'm
surprised about this is a real rip
exposing the skin and like what if I nip
slip on accident you know yeah that
wasn't this it's good I mean it's good I
like it as long as you like it really I
didn't judge here I would never wear
this out maybe maybe during the
wintertime but I feel like this is like
too casual well yeah it's your comfy
outfit and the socks
I think the socks add a little pop of
you know happiness to that but they make
you dance so I got this
this one's from Topshop and I thought
you would really like this sorry this is
just a denim shirt and I have little
dreams so I thought we might be matching
and then for shorts I got you these
because I know you said you what you
needed to do short mm-hmm so just some
bunch of casual nice shorts and then to
top it all off some American flag socks
cuz he loves in there I do okay and you
can get wear those with your new brown
shoes okay whoa good catch outfit number
three how do you like it I like those
socks a lot I would say that the arms
been nice wow that's a nice shirt that's
a really nice shirt it looks really good
on you
you want to know my first impression
when I saw it yes I said hmm I already
have like three shirts like this except
none of them fit this good the same
thing with the pants I said dang I
already have pants just like these that
are they kind of tight around here but
they don't fit well so I have to say
that all the pants that you've bought me
fit perfectly I never find things that
fit me perfect yeah that's really good
that's what I was most nervous about was
the pants I was like oh I don't know I
feel like guy sizes are really confusing
right so this one
it's a quasi valence of 10 I like this
one better so this one gets a 10 change
that one doing well they can all be tens
pence
overall I like it I thought when I first
saw everything initially I was like and
then when I put it on and I saw myself
with it on I said all right yeah I like
this and I think it was the same thing
for you also because the fact that I
don't like going out and shopping and I
don't love it yeah so from now on you're
just going to shop for me for everything
yeah you'll just buy me clothes just
come home with new clothes for me second
look good if it's someone we're married
I'll always be buying your new clothes
