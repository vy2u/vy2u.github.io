little bit early because I have to go to
the Apple store today who likes going to
the Apple store no one but my phone has
been shattered for so long and I just
have to get fixed can you tell how
shattered that is it's shattered in
every corner possible so I'm gonna go
get that fixed and they said my best bet
would be to come in before the store
opens set an appointment
I don't really know so that's where I'm
heading right now and I have to show you
my outfit because it's hilarious
I like pogrom on ster look at this also
watching Grover right now because Lexie
and Cody is so we have three dogs and
it's a little bit of a total party all
the time I just got back from the Apple
Store I'm not gonna have my phone for
three hours so that stinks but it kind
of feels free being without your phone
there's some people working on our house
and vac so sore if you hear some
drilling but I'm gonna make some food
it's like 11 o'clock already so it's not
really breakfast but I'm just
oh yeah
I'm propping you guys on a pillow right
now which is probably not the smartest
thing ever
won't cook it I put on a little bit of
makeup and I changed my outfit because I
was feeling very very frumpy in my gray
monster outfit but I wanted to show you
guys my most recent order that I got
from thredUP
because it's a big one guys it's a real
big one and you guys know I love thredUP
I love through shopping and if you don't
know thredUP is the world's biggest
online surf store which basically equals
Kristen's heavens so I absolutely love
shopping on thredUP a thing that I love
about thredUP is that you're finding it
unique pieces that aren't in every store
at that moment and that's like one of my
favorite things about thrift shopping is
that you're finding unique pieces and
they make it super easy because you can
actually type in whatever brand that you
want to search for like if you're like I
love Zara so I'm gonna shop for Zara
stuff on thredUP you can do that or you
can kind of just scroll through the
website and find kind of like new brands
that you would never heard of before so
the first thing that I got is a super e
super e is the super wintery item but
that's kind of perfect because in LA
it's been a little bit chilly lately and
also we're planning on going on a ski
trip soon so this will be perfect this
is from the brand tiny which I had never
heard of this brand before but that is
the most adorable brand name ever it's
just this amazing Pico and it has this
attachable so for collar on it and
buttons and pockets and the estimated
retail price of this coat was actually
one hundred and seventy nine dollars and
I got it from thredUP for $50 so I
thought that was an amazing deal this is
perfect for our ski trip coming up right
mm-hmm you can actually ski or just look
pretty in the stuff
I should be with my people guess what
the brand of this is tiny
is it really yeah look see and the next
thing that I got is actually unlike the
complete opposite seasonal spectrum this
is a very summery item and this is
originally from Urban Outfitters and the
estimated retail price of this one was
$60 and I got it for $16 that's actually
huge where'd you get that probably came
for crashing into you
oh the next thing I got is
fancy-schmancy to the max this is a
black lace long-sleeve like I think this
would go down to like mid calf but we'll
see when I try it on this is a beautiful
dress holy moly
me and Marcus need to go on a fancy date
for this one this is from the brand
Jill Jill Stuart this actually has still
the original tag on it and the estimated
retail price of this dress was 239
dollars and I got it for $59 so is a
good big deal and the last thing that I
got is from one of my favorite brands
ever and this is from made well I
absolutely love made well and I always
check the made well section of thread up
and I can usually find something
actually and this is an extra small
little athletic jacket and I was just
talking my friend about needing one of
these so bad because every time I go on
hikes in LA I always wear like a big
sweatshirt but within like the first
five minutes I'm so hot and then in the
beginning I'm so cold so I just needed
like an easy zip up light athletic
jacket and so when I saw this one on
throwing up I was like that is so
perfect we can actually probably try
this on right now for you guys I love
the material that made well makes all of
their athletic stuff and it's like so
stretchy but so soft and the estimated
retail price of this jacket was 140
and I got it for 29 so and if you guys
want to check out thredUP
they are actually giving you 30 percent
off your first order if you use the code
kristan 30 you can just click the link
that output in my description box and
you got yourself a deal okay I'm gonna
go hang up all these clothes in my
closet because that's what I do when I
get really excited about new clothes
okay it's a tiny bit later and I'm about
to actually edit a video that I'm gonna
be posting soon but I had a lot of
questions on my plant oh what's just
closed it's really messy closet that's
embarrassing I got a lot of questions on
my plant collection video about my
watering routine and maybe I'll show you
guys that in a later video but something
that I do do do do everyday is I take a
sprayer and I'll show you exactly what I
do you can just get these types of
bottles on Amazon I really like the
color of like amber spray bottles but
since a lot of house plants are actually
tropical plants you can just take your
sprayer because they really like
humidity in the air and I like to just
you know give them a tiny dream fiddle
Leafs likes to be frayed as well
especially if you have the heater on in
your house a lot of the times it can dry
out the leaves and things like that can
happen like they can just get a little
crusty so it's really good to do this to
your plants I was just editing and then
I got a very exciting package little
package from NARS let's see what's in
here whoo okay so these are NARS is new
highlighting powders let me just see
what this looks like oh my gosh I love
this packaging okay so here are all the
colors I want to swatch them so bad I
haven't swapped them yet okay so let's
just do this one oh they feel so nice
okay here is the shade Ibiza and then
let's do this one because I feel like
this one is just like calling my name
wow these feels so soft I love that
that one is called fort-de-france let's
do this one too why not just do them all
whoa that's like a very bronzy one this
one is in the shade st. Barths this
would be so pretty on deeper skin tones
holy cannoli
this one I think is an albatross I'm
just guessing because I remember they
used to have a shade that looked really
similar to this yep albatross and then
this last one is like a light shimmery
pink oh okay I'm actually gonna swatch
one of these on my cheek because I feel
like that's the best way to really see
what it looks like so I'm gonna use this
shade fort-de-france because I feel like
this one is the best for my skin tone
holy wow this is beautiful
we're at the mall about to pick up my
phone and I'm trying to be very discreet
because I hate walking in public yeah
you have something right here
yeah you're good okay Marcus I'm gonna
with him do you think that do you think
this orange is going to be sour or sweet
yes at first plants I think it's gonna
be sweet at first glance I think it's
been variously this smell
sour is exactly I want to continue no
but that was sour than usual go try it
again
it's not that bad right
you were wrong
you're such a liar and we're right by
Claire's so under all right let's do it
are you embarrassed that everyone's
looking at you blogging like everyone's
looking at you they all saw you everyone
can see it all right here we go he's
looking at the board where a little star
yeah babe I'm gonna get a little Daisy
this in my belly gonna hurt so bad
the shoe
oh did it hurt oh you're eyes are watery
wow they look crazy it feels so good to
have a non cracked screen guys like I
forgot what this life was like I had my
screen cracked for so long everything's
feeling good I didn't realize how much
it would not hurt at all like it's
seriously it was like one second maybe
of pain but I'm so glad I did it I
wanted to do this for a while but I just
like never really thought to actually do
it but it's happy now I have to figure
out what to make for dinner and we have
no ingredients really and I do not feel
like going to the store but I do have
these two acorn squash and my mom always
used to make these and I'm pretty sure I
remember how to make them this obviously
won't be filling enough but this is a
start so the first thing you gotta do is
cut this in half
just like that it's harder okay and
you're gonna want to scrape the guts out
pours the seeds all you have to do is
take your squash to place it cut side up
on your baking sheet and then you can
kind of just season it however you want
I think I'm just gonna do olive oil
garlic powder onion salt maybe some tony
satter ease and peppery okay so here's
what the acorn squash look like and I'm
just gonna pop them in the oven i
last-minute decided I'm just gonna make
sure even though we had shrimp a few
nights ago it's the only protein we have
and I just think we need something
besides it's just a corn squash okay I
just put some olive oil in a pan heating
it up a little bit and then I'm gonna
add in my diced onions
and I'm also gonna add garlic in but a
trick that my mom taught me is that
garlic burns way quicker and then onions
so usually you should add that after
your onions cooked up a little bit
here's the finished dinner acorn squash
some quinoa with avocado and tomato and
then some shrimp tell them what we found
out about honey found out that she is
neither said her because red golden
retrievers are half Irish Setter
half golden retriever and she has a lot
of Irish Setter in her like more than
the average gold richer that's why she's
a lot smaller like you if you look at
videos of Irish Setters that's how she
acts what are you doing she's crying
yeah okay guys I think I'm gonna end the
vlog here I've been editing I'm still in
my regular clothes and I just need to go
put on my pajamas ASAP because I'm about
to fall asleep but at the end of my
vlogs I always try to do a little like
encouragement for you guys or like a
little devotion or something that I've
been learning lately and something that
I've been learning a lot and really
thinking a lot about today is pruning
basically pruning is just taking off the
dead parts of the plant so that the
plant can be sending energy and
nutrients to the healthy parts of the
plant to ultimately keep it alive and
happier and the Bible actually talks a
lot about pruning and kind of makes it a
metaphor for us and I think that is such
an important thing to do in your life
because I feel like so many times we put
our energy and even just like our
subconscious into things that aren't
helping us at all sorry honey squeaking
hair toy even if it's something like
having a very negative person in our
life that really brings us down or a
habit that really or even having like a
habit that is taking a toll on your life
or just following someone that is super
negative on social media that you should
unfollow just all of those things are
little acts of like pruning that you can
do to make ultimately your life better
and healthier and happier just a happier
healthier you so that is something that
I have started doing just kind of
becoming more aware of the things that I
do need to cut out of my life just even
if it's not a huge thing
taking little steps just to make you and
your heart healthier so that's something
that I've been thinking about lately so
anyways I hope that you guys enjoy this
vlog I love my new earrings
it's so cute I'll keep you guys updated
on how it does let's pray that it does
not get infected and I will see you guys
very soon if you did like this video
