today I have some fun things planned my
mom is actually in town which is so
happy and I'm about to take her to
Hollywood and we're gonna go eat lunch
and have some fun but oh my gosh camper
just tooted Allah camper you just tooted
but before we go I just wanted to say
thank you for all your comments and
concerns about us because of the LA
fires it's actually pretty close to us
and the air quality at our house is
terrible my lungs are so tight and my
eyes hurt so bad so I'm really seriously
sending all my prayers to everybody that
is affected by these fires it's so
horrible but all I happier now I'll show
you really quick my outfit of the day
and look how cute wait first look I
don't know if you can tell but there's
like ash all over my mirror so this
dress thing is from Zara kids which if
you know me you know I love to shop it's
our kids because it fits great and they
have really cute stuff for a lot cheaper
and then this little turtleneck short
sleeve shirt is from brandy melville and
then I'm wearing my boots that I wear
all the time
like every single day I've been wearing
these so that's my outfit of the day
feeling very Christmasy look how good I
got chicken noodle soup
flatbread mom got a burger in a salad
look what I just came home to what are
you doing
this is me and Marcus's new favorite
thing ever so it just looks like a
regular blanket so this is called the
gravity blanket I get it it's basically
made especially for people who struggle
with insomnia or people who are slight
syndrome which I have yes it's a real
thing and when you're under it this is a
weighted blanket so when you're under it
really does just feel so cozy anybody
that I've made test this blanket I've
put it on top of them knowing this is
the best thing ever I walk out of the
room expecting them to follow me and
then I just go back in 30 minutes and
they're still under the blanket okay
check this out when Kristen first got it
I never fall asleep before Kristen I'm
always up later on my phone yeah I fell
asleep immediately as soon as this was
on me and as a lot of you guys know I
used to have horrible and Zambia in high
school and I feel like something like
this could have really been helpful for
that so if any of you struggle with that
or have anxiety I feel like this would
be a great thing to have or even if you
just want to feel very cozy the gravity
blanket is like caterpillar the gravity
blanket is really amazing it's actually
dope though like I will straight-up
Bausch so I have it in my head that I
need to make homemade hot chocolate I've
never made homemade hot chocolate before
so let's see if I even have any
ingredients let's look up homemade hot
choc latte
it's the world's best hot chocolate oh
this is what it looks like I mean that
looks amazing to me let's see if we have
the ingredients I have all the
ingredients okay so you need 1/4 a cup
of cocoa a half a cup of sugar 1/2 a
teaspoon of salt 1/3 cup of water 4 cups
of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla I got
all of that
means I can make it and I even bought
mini marshmallows the other day so oh my
gosh I'm so excited it says to add in
all the dry ingredients so I need to get
Coco sugar salt okay so I have all of my
dry ingredients so 1/4 a cup of cocoa I
feel like you would normally need more
I'm just gonna do that and then I'm
gonna add my salt I love keeping all my
ingredients like just random ingredients
and jars like this because it just makes
it look nicer than like a regular box so
I get these all from Hobby Lobby if
you're curious and I like to keep my
salt and pepper in little jars like this
just cute ok so you mix all this around
I mean sugar and cocoa that's amazing ok
now you add the water it's only a third
of a cup of water this is what it looks
like after it's been boiling for 1
minute now we're gonna add our milk now
this is really starting to look like hot
chocolate add 1 teaspoon of vanilla this
is the vanilla I use and it's amazing
it's from Trader Joe's it's so good I
put a lot of marshmallow this is
supposed to be the world's best hot
chocolate but it has no dairy in it I
promise
yeah I know ok here so I'm nervous is it
so good tell the truth yeah I put some
salt in it oh is it so good okay I'm
gonna taste it oh my gosh that is really
good it tastes really salty
