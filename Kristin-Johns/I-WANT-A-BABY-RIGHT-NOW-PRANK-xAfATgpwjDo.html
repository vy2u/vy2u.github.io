today's video
Oh as you can tell from the title I'm
gonna attempt to prank Marcus in into
thinking that I want to start having
babies right now like I want to start
having kids as soon as possible
um I keep her just brought in my whole
rug from the other room but I don't know
if you guys know it or not but I am NOT
a prankster I never pulled pranks on
Marcus which is why I think this might
be successful because he hopefully won't
suspect anything but I got this video
idea from Aspen Oh Bart I'm sure you
guys know who she is she's a really cute
youtuber here her video was hilarious
and when I saw it I was just like I have
to do this to Marcus so I'll link her
video down below all the credit to her
for this idea but I'm so nervous me and
Marcus I mean we talked about having
kids a lot but it's like oh yeah in
seven years so this is gonna be a big
like jump from what we've discussed
before so I mean really start practicing
my acting skills Marcus is that CrossFit
right now and he'll be home in a little
bit but the thing I'm worried about is
where I'm gonna hide the camera because
he's a very observant person so I don't
know what I'm gonna do okay I'm gonna
try to find a spot to hide the camera I
don't know where but the camera right
now it's at the top of Marcus's father
and me that'll be okay but I want you'll
be able to see it
I think what you're saying how we've
always wanted
five years because I saw the cameras
sitting there but the lens was off and I
was like well that's weird I was about
to be like Kristen you shouldn't have
the camera though the dogs gonna hit it
and then I'm just like wait this doesn't
add up this is so weird well have you
had me going for a little bit here's the
thing it's that when she starts saying
weird things like that I get I feel
weird I start to like hide my face and
feel bashful and it was just I thought
it was sweet but I mean we're not gonna
have kids anytime soon but I actually
really liked the fact that she wanted to
have kids because it just means she
loves me but now it's all a ruse so she
doesn't really love you that much
forever I told you guys that my most
nervous thing was hiding the camera and
I obviously did a horrible job yeah you
should have did you think at all that I
wanted to have you now do I get it cuz
you were like go check the couch it
smells better and I was like the couch
doesn't smell any better at all it still
smells disgusting but as I was passing
the corner my solid no I saw the camera
I want to leave the camera there so you
were like oh he just was filming a video
right and that's what actually went
through my head but then now I know why
you made me go in that room so you could
turn the camera on hit report it was
really good the camera no too bad you
had me going for a little bit actually
that's why I'm pulling down your pants
and likewise
okay but um maybe in the future I'll be
better at pranks guys I'm even starting
to like get these red things on me nice
cuz that's what happens when I get
really nervous or think something's
really funny but I was just really
nervous
Wow guys I just looked at the footage
and I just realized my head was cut off
in the whole video so basically now you
guys know I am very bad at pranking I
probably won't be pranking again
because I'm just not cut out for that
life so I hope you enjoyed this one
single prank video that will ever go up
on my channel probably and I'm sorry
that I'm definitely a beginner prankster
but um yeah so I'll see you in the next
video where I won't be pranking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
