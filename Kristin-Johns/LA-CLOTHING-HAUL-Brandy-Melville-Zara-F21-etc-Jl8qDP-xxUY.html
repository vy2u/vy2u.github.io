clothing haul for you guys and as many
of you know or might know I have been in
California for the past month and a half
and while I was there I picked up a few
things that I want to show you guys a
lot of you guys ask me where I get my
clothes so I figured I should just tell
you where I got these and then maybe I
can start doing more like style fashion
videos for you guys if you would like
that let me know ok so the first place
that I went was forever 21 and I only
got one thing from forever 21 and it is
this little shirt and it just has little
flowers on it and I really like the
material of it because it's really light
and flowy but my favorite part of this
shirt is the back and the back is so
cute because it has these little ties on
it so I just thought that was the cutest
thing ever and it was only like 12
dollars so I thought I had to have it
and this is the only thing I got from
forever 21 but I figured I'd show you
guys because I love it next place I went
was Zara and in Florida we don't really
have Sora's at least around where I live
and so I had to go there and the first
things I bought were these two crop top
tank tops and I really love these they
were really inexpensive only 590 haven't
worn them yet I haven't had the chance
but I really love these I think I'll be
wearing them a lot this summer because
again they go with a lot of different
stuff and they're just really easy I
also thought these might be good to work
out in because they're kind of like
fitted and yeah I just really like them
and I can't believe how cheap they were
595 is pretty good deal the next thing I
got from Zara is my favorite thing I
bought in LA hands down I was wearing it
in my last video and it is this little
squirt overall thing I don't really know
what you call it but it's just overall
that are score and you can see it like
opens up here and you have your little
shorts but I have been wanting overalls
for so long and I finally got some and
these are the cutest ones I've ever seen
because they
have a little bee at the bottom they
also have little ants crawling up the
back and it's all the details and I just
really love them and so I was wearing
these in my last video and a lot of you
guys we're asking me where I got them
they're from Zara the next place I went
was brandy melville and we don't have a
brandy melville in Florida either so I
really wanted to go because I really
like their clothes and the first thing I
got from there was this little tank top
it's not cropped or anything it's just
regular shirt sized
and I just really liked it it's simple
and you guys might be able to tell I
just like simple clothes I don't really
go crazy with my clothes I don't really
take many risks um yeah and I really
like this shirt because it fits really
nicely it's super soft all of the
clothes from brandy melville that I've
gotten are really really soft and yeah
it's just a nice basic shirt for like
everyday
shenanigans get out of the show the next
thing I got is this off-the-shoulder
scrunchie stretchy shirt and I was
wearing this a lot in my pictures on
Instagram from when I was in Mexico and
I got a ton of comments for you guys
asking me where I got it it is from
brandy melville and it just goes off
your shoulders and it's cropped and it's
super cute and this was really
inexpensive I think this was only like
15 bucks I also got this shirt from
brandy melville and it's just a short
sleeve denim shirt it's a little bit
short but it's not necessarily like
cropped or anything and I feel like this
is kind of unique because I usually just
see long-sleeve denim shirts and so I
really like this one so I picked it up
and I've already worn it a few times and
I think it looks really cute on so um
I'm trying to figure out how to do the
whole denim on denim thing but kind of
scares me at the moment so I've just
been wearing this with black jeans um
but maybe one day I'll be brave enough
to wear it with like jean shorts or Jean
pants um do
pants that's just jeans visit the last
thing that I got from brandy melville
it's just a little hat and oh I got
something on it it's just a little red
hat that says California on it and I
thought it was really cute and I knew
that we were gonna go hiking so I needed
a hat and this one was only like $12 I
think so this is the one I got the next
place that I went shopping was Nasty Gal
and I have never shopped there before
and uh I don't think I had ever really
seen any of their clothes either but
I've heard of them before so I went in
and this is the only thing I got I got
this little white linen romper and it's
really cute on it doesn't look like that
cute not on but on I promise it's cute
the back is the cutest part because it
does a little crisscross with the straps
and yeah I just really like it next
place that I went was it called
wasteland and wasteland is a store where
people can sell their clothes to that
store and then the store sells clothes
to you so it's like Plato's Closet or
something like that but it's all for
like more designer clothes I guess so
they just sell designer clothes for
cheaper that are used that make sense I
only got one thing from there because it
was kind of expensive and I was like but
I just thought these shoes and they're
from Jeffrey Campbell and I've wanted
these shoes for so long I have them
pinned on Pinterest I always look for
them online but they never have them and
they're just these little booties and
they're super cute they're so
comfortable they go with everything and
when I first almost like no those are my
shoes that I've always wanted and then I
was like okay are they going to be my
size and they're just like half a size
too big for me but I don't care because
I still had to get them the very last
place that I went was called Oh what
called oh the last place that I went was
called paper doll and it's a little
boutique on Melrose and the reason that
I'm saving these for last is because I
don't know if you guys can find these
online or not but if you can I'll tell
you the brands that they have on their
little tag and this is from a brand
signature 8 and they're just these
boyfriend jeans they're kind of
oversized and ripped all the way down
and I've always wanted boyfriend jeans
so I found these and they're really
cheap they're only like $20 so how did
got them and I really liked them um the
worst part of these pants is the fact
that they have like eight buttons that
you have to button up so when you really
have to pee it's kind of a bummer
because it's a struggle to unbutton all
of these buttons I know that from
experience next thing I got I wore in my
may favorites video and it is from the
same store and it's just this little
romper and it has little lace
embellishments down there and the back
is really cute it has like a little
keyhole back and I've been wearing this
a ton because this is just like the
cutest romper I've ever seen and it's
floral and happy and I really love it a
lot and this was also from that same
boutique and the last thing that I got
is from that same brand audrey 3+1 from
the same boutique and it's just this
black and white romper it's kind of like
loose-fitting and it's really soft and
the sleeves are really nice um kind of
like loose at the end and it's really
cute on and I kind of like romper crazy
I feel like this month because robbers
are just so easy and it kind of makes
you look like you put together a full
outfit when you really didn't have to so
I love that that is it for everything
that I got in LA I really hope that you
guys like this video if you want more
haul videos or style videos then just
give this video a thumbs up and I will
definitely do that and also don't forget
to subscribe for new videos every single
week and before I go I just wanted to
say thank you guys for a hundred
thousand subscribers that is insane to

encouraging and I just really want to

positive experience for me and I just

wouldn't have any subscribers so just
