leaving to go to San Francisco and I
wasn't I didn't know I was like I don't
know if I should be flogging this or not
because we're only going for two nights
but I think it's gonna be fun and I
think that you guys will like maybe sing
around San Francisco I've only been to
San Francisco I think this will leave my
third time but I feel like I've never
really gotten to explore it and I feel
like this time we're gonna get to see a
lot of cool stuff so I want to bring you
guys along with me and it's really cool
because benefit is actually um letting
us come and see their headquarters and
it's just gonna be really fun we're
gonna meet some of the benefit team and
I don't even know I don't even know
exactly what we have planned but I know
it's gonna be fun so right now I'm kind
of just packing up we're just gonna
bring carry-ons because you gotta travel
light for only three-day trips you can't
bring a whole suitcase that's what you
said but I think it did pretty good I
just brought a little carry-on
it's gonna be my airport outfit I always
lay that out here's my airport outfit
you gotta go with comfy for the airport
am i right
we just got to the hotel and look what
Marcus found the biggest chair of life
this is the cutest thing ever
look at this view so nice so we just
finished our first little part of the
shoot that we're doing and now it's time
for lunch
Marcus has been such a good sport he's
just - enjoy
he's like chillin a huge makeup flake
makeup company stuff that's really nice
of him okay but now it's lunch time I
deserved it right
we finished up at the shoot and now
we're just kind of exploring San Fran
there's Marcus look where we are there's
a lot of people found this store called
beta and look at this camera it has all
of these lenses and there's like a robot
going around guys controlling it my gosh
that is a carbon fiber it's honor
it how it light is it can I feel it that
light but it's like just interesting
that it's made of carbon fiber it
actually is a really nice sound I'm
doing two weeks of noticer and look what
we just passed we just got back to the
hotel I took off all my makeup and I
feel so fresh and today was such a fun
day
I am tired so I'm gonna hit the hay I'm
gonna go to sleep get a good night rest
good night it is our final day and San
Fran we leave later today but before we
leave we're actually going on a van tour
all around San Fran to see all the cool
places so I'm very excited about that
we're actually running a tiny bit late
so let's go
okay so we're leaving San Francisco now
but I had to do one thing for he left
how much is chair costs $3,000 would you
pay 3
okay we are back from San Fran it's been
actually a few days
I think this lipstick is way too light
for me right now let me change that
really quick okay much better much more
like myself okay so like I was saying we
got back from San Fran a few days ago it
was such a fun trip and I can't wait to
edit this vlog just to like remember all
of the memories campers kissing himself
why are you kissing yourself buted of
yourself but I was thinking I didn't
really have a proper end to the vlog and
I just wanted like end it abruptly what
is your problem actually the first thing
that I wanted to tell you guys is that I
completely changed this room around and
I think that you guys are really gonna
like it
sorry campers being insane right now if
you've been following the vlogs for a
little bit now you would know that this
room is like the one room in my house
that I cannot decide on and I think it's
because it's my favorite room and I
think it has the most potential to be
like totally what I want because it is
like my office so I'm just very
indecisive about it so now when you walk
in it looks like this I switched this
mirror from over here to over here
because the lighting was better for when
I'm like taking videos in the mirror and
I put this over here now I'm gonna take
all of these decorations and put them
over here I'm gonna get a big circle
mirror for right there and I changed the
desk and this desk I got from Craigslist
which was like the best find of my whole
life
I got it for I think $250 and it's
originally from West Elm for like seven
hundred dollars so I was very happy
about that and I just feel like this
desk ties into the room better than my
old wood also found
at the thrift store the other day and
I'm definitely gonna be hanging it in
here
how cute is this like what and I got
this for 399 from Goodwill and I love it
so right now I just have it set up here
against this window
I'm still trying to kind of figure out
this whole room but I know that when
it's done I'm gonna be like so happy
because now it's been it's almost been
six months since we've lived here so
this room needs to get done like ASAP
why you have such an attitude today huh
Oh guys also honey got fixed a few days
ago or wait was that yesterday I don't
know all the days are running together
but look she has her little shaved leg
but she's doing very good she has all
her medicines and now you can't have
puppies anymore Marcus is at singing
lessons right now and I think it's very
cute that Marcus goes to singing lessons
I just have to say that he goes every
single week and I just think look at
quite such a cutie and I had this plant
sitting on the windowsill to get some
Sun so I'm just gonna put him back where
he lives just right here dad's home
photos is it happy to see conehead I
want to show you guys my outfit of the
day because I think my jewelry in a
second um this dress is so summery and
cute it's from Lulu's and I am obsessed
for my jewelry today I have three pieces
from rocksbox and I know I always say
this but rocks boxes packaging is just
so adorable so I've talked about rocks
box before on my channel a few times and
I know a lot of you guys you can use
rocks box because you found them through
my videos and that's so happy but if you
don't know what rocks box is it
basically a jewelry membership service
so they send you pieces every month and
you can keep what you want and then you
can obviously send back what you don't
want which i think is really cool and I
always say this but I'm the worst person
that wearing jewelry
I usually just I wear my wedding ring
this ring right here in the middle and
this and then I just forget it like I'm
so bad at going and shopping and getting
new jewelry so this is like a lifesaver
for me because I still do love jewelry
I'm just like bad at getting it for
myself
membership is $21 a month and in each
box you get three different pieces of
jewelry so I wanted to show you guys
what I got in my box first thing in here
is a necklace or a bracelet oh this is a
bracelet so this is the Sophie Harper
cave slider bar bracelet and gold and
crystal and I love this I love how
dainty it is I'm actually not like a
huge bracelet where because they're
always way too big for my wrist but I
really like how this one you can like
you can size it to your wrist really
easily okay so this is from an aster
here is what they look like
I actually think these would be really
cute and like my second hole right here
so that's what I'm gonna do and this is
a perfect example of something I would
definitely keep from my box because
these were actually like tarnishing
these other ones that I had so I'm so
happy about these so this is also from
aster and this is the foxglove charm
necklace and gold okay so here is what
the choker looks like and I think it
goes so perfectly with this earring and
this bracelet like it all just is very
sweet and simple and like easy to wear
so if you guys want to try out rocksbox
I actually have a code it's just Kristin
John's X 0 X 0 and you can get your
first month of rocksbox or totally free
which i think is a great deal so the
link to that will be in the description
it's lunchtime
we had Thai food last night and we had
leftovers so that's what we're gonna be
eating eagle ship we have a problem your
space helmet
yes it's leaking I've been doing some
work on my computer for the last few
hours and I saw this video and I was
gonna do it not on camera because this
probably won't work but if it does work
I really want to get this on video it
would be so cool
so in the video it said you take a water
model that is room temperature which I
have a water bottle that's room
temperature right here and then what you
do next is you put it in the
refrigerator for one and a half hours
and then once you take it out you're
supposed to be able to hit it on a table
like this and then the whole thing is
supposed to freeze like before your eyes
like it's really cool so I'm gonna put
it right there shut this and then I'm
gonna set my phone tiny we're we're an
hour and a half I'm taking it out you're
not allowed to shake it at all heck is
this watch this that could be you put it
on the counter yes and if I'm supposed
to be able to hit it and it turns into
solid ice before your eyes

supposed to happen
