he's the favorite I marry Marcus he's
the favorite that's it hey guys today
I'm super excited for this video
because I've been waiting to film this
video so I can show you all the kid
stuff I got I went online shopping at a
store called Lulu's I've been shopping
with them for so long and they just have
tons of cute clothes accessories shoes
you name it they probably got it so I
did a little bit of damage over at
Lulu's and I'm really excited to show
you guys what I got and I will also be
trying everything off you guys so you
can see how it looks on and I'm just
really excited so before I start I just
want to say sorry if my voice sounds
weird or really stuffy because I woke up
with a stuffy nose and I think I might
be getting cold okay so as you can
probably tell it's a little bit later on
in the day but I was just editing my
video and I saw that my camera cut out
the first thing that I was trying to
show you guys I have the rest of the
footage but I wanted to come back on
here and just refilm it because this is
one of my favorite things that I got and
it would be really sad if it got cut out
of the hall so this is the first thing
that I got is this white dress I got it
in an extra small as you can tell it's
very flowy and one of the things that I
love about this dress is that it has two
different layers so it has a built-in
slip and then this like see-through
flowy material and that's one of my pet
peeves is when white dresses or just
see-through and I'm like how am I
supposed to wear this so this one has
two layers which is really nice and the
way that we know that I really love this
dress is that I picked this as one of
the two dresses to wear and me and
Marcus's engagement pictures that we
took the other day so that's how you
know that I really love this dress
because engagement pictures are forever
and I posted some of my engagement
pictures on my Instagram so if you guys
want to check those out I'll link my
Instagram below and you guys should go
follow me
and yes so I love this dress so much and
I just had to come back on here and show
it to you guys the next thing in here is
this shirt and I've actually already
worn this and I love it so much it has
little gold buttons down it and it's
just really loose-fitting and it has a
nice kind of low neckline but it doesn't
show your bra or anything and I just
love this so much it's so soft and it's
really comfortable it's just a really
easy shirt that you can wear with jeans
or shorts or anything like that I just
think that it's perfect for everyday and
it's really cute this next thing might
be my favorite thing that I got out of
this whole haul so this is a little
romper wait is it a romper yes it's a
romper and it's so cute it has this
really cute off the shoulder neckline
and then it has little droopy sleeves at
the bottom of it so it kind of just
hangs like right here and it's just so
stinking cute I love the pattern of this
it's like very um Foresti flowery I I
just love it and the best part of all is
it has this really cute tie at the front
so it goes around your neck like this
and I just think it's so unique I've
never seen a romper shaped like this and
I just know I'm gonna wear this so much
and you guys know I love a good romper
so the next thing I got is this dress
and it's super super long and then it
has a little tie to cinch it at the
waist so it looks more fitted it's super
pretty for the summer and I was thinking
like a summer wedding it would be really
nice to wear that really excited about
this and I just feel really fancy
whenever I put this on so that's a plus
the next thing hi reminds me of what I'm
wearing now a little bit but in dress
form and it's this little like denim
dress but it's definitely not doing it's
just like denim colored but it's super
soft I don't remember what that is
called though like looks like denim but
not really doing them chambray but this
is really cute it has really cute cuffed
sleeves
and it's so comfy on it's just like the
softest thing ever
next I have this shirt and this shirt is
a little bit different than kind of the
style that I normally wear but I did
want to get out of my comfort zone a
little bit and I've been seeing this
style of like dresses and shirts a ton
so I jumped on the trend bandwagon and
this is what it looks like it has kind
of like poncho sleeves and it has little
white up tassels at the bottom and this
actually fits really cute it fits really
nicely on and I just think that this
would be really cute with jeans in the
summer I just feel like it's really
really nice and I actually really do
like this blue kind of like detail so
this next thing is really really cute I
love this dress so much let me zip it up
this is just a really cute black dress
and it has like mesh paneling around it
so it has a little bit of mesh like
right up here and also it has mesh down
where your wrists will be and also it
has it down at the bottom of the skirt
and it's a really really nice thick
material it just looks really nice on I
love love long sleeve dresses and this
one is just like one of the cutest ones
I've ever seen I got a lot of dresses
like this whole haul is mainly dresses
but it's okay because that's mainly what
I wear anyway so I also got this dress
and um it's a wrap dress and I don't
have any wrap dresses and my first
office in the mail I was like I don't
know if I love this pattern but once I
tried on this pattern actually looks
really really good on just kind of like
festive I don't know why I don't know
what it's festive for but it just feels
like you're going to like a Fiesta or
something the next thing I got is not a
dress surprisingly it's a little um
two-piece skirt and shirt so this is the
skirt that it comes with it's kind of
like fitted
and it's the softest material ever it
feels like maybe it says what material
it is no it doesn't but this material is
so soft it feels like wool or something
is wool soft but this is just like the
dang softest thing I've ever felt it
feels like cashmere or something and
it's really cute and the skirt is really
fitted and then the top is the same
material and it has this little
crisscross front kind of like it would
be addressed but it's just missing like
that much so a little bit of your
stomach shows and it's just so cute ok
the last thing is also a dress I have
dress problems but this one is really
cute and unique because I don't have
anything in my closet this color because
usually I'm kind of scared of orange I
don't know why I just never wear orange
and it has a little collar and the
cutest part of all is that it has a
little tie right here that you tie in a
bow so it just looks really sweet on and
it also looks kind of more businesslike
so I can wear this you know to a meeting
if I ever had a meeting or and you like
school event I just feel like this would
be perfect for anything that you kind of
have to look cute but business√≠ for you
don't insane so now I will move on to
more like accessory type things because
I got a few things um like that first
thing is this and I haven't opened this
yet because I wanted to put it on my
phone on camera for you guys and this is
a Sonic's iPhone case oh this is so cute
so this is what it looks like
it has little cactuses on it with little
like gold stars on it
this is so cute and actually it feels
very protected I know some phone cases
are just really cute but like if you
drop your phone it's done the next thing
that I got is this belt and this is the
coolest belt I've ever seen because it
has double buckles I've never seen a
belt with double buckles it was super
inexpensive and I know I'm going to be
wearing this a lot it feels like nice
quality too so I really like this and if
you're looking for a good cool unique
belt this is your guy I also got a bag
when I was shopping online and it looks
like this
I've been using this bag ever since I
got this order in I've just been waiting
to film this video but I have been
wearing this purse a ton and it's really
cool because this part zips open and you
can see you have a little pocket there
and I've just been keeping my sunglasses
in there and it also has this little
zipper too and then it has little
pockets inside so I love this purse so
much it's really small so you're not
going to be able to fit a ton of
different stuff in there but just for
everyday it's really really nice and
also you can use it as like a really
cute clutch or you can use the strap oh
the next two things are actually beauty
kind of ish items and I told you guys
about these in my get ready with me date
night video I use them and the first one
is this japonesque brush it's perfect
for bronzer it's perfect for contouring
and it just blends everything out super
nicely the bristles are not too soft
they're not too rough as you can see I
really love this brush I also got the
black Beauty Blender online at Lulu's
and I've been wanting to try a different
color Beauty Blender just to see if it
was any different or if it works the
same and I think that I like the black
beauty blender better than I like the
pink one weirdly enough a lot of you
guys were telling me in my video that
they actually are made with like
different purposes like the nude one is
for something else the pink ones for
something else this one is for like
something else I don't really know but I
really really like the whack one and the
last few things are shoes got three
pairs of shoes the first one is these
bad boys they're from the brand bamboo
and I love these shoes this is what they
look like they're black and they're
strappy this part goes around your ankle
and they're super comfy actually I was
like ooh these might not be very
comfortable I think since the heel is a
little bit thicker and it's not super
high maybe that's why they're a little
bit more comfortable again I also think
that the gold buckle is a really cute
detail it just makes them look really
nice
and I got these in a seven and a half
next shoes that I got are these and they
are from Madden girl and they look like
this they're so cute they are little
lace-up booties but you don't actually
have to lace them up because they have
snaky zipper that's my favorite thing
and they're a little peep toe and this
is my favorite type of shoe shoes that
will really go with everything and I get
so much use out of the booties that I do
have by the way booties is such a funny
word okay but I really love these I love
the little heel how it's like just
really cute and I love how they're suede
I love the color I love that you don't
have to lace them up and they're really
comfortable I got these in a 7 and 1/2
also and I just really love these and
last but not least I'm kind of out of
breath because I've been talking for so
long are these shoes these are last
thing I got and they're from the brand
and the show and they are these really
nice little heels and I've seen so many
people wearing feels like this and I
just think that they look so nice on
your foot that sounds really weird but
just since they're so like minimal like
they don't have very much you know
material on them it just really like
elongate your leg and I just have been
wanting a pair of these really bad and I
got the nude shade because I don't have
a ton of different nude heels I usually
have like brown or black so I decided to
get them in the nude shade and they have
this really comfy like padding to them I
appreciate that I appreciate any detail
of comfy nough sand any type of clothing
