bit of a different type of video for you
I just wanted to do more of a comfy
video just chill about sitting here on
my bed talking to you guys about my
heart and these type of videos really
are why I started YouTube I wanted to
make youtube to be able to share my love
of Jesus with my audience and just share
my heart and talk about real things and
I love makeup and I love fashion and
challenge videos I think that those are
so fun but these type of videos are what
I really love so I didn't want another
video to go by it without doing this
video because it has been on my heart
lately a lot to do this video and just
to kind of preface why I want to do this
type of video is because I think that
YouTube is such an amazing platform I
have an audience of over 200,000 people
which I just I still cannot even believe
that but with that I feel comes a
responsibility to be more vulnerable
with you guys and to be more open
because I feel like YouTube can just end
up being kind of surface-level and I
never really want that for my channel
because I want this to be a place where
we have kind of a more deeper
understanding of each other not just
surface level so that's kind of why I
wanted to do this video today so I just
wrote down a few questions that I wanted
to answer for you guys and this could be
a tag video it would be awesome if other
youtubers did this because I feel like
it would kind of break down the walls of
like the surface level of YouTube if you
know what I mean I don't know if that
makes sense
but I wrote down some questions and I
wanted to answer them for you guys so
the first question I have on here is
where does your joy come from and I
thought that this was a cool question to
start with just because I feel like this
is very different for everybody but the
root of where my joy comes from is Jesus
Christ and
love Jesus I am a Christian and that is
what shapes Who I am and kind of how I
live my life and I've gotten a ton of
questions asking how do you stay so
positive and like how are you always so
happy which that's not true I'm not
always happy but that is more the
downsides of social media you don't
really see the negative parts of
people's lives you kind of only see like
their perfect version of their life but
I would have to say I am more of a
positive and joyful person and that is
just because of Jesus he gives me so
much joy and when I am reading his word
or I'm in prayer and I'm just um in a
close relationship with him I can just
tell I am so much happier and I just
have this sense of joy that is different
than any joy that anything from the
world can bring and I don't know if that
makes sense but it is so true and I can
just tell when I haven't spent time
reading my Bible or I haven't spent time
in prayer I can just tell I feel more
drained and more exhausted so really
where my joy comes from is Jesus and my
relationship with God the next question
that I wrote is how do you feel most
loved and I also love this question
because it is different for everybody
but I think that the way I feel most
loved is by spending time with people um
I don't know if you guys have ever taken
the love language test but my two top
love languages are quality time and
physical touch so I love just spending
time with people and if I don't get to
spend time with people I feel more
disconnected from them which is why it's
really hard being in a long-distance
relationship with Marcus but we make
sure to kind of balance it out because
when we are together we're really
intentional about really being present
with each other
and just like making the most of the
time that we are sending together again
the way I feel most love is definitely
spending time with people cuddling with
people hugging people that is really
just my happiest thing the next question
is what is something that you've
overcome and I think that this is a
really hard question because I feel like
things that I've struggled with in the
past even though I've gotten a lot
better at handling them I still struggle
with them today a little bit even if
it's not as much as I used to but one of
those things I think is an extreme lack
of self confidence in middle school in
high school even if I didn't act like it
I was the least confident person ever
I just always compared myself to
everybody else I never wanted to talk I
never raised my hand in class I never
went out of my way to meet new people
just because I did feel very um just
self-conscious and didn't have any sense
of identity even though I did know Jesus
I didn't really have a intentional
relationship with him so I never really
spent time reading my Bible I never
really spent time in prayer so I think
that I just compared myself with other
people I didn't really know who the heck
I was I just it was just like that
awkward time middle school in high
school I just I just didn't have any
sense of self I didn't have any sense of
like purpose or identity so I think that
that's something that I really really
changed once I came to college because I
found friends that pointed me to Jesus
and I found friends that encouraged me
and lifted me up and that was just a
huge game changer I really found who I
was and I met Marcus freshman year and I
think that he also helped kind of make
me a more confident person because he
just always encouraged me and everything
that I did
I said Kristen you should do this
because you would be great at it I think
that just self-consciousness and lack of
identity are two things that I've kind
of overcome the next question is what is
one of your biggest struggles or
weaknesses and this is a hard question
too because like you don't really want
to admit your weaknesses and you don't
want to really admit your struggles but
I know right away what my biggest
struggle is and that is comparison
comparison comparison comparison I think
that social media makes it very hard for
young people to have a clear expectation
of what life really is like and what I
mean by that is that like I said before
social media portrays people's lives as
what they want their lives to look like
it makes their relationships look
perfect it makes their vacations look
insane it's just like an unhealthy
comparison because it's not even real I
mean it is probably real that they are
in this relationship and they are happy
but that doesn't mean that they don't
fight or get into arguments or are sad
sometimes so I think that's the hard
part of social media and if the part
that I really struggle with because I
don't want anybody comparing themselves
to me and I don't want people to compare
their relationships to mine and Marcus's
because I just think that that's so
unhealthy and everybody's relationships
are so different and I feel like people
just forget that and the route of
comparison is just kind of
ungratefulness for what you have and I
just think that Jesus has blessed us all
with just the ability to wake up in the
morning and live our lives that right
there is a huge blessing though I want
to encourage you guys if you do struggle
with comparison I
that I do it's a struggle every day to
try not to compare myself to other
people I just encourage you to be more
grateful for the things that you do have
don't look at other people's lives and
say oh I wish that I could have this or
that because what you have in life is
special and important and it will suck
all the joy out of your life if you just
live your life comparing yourself to
everybody else and the last question is
what legacy do you want to leave and I
love this question I think that this is
such a cool question because I feel like
this is something that I really don't
think about very often and definitely
the legacy that I want to leave is just
one that reflects the love of Jesus if
I've even made one of you guys feel more
loved or more special or more worth it
than that makes my whole youtube channel
so worthwhile especially just right now
doing YouTube and social media I do want
to make a positive impact in that area
of life because I do feel like it can be
a really sad negative kind of like a
toxic environment so I do hope to be a
positive light and the whole realm of
social media and it really just is so
easy to get distracted um from what our
purpose really is in life I feel like
it's so easy to just get caught up in
you know schoolwork or like
relationships or work work and I just
think it's really important for us to
think about these questions and I really
hope that you guys like this video I
know it is a little bit different but I
do want to start doing more of these
videos kind of just like heart-to-heart
with you guys
so we can really just be more open and
vulnerable with each other so I really
really love you guys and I appreciate
your support a million times
a million I just I really really do
appreciate you guys watching my videos
and supporting me so I love you guys and
I hope you have a great rest of your day
