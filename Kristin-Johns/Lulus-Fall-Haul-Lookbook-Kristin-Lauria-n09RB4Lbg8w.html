you some really cute fall outfits and
it's kind of going to be a mix between a
haul and a lookbook so I'll show you the
clothes that I got from Lulu's
individually and then I'll show you a
little clip of how the outfit looks all
together because I feel like this will
be more helpful in showing you guys how
I would style things and maybe it would
give you more ideas of different outfits
that you would like to wear this fall
though I got all these clothes from the
online store called Lulu's I did a haul
with them about a month ago I think and
a lot of you guys loved it so I wanted
to do another one so I'm so happy to be
partnering with them again to make this
video for you guys they have so many
cute fall clothes so the first app that
I want to show you is probably one of my
favorites so the first part of this
outfit is this shirt and it's just a
basic white t-shirt and it has some rips
in it it's super soft I got it in a size
small and I really wanted to get this
shirt because I feel like you could just
wear it with anything you can throw it
on with jeans but today I wanted to pair
it with a really cute skirt I just had
this skirt in my closet already I just
didn't get a skirt from Lulu's so this
one is just from Hollister and the
t-shirt just looks so cute tucked in to
a skirt and I paired the skirt in the
shirt with a choker and this is probably
my favorite choker that I got from
Louise I also got this one which is
really cute and I also got this one and
they just have really unique chokers and
then the final part is outfit are the
shoes I love these booties so much I
think they're so unique because they
have like the geometric wooden heel so
this whole outfit is super cute I know
I'm going to be wearing it so much so
here's what it looks like all together
okay so this next outfit is a super cozy
one and it starts with this sweater and
this is just the most cozy sweater ever
and I feel like this is the type of
sweater that you always see on Pinterest
but you never know where to get it
because there's like no link to it so
I'm really glad that I found it because
this is just one of the coziest sweaters
that I have and I love the turtleneck
and I love the color as well and so I
paired the sweater with these jeans they
have dog hair all over them of course
they're high-waisted black jeans and
they have rips at the knees and they
just fit super well and then the shoes
that I decide to pair with this outfit
are these black pewter booties and
they're so cute because they have
stitching around the top and the toe so
overall this outfit is so comfy and even
if you did want to make it a little bit
more casual you could always pair it
with some tennis shoes or something like
that so I love this outfit and here's
what it looks like all together
so this next outfit is a little bit more
casual and it's definitely appropriate
for warmer days in the fall so it starts
with this little bomber jacket and I've
never had a bomber jacket before but
Marcus has one and I always wear his so
I needed one of my own so this is the
one that I got it's a really pretty like
topi silver color and also has rose gold
details which i think is really cute and
I just paired with it a little white
shirt and some denim shorts that I
already had in my closet and I also
paired it with this little neck scarf
that I got from Lois I love neck scarves
even though I had never had one now I
think I'm addicted to them because they
really do add such a cute little detail
to your outfit I think that they're so
sweet so I got this floral print one and
I also got this black one and then the
shoes that I paired with this outfit are
these little white tennis shoes they're
by the brand Superga and I never heard
of this brand before but I saw these all
the lose website and I thought they were
so cute because I'm just addicted to
white tennis shoes because they go with
everything so I wanted to keep this
outfit very casual so I thought that
these would be the perfect thing to go
with it and so here's what the outfit
looks like all put together
Oh
okay so I'm down to my last outfit which
is actually kind of sad because this is
really fun but this outfit starts with
this turtleneck sweater just super
oversized and slouchy I know that this
is something that I'm going to be
wearing a ton because it will just go
with everything but also be super cozy
and then I'll Caird the sweater with
these oversized ripped jeans that I
already had in my closet these are
actually from a boutique in LA but I
found some online that look like the
exact same so I'll be sure to link those
down below and also I paired it with
this little oh baby me I think that this
baby is so cute and I especially love
these for the fall and winter because
they keep your little ears warm
I showed you all the clothes I also have
some random things to show you that I
got from Lulu's and the first thing is
this lip liner it is from the brand
obsessive compulsive cosmetics and I
used to use their lip tars I don't know
if you guys remember those but they were
like the original liquid lipsticks and
they came in those tubes but I never
hear about them anymore so I just wanted
to try out one of their lip liners and
this is in the shade Lydia and I thought
it was going to be way dark because the
little tip of it looks very dark but
it's actually just a really pretty like
bobbi purple color I also got an eye
liner and this is from the brand ardency
in and this is the Rocklin waterproof
liquid liner and I've been using the
same that liquid eyeliners are so long
but I'm excited to try this out and it
looks really black so that's promising I
also got a white Beauty Blender and a
beauty blender cleanser and I wanted the
white Beauty Blender because I've tried
the pink one I've tried the black one so
haven't tried the white one and I love
the Beauty Blender I use it every single
day for my foundation my concealer and
my powder so I can never have enough of
these little things and I also got this
the world's most random thing but it's
this power gloss universal power bank
and you just put these in your purse and
it just holds battery so that when your
phone dies and you're out about you can
charge it with this I also got something
else that's super random but I'm going
to Hawaii in about a week so I needed a
new swimsuit and so I got this one oh
and it's just a little black bikini and
it has some straps right here and then
the bottoms look like this it's just
very simple and I just needed a new one
so this is the one I got and then the
final thing that I got is actually a
laptop skin but I already put it on my
laptop because I figured that you guys
could tell what it looks like better if
it was already on my laptop so this is
what it looks like it's just a
marbleized laptop skin and I love it so
much guys I
wanting a marbleized laptop skin or like
laptop case for a really long time
because I just think that they make your
laptop look so nice and I love anything
marble okay guys that is everything that
I wanted to show you what my mouth feels
so dry because I've been talking for so
long but I really hope that you guys
