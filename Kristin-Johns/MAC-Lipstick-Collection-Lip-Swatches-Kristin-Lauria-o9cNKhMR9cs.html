really know what to call this video like
a Mac like collection and swatches video
or like my thoughts about my matte
lipsticks I don't really know what I'm
gonna call this video but basically I
went through and I showed you guys all
my MAC lipsticks and I told you my
thoughts about them and I tried them on
my lips for you that is why my lips are
stained hot-pink right now so I hope
that you guys like this video I know
when I first started out in makeup I got
really overwhelmed at the MAC store
because there's a ton of lipsticks and
things to choose from so I hope you guys
liked this video and let's just get
started so the first one today I am
wearing right now and that is pure Zin
and this is a cream Sheen finish and I
would say this is more of a peachy nude
color and when I first started wearing
lipsticks peachy nudes and pinky nude is
the only thing that I bought because I
thought that that was the least scary
lipstick color but now I don't really
think that these types of colors suit me
as much but I kept this one because I
think that it's good to mix with
different like darker lipstick colors to
make it a little bit more light but if
you have a lighter complexion I think
that this color would be really really
pretty on you or just if you like nudes
in general I feel like this is a very
good one the second color I have today
is also a nude but this one is a little
bit more pinky and this is Hugh by Mac
this is a glaze formula so it's also
really comfortable and I think this was
the first lipstick I ever bought from
Mac you can see I kind of used a lot of
it but now I just don't think these
colors look very good on me but if you
are looking for a good pinky nude hue is
definitely a very good one to choose
this next color is called brave and it
is a satin finish so it's a little bit
more um like between a matte and a
glossy shine so it's what it sounds like
it's like a satin finish I think that
this is a perfect color if you're just
looking for like a very natural-looking
lipstick and still like a little bit
more polished
I feel like brave is a really good
option this next color is called MIDI
mauve and it is
Lester finish and this lipstick is so
comfortable to put on it feels like
you're putting on a chapstick and this
is just like my perfect color I love
mauve colors I love any neutral colors
like this so this is definitely one of
my favorite ones I'm sad to wipe this
one off because I really like it
this next lipstick is called syrup and
this is one of my favorite lipsticks for
Mac I wear it all the time and it's kind
of like a mauve color but it's mixed
with like a little bit of a lilac and
this is also a luster finish so it's
super comfortable on the lips and this
is max cream in your coffee and it is a
cream shade finish so it's a little bit
more opaque than some of the other ones
but this is one of my all-time favorite
colors I wear it all the time as you
guys can probably see like Mavi pinky
plum tones are like my favorite to wear
I wear them all the time but if you were
looking for just like the perfect
lipstick I would highly recommend cream
in your coffee this color is called
whirl and it's a matte finish and I
really like this color I got it pretty
recently I haven't worn it a ton of
times only like two or three times
because I feel like it needs a special
occasion because it's a pretty bold
lipstick at least for me and um I feel
like it's the perfect like nineties nude
brown color that everyone loves right
now and it's really comfortable for a
matte finish it's like it doesn't feel
drying or it doesn't feel like it's
gonna like crack off your lips this
color is called luster and it is a
luster finish and I wore this a ton and
summer and I think that's why it's
melted and really weird-looking
it's just like the perfect summer day
lipstick I think it's not too
overpowering like a lot of pink
lipsticks can be but it's pretty
wearable for being like a almost hot
pink color this next color is called
neon orange and it's an amplified
formula and that's exactly what it is
it's a neon orange lipstick I saw when
the Mac ladies wearing this and it
looked so good on her and I was like mom
I really want that lipstick and it was
my 16th birthday so she was like okay
just get it so now I have this
and it is very bold I mean it's a really
good formula if you're looking for a
bright orange lipstick it feels really
comfortable on the lips but I never wear
this lipstick because I don't know I
don't know when I would wear it next
color is another shocker it is called
candy yum-yum and it is a matte formula
and this is your good old neon pink
lipstick I remember the lady at Mac saw
me looking at it and she's like II want
you put it on you and I was like uh I
don't think that that will look very
good on me and she put it on me and I
was like huh I kind of liked it like you
know when you're in the store you're
like I should just get this and so I got
it
overall it's a really good formula and
if you're looking for a crazy bold
lipstick then candy yum-yum
is perfect this color is called rebel
and it is a satin finish and I love this
color so much wear this color a lot but
I just use it as more of a stain so I'll
just like dab it on my lips instead of
doing it this intense but sometimes I do
wear it like this and I also feel like
it makes your teeth look white and I
just think it's overall really
flattering so that is rebel by Mac X
color is Viva Glam 1 and it is a matte
red color and if you ever see a picture
of me in a red lipstick it's probably
this one because I just love it so much
it's so comfortable it lasts forever
it's cool toned so it makes your teeth
look really white and I would just say
this is the perfect red All American
color so that is Viva Glam look this
color is the classic Mac red it's called
Russian red I think it's a little bit
more warm than Viva Glam 1 but it's
still really wearable and if you're
looking for a little bit more of a warm
red I would choose Russian red and if
you want a cooler tone then I would
choose Viva Glam 1 but they're both
really good really good classic red
colors hey guys that is the end of the
video I just I and so I hope that you
guys liked it and if you did please give
it a thumbs up I would really appreciate
it and don't forget to send
scribe for a new video every single week
and I will see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
