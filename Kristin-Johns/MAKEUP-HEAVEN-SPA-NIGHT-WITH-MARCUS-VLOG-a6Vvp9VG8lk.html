because I have a lot of fun stuff
planned for today I'm actually going to
the North Durham anniversary max glamour
day event I'm super excited it should be
so fun
so I gotta get ready and I got it out
I'm just going to do a really quick
makeup today because I don't have so
much time the funny thing is when I go
to these makeup events I'm always like
oh this is the time that I need my
makeup to look really good makeup event
they're usually the times that I don't
have that much time to get ready stuff
just going to be very quick today maybe
I could turn you guys around and just
show you madness that's happening in
here all of that makeup I have to put
into that I've time to make them up
there I haven't even changed the month
to the correct mumble I'm so much behind
so I just finished my makeup now I just
have to do my hair and I wanted to shame
that I've been doing it because I've
been getting a lot of questions for me
and this is all I did want I put it in
French braids overnight and then I just
take them out in the morning and that is
it so fast I hope I don't have to keep
curling it amazing okay so here is my
outfit I love these shoes so much
they're so cute and now I gotta go I'll
miss you I'll miss you so much
you're a stupid weirdest thing up
everywhere which is awesome it's kind of
loud and you're so on
some of the products that are on sale
I'm super excited try out so okay we
guess we have so many amazing products
on sale right now I don't know if you
guys remember but I actually got one of
these water bottles in my last step it's
one box and I love it I have a bunch of
skincare tools and they even have some
glam well on sale which I know is super
popular
okay so I am back in my car I'm leaving
the Grove now and this girl is hungry
because I totally fatty breakfast and it
is now almost 2 o'clock so that's a
problem should I go get some food but I
had so much fun at the event the
Nordstrom is offering some amazing sales
for an anniversary sale especially
beauty products and I know a lot of new
love beauty products so I would
definitely suggest checking it out but
once I get home I'll show you all of my
goodies make the funniest noises all the
time ok so it's a little bit later on in
the evening because I had to come home
and edit and post a video so I've been
doing that for a while
but now I can finally sit down and show
you what I got today and I'm so excited
because I might be really sure what's in
here so I was just throwing things and
so the first thing that I got in this
bag is this Sigma spot express brush
cleansing mat and it also comes with a
brush in it which is really cool and it
comes with brush look and it comes with
brush shampoo and this is actually
perfect because I have no instances to
clean my makeup brushes it takes so long
and my hand gets all wrinkly is the map
that you put inside of your sink and it
accepted into your sink and you just run
your brush over all of these different
little sections and it cleans your brush
perfectly I got this which is a set of
waist face mask which I am doing one of
these tonight and so
guidance and this is the me oh wait
that's a different language it's the
media clear anti blemish device proven
declare skin in just 24 hours
works on contact unlimited blue LED
treatment and I'm so sad because I had a
bit right here but now it's pretty much
gone it went away super fast but I wish
it was still here so I can use this on
it but this looks very interesting also
picked up the mask look in a box which
the max makeup artist put on my eyes so
this is what the package looks like it's
$36 but it's a 62 dollar value and it
comes with these things in here it comes
with a little mac eyeshadow set this
would also be really nice for your
eyebrows use this in your brows and this
as your brow highlight and it also comes
with a mac liner and this is in the
shade long espresso I think this is one
of their long wearing eye pencil and it
also comes with this which is a mascara
from that and this wand is super tight
me though I think this is a great set I
also have one for your lips different
color ones for your eyes I got these lip
of masks which I've seen all over
Instagram and this was in their little
value section like 35 and under little
gift section and so I picked these up
because I thought that these would be
fun to try out tonight as well and the
last thing that I got is the foreo or
foreo luna play and this thing is so
cool it's a little vibrating face
cleanser but it's travel sized so the
battery at last
I forgot how long he said I think she
said a full month charge and then you
dispose of it but I think that this is
really cool for travel because you can
just keep it in your travel bag and
obviously you're probably not going to
travel for a month straight so this
could last you on a bunch of trips so
you don't have to bring the bigger one
there's also a bigger size of this and
drags Parkinson here to give him his
gift all right looks to the case okay so
I wanted to get you some gifts so that
you can
your skincare game could Asamoah tres4
dream well cuz I'm singing like at the
moment don't you ever miss at the moment
don't you just use like shampoo in your
face wash like just regular I I don't
use anything from it they so just do a
water and a rag that's all I do
yeah I overdo it it just complicates
things when I freaked out so I wanted to
give you some a little gift
oh good so I got this healed facial fuel
energizing face wash for men and it's a
pump so it's easy and like fast for you
I'll do it because you say so I got you
a Gil oh this is the Kiehl's men's
facial fuel do up and it's cool
packaging so into this exfoliator
and it also comes with a moisturizer and
and this is what I thought the guy told
me that the accelerator is good for
ingrown hairs and I know sometimes
believe humans here's what can happen is
you just tell me what to do and I'll do
it
okay good make sense okay good see it's
great I love it already
lasting about this for both of us this
is the facial fuel ID perfect and this
is soap I actually my resistance you
will like enough of you and he put this
on like the back of my hand is very
cooling it's pretty cool underneath your
eyes and like make many puffs so let's
get a little bit indeed possibly really
see you have some puffiness ringing I
always have puffy eyes
okay ready puppy that feels so good
right she's acting for me thank you
it's kind of like wet cold hey come with
you wherever you go
what I put in your bathroom
camper all right thanks mom put them in
your back okay which is also my laughing
have a sad story to tell them marketing
I do
oh is it the story its story this is the
best we're good
and Marcus sometimes take camper
skateboarding like Marcus skateboards I
walk in camper pools marks on skateboard
but for so long I always used to go long
boarding so I love long boarding and
Marcus bought me a longboard so that
we're going to do me longboard marks on
the skateboard camper pulling us so we
did that like an hour ago and then I
lost control of camper he was going way
too fast there was chaos can't him
explain
I'm able to hold camper on a short leash
and move him out of the way if he's
starting to run in front of a skateboard
but Kristen wasn't able to do that
because her arms aren't long enough so
camper went front of the skateboard and
she had to fail because she was gonna
clip camper until she bailed and was
going really fast and like ran like
police maybe like ten steps and then ate
it after that that process she was
really and when do you have to hit all
my gosh I don't know if I can show them
my hip appropriately but my hand as you
can see it my hand is all scraped up and
it hand hurts always hurt more than so
basically I really need a spa by now I
was gonna be like nah I'm just gonna do
a swap I was going to do a spa night
another night but now I'm about to go
wash my face put on that mask and
treatment okay so every good spa night
start with taking all of your makeup off
so I'm going to use my face wash and
look my spa partner is right by my side
my face is clean and I'm going to do
this lace your face facial mask in
brightening bearberry bearberry
the beautiful face mask it really is
least awarded you're going to freak out
when you see me they're like kind of
beautiful kind of horrifying wears not
for 30 minutes or more in to wear this
for so long
Hey look at this
you look like like Jason's but like the
beautiful versions of this lace no it's
scary I don't need to know why they go
try to make it like beautiful and lacy
it's just scary they should just commit
to the scare factor oh my gosh it's like
Jason's wife yeah it's like Jason's like
okay then 30 mess and I'm taking this
thing off
oh it's me under there so it ends my spa
night now I am going to give one more
back but this isn't for your face just
for your lips oh my gosh and I'm not
going able to talk after this stuff here
we go and then
you're slowly getting scarier whoa you
look like scary clown with that red in
there I think you need to go oh my gosh
I feel like my lips look really soft

my walk so I'm officially pampered for
the night you are forgiven for making me
