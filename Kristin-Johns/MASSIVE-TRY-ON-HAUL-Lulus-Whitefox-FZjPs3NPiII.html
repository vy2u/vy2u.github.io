to show you they're from Lube and white
fox boutique two of my favorite stores
of all time they are both so nice and
let me pick out a bunch of things so I
could share them with you guys and when
I say that this is a big haul it is very
big so I'm just going to jump right into
it or else we're going to be here for a
very long time
so I really hope you guys like this
video I know that you guys love hauls so
I think you're going to like this video
so I'll just start with Lula's because
last time I did a Lewis and white fox
Paul I started with white box so I'll
start with Lulu's this time and like
always I am going to be it trying on
everything that I show you in this video
so you can see also what it looks like
on and I'll also be linking everything
down below so the first thing that I got
from Lulu's is these shorts they're just
little denim shorts or Levi's and they
are a great length I needed some new
denim shorts because the only ones that
I really like right now are these ones
that I got from the thrift store a while
ago and then they got a hole in the butt
so I needed a new pair of denim shorts
and the next thing that I'll show you
guys are the shoes that I got from Lewis
because it's sitting right on top okay
so the first shoes I want to show you
guys are these sneakers they're white
and they have like I don't know what
this is called this like weaved texture
they're so stinking cool I've never seen
shoes like this I got them in a size
seven and a half and makes it perfect
they also have this little gold detail
which I love and I also picked up these
shoes these are Steve Madden and they
kind of have like a suede texture yet I
think they're suede and they have this
little silver thing on the back of them
they're very cute super comfy I love
shoes like this that you can just slide
on and wear with anything and I thought
these were a unique color so I love
these and these shoes I'm so excited
about because they bring back so many
memories I wore these shoes so much
growing up not these exact same ones but
ones very similar to this these are
these little black
slide on shoes and they have this like
stretchy material up here and I lived in
these shoes and I was talking my friend
Lexi and she said that she had a pair of
shoes just like this when she was
growing up as well so let me know if you
guys to remember wearing shoes like this
I also got these glasses from Louise I
posted an Instagram picture and then the
other day I don't really if you can tell
because of the huge glare I do need
prescription glasses but I don't think
I'd be brave enough to get this type of
glasses in my prescription um maybe I
would I don't know what you guys think
do you like glasses like this do you
like this like old like an old geezer
trend of glasses because I think it's
really cute these are all smudgy but
they're rose gold and these think
they're only like 9 bucks so if you want
to try out the glasses like this I think
these ones are really cute okay now we
can move on to the rest of the clothes
the first dress that I got is this
little how do you say it
jingle jingle dress I think that's how I
say it
it's just a little tiny dress it's
form-fitting and it's black-and-white so
freaking adorable and in the back it has
little ties and I actually wore this
with these black platform shoes too to
face I don't know if you guys saw some
pictures on the Instagram but it looks
really cute and I just think this dress
is so perfect for summer it fits very
nicely it's very flattering I also got
this dress which I love the color of
this dress is kind of like those suede
shoes that I got it's like this peachy
mauve color and I like pairing these
type of dresses with denim jackets I
also got a pair of mom jeans I have one
pair of oversized like boyfriend jeans
there in my closet they are very
destroyed bill like they have bricks all
over them they're very oversized I wear
them all the time but I thought that I
needed a pair that's not so destroyed
because when I walk around those some
people kind of look at me
whoo looks like you need a new pair of
pants so I got these they are adorable
they're very well made I haven't worn
them yet but I tried them on and they're
so cute so they just have these rips at
the knees and then they have a secret
rip at the back bottom on both legs I've
got a size 25 and they're perfect and I
love the wash of these as well they also
got another pair of overalls and these
are thinking so cool they have like a
very plunging v-neck and they are
bell-bottoms
as well so these are so cool I love
pairing overall with like cute little
flowy white shirts underneath or like
little striped shirts I think it's so
cute next thing I want to show you guys
is this little shirt from Lulu's it's
white and it has a very deep V with
these little tassels they have these
really cool sleeves that open up like
this you'll be able to see better when I
put it on but I love this shirt and I
think that this would look cute under
those overall I also got this little
two-piece set from rulers and you'll be
able to see this better when I try it on
but basically it's a little shirt that
ties in the front and then a long skirt
that's kind of roughly and the thing
that really made you want to get this is
the print in the color of it because I
love this peachy coral color it's just
so summery and happy and I really love
the two-piece set trend I'm really a
sucker for QP sets like one it's the
same print as the top and bottom so I
love this how to get it I got it an
extra small okay I have a few more
things from Lewis this dress is so
beautiful it's this white lace dress I
have blush underlay is that what it's
called and then it also has little gold
details around it and it's four-link
very beautiful I saw this on their
website and I just thought I know that
one day I'm going to have an event
or something like that and I can wear
this to it so you will be seeing me in
this dress
one day I don't know to what I'm going
to wear it too yet if you're looking for
a dress for an event or like a very
special date or something like that this
so pretty and the last thing from Lewis
I got this shirt so cute
I feel like this shirt embodies like my
true favorite kind of style it's just
this little very like slinky um colored
white shirt and it says yeah baby right
here and I just think that's so cute I
love shirts that have random like things
on them you know what I think that this
would look really good with like a pair
of high-waisted denim shorts or denim
skirt I'm so excited with okay I feel
like I'm moving through this pretty good
I feel like I'm going at a good pace but
now I'm going to move on to the white
fox things that I got and white fox
wanted to offer you guys 15% off
site-wide at using the code Kristen so
I'll leave that discount link down below
and I thought that was very nice but the
first few things I'll show you from
white fox are some swimsuit okay so here
is what this one looks like it's just a
plain white bikini it goes
Zoop right down the next line and it's
just white and plain and simple and
adorable and I also got two of the same
styles the different prints so I got
this maroon one piece I've just really
been loving one pieces and this one fits
very nicely very cute and basic and I
spice it up a little bit with this one
this one has little stars all over it
and I wish that I had this for the
fourth of July because that would have
been so perfect you guys have seen the
purse slash backpack that I've been
wearing for so long it's like that gray
backpack and it's the only thing that I
have been using for like four months
ever since I did my last haul from my
socks and it broke very sadly and then I
saw that they had a black one so I got
this little backpack and it's just this
is like the perfect everyday first in my
opinion it doesn't hurt my shoulders
like regular side person view I just
think I'm more of a backpack girl and
this is perfect perfect size perfect
like shape to go with cute outfits or
casual outfits and I'm just basically in
love and I'm still keeping my gray one
that the strap broke because um I'm
still obsessed with it and I'm just
going to superglue it and pretend it
never happened
okay now switching into more of the
actual clothes clothes I got this dress
it's like a light gray lilac color so
pretty
and it feels like a linen material and
it has these little straps it looks so
weird on camera but I have these little
straps that you tie around and tie right
here looks very cute I post a picture
wearing this on the Instagram the other
day and a lot of you were asking rip
from this next one is very special I
just did a photo shoot in this dress the
other day because I loved it so much
this is actually a beach cover-up along
like flowy Beach cover-up but it's so
beautiful and I just put a slip
underneath it in war as an actual dress
and it has buttons all down this and
then it has the little tie so you can
cinch it up the way it's still has wheat
stuck in it from from the field I was
laying in in the photo shoot but I love
this dress so much it's very unique and
I feel like when I saw it on website I
was like oh it's just like a really
pretty swim cover-up but then once I got
out I was like to know I'm going to wear
that as a dress so I just thrown the
little star swimsuit under this so you
can see what it looks like as a beach
cover-up but maybe you can also
visualize what it would look like as an
actual dress with a slip underneath it I
also got this little cross
sweatshirt I've been loving cropped
sweatshirt lately I just think they're
really cute and for summer they're not
as hot as a full link sweatshirt I also
got this strapless dress it's like a
very pretty
rest color and has a slit at the bottom
but then a little slip right here and
this one is very pretty actually haven't
even tried this one on yet so I really
hope that it fits I got this in a size
extra small and that has a little zipper
down the back I got two more things one
is this little white dress very simple
very like basic but I love it it's just
a great everyday summer sundress that's
what I would describe as that and the
last thing has me a little bit stumped
because I haven't been able to figure
out how to properly wear it but it has
hope because I know the model that's
wearing it in the picture looks so cute
so I still have hope that I'll be able
to figure it out and we'll see when I'm
trying it on for this video if it works
it's supposed to be one of those like
sweatshirt type dresses like where you
tie it in the front and it looks like
you have a sweatshirt tighter on your
waist but I can't figure it out there's
so many different slips and slaps and
ties and I can't figure it out so this
this is the closest I could get it to
the picture I still think it's quite
right though um what I'm still cute but
that is the last thing for this
ginormous haul if you're still here
checking along with me great job you
really suck through and I really
appreciate you and ending my videos you
want to make an experience yes ready
yeah that's a good one yes I was very
nervous I was gonna break the bed yeah
thanks every time we jump on it was a
little metal for the wooden things the
middle

bed a lot we did it sometimes I wish I
could jump on the bed yeah me too
we do have tickets Oh Jen I'm Matt and
er yeah you got really tan out of
nowhere

forgetting to say this in our collab
