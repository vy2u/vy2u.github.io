may favorites for you I'm going to show
you all the things that I have been
loving throughout the month of May and
I'm still here in LA why my under breath
I'm still here in LA that's why my
background is a little bit different I'm
in Marx's apartment right now and he's
not here so I figured I would film a
video for you guys so the first thing I
want to share with you guys is this and
this is the Beca beach tent shimmer
souffle and papaya / topaz and it's just
this really pretty gold coral color and
the texture of it is so weird you can
just like press on it and you can see
like your finger prints in it so it's
really cool and I just dip my brush in
there and it's just a really really
pretty gold coral color and it just look
so nice on your skin it looks really
natural and I've been wearing this on
days that I don't even wear any makeup I
just put this on and it just looks
really nice and it gives a lot of color
to your face so if you guys are looking
for a natural blush to wear in the
summer I really recommend these and they
have a ton of different colors but this
is the one that I have been using the
next thing I want to share with you guys
is something that you guys are like oh
my gosh finally and it's a new
foundation and this is the tarte what
are you called empowered hybrid gel
foundation and i have the color medium
neutral and it just comes in a little
jar like this and i have been using this
for the past few weeks and you guys know
I usually use the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation
but since I've been in California my
skin has been super dry so I needed a
more moisturizing foundation and this
one is super moisturizing so if you guys
have oily skin I probably wouldn't
recommend this one but if you are kind
of on the drier side then I think this
one is so good because it gives your
skin a really natural like dewy glow and
it's just super pretty
I actually really like the jar that it
comes in but I don't like that it's like
kind of messy but I'll forgive it
because it's so cute
the next thing I've been loving this
month is this and this is the color pop
matte lipstick in bumble and I showed
you guys this in my color pop lipstick
Tryon swatches video and I just love
this color so much it's what I'm wearing
right now and it's just kind of like a
brightest red color but it's not too
bright so I feel like I can wear it in
the day and not feel self-conscious and
I just love this color so much it's
actually not as dry as the one that I
tried in that video which was called
tulle I think
but I've been loving this color so much
I think it's so pretty for like a
summery day and I just really love this
color a lot the next thing I want to
show you guys is pretty glorious I must
say and it's my makeup geek eyeshadow
palette and I've never tried makeup geek
eyeshadows before and let me just tell
you they are amazing and one of my
favorites that I've been using every
single day is this color called frappe
it's just a really nice neutral brown
color that's all I'm wearing on my eyes
right now I love these and I'm
definitely going to be doing more makeup
looks with them very soon look a
dribbled this next thing is actually a
skin care product which I don't really
mention skin care a ton on my channel
because I don't really try out new
skincare very often but this is a serum
and it's from first aid beauty it's the
ultra Repair hydrating serum and it just
comes out and a little clear gel like
that and you rub it into your face and
it absorbs into your skin so quickly
which is like my favorite thing about it
my skin was getting really bad like dry
patches around my nose also on my chin
was just like irritated from the dry
weather because my skin was so used to
not dry weather so this has saved my
skin so much it says on here that it
replenishes smooths and softens your
skin and that's seriously what it does
it just makes my skin feel so like
hydrate
and it doesn't feel irritated it anymore
so I really feel like this saved my skin
when it comes to the dryness of my skin
so if you guys have irritated skin
sensitive skin or like kind of like
dehydrated skin then I would really
really recommend this serum the next
thing that I've been loving this month
is this and is what I use to whiten my
teeth I actually showed this I think
like six months ago in a favorites video
but I still get a ton of comments on
what I whiten my teeth with so I figured
I'd show you this is a brand new bag
because I ran out of my old one but I
just want to show you guys what comes
with comes with a little gel it also
comes with two little teeth trays that
you molds your teeth they put the gel in
comes with your little blue LED light
that I love so much and it also comes
with oh it dropped on the floor it also
comes with these little vitamin C q-tips
for if any of the gel gets on your gums
you just wipe it away with this and the
thing that I love about this product is
that it whitens your teeth so much
within like the first use of it so you
don't have to wait like six weeks to see
any results also in my last video that I
talked about this product they gave me a
discount code and that discount code is
still available it gives you a really
really good deal you only have to pay
like twenty eight dollars for the kit
instead of like two hundred something so
that was really nice of them and if
you're looking for something new to
whiten your teeth with I really
recommend that so the next two things I
have to show you guys are two clothing
items and the first one is this swimsuit
and this is by the brand Kourtney Jean
and it just has little cactuses on it
this is the top it's so cute and the
bottoms are these black high-waisted
bottoms and they have little like
ruching on the side suits are seriously
so cute I've been wearing them all
summer and Kourtney Jean has a ton of
different designs and patterns you can
mix and match and choose from the last
thing I have to
you is probably one of my favorite
things from this whole month I actually
got these a few months ago and I showed
you guys on Twitter and they're these
shoes they're by Rebecca Minkoff and I
usually never splurge on anything but I
was like I have to have these shoes and
they were actually 35% off when I got
them so I was like okay I got to do it
and they just looked like this say oh
they wrap around your ankle like this
and I posted a picture on Twitter awhile
ago and a ton of you guys were like oh
my gosh where did you get those but
right after I posted them and I was
going to post the link of them
afterwards I looked online and they were
completely sold out and I was like oh no
I feel so bad the reason I'm showing you
them now is because they are back in
stock and I don't know if they'll be
back in stock like forever or if they're
like I don't know I hope they don't go
out of stock again so that you guys can
get them but I will link them down below
they seriously go with everything and
even though they're super high they have
this platform here so they're not
uncomfortable to walk in at all and I
really just think that these are my
favorite shoes I've ever owned and
they're like just like my little babies
I love them so much so if you guys are
looking up for really cute new high
heels or whatever these are called clogs
I don't really know I really love these
and I will link them down below if
you're interested in getting them okay
guys that is the end of this video I
really hope that you liked it and if you
did please give it a thumbs up that
would help me out so much and please
comment down below any of your favorite
things from this month because I love
reading what you guys have been loving
too and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel for new videos every single week
