because I am finally doing another
favorites video it's been months and
months ten months since I've done a
favorites video but I decided to bring
it back to my channel because I love
favorites videos I love watching them
and I love filming them I don't really
know why I stopped doing favorites
videos I think I just got caught up
doing different types of videos but I
have so many favorites from the month of
April that I knew I wanted to share them
with you so I have pretty much the whole
range of topics to talk about in this
video I have beauty products accessories
books clothing house decor so let's just
get started in my April favorites boom
boom first thing I'll start out with is
makeup because I love makeup make it
makes me so happy and so I wanna start
with that this month was the first month
in a very long time that I started
wearing eye shadow again if you guys
didn't know I do get eyelash extensions
and they kind of they kind of cover up
my eyelid so I just didn't feel like for
a while wearing eye shadow didn't really
feel the need for it but this month I
started wearing eye shadow again and I
refill in love with eye shadow and these
are the two palettes that I've been
using non-stop and the first one I want
to share with you is the Anastasio
modern modern modern modern modern
renaissance palette it's a beautiful
palette full of very warm in kind of
almost pink tone colors and this is
actually the palette that I've used to
do my wedding makeup and Marcus's job so
this palette has a special place in my
heart but I've been using this palette a
lot this month but really the main
palette that I've been using the past
month is the Too Faced sweet peach
palette and I have heard a lot of people
talk about this palette but I have never
tried it before so I was so excited when
two-faced sent me this palette because I
was like I finally get to try it this is
what the power
looks like it's very beautiful it's
actually not necessarily the type of
shades I would normally gravitate to
because it seems like there's not a ton
of like wearable shades for me in this
palette but actually there's a ton of
them the main lenses has been using our
shade lucious which is a really pretty
like rose gold color which I love so
much and I've also been using the shade
caramelized which is a nice neutral
shimmery bronzy color and I've been
loving putting the shade summer yum in
my crease and the packaging is really
cute I feel like it looks like retro and
adorable so I've been loving this and
thank you this palette for giving me
back to wearing eyeshadow because I did
miss wearing eyeshadow I've also really
been loving the Too Faced melted matte
lipstick these are the shades that I
have a three I have the shade sell out I
have a shade queen be in the shade cool
girl and the thing that I love about
these lipsticks is because their masks
which I love because that means that
they're super long wearing and I love
how matte lipsticks look but the thing
about these is that they're not drying
at all and they don't make your lips
feel like they're cracking and crumbling
off they're so comfortable they're the
comfiest liquid lipsticks I've ever
tried and I really appreciate that cuz i
hate when my lips feel like I can aim
and smile without them like cracking
noticing so I love these so much if
you're looking for a new liquid lipstick
I would definitely say to try these out
because they're cute and they are very
comfortable and the last beauty products
I have to show you guys is this little
guy and this is the first aid beauty
ohana scope is the ultra Repair
intensive lip balm and I have been
having this in my bedside table and I
put it on my lips before I go to sleep
and I just wake up and my lips feel very
soft so that means it's doing its job
because my lips are feeling very dry
after I moved out to California just
because the air is much more part than
it is in Florida so I needed a good lip
balm
this one has been serving me very well
and next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is my favorite book of the
month and for this video I'm actually
partnering with audible which is amazing
because I love audible they are
sponsoring this video which I just think
is in saying it because I've literally
been using audible since my sophomore
year of college I remember downloading
audible and always listening to
audiobooks on my way from Tallahassee to
Orlando which is a four-hour drive so
the book that I'm going to recommend to
you guys this month is redeeming love by
Francine Rivers isn't even my favorite
book of the month because it's really
probably one of my favorite books of all
time it's a beautiful story based on the
book of the Bible Hosea which I love and
it's a really really amazing story about
the redeeming love of God and on to
people and I'm just telling you guys
you're going to need a box of tissues
when you're listening to this book
because it is just really really moving
but audible has a ton a ton of different
books that you guys can choose from and
they are giving my audience a 30 day
free trial if you just go to
audible.com/anna can download redeeming
love for free or any other books that
you would want to listen to again it's
audible.com slash Christian and if you
guys do listen to resuming love please
tweet me or comment down on this video
and let me know because we can bond over
the amazingness of it my next favorite
of this month are a few closing items
and the first one is just just has to be
this because this is totally one of my
favorites and it is this hat from Free
People it looks like this I actually
posted a bunch of pictures on my
Instagram of a little photo shoot that
me and Marcus did and I was wearing this
hat and I got a ton of comments about
where it was from so it is from Free
People I've been looking for a cute
black hat like this for so long but I
feel like finding the right hat is
tricky so I'm so happy that I finally
found a good hat
and the last thing that has to be with
clothing it's more like an accessory has
been chokers and I love chokers lately
like really I have been wearing them
almost every single day and the first
one is this one it's a little gold
choker you probably see me wearing this
in a ton of my videos because I wear it
like every day and this one is also from
brandy melville it's just like a little
satin light pink choker this would
actually be cute with my outfit now but
I love these they're so cute I've been
really loving like simple light-colored
chokers um rather than like black ones I
really didn't like any more like hats
Kelly one almost forgot two things in
regards to clothing I really almost
forgot okay I also want to talk about
the shoes that I'm wearing right now
they are these little one of these calls
are they called mules are they called
Quogue I'm not sure but this is what
they look like and guess where these are
from Target there's some Target and I
love them they're so comfy they're by
the brand Dolce Vita I think that's what
the BB stands for these are only $35
which i think is a steal because these
looks so nice and I love the pattern of
them see how they have this little
cutout
they're so cute and my final clubbing
favorite is this dress that I'm wearing
it is from Free People as well and it
has little flowers on the little flip
underneath it which I used to think
we're cherries but I love the layered
effect of it because it kind of looks
like you put more thought into your
outfit than then you really did and
that's what I love really
my last favorite of the month is um it
is kind of like home decor but also not
really cuz it's a candle and this is
from TJ Maxx but I wouldn't show this
unless I know that you can get it online
but this candle is from the brand DW
home and this is in the smell and neroli
and lime let's just say the reason that
I picked this up in the store is the
packaging because look how thinking
adorable this packaging is I'm a sucker
for all things cactus all things specula
and when I saw this I was like it's
meant to be this is what the actual
candle looks like I've been burning it
every single day it smells so fresh and
citrusy and I love it so delicious and I
love how the actual candle itself also
has little cactuses and succulents on it
so that has definitely been another one
of my favorites and I looked online
because I was like when this turns out I
need another one and so I looked online
and they have a whole range of these
types of candles and they also have ones
with unicorns on them they have ones
with cats on the outside so I'm going to
be placing an order from this company
very soon because I am absolutely
obsessed with these candles so those are
all my favorites for the month of April
if you guys love favorites videos please
give this video a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel I am
definitely going to be doing more
favorites videos because I love sharing
with you guys the things that I've been
loving from the month because that's
just very happy so I love you guys so
much I hope you have an amazing rest of
your day and I will see you very soon
