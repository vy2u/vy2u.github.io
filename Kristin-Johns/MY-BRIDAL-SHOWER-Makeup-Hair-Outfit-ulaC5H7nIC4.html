with me while I get ready for my bridal
shower I'm so excited
okay we're starting quick so today I
started with Mac strobe cream as my
primer I just think this primer gives
such a pretty look to your skin it just
makes it look very glowy and healthy and
it also makes the makeup on top that you
put on top of it not look cakey at all
so I love that and also my friend was in
here getting ready with me so that's why
I'm talking to someone throughout this
whole video and I'm also going to take
this little thing this is by Lancome I
think um or something like that I'll
link it down below but it's called a
juicy shaker and it has this really
really cool little applicator and I just
love it so much I think it's the coolest
thing so I just put this on to hydrate
my lips it's kind of like a little lip
oil so love that and then I'm driving my
eyes with my NARS smudge crease
eyeshadow base like I always do and this
will just keep my eyeshadow on all day
and today I'm actually going to be using
a different foundation than normal I
just got this one and I loved it so much
it's called Rebecca Rebecca one second
lemme look what it is it's the Becca
aqua luminous perfecting foundation and
I really really like this foundation
because it's actually way lighter than
any other foundation I've ever used
it's kind of like a mix between a tinted
moisturizer and a regular foundation but
it also just makes your skin look very
glowy and healthy and I really just
wanted to look bronzed and kind of like
you know just like a glowing bride today
so I wanted to use a foundation and I
really liked how my face makeup turned
out and it lasted all day really well
too so I'm also going to be taking some
concealer and this is the Naked skin by
urban decay concealer and I'm just
putting a little bit of that underneath
my eyes I'm not doing too much because I
didn't want to do any like crazy
highlighting or anything but I'm just
taking that with my Beauty Blender and
popping it all over my face just to make
sure it's all blended in there
and I'm so happy because I
got a new laura mercier translucent
powder and you can tell i'm very happy
about that because my other one was very
janky so i just put a little bit of that
in my cast of the powder and then i'm
putting a little bit underneath my eyes
and then like always just to set my
whole face and this is the best powder
i've ever used it doesn't look heavy at
all just makes you look nice all day
because it keeps your makeup in place
oh also I just thought it was a little
bit too bright in my room so I had to
turn off the light now
okay so just blendy blendy and then I'm
taking my benefit hoola bronzer on a
fluffy brush distance i'm morphe it is B
let me see it's the m-52 seven brush I
think that's their old numbering but
it's just a big white fluffy brush and
I'm just using that to brown my face and
I just brushed all over because like I
said I wanted this to be a very like
glowy bronzy look so that's what I used
and then I'm using this Tarte blush in
the shade captivating which is a
beautiful peachy blush it's one of my
favorite blushes of all time I'm used it
in a ton of my videos and I also use
this blush because it lasts a really
long time and I wanted my makeup to stay
on really good this day and then I'm
taking my little hourglass ambient
lighting the UM palette and I'm using
the highlighter in it because it's very
soft and nice and I'm just putting that
on the tops of my cheekbones and then
this is what I'm so excited about this
is the Anastasia modern renaissance
palette and I just got this terms before
the other day because I heard so many
good things about it and so I decided to
use it today and so I'm taking the white
shade in there called pintura earthkam
Pyrrhus and putting that all over my lid
and then I'm taking the shade raw Sienna
for my transition shade transition shade
and I'm just putting that in my crease
this is one of my favorite creatures
I've ever used in my whole life it's so
beautiful and it blends so easily okay
and then I'm taking this beautiful gold
shade and I'm putting it all over my eye
it's in the shade primavera I think
that's how you say it and this shade is
so pretty it's so subtle but also it
just really
makes you look very very glowy and I
just really like it and then I'm taking
the shade burnt orange just to add a
little bit a little bit of something
extra just to warm it up a little bit
and just to add a little bit more depth
to the eyes and then I'm just taking
some liquid liner this one is from two
positions from Physicians Formula and
I'm just putting a tiny line on my upper
you know upper lash line and I'm doing
this because I'm going to be wearing
some false lashes today because I have
eyelash extensions and they just really
look bad right now so I'm using the
lashes called Isabella from flutter and
then I mixed two MAC lipsticks together
today I used the shade C sheer and I
also put on top of that MIDI mauve and I
just thought it made a really pretty
nice little lipstick cocktail so that's
what I wore for my makeup today and I
really like how it turned out because it
was soft but at the same time is put
together so I really did like it and
then for my hair I just curled it
regularly but I thought I would just
kind of show you so this is me really
struggling to brush out my hair
and then I just wrap it around the
curling iron and I like to just drag it
down a little bit and I just wanted to
show you guys a little bit of it because
I'm going to be doing an updated hair
styling video very soon so I just went
around and curled my entire hair with I
think it's a 1 inch curling wand and
then I just kind of tousle bit out with
my fingers to make it a little bit more
loose and this is the dress and shoes
that I wore today the dress is from a
little boutique that I got a while ago
and my shoes are from Rebecca Minkoff
and I love them I think they're still
available so I'll try to find them and
link them down below but I just wanted
to include some little clips from today
to show you guys what it was like
because my my bridesmaids and my sister
who is my maid of honor did such a good
job decorating so here is some little
clips from today oh my gosh those
homemade somebody cupcakes so good
okay guys I really hope you liked this

thankful and happy right now but I
