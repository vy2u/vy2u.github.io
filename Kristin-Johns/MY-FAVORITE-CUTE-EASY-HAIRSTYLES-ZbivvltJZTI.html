hairstyle video which I've never done
before because I'm not a hairstyle
expert by any means I usually wear my
hair kind of like a variation of the
same every single day but I still get a
lot of questions from you guys asking me
how I do some of my hairstyles so I
figured it'd be just a fun thing to show
you guys but in the mornings I never
spend more than five minutes on my hair
and usually it's even less than that so
these are obviously gonna be very like
simple easy hairstyles that I'm sure all
of you guys can achieve with your own
hair a few months ago my hair was way
shorter than this I think it was like up
to here maybe and all these hairstyles
worked so I think that you can kind of
get away with all these with any hair
link okay just realized I don't even
have anything to put my hair up with
right now and I'm doing a hair video so
I should probably get back okay
got it okay so I always start out with
curled hair and I curl my hair with
usually a one-inch to like a one and a
half inch curling wand and then I just
like to brush out the curls so the first
hairstyle I'm gonna be demonstrating is
probably not probably definitely my most
worn hairstyle ever ever and it's just
the messy ponytail and I just love a
good messy ponytail okay so I get all my
hair to the back like this and I have my
ponytail ready and I just bring it up
pretty high like I like a good high
height on my ponytail and I just kind of
make sure everything is up of where it
needs to be okay so it looks like this
this is not my look so I always take the
top of my ponytail and scrunch it up
that's the first thing I do and then
kind of like loosen up the curls again
then you're left with something like
this which to me this just isn't messy
and it's
just not cute really so I always first
take my baby hairs out to give it more
of a messy look and then I go from the
back of my hair and I just pull out all
of this extra like all this extra hair
that was like really tight I like to
bring it a little bit looser and then
you just kind of finagle with it and
then I go back to my little scrunching
motion and then I just keep doing that
until I get my desired my desired height
up my ponytail and honestly guys this is
just really easy but I swear I have
gotten so many questions about this
messy ponytail look so basically you're
just like you're just kind of like
you're finessing it until you like how
it looks and I don't use a teasing comb
or hairspray but what I do use is dry
shampoo and I've been using this one for
forever this one's a little bit
expensive at Sephora but it actually
lasts a really long time and this is the
bumble and bumble credit powder and this
gives you volume and if your hair is um
like a little bit greasy it also kind of
helps with that this is exactly how I do
my messy ponytail and since this one was
so easy I decided to throw in a little
bonus little bonus tip and I love
ribbons ribbons are just so sweet and
also kind of nostalgic to me because I
used to wear bows and ribbons every
single day pretty much from kindergarten
to high school so nothing has changed
here and I usually get my ribbons from
you know thrift stores or you know
Lulu's actually has some really cute
ribbons as well but this one I got for
mister this one I got from a thrift
store I'd like to take it and run it
through
my hair tie and then you got something
like this and then you can just tie it
from there
or you can leave it hanging however you
want it and then you have a cute bow in
your hair
I actually saw someone do a recreate my
Instagram some of my Instagram pictures
which it was such a cute video and she
was trying to get her hair into a high
ponytail and I didn't realize how high I
put my ponytails like I guess it's not
that normal because she was like how
does she get her hair so high but now
you guys know the secret tricks okay so
the next hairstyle that I've just
recently been loving I think it's so
cute
you need some of these these are just
like clear little elastic bands all you
do is you just take from like kind of
like the end of your eyebrow back just
separate your hair this is kind of like
what my mom calls half-up half-down
so you just take about this much hair
and you wrap your little elastic around
the base and just kind of loosen
everything up make sure nothing's weird
take out any baby hairs that you want
and then I'm going to have to turn
around for this part and hopefully you
guys can see can you see okay so what
you're gonna do is you're going to
separate can you see the back of your
hair like this and then just flip
through your ponytail
so this is what the back looks like and
I really like this style for whenever I
want my hair out of my face but I also
kind of want to wear my hair down
because this way it's like all the front
pieces really stay out of your face and
then you can still have your hair like
down a little bit and I think that the
twist and the back just makes it a
little bit cuter than a regular um kind
of like half-up half-down so this takes
two seconds and kind of looks like you
tried a little bit harder than you
actually did which I like and you can
also do this exact little flippy thing
with your ponytail and you just put your
ponytail up loosen it a little bit and
then do the same flippin motion and then
it looks the same except your hair is
all the way up so I knew both a lot this
last hairstyle is also extremely easy
this is just pigtails but I feel like
pigtails have really gone a style since
elementary school and I'm gonna try to
bring them back because I think they are
so cute I just take my hair like this I
find I just split it down my natural
part and actually for this one I'm gonna
put in a little bit of dry shampoo
because for this one I think it's more
important to have more volume at your
roots or else it can just look a little
like bland so I'm just putting some of
this right there meshing it in okay and
then you take your little your little
your little clear elastic and wrap it
right about here I'll show you like
right below your ear yes then you have
something that looks like this don't
worry we'll make it we'll make it fresh
and cute in a second you're gonna do the
same thing to the other side right below
your ear so this is what it first looks
like and when you look at at first
you're like that's not gonna be good at
Kristen but trust me you can make it
cuter so all you have to do is kind of
the same thing that I've been doing this
whole time just pull out your baby hairs
and if you don't have baby hairs just
pull out like the hairs that frame your
face just kind of
you know mess it up a little bit I think
that the most important part is the
hairs that frame your face for this so I
just like to hold the base of the
ponytail and just pull out so this is
the final finished I guess you just have
to call this pigtails it's just pigtails
but I think that it's so cute and also
it just takes no time at all and it just
looks a little bit like fun and also it
gets your hair out of your face which
obviously you can tell I like that a lot
in the hairstyle and you can also add
like little ribbons to this I'll be
really cute so I really hope you guys
