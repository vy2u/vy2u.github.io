live because you know hey guys today
Marcus is going to be styling my hair
and we've done a few of these types of
videos he's done my makeup he's taught
me how to drive stick shift what else up
he's guest the prices of makeup so we
like getting each other up each other's
comfort zones right so today I picked a
few hairstyles for him to try to
recreate there's no rules really Oh son
I'm looking at a picture I'm trying to
reclaim yeah yeah grab a time woman or
just yeah till I get it done
are they really harder ago um I think
Emma I chose from V's to hardest weapon
so the first hairstyle I want me to try
out is a classic it's one I wear all the
time it's just a classic ponytail I mean
this can get it easier yeah I have a
little cup of hair styling tools like a
scrunchie some bobby pins some little
hair ties oh this is also yours to use
alright guys this is so easy I'm gonna
crush this so fast
be very gentle are you feeling confident
yeah the plan is just grab all the hair
throw it in a pill are you being
cautious of bumps are you with going for
the messy look I'm not for the messy
look but I guess you have to spin this
around it's not tight know how Oh
actually read a poem howl ooh wow I
didn't really see you have to like
double up this bow so you got to pull it
through twist it and then pull it back
through hmm this is like how I would be
really good yeah I do I do this pre mess
it up a little bit you don't look so
strange it was brave person I'm gonna
leave this stragglers there it's cute
it's literally just your hair looking
perfect let's throw in the vote Wow
right that is good I would say
very good yeah I got that the next
picture that you need to recreate is
also pretty easy one it's a messy bun
but these can be tricky think you can do
that what's wrong II think it looks
pretty hard no good cuz it's only second
level hardness all right second level I
feel so weird you doing this to my hair
I feel like this is something that girls
do from the front they lay their head
forward and do this we do okay so I'm
already at a disadvantage here a little
are you having struggles Wow oh wait oh
really
oh wait actually all of it okay that's
wrong with me see this is it
you gotta get okay hold on I've never
done this before I mean it's not there
yet so but I would never actually it is
terrible it really is because I would
never walk out of the house like this
look if I shake my head what's up okay
the next one is this it's like a half-up
half-down bun mini-money yeah
I'm less nervous now because I feel like
your styling is all about just starting
correctly if you start in the wrong
place with the wrong amount of hair and
the wrong part of your head
it gets doomed yeah it's totally doomed
okay I'm just I'm just going with this
hopefully it looks like this is my first
attempt well I feel like you could see a
picture of this hair on Pinterest and
you'd be like oh that's cute it looks
like a two-room your hair it's like a
hair tumor oh yeah I feel like I needed
to started up higher up trick is that
for this hairstyle you you don't just
start with a big chunk in the back of
your head you pull back this too and
then you pull back too much but I mean
weird when you did it in a unique way
you get points for the next one this
oh my word I'm never um these are French
braids just like going like pigtails but
if you can't do French ragers I feel
like you said you could different phrase
I know how to braid regular okay so you
can just do regular braid are you good
at braiding no I don't think I've ever
really successfully braided some
the way to your brain right now is that
yes you have so much hair person holy
crap you're let's have assure you that I
have so much hair I know what first one
and the monitor is looking that's
like you have licked in them down like
ass you down this little bit on gravel
because the loosest braids I've ever
seen in my life
what does it look like from the front it
looks have you ever seen a braid bad
news no it's a style I just invented it
bitch
it's not horrible right like if I came
out looking like this what would you say
yeah I just say like I feel like you
look very like Swedish right now I know
I look like a milkmaid yeah you just
going this not the natural hair style
see that yeah look I'm good I did I mean
I could see a girl being like I want
really loose free braids and then you
get it in for the next hairstyle you
have to do this and I would say this is
a mixture between a deep and a messy bun
feel like it was a very bad braid that
went wrong but just like this threw it
all together and just said yeah that
looks okay did you think you can do this
I feel addressed you want to integrate
the braids into yeah I actually do I
actually do think you can be very
successful with this if you put your
mind to it
this could be your best one yet need
chubsters oh you need body boots oh oh
that's what you use to get it up it's
the Tripucka bobby pin you're not
supposed to see it yes that's the trick
I really think that that wasn't as bad
as it was gonna be
let's see it
miel it looks decent from the front
right what you love this I don't love it
but I think I made it look sort of like
the photo that's right but the back it
looks like you gave me a fake short
haircut like a fake Bob right there did
it I was trying to like hold things that
look kind of magician like in this world
there are nice little mini boy yeah yeah
I think they're like probably 15 how do
you feel about hair styling
yeah it's a lot harder than I thought it
was especially with long hair right it's
so hard okay guys I hope that y'all
