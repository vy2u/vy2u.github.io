very interesting one because Marcus my
fiance is going to be doing my makeup
voiceover so I just filmed myself
putting on this makeup and then I'm
going to hand the footage over to him
and he's gonna do the voice-over
explaining to you guys what exactly I'm
doing and I've seen a bunch of these
videos on YouTube so I really wanted to
do this with Marcus because he really
does not know much about makeup but I
really hope you guys like this video
give it a thumbs up if you do and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel also
if you're curious about the actual
products that I've used in this video
since he might not really know exactly
what I'm using I will link them all down
below but without further ado let's just
get in to the makeup tutorial hey guys
covering a Lawson in shirt what is
squishy foam I knew I'm gonna grab this
for gold goop and push it on the fat
side up while you see it there we go and
then I'm gonna put more glue because I
shouldn't put enough on there oops
squishy squishy squishy wikki wikki
wikki tiny and I put so much in and put
some circles on the cheeks and then
across in the t-zone oh I'm so happy
Oh dot dot dot dot and then here's some
more brown goop this is called naked I
put it under my eyes like so and to to
to to to
and underneath here cuz it gets a little
red sometimes see back to the squishy
ball now then we're gonna go underneath
and that's perfect on the chin and I'm
gonna just blend this out underneath my
eye and when you're doing this guys make
sure to make your eye look really
squishy over there okay now we're done
with that and I'm getting OOP I don't
know what is this table that's so silly
and you can see okay now I'm going to
put the ball and put the powder on and
put more powder on top of the golden
goop okay
and we're fluffing the powder
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu by squishing like a
squishy ball hmm maybe we can do a
little bit more on the chin there okay
for ever
on the forehead that's looking good oh
yeah I'm surfing I'm surfing on this
powder now oh this hoola stuff you guys
really love this oh yeah all right now
get this cool fluffy brush you pluck the
brush in the other pattern tap the top
of the box and make sure it works and
then you do your cheeks like so go
across the forehead and hold your hair
back because you don't want this inside
of your hair call on your neck and kind
of blend it on your neck and you think
anything anything to do all over your
face now grab your other fluffy brush
that's been stained pink and open up wow
I love this oh it's so special I said
well before Kristin did I know her so
well and then you're gonna get this pink
and blush your face and it's gonna happy
I love washing my face and to to to to
to to to cross making sure that it
blends your face nice and smooth and I
did this tiny miiverse just another tiny
brush in some more gold tap tap and I'm
gonna brush it on my cheeks one on one
side one in the iron kind of contour my
nose and cheeks a little bit grab your
eye brows a little bit and oh wow look
at this - oh it fell oh my gosh is so
much trouble now and then I'm gonna oh
this is heart of it up I really stink at
this cut to something else because I
can't fix the situation and then once
you get it all fixed you put it on your
eye brows to make them look like big
brown sticks so it doesn't look like you
see individual hairs but it's just one
giant brown line like a cartoon and then
you're gonna grab this and brush your
eyebrows so that it looks more uniform
and more like a stick okay now that we
did that I'm going to grab this half
black half white tube and pull it out
and I'm gonna put some on my finger like
this and flip you guys off and then I'm
going to put it on your eye and then
when you put on your eye it what this
does is it
and make sure that it collects more of
the white and gold powder that you put
on your face and then I'm gonna put more
white powder on my eyes this is the 17th
layer that I've done of makeup and it's
so nice now I'm going to mix this with
some more layers and a little it's going
to be really redundant you probably
don't need to do this and you're going
to do so many layers and really all you
need to do is probably one but because
this is a makeup video I have to make it
seem like it's really hard to do so you
guys are like wow
only Kristen can pull it off okay now
that I've got my seventeenth layer I'm
gonna be grabbing this this brown stuff
and then oops I got a little bit my
eyebrow let me wipe that off okay there
you go and now I'm gonna flip the hair
out and you're gonna want to brush out
your lower lashes to make them look
plump in full no you're gonna kiss the
camera get this little pencil and wipe
your lips so they're not wet and draw
underneath the bottom side your lips
like this because that is what makes
your lips look very beautiful and I'm
going to do the top two and make sure to
feel a little bit outside the lines yay
to make your lips look a little more
plump and then I'm gonna get my kylie
Kardashian stuff
smack it a few times because she's a
real bad girl and then I'm gonna get and
put it on my lips oh one second guys I'm
putting on another layer of Kylie
lipstick when I put this on my lips hmm
