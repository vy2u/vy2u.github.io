so today I thought it would be fun if me
and Marcus go to the mall together and
we split up and then he walks around and
tries to find me some clothes and then
I'll try them on and see if they're cute
or not so the catch is I have to be by
myself
I get a two hundred dollar allowance I
have to buy this stuff cold hard cash
where's the cash you have the cash no I
buy these things she doesn't get to see
him I really don't know her sizes she
hasn't told me anything I'm pretty sure
I know what she is for most things and
then we take it back to the house and
see if she likes it how does it sound
I think I'm gonna pick everything that
she's gonna like really I think it's
gonna be a mixture between I think
you're gonna like it but it's also
something that I want to see you wear
really yeah is that okay it's like a
mixture of both yeah so maybe you might
not be getting the exact thing that you
would want but I feel like maybe maybe
I'd like to see you in that so we're
going to get three outfits well you're
gonna get three outfits with 200 bucks
yeah okay so but I would be vlogging in
the mall so you guys will get to see
what I'm picking your thought process
yeah hold everything
jagged points for everything you like
brownie points yeah get bad food and
their account with my birthday presents
okay perfect so I don't have to get you
a birthday present this is your birthday
present right now Hecky oh this is the
best video ever dude we have to think
about it you just basically decide okay
all right that's good it's good oh yeah
we're on our way
how are you feeling so calm just getting
to the mall now about to split up see ya
later tater
already see you bye I'm gonna do so good
this is the first stop right here
let's do this one thing I know about
Kristen is she always loves white cream
and lace so you can never go wrong with
anything like this so I think I might
get something from here get Kristen this
baby diaper I don't know guys this is
way harder than I ever thought I see a
price markdown some good freakin grab
this because Kristen would absolutely
wear this it's like not the most amazing
thing but I think it's just a solid
shirt that she would wear I don't know
if she'd like these but I'm just gonna
go ahead and get them cuz they're 15
bucks and why not
right right all right there we go all
right so we're walking out of forever 21
and I realize that I just made a bunch
of random purchases I don't even know if
things are gonna go together I just
solve different elements like I think
Kristen would wear this so I spent one
hundred and forty-one dollars in forever
21 which gives us $59 left to go spend
so let's see what I can get
so already being in Urban Outfitters for
like five seconds I think I'm already
regretting a lot of the purchases I made
it forever 21 just because I feel like
this is more of Kristen's Ally these
kind of floral patterns kind of lighter
colors so see you a week it's been 60
bucks on all right I got the stuff you
ready don't look in the bag stinky
I did I'm actually like nine dollars
under budget I think
yeah all right ready okay hope you like
it
are we leaving enough time perfectly got
three outfits exactly but have like when
I was shopping I was just looking for
elements that I think that you would
wear but I also took risks I took
fashion risks I took things that I said
I think Kristin would wear this but she
would be like should I get this I don't
know and now I won't get it I got those
types of things okay but do you like it
for short I mean I think it's okay yeah
I don't really know I like when you shop
for yourself
okay I don't like this pressure I really
didn't like shopping I don't like
shopping at all all right ready yeah
yeah let's try this in this together
okay all right what do you think are
those terrible I just thought autumn
looking at white color jeans I knew I
need to give you some tips candies are
cute are they good they're like
boyfriend jeans good and this you played
it safe but this is cute mm-hmm you got
the bargain Hey mm okay I should go try
this on you actually bought jeans that
fit yeah I know I'm so good that's
really good the shirt is cute but it's
like it's a small it could've been
tighter but guess what will you wash
that puppy twice see you later
you're looking perfect let's just throw
this out here now I just saw this hat
and I figured well maybe I should just
get you a hat because you hate hats but
I thought that maybe it'd be nice to
have a hat looks nice ready for the
beach
okay this is your this is your night
time thing ready okay
whoa is it too small it's okay to look
so cute is that good for nighttime or no
yeah I think it's easier though you're
gonna keep it is it - sure maybe so is
it a keeper or no yeah BAM that's two
outfits you like right the other one
didn't you like okay the last one I'll
give like a six this one's like a eight
okay yeah okay BAM there you have it
all right let's see the next one have a
seat all right the last one well there's
like two things this isn't a full outfit
but these aren't going to go together
but I know that you like I thought that
you would like these I can't remember if
you have these already or not but do you
have these already
no but you like sunflowers yeah thank
you
right yeah so just think of that as a
separate item I also said I think that
you would wear this as a separate item
as well I'm not together obviously let
you hate this I would never wear it what
really funny because you were wearing
like a very cute thing the other day
yeah so you like words I thought maybe
it's sunny in LA this is like a casual
shirt yeah yeah like a sleep shirt yeah
sleep shirt there you go
this these I thought maybe you would
wear with either after probably the
jeans to pay fees no where's my
potential yeah you'll find purpose I
don't know if there was a third outfit
there would be this wouldn't be I mean I
like it you know it's like a Christmas
gift if you get it you're like yeah I'll
make it work you know like you wouldn't
choose it obviously but well ding Chris
the shoes obviously wouldn't go with
that well you'll you'll you'll be able
to that shirts fine you would so wear
that shirt for someone I like this shirt
I know you do and the pants you can make
it work with something else yeah would
you wear that together no I wouldn't
it's too but now let's see online oh ha
ha do you like this outfit like when you
dinner look weird rings uh no I wouldn't
think you look weird for $15 wow you're
really getting the bargain I know we
were in the car by the way and Kristen
was talking about something yellow and I
said Oh yellows your new color isn't it
Kristen she goes suits amigos know I've
said that to kind of prime this dress
it's a yellow dress so I thought maybe
I'll warm her up to yellow before she
even gets it but I don't know how it's
gonna fit yeah that's really quick it's
weird yeah it's weird I don't know it's
supposed to be like weird wait I think
it's missing a string you serious
I love it this is my favorite one really
yeah she likes the money so we got to
get that other string for the other side
though yeah yeah what the heck
okay so this is that's one of my
favorite ones this one gets a tin up
10:02 yeah I love this very good job and
overall you get an a-plus hmm you did so
good thank you yeah okay good you have a
really good sense of style and
everything fit really well it's good I
just pick small everything I highly
recommend you bet I go shop for you know
that you play this with your boyfriend
so your boyfriend can go heist new
clothes yeah fun game yeah bet for you
yeah it's very stressful in the guys
part and you're also walking around very
awkwardly with like a bunch of like
women's clothes and people are just
looking at you like huh you find
