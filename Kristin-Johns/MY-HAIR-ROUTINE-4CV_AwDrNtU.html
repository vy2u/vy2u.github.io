your daily dose of camper so say hi
camper
he's getting so big he weighs 34 pounds
now and when we got him he weighed 13
he's giving like a big dog
okay just had to show you all him
because he's sitting right underneath me
just just know that hey guys today I'm
going to be telling you all about my
hair all of the products that I've been
using and loving um and pretty much just
anything that I can think to inform you
guys about what I do for my hair because
I actually get a lot of questions about
kind of just like what is my hair care
routine because I haven't done one of
these videos in a long time and last
time I did this video I had super super
long hair I'll insert a picture if you
guys maybe just started following me and
you never saw me with super long hair
but I had very long hair pretty much
down to my butt for a really long time
and I just recently got it cut I
probably got like 9 inches cut off of it
now it's right here and I like it as
this links way better and I feel like I
can do a lot more with it that kind of
brings me to my first point about my
hair which is the texture of my hair is
very soft very fine but I have a ton of
hair like when I wake up in the morning
it's just straight in the past few
months I feel like I have found a lot of
products that really helped me achieve
soft but voluminous and texturized hair
which is pretty much what I always
wanted I also get a lot of questions
about if I dye my hair or not and I do
not dye my hair this is my natural hair
color it's just brown keeping up with
like highlights and stuff is just very
high maintenance and I like very low
maintenance hair so I think I might just
keep it my natural color for a while but
yes this is mine
okay so the first product that I'm going
to tell you guys about are my shampoos
and conditioners that I use and I have
two different kinds that I kind of
switch out between the first shampoo and
conditioner that I absolutely love is
this and this is the living proof full
shampoo and conditioner right now I only
have the conditioner because I ran out
of the shampoo and I threw it away so I
just have a conditioner for now and I
need to repurchase it
I love the shampoo and conditioner
because I really do feel like it makes
my hair very voluminous and it also
doesn't make it feel dry because I've
noticed that a lot of volumizing shampoo
and conditioners can do that to your
hair but I really love this one it
smells really good it is on the more
expensive side this is actually the
first shampoo and conditioner ever used
that was more expensive than like $3.00
Pantene but I really like this I've been
using it a lot I mean I ran out of
shampoo so you know gotta love it and
then the other shampoo and conditioner
that I've used that I switch in between
using that is the Kristin s the one sig
signature signature shampoo and
conditioner I mentioned the Kristin s
wine and my may favorites video because
I bought a ton of products of hers from
Target when I saw them at the store and
I've been using them a ton and I love
them so this is a very cleansing shampoo
and conditioner which I really like
because I am using a lot of products in
my hair now like dry shampoos and
texturizers and things like that and I
feel like these really cleanse all of
the built-up gunk at my hair because
even if you do wash your hair with a
normal shampoo and conditioner it can
still kind of feel like you have buildup
or it just kind of gets a little bit
less shiny because you've been using dry
shampoo a lot and I feel like these
really just take all that out and just
let your hair start fresh so I love
these these are both I think $10 from
Target and I also love the packaging I
that they're really cute and they smell
great next thing that I'll mention are
the products that I use on damp hair
after I get out of the shower the first
thing is this which I don't use as much
as the next product that I'm going to
mention but I still really do like it so
I wanted to mention it
it's the mypie spritzer sea salt spray
by Drybar and I love this stuff because
you spray it and damp hair after at your
shower it smells very good but it gives
my hair grip like it gives my hair
texture so that when I wake up it's not
as straight as it normally is it's more
like it's not wavy but it's just more
textured you know what I'm saying I know
you guys noticing so I really like this
it kind of just you know sea salt spray
just gives you a more beachy hair look
and I really like this one and the next
thing that I use seriously every single
day after I shower I put it in the roots
of my hair is the Christian s instant
Lisp volumizing mousse I feel like this
is the number one product that oh my
gosh I feel like this is the number one
product that really gives me a ton of
volume like when I wake up in the
morning I can really really notice that
I have extra lift in my roots and I
forgot to use this last night so I feel
like my hair is kind of like what
voluminous the next things that I want
to mention are the things that I use on
dry hair to kind of style it or to
absorb my oil so I have two things like
that and that is the bumble and bumble
try to powder this is dry shampoo and I
think it's also considered a texturizing
powder as well and when my hair is oily
I just pop some this in my roots and it
is white you have to be careful and
really rub it in so you don't get a
white cast but I love this I think I've
had this for two years and I still have
half of a bottle left so this does is
expensive but it lasts a really long
time at least for me I guess I don't use
a ton of it but I feel like I have used
a lot of this also isn't this
bottle really cute and then another
product that I love so much I seriously
love this I think I've mentioned this in
a video as well this is the dry bar
trick trick book this is the dry bar
triple sec three and one it text rises
amplifies refreshes so that is exactly
true it really it just gives your hair a
lot of texture it really smells great
and I just feel like when I spray this
in my hair the bottom of my hair gets
more volume I don't really use it at the
root of my hair because I would use
something more like this for that but
this really just makes your hair less
like all in one spot at the bottom of
your hair does that make sense like
sometimes I feel like all my curls are
just like right here and I kind of want
them like spread out and be more loose
and wavy and that's what this does this
just give me a much more like relaxed
look instead of looking like you know
crunchy curls like that so I think
that's it for today's video if you guys
have any other questions about hair
leave them down below because I'm sure I
missed a question I get a lot of
questions about my hair and I think I
answered them all but I'm not sure so I
will be answering all your comments down
below all your questions but if you did
