my houseplant collection as well as
sharing some of my favorite tips and
tricks and just little advice advices
little pieces of advice that I've
learned on how to take care of your
houseplants and keep them alive because
that's probably my biggest question that
I get about houseplants is like I love
plants but I cannot keep them alive so I
feel bad buying them I've gotten so many
comments and questions from you guys
about that and I would say my love of
plants started sometime in college I
think it might have been like my
sophomore year of college but I was so
bad at taking care of them I had no idea
why all of them kept dying and probably
like a year and a half two years
straight of just like killing plants
plant after plant sad sad deaths so now
I finally have had a lot of these plants
for a while now and they're all thriving
pretty much so there are definitely some
that are harder to take care of than
others some that are easier I'll share
with you guys all the information as I
go through each plant also if you're
watching this video I just gotta say I
relate to you on a deeper level because
if you're watching this video you
probably love plants or want to start
loving plants and then automatically me
and you were best friends but I'll start
with this one right over here this
little guy is actually called a nerve
plant and plants also have obviously
more scientific names I know some of my
plants scientific actual names but I'm
not sure what the actual name of this
one is I have them in this terracotta
pot that I painted the top white which
if you want to kind of like spice up any
of your terracotta pops it's really easy
to just do something simple like this
this plant is actually really
interesting I've had it for a while now
and I always thought there was something
so weird about it because you'll just
wake up one morning and think that it's
completely dead because all of the
leaves will just be sunken down like
like it will just look completely dead
and then once you water it in
an hour all the leaves will be sitting
straight up again and I just think this
plant is kind of funny because it just
tells you exactly what it needs to be
watered now I'll show you my succulents
and I used to be completely completely
obsessed with succulents I feel like
they are kind of like the intro like
starter to house plants and for a good
reason they are supposedly the easiest
plant to take care of but I find that I
just don't have the best of luck with
succulents um a lot of them have died
I've been in my ownership and I've just
started to kind of not really buy as
many succulents as I used to this is my
first one this is called a donkey tail
succulent and he is very happy and cute
I actually had him packed away in a box
for a while and he wasn't really getting
much Sun or any water and then he just
started thriving so I water him about
once a month and the most important
thing about succulents is to not
overwater them that's like 99.9 percent
of the time why your succulents are
probably dying so you know the best way
to take care of a succulent is just kind
of like neglected it's good to be honest
I also have this one which I'm not sure
exactly what this one is called but I
remember when I got this one it was so
tiny and it's grown to be really
beautiful and kind of big so I have me
sitting on my kitchen windowsill cos
succulents love a lot of light oh I also
have this tiny little pot where I'm
trying to propagate some succulents I've
never tried to propagate succulents
before and I don't know I'm hopeful for
these I also have some cacti as well
this is one of my favorites I just love
its little pot that it's in so this is a
I don't know the variety of cactus but I
love this one and it's very easy to take
care of I give it like one tablespoon of
water like every two weeks and he's
living his best life and I also have
this cactus which is kind of new to my
collection and half
in this pot and this pot kind of brings
me to my next like plant care tip and
it's that planters a lot of the time
when they're really like cute and
decorative they don't have any drainage
holes I can't really tip this one over
all the way but see how it's just like
there's no holes at the bottom and that
means that the plant isn't gonna have
any drainage when you water it which is
I think the most important thing about
houseplants show you an example with my
little prayer plant so this plant looks
like this and I have it in a cute like
decorative pots but I also have it in
this little drainage pot which has a
bunch of holes at the bottom and so
whenever I water it I put this in the
sink and I just water it throw ease all
the extra water can drain out of it
because if you don't have them in pots
like this that's when your plant will
actually develop a thing called root rot
and that's when you just have a bunch of
water sitting in your plant soil and the
roots just get rotted pretty much and I
think that's the biggest reason that
people have a hard time keeping house
plants alive because you just want to
give it more and more water and take
really good care of it but really you
end up killing it because you a maybe
don't have the right amount of drainage
and B it will just like me sitting it's
like us sitting in a bathtub for a week
it's like we'll just get all shriveled
up and be really sick while we're
talking about this one this is called a
prayer plant or a calathea it's what its
proper name is actually got this plant
for $3 at my local plant store and I had
never seen anything like this and it
didn't have a name on it or anything and
I was like is this plant kind of messed
up because it's kind of like it's leaves
are like pointing in really weird
directions but actually these plants
close up at night and then
morning they then go back to like a
regular position so if you watch a time
lapse of a prayer plate it's actually
really cool you can see it moving a ton
and this one is growing a new leaf which
makes me so happy because that means
it's happy and healthy and I have also
heard that these plants aren't the
easiest to take care of but I've had
this one for about three weeks or maybe
like a month and it's doing great ok so
the next one in the bunch is a newer
addition to the family and this is
called a rubber plant and these are so
beautiful I don't know why I just think
that rubber plants are so pretty
this one actually needs to be dusted a
little bit but as you can see he's
growing a new leaf and he has a new leaf
right there too and this is actually
from Trader Joe's and if you have like a
grocery store that sells houseplants
they actually sell plants at a really
good price usually like I think this was
$4 and I also have this rubber plant
that was from Trader Joe's and this one
is much larger and this was I think
$6.99 from Trader Joe's so sometimes you
can score very lucky plant finds at
grocery stores these are both rubber
plants but this one is just a variegated
rubber plant and what variegated means
is just the leaves look like this like
they have different colors and they kind
of look like water colored and a lot of
different plants have variegated leaves
okay the next thing I'll talk about is
this one because this is just like the
little mystery plant and I just don't
know much about it at all I know that I
got it when we lived at our old house
but I've done so much research honestly
on houseplants and I've never seen this
this type of plant before I just have no
idea so if you're a plant expert please
let me know if you know what this plant
is but you can see it has variegated
leaves it has really pretty pink stems I
really like this one just because I'm
like
are you this one is called a peperomia
obtuse if folia or a baby rubber plant
because as you can see it's it looks
similar to a rubber plant the leaves are
just smaller and this one was hanging up
at a plant nursery and it was so
inexpensive and I found out it's because
they're very very common and they're
also very easy to take care of and very
quick to grow they're like all of these
smaller leaves have sprouted within like
the last week so this one is growing so
fast and I feel like if you need a good
like base starter plant if you can find
one of these ten out of ten would
recommend this is some ivy that my
friend actually picked for me and she
put it in this jar my friends really
know me so well
and it has grown so much I think it
started like this big like where my
fingers are and it's grown this much in
about a month so that shows you how fast
ivy grows and I guess this takes me to
my next point of propagation if you guys
were curious about propagation or if you
have no idea what it is basically when
you take a stem from a plant and you
replant it into another plant so this is
eventually going to grow roots because
it has a nod at the end which is that
little extra like doohickey right there
and so a lot of plants actually root in
water this is one of them and I also
have this which is rooting in water
right now I absolutely love propagating
especially this type of plant this is
called a satin pothos and I have this
hanging in my bathroom but I just
brought this one out because it's much
tinier and this will eventually grow
tons and tons of roots and then you can
repot it and it will turn into a whole
brand new plant it also have this plant
which I have no idea what it is this was
so inexpensive at my plant nursery I
think it was $3 and I also got this
planter at my local nursery so I will
list all my favorite plant nurseries in
places to get plants down in my
description bar if you live in the los
angeles area and your
curious but and this one is another
little mystery plant I also have this
plant which is Marx's favorite because
it looks so funny and weird I'm also not
sure what this one's called I know I
found the name of it but then I just
forgot it but this one just has long
curly leaves it kind of looks like a
crazy hairdo plant but this one is also
super easy to take care of I just water
it thoroughly once a week and it lives
happily
this plant is like my pride and joy
because I started following a bunch of
plant instagramers if you don't know
there's basically like a whole plant
lover community on Instagram and I
pretty much follow all of them and they
all kept posting this plant and I was
like I have never seen anything like
that and I guess it's like a very rare
house plant because they just aren't
grown very much and they are actually
super expensive if you do find them at a
plant store like I bought this one it
was a little bit tinier when I bought it
and it was like thirty five dollars
which is a lot and they have bigger ones
and they were like seventy dollars like
holy cow but does like I have to get it
because I love it this little baby is
called a paleo pepero pepero pepperoni
pepperoni pepperoni and i can't
pronounce the second part of it I just
caught a Pylea plant and this one is
doing so good and I'm so glad because
I'm just like your Jesus please keep my
pilot alive I paid so much for her is my
monstera plant and this one is like I
would say a teenager the adult monstera
plant
please get about this big which I have
one of them in a jar just a cutting of
one I would say get a more immature one
and then just let it grow bigger and
bigger because these things grow so fast
this one has already grown so much
bigger since I've gotten it and they
will just like take over your entire
house this is my diffenbach II a plant
or also called
Duncan
because these are actually poisonous if
you chew on them which is another point
to point out point out a thing to point
out about some house plants because some
of them can be toxic so I would
definitely do your research before you
buy them in case you have like little
puppies that will eat them or babies
that will eat because diffenbach ia's
are poisonous this one was left here by
the previous owners of our house so it
was really nice because this one is huge
and when they get bigger like this they
do tend to get more expensive and my
last two plants are way too heavy for me
to carry over here so I'm just gonna
talk about them and then I'll insert
little video so you can see what they
look like the first one is my massive
cactus that's sitting right over there
I'm looking at that hack is a trooper I
honestly neglecting I don't really water
him but once every two months and he
just seems perfectly happy he's growing
taller and taller and yeah cactuses are
just super easy to take care of they're
used to desert conditions so um
definitely definitely don't overwater
your cactuses but they are also like the
perfect little house plant because they
just look really adorable and my last
point that I have is my ficus LaMotta
which is in my other living room so I
can't really bring it over because it is
so heavy but another name of for effects
like Radha is a fiddly fig tree we were
so lucky because the people that live
here before us left us that fiddly tree
so I've been doing my best to take care
of it and let it grow and please survive
and it's been doing so good so that is
all of my house plans and I feel like I
went over a lot of care tips with you
guys but one other thing that really
confused me when I started taking care
of plants was knowing when to water them
is take your finger and put it like 2
inches into this
to see if it's still moist and if it's
completely dry that's usually a good
indicator that your plant needs to be
watered so this one feels completely dry
two inches deep so I'll probably water
this one I could talk so much more about
plants like fertilizing propagation like
a million other things but I feel like
this video is already gonna be so long
so if you guys have any other questions
about plants I will answer them in the
comments or even maybe if you want
another plant video I wouldn't be bad to
do that but thank you for watching if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
for new videos every single week and I
will see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
