to do and I thought it would be fun if
you would go through all of my makeup
drawers wasn't none of my help I have
this little basket here that you're
gonna put your choosing thin and you're
gonna choose what makeup I'm gonna wear
today it's up to your discretion if you
want to make me look crazy
if you want to make me look how you
would like me to do my making you have
to work the whole day yeah compared the
whole day it's pretty easy for him
because all of my drawers are kind of
like labeled with what it is freaking
Wow dad she's gonna like self but I can
stamp it when I'm done with her she's
gonna look like a like a crazy blonde
when I'm done with her dad all right
let's do this
I'm gonna do things quick and easy bata
being give me that blush I've got some
tart
it's a Mac I'm gonna blindly go for this
color I don't even know what it looks
like but your boy picked it liquid lips
do we ever let's liquefy these lips like
what find me captain we're gonna pick
this one no idea the next one I don't
give a freaking red whoa
this is eye palace all right I'm gonna
go for the prettiest outside I'm feeling
like this gold is pretty solid so we're
gonna just go with gold see you later
I blushes let's make it blush oh snap
I think she's gonna need this thing I
think she uses this all times it'll
shock that in the bucket I'll give her
an assortment of different ones she's
good big ones small ones tiny one that
should be good you don't really need any
more than that all right this is the
move right here no questions asked this
is my favorite type of lipstick person
bye bye it's like the only thing I
actually have a preference on is the
lipstick eye shadow mascara this is the
thing that we need one of each so we're
gonna grab a little sparkle in the dark
'l there you go good old bucket Kristin
talks about Too Faced better than sex
that's why
do this funky one tart this one kind of
looks random from like the other color
so we're gonna just we're gonna switch
it up a little bit
highlight alright she's gonna be a
little mermaid today that's fine for now
foundation
let's honestly think about this for a
second why do you need all of this NARS
just cause guys um more blush brushes
and we'll give her a big fat one she
might need that and this is powder
Prime's I don't even know what that is
this one I'm gonna dig nevermind it's
too much work okay there's a pore
fessional bronzer bronzer this one's
kind of broken little beat-up so I'm
gonna make your work for this one right
guys no rhyme or reason I just kind of
like the packaging and I'll see how it
looks
Kristen's face this what you wear in a
day girl do you love it thank you well
you a weird foundation today I went
through every single drawer Thank You
Marcus alright okay the first thing I
noticed is that he didn't pick a
foundation okay we'll just have some
water
we'll just make this work okay maybe I
should put my hair up because this is
gonna be a journey so the first person
that I saw actually do this was Tati but
she definitely inspired this video and
also I'm about to declutter all of my
makeup so I thought this would be a good
video to film before it's all nice and
organized so that he had a little bit
more of a challenge okay first I'll just
start with primer get that out of the
way he shows the benefit Porefessional
and I actually love this primer so good
job Marcus and this primer is really
good for filling in your pores it's
really nice for smoothing out any areas
that have texture and I also feel like
it mattifies my skin a little bit so a
plus for primer mark
and the next thing he chose was
concealer this is the NARS concealer in
the shade medium tiramisu but I haven't
really played around with these very
much
maybe I'll just oh no it's a little dark
guys it's a little dark but I'll just
kind of like spot conceal make it work
hmm
I think this is a Beauty Blender that I
have had for so long it actually has
like stains on it I probably should
throw it away after this this final use
this color actually doesn't look too bad
honestly
this isn't looking bad I think I need to
add a little bit more okay so that is
what my skin looks like with my
concealer all over my face he didn't
choose a powder I have an entire powder
drawer
oh no the powder drawer was also the
primer drawer so I guess he got confused
powder from so oh no I guess I'm not
going to be setting my face today
so I'm gonna be so shiny and Creasy that
stinks but he did choose bronzer and
it's funny because this is actually one
of my least favorite bronzers and it's
shattered so one thing I know a ton of
people love this bronzer this is the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer I
think just the smell that makes me a
little like it's like is a little
overpowering so so it's funny then you
chose it's what this has dog hair all
right I'm just gonna try to kind of use
the bronzer to set my whole face because
that's the only option we really have at
this point okay so he chose the Tarte
blush in the shade tipsy I've never
tried this color it
looks really great and pretty though so
I'm excited and I'm just going to use
the same brush because he only gave me
one huge brush so I'm just gonna use a
little bit of that that looks really
bright okay let's see how that looks oh
wow
I actually really like that this looks
like a great summery pink color and then
for highlighter he picked one that I've
never used before
this is benefits dandelion twinkles and
see I've never used this before but see
if you picked a brush
oh he did pick a brush that's kind of
perfect for highlighting honestly don't
need to be any more glowy since we have
no powder whoa oh I think I put way too
much I underestimated the power
oh no if you choose another highlight
guys he chose another what is this this
is a Tarte highlighter stick I'll use a
tiny little bit on my nose okay he gave
me no eyebrows so I guess I'm not gonna
be doing anything to my eyebrows today
but he did give me two things of
eyeshadow I'm just gonna start with this
light pink shade and put that all over
my eyelid Marcus went very minimalist
with his selections like he was like and
I'll just give her like the bare minimum
of what she might need I think I'm gonna
use this color right here it's like
ready oranjee Brown
oh no if I had a big blending brush this
would be so much easier but this tiny
one I've made a huge mistake I've made a
huge massive mistake I'm just gonna use
this little brush that came in the
dandelion highlighter and try to blend
that out because what am I to do
right now that actually blended out this
eye shadow really fast Wow finding a lot
of life hacks in this video and then I'm
gonna take this shade right here with my
finger this is one of my favorite colors
in the palette they're just so chunky
and then I'm gonna put that on my eyelid
he shows the Tarte lifted mascara I've
never tried this so maybe it'll be a new
favorite my final verdict on this
mascara is like you can definitely build
it up but if you like super dramatic
eyelashes this probably is not for you
and the last thing in here is the
lipsticks and he gave me two lipsticks
wow thank you Marcus for some options
this is the Kat Von D liquid lipstick
and it will lead a two which I actually
love this color and Sephora lip stories
lipstick in the shade can lines which I
also love so very good job so here's
what Lolita looks like by itself and
then I'm gonna put this one on top of it
which is a little bit lighter so let's
see I actually like layering liquid
lipsticks underneath cream lipsticks
because it acts as like an ultimate lip
liner because it really keeps this
lipstick on so I actually like the lip
combination and I would say I don't know
let's get Marcus in here to see to see
the final reveal
yeah are you ready yeah very pink I
think I looks good I mean did you like
really do a lot to like accentuate the
now that you barely put it on you just
work with what you did yeah definitely
isn't art picking out maybe I mean it
looks really good on camera I think
yeah worse in real life honestly can I
tell you what the bait 3 biggest mistake
you made it sure covers you didn't give
me anything for my eyebrows did you
notice I don't have any eyebrows your
eyebrows look great babe okay you didn't
give me any face powders on my face so I
give you it see straight series ladies
and gentlemen I've seen my way through
high school okay goodbye okay guys that
is the final makeup look I think I might
just do my eyebrows and set my under
eyes and then I might just wear this for
us today because I don't feel like
picking it all up he didn't like this
video please give a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe I am obsessed with
this shirt wearing I just got it from
urban and I had been wanting this shirt
for so long but it's always been out of
stock and now I'll link it down below

your day and I will see you guys very
