a tour of my Beauty room slash office
slash place where I like to film a lot
of my videos I wanted to start off my
house tour kind of series with this room
because this is kind of the most
personal room for me I got to decorate
it exactly how I wanted to because I'm
the only one really using it but I know
that my biggest video requests lately
has been to do a house tour so I wanted
to kind of split up my house tour into
different sections like I'm gonna start
with this room and then maybe I'll do
like the living room and guest rooms and
then I'll do my room in the kitchen kind
of something like that just so it's not
a huge long video where I can't really
tell you all exactly where everything's
from because in this video I really want
to tell you guys exactly where
everything's from because I know that is
like the biggest thing that you guys
probably wanted man
so this is what the room looks like when
you first walk in through the doors and
this room isn't very big I actually
think they might have used this as a
nursery because it is like the smallest
room in the house but I still really
love it because it's like the perfect
size for an office or a nursery one day
in the future so this is kind of the
makeup storage section I got this
storage dresser from Urban Outfitters
and the reason I chose this one is
because it's the perfect size to kind of
compartmentalize your makeup and also it
has tabs on it where you can write which
thing is in where so I have blush with
lip eye palettes and basically all of
this is filled with an excessive amount
of makeup on top of this little dresser
I have a plant I just painted some white
around this one and it just makes it a
little bit a little bit cuter and then I
have two candles from Anthropologie
right here and then my sister actually
got me this
in Copenhagen so I don't know where you
can find this one and then I just have
that sitting on a little marble platter
that I got from TJ Maxx and then right
above this I have two prints I painted
this print it's just some lemons and
then I also have this print right here
which is from society6 this is a print
of the Oregon coast I just thought it
was super cozy and relaxing looking so I
love this one so much and both of these
frames are from Aaron Brothers and then
in this corner of the room this might be
my favorite corner because it's just I
don't know I made this corner so that I
could it sit right here and film videos
and I just feel like it's just so cute
so I have this clothes rack from Urban
Outfitters and the thing that I like to
use this for the thing that I like to
use this for is to put clothes that I've
just recently gotten and hang them on
here so I can remember to wear them
because a lot of times they just stick
things in my closet and then I forget
about them which is so bad so I like to
just put like new things on here like
the shirt and just some sweaters I like
to kind of keep it seasonal as well so I
have a lot of cute fall things right
here and then I have this be kind sign
which is so adorable this is handmade by
a girl on Etsy I don't remember her
exact name but I will link it down below
for you guys I also like the thought of
putting that behind all of my videos
because then if someone was thinking
about leaving a mean comment and then
they see that sign like maybe
subconsciously they won't leave a mean
comment and then right here I have this
this hat hanging here it's from the
brand lack of color and I think that is
an Australian brand okay I have the kind
of
because this is just a tiny little bench
but I have this bench sitting underneath
the window and I love this bench because
guess where it's from a junkyard Marcus
actually picked this up from a junkyard
and then you brought it home and asked
if I wanted I was like oh yes so I have
this cute little junkyard bench here and
underneath it I have this basket that I
don't have anything and yet this is from
Hobby Lobby right on top of the junkyard
bench I have a hat this hat is from Free
People it's so cute I love this color of
pink so much and then right here I have
a little frame with a picture of me
Marcus in it and that frame is from TJ
Maxx and then I have another plan right
there that plant is so cute I just have
that in a pot that I painted white and
in the other corner of my room I have
this massive gigantic rose gold mirror
this mirror is like it's so humongous
can you even tell how big this mirror is
I don't really know I got this one from
West Elm I actually think it makes this
room feel a lot bigger because right
when you walk in and you just see this
gigantic mirror and it's just like it's
like an optical illusion so this is my
favorite section of my entire room these
flowers this whole thing took me so long
to do by the way but these are all fake
flowers strung around some rope and all
these flowers are from Hobby Lobby Hobby
Lobby has the best the best fake flowers
ever so I love this so much and I feel
like it's super unique I actually got
this idea from a nail salon that I
wouldn't and they had something similar
to this like they had flowers strung on
their walls and I was like I shouldn't
do that in and up in my baby room
because that is something that is so
happy and every time I see it I get so
happy so this is one of my favorite
parts of this whole room okay I think
the best way to show you
this is to just talk to the mirror and
we'll be really like talking to you guys
so this desk is like I said from Urban
Outfitters and so on top of it I just
have a bunch of vanity stuff like things
that you would normally have on your
Mandy so I have this mirror that is from
Urban Outfitters and then I have a mason
jar full of some makeup brushes that I
use on the daily and then I also like to
keep some makeup palettes on my desk
just so I can use them and try them so I
have the Too Faced Just Peachy palette
and I also have the color pop I think I
love you palette and this one is
actually really pretty and I want to do
a little bit because look at that okay I
also have the modern renaissance
palette by Anastasia I have the clover
palette from Too Faced it looks like
this and then I have some good old Naked
palette because I stopped using this for
years and then I pulled it back out and
I forgot how good it was so I have that
one there and the last palette I have up
here is this Charlotte Tilbury palette
this is called G instant eye palette and
I've been testing it this one out and I
really like it and then I just have some
Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks right here
and then some wine sell ones I also have
this beep-beep-beep-beep I also have
this beats pill and I love this for
listening to music on and I just like to
eat it right there it's satisfying that
it fits so perfectly right there and
then over on this side of the desk I
have my perfume this is Jill Malone's
nectarine blossom and honey perfume I
also have this jar with some of these I
have no idea what they're called but I'm
obsessed with these little things
they're so cute and this is just in an
old lemonade bottle
and I also have this hand cream lanolin
hand cream it smells like roses and it's
delicious
I also keep my makeup bag with the
makeup that I use every day on my desk
and then I also have the Jacqueline teal
palette which I just recently got and
I've been using it a ton and I think
it's beautiful and I love it
I totally forgot to mention but this
beautiful chair that I'm obsessed with
is from Urban Outfitters and then on
this side of the room we have two
ginormous cabinets I'll open these
really quick and show you what's in them
in this cabinet basically I have some
extra picture frames I have my hundred
thousand subscriber at YouTube black
which actually just came in the mail
like a week ago so I'm happy to have
this I also have a little jewelry holder
that keeps some of my jewelry I'm
honestly scared to see within this other
side well it's not too messy I wasn't
really planning on showing inside the
cabinets but why not this is all stuff
for a giveaway so all this stuff keeps
piling up and I am just really excited
to finally give this stuff away to you
guys I'm still trying to figure out the
logistics of the giveaway that I want to
do but just know it's a ton of stuff and
then down here I just have some storage
some extra little things some art stuff
which is right there and then some
workout stuff so basically this is the
random things cabinet and then last but
not least in this room it's nice because
it also has a bathroom and it also has a
shower on the other side of the store
which is nice and so I just have some
soap right here this little J which is
from it teaching that and I have some
Polaroids on the mirror of me and Marcus
and camper and then above the toilet I
have a little succulent in this pot
which is from Hobby Lobby love this
succulent so cute and then I have those
towels which are from world market and
then I have this painting which is from
Hobby Lobby and this painting was
actually supposed to be a nursery
painting but I just thought it was
really sweet
so I put that in my bathroom and that is
even a bathroom tour Wow
