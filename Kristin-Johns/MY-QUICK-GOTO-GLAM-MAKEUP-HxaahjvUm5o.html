makeup tutorial because a I haven't done
a makeup tutorial and so long B I went
to the American influencer Awards last
night and I posted a bunch of pictures
on my Instagram and a ton of you guys
asked me about my makeup detail so I was
like I should just show them how I do
kind of like my go-to glam event makeup
that I know will look good in pictures
so this is the exact makeup that I wore
last night to the American influence
Awards if you are curious what I was
wearing so I hope that this video is
helpful and if you want to see how I do
my go-to glam makeup then just keep
watching okay
so for primers today I am gonna be
mixing together two primers because this
one this is the Too Faced hangover RX I
feel like it's more like a moisturizer
and I don't really see a huge difference
with it smoothing out my skin but I
still like to put this on just so that
my skin is super hydrated because it
just makes your foundation go on way
better
and then over top of that I'm going to
be using a benefits professional and the
reason I mix this one in to like my
t-zone area is because this one really
smooths out your skin and for foundation
I always like to use a tried-and-true
foundation because if you're taking
pictures and you know you want your
makeup to look amazing you should just
use something that you know works well
with your skin so I know that the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation looks
great in pictures it never has any weird
like flash back on camera and I'm just
gonna be blending that in with the
japonesque foundation brush the
foundation brush has been my favorite
thing ever lately
I don't know what it is but I just feel
like this thing is magical and if you
ever see this brush like it Ulta or
something pick it up and try it because
it is amazing and I haven't been using
anything else to blend in my foundation
for concealer I'm ashamed because I
always use this concealer but I'm using
the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer I don't know what to do
guys I don't know how to break my habit
of only using this but I actually just
saw that Urban Decay released a new
concealer so maybe I'll try that one and
so we can mix it up a little bit but I
use the shade light neutral and I'm just
gonna blend that in with the same brush
and to set my face I'm using Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I've
actually been trying out a few different
loose powders lately I'm so proud of
myself because I've been using this for
so long but I've tried the Too Faced one
it has like reflective properties in it
and I've been using that daily but I'm
just too scared that it will give flash
back in photography and for contour
today I'm going to be using the Kat Von
D shade and light palette I just got
this at this for of the IB sale and I
love it this color right here is amazing
for contouring at least for my skin tone
but they have so many different shades
in here that I'm sure if none of people
could use and the brush that I've been
using to contour with is the morphe m58
one it's like this little fat brush I
don't know I've never seen a little
brush like this I love it so much for
contouring so I'm just gonna take some
of that middle shade tap tap and
contouring your face makes such a huge
difference especially in photos it just
looks so nice so I always go a little
bit more than usual with my contour if I
know I'm gonna be having pictures taken
and then I'm just gonna give my face a
little bit more warmth using the it
cosmetics sunshine and a compact which
if you just saw me and Marcus's last
video we uploaded on our channel he
bought my makeup and he bought this for
me and I loved it so much it's so pretty
and natural and I also found out that
this is anti-aging which I've never
heard of a powder being anti-aging but I
love that and then to kind of clean up
underneath my contour line I'm going to
take a little sponge this one is from
Tarte and I'm just gonna
that right underneath where I put my
contour just to make sure that it's not
going too low because that's actually
not very good and I feel like I put mine
a little bit too low so I just put it
right underneath it and then I just let
the powder sit there for a little bit
and it kind of just works as like a
magic eraser and it just gives you a
much sharper contour line once you blend
that powder away and for blush last
night I used a little bit of a mixture
of two blushes so I put tipsy by Tarte
on first this one is like a very hot
pink coral color so I just put a little
bit of that on my cheeks and then on top
of that I put my all-time favorite blush
and this is tarts captivating I'm used
this every day and for highlight I use
oh this got broken oh my gosh I didn't
know that this was broken this wasn't
broken last night so I guess it just
happened but I'm using Becca's opal
highlighter the one bad thing about
Becca's highlighters is that they break
so easily what the heck I didn't even
bring this with me last night how did
this get shattered now I'm gonna blend
away this and see how it gives such a
nice line it just looks very nice okay I
got a little bit closer so you could
really see but now oh oh it's almost
fell I got really scared I'm gonna be
using the Anastacio brow powder I use
this every day and I've actually been
doing my eyebrows before my eye makeup
lately just because I feel like it helps
me see better where I need to blend my
eye shadow out because it really frames
your face and for my eye shadow last
night I really mostly used the jaclyn
hill morphe palette because it just has
so many options in it and i also mixed
in some shades from the tartlet in bloom
palette so i'm actually going to take
this palette first because I really love
this cream shade right here and I'm
gonna put that all over my lid okay now
I'm gonna go in with the Jaclyn hill
palette and I'm going to be
using the shade right here it's just a
nice warm brown color and I'm really
gonna be blending out my crease a lot
you'll see I'm gonna be adding a lot of
different colors because that's really
what gives you such a pretty like faded
nice eye makeup look so I'm gonna first
start out by doing that one in the
crease now I'm going to go in with this
shade right here which is kind of like a
mustard yellow brown color and I'm just
going to take that with the same brush
and just put that right on top of the
shade that I just put on there and this
is just gonna add even more warmth even
more depth really all I want in and I
look is warmth and depth now I'm gonna
take a little bit of a smaller brush and
I'm gonna dip into this shade right here
this shade is more of a ready darker
Brown and I'm just gonna put that on the
very outer corner of my eye then I'm
gonna go in with the shade right here
it's kind of like a rose gold bronzy
color it looks like this and I'm just
gonna put that all over my lid and this
is just gonna be really pretty and kind
of brighten everything up but still stay
a little bit smoky and now I'm going to
go back into the Tarte palette and I'm
going to take this shade right here and
this is the color leader and this is
kind of just like a deep ready brown
color and I'm just gonna put that right
on the outer part of my eye and then
once you place that down and just take a
blending brush and blend it all together
so once that's blended out you should
have something like this and then I'm
gonna add the shade funny girl which is
in the Tarte palette to my inner corner
just to make everything bright calling
me now I'm just gonna be putting on some
liquid eyeliner I'm gonna be doing a cat
eye but just like very thin or at least
I'm gonna try to keep it really thin
okay I just put on a little bit of
mascara and now I'm gonna put on some
fake eyelashes I'm so mad at myself
because I threw away the box that these
came in and now I can't remember which
style they are but they are from velour
lashes and they look like this they're
not very
they're actually super super pretty and
I'm really mad at myself now that I
can't remember the name but I'm sure
I'll be able to find them and link them
down below so I'll try and be that for
you guys okay and the last thing for the
eyes is I'm just going to take some of
this red color right here and just put
that right underneath and I'm also going
to take some of this brown shade as well
right on top of that and then I just put
some mascara on my lower lash line and
so the eyes are completely done now we
just have to do our lips and then we're
completely finished wow I just started
putting on my lipstick before I even
told you guys what I was using but I'm
using tarts lip paint in delish and I
love using liquid lipsticks because they
just last longest and you just don't
have to really worry about them which I
love and then on top of that last night
I put the kkw liquid cream lipstick and
I use the shade Kimmy and these just
look really really pretty over liquid
lipsticks okay guys this is exactly how
I did my makeup for the American
influencer Awards last night and this is
pretty much how I do my makeup for any
event that I go to just because I know
that it will look good on camera and I
also know that it will look good in real
life so that is how I pretty much always
do my makeup it's like my go-to glam
makeup look and it usually only takes me
like 30 minutes so it's not too hard at
all so I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video and if you did please
give it a thumbs up and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
