going to be showing you what I use for
my skin so my skincare routine and I
have really been needing to film an
updated one of these because I did one
of these uh probably over a year ago in
all of the products that I use have
changed since then so I needed to do a
little update and I'm going to share
with you guys what I used to keep my
skin happy healthy clear moisturized all
that good stuff so let's just get
started
so the first thing that I have to
mention to you guys because this has
seriously changed my skin is this this
is the vanity planet ultimate skin spa I
mentioned this in a video a while back
and I've been using it ever since then
so I probably been using this for over
eight months comes with three different
brush options for you and I'll show you
the first one this is the one that I've
used most the time and this is just like
everyday cleansing brush it has longer
bristles and it's a little bit softer so
it's not super exfoliating but it will
get all the makeup and stuff off your
skin and it also comes with this one
which is the more exfoliating brush it
has shorter bristles it's a little bit
firmer and this one's really good for
exfoliating and getting off any dead
skin or dry skin off your face and then
it also comes with a silicone head brush
and this one's really good if you have
acne prone skin because this one it
resists bacterial build-up and the
reason that I love this brush system is
because I've really been able to tell a
huge difference with my skin I used to
get little bumps on my forehead from
just like clogged pores I've never had
really bad problems with acne or
anything like that but I used to get
little dots on my forehead or little
breakouts on my cheeks once in a while
but I never really get breakouts anymore
ever since I've been using this because
I just feel like it cleanses my skin so
well every single day that there's not
really room for bacteria to like get in
my face so if you guys are looking for
something for your skincare
that will help blend your skin exfoliate
it help prevent breakouts I would
definitely recommend the Skin Spa it's
usually a hundred and thirty dollars but
I have a coupon code it will be in the
link in my description box and you can
get 70% off so it will only be $39 so I
definitely think that that is a huge
deal especially for something that I use
every single day
religiously that has a hundred percent
change my skin okay the next thing that
I want to talk about is my face cleanser
this is the pure skin face cleanser by
first aid BD I've been using this for a
while now probably five months now and I
think it's just a really nice gentle
it's a gentle face cleanser like it's
nothing crazy it's pretty basic but
that's what I like in skin care I don't
like things that are too like too many
ingredients too wild claims like I just
like things that are pretty basic I
think so if you're looking for just a
really good daily cleanser I would
definitely recommend this one I use it
anything with it to go along with the
whole cleansing theme I also want to
give you guys a little tip I just want
to say cleansing is 100% in my opinion
the most key factor to having a clear
clean healthy skin because if you sleep
with your makeup on or you sleep with
the days of dirt and gross miss on your
face you're bound to have breakouts so
my biggest tip in this whole video would
be to wash your face every single night
but I know even for me that's not
reality because sometimes I'm so tired
the last thing I want to do is wash my
face I always like to keep some face
cleansing wipes in my bedside table
because I know that sometimes I'm just
not going to make it to the sink that
night because I'm too tired so I've been
using these these are the birth fees
since they get sent a little sensitive
facial cleansing towelettes and I like
these because they're just gentle they
don't smell crazy and these remove
makeup and oil and dirt and you don't
have to rinse your face after which I
really like I also have these that I got
as a gift and these are the philosophy
purity made simple facial cleansing
wipes
try these yet but they look really nice
but I just wanted to tell you guys
that's a good tip to keep some makeup
wipes on in your bedside table so that
if you don't want to cleanse their face
at night even though you should you can
have these on hand and then for face
moisturizer I have two this is the one
that I was using for super long and I
actually ran out of that I don't have
any more left this is an empty jar but I
saved it for this video this is the
first a beauty ultra Repair Hydra firm
sleeping cream so I would use this at
nighttime and sometimes in the daytime
and really break the rule and really
notice that this made my skin feel very
hydrated this one was like it was like
moisture was just surging into my skin I
was thinking about repurchasing it but I
went ahead and got this when I ran out
because I wanted to try something
different and so this is the moisturizer
that I'm using now this is the Kate
Somerville goat-milk moisturizing cream
and again this is a very basic
moisturizer it doesn't have any crazy
claims it's for sensitive skin and you
can use this in the morning and at
nighttime so that's what I do and I've
actually put this on before I do my
makeup and I use it at nighttime after I
cleanse my face and this is very
interesting because let me just show you
to get the product out you actually
squeeze the top and then product comes
out which i think is very interesting
packaging if you like it's really um
sanitary because you're not having to
dip your hands in the product so I
really like that and I've been using
this for about a month now I love it it
hasn't broken me out at all
but another thing that I really like
well using it is this and this is the
Mario Badescu silver powder and I
actually bought this for Marcus for his
birthday as one of his presence because
Marcus has very troublesome skin has
very many problems with his skin because
he is super oily skin so he gets clogged
pores really easily so I bought on this
because I've read that it's really good
but I've been using this too so
like a present for me as well and like I
said this is called a silver powder and
it looks kind of crazy it looks just
like white talc powder and kindness but
what you do is you wet a cotton pad and
dip it in there and put it on your skin
if you're having breakouts oh dropped it
if you're having breakouts or little
trouble areas or you want to absorb more
oil and a specific spot of your skin and
when you take it off it just makes your
skin feel really clean I've been able to
tell that when I use that and put it
like on a little bit overnight that the
next morning it's pretty much gone so
that is one thing that I really like
using when I do have a breakout so that
is it for my skincare routine that is
literally every single thing that I do
for my skin so hopefully that helps some
of you guys if it did help you please
