simple and fast video I'm going to show
you guys how I do my messy bun a lot of
you guys commented on my last interior
that I posted and wanted to see how I
did my bun so I figured I'd get on here
and film it for you guys it's so fast
it's so easy and I feel kind of weird
making a video about it just because
it's really easy and you guys probably
be like oh the figure that I would film
for you guys since you wanted to see it
so if you want to see how I do this bun
then just keep watching first thing I do
when I want to do a messy bun is just
get all my hair back like I'm going to
put it in a ponytail so I usually just
start by flipping it over and then I
have something that looks like this just
like put it up like you're going to do a
high ponytail make sure you have all the
little flyaway pieces cuz I always
forget those pieces maximum and then
what you're gonna do is just twist your
hair so have a whole lot of hair if you
can see I just start at the bottom and
then just twist it and I always twist it
to the right that's kind of music I
twist it to the right usually you have
all your hair twisted up and it kind of
looks like a play-doh snake or something
you just kind of keep twisting it but
put your hair down like at the top of
your head and then just start twisting
it around itself and then you have your
little bun so just secure that with your
ponytail holder
I usually just wrap it around twice then
you have something that looks like a
little
Fona on your head and then at this point
let's pull out these little hairs that I
have the same of know-how get rid of
these hairs why so small why so small
that's pretty much how I get just my
messy bun and you can see that there is
hairs popping out everywhere and in the
back there's probably lots of bumps and
weirdness happening but if you want it
to make it neater you could use some you
could use some bobby pins and see you
have a big bump right here so you could
just use vibin and bobby pin that thing
back you didn't want any big old bumps I
always have this bump back my head I
think I might be like a cowlick or
something but I always have it but I
never really pin that back because you
can also take one of these it's like a
little wire headband and I got this from
recycled this room I got this from
American Apparel I think so I would just
put it like this in my hair
and then just twist it around itself and
then just twist it and then it's a
little accessory for your hair so it's
not such a boring messy bun you can make
it a little bit more spicy so that is
how I do my messy bun I hope that you
liked this video and I hope that it was
helpful if you guys want to see any
other hairstyle videos just leave them
in the comments below oh yeah and I'm
really excited to let you guys know that
now I am going to be posting a video

exciting and so if you guys have any
video recommendations please put them

great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
