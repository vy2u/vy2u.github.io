some of my favorite things from the
month of April and I can't say I'm too
sad that April is over because that
means that school is almost over
and that means I'm very happy but I
still found a lot of favorite things
from April and I can't wait to show them
to you guys because I think you're gonna
like them so I hope you guys had a good
April and let's just get started ok so
my first thing I want to show you guys
is kind of like a new hobby that I
picked up and that's kind of random but
I think you guys will like it and if you
follow me on snapchat you know exactly
what I'm talking about because I maybe
snap about this a little bit too much
but it's planting things and this month
has been like the month of plants for me
I bought two different kinds of herbs
two different kinds of flowers which are
these sunflowers and these cosmos which
are little pink flowers and I just have
been a plant theme this month and I've
really been loving planting them and
taking care of them
sad story my two herbs actually died and
I don't know how because I was taking
very good care of them but one day I
just woke up and they were all dead and
it had like mold growing on the top of
it which how does that even happen
so my two herbs are dead but I still got
these two flowers and I just can't wait
till they're flowers because I just know
I will be such a proud plant mom once
they're actually bloomed because I'll be
like I didn't kill them and I actually
got those two little pots from Target
and they're only like three dollars and
they come with like the seeds and the
soil so if you guys are looking to plant
some things and I would definitely check
out Target another thing that I've been
loving this month is kind of along the
same lines as planting because it's
another hobby and that is calligraphy
and I started doing calligraphy about
like a little over a week ago I think
like a little over a week or two weeks
ago and I've just been practicing every
single day and I love it so much if any
of you guys want to start doing
calligraphy please do it because it's so
much fun it's really relaxing
I made this for one of you guys I made a
giveaway on Twitter and I just picked
the winner randomly and I let them pick
whatever verse or quote that they wanted
me to paint for them and I did it and so
this is what it looks like and I'm gonna
be doing these every single Monday after
my videos so if you guys want to enter a
calligraphy slash watercolor giveaway
then make sure you guys follow me on
Twitter and Instagram because I'll be
doing them on both of those you guys
want to see like a beginner's tutorial
for calligraphy or like what I got as my
starter set then I would definitely do
that for you some of you have requested
that on my Twitter so just let me know
just like this video or comment down
below and I will definitely do that for
you the next thing I have been loving
this month is this and it's this special
little package and it's by anastasiya
and it's called the glow kit and gleam
and this is what it looks like and this
is special because one of my friends
sent this to me as a surprise because me
and her really share the same love for
makeup so she sent this to me knowing
that I would love it and it is amazing
these highlighters I've never felt such
soft highlighters and they're so
pigmented this is perfect for the summer
time because they just make your skin
look so healthy and glowy so I just know
I'm gonna be using this like crazy this
summer the next makeup II thing that I
have to share with you guys is this
blush and it's from Tarte and it's
called tipsy I love the names of these
because they're so cute but this one is
just like a bright orange pink shade and
it looks kind of scary in the pan I was
like really scared to put it on my face
because I didn't want to look like a
crazy person
but I'm actually wearing it today and
you can tell that it's not too
over-the-top or crazy and it just really
brightens your face up a lot and I just
love it it's so cute it's so compact
perfect for traveling
and it has definitely been a favorite
this month I think that I want to
mention is something that I wanted to
mention to you guys a ton of it is back
but I kept forgetting and if this
lipstick by Burt's Bees and it's in the
shade suede splash and this is what it
looks like it's just a really pretty
neutral color my favorite kind of color
actually found this one when I was on
the Canada road trip with Marcus and my
lips were so dry and all my lipsticks
were just drying them out even more so
we went into Walgreens and I found that
and I just thought Burt's Bees is
probably a more moisturizing lipstick
because they make really good chap
sticks and this lipstick is super
moisturizing it's so comfortable to wear
and it's from the drugstore so it's
really affordable they're in the
helicopter what does that helicopter
doing they're looking for someone the
next thing I have to share with you guys
is a candle and this candle is from
Target it's by the brand herb and Irma
garden essence and this is just first of
all the cutest little candle I've ever
seen and this one is the lemon and olive
leaf scent and it's just super fresh
smelling it's perfect if you would put
this in your kitchen it would just be
perfect but I light it in my room
because I want my room to smell fresh
just love how cute the little packages
it looks so cute as decoration in your
room and I've never really had candles
from Target I usually get them from like
TJ Maxx or Marshalls or something but I
absolutely love that candle and I also
have this one and it's from the same
brand it's just a little bit smaller and
if you saw my room tour then I showed
you guys this but this is by the same
brand and it's the lavender and sage one
this kit actually knocked this one down
off my counter when the lid was closed
but the candle wax was still all wet and
now it's all messed up so thank you very
much biscuit but this one is actually
really good too and they have all
different sizes they have this size this
size and I think one more that's a
little bit bigger but all of them are so
cute and I smelt them all and they all
smell really good my last favorite is
actually some
that's very random and I can't bring it
in here because it's kind of huge and
bulky but it is my food processor and I
ordered a food processor about two weeks
ago and it came in and I have been using
it every single day it is life-changing
it's so good and I'm actually gonna do
like a two part fitness and health
routine so I'm gonna do like a what I
eat in a day video and my food processor
will definitely be in that video and
I'll show you some of my favorite things
that I make with it and it just makes my
heart so happy because I have always
wanted a food processor and then finally
got one so I will show you guys how I
use it in my next video but I just love
it and that has been definitely one of
my favorite things from this month okay
guys that is the end of this video I
hope that you liked it if you do like
favorites videos please give this video
