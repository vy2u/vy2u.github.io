boyfriend and we're going to be filming
my boyfriend does my makeup alright
alright so let them know what the rules
are the rules are I can't help him and
like tell him exactly what to do and I
can't look in the mirror and fill in I
think that's like I'm not gonna go
cheesy with this like I'm not sure I put
like freaking like give you clown cheeks
I'm gonna try to make you look good oh
right
all right so I got any makeup on right
now and he's gonna transform naked skin
weightless concealer I know what
concealer is someone said you um wanna
get rid of some redness under here
forgot it I think I got my deal all
right well you're not getting balls on
this mini cover all right look look look
you have okay all right you know what I
take it back it's harder it's it's
freakin hard and I thought but I'm gonna
brush it all in
next please yes I don't know why there's
any reason to have this many brushes
like you can just have a big medium
small don't tell me anything Kristen
you're breaking your own rules
I don't want precision with this but I'm
I'm gonna use this whatever already this
is definitely not the right brush no um
helical actually you just have a MOLLE I
will say this one stuff your skin but
better right I think not honestly like I
want to go something kind of natural
because she honestly looks so beautiful
without makeup but it's good to get rid
of my block looking I don't know look
all right I shouldn't maybe put it on my
hand but this is a mistake
taking it off right now can like glob it
and then take it off
you know getting in your hair babe okay
I'm just gonna do do it like a lot all
right we use this brush and I'll just
I'm gonna get I'm gonna wipe it in and
look it may not be correct but once
again I'm a nice little slippery do some
Mac Studio Fix don't know what this is
powder yes of course I already use this
I think I'm going to use this I'm pretty
sure this is a powder brush so I'm gonna
doodle it on here too much time I'm just
gonna doodle it oh god that was much
stain I didn't know that it was gonna be
so much I should have put that much on
you know I gotta get I gotta get it all
around on you I have so many freaking
brushes like why not it's a little
darker I'm just going oh shoot hi Kris
there's so much on your last time it
made you look like sketchy one look
locally stop Oh God
hot dang and I know it's screwed on them
look on this side vid oh I think this is
contour like make your jaws pop like a
mole liquor yeah bones like more cheeky
I'm pretty sure yeah I'm going to do a
tiny bit more just because why not let's
get let's get freaky up in here solo to
do a little contour on the door
it's fun where I've heard of that before
Brown Wiz brow is looks like what is
brown Wiz that sounds disgusting
alright brow is for eyebrows you don't
need this stuff if you have good
eyebrows they're like literally on fleek
24/7 I'm gonna do it anyways oh sorry
Chris but I can't be like make it up
makeups hard like I just don't know how
it works like I'm looking at this and
I'm like okay yeah this goes here right
and then you put a little round of it
and it's all screwed up like come on
good good for a clean roll very clean
roll yeah oh my god
eyebrows on literal fleek like I don't
want to hurt your eyes so be so careful
can you look up eyeliner
oh gosh this goes on the top oh hey
listen it if this looks bad it's her
fault for sure look over here hey how do
you do this yourself wow your eye
did you mess up I think Kristen I think
you're supposed to maybe put that on the
bottom alright so that's what I did so
far it looks like crap I know
don't judge me on to the eyeshadow use
this brush I feel like it's just solid
brush you know and I'm gonna put some of
this on and I'm gonna go I'm gonna go
dark oh I'm gonna go gold because she
uses this a lot obviously so I'm going
to use this one and then I'm going to go
above her eye and
make you kind of blend in with the I
don't know if that was the ticket or not
I think it looks decent yeah I think it
looks pretty good I don't know maybe not
I'm screwing things up in no I think
you're doing great okay all right so
next we're gonna do you look so weird
your eyes it's cryptic but step advice
for eyes what can I say oh don't have to
put a lot like the stuff that's like
that goes on your actual eyeball and
it's a pen I know it's a pen when I've
seen it it's a pen but I don't see how
it goes on inside rim I can tell you
dang it I think it goes on the inside
rim but I won't hurt you it looks kind
of it do being wet there so I don't
think I should go there I like your
eyeball looks what there but whatever
here we go I feel like this is such a
guy with come here so like driving here
fenice scrapes hard like I don't know
how girls do this junk I better have a
new appreciation blush this is gotta be
blush I know this blush don't wanna do
some more options we'll go with this
Coral
ooh I show above the brush that you're
using
I'm gonna do some of that okay great
do some of that a little more when I get
this car tittle it in I toodle it in
look at me while I total it in that
looks so good this is so nerve-racking I
feel like I'm like defusing a bomb right
now what the heck you this feel so
so clipping disgustoid alright alright
ready look up this is definitely gotta
go here I think I'm gonna paint them
down on them no just kidding just done
but in say with the black crap on your
eyelashes now it makes everything kind
of come together so do it that's what
mascara tends to dip Oh fake eyelashes
freaking I have to put these on and
that's we're using these but I thought
it'd be funny for him to do these ok
fine I'll do oh it's goopy alright I
don't know if that's protocol or not but
actually put kind of too much on I feel
like I crushed that I'm just gonna go
ahead and say I feel like I crushed that
blended with the napkin lashes no oh
wait no this looks so that okay uh I'm
kind of okay with that we'll see some
lipstick Oh some options I thought the
red would be the artist so the funnies
you should try the red and make it a
little bit harder face but it won't look
good with the skin tones and everything
that I did and the sparkles are gonna do
rim hello artiste Marcus yeah I don't
want to go too much on the essays I'm
like a girl's got to eat to feel me I'm
saying that looks pretty decent I'm
excited to see what it really look like
but I'm not here to show myself so this
is Kristen I mean look I obviously
messed up the eyes I'm gonna be real
like the wings I didn't get in the
eyelashes to me aren't my favorite
butter than that I feel like the contour
like I kind of I kind of
could have done better maybe a little
wait you and then I put some on your
chin randomly but then other than that
not the moment truth tell me how I did
are you nervous yeah what what's so good
what's ahead
oh my do you drew that eyeliner going
downward
what do you mean like it's going down oh
this doesn't go up yeah whoa okay all
right yeah that's not such a bad mistake
the eyebrows are on fleek
obviously on fleek I give you a c-minus
comment down below what you think about
this makeup did Marcus do a good job or
did he was he slightly off I was
slightly looking I think I was slightly
off but for the first time like I think
