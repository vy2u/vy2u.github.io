today's video because fall is probably
my favorite time of the whole year so
obviously I wanted to do a fall inspired
and makeup look for you guys I wanted to
do a really warm smoky ish eye not too
smoky but kind of smoky and a really
pretty matte lip so if you want to see
how I did this makeup look then just
keep watching
okay guys I'm so excited about this
makeup because I'm feeling so full right
now I have this little dress on and this
type of little ruffles around the
sleeves and the neck it's just like my
best thing I love this dress so much
it's from urban I'll link it down below
if you're interested but I just think
it's so cute and it's really getting me
in the fall mood so I'm really excited
about this makeup tutorial and the first
thing I used today is this primer it's
by Mac and it's called strobe cream and
I think it feels really nice on my skin
I've actually never used that primer
before and then for my foundation today
I'm going to be mixing these two colors
of the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I know I use this foundation
too much but it really is my favorite
and I just think nothing can beat it so
I'm really trying to find a new
foundation but I haven't found one that
completely replaces that one yet but for
brushes today I am gonna be mentioning
something new and I'm so excited to
share this with you guys because I just
think it's an awesome product and these
brushes are by vanity planet and they
come in a little set of this you open it
up and then you have all of these
brushes pretty much every single brush
you would ever need comes in this set
and these brushes are such nice quality
and they're vegan and cruelty free which
i think is so important I've been trying
to be more conscious of just buying
makeup that is cruelty free because I
love animals and I need to be better at
just buying cruelty-free makeup because
I think that that's so important and
this brush sets price is usually $100
but vanity planet was so nice
giving you all a coupon code and you can
get 70% off so this whole set is just
going to be $30 which i think is just a
huge deal and I think this would be a
great Christmas present for maybe one of
your friends or family members that's
starting out on makeup and needs a bunch
of brushes or if you just want to add
some really good brushes to your set I
think that this would be a great thing
to buy love the handles of them I'm like
a sucker for wood so I love this
packaging and I just love them so much
and to start off I'm going to be using
this little buffer brush so I'm going to
be putting a little bit of the shade
nude on my brush and then a little bit
of the shade warm beige on my brush and
then I just thought it all over my face
it kind of just mixes itself together
and then I'm just going to be buffing
that in I actually just got back in town
I was in Orlando for the weekend because
I had to go home to look at different
wedding venues and I went home hoping
that I would find a wedding dress and I
did find a wedding dress and I found a
venue and I found a date all this
weekend so I got so much done this
weekend and I'm so happy because I just
felt like those were the three things
that I really needed to get done because
time is really running out really fast I
can't believe I graduate in December
that's so crazy so I'm so excited but I
traveled home with these brushes and it
was just so nice to have all your
brushes in one little set and they never
got messed up because they're in a
perfect little case so I think that
these are really good brushes for
traveling too and then for concealer
today I'm also using a product that I
haven't showed you guys on camera yet
but I've been using it in ton and it's
the Tarte shaped tape concealer and this
thing has been so hyped on YouTube so I
went to Ulta to see if they had it they
didn't so how to order it online but
I've really been liking it it is super
full coverage I have the shade light
neutral and so I just put
tiniest tiniest bit around my nose and
around my eyes and it really is simple
coverage it really Wow it covers a walk
and I'm just going to be taking up my
Beauty Blender and blending that all out
but anyways I'm so excited that I found
my wedding dress
umm it's so perfect it's everything that
I ever ever dreamed of in a wedding
dress
and I was getting so nervous because I
was like I don't know if I'm gonna find
a wedding dress because I have such a
specific idea in mind of what I wanted
and I walked right into the store and I
showed the lady some pictures of the one
that I wanted and she was like oh we
have that exact dress that you want and
I tried it on and I knew right away that
it was my perfect dress so I keep
wanting to post pictures of my wedding
dress show you guys but I know I can't
do that because then Marcus wouldn't see
and that would be a big task Rafi and
then for powder today I'm going to be
using this one by Paul and Joe I did a
review on this whole brand in my last
video so I'll link that below if you
would like to see that but I'm not going
to be using the puff today because I
want a little bit more precision so I'm
going to be using this little brush and
dipping in to the powder to set my under
eyes and this brush fits underneath your
eyes so well that has a little tip on it
and then to set the rest of my face I'm
going to take this big kabuki brush that
comes in it and I'm going to dip that in
there and tap off excess and put that
all over the rest of my face and these
brushes feel so soft they probably are
some of the softest brushes I've ever
felt I saw this other brush that I have
is this huge it cosmetics one and they
feel the exact same and this brush is
like $60 or so in insane so you're
getting such a good deal with all these
brushes just love them so for bronzer
today I'm going to switch it up from my
usual hoola bronzer and I'm
use this hourglass one this is called
the ambient lighting bronzer radiant
bronze light and it's just this
beautiful little bronzer and I'm going
to be taking it on this size brush from
the little set and putting that all over
my face
I think bronze would really help out
every makeup look because I don't know
why maybe I have to light a foundation
but on camera sometimes before I put on
my bronzer I look like a big ghost so I
just think every time I add bronze are
in a video it really helps out makes me
look a little bit more alive I'm going
to be using probably my favorite fall
time blush and its benefits rocket or
it's such a pretty mommy pretty shimmery
blush I love it so much I'm going to be
taking it on the same brush that I use
for bronzer and just put that on my
cheeks there's something really special
about this blush and I feel like people
on YouTube used to talk about it all the
time I feel like no one really talks
about it anymore because they forgot
about it but it's still such a good
blush and I use it all the time
especially in the fall because it's just
such a perfect color and then for my
highlighter today I'm going to be using
my favorite highlighter probably of all
time this is Becca's champagne pop it's
by my girl Jacqueline Hill and I'm going
to be using it on a highlighter brush
that comes in this kit um but I love
this highlighter so much I always think
oh this is really silly but I always
think of just like DMing Jacqueline
ending like can you do my makeup for my
wedding because that would be my dream
but I know she's way too busy to do my
wedding makeup but I just think that
that would be so amazing or even just to
be her friend because she just seems so
nice down to earth we both live in
Florida it could happen and for the
eyebrows today I'm going to be using
this little angled brush that comes in
the kit as well I actually just went
home and got my eyebrows waxed so
they're not looking way too wild so
that's good okay so I'm going to start
out by using the NARS smudge proof eye
no base I love this one so much one of
you guys snapchatted me and said what is
your all-time favorite favorite
eyeshadow primer so that my eyeshadow
won't move at all throughout the day and
I was just immediately new NARS smudge
proof because it really is the only
primer I've ever ever used that keeps my
eyeshadow looking OnPoint all day and
also I just realized this you guys can
see this cut on my lip that's from me
and my best friend um playing cards last
night and I tackled her because she won
so then she accidentally elbowed me in
the lips so that's what's on my lip
right now so I'm just going to take this
big um flat brush it's really good for
packing on just color on your lid and
I'm going to be taking this Kylie shadow
in the shade Jasper and I'm just going
to put that all over my lids as a base
for the rest of our I shadow and I've
actually been using this palette so much
I did a review on this on my channel a
few weeks over like a month ago and I
really have been using this palette ever
since so I'm going to start with the
shade creme brulee by makeup geek and
I'm just going to use this blender brush
and I'm just going to put that in my
crease and even if you are doing a dark
eye just by doing a transition shade in
the beginning it really helps everything
look super blended out so that you don't
have any like weird lines in the end and
it just helps the whole eyeshadow
process be a lot easier I'm going to
take the shade Coco bear by makeup geek
and this is just a really pretty matte
eyeshadow shade and I'm going to put a
little bit of that on the brush and just
put that all over my lid every single
time I do eyeshadow like this when I'm
just getting ready for the day I always
get at this point I'm like oh my gosh
this looks so bad but just trust me it
gets better really soon I'm taking a
little bit of grandstand on this little
flat brush that also comes from the kit
sprayed it with a little bit of fix+
just like that to make it a little bit
more metallic and I'm just
take that on the center of my eyelid and
now I'm going to take the shade tiger i
and the Kylee palette and I'm just going
to run that through my crease so I can
just blend everything out and then I'm
just going to take Tiger eye on a little
brush that also comes in the kit it
comes with a lot of brushes so I'm just
going to take this one and run it right
underneath my lash line and then last
thing for my eyes I'm just going to take
a little bit of the shade starry-eyed
from makeup geek on this little smudger
brush and I'm going to put that on my
inner corners I'm not going to be using
any mascara on my eyelashes because I do
still have eyelash extensions even
though they're looking pretty because I
haven't gotten them refilled in a while
but I am going to be putting mascara on
my lower lashes so for lips I think I'm
going to go a little bit bold and do
route from colour-pop or root root yeah
it's route huhu I think it's too dark
skin I don't like it I don't like it so
I'm actually going to do a combination
that I've been wearing a lot lately and
I think you guys will like it it's world
by Mac on top of Kylie cosmetics Kandy K
so let me try that and see if I like
that a little bit better over top I'm
going to use Kylie cosmetics candy kay I
always get confused Coco candy K so many
cakes but I really really like this
color it's a little bit lighter than the
lip liner but I like it I think it's a
good combo okay guys that is the final
fall inspired makeup look I am so happy
that fall is here I really hope that you

that it is an amazing deal to get all of
these brushes for only $30 so again I'll
