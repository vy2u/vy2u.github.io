favorites video and I figure it all this
is a good month to start doing my
monthly favorites because August is a
month where kind of a lot of stuff
happens because it's the end of summer
you start school again
Marx's face haunting me I'm filming a
video okay where was I oh yeah I think
that August is a good month to start
doing monthly favorites because a whole
lot of stuff happens in August summer
ends school starts so while stuff so I'm
back in Tallahassee for school and so
I'm back with all my friends and I'm
back in my old room and this kid is here
he's actually lying on my bed right
there but he'll say hello in this video
I just don't want to wake him up right
now okay so my first favorite of the
month is this blush and this to me is
the perfect peach blush it's like do you
want a better peach blush cuz I don't
think that you can get it this is
perfect and it just makes your cheeks
look happy and perky and with a little
tan it has that orange mist in it not
borned but like sunkissed look to it and
I just really thought that my next
favorite is an eyeliner and it's the
eyeliner that I've been using for about
the last two years but I've never said
it in a favorites video cuz I've never
done a favorites video so now I'm
mentioning it and it's the Physicians
Formula
I'm mister and I give it an ultra black
new up cat eye so easily and it doesn't
drag it doesn't make you have like a
bumpy line it's really smooth and it
stays on me all day and it's also great
because it's cheap it's from the
drugstore and who doesn't love the
drugstore so this is the
only been always favorite a lifetime
favorite but I figured that I mention it
it last thing makeup related is this
this Korres lip butter and quince this
is just first of all I love this package
because it's so tiny and you can just
throw it in your purse and it won't get
all gross
I hate when lip products get hairs in
them because it's in your purse and
you're like I don't really want to put
that here right now so I love this
because it's a screw top and then it has
this cute little color inside of it and
it smells amazing I love this because
it's really hydrating so it kind of
protects your lips during the summer and
it feels so nice going on so this has
definitely this is definitely this has
definitely been pointed out this has
definitely been a favorite this month
the next thing I'm going to show you
isn't makeup but it's kind of a body
product it is this lotion by the body
shop and it is called vineyard peach and
that is what it is this is a vineyard of
peaches in a bottle and I really love
this lotion because it's super hydrating
and after you come home from the beach
it's so nice to just really moisturize
your skin because the Sun kind of dries
it out sometimes so I always use this
and it's really really good quality and
it makes you smell like peaches or
whatever flavor person that you get for
the whole day so this is great my next
favorite I didn't know if I was going to
share this with you guys or not but
really I was like what has really
than my favorite things of month and
these really have been my favorite
things a month and I got new tennis
shoes
what tennis shoes are your favorites
okay tennis shoes are my favorite
because I have not gotten new tennis
shoes in about two years so I was very
very much needed new tennis shoes and I
got these they are Nike roches rosh rosh
are alina but I saw them to the store
and I thought those are pretty cute and
then I looked at the price and they're
not insanely expensive they're just nice
casual tennis shoes that you can just
wear with anything
you know what I'm saying my neck
favorite is actually something that I've
been doing this month that I really
enjoyed and okay so it's kind of
chipping so I got this little journal I
don't know if you can see it or if it's
kind of like blown out but I got this
journal and it says sweet nothings on it
and that is just really cute but the
reason that I have been loving this
journal is because every single night
before I go to sleep I've been writing
down three happy things about the day
and so it forces me to look back at my
day and just think what are some things
that made you smile today and then I
write them down and it kind of makes me
feel happy and positive before I go to
sleep and I think that this is a really
cool thing for anybody to do just write
down really quick before you go to sleep
three positive things about your day and
then just call it a night go to bed and
then do that every night for awhile and
it's just kind of makes you feel more
positive just in life if it makes you
look for the little things and find joy
in the little things so that was
definitely a favorite of this month so
another favorite
kind of like along same lines but this
is my devotional it's called the
one-year walk with God devotional by
Chris Tiger my gosh guys
this is the best devotional ever okay
I'll show you what it's like go to the
day and then it shows you a first for
the day and then it kind of explains to
you what the verse means how it applies
to you all that kind of stuff
so for example today's would be in his
heart a man plans his course but the
Lord is steps proverbs 16:9 and then it
will go on to say more about that verse
I just really love this devotion cuz
it's easy to read but also it's deep and
it makes you think so that has been one
of my favorites
my last favorite of this month is this
and it's a makeup bag by a company
called 38th and co they just have their
own Etsy store and the owner makes all
of these by hand I've been looking for a
good makeup bag for so long that will
actually fit my makeup brushes because
usually make a bag won't fit a brush
this long but these fit them perfectly
and they're really cute but I have a
little surprise for you guys I'm giving
