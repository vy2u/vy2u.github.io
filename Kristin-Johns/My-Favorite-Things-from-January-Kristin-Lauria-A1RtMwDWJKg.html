you all of my favorite things from the
month of January and I'm actually kind
of sad that January is over because it
was a really really fun month actually I
have to film one of these videos since
like August I actually have only ever
filmed one favorites idea so I said I
need to film another favorites video
especially for a month that was really
one of my favorite months so let's just
get started first favorite of this month
is this blush by Maybelline and it's the
master highlight blush and mauve and I
actually used this in my last video
which was my all drugstore makeup look
so if you want to see this in action
then I'll link that video down below but
I love this blush so much it's pretty
much the only blush I've been using all
month and I just feel like it's really
unique because it gives your skin just a
really really natural like flush of like
pinky and it's perfect for everyday and
I just love it a lot
my next favorite is this bronzer by
hourglass and it is the radiant bronze
light bronzer I got this for Christmas
so I really have been using it everyday
since I got it so I've been using it all
of January I feel like a lot of the
times bronzers are kind of hard to blend
out it takes a while to really get in
there and make it look natural but this
really blends out so fast and it has a
really natural finish and I just love it
a lot so I highly recommend this bronzer
by hourglass next favorite is actually
two lip products and the first one is by
bite and it's actually one of their
lipsticks that comes with 2 in it which
is genius because you can just throw it
in your purse and you have two lipsticks
and not one this is the first one and
that's called cafe and the second one's
a little bit darker and it's called
pepper and I've mainly been using this
one because this is just like my
all-time favorite color they make your
lips feel so hydrated and soft and
they're just amazing so I've been
wearing these all the time and I've also
been using this one by Tarte and it's
the matte lip surgence and hope I've
just been using all of these so much
like pretty much every single day so I
love these a lot and they were
only a favorite this month the next
thing I want to share with you guys is
actually so exciting because I know you
guys have been asking me about this for
a while and it is what i whiten my teeth
with and i've actually been using this
for about two months now and the brand
is actually called white with style and
i just think that's a really cute name
and it comes with a little teeth tray a
little LED light and the syringe with
the gel in it the whitening gel and this
stuff makes your teeth like way whiter
within just like be first use like i use
this one time and i was like i'm gonna
take a picture before and see if it
really does make my teeth like seven
shades whiter because that's what they
say on the box and then it really did
make my teeth so much wider I was like I
did not think my teeth for that yellow
before I used it so it doesn't make my
teeth feel since it like some other
teeth whitening stuff did so I highly
recommend it to you guys they're looking
for a new teeth whitening kit or
anything to whiten your teeth with they
gave me a coupon code and it's only
gonna be $28 for the whole kit so I'll
link that right here and I'll link it
down below if you guys are interested
my next favorite this month I'm actually
wearing right now and it's these
eyelashes and they're by the brand Coco
and they're called the goddess lashes
and they are my favorite fake eyelashes
that I've ever worn ever I feel like
fake eyelashes add so much to a makeup
look they just like kind of complete
everything and I've actually been having
trouble finding ones that look really
natural so I've really been loving these
my next favorite is a new addition to my
skincare routine and it is this eye
cream by benefit and it's called it's
potent actually just got back from
California cuz I was visiting Marcus and
when I'm in California my skin gets so
dry because the air is just way more dry
than it is in Florida so I was using
this whole time and it is just the best
stuff ever it makes your outer eyes feel
so soft when you wake up in the morning
and then your makeup just goes all the
way better so I've been
really loving this and I think it is
definitely gonna be a permanent addition
into my skincare routine it also comes
in just the cutest bottle ever it has
like a little cork lid and it's just
really cute my next favorite thing is
this one year Bible for women and I
started this January first and it gives
you a plan to read through the whole
Bible in one year and it's made it so
easy to go through and read the whole
Bible because it gives you a like a plan
for every day so it'll give you a
passage from the Old Testament a passage
from the New Testament and then like a
Psalms and proverbs and so I just think
it's perfect for anyone that gets like
overwhelmed with what to read in the
Bible or anything like that because I
know I feel like that a lot of times I
feel like I don't even know what to read
because there's so much to read so I'm
really happy that I started doing that
and I'm really excited because I've
never read through the whole Bible and
I'm really excited to do that favorite
of the month is these booties and
they're by the brand Cupid I got them
online but I don't remember the site of
Gotham on but I'll link them down below
I have been looking for black booties
for so long so I was so happy when I
finally found these and they came the
mail and they fit and they're so comfy
and they're just perfect they have a
little heel and it's really comfy to
walk in these and then a little zipper
in the back and I just love them and if
you're looking for black booties I
really recommend these because they're
so comfortable and they go with
everything and they're amazing I love
them okay guys that is the end of this

great January and please comment down
