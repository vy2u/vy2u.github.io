because I'm finally filming my first
youtube video I've been waiting a while
to do this and I'm just really glad that
I'm finally sitting down and doing it um
after me Marcus film a video on his
channel a lot of you guys said that you
would like to see me start one so that's
what I'm doing today and I thought that
for my first video it would be cool for
you guys to get to know me a little bit
better so I asked you guys on instagram
to leave any questions or things you'd
like me to answer on this video and so
you guys left so many great questions so
I picked them to answer today and yes so
let's just get started with the first
question well this is good because this
gets sitting right here but the first
question is how many pets do you have I
have two pets of my own biscuit is one
of them this is biscuit we rescued him
he was actually gonna get up put down
because he had a lot of infections like
he had a respiratory infection and so we
me and my roommates fostered him for a
while and then I decided to adopt him so
yeah that's biscuit he's about three
months old I think and if you hearing
crazy noises throughout this video it's
probably biscuit wrestling a sock over
there and I also have a fish next
question
where are you from I'm from Long
originally from Baton Rouge Louisiana
and then when I was in fifth grade I
moved to Orlando Florida and now I live
in Tallahassee Florida I'm going to
split for two steak and yeah so I'm
originally from Baton Rouge Louisiana
what will your channel be about I got
that question quite a few times um I'm
thinking that my channel is mainly gonna
be about beauty
and fashion and Jesus and I like doing
like crafts and stuff so I think I'll be
doing a lot of stuff with that and like
DIYs um yeah I think that that's kind of
what my channel is going to be back and
I hope that it's just very positive and
happy and just somewhere where you guys
can just hang out me and I can get to
know you guys better and I think that
this is a great way for me to connect
with a lot of you guys so yeah I'm just
really I'm really excited about finally
starting my youtube channel anything
that you guys would want to see just
comment below and I'll do a video about
that
can you speak Spanish no I cannot speak
Spanish I'm actually that was actually
one of my worst classes in high school I
think I took three years of Spanish and
head oh I don't even know if I can
remember one thing I remember how to say
perro
and gato which is dog and cat I believe
so yeah I wish I could speak another
language but unfortunately I can't what
is my worst fear I know exactly what my
worst fear is driving at night and
running out of gas like being all myself
that is my worst fear ever I just don't
even know what you could do in that
situation like if your phone was dead
and you run out of gas and you're in the
middle of nowhere I just thought it's my
worst nightmare it kind of makes my hand
sweat just thinking about it
um what is your favorite food Krispy
Kreme original glazed donuts those are
the few best things that have ever
existed
earth I could eat probably ten Krispy
Kreme Doughnuts in like five minutes
ouch ooh a lot of people ask this what
is your favorite bible verse and I wrote
down a few that are my favorites but
I'll just read one and I'll leave the
other ones in the description box so
that y'all can go read those if you
would like to know but I chose
Ecclesiastes 3:11 and it says yet God
has made everything beautiful for its
own time he has planted eternity in the
human heart but even so people cannot
see the whole scope of God's work from
beginning to end and I love that verse
because it just reminds me that when
things are going wrong or I'm having a
horrible day or something sad happens I
just rested the assurance that like God
knows what's going on and he he had the
plan that is so much greater than
anything I could ever imagine so that is
definitely one of my favorite verses
next question is what is your major and
what do you want to do my major is media
communications at FSU and my dream job
would be to own or work for a non-profit
that opens orphanages in different
countries that is like my dream and yeah
that that would be my dream just working
for a nonprofit that helps open
orphanages and gives jobs to people like
widows or people that are in poverty in
third-world countries I would
yeah so we can end on this question
because I love this question what is
your favorite animal
my favorite animal and the whole wide
world is a Golden Retriever they are by
far my favorite animals in the whole
world my favorite like domestic animals
my favorite like exotic animal would be
a red panda okay guys I think that that
is it for today I will try to have them
posted very soon well I want to post a
video like once a week or once every
other week so so yeah that's really
exciting and I'm actually leaving
tomorrow to go to LA so maybe me and
Marcus can film a video together and I
can maybe have that posted soon but okay
but thank you guys so much for watching
and thank you for all your sweet
comments on Instagram and thanks for
talking to me on Twitter and I love you
guys so much and I hope that I see you
guys soon have a very safe week and I
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
