you all about my fitness and how I stay
in shape how I stay healthy and all that
kind of stuff and I really think this
probably my most requested video ever
ever since I started YouTube everyone
always asks me how do you stay in shape
blah blah blah and when I first started
YouTube I was actually at a place in my
life a place in my life that sounds so
serious
I was actually never working out like I
didn't do anything to stay in shape or
anything like that
I really just didn't do anything so I
knew I couldn't do that video back then
but now that I've started working out
over the past year I figured I should
make this video for you guys and tell
you kind of what I like to do to stay in
shape what I do in the gym my whole
fitness routine I wrote down a ton notes
on my phone because I didn't want to
forget anything to tell you guys I
literally have like a huge list to tell
you guys so let's just start with like
my history of fitness that sounds like a
really boring class at college in high
school I worked out a lot because I
played volleyball and I did club
volleyball so the whole year I was
training for volleyball and that's how I
guess I kind of stayed fit throughout
high school but then once I got to
college I didn't have that routine
anymore and I was pretty happy with the
way that my body looked so I didn't
really feel like I needed to go to the
gym or anything like that
I started birth control the summer of my
sophomore year of college and I started
birth control because I had horrible
cramps when I did have my period and my
period was very irregular so we just
wanted to see if being on birth control
would help that so that summer was the
first time I ever really gained weight I
probably gained like 15 to 20 pounds
yeah about that much and that was the
first time that I really felt like oh
about my body like I just felt really
like I knew I was bigger than I used to
be and
I didn't know whether it was because the
birth control or whether like my
metabolism had just slowed down or
whatever but I was not happy and I was
like I need to start working out or
something which I'm not saying I was
like really overweight or anything it
was just more overweight than I had been
in a while so that summer I started kind
of working out just like going to the
gym a little bit trying to eat a little
bit healthier but nothing was really
working because I think it really was
the birth control that was making me
gain weight so I got off the birth
control and I was like I'm never going
back on that again because that was
horrible and so at the beginning of my
junior year I still wanted to continue
working out because I just felt better
about my body I wanted to get stronger
and healthier so I found this thing on
Instagram called bikini body guide by
Kayla it's honest I think that's how you
say her name and I'm sure a ton of you
guys have heard about it it's an e-book
and she just gives you a bunch of
different exercises to do and it's a
12-week program and I saw all the
different transformations and stuff and
I was like dang this looks good so I got
it and I started it and it is super hard
but I'll go more into the exercises in
that in a little bit but before I get
into like the specifics of the exercises
that I love most and kind of how I
exercise I just want to give y'all some
tips of what has helped me so much in
working out and not feeling so
overwhelmed before I workout because
like I don't know what to do so every
week I try to aim for working out at
least like four to five times a ton of
times I don't do it that much but that's
usually just like the goal I set for
myself and every time before I workout I
try to stretch for at least five to ten
minutes and that really helps prevent
injury and just helps get your body
warmed up and ready before your workout
also always when I go to the gym I bring
a water bottle I bring my headphones and
I bring a towel to wipe up all the sweat
I am going to produce but the headphones
that have changed my life when it comes
to working out are these and they're the
beats power beats wireless headphones
and I used to always use just like the
little apple headphones but when I was
doing the bikini body guide workouts as
you'll see in a minute it's a lot of
like ply
Metrix jumping up and down using your
body and so those would always fall out
of my ear and I couldn't listen to music
so I would do those workouts without any
music and it was kind of like death you
just put them in your ear like this and
they wrap around your ear and they don't
go anywhere so you can jump up and down
and also you don't have cords hanging
everywhere I just put them around my
neck so then it's just like Bluetooth
with your phone and if you're looking
for headphones app and if you're looking
for headphones that you're able to use
when working out if you're jumping
around even running these make it so
much easier and the sound quality is
obviously really good because they're
Beats and they're just amazing and these
make my workouts a hundred times better
also I wanted to mention my favorite
clothing brand for workout clothes and
that is aloe yoga and they have the best
most comfiest yoga clothes and I'm
wearing some of their pants right now
maybe I should stand up so you guys can
see them better these are the pants
they're super cute and that they feel
just so comfortable on also wearing one
of their sports bras it's matching the
pants so I feel super cute and the back
of it is really cute too I also wanted
to mention that my diet has changed a
lot since I started working out I really
try to stay away from processed foods
and I try to make a lot of my food at
home and I'm going to start doing what I
eat in a day videos so I can kind of
show you more of like my diet and what I
like to eat to stay healthy but I feel
like that would make this video really
long if I included that so just stay
tuned for that video so as I was saying
I like to use the bikini body guide as
my guide to workout and it gives you
circuits for Monday Wednesday and Friday
it's a 12-week program I've been through
the program on once through and now I'm
on week 5 of doing it again
I really have seen a huge difference in
my body I have become way stronger and
way healthier I will warn you the
circuits are deathly they're not deathly
they're just really freaking hard and
you sweat your butt off it's an amazing
workout and it really tests your mental
strength it really does
like every time before I do one of the
circuits
I literally pray like God please help me
get through this because this is so dang
hard so uh I'm just warning you it is
very hard if you want to check it out
but I have seen a huge difference I
think that my body is way stronger now
but I like to do that three times a week
and then on the other days I usually
like to run or do like more heavy
lifting or I even do like spin class
yoga something like that and now I will
insert some clips of my favorite
workouts that I like to do you can do a
lot of these at home and you can also do
some of them at the gym and here they
are so like I said I really like to
start out my workouts by stretching a
little bit and I just like to stretch my
arms my legs and this just will prevent
any injuries or pulling any muscles it
also really helps warm your body up
before you start your main workout this
first workout is jumping lunges and this
really increases your heart rate and
it's really good for your legs and it's
kind of like cardio and then these
kettlebell pulls are really good for
your shoulders your arms your butt and
your legs so it's kind of like a
three-in-one workout and these are
really good and you can definitely do
these at home this one is also very hard
it targets your lower abs and all you
need is one of those big old bouncy
balls I'm not really sure what they're
called but you just tap it against the
wall really lightly and it works your
abs really well this is my favorite ab
workout it really targets your lower and
upper abs and it's so hard butts so good
this last workout is Commandos and these
really target your arms as well as your
core and you can definitely do these at
home and you will definitely feel the
burn okay guys I hope the
you like this video and I just don't
want to in this video without telling
you guys being healthy means feeling
healthy and feeling good it does not
mean being skinny or losing weight
it just means loving your body and
having a healthy body so I don't want to
encourage you guys like go try to lose
weight that's not what this video is by
any means it's just a video showing you
