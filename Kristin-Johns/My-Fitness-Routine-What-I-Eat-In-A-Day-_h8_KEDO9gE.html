from the title I am going to be showing
you what I eat today what I eat in the
day and I'm also going to be updating
you guys on my fitness routine because I
did a fitness routine video about a year
ago and a lot has changed since then
first I am starving so I'm going to go
in the kitchen and cook some lunch
because for breakfast I'll show you what
I had for breakfast but it wasn't very
difficult then we will get into more of
the Fitness kind of stuff but before I
start I am going to be mentioning the
app life some throughout this video life
some is a really amazing app that has
been helping me keep track of a bunch of
my health goals and things like that so
if you guys are looking for an app to
kind of help you stay on track with your
fitness goals or your healthy lifestyle
goals I would definitely recommend life
some it's super easy to use okay so
since this is a what I eat in the day
video I will show you what I have for
breakfast even though it's kind of a sad
breakfast because it's just been
actually just had a Clif Bar because I
was running out the door I had to go to
my hair appointment and I was trying to
clean up a half morning and I just did
not have time to make breakfast so I
just ate a Clif Bar which is not ideal
for breakfast because it's not like a
full meal but it's good for when you're
in a rush so I really like the crunchy
peanut butter kind and I actually ate
the last one today so there's no more in
my box but for lunch I'm going to be
having something a little bit more
hearty a little bit more exciting so
what I'm going to be making is a sweet
potato bowl just cook some sweet
potatoes usually the night for since
they take a really long time to cook in
the oven and so I just have my little
ticket case here that are already cooked
basically all I do is I put a ton of
yummy toppings on them and so the
ingredients I'm going to be using today
are some peanut butter I have some honey
some ground cinnamon some plain Greek
yogurt some coconut flakes that I need
to get some more of some chia seeds
and also some granola so here are the
finished sweet potato bowls I guess you
call them a bowl or you can just call
them a sweet potato if you want and then
I just have a glass of lemon water okay
so I just finished my lunch and that is
one of my favorite things eat the soup
Hannibal because it's just so delicious
and also it's really filling so I love
that and I also finished my water which
was good
I haven't actually drinking too much
water is there something that I've been
doing lately is using the app called
life thumb which I mentioned earlier it
can actually track your water intake on
it which I love cuz I'm so bad at
drinking the right amount of water day
so so far today I've had three glasses
so you can see here I have the three
glasses filled up all you do is tap it
and it fills it up so you can keep track
so I have another so now I'm halfway
through with my water intake for the day
you want some lunch
are you ready I'm going to get you a big
scoop oh it's that one that fell please
is it lunch time it is lunch look how
cute this bowl is it looks so cute
good boy you have to have a healthy diet
too also this was in the bathroom but
look how cute his water bowl is Wow keep
thanks for a cute cup right
okay so now I wanted to talk to you guys
a little bit about my fitness routine
because I know I get a lot of questions
about it and I did do a video about it
over a year ago but a lot has changed
since that video so I decided I needed
to update you guys and so the first
thing I think I'll talk about is the
different workouts that I do because I
think that's like the main thing that
you guys want to know about so now that
I live in LA I would say I have a lot
more options I guess or just kind of
different options than I had when I was
in college and living in Florida so I
would say my first favorite exercise is
hiking la has amazing hiking trails and
it's a great workout it really gets your
heart rate up and another thing that I
do is this thing called class Pass which
my sister-in-law Lexie actually told me
about and I think they have class paths
in a bunch of different states in
America but basically you get to sign up
for class pass and then you pay monthly
and then you get access to a ton of
different workout studios in your area
and I usually like to go to spin classes
I go to Pilates I do
different like circuit classes boot
camps all these different things and the
reason that I love that is because I
don't get bored because I was doing the
kala bikini body guide which if you
don't know what that is it's kind of
just like a circuit training for twenty
eight minutes and you're supposed to do
it three times a week and I was doing
that for a really long time I've been
through that thing like three different
full times and I was just getting so
bored of it and I just wanted to try
something different oh and I forgot
another thing that I just started with
Marcus we actually signed up for an
Ultimate Frisbee summer league team so
we've been playing ultimate frisbee and
that is such a hard workout another
thing that I have kind of discovered
about myself and about working out and
fitness and health is how important that
physical activity is not only for my
physical health I also think is it
equally as important for my mental
health because I remember I moved when I
moved to LA the first month I didn't
really work out at all or I was doing
something maybe like one
every two weeks just like a random
workout and I was feeling so tired and
sad and I was just feeling so bull you
know what I'm saying and then once I
started getting on a consistent workout
routine I just felt so much more
energetic so much happier so much more
driven to get things done and I just
think that that is the most important
thing to remember about Fitness is that
yeah it's great to look good and strong
and feel healthy but also just getting
out and being active just boosts your
mental health so much so speaking of
hiking we and we as an nhien camper are
on our way to Lexi and Cody's house
because me and Lexi are going to go
hiking and then I think we are going to
grill out at their house so I'll be sure
to show you my dinner of course stuck in
traffic because la what else can you
expect what do you think about the
traffic Weedle
Nathan
okay tell us what's for dinner I don't
even know haiman steak and some type of
rice grilled shrimp veggies farro with
tomatoes mozzarella and basil and steak
so I just got back from Kody and Lexi's
house it was so much fun we had an
amazing dinner and our hike was so good
and so I'm going to show you guys what I
always like to do before I go to sleep I
always like to put in what I exercise
for that day in to my life's imap so all
I have to do is go to the little
exercise tab and then I do add exercise
and then I type in whatever I did
whether it's spin class hiking running
whatever it is so I just did hiking and
then you put in how long you did it so I
did 60 minutes of hiking and then I can
kind of keep track throughout my week
which days I was more active which days
I was less active if you guys are
looking for something to kind of help
you keep track of your exercise your
water intake all the things that you
need throughout the day I would
definitely recommend life some the link
will be in my description box if you
guys want to download it for free it
seriously has helped me so much to keep
track of all that kind of stuff and it's
just nice to have a separate thing kind
of keeping you accountable whether it be
a journal or an app or a person any type
of accountability is just so helpful so
I would definitely recommend that before
I leave you guys I just want to tell you
a little analogy that I thought of on
the way home and I know that might sound
really weird but I really like analogies
and I'm not sure if this will make sense
because I just thought it and I haven't
told anyone it yet so you guys are the
first ones to hear it but on my way home
I almost missed my turn because I was so
focused on getting through a yellow
light that I almost missed the turn that
was going to take me into my
neighborhood and then I was thinking
that's a lot like fitness journeys or
really anything in life because you can
just be so focused on the end result
like I really want a really cute body
for summer I want to lose all this
weight I want to look great
being so focused on that one end goal
you can actually miss the actual thing
that you need to do which is just to get
your body healthy and feeling good and
doing something good and positive for
your life which is your actual turn you
should go down not be so focused on
making that yellow light you should be
more focused on reaching sustainable
goals and getting there in a healthy way
and not rushing through to get through
the yellow light to get to a quick goal
and maybe do things a more healthy way
so I don't know if that makes sense but
it made sense in my head and hopefully
when I'm editing this I don't sound
really stupid but I just want to
encourage you guys don't forget to be
healthy and don't put too much pressure
on yourself to look perfect because
perfection is just not even a thing I
love you guys so much and I really
appreciate you watching this video if
you did like this video please give it a
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
maybe I can do a more in-depth kind of
like workout routine video like take you
guys with me to spin class or something
one day let me know if you want to see
that but I love you guys so much my
camera is about to die well I love you
okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
