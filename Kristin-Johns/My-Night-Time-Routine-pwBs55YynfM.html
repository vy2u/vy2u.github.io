you along with me and up my nighttime
routine so usually I come home and I'm
greeted by the dogs of course they get
so excited
even if I've been gone for like two
seconds they are equally as excited as
if I've been gone for the entire day so
I make sure to pet them love them and
then I have to tell them to get off the
bed because they will pee if they
haven't peed in a while so I'm like
honey get off the bed and go potty and
then the first thing I like to do is get
comfy so I take off my cute clothes and
get straight into my pajamas and then I
get the room ready for my cozy vibe so I
like to set a candle and I always
diffuse some essential oils like lemon
and lavender before I go to sleep and
these really helped me a fall asleep and
be helped the room smell really nice and
fresh because we do have dogs so we got
to keep the house smelling good and then
it is time to shower every night I
shower except tonight I'm not going to
because I already showered earlier in
the day but I am gonna brush my teeth
like always we only have one sink in our
bathroom so me and Marcus always fight
over who's gonna get to the water and he
likes having the really bright lights on
but I always make him turn them off
because they're so blinding and then I'm
gonna wash my face using the first aid
Beauty facial cleanser I've used this
for years now and then tonight I'm going
to be doing a mask and I'm gonna be
using the hello fab ginger and tumeric
vitamin C
jelly mask this mask has amazing
ingredients in it like ginger extract
tumeric extract vitamin C and I'm gonna
leave that on for 10 minutes and while
I'm waiting I'm gonna feed the dogs
their dinner because they gotta eat
then I'm gonna wash my face off and just
realize how stinking smooth my skin
feels after that mask and to moisturize
my skin tonight I'm gonna be using the
hello fab coconut water cream this is a
great moisturizer because it's
formulated with coconut water and it has
a bunch of other ingredients that's
gonna make your skin just feel really
really refreshed I love putting this on
for bed because you wake up with the
softest skin and every night before bed
I put castor oil on my eyelashes this is
like my secret tip to amazing long thick
eyelashes and I'm also going to be
putting on my glasses and tonight and
made my favorite hot chocolate Marcus
asks for this hot chocolate all the time
because it's so good so I'll leave the
rescue down below if you want
and then I'm just gonna add my
marshmallows on top and bless my husband
with the best drink of all times it's so
good and then it's time for bed I always
bring the dogs up on the bed with me and
then Marcus usually gets in bed a little
bit after me and then we just lay and
snuggle with the dogs and we usually
fall asleep to a movie or Netflix or
something like that and that's it that's
my entire nighttime routine I hope you
