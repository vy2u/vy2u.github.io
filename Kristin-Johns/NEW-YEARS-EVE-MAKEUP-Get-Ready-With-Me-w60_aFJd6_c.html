you how I created this makeup look which
is going to be the makeup that I am
wearing for New Year's which is so
exciting I wanted to do a makeup look
that anybody can do it's super easy but
it also looks very nice and put together
and a little bit bold so I didn't use
any glitter today I know that's pretty
traditional for New Year's looks but I
didn't use any glitter because I feel
like glitter can be kind of annoying to
work with but I really hope that you
guys enjoy this makeup look and all the
products will be linked down below
including what I'm wearing and all the
good stuff like that so I really love
you guys and let's just get started okay
guys before I start this makeup look for
this very festive makeup look I have to
point out something even though you can
probably already see it but look at my
little lights I got them for Christmas
they make Scrooge backs to show you
aren't they so cute I love them so much
I just had to point that out because
they're making me very happy in the
background of my video so for today's
makeup I'm gonna start out with primer
and foundation because we're not doing
super dramatic eyes so it won't mess up
our base so I'm going to be using this
most day a fancy makeup I've ever owned
it's the girl on lower I think the play
say that gold infused primer let's just
take a moment because this stuff
actually has gold in it but this stuff
is actually very good I've been using it
for a while now and I only used a tiny
bit of it and I just put it on with my
fingertips
um but it has actual little gold flakes
in it that dissolve once you put it on
your face and this primer is really good
for firming your face
like if you have any wrinkles it will
probably like suck up all the wrinkles
but the reason that I really like it is
because if I ever feel like my face is
like puffy in the morning I feel like
this really just like deep puffs it and
makes my foundation going really nicely
and then today for foundation I have
another very
fancy thing that I've been using a lot
lately and this is the Dior skin air
flash foundation and this foundation is
so good it's a little bit light for me
right now so I'm going to be mixing it
with a little bit of a darker foundation
but I just like to spray it right on my
Beauty Blender like this and then just
pop it all over my face I've heard that
a lot of people don't like this
foundation because it gets everywhere
but I've never applied on my face but
because I think that's what makes it go
everywhere but when I just spray it
close to my Beauty Blender it's not
messy at all and I really really like
the way it makes my skin look it's super
natural looking but it also has pretty
good coverage so I really like that
foundation ok so now I'm going to be
using the Naked skin by urban decay
concealer I'm in the shade light neutral
I've been using this concealer for like
two years now I've already gone through
like two other tubes I really really
love this stuff I can't believe that
2016 is over it's very strange to me
because I feel like I just celebrated
New Year's for 2016 like a week ago this
year went by so fast and I think that
the reason it felt like it went by so
fast is because so much stuff happened
in 2016 like I got engaged I graduated
college
my sister had her first baby like so
much fun exciting stuff happened like
huge life events that I just made 2016
feel like it went by so fast I do not
know what happened to this stuff it just
like the top all cracked off now the lid
won't stay shut and now I just use it
with some duct tape on it and I think
it's time for a new one but I love this
powder and I'm just gonna be putting
this under my eyes and set my face um
but one thing that I really learned in
2016 was how important perspective is
like if you have a positive outlook in
perspective about your future positive
and
things are going to happen down below
what your favorite part of 2016 was I'm
really curious to know and now I'm going
to move on to the rest of my face which
is held in this little palette right
here this is by hourglass and this
palette is what dreams are made of I
love this palette so much and when you
open it up you got all little midians
you got your setting powder bronzer two
blushes and a highlighter so I'm going
to be using all of these today and this
palette goes with me everywhere I travel
with it all the time I use it every
single day this is probably one my
favorite makeup products that I've
discovered in 2016 it's just so first
I'm going to be using it being a little
bronzer that comes in here I'm just
going to be putting that on my
cheekbones I love our glass bronzers
because there's something about them
that just like blurs any weird texture
on your skin it just makes your skin
look so soft like soft focus on this and
then I'm going to be using this blush
right here which I've been using every
day for probably two months now it's an
amazing blush I'm just going to go ahead
and say this is my favorite blush of all
time if this blush is not sold
separately I'm gonna be very sad because
I'm going to run out of this so soon I
know I will because I use it all the
time but it's just a really pretty
neutral blush that goes with everything
and it just makes your skin look so nice
and awake and happy but the final thing
I'm going to be using from this palette
is this highlighter right here and this
is a super soft highlighter it's not
like bling bling or anything like that
but it's just super natural and it makes
your skin look very healthy very pretty
so I really like this highlighter and
it's so nice that you have everything in
this palette wow it's so handy okay now
I'm going to do my eyebrows I'm just
going to do
them like I always do using the
Anastasia brow powder and soft brown and
a little angled brush and now that face
is done I'm just going to prime my eyes
and zoom you guys in so you can see it
the eye shadow so today for my eye
shadow I'm going to be using this little
palette right here it has a line on the
front because it's called you protect
the Lyons eye palette this is by the
brand Shawn Takei I think I'm saying
that right and some of the proceeds from
this palette actually go to protecting
Alliance which i think is really special
so I'll open it up and show you guys
this beauty this is what the palette
looks like and then you open it up and
you have four super beautiful shades
like a speechless at how pretty these
eyeshadows are they're so pretty and
they actually have lions and bossed in
the eyeshadow so you can't get much
cooler than this eyeshadow palette but
first I'm going to take a little bit of
this bronze color and I'm going to run
that through my crease and this is
called African topaz I love using this
palette because all the shadows are
super unique but also very wearable you
know how sometimes I get eyeshadow
palettes and they have really pretty
shades that are really unique but you're
like I might never really wear that but
all these shades I've been wearing a lot
and they're very very pretty very easy
to blend and just looking at the palette
makes me very happy because I just get
to see a little Lyons on my eyeshadow
and then I'm going to take this shade
right here which is the white one and
it's called
sand and I'm going to put that all over
my lid no matter what eyeshadow look I'm
doing I always like to put a light shade
in the inner corners of my eyes just
because it really makes your eyes look
more open and awake and more bright so I
always always use a light shade to kind
of brighten and open up my eyes even if
I'm doing a smokier look or a simple
look this makes all the difference and
then I'm going to go in to this shade
right here this is called oh boy can't
pronounce it I think it's called
Amboseli and
I'm going to take that on a Mac 217
brush and I'm just going to really
lightly put that on the very outer
corner of my eye just to give it a
little bit more depth and just deepen
everything up a tad bit and then I'm
just going to take a little angle brush
that doesn't have anything on it and
blend everything out and if you're
curious to where you can get this
palette you can get it at Nordstrom you
can also get this palette and all other
makeup that I'm using today but I know
that these two are limited-edition so if
you are curious about them or you would
like to try them out I would definitely
get them soon so that they don't sell
out now I'm just going to take a little
bit of liner and run that along my lash
line since we're going to be putting on
some false lashes today even though I'm
not allowed because I've eyelash
extensions I'm being a rebel so I left
the lower lash line completely blank so
that it's just brighter and more simple
and I'm going to pop on some false
lashes and I'll be right back okay so
the lashes are on and they made all the
difference and the last thing to do is
our lips so I'm going to start by using
a lip liner because I am using a dark
berry look and it's always best to line
your lips because it's going to make it
last longer it's going to make it less
streaky and it's just all-around easier
to put on dark lipsticks if you have a
lip liner underneath and it takes for
lipstick I'm going to be using the
Charlotte Tilbury glastonbury lipstick
it's just this beautiful dark berry
shade one thing that I love about this
lipstick is how dang white it makes your
teeth look oh I got phone line - that's
one kill so if you're looking for a
really pretty deep berry color I would
definitely recommend this color because
it's beautiful it's super comfy to wear
and it makes your teeth look like a
little pearls and that is it for this
makeup look I really hope that you guys
liked it if you did like it please give
it a big thumbs up and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel also don't
forget I'll have all these products
linked down below in case you are
interested and if you
create this look on your own or do a
version of it please send me pictures on
Instagram or Twitter I really love you
guys I hope you have an amazing New
Year's I will see you in 2017 bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
