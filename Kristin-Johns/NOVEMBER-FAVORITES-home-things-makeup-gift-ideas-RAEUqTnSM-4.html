my November favorites and just because
it is so close to Christmas I decided to
put on a red lipstick and a very festive
little jumpsuit because I am feeling the
holiday spirit and my first favorite of
the month is something that would
actually make an amazing gift to any of
your friends any of your family maybe
even a gift to yourself but they are
these locks Etan gift sets this one is
the lavender gift set so it comes like
this with some tissue paper and then you
have a bunch of products in here so you
get the lavender foaming bath which I
use all the time I love this stuff
basically the lock seat on lavender
scent is just so amazing it's so
relaxing so you get that you also get
the lavender perfume sachet and what I
like doing with these is putting them in
my sock drawer or I even like putting
them in my closet just to make my
clothes smell really good so you can
basically use this for anything you also
get a little mini lavender hand cream
you get a lavender body lotion and it
last but not least you get a hand wash
in here so basically you get to try a
ton of different products from the line
and the other thing that I have that
would make a great gift is the Box Etan
advent calendar now this is just the
cutest thing I've ever seen so the
packaging looks like this and on the
back you have everything that you're
gonna be getting in here so there's
shower gels there's hand cream basically
a ton of different things from the lock
seat on line and you open the little
ribbon and this is the best part
look how stinking adorable this is so I
just wanted to show you guys these
because it is holiday season it is
gift-giving season and I think that
these are great gift ideas so now I'll
move on to makeup favorites of the month
that I've been loving and the first
thing is this palette by Tarte this is
the tartlet in bloom palette I've
actually been wanting this palette for
such a long time I got
for my sister-in-law Lexi I think two
Christmases ago and she still uses this
everyday she always tells me how it's
like her favorite palette ever and I'm
always like oh I wish that I had gotten
one but I just never got around to
buying it for myself and Tarte was so
kind and they actually sent this to me
with a bunch of their other products and
I have been using it non-stop so here
are what the colors look like they're
just so pretty and I think that the
reason I love this palette so much is
because every single one of these shades
is like right up my alley like right
exactly what I like to use on the daily
so you have your matte shades you have
your pretty shimmer shades for your lids
and then you have your deeper shades
that you can use this liner or to really
like smoke out your look so basically I
just love this it's a great travel
palette and like I said I got this for
my sister-in-law for Christmas a few
years ago so this would also make a
great Christmas present for somebody or
you could put it on your Christmas list
I also have another palette that I've
been loving but this is a face palette
this is the Kat Von D shade + light
contour palette I am just so mad at
myself for waiting so long to buy this
because now that I have it I understand
why everybody talks about it why it's
just the best thing ever so here's what
it looks like this is the shade that I
use the most I also use these two shades
sometimes to set underneath my eyes if I
want them a little bit brighter this
shade I'm a little bit nervous that I
think it might be too dark for me and
this shade I think would also work
perfect as a contour color for me but I
just have to say if you've been thinking
about getting this palette for a while
just do it because it is amazing the
powders are so so blendable and it never
looks too heavy on your cheeks it just
looks very natural I've also been loving
this brush this is the japonesque
buffing brush and I used this in a
recent get ready with me but a lot of
you guys were saying you couldn't find
it online which I thought was so weird
because it is online Ulta
but the reason it probably is hard to
find is because it comes in a set so
I'll make sure to link this brush down
below for you guys but basically this
has taken place of my Beauty Blender and
I use this to blend out my foundation
and my concealer I just can't see myself
parting ways with this any time soon
because it's amazing okay this next
product was a complete impulse buy I
wasn't planning on buying this at all
but then when I was in Sephora I was
just like oh maybe I should just try it
out but I ended up loving it this is the
eat Marc Jacobs dewdrops do you do drops
in the shade do you this product is
beautiful and I just have to say I I
seriously love it and I'm so glad I
ended up buying it here's what it looks
like put on my hand it's like a very
soft beautiful highlight and what I love
doing with this is on days where I'm not
wearing makeup I will put some of this
on the top of my cheekbones down my nose
and just like the places where you would
normally highlight and it looks
beautiful on bare skin and I also love
mixing this in with my foundation that's
what I did today I don't know if you can
really tell but my skin just feels a
little bit more luminous than normal
could also use it on your shoulders to
highlight I didn't do it today so I
don't know why I'm like trying to show
you but you can use it on your shoulders
and your collarbone and yeah I love this
even though and I know it's like a very
extra product I still do really like it
and my last makeup favorite of the month
are at the color pop blotted lips I have
4 different shades I have the shade on a
stick which is like a very hot pink
shade which I think this is the first
blotted lip that I got and I also have
the shade sucker which is a much more
wearable everyday shade it's kind of
like a coral nude color and I have the
shade candyfloss which I think this one
is the most popular shade of the blotted
lips and this is actually my favorite
one I love that shade
and then the last one I have is the
shade drip and I also wear this one a
lot it's more of like a purpley Mavi
nude color they seriously do just feel
like you blot it off your lipstick and
you're left with a really nice stain so
it's really easy to wear they're not
drying and they just look I don't know
they just look more subtle than a
regular creamy lipstick and they're less
drying than a normal matte lipstick so
they're kind of like the perfect hybrid
and also color pop is super affordable
so if you want to try one of these out I
think the shade I would recommend is
candy floss okay now we'll move on to
clothes the first thing I have to show
you guys are these bunny slippers these
are from ASOS and they are so soft
they're so cushiony and I've been
wearing them every single day when I get
out of bed and every single day when I
get back in bed so I just love these
they have a little tail at the bottom
and I don't know if I would necessarily
put these in my favorites if it weren't
for this reason these slippers wash in
the washer machine so well I've already
washed them like four separate times
because the dogs always think that
they're a toy so then they bring them
outside and then they get dirt all over
them so I thought why I put them in the
dryer that they would just completely
like fall apart but they are sturdy and
they held up and if you're looking for
really cute slippers
these are definitely my favorite I've
ever had and then my last favorites are
so random so just be prepared the first
one is this lemon squeezer and it's also
a lime squeezer if you didn't see my
vlog from the other day I have been
loving homemade lemonade and I make very
good homemade lemonade and it's all
because of this thing because you have
to squeeze a lot of lemons in order to
get the amount of lemon juice that you
need for lemonade so I've just been
using this pretty much every single day
I can't imagine my life without this
lemon squeezer because then I would have
to be squeezing everything my
and and this thing just makes so easy to
suppress your lemons but it really is a
favorite I would be lying to you guys if
I didn't include this in my favorites
video so if you want to make some
delicious lemonade then I would
definitely recommend this one it's by
your kitchen we actually got this as a
wedding gift but I'll try to find the
specific one and link it below if you
need the specific one but I'm sure any
lemon squeezer is great I had to mention
the Magnolia collection at Target
because chip and Joanna Gaines are my
freakin people I love them so much and I
had to go to Target and support their
new line at Target so I got a huge
amount of things I'll just show you two
of the things one is this candle this is
in the scent cardamom and bevit ear this
one really smells more like a boy's
perfume I mean a voice cologne but once
you light it it actually smells really
fresh and really good I've been burning
this a ton as you can see and it just
makes our room smell amazing I also got
another one of these but I can't
remember what scent it is but it's in my
Beauty room I also absolutely love the
pillows that they came out with their
collection with Target so I got this one
I also got one that's sitting back there
it's like the white one with little
black crosses on it it's really cute but
if you guys have not checked out the
Magnolia collection at Target I would
definitely recommend and my last
favorite of this month is my film camera
this is a Minolta Maxim 650 si and this
is kind of more of an automatic film
camera than I know a lot of people use
but Marcus got this camera for me for
Christmas last year and I had been
taking pictures all throughout the year
and finally got my first roll developed
and I fell in love with the way that the
pictures looked I was so nervous that
none of the pictures were gonna turn out
but it inspired me to make an entire
Instagram dedicated to my film photos so
if you want to follow along it's called
Kristin
film and I just post a bunch of the
pictures that I've got undeveloped and
I'm gonna keep posting the pictures as I
keep getting new rolls developed and I
keep getting better at film hopefully
one day I can be an expert at film and
answer all of your questions because I
know I get so many questions especially
on that Instagram about all about film
and how I take them and I am NOT an
expert by any means but if you are
curious to what film is you can
definitely probably find really good
YouTube videos about it there's just
something very special about film photos
because you only get one shot and that
shot really I don't know it's more
special than digital photos I just feel
like because it really captures an
authentic moment I don't know how to
explain it's just really cool so that is
my last favorite of this month I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
