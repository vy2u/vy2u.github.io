makeup challenge that's why I'm not
wearing any makeup right now and I'm
really excited also a little bit nervous
I think this is gonna be harder than it
sounds I am a little bit thick right now
so sorry if I sound kind of congested
because I am I just have like a stuffy
nose and my throat is a little bit
scratchy so that is why I probably sound
a little bit weird but I think that this
will make me feel better because this
will probably be very funny all my
mirrors are out of my room I can't see
anything so this is going to be very
interesting okay the first thing that
I'm going to do is put up my hair
because that's going to get all up in my
way now I'm going to cover my monitor up
with a t-shirt so I can still see that
it's recording but I won't be able to
see my face okay I'm kind of nervous now
the first thing I'm gonna do is
concealer and I'm scared and I'm going
to be mixing these two because this
one's a little bit too dark for me right
now and I'm just gonna put it on my face
or should I look in the mirror more see
where I have like zits and stuff I know
around my nose is red from me blowing it
so much and I have is it like here okay
this is really scary guys it's way
scarier than it seems like it would be
okay now I'm just gonna put a little bit
of this Maybelline instant age rewind
and light under my eyes I feel like I
put way too much concealer oh okay I'm
just gonna blend it out feel like that's
blended is it blended I wish you guys
could be like no it's not blended just
let me know one thing I do notice is
that I'm poking myself in the eye was my
makeup brush a lot more than I usually
do so that's healthy feels blended out
now I'm gonna do my foundation and I'm
choosing the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation
the color nude and putting a little bit
on my brush feel like foundation going
to be the easiest part just hopefully
it's all blend it out a so I just
blended my foundation out for like three
minutes straight so it better be blended
in all the way and now I'm going to set
my concealer with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder it feels so weird
okay now I'm going to set the rest of my
face and I'm going to use this brush
from benefit it's the blush slash powder
brush get a little bit on here
okay now my foundation is set I'm going
to what do I do next oh yeah I'm gonna
do all our dog hair on my lip thing to
do my bronzer and I'm going to be using
the hourglass bronzer and this has a
mirror in it so I'm going to cover it up
I'm not looking and take a little bit of
that on this all of my brushes have dog
hair on them okay I'm just gonna take a
little bit of this bronzer on this brush
little as my cheeks the brush sheds like
crazy so hopefully I don't have black
hairs all over my face I don't know how
do you blow nose I hope that I'm not
playing too much bronze around can't
answer Max's face time cuz then I'll see
my makeup so sorry Marcus next I'm going
to do my blush and I'm going to be using
Mac's warm soul and putting that on my
cheeks this is one the apples of your
cheeks really help them they're kind of
like a guideline they give you start
following off the apples then you know
you've gone too far out I'm gonna do
highlighter and I'm gonna be using this
one from Becca and this one also has a
mirror so I'm not gonna look in the
mirror and just put some of that on this
brush from Sigma think that's good
okay now I am going to do my eyebrows
which is one of the things that I am
most scared about and I'm just going to
take this little angle brush and the
Anastasia brow powder and let's just
pray that this works oh this is the hard
part
okay way harder than it looks I think I
really just messed that up okay I think
I'm just gonna go to the next eyebrow oh
no I think I went too high okay let's
just get done with the eyebrows I'm just
gonna take some clear brow gel and
hopefully this helps them a little bit
okay now I'm gonna do my eyeshadow and
first I'm going to prime my eyes using
Mac's Paint Pot and putting that on my
eyelid to make me have an even base for
this beautiful masterpiece I'm going to
create in a second okay so for eyeshadow
today I'm going to be using the lorac
Pro to go palette and this also has a
mirror in it so I'm not going to look
and I'm going to fold it over and I'm
gonna do a little bit more than just
like a natural look today because I want
to make it a little bit harder so I'm
going to go in to cafe which is just
like a matte neutral brown color and put
that in my crease the thing that's going
to be the scariest is the whole blending
aspect like I feel like it's not going
to be blended very good it's all just
gonna be kind of like plop in there now
I'm gonna put some of this color which
is mink on a just flat brush oh this
color is really dark I'm scared to put
this color okay I'm just gonna put this
on the outer corner of my eye
I'm so nervous for how it's gonna look
okay now I'm going to take this sparkly
brown color called chai and put that all
over my lid okay now I'm going to take
this blending brush and just try to
blend all this out now I'm just taking a
little bit of the highlighter that I
used and putting that on the inner
corner of my eye just to give it a
little bit of more highlight okay now
I'm going under the eyeliner which is
the scariest part because I feel like
this is where I could really go wrong so
I'm just going to take the eyeliner
always use which is Physicians Formula I
boost your in black and it's a liquid
eyeliner I do this every day so I feel
like I should do it well but who knows
I'm gonna attempt to do the wing this is
bad
oh no I know that Wayne didn't go in the
place I wanted it to go
it was bad I know that I know I bet I
messed that up okay just try I really
suck on that one okay I just messed up
again no I did it's like once you mess
up you can't fix it cuz who knows where
the messed up was you forget instantly
okay now I'm going to do the wing this
is going to be the opposite of eyeliner
on fleek literally the opposite okay
eyeliners done let's just move past that
horrendous job that I just did and now
I'm going to curl my eyelashes which
also is a very terrifying thing to do
that Amir mm yeah hook myself again no
big deal going blind after this video
probably okay feels curled
now I'm going to attempt to put some
mascara underneath my eyes that is the
eyes complete I think that they probably
stink oh nice um yes so let's just move
on to lips I'm going to be using Kat Von
D's Lolita and this is a pretty intense
liquid lipstick very easy to mess up so
yeah let's just see about this okay
feeling good
so that is the lips done I feel like
maybe it looks okay um at least I could
remember where my lips were because I
feel like I just forgot where my
eyebrows were so feeling feeling pretty
nervous to look oh it doesn't look as
bad as I thought hmm I went way
overboard of the bronzer but it doesn't
look horrible the eyeshadow surprisingly
isn't as bad as I thought it would be
excess blending really paid off the lips
are a little bit uneven but if they feel
really sticky for some reason like okay
so this is the eyes close up you can see
I really messed up on this eye and
actually I really messed up on both eyes
so but I think that the eye shadow
doesn't look as bad as I thought it
would and the cheeks don't look that bad
it's mainly just the eyeliner and that's
part I was most scared of so I'm feeling
