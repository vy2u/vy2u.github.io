loggin yeah what's up them vlog in and
we're about to start today by giving
camper a bath because we think it's not
a high possibilities that he has she's
got this for years to so we're going to
give you a free back oh alright
cammareri ready for going back oh yeah
that can't be helped it
oh man depression we shit I seriously
probably had five loads of laundry to do
today so I've gotten two of them done
next thing I have to do is wash all my
sheets and even this duvet insert them
how this got so dirty and I don't even
know how I think it's just because
camper gets on the bed all the time but
that's what I found out when you have a
dog you just really have to do way more
laundry but I wanted to show you guys
something I wanted to show you guys
these sheets before I stick them in the
laundry machine and then you won't be
able to see that this is what our sheep
look like they are from Target and
they're from the Nate Berkus collection
and I saw them and I was like wait these
are the cutest sheets I've ever seen in
my whole life I just want to show you
those because I think it's really hard
to find cute sheets I'm going to attempt
to show you guys how good Kimber is it
getting brush
okay so I just put some makeup on I got
dressed out of my pajamas I'll show you
guys a little outfit of the day
I'm wearing just a little cropped shirt
from brandy melville it's so soft and
then I'm just wearing some high-waisted
shorts these are actually from American
Apparel and I'm pretty sure American
Apparel went out of business or did they
I don't know so look at this I got this
burn from my curling iron the other day
and it looks so horrible oh I don't even
know how the heck I did that but I did
that okay but now I am going to go make
some lunch come hungry and thank you -
hello fresh for sponsoring this video I
am so happy to be working with
hellofresh because I have heard so many
good things about them and if you guys
don't know what hella fresh is it is a
meal kit delivery service so they
deliver you all your ingredients so that
it is super easy to just make your meals
you don't have to go to the grocery
store and I ordered this plastic box
they also have a veggie box and a family
box so you have those options and each
meal actually ends up being under ten
dollars and another thing that I'm very
excited about very happy how is that
they give you the directions
step-by-step with pictures which
pictures really help me visualize what
I'm supposed to be doing and all the
meals only take about 30 minutes which
is amazing so they really make this
beginner friendly and that's perfect
because I was saying I'm still in my
beginner stages of cooking I'm
definitely not a pro yet so today I'm
going to be making the do stuff I just
written down here is those how you
pronounce it it's desuka crusted chicken
and it has sweet potatoes and sugar snap
peas I'm a sucker for sweet potatoes so
this just looks very delicious to me go
I'm going to be making this for lunch
like I said
hello fresh also just introduced someone
breakfast option which is awesome
so you can have a breakfast lunch in
center David's office snaps got the
sweet potatoes climb and then we got
some sauce and then a chicken the good
thing about getting all of your
ingredients that you need is that
there's less food waste because I know
it's really easy to waste a ton of food
when you're cooking okay I'm going to
start the cooking but I'm going to put
you guys down here so you can see what
I'm doing and first I'm going to start
off by cutting sweet potato okay so now
these go in the oven
wait I don't think I'm gonna be able to
do this okay look at this
these are going to go in the oven for
about 25 minutes
I just finished cooking and I plated it
up look how good this looks
are you ready to see a delicious oh yeah
let's do it
you smell it oh good all day look at
that cheese Lay's potato and another
really good thing about whole fresh is
that they have two full-time dietitians
on their staff so they're making meals
that they know are healthy that
well that was thinking at delicious
Marcus is all I ate it all absolutely no
leftovers the only leftovers is my
little box of the bags and all of them
are recyclable so don't you forget to
recycle see a little recycle science
recycle so like I said that was my first
time using hello fresh but it was very
delicious and just the fact that it's so
convenient is so nice so if you guys are
interested in hello fresh you can use
the toad kristenjohn 38 to get $30 off
your first week of meals which i think
is a great deal so it's just kristenjohn
30 visit
the hellofresh website and you can get
that discount okay so on to the next
little activity of the day and that I
need to get done first
I need like hand wraps I'm pretty sure
he has to be I need to hang up some of
these posters that I bought at a little
farmers market they're so cute but my
picture frames finally came in these are
the prints that I'm putting hey you

putting in my kitchen
they can't but really want to come in

we cannot they're from a little market
in LA and I think they are the cutest
thing I ever did see hopefully hopefully
they're the right size I measured and
everything but you never know with
online orders you know I'm saying I
might need to go get to search for this
or I can just do it caveman style do not
bark anymore if I am not paying
attention to camper it 24/7
he is like Oh Brett he's like oh my gosh
you just owned me this is exactly what I
had on I like how it's not super thick I
bought a ton of frames from Ikea and
they're just so thick but I still still

want to put them in the kitchen campers

keeps me from going in the living room I
hate it and another thing that came in
the mail today are these popsicle molds

recipes for popsicles and it really made
me need popsicle molds and this is just
very cute I also got these on Amazon and
I have it to keep the little box that it
