for you because I know a lot of your
proms are coming up very soon so I
wanted to get this video up for you guys
and today I just did a more neutral eye
look because I wanted it to go with a
ton of different dress colors and then I
just added some old eyelashes so I hope
you guys like it and I think I wore
pretty much this exact same makeup look
and hairstyle for my prom in junior year
and senior year so if I can find
pictures to those I'll put them right
here but I really wish that I could go
to prom I love prom I thought it was
really fun even if you don't have a date
just going with your friends is so much
of us so I hope you guys like this
makeup look and let's just get started
so the first thing I'm going to be doing
today is using primer and primer is
really important especially for prom
night because you want your makeup to
last all night so I'm using Lancome
labate Pro I'm just taking a little bit
on my fingers and just rubbing that and
to my skin and I literally feel like
before every single prom or homecoming
or any big event I always always get is
it so obviously my face was like you're
doing a prom makeup book you're gonna
need a zit right there so I'm going to
start by concealing and I'm just going
to use this instant age rewind by
Maybelline I'm just going to take a
little bit on my finger and put that
right over my pesky zit and then I'm
just going to use my Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation that you guys know I use
all the time and I'm just going to put
that on the back of my Beauty Blender
and one that in then I'm going to use
the Maybelline age rewind underneath my
eyes to set my under eyes I'm going to
be using the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I just think that using the
Beauty Blender with a loose powder it
just works so good because it just
blends into your skin so well so I'm
just going to take about that much
underneath my eyes
and then just set my face I'm actually
going to be using Mac Studio Fix powder
and I'm in the color NC 35 I'm going to
be using this one on this huge gigantic
fluffy brush from it cosmetics and this
will just give me a little bit more
coverage next we are going to move on to
contouring and I don't really contour in
day to day life but for prom and with
pictures I think it looks really good
so I'm going to be taking the contour
kit by anastasiya and I'm just going to
be taking this middle shade it's just
kind of like a cool toned Brown and make
a little line now that you have these
two lovely lines we're going to blend
them out so I'm just going to take this
big Brush it's the III by morphe and
just work on kind of blending that out
now - just bronze up the face a little
bit I'm going to be using Mac's medium
dark mineralized skinfinish and I'm just
going to use this as my bronzer and just
taking it on the same big fluffy brush
for blush I'm going to be using the Too
Faced blush and Coco rose and it's just
a really nice neutral color I'm just
going to take a little bit on this edge
cosmetics blush brush and put that on my
cheeks the next thing I'm going to be
doing is highlight and I think that
highlighting is so important for prom
because it just looks so good in
pictures so today I'm going to be using
the Becca highlight and opal and I'm
actually going to be using this with my
Beauty Blender because I think it just
gives a really really nice natural
highlight to your face so I'm just
taking a little bit of that and putting
it right on top of my cheekbones so I've
already primed my eyes with the NARS Pro
prime smudge proof eyeshadow base and
that will just keep your eyeshadow on
all night long without creasing or like
rubbing off or anything and then today I
wanted to use more bronze tones because
I think
that will go with most dress colors so
today I'm going to be starting out with
this buxom cream eyeshadow and mutt and
this is just a really pretty bronzy
cream eyeshadow and it's perfect for
layering underneath your eyeshadow just
so it stays on longer and I'm just gonna
put that on my lids look how pretty that
is I would literally go to prom with
just crank it because I love this color
so much if you're somebody that doesn't
really like doing their eyeshadow or
their eye makeup but you still want to
do some eye makeup for prom then I would
highly recommend this buxom cream
eyeshadow it's so good and it just looks
like you spent so much time on your eye
makeup when really you didn't I'll have
everything linked below that I talked
about in this video in case you guys are
interested but for my next eyes shadow
I'm going to go in with Mac's
course and this is just a really nice
neutral brown color and I'm going to put
that in my crease now I'm just going to
take a little bit of max honey lust and
just put that all over the lid and honey
West is just a really pretty golden a
sparkly color and that's just going to
make our eyeshadow just pop a little bit
more my camera just stopped recording
but I'm taking the morphe m51 4 with Mac
espresso which is just a really nice
neutral dark brown color and I'm just
putting that in my crease just to darken
up never-fail stuff oh I'm just going to
use that to darken up the look a little
tiny bit
now I'm just going to take a matte white
shade and put that right underneath my
eyebrow just to brighten up the eyes a
little bit and now I'm just going to do
a classic winged eyeliner with my
favorite liquid eyeliner it's the
Physicians Formula eye booster and
hopefully I can film this for you guys
and focus and now I'm going to do my
eyelashes and I'm using the Koko lashes
and goddess today I just think that fake
eyelashes are perfect for prom because
they really take your look to the next
level the first thing I like to do
before I put on fake eyelashes is curl
my lashes and put on some mascara just
so my natural ones and the fake ones
blend together really easily so I left
the glue on the eyelashes get a little
bit tacky for about a minute and now I'm
just going to put them on with some
tweezers while I just let that glue dry
I'm going to take this same a buxom
cream eyeshadow and just run that
underneath my eye and then add some
mascara to the bottom today I'm going to
be using this Too Faced melted lipstick
and it just comes in a little squeezy
tube like this this actually lasts so
long on your lips that's why I'm going
to use it today umm but it's just a
really nice neutral pinky toned color so
let's see how this looks and just make
this lip last all night I'm going to use
this matte lip liner in world so this is
what the makeup looks like I actually
really like how it turned out I love
these eyelashes so much and really you
can pair this makeup look with any
different lip color that you want but
yeah I hope that you guys like it and if
you do recreate this look for your prom
or even if you don't recreate this for
your prom please send me pictures
because I would love to see pictures of
you guys at prom so
be them on Instagram snapchat Twitter I
love them all
I love you guys have a great rest of
your day and I will see you very soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
