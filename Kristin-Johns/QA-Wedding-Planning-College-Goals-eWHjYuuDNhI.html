video for you I've been out of America
for the past month month and a half
feels like two months I've been gone
I've been traveling all over Europe I
went to see my sister in Denmark we went
to France Italy Switzerland we've been
all over the place and a ton of stuff
happened in last month first of all I
got engaged and I'm so excited and also
my channel has grown a lot so I figured
the perfect next video to do would be a
Q&amp;amp;A so I asked you guys on Instagram to
leave me some questions and also on
snapchats leave me some questions so
let's just get started a so I figured to
start I should just answer questions
about the proposal the wedding
everything like that because that is
like most of the questions that I got is
all about my wedding what it's going to
be like when is it going to be so truth
be told I haven't even started planning
my wedding but we're probably going to
get married sometime in March that's not
definite yet but sometime in March
probably um but other than that I have
no idea I don't know where it's going to
be I don't know the exact date it's
going to be so I have a lot of planning
to do for the wedding it's kind of
stressing me out
but I know I have a ton of people that
are going to help me so really gonna
rely all my friends and family the next
question that I got a lot is what is my
college major and what do I plan on
doing with it that's a really good
question I am still in college I still
have one more semester left at FSU so
I'm graduating in December which I'm
really excited about I'm studying media
communications right now
YouTube is my job which is amazing and
social media so I love that one day like
I've said before I would love to open a
non-profit do something to help kids and
people in poverty that's like my dream
so that's probably what I'm going to be
doing with my degree what is your
favorite fruit my favorite fruit changes
all the time
um I love fruit so much I think
everybody loves fruit um my favorite
fruit is probably watermelon or
blackberries I love watermelon and
blackberries what are you most excited
for about living as the married life oh
my gosh there's so many things that make
me so excited about being married I just
cannot wait to be married I'm so excited
to never have to do long-distance again
because we've been doing long-distance
for over two years and it sucks it
really stinks um but that's probably my
number one most excited thing is that I
don't have to do a long-distance anymore
second is I know that when I get married
I'm gonna get a dog I keep telling Marty
something like you know that we're gonna
get a dog like right away right
yes Kristin I know that has been your
favorite place to travel and what is
your favorite thing about traveling
traveling is my favorite thing ever as
you guys probably know me and Marcus
always take road trips
I am always wanting to go someplace new
um my favorite place uh my favorite
place I've ever been is probably Italy I
love Italy that's where we got engaged
so it's even more special to me now um
Italy or Switzerland have been my
favorite places to travel and my
favorite part about traveling is number
one trying the food and also just seeing
different beautiful places that I've
seen in pictures before and then just
seeing them in real life is just like
the coolest thing ever
what are your key go-to makeup products
Mikey go to makeup products mmm that's a
good one um I have been traveling like I
said over the past few months and I've
been losing makeup I have forgotten
makeup so I think I can confidently say
what are my three main products because
this is really just like what I've been
using it's like three different products
and I would say it's the benefit roller
lash mascara that's my favorite mascara
bronzor I've been using NARS Laguna and
I really like it and also just any kind
of lipstick or chapstick my favorite one
at the moment has just been good old
aqua for it's just a really hydrating
lip balm and those are my three key
makeup products what comes to your mind
every time you see your engagement ring
wow that's a good question I think that
the first thing that comes to my mind is
like I can never lose this I always am
so scared that I'm like feeling my rain
isn't there oh my gosh I would be so sad
if I ever lost it but I just think wow
I'm so happy that I get to spend the
rest of my life with my best friend
that's probably the first thing I think
of after please don't lose this I really
like this question somebody said what
are the little things you enjoy in life
and oh I love that question that's so
cute I love going to see movies I love
eating dessert I love petting animals I
love um cuddling with Marcus somebody
asked what's your favorite memory from
your childhood and that is really hard I
feel like I have the worst memory ever
so I can't remember things that well but
one thing that really sticks out in my
mind is when I lived in Louisiana with
my family when I was growing up we
always had a crawfish boils with our
whole family and they would just make
the best food we would eat like our body
weight in crawfish and if you're
southern girl or boy you know that
crawfish boils are like the best thing
ever somebody asks what is your most
embarrassing moment and I know this and
it's very embarrassing I was walking
through campus and I was wearing a dress
and I didn't realize it but my dress was
like tucked in to my backpack like this
was my back and my dress was like up
here because my backpack had grabbed
onto it so my whole butt was out and I
was walking across campus so it was like
that for probably 15 minutes and then
I put my hands like this and I was like
where's my dress because I could feel my
butt and I was like no and like super
quickly I just like pull it all down and
I ran to the bathroom I was like how
many people just saw my butt probably
hundreds and I was so embarrassed
that was horrible so since that time I
have never worn a dress to school again
because like I refuse to have that
happen again
that was horrible what is your biggest
goal for the future that's a really good
question - um I think that right now my
biggest goal for the future um as I keep
doing like YouTube and social media I
think my biggest goal is to just be a
positive influence because I feel like
there's so much negativity on the
internet it blows my mind how much hate
and sadness is on the Internet
so I think my biggest goal is to just be
a positive light and just to be somebody
that young girls and anybody can look up
to okay now I'm going to go over to
snapchat and see if any of you guys
asked me some questions if you could
live anywhere in the world where would
it be and why I love you she's so cute
um okay if I could live anywhere in the
world oh that's really hard because I
wouldn't want to live somewhere that's
not in America because then I'd be so
far away from my mom and dad and my
family and my friends but if I could
live anywhere in America it would
probably be somewhere in California so
that's good because I'm in California hi
Kristin I was wondering what your
favorite oh good question
my favorite high-end foundation would
probably have to be Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation I just started wearing
foundation like a little over a year ago
I think so
Too Faced Born This Way it would have to
be my
everyone that wedding dress you imagine
yourself wearing on your wedding day
oh that's a good question to you um what
style of wedding dress would I want to
wear on my wedding day um I think I want
to have long sleeves with the low back
with like some lace on it but I'm not
really sure I haven't even tried on any
wedding dresses so I needed to figure
that out I need to see what looks good
on me and then we'll see we'll see okay
she says when did you get your belly
button pierced
and are you naturally tan argh you use
any fake can so I got my belly button
pierced about two and a half years ago
maybe a little more than that maybe like
three years ago and I have no idea why I
got my belly button pierced
it was just like me and my friends were
sitting around one day on a Saturday and
I was so bored and we're just like let's
go get things pierced so I got my
bellybutton pierced and pretty sure I
had like a coupon that's why I did it
but I don't know I don't regret it but
I'm not like so happy that I did it it's
just really random that I have it my mom
freaked out she hates it so much so
sorry mom that you hate my bellybutton
ring she also asked do I fake tan or do
I naturally tan and I've never used a
fake Tanner before I actually have some
that I wanted to try by loving can but I
haven't used it yet because I'm too
scared that I'll really mess it up so
this is oh I'm not really tan right now
but any tan that you do see sometimes is
from the Sun which is bad I know okay
