bunch of crack and camphor and honey
earth fighting right next to my bed
right there so if you hear some of their
noises I don't know how to control them
hey hey everyone calm down
everyone this is the culprit of making
all those strange noises honey
honey you've been exposed so I'll start
with Twitter and the first question I
have here is did you ever think about
quitting school and I think that this
person meant college but yes I did think
about dropping out of college I actually
thought about it very seriously because
me and Marcus were long-distance and I
was already doing YouTube and I was
really tempted to just commit to doing
YouTube full-time and not getting my
degree in the end I decided that college
was important and I know education is
super important and I just wanted to
stick through it and graduate with my
degree so I did a graduate college but
it was very tempting to drop out let me
just say what's one quality you value
most in a person I would say this has
actually changed recently especially
since I've moved to Los Angeles but I
would say my number one thing that I
value the most in a person is their
genuineness and just them being true to
who they are and not putting on a show
trying to be someone else I feel like
that's really common to find not just in
LA but especially in LA and I just feel
like I really connect with people who
are just truly their self they're not
trying to put on an act and not trying
to act like the people that are around
them and I feel like I can really tell
when someone's being genuine so yeah
that's one thing that I love the most
about Marcus because he has been the
same since I met him too now he is who
he is and he doesn't try to be like
anyone else
I got variations of this question so
much so I definitely want to answer it
Tammy asks is it difficult to handle two
doggies now that honey is part of the
family I got so many questions like what
is it like
two dogs is it way harder or like how
are you dealing with it and I was
thinking about doing an entire dedicated
video to that but I'll just answered in
this video um I would actually say this
might sound crazy and I might just be
like a crazy dog lady but I feel like
having two dogs is actually easier than
just having one dog I know
call me crazy but I really do feel like
that obviously it takes up more of my
energy just because having two dogs like
bringing them somewhere it's like a
whole nother dog you have to bring and
put their leash on and bring more food
for them but I feel like in the house
since they can entertain each other I
don't feel as guilty if I'm working or
not spending time with them because they
have each other to hang out with and
play with
because they're constantly playing with
each other so I'm like oh good they're
getting like good exercise and they're
having fun and they're not just like
bored to death sitting in the house and
my friends asked me all the time like I
don't know should I get another dog and
I always just say yes because it really
has been so happy I haven't regretted
getting honey one second and I don't
know I was thinking before we got her I
was like we might get this dog and be
like what have we done so much extra
work but I feel like it's actually the
opposite I also got this question a lot
about YouTube so she said what's your
life like being paid on YouTube and how
do you stay financially stable any
second jobs YouTube is my only job and
was the question when I make sure that I
answer it correctly what is it like
being paid on YouTube so i actually have
mixed feelings about this because
sometimes it can be hard to balance
everything on YouTube especially when
making money from YouTube so the way
that I make my money on YouTube is
through working with brands that I love
and sharing them with you guys which
that's like the dream job it seriously
is but I think the hard part comes in
when people get annoyed at you for
promoting things and having sponsored
videos which I understand that a
sponsored video can be annoying like
not to throw shade or anything but like
if someone's like promoting best fiends
all the time or something that you can't
really relate to or just things that
you're like this person doing really
like that but 100% I only work with
actual companies that I've use and love
and would think that you guys would love
so sometimes it makes me sad when I see
comments and people like you're always
sponsored in your videos because I'm
like eh I always try to spread out my
sponsored videos and I try to make the
best content for you guys and try to
create a lot of content so that the
sponsored posts are balanced out with
not sponsored posts but also you guys
have to realize that that is the way
that I can make videos because if I
didn't do sponsored videos I couldn't
make videos for a living someone asked
what my last screen shot was so I
screenshot a bunch of questions so that
I'll do what I screenshot it before that
and it's this picture of me and camper I
screenshot at it because I wanted to
upload it onto my Instagram story and
you have to have it like in the last 24
hours to upload it so yeah I uploaded
that and I just look at this picture and
I just realized camper was always so
huge and his paws were always massive
and honey is just so petite compared to
him like her paws are a third of the
size that campers were when we got him
so I just feel like she's gonna be so
much smaller than him okay now I'm gonna
move on to Instagram questions although
I just got this new phone case and I've
gotten already like five people telling
me that it's really creepy but I just
thought it was cute I got it off Amazon
it was like five dollars is this creepy
I don't know I just thought it was cute
but maybe it is creepy so I'm gonna
asked what is the strangest talent that
you have and I thought this was a great
opportunity for me to share this really
special talent that I have with you guys
it's pretty much just the fact that I
can move every part of my face so I can
move my ears let me show you can move my
eyebrows I can move my nose
I can't really do anything special with
my lips is this special well that's it I
can only do it to one side so that's my
special talent I can individually move
parts of my face what is the most
romantic thing Markus has ever done for
you hands down the most romantic thing
beside like the proposal because that's
obviously the most romantic but the most
romantic just random thing he's ever
done for me is it was when we were doing
long-distance so I lived in Florida
still and I flew out to LA to see him
for Valentine's Day and I got up into
his apartment and the whole room was
just covered in rose petals
he had cooked a dinner there was wine
and there was balloons everywhere
flowers everywhere and it was just like
wait what the heck Marcos like he had
never done anything like that before I'm
pretty sure I have pictures and videos
if I can find them I'll insert them into
this video but it was just the sweetest
thing ever and he wrote me the kindest
car and I think that the reason it was
so romantic is because I just was not
expecting it at all like I was so caught
off guard and I was just like what the
heck this is like a movie or something
this question is funny but also sad and
also relatable does pregnancy scare you
I'm honestly terrified of getting
pregnant when I'm older it seems so
gross well I don't think pregnancy seems
gross to me but I really do have a fear
of not being pregnant necessarily but
having a baby I just feel like it will
be so painful and I just have so much
respect for all the women that have ever
given birth because I just I guess when
the time comes it's like okay this is
happening like you don't really have a
choice you gotta push the baby out but
I'm just so scared for that moment maybe
as I get mature and become more of a
woman I'll be less scared but as of
right now I am terrified terrified of
having a baby not even having the baby
just pushing out the baby
that is what I'm so nervous about what
are your tips for making a house become
a home you know what I think makes a
house a home a dog I know that's dumb
but I really do feel like Cambron honey
just like make this house feels so homey
but other than a dog like I'm not saying
you all have to get a dog I just think
like slowly getting things that have
meaning to you and things that are
special to you make a house a home and
having people over having like game
nights and cook dinner for people I
think those are things that make a house
to go homey also pictures of your family
makes the house homey which I am
definitely lacking I have a few in the
living room but I want to get more
pictures printed because I feel like
that is really something that makes your
house have like that real personal touch
to it do you feel like it's hard for you
to share your faith on social media I
actually don't feel like sharing my
faith on YouTube and social media is
that difficult for me just because since
I feel like I have been sharing it since
the beginning of my time on social media
I feel like you guys also like a lot of
you guys have strong faith as well so I
feel like you guys can relate to that
and you like hearing about my faith and
I obviously have people that watch my
videos that aren't religious or they're
a different religion but I feel like I
don't know I feel just really lucky
because all of my subscribers all my
followers just are really nice and you
guys are just very accepting and you
want to hear what I have to say from my
heart and I just feel like no one really
gets mad at me when I share my face I
mean I'll get one or two comments but
that's not gonna stop me from sharing
like the biggest part of my life okay
guys that is it for today's video I
really hope that you enjoyed it and I
hope that I answered a bunch of
questions and thank you for sending me
in questions because that
it's time and I really do appreciate it
