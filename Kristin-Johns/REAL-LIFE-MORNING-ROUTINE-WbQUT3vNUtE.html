don't think I've ever videoed this early
in the morning like right when I wake up
but the reason I'm doing this is because
I want to vlog my morning so I'm gonna
be Kiki I've never be taking you through
my actual morning routine
what I do every single morning so this
is what I deal with every morning this
whiny dog so basically our alarm clock
every single morning is honeybee because
she has to go the bathroom really early
and the next thing to do is get some
breakfast he went to breakfast
I wanted to do a vlog style morning
routine just so that you can really
actually get a depiction of what I do in
the morning instead of kind of like
setting it up and doing it it's like a
nice video so I just feel like a vlog
would be like the most authentic way for
you guys to come with me and my morning
the next thing I do this is actually
kind of teaching me what I actually do
in the morning I open the blinds to our
front of our house every single morning
and this is like the happiest part of my
routine I don't know why I just get to
see what the weather's like and it just
makes our house so much brighter so this
is something I just love doing so I
actually don't eat breakfast right when
I wake up cuz I'm just not very hungry
so I usually just put on a tiny bit of
makeup if I know I'm going somewhere I'm
just gonna be using the ultra Repair
tinted moisturizer SPF 30 I've talked
about this a ton on my channel by now
and it's because it's my favorite
lightweight natural looking product to
put on my face so I like to use this
like every single day when I'm not going
somewhere that I need super full
coverage and the thing that I love about
this is that throughout the day it just
keeps looking good because it is so
moisturizing
that it doesn't flake off it doesn't
make your skin look cakey and it almost
doesn't even look like I have on makeup
but it just makes my skin more even and
hydrated and I'm just going to use a
tiny bit of concealer underneath my eyes
where I just want to look more awake I
am NOT very awake right now
and if my mom taught me a trick I'm not
actually doing it right now she taught
me to always use this finger to put in
your concealer I'm actually using my
middle finger right now but I should be
using this one because this is like your
most gentle finger and under your eyes
you need to be gentle and I'm just gonna
set my under eyes so they don't crease
but I'm not gonna set the rest of my
face so that it stays
Chloe is the tart chapstick in nude I
love these things because they're so
sheer but really shiny I'm debating on
whether to put on mascara or not I know
sometimes you just do not feel like
putting on mascara I'm just gonna I'm
gonna put on a tiny bit even when you're
wearing the tiniest amount of makeup
I feel like mascara really pulls you all
together I wanted to show you my pajamas
because I actually got these from the
maternity section of ASOS and then my
sweater is from Free People and this is
just the comfy sweater ever kind of
looks like I'm supposed to be
Valentine's Day girl but it's not
Valentine's Day but I think I want to
wear a dress today
and I want to stick to like the light
area I think I kind of want to wear this
because I have never worn this before
let's see I haven't tried it on yet it's
from the brand McGuire and let's see
what it looks like here's what the dress
looks like I think this dress is really
cute this is my little box not box
basket of favorite essential oils so I
just take this over here and I have to
step on this stool since it is on this
ledge it's a dangerous ordeal and I just
lift up the top pour some water in okay
these are the ones I'm going to use
today eucalyptus lemon peppermint in
bergamot and after I fill it up I just
turned it on and it has actually plays a
song but Marcus really hates the song so
I turn that off and then I put it on for
three hours okay so to make my breakfast
again I do the exact same thing every
single morning I'm not
oh I use this Trader Joe's 0% a nonfat
plain Greek yogurt so I just put
probably like a half of a cup of this in
my bowl and then I put in holy dark not
semi-sweet fully dark chocolate
chocolate chips and a little tip I've
never told you guys is to keep your
chocolate chips in the refrigerator and
then they're just so much better because
they're like more crunchy and then I
also add honey which is a very important
step and the last thing is gia seeds I
usually put granola and coconut flakes
in it but and usually if Marcus is still
asleep I eat my breakfast and then kind
of like plan out my day what I'm gonna
do if we do not do this our house turns
into basically a tumbleweed destination
for dog hair so I do this every morning
and then I also vacuum every morning a
lot of you asked how I deal with the dog
hair in my house and this is exactly how
I'm going to show you how much hair has
built up in this one room and I swept
like yesterday afternoon and this is how
much hair like you would think I hadn't
swept in a month it's kind of weird in
this year because usually when I'm like
vlog style videoing I usually go
throughout my whole day but since this
is just a morning routine I guess I have
to end it here so sorry Marcus wasn't in
this video he's still sleeping so I
don't want to wake him up but usually we
spend our mornings together so I also
brush my teeth right when I wake up but
I forgot to show you guys that I know
I'm probably gonna get so many comments
saying do you brush your teeth if you
liked this vlog style routine type video
give it a thumbs up and maybe I'll do a
nighttime one if you guys would want to
see that and don't forget to subscribe
to my channel if you want to see it new
videos every single week and I love you
and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
