video idea ah I'm just really excited to
fill this I've been looking forward to
this video ever since I got this product
let me just explain what my idea behind
this video is so I got this palette from
Sephora this is the Anastasia
lip palette this is actually limited
edition but it comes with a ton of
different lip shades in here that you
can mix yourself to create basically any
lipstick shades that you would ever want
in your whole life but when I saw this I
was like I have to try that but I was a
little bit nervous because I was like I
don't know it's the formula oh because I
didn't know if the formula of the actual
little squares would be a good lipstick
formula and I've actually been trying
this a lot as you can tell I've been
really really playing with it but I love
the texture in the formula of these lip
products so my idea for today's video
was that I'm going to take some of my
favorite lipstick shades I have them
right here and I'm going to try to
create shades that are the exact same
and create my own dupe of popular
lipstick this palette is $48 and if I
can create shades that are exactly the
same as all of these why even have to
buy a single lipstick when you can
create the lipstick that you want
exactly so when you buy this palette you
get the lipsticks you get this little
mixing palette you can see here some of
the colors that I've mixed together just
playing around with it and you also get
a little spatula you can use this to
take out the colors and mix them
together and you also get a little lip
brush so I wanted it to do shades that I
wear a lot so I got my core main
lipsticks that I tend to wear on a
day-to-day basis I also maybe at the end
of this video will try to create some
different like funky colors that I
wouldn't normally wear just to show you
all of the different range of colors you
can kind of do so for this video I I
don't know which one to start with okay
I think I'm
start with my all-time holy grail
lipstick which is Mac's cream in your
coffee if you guys have been watching my
channel for a long time I think in my
first ever makeup video I showed you
guys me wearing this lipstick I've been
wearing this lipstick for so Waldo cream
in your coffee is kind of more of a
brown tone kind of rosy mauve color so
I'm going to scoop off a little bit of
this one on to my palette so I can have
kind of something to compare the shade
that I'm mixing with so I took my little
spatula I'm just going to put a little
bit on there okay for this one I think
I'm going to first go in with this rosy
multi color it's a little bit too berry
tone to be exactly like cream in your
coffee but this is just going to be my
base color so I think I'm going to pick
up a tiny bit of the color that was next
to the first one we tried this one it's
a little bit of a deeper red color I'm
going to take a tiny bit back and mix
that in and see if that helps it's still
a tiny bit darker than creaming your
coffee so I'm going to take some of the
white shade just to lighten it up now
that I added the white shade in there I
really think that I got a very very
close match really the only difference
is that the custom shade the formula is
a little bit more math and cream in your
coffee okay so here are the two shades
you can see this is the one that I mix
together and this is the one that is the
math shade now I'm going to do the other
half with my custom my custom blend
think of the main difference is this one
is just more sheer and glossy but I
think that the shade is very very close
with you guys think do you think that
they're a very close match I would give
this one a 9 out of 10 because if the
formula wasn't different and maybe my
custom one was a little bit lighter I
think it would be a very very exact dupe
the next shade that I want to try to
recreate is Kylie cosmetics ginger
liquid lipstick this is one of my
favorite colors I wear the shade all the
time it's a really pretty like terra
cotta brown nude shade so I'm going to
put that on my palette I hope that I can
do this one because if I don't have to
buy this anymore
I'll be very happy because this stuff is
not cheap okay
I'm really excited it's like a challenge
and an experiment all of them so first
I'm going to go in with this oranges
shade it's like a deep rest orange color
some of that on my palate as my main
base and then I'm going to grab some of
this like warm deep brown color and add
that in coming together already so these
are the colors I have right now that's
Kylie's ginger and that is my custom
color I feel like they're pretty spot-on
but I'm going to put them on and we'll
see what they would like
so first I'm applying Kylie's ginger and
on the other side I'm going to be
putting my version of ginger hopefully
it's the same I'm getting really
competitive myself okay
okay so here is how the two lipsticks
can pair on my lips I feel like my
version is maybe a tiny bit lighter but
I feel like overall they're very very
similar so for that one I literally just
had to mix two shades together so that
one's super easy to recreate which is
amazing this is actually working a
little bit better than I thought it was
like looking in the mirror I wouldn't be
able to tell that I'm wearing two
different lip colors and that's kind of
an
because I made the color myself I would
actually give this one probably a nine
and a half out of ten because I know
it's not exactly this one is a little
bit lighter but man they're close
okay the next shade that I'm going to be
trying to recreate is Too Faced melted
matte lipstick and this is in the shade
cool girl I feel like this one might be
a little bit harder to recreate because
I don't know I just feel like it's going
to be tricky I think for the base of
cool girl 2.0 I'm going to use this
shade because it just seems like the
most similar nude in the palette I'm
going to grab a little bit of white like
only a tiny bit because I think it's
just a little bit lighter than what I
have now and then I'm just going to add
a tiny bit of the yellow and so here's
the final product I'm going with I think
there's just something missing
I feel like there's a little bit of gray
and the cool girl shade that I just
can't exactly match but we'll have to
see what it looks like on the lips I'm
nervous about this one I don't think I
did it as good as the other ones but
we'll see okay so that's this is the
original and I'm going to see if our
creation cool girl 2.0 is similar
yeah this looks good okay actually cool
girl ended up drying a little bit darker
than it looked wet on my little palette
so it kind of was a tricky one it trick
stirred me into shrinking it was
something different than it was
so that means my shade turned out a
little bit lighter than it actually was
supposed to be I would give this one an
8 but I definitely wouldn't say that
it's a horrible dupe I would say that
it's an eight an eight out of ten dupe
what names I think it last one that I'm
going to try I wanted to try a little
bit of a different type of color so I
wanted to try a red color and I have
another Kylie cosmetics liquid lipstick
and this one is in the shade Mary Jo kay
this one is a very unique red color
though because I feel like it has some
like fuchsia undertones but it's still
like a very pretty true red color so I
have my work cut out for me so for this
one the obvious base choice is this red
that comes in the palette so I'm going
to put that down okay
so I think I just made a huge mistake I
added too much blue and now I have like
a dark purple lipstick so I'm going to
scratch that and try and try okay so
there's my mess-up one in the middle and
I made the big mistake of adding way too
much blue but this is the shade that I
have now and all I did to get this shade
was I mixed together this red this and a
tiny bit of this fuchsia color and I got
this and I think that that looks pretty
similar so let's try that on the lip
this one could be the best one yet
it also could be the worst one yet
because liquid lipstick does tend to dry
a little bit of a different color okay
so I'm going to be applying Mary Jo Kay
to this side Mary Jo Kay 2.0 on the
other side here are the two lipsticks
compared I think that mine turned out a
teeny tiny bit lighter but I think that
this is a good one I think this one
turned out really good I think that this
lipstick palette is one of my favorite
makeup investments that I've ever made
it because you can create so many
different lipsticks shades and you don't
have to try to dupe other lipstick
shades you can just run wild with your
imagination and make any lipstick shade
that you want which i think is so cool
so the last little bonus cards this
video that I want to try is I want to
try to create a lipstick shade that I
would never necessarily buy myself but
it's just like a fun color experiment so
I already mixed a really pretty blue
color on this palette a while ago I
actually snapchatted be wearing it but I
think today I'm going to try to make a
green lipstick like a pastel green
lipstick because I know I would never
buy that but it's just fun to see what
it looks like
so to make my green shade I am going to
be mixing together the blue that comes
in here with the yellow because with the
walls colors blue and yellow make green
okay so I got a very dark emerald green
color but that's not what I'm going for
and going for the pastel look so I'm
going to add some white in there and see
if that helps out my case because right
now it's not looking to you so this
isn't necessarily the color I had in my
brain but also it's not color I've ever
seen in Sephora so might as well try it
on see what it looks like because I
definitely wouldn't buy this in a store
so this is the color that I have mixed
together it's a very um mossy green
color I'll name it Moss and if I ever
come out with a makeup line I'll include
Moss just in case any of you out there
want to buy him he will be available
okay so here is my creation it looks
like I kind of got an ammonia a little
bit but it didn't really get fair shots
my lips were so stained so it kind of
looks like
wearing green lipstick with the red
lipliner and that's just not cute but
the main point was just to show you guys
that you can literally make any color
with this lip palette which I just think
it's so much fun and it makes you feel
like a little artist mixing on your
palate and I just can't say enough good
things about this palette it's not
sponsored at all I bought this with my
own money
from Sephora I just really wanted to
show you guys a really cool new beauty
product I know that this video was a
little bit different but I really do
hope that you enjoyed it and if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
for new videos every single week but I
love you guys so much and I hope that
you have a great rest here day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
