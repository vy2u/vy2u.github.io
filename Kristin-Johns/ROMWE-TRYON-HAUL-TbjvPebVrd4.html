filming a video today but that's because
I was not expecting this package to come
in the mail I ordered some stuff from
the site called romli I didn't expect it
to come in for like a month because this
is a Chinese website so it's coming from
China I have some backstory on this
company because you know all of those
websites like Chien saffle Bromley all
those different types of very cheap
clothing websites but cute clothes it
looks like cute clothes online I ordered
from one of them when I was a senior in
college so it was probably like a year
ago and my order never came and I had
ordered like $300 worth of stuff because
I wanted to do a YouTube video about it
and it was this whole huge ordeal where
they basically said they couldn't do
anything about it the package got lost
somehow and I was basically just out of
300 something dollars and I couldn't
figure out which one it was because I
looked back in my old emails and I
couldn't find the emails so I don't know
but it was one of these three sites that
happened to me so I was nervous about
this but I've been seeing these videos
and they're so intriguing to me people
trying on these very cheap clothes and
some ended up being amazing some end up
being horrible so I wanted to test it
out for myself because I just am very
intrigued by it so I ordered a bunch of
stuff I have my little order thing right
here I ordered two hundred and forty-one
dollars worth of clothing items from
romwe romli I don't know and it came it
came so fast guys it came in like a week
I was shocked what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna show you guys the clothes and then
I'm gonna try it on and while I'm try it
on I'll tell you how it fits and
everything like that so let's just get
started because I have a lot of stuff
here so the first thing in here is this
little striped shirt it feels like
pretty good quality this shirt was $10
so pretty cheap and I just thought the
colors of it were really cute paired
with
jeans or high-waisted shorts tucked in
and I mean this this was a pretty safe
bet it's just a little t-shirt but we'll
see how it looks on okay so here is what
the first t-shirt looks like I feel like
this one is good quality it feels nice I
think it would be cuter tied up so let's
see so this is what it looks like tied I
think it looks way cuter tied like this
and I mean for a really cheap t-shirt I
feel like this is cute okay I tried to
play it safe because I was nervous about
the more risky items like being bad
quality but I did also get some things
that I don't know I was like nervous
about but I wanted to get them because I
knew I was gonna be doing this video so
I don't know this is one of the items
that's kind of nervous about so this is
called the heart cutout ribbed tee I got
this for eight dollars and 40 cents and
I don't know if you can see it but in
the front there's a little heart cut out
like it says this looks really cute
online but I didn't know if it would be
really weird once you put it on like if
the heart stretches out or something so
we'll see how this is and I also really
like the little scalloped edges or
ribbed edges
I'm actually really pleasantly surprised
with this one this one fits really cute
the heart doesn't really get stretched
out which is what I was most afraid of
and the sleeves are cute
it doesn't fit weird at all it fits
pretty normal like a fitted t-shirt and
I like it I will definitely wear this I
think it's kind of like super 90s this
next thing ooh this one feels kind of
this was only ten dollars this looks
very cute online and it actually looks
pretty cute in person this leather patch
is a little bit more shiny than I
expected but this looks really cute and
I mean you can't go super wrong with a
sweater right well this one actually
fits kind of weird the sleeves are just
too short
it just isn't cute I guess you could
wear it like this and it'd be a little
bit cuter I don't know
I just don't love this one very much I
think the sleeves just need to be longer
for it to fit cutely this is something I
was nervous about I was like I had as my
cart and then I took it out of my cart
and then I put it back in my cart
because I was so nervous about it
this is a two-piece set and this was $14
and this is weight well I guess Sheen or
she in and Romney are the same company
because this says she in because I
definitely ordered from wrong way so
there's that but they're just these
little shorts and this top and they look
really cute online okay here's what the
striped set looks like I think it looks
really cute um I don't really have any
negatives to say about it I mean the
butt isn't the most flattering but
usually these kind of shorts don't get
you the most flattering what area but I
think this is so cute especially for
like a beach day or something like that
it was actually I think this was the
most expensive thing that I got in this
whole order this was nineteen dollars
and 20 cents
this looks a little bit cheap but it
could also be one of those dresses
that's just very like loose and free and
looks cute on so we'll see this is the
first thing that I don't really like I
just don't like the way that it fits if
you can see on the sides there's like a
ton of extra material this one is
probably a thumbs down for me it's just
not the cutest okay this next thing is
funny because you guys have to tell me
have you seen this sweatshirt all over
Pinterest for like the past two years
because I have and then when I saw it on
Romney on the website I was like I just
have to get this sweatshirt to see if
it's like like what it's all about like
why is this sweatshirt all over
Pinterest this was $14.40
it's kind of like really not stretchy
like usually gonna have sweatshirt
very stretchy this has like no stretch
to it
it says berries orange hand-picked
Florida here is the sweatshirt I have
been waiting for I mean it is fine it's
fine
like I don't hate it I wish I could have
ordered it in a bigger size but again it
was one size fits all so I couldn't do
that it's just a weird uncomfortable
material since it's not stretchy it just
fits kind of yeah but I mean it's not
horrible at all and it is really soft on
the inside I think I will wear this but
I don't know oh this one came a little
bit like pooping off the package so this
is the only swimsuit that I got I'm
probably not gonna try it on for the
camera because I don't know I just feel
weird wearing my swimsuit on YouTube
is that dumb I don't know but this is
what it looks like it looks really cute
I love the color and the back of it is
super cute oh I didn't tell you how much
was this one was $14 the bottoms oh oh
dang the bottoms are so small like it's
gonna be like major thong situation
going on so maybe I can wear the top
with some different bottoms okay but
this is just a little t-shirt this was
only eight dollars I think that is a
steal one thing I will say about all
these clothes is they don't feel like
the softest like you know how brandy
melville t-shirts are like so comfy
these just feel a little bit more
crunchy you know what I'm saying that's
a cute little detail how the pocket is
tilted like that I like that that's
really cute I mean it's a pretty easy
thing for t-shirts to look good so but
this is a really cute t-shirt I like it
I love the colors I like the fit and
style of it I seriously live in t-shirts
so that's why I got so many oh another
t-shirt
this is what I was like really playing
it safe when I first went on but when I
first went off the website I was like
I'm just gonna get a bunch of t-shirts
and sweatshirts okay this one is a
little bit uglier than I thought okay so
this is $8.99 it's just a pink t-shirt
this one is actually really soft this is
the softest t-shirt yet um it just looks
kind of cheap like the logo looks kind
of cheap
it says simplicity is beauty and it has
a little flower on it okay that's what
it looks like up close I mean it's cute
you know this thing that is a little
little like cheesy I actually think that
this shirt is cute it fits really nice I
like the length of the sleeves and it's
like an easy comfy t-shirt it's a really
really soft material unlike some of the
other clothes oh I think I'm gonna like
this okay so this is a shirt and it was
1280 it looks like this it's a really
really cute shape I love these like low
sleeves and a little button up with the
pockets I think this could be adorable
here's what this one looks like I think
this one's adorable um I love the way
that it fits I feel like I can get so
much use out of this shirt also I feel
like this is the type of shirt that they
sell at Zara
for like $35 so I think that this was a
really good price for a shirt like this
I wonder if you can tie it yeah you
could tie it but I actually think I like
it better untied well I don't know what
do you guys think I also got this little
like workout pajama set this was $12 it
looked so cute online and then it comes
with this cami this looks a little bit
baby for me but maybe it'll work
here is the workout set the top actually
does fit dude I thought it was gonna be
too big but it fits pretty perfectly oh
this shirt smells like water balloons
like exactly like watermelon
this shirt was seven dollars and sixty
cents total steal it's one of those
shirts that has ruffles on the top
bottom and sleeves and they just look
really cute on I think a lot of
companies are making these so I just
wanted to try one out see what it looks
like okay I don't really think that I
like this one it just doesn't fit right
feel so restricting um ya know it just
looks kind of cheap like I don't think
you can tell but the cut along the
bottom is like going down then also you
don't even get the scalloping detail at
the top because it's so tight so it
should be like all ruffled like that but
it's just like stuff like that got
another sweatshirt and I got this inside
media did I yeah I guess I did get this
in the size medium
this one was 10 dollars and 99 cents
it's very soft I think this is really
cute is what this one looks like the
arms again I'm still having that problem
of the arms just being way too short I
still like this and I like the little
peach drink on it I think it's cute um
but yeah I like this this is pretty good
I would say I would definitely wear this
again oh I got another pair of workout
like it these were $14.80 I got them in
a size small but they look nice we'll
see how they fit on because sometimes
leggings can fit really weird probably
isn't the best angle but this is what
the leggings look like I think that
they're cute they fit really nicely they
feel soft
I like how high-waisted they are I think
that's cute
I just realized that four of the things
that I ordered that were actually very
cute they were all dresses oh and one
skirt didn't come so when they do come
in I will show you guys over on my
Instagram so you can see how those look
my Instagram is at Kristin Lauria and
I'll do that on like my Instagram story
or something so you guys can see because
I don't have a four of the things that I
ordered okay
this is the
first thing that feels really really
cheap and it was six dollars and forty
cents first of all this looks massive
and I got a size small it just looks
really big maybe it's not I don't know
it just looks big with like all of this
embellishment I guess I mean it's not
the worst but it's not the best so it's
actually really really excited about
this shirt it looked so cute online this
was seven dollars and sixty cents I feel
like this would be really cute on it
would just fit loose and comfy this
shirt is really similar to that other
white shirt that I got it just has the
peach stripes on it um but I love this
one as well I think it's adorable it's
super lightweight and comfy I feel like
it would go with everything
it's just like my kind of shirt you know
what I'm saying this and the white shirt
are probably two of my favorite things
that I got because I just know that I'm
gonna wear them a ton and when I wear
them you'll know it's from wrongly I
think this is my least favorite thing
that I got this color though this is
what I'm talking about it's like this
mustard yellow color I mean it doesn't
look that bad on camera but just in
person it just looks very cheap and not
very cute this was nine dollars and 20
cents one size and it's very weird
because all of these items come with a
different label on them some of them are
just straight Chinese some of them say
XI in some of them say wrong way some of
them have no logo and then this one says
sunflower so I don't know about that
it's not my favorite thing that I got
but it's definitely not horrible um
overall I would say that I'm very very
impressed with the things that I got I'm
kind of sad my other four things didn't
come in because they were really cute
looking um but I really actually very
impressed there was nothing that I
bought that was horrible except for this
this was horrible okay guys I really
hope that you enjoyed this video if you
did
give it a thumbs up I kind of want to
start doing more videos like this like
trying clothes from these different
websites that seem sketchy so I can try
them out and share them with you to see
maybe what items are good from the site
that you should order and which ones you
should stay away from and don't forget
to subscribe to my channel for new
videos every single week I love you guys
so much and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
