a very requested video I'm going to be
filming a room tour so I'm going to show
you all around my room and I will tell
you where everything is from if I can
remember and I'll just let you know all
my rule tips for organization and little
decorations that I've made so I hope
this video gives you guys some ideas or
some inspiration um don't forget
subscribe and like this video if you do
like it and let's get fed ok so before I
start I will just give you a little
overview of my room so this is what it
looks like right when you walk in the
door pretty small but it actually feels
very open since I decorated it with a
very light colors but I'll just start
right over here and this is where I keep
all of my clothes in my little dresser
you got these drawers at IKEA and
they're perfect they hold a bunch of
stuff like in this drawer I have my
jeans and then in here I have like more
of my workout stuff so I really like
these dressers they're pretty sturdy and
they hold a lot of stuff well on top of
here I have this little this little I
don't really know what you would call it
it's like a little Bowl and then I have
a little candle in there and then over
here I have this little frame that I've
had forever it's actually cracked
because I dropped it but it's from
rolled market and there's a little
picture of me and Marcus and then I just
have some dried flowers and then on top
of it I have this little thing and I
actually made this but I love this thing
because it takes up a lot of space so if
you have a very empty wall that you
don't really know what to do with I
think that this is a very good and easy
decoration to make yourself and then
when you walk over here I have this
mirror this mirror is from home good and
then over here I have my little calendar
that I love so much this is from Amazon
and it has all different types of like
foods for every month it's called like
the farmers market calendar so I love
that I think that's very cute and then
over here I have
my desk and my desk is from ikea and
I've had this for a very long time I
love this desk a lot it holds so much
hand the first thing I have is this
little eucalyptus plant that I've had
forever it's dried and it just stays
looking good dry for so long I have this
candle that's from Anthropologie it's
the best smell ever it smells so good
then I have this little artiste brush
that just looks really cute because it
kind of goes with everything and then I
have my little Jill Malone perfume that
I like to wear every day this is the
nectarine blossom and honey it smells
very very good so that's that little
corner I love this little space of my
desk and then over here I just have this
mirror that I had in my old room and I
use it every day to be my makeup I love
it so much it's by the brand Conair um
but I know it was my mom's and she got
it so long ago so they probably still
make them now and then over here I have
where I keep my makeup brushes it's this
little thing that I got from bells
outlet and it was supposed to be an herb
garden but I just put my brushes in
these little mason jars and then over
here on this window seat I have this
little pillow that my friend got me
that's from Etsy and if I can find it on
there I'll link it down below but I
think it looks really cute over there on
the little window seat so that is the
overview of the top of my desk and then
once I come in here this is where I keep
all of my makeup so I won't go through
all that right now because there's a lot
but I keep it in that little drawer from
the Container Store and then I just have
my palettes and then some other random
stuff and then over here I have the same
kind of thing I just keep some makeups
and make bags and more make a print in
this drawer I just keep more of my
everyday makeup and I just keep some
like rings and jewelry my beauty
blenders and this is like the stuff that
it used everyday so that's what I keep
it there and then I got this chair at a
thrift store it's just very cute I like
how it's like very simple and small it
doesn't take up there
trim so that is a little overview of my
desk where I get ready every morning and
do my makeup over here is this little
box that I actually got from a vintage
store and I keep my nail polishes in
here so you can open it up and here is
all my nail polishes I have way too many
and then up here I have this little
shadow box this is from Anthropologie
and I just watercolor this and put a
little bow in it and then a tiny little
mirror so here is my closet and then
right next to it I have this which I've
gotten a ton of comments about I
actually made this little picture hangy
thing the tree branch is from Michael
you can buy that pretty much at any
craft store and then I just took some
okay it's like the same thing but I just
took some twine and some mini little one
of these called
clothespin and then just hung some
pictures from them I think it looks
really cute and again if you have a ton
of space to fill I feel like this is a
perfect little decoration that's really
easy to make and it looks really cute
like it looks like personalized and it
can add a litte color and it just like
something unique that you can add your
room and then over here I have my little
bedside table my bedside table is from
Ikea and then I just keep some like old
vintage ebooks with a little candle and
a pinecone and then my Amazon echo that
I always listen to music and stuff on I
like to keep this little journal on top
of it and then I keep some dried
lavender even those little Sciences
basil I just put that in the next I
thought it was cute and then I have this
lamp which is the best part of my room
because watch this when you tap it it
gets brighter brighter and off I just
want that so much so I love that lamp I
got that at a thrift store and then in
this little drawer I keep a bunch of
different stuff I keep my chapstick that
I always use before bed I keep some nail
clippers some headphones some more
chapstick
equip some Polaroids
I love taking Polaroids I have so many
that I don't even know what to do with I
have one of me and Marcus and I have one
of me and piglet so I love Polaroids and
I just like to keep them in this little
drawer because I like to keep looking at
them but I don't really have a specific
place for them but yes that's mainly
what I keep in this little bedside table
and then under my bed I sneak Li keep
some things I like to keep my Bible and
my little devotions under here I also
have this little thing that I love so
much this is my little sketchbook that I
use to practice my calligraphy in so I
love sketchy in these before I go to
sleep
I just think that it's really fun then
let's move on to my bed which is pretty
much the last thing in my room you to
bowl hexagons shelves are from SD and
then I just decorated them with these
copper lights these are a gift I showed
you these in my last video but I think
they might be from t.j.maxx
I'm not 100% sure but I'll try to find
some similar and link them down below
and then I just have my little Polaroid
camera and a little cactus
and then over here I have a little book
that's just from a vintage store a
thrift store this candle from world
market and then some dry baby's breath
and then my bed frame is from Ikea and I
really like low bed frames because I
feel like they kind of look like they
take up less room because they're lower
to the ground I don't know that might
just be in my head but I always feel
like we'll Rebekah room look bigger and
then my bedspread is from Macy's I think
and then I have this little pillow
that's so cute it's this little gear and
my friend office for me from a store
called altered state and then last but
not least is this throw I mentioned this
in my last video because this was a
Christmas present for my mom it's from
Anthropologie it has some tassels up and
so comfy and soft and big and I just
love it so that's pretty much it for my
whole room I really hope you guys liked
it I'll give you a quick one last little
spin around of it all I'm going to be
really sad to move out of this room when
we move to LA because I love how bright
this room in and how simple it is but
I'll be decorating on me and Mike's
house very similar to this because I
just really like bright simple clean
feeling rooms you know what I'm saying I
really hope that you enjoyed this video
I hope that it maybe gave you some ideas
for some decorations or some crafts that
you can do at home but thank you guys

much
and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
