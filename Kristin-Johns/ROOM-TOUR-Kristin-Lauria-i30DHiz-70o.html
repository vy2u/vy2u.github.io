room tour video or a what's in my room
video whatever you want to call it a ton
of you guys have requested this video
and I'm really excited to do it for you
and I love you guys a whole lot and
thank you for watching and this is what
it looks like it's pretty tiny but I
think it's pretty good for a college
room and I guess I'll just go around and
tell you guys where I got certain things
how I decorated and all that stuff this
is my desk where I do my makeup and
where I should do my homework but I
usually just do it in my bed and this
desk is from ikea and this chair i
actually got from a thrift store got the
shudder from a thrift store for like $5
and then I have a little hanging plant
right here that's actually dead but I
still like the way that it looks and I
just hung that from my ceiling and right
here I have all my makeup brushes I just
keep them here so I can grab them really
fast and I keep them in little mason
jars and I put them in this little thing
supposed to be an herb garden but I use
it for my makeup brushes and I also hang
some of my necklaces from here and then
right here I have these containers from
the Container Store and I just hold my
makeup in there just some lipsticks and
powders and stuff like that if you guys
want to see an in-depth like makeup
collection or how I store my makeup I
will definitely do that for you guys so
just comment that down below but I also
have my Joe Milan perfume on here it's
the nectarine blossom and honey and it
smells so good and then just a cute
little deer that my friend got me a bow
and then I keep some of my jewelry here
just some watches and rings in here I
have just more makeup just
random makeup makeup this is like the
makeup and stuff that I use every single
day so I just have this is like my
little box of everyday makeup some rings
some blushes and this is where I keep my
eye makeup brushes and then in here I
have some jewelry some notepads and some
more makeup and like random journals and
stuff like that then I have this makeup
mirror I do my makeup in this mirror
literally every single day and I stole
it from my mom sorry mom I also have
this mirror which I really love I got
this one from a thrift store I also got
these shelves from a thrift store as
well as those old books and then I just
have some daisy perfume some dried
flowers and a picture of me Marcus and I
got this frame at Anthropologie moving
on to my bedside table so this is my
favorite candle ever it's from Target
it's the lavender and sage candle and
it's so good
and then I have my little sweet nothings
journal that I write my happy things of
the day in and then I have this lamp
that I got from Goodwill and this is one
of my favorite parts of my whole room
because watch how cool this is you can
just tap it and it turns on two
different levels of brightness and I
just love that lay up some more dried
flowers but those ones are fake and then
these curtains that I got from Kohl's I
think I think yeah I got them from
Kohl's
and then down here I have some books and
a candle and I just have a few Bibles
and journals and my iPad so that is what
I keep in my bedside table I don't even
want to look what's in the first drawer
because it's probably so messy here is
my bed I got all my pillows from
Goodwill as you can probably tell
they're kind of like dingy and old and
I'm going to get rid of this next year
but they were good for now and I got
this curtain from Goodwill and I just
hung some lights up there because I
think it looks pretty and it gives the
room a little bit more of like warm
light instead of
just the outside lights and I got this
really pretty like floral wreath at
Michael's it is my favorite thing ever I
got these two things from Anthropologie
and I water colored that little sign and
put it in there it's just like a little
shadow box and then I hung some
terrariums up here and I actually killed
this airplay at which how do you even
kill it air plant but it's definitely
dead I need to get a new one how do you
kill an air plant out now and then I
just put in this succulent because I
killed my other one on accident
definitely not on purpose but I do kill
things a lot plants that is not like
people and I just really like the way
that terrariums look they're super easy
to do so if you guys want me to do a
video on how I made these I definitely
will do that for you because they're
super easy and cute and I love them and
over on this wall I just have some more
lace curtains and then a little picture
that my roommate painted me and I loved
it so much over here I have this little
buffalo head that a lot of you might
recognize from my thirst or vlog and
then also I did that in one of my other
videos it was the homemade Christmas
gifts video so I showed you guys how to
wood burn and I thought we are giving
that to someone just because I made it
in a video so then I just put it in my
room and then I have some dried flowers
and this wooden thing is just from an
old like palette that I put there and
then some little tea lights and I have
these little picture frames that I got
from world market and that one I painted
says grace upon grace and then that's me
and Shannon and then I have my TV it
looks kind of funny because it looks
like it's wearing a hat and then this is
also from Ikea and I just have some of
i short sinned here and then I have some
workout clothes and t-shirts in here and
then over here this is the junk corner
hole not the junk but this is the corner
where I keep my stuff that I don't have
anywhere else to put so this is my
camera bag and then I just have a little
weight and a yoga mat and then I have
this little mirror hello and then over
here is my closet it just has some
curtains covering it because I guess the
people before us like took off the door
for some reasons yeah I just have some
extra organization down here for my
shoes and some more books and then some
more t-shirts and stuff but yeah that is
my whole closet I'm really OCD about my
hangers matching so I have all of these
black hangers hanging up all my clothes
and that is a really good tips for a lot
of you guys that feel like your closet
always looks messy if you get all the
same kind of hangers it really does help
and make it look way more organized and
at that little basket right there I have
all of my hair stuff so I have like
curling wands my hair dryer all the
stuff like that over here I have my
books for school let's just take a
moment and just say why why would I have
to read a book that is this horrible and
long and small look how small no one
should have to read a book about
literature theory it's just not right
and then on my door I just have my
backpack in my purse you know what's in
my purse if you saw on my what's in my
purse video and also a lot of you guys
we're asking where I got my backpack
because I post a picture on Instagram
and I got it from Amazon and I will link
it down below for you guys who are
interested so that is pretty much my
whole room hey guys I hope that you
