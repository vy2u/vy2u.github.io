you my September favorites who's with me
and thinking that September went by
extremely fast like abnormally fast
because ding but I'm so excited to be
showing you guys my monthly favourites I
need to get in the habit of doing these
every single month but I feel like if I
do them every few months then I have
some really good like new things to show
you guys I'm actually gonna start with
fashion favorites today I never start
with fashion but fashion deserves to be
first sometimes I got a ton of new pairs
of glasses from glasses usa.com these
are my old ones I just wanted to bring
them in to show you guys that's what
happens when you have a dog and he likes
to ruin things so I was basically in
dire need of some new glasses and
glasses usa.com really hooked me up they
gave me so many new pairs of glasses and
if you guys don't know what glasses
usa.com is basically it's an amazing
sight that you can shop for glasses
online but by cutting out the middleman
they can take the prices down up to 70%
of the retail price which is insane
because I feel like always when you go
into glasses stores glasses are just so
dang expensive so it's so nice that you
can shop online and get a great price
and also you don't even have to leave
your house I kind of wanted to show you
guys all of them I want an opinion on
which ones are your favorites
and another thing glasses USA has that
made it so easy for me to pick out which
ones that I liked is they have a virtual
Tryon option so you can upload a picture
of yourself and you can actually see
what the frames look like on your face I
mean that is genius that is seriously
genius cuz I would look at some hairs
and be like oh those would be so cute on
me and then I had virtually tried them
on I'd be like I'm so glad I didn't get
those so this is the first pair I got
there are these dainty little gold
frames and I love these I love the round
mists of them I think they're so
adorable and I know I have a ring light
so it might be a little bit hard to see
but this is what they look like on I
also got these which are different these
feel very lightweight and they
actually have kind of a matte satin
finish and these are tortoiseshell print
I love tortoiseshell glasses so I got
these I like the style of these just
classic simple I know I have my contacts
on underneath so when I put these on I
go blind so I can't really tell what I
look like in the viewfinder but
hopefully you can see what these look
like I also picked out this black pair
because these are the most similar to my
old frames that my old frames were just
black plain black and so I thought it
was just a safe bet and I feel like
every glasses wear needs a good staple
pair of black glasses and I saved my
favorite pair for last I love these
these are tortoiseshell but they're kind
of like a lighter tortoiseshell so they
kind of pop more and I just love the
style of these frames and I really
wanted to wear these glasses throughout
this whole video but since I have the
dang ring light I can't because it's
just too distracting so I love these so
much and I also got two pairs of
prescription sunglasses which I've never
had prescription sunglasses before so I
feel super legit now I got these black
aviators classic very nice sleek cute
the very last pair is the pair that I'm
like are you trying to be cooler than
you really are
because you might be trying a little bit
too hard but I still think that they're
really cool and I mean I just need to
gain some confidence to really pull
these off I feel like um like a
celebrity trying to hide their face from
the paparazzi just like without my
humongous glasses and just like no
pictures please
no pictures so if you guys wear glasses
and you're looking for a new pair I
would definitely recommend glasses

you're looking for a new pair of glasses

usa.com using the link in the top of my
description box my neck
favorite is right here it's these shoes
I think that I get more questions about
these shoes than anything else I've ever
worn these are from forever 21 their
little black loafers and I wear them
with everything I think the reason I get
so many questions about these is because
they look so nice they really look like
Gucci slides I don't know if you guys
have seen them I hadn't really seen them
before I got these but then I got three
different people asking me if these were
Gucci slides and then I was getting my
hair done one day and this lady came up
to me and she was like who makes your
shoes she was like very proper she's
like who makes your shoes and I was like
forever 21 and she was like oh I thought
they were like Chanel I was like nope
they were like $20 so people really get
fooled by these shoes and they think
that they're very expensive but they're
really not so that's great that's great
for me my other fashion favorite fashion
favorite is this letter from Free People
it doesn't look like anything special
hanging on the hanger but when you have
it on you can just wear it so many ways
like you can wear it off one shoulder
you can wear it off both shoulders you
can wear it regularly and it's just very
adorable on guys I think I've posted a
video when I was wearing this I think I
did oh yeah I was wearing this in my
decluttering vlog and a lot of you guys
really liked it but yeah I just love
this I think it's called like the best
friend sweater from Free People
well laughs all of my fashion favorites
so I kind of want to move on to my home
decor favorites um one of them is over
there so let me go get it so my first
home decor favorite is this pillow I
just said go up so weird I said hello um
but anyway this pillow is from Urban
Outfitters it says hey on it and this
pillow lives on my couch and I think
it's so cute it's like simple but still
a little bit quirky which is kind of how
I like to decorate my house and if you
guys don't know I shop so much for my
house
urban outfitters and the thing is they
have a lot of very expensive items there
especially for home decor but they go on
sale like 20% off all of home stuff for
the next 24 hours and that's when I buy
all of my things from there and that's
when I bought that pillow I also wanted
to mention this because I get so many
questions about this blanket and all my
videos all my Instagram pictures that I
have it in and it's this blanket it's
just a huge knit throw and then I also
have a cream one in my bedroom on my bed
and these blankets are handmade by a
girl named Sarah Luke oh the amount of
people that come over and that is the
first thing that they see and ask me
about is crazy if you like every other
person asks me about those blankets when
they come to my house and I mean that
just means people genuinely are like
drawn to this and think it's so
beautiful and it's hand made from wool
they're so soft such good quality I kind
of like wanted to answer your question
about where these are from but also
they're like a permanent favorite in my
life oh and I guess these two are home
favorites
I don't know health and wellness
favorites I don't really know if that's
category but I've talked about essential
oils a ton on my channel I won't bore
you and talk to you about them more
because I know some people don't care at
all about essential oils but if you are
curious about them and you would want me
to do a dedicated video to them and all
of their benefits and which ones I love
then comment down below but for now I'm
just gonna mention my two favorite
essential oils that I've been loving
this month the first one is Yves and I
love this one for adding to water and
then using it as a cleaner in my house
it has really good cleaning properties
in it and it also smells like fall I
also just got this huge bottle of
eucalyptus and I mean it smells as good
as you would imagine it to smell it's
just smells so fresh and any time I'm
diffusing essential oils I always pop a
few drops of this one
and because it just makes your house
feel clean fresh calming and finally I
will talk about my beauty favorites okay
so the first thing I want to share with
you guys is this primer this is the
Becca back this is the Becca
back lip priming filter and I think they
only have one shade of this but I had
heard of people trying this and loving
this for so long but I was just all like
and like I don't really need it but I
placed a huge order on Sephora of stuff
that I had just been wanting to try for
a while and this was one of those things
a hundred percent I'm sold
I love it this took place of my
toothpaste hangover RX primer I just
feel like this one gives you a little
bit more luminosity and a little bit
more like glow and I don't know if I'm
crazy but I also feel like this blurs
out my pores am I crazy
let me know if I'm crazy I finally got a
new tube of Lolita and then I remembered
how amazing Kat Von D's liquid lipstick
formula is I think it might be my
favorite liquid lipstick formula of all
time it's just super thin and
lightweight but super pigmented and like
will stay on your lips but it doesn't
dry my lips out so I love this shade and
I kind of want to get more shades if you
have a shade of this range that you love
please let me know because I am in the
market for some more of these okay and
then my last favorite lip product is
these this is the k'kaw by Kylie
cosmetics cream liquid lipsticks and I
was not going to buy these for such a
long time and then I just kept seeing
more and more pictures of them and I was
like I just want to try them out though
they came in one night and I was so
excited and so I put one of them on on
bare lips and I was like but not in a
good way
like I hated it I hated it so much I was
like why I just wasted fifty dollars
because I seriously hate
these by themselves but the reason that
they're in my favourites is because
these look beautiful
over liquid lipsticks seriously
beautiful like they transform them and
to like these creamy pigmented lip
colors that they weren't before
so I don't know these are kind of a
hated and a favorite and this last
Beauty favorite Trump's all of the other
beauty favorites in this video this is
the color pop super shock cheek
highlighter and this is in the shade
flexitarian I saw kathleenlights
mentioned these and I was like wow I
should get that that looks beautiful and
then I got it in real life like it came
in the mail and I was so so impressed by
this this formula is like creamy and
nice and really like the formula look at
this that is insanity I can't believe it
and then when you put it on your face it
also looks so beautiful it just looks
like the prettiest glow if you guys are
looking for a very affordable amazing
highlighter and I bet if you're looking
for an affordable highlighter if you're
just looking for a highlighter that is
amazing and super pigmented and will
make you look like a glowing goddess
then you should definitely check this
color pop highlighter out but I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video I
hope you'll have an amazing September
