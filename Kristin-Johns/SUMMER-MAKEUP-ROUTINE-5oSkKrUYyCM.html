you how to create this makeup look I
feel like when I think about summer
makeup I think of a very minimal eyes
glowy skin and maybe like a bold fiery
lips so this is kind of like my perfect
quintessential summer makeup look so I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
video and let's just get started for my
summer everyday makeup I really like to
focus on the skin so I want my skin it
to look very dewy and natural but I
still want some coverage so I'm going to
start out with my moisturizer so today
I'm using the first a beauty ultra
Repair hydra firm sleeping cream which i
use this day and night i don't really
know if that's very bad or not but i
just put a little bit on my finger and i
just feel like this is the most
moisturizing moisturizer ever the worst
thing is putting on foundation in it
just looking like dry and it's like
sticking to your skin weird so if you
apply moisturizer before then it helps a
lot next I'm going to be applying my
primer which is also very important you
can choose a bunch of different types of
primer depending on the skin that types
that you have in it the kind of skin day
you want to have so if you want to have
a very matte skin day then you can go
for something more mattifying if you
want something more dewy and luminous
and hydrated I really like this one this
is the Too Faced hangover RX primer and
I also really love the smell of this it
smells like coconut I feel like I
haven't done a makeup video and so long
I haven't however going to makeup video
since my wedding makeup tutorial and I
feel like on YouTube I used to only do
make a video I need to start doing more
how many down below if you want me to do
more makeup videos I will definitely do
that now I'm going to be moving on to
foundation which I'm very excited about
because I'm going to be showing you guys
a new foundation today that I've been
loving I've been using this every single
day for the past probably a little over
two weeks now this is the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer but I'm so happy to be
partnering with clinic to show you guys
the
amazing foundation because you guys know
I'm so picky with my foundations and I
hesitate to try new ones
so this foundation is $28 and one thing
that I love about it is the applicators
it's a little doe foot applicator so you
can kind of dot it on just the areas
that you want to conceal like spot
correct things or you can apply it all
over just like a regular foundation I'm
going to show you guys this is what my
skin looks like before and I'm just
going to pop some of that on my cheeks
okay so I sketch you guys in so you can
really see how easily it blends out so
here we go like it's blended out it
isn't like one second it's so nice and I
don't know if I told you this or not I'm
in the color 6.75 Stephanie so here's
what my skin looks like now that I have
on the foundation this is with no
concealer or anything so I'm going to be
concealing my under eyes with just my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and
Wendy Bourne be oh oh my nose is so
itchy I'm always told me that if your
nose itches it means someone wants to
kiss you have any of you ever heard out
or ships you just make that up
so after concealer for my summer makeup
routine I have been using a cream
contour which I have never really been a
cream contour girl but I got this from
benefit it's the hoola kwikki contour
stick and it's actually very nice and it
looks very good so I'm just going to put
some of that right here like that and
then right here and then I'm also going
to take it around my forehead and a
little bit down the sides of my nose and
then I'm going to take this little elf
brush it's the blending brush it looks
like this it's perfect for blending
cream out because it's a synthetic brush
so it doesn't absorb any of your product
and then I'm just going to blend D blend
now I'm just going to blend out the
forehead with my Beauty Blender because
you don't have to be as precise on your
forehead because you just kind of have
to rub it into your hairline and also
around my chin oh I forgot to pull it
nuts I got to do that in a second okay
so the contour oh it's all blended in
now I'm just going to take one more
cream product I'm going to take this
benefit Watts up cream highlighter and
I'm going to dot that on the tops of my
cheekbones and I'm just going to go on
my collar bail in a little bit and my
shoulders okay so here's what the skin
looks like before I said it it's just
very bronzed and glowy and pretty so I'm
going to just set it very lightly with
my Laura Mercier translucent powder this
is my all-time favorite powder I don't
even know any other powder because I've
been using this for so long but I'm just
going to be using the Beauty Blender and
in literally the tiniest tiniest amount
because I really want to keep my skin
looking dewy and natural so I'm just
gonna keep it and just put it right
under my eyes just so your makeup stays
and for blush today I'm going to be
using a Too Faced love flush in the
shade how deep is your love and it's
just this really pretty pink color and
I'm just going to be using a tiny bit of
this and putting that on my cheeks so
like I said the skin is really my main a
focus of this makeup look but we are
still going to do a little something to
our eyes so my eyes are already primed
and I'm going to take the shade luscious
from the Too Faced sweet peach palette
Lola and this is just a really pretty
like bronzy color and I'm actually just
going to take that with my finger and
put it all over my eyelid and I'm also
applying luscious to my bottom lash line
as well now I'm going to go put on some
mascara on my lower lashes and do my
brows off-camera
and I'll be
that's okay for lips today I have been
sitting here and I'm really torn on
which one to do so I think I just might
show you guys both of them I have more
of like a glossy pink color and this is
by it lipstick clean and the shade Jean
Queen and this is just a very easy
lipstick and then I also have the Kylie
matte liquid lipstick in the shade at 22
which is a really pretty orange deep
orange color and I love this for the
summer so I'll show you guys both
because the first one's really easy to
take off so this is the pink one and I'm
using the viewfinder as my mirror so I
hope I'm getting it on my lips so here's
the look with a more kinky glossy color
and I'll just wipe that off and show you
guys what the liquid lipstick looks like
oh I love this color so much here's what
the matte lipstick looks like it's a
really pretty color again that's Kylie's
a matte lipstick in the shade - um but
this one stays on like for a long time
but it's just a little bit less
comfortable in my opinion Oh should I do
a close-up I never know if I should do a
close-up look this is where I left the
real beauty users are like playing that
music and back I'm like oh oh
strike a pose ooh ooh I hope that you
