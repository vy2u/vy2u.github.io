you a little summer vacation haul me and
Marcus are actually Marcus eared me
really carefully let's be cute in this
video some people may think cool things
I honestly have come from a proto saying
I think I was saying me and Marcus are
actually probably gonna be gone when I
post this video on a vacation we are
going to London for a week and then
we're going to Greece for a week which I
am so excited about I've always wanted
to go to both places so I I cannot wait
so make sure that you're following our
joint channel because we're gonna be
vlogging our whole vacation and cannot
wait and so I got a bunch of cute things
to wear I feel like all of this is so
summery and cute so if any of you guys
are looking for some summer things then
keep watching so the first place that I
got a ton of key things from is from
Lulu's and I've been shopping at Lulu's
since college I have so many cute things
for summer so I'm so happy to be working
with them for this video and I thought
it was really sweet that they sent me a
lot of stuff so the first thing I want
to show you guys are these shoes I've
been wearing these non-stop you probably
tell they're a little bit dirty but
these shoes are so cute they have them
in three different colors they had like
a blue pair and I think a black pair and
then these but I thought these were just
so durable like this red checkered print
it kind of looks like a picnic I love
slides because they're just like the
easiest thing to throw on when you like
by the pool or at the beach so I got
these and the next thing that I got is
also red and white like checkered and
it's a swimsuit it's a little one-piece
it has a tie in the back this is
adorable and I seriously cannot wait to
wear this I haven't even tried it on yet
so I hope that it fits me and the next
thing that I have is a little two-piece
set and it's like this really cool
orange color with white stripes and it
ties in the front and then they're
really baggy at the bottom Oh what oh my
okay
they have really big split so I can do
that but I cannot wait to wear these
because then they have this top that
goes with them and it kind of like a
bandeau top but it has these super long
straps in the back that tie into this
really cool like big bow I cannot wait
to wear this like I feel like this is
the perfect vacation outfit okay oh the
next thing that I got are some kids from
Lulu's and I've never owned kids before
but I thought kids are kind of like
iconic and I would love to have a pair
for myself so I got these and just basic
white kids they have like an inch
platform on them and I always wear
tennis shoes all the time so I thought
that these were just like a great
addition to the tennis shoe family in my
closet I also got these shoes which I
wore all day yesterday and they're so
comfortable these just are like gonna be
my summer staple shoes along with those
other slides because sliding on shoes is
so much easier than like lacing them up
and buckling them up in yeah I just love
slides I also got some shorts and the
thing about shorts is is that they're
really hard for me to find ones that I
love but that was such a weird sentence
I got rid of all of my shorts because I
I just tried them on I was like these
don't even fit me very cute at all like
I just never really loved shorts and so
I was really hoping that these shorts
would be cute on me and I actually
really love how they fit I love the
color of them as well they're just like
a good basic pair of denim shorts which
I feel like I've been on the hunt for
for a while I also got this shirt it's
just a yellow striped shirt but the
thing that I love about this one is the
I almost said the formula the thing that
I love about this shirt is the texture
of it it's just super lightweight the
way it fits on your body is just really
nice like it's not too stiff I feel like
a lot of time colored shirts can just
kind of be unflattering like they can
make you look a little bit boxy but this
one
so slouchy and like slinky that it
really looks cute and flattering on oh I
also got this which I'm also so excited
about if you guys don't know lewis has
the cutest neck and hair scarves yeah
that's what these are neck and hair
scarves I'm just gonna put it in my hair
just to show you guys what it looks like
I love how it's like you can see it's a
double tones like silvery blue and dark
blue I think it's really cute I also got
this shirt which this looks like a
baby's shirt because it's super stretchy
but what I opened the package I was like
a little baby
I love off-the-shoulder tops with like
little overalls or I'm really sorry
campers bright yellow in camper you can
even just wear this with high-waisted
shorts or you can wear this so many ways
I love it I also got this dress from
Lulu it's just a white dress and it has
some lace-up details right there and it
also has some like kind of like
embroidery on it and I got this in a
size small and the last thing that I got
from Lulu's is this this is just a
simple white t-shirt but the edges have
like their ruffled sleeves and so does
the bottom and I just wear these types
of shirts all the time so I had to get
another one I probably have like 20 of
these shirts but I wear them all time so
it's okay I'll just do American Eagle
next cuz American Eagle is so random I
haven't shopped there in forever
I actually replenished my underwear
selection that because I had not bought
new underwear I want to say since like
my freshman year of college and I was
just I just needed a new selection so I
went online to American Eagle and got
like 20 new pairs of underwear best
decision of my life honestly but I also
found some other cute things on there
that I wanted to show you guys so I got
this kind of like linen II like
oversized overall overall it's super
like oversized and baggy but I think it
looks really cute with a tight
underneath it and it has a cute tie back
I would almost wear this as pajamas but
I would also wear it out so it's kind of
like a double win I think some people
might say that's unflattering but I love
oversized things so I don't really mind
if you don't like super oversized things
you probably wouldn't love that one also
got a sweater that my friend was telling
me about shoes that you have to get the
sweater it's on sale and it is the
comfiest thing ever so I hope they still
have it it's just a great sweater but
something about it is just so comfy like
I'm gonna live in this on the plains and
just all summer to sleep in so I wanted
to show you guys and it kind of has like
a cut-off bottom and it's just super
soft and lightweight and like squishy oh
and I have one random thing from Free
People this is the only thing I have
from there but it's this tank top and
I've actually worn this once before but
I just wanted to show it to you guys
because I think it's a really cute like
staple summer thing that you could wear
all the time I got two things from
forever if this might seem so random to
some people but this was like my
childhood and my high school and my
college so I had to get it it's an
instant ramen shirt and I think it's the
cutest thing ever I think this was like
ten dollars and I saw it on their
website and I was just like I mean I
have to
and just to sleep in or just wear with
like some denim shorts I just think it's
really cute and I mean I have to pay
homage because I ate instant ramen
probably every day for like ten years
so love that shirt and I also got a
swimsuit it's kind of a funny story
because I got this order from forever 21
because I actually got Marcos a lot of
stuff to wear on our vacation
um and I was like oh staying here while
I try on the swimsuit because I think
it's gonna be really cute so I put on
the top so cute
such a cute color super flattering like
just adorable a really cute swimsuit and
then the bottoms I did not realize
but they are pretty much yeah they're
pretty much a song like truly I was like
what the heck I did not remember it
looking like this on the website but I
could only buy the set together so I'm
probably never ever ever gonna wear
these hi way to suit a hot pink bottoms
but I think the top with maybe like some
yellow bottoms or something would be
really cute I did get two other
swimsuits and these are both from
Nordstrom and this was so written I'm
like I don't even know how I found this
on Nordstrom I think I was in their
sales section and this is from j.crew
and it's oh it's this swimsuit with
lemons all over it and it's the cutest
thing ever and it's high waisted and it
fits perfectly and I'm so happy about it
I feel like the color isn't coming off
like as purple and vibrant as it really
is in real life but I love this and this
is what the top looks like it's also
super cute and flattering triangle tops
are pretty much all I wear because I
just find them to be the most flattering
on my body shape but oh I just love this
bikini I think it's really really good
which is a cute then I also got this
swimsuit that I have not tried on yet
and I'm a little skeptical of it but I
think it might work this one was from
Topshop but I got it on line at
Nordstrom and it's like this neon pink
green and light pink swimsuit it's just
super basic like there's not even any
padding in it and then this is what the
bottoms look like just like regular
bottoms but again I'm like is this a
thong I think it might be but I haven't
tried this on yet I'll try it on and
then I'll insert here if it's a thong or
not and the final thing I got are these
Nikes and again I am in love with white
tennis shoes and I wear them all the
time I was actually on the phone with my
friend when I was shopping and I was
like look how cool these tennis shoes
are and they were like do not get those
those are not cute Kristin
I was like wait why do I love these I
think that they're so cool but these are
Nike airs I have no idea anything about
tune issues but if I can find them and
link them I definitely will that's it
for today's summer haul and if you did
