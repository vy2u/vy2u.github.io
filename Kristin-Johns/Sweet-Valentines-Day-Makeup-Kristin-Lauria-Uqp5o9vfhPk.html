you and when I was making this look I
really wanted to do just like a sweet
daytime Valentine's Day look so I just
use like pinky colors and I really like
how it turned out so I hope you guys
like it as well and I also show you guys
my perfume and nail polish and outfit at
the end so I hope you guys like that and
if you want to see how I got this look
then just keep watching so the first
thing that I'm going to be doing today
is putting on some chapstick because my
lips are kind of dry right now so then
by the end of our makeup being done and
then our lips will be all ready for our
lipstick I'm just using this it's just
like Vaseline chapstick the next thing
that I'm going to be using is the Make
Up For Ever smoothing primer and I love
this I've been using it for a while now
and it's a sample size so I'm kind of
surprised that it's still lasting you
this long but I'm just going to be
putting this in my t-zone and I'm going
to be using the NARS Pro prime smudge
proof eyeshadow base and I'm just going
to put that on my eyelids and this will
just help prevent any creasing the
foundation I'm still using the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation and I'm
actually going to be putting it on with
a damp Beauty Blender and I don't really
use this Beauty Blender a lot because I
kind of forget about it because it's
just in my drawer so let's see how this
works for concealer I'm going to be
mixing these two I'm going to be using
the Naked skin concealer and instant age
rewind and just putting those under my
eyes I'm just going to set everything
and I'm going to be using the laura
mercier um translucent powder and I'm
still going to be using my damp Beauty
Blender to put on this and I've actually
never done this before
but I see people doing it so I think you
can do it and I think that's too much
but let's just see what happens
okay now that my face is set I'm going
to move on to my eyes so I will zoom you
guys in so you can see a little bit
better first what I'm going to be using
is the Naked 3 palette feel like this
palette is perfect for Valentine's Day
because it just has a bunch of like
pinky tones and gold tones gonna take
the shade nooner which is just this like
matte mauve tone color and I'm going to
put that in my crease to find my crease
I kind of just look up and see where
there's like a shadow but also if you
don't have a crease or you have like
smaller eyes you can actually draw your
own crease with your eye shadow so just
put it a little bit above your lid and
it will like work the exact same way now
that we have a little bit of that matte
shade in the crease I'm just going to be
taking a little bit of buzz and I'm
going to be putting that on the outer
corner of my eyes
now for the inner part of the eye I'm
going to use this pigment from Mac and
it's called what is it called it's
called naked and I think this is the
perfect like natural brightening color
for the lid so I'm going to be using
that and I'm going to be using the same
brush I just wiped it off a little bit
then I'm just going to take a baby bit
of the color nooner and putting that
underneath my lower lash line now for
eyeliner I'm going to be using the
Physicians Formula eye booster and I'm
just going to be doing a wing okay now
I'm going to curl my eyelashes and put
on some mascara and today I'm going to
be using these eyelashes they're from
the war and I actually just got these at
Sephora today I've never used them so
hopefully I like them I'll leave the
name down below because I can't find it
on the box but I will have everything
that I use in this video linked down
below my biggest biggest tip when you're
applying fake eyelashes is to apply the
glue and wait like one or two minutes to
let the glue dry because that will make
putting them on so much easier and it
will make your life just so much easier
okay so I think that the glue is tacky
so I'm just gonna pop these on hopefully
this goes well
okay I think these are my favorite
lashes I have ever used they are so
pretty and again I don't know the exact
name of them
but I'll link them down below and these
lashes Bible or are kind of expensive
but I think that they're worth it
because they said you can use them like
over 20 times so I'm definitely going to
be doing that because these things were
not cheap okay now I'm going to be
finishing the face since the eyes are
done and I'm just going to be using the
Anastasia brow powder and just an angled
brush like I always do fill in my
eyebrows I'm going to be using the
hourglass ambient lighting bronzer in
radiant bronze light and I love this
bronzer so much I talked about it in a
few of my videos and it's just the best
and for my cheeks I'm going to be
starting off with a little bit of the
Becca Beach tint in fig / opal and I'm
just going to be applying that to my
cheeks and then over top of the Becca
Beach tent I'm going to be using the Too
Faced sweethearts blush and this one is
in candy glow and this is just the
cutest packaging to be honest I only
bought it because it was so cute looking
but it actually does work really well
and I'm just going to be putting that on
the apples of my cheeks I'm going to be
using Mac's lip liner and world first
and this is like the exact same color as
my lips but the lipstick that I'm going
to be using today is a little bit more
glossy so this will just help the color
stay on a little bit longer then for my
lipstick I'm going to be using this by
L'Oreal I think this is by L'Oreal yes
it's the L'Oreal color riche lipstick
and sheer linen
and this is so comfortable on your lips
it tastes good smells good so that is it
for my makeup today I also thought I
should share with you what perfume I'm
probably gonna wear on Valentine's and
it is this by Jo Malone and it is the
best smell ever is the nectarine blossom
and honey and that is exactly what
smells like it just smells like a sweet
nectarine and I love it so much and for
my nails I'm gonna be wearing ESI's
french affair I have it on like three of
my nails right now because I picked it
off but I'm gonna be repainting them
okay so I'm gonna try to show you guys
my outfit because a lot of you have been
asking for kind of like more style
videos in outfit of the days so I'm
going to attempt to do this my shirt is
from forever 21 and this kimono is from
American Eagle and these jeans are also
from American Eagle and I'm just wearing
some booties that are from hordes drum
rack okay guys I hope that you liked
