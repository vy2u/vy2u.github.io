some peppermint tea because my throat
hurts
so bad right now it's actually about two
o'clock in the afternoon already I don't
know how this day is going by so fast
but me and Marcus had a meeting a very
exciting meeting today and we just got
back got some lunch and my throat is
hurting so bad but yeah so I'm making
myself some some peppermint tea
so let me microwave that really quick
this tea bag is so weird because it
doesn't have a string on it so I guess
you just plop it in there does anyone
else's dogs just stay right by their
feet whenever they're in the kitchen
camford usually does where the heck is
camper oh he's right there they just
stayed with my feet the entire time into
the kitchen to catch a scrap you want to
catch a scrap I feel like honey hasn't
been in as many videos as she should
you're already getting bigger you're
already getting bigger what the heck is
up with that
I feel like I always end up sitting
right here behind my couch every time
I'm filming just you guys this is where
the best lighting is and especially if I
want to show you guys some things you
can actually see it this is just the
best place in my house to do it so I'm
sorry that we always end up in this
random corner of my house I did want to
show you guys an exciting package that
came in the mail oh it's really heavy
and I'm really sore so I'm gonna try to
pick it up it is a bunch of new clothes
from thread up and I mentioned thread up
before on my channel and when I
mentioned it you guys went crazy and
loved it and I got so many tweets from
you guys saying that you went shopping
on thread up and that made me so happy
because it truly is a company that I
completely support basically if you
don't know thread up is a huge online
thrift store but it's more special than
that because you can actually find
insanely amazing brands on there you can
search pretty much any brand and they
have stuff from them
you can also narrow it on your size you
can narrow down to sweaters shoes
whatever you want and also they make
sure all their products are very good
quality it's not like you're gonna get a
sweater with a huge hole in it or
anything they make sure that the quality
is very good so I'm so happy that they
are sponsoring this video because I
truly truly love thredUP but the first
thing I'll show you I'm already holding
it in my hand is this sweater this
sweater was originally from Gap and it's
just a really nice basic white
turtleneck and I love these huge Rolly
turtlenecks for the fall I think they
just look so cozy and this one is white
and it's just a very good basic piece I
feel like you have to have a white
turtleneck for the winter and the fall
and the next thing is not very falling
but this might be my favorite thing that
I got in my whole order this is this red
like orange a red dress it goes all the
way down and then there's a tie you'll
see it better when I actually try it on
but this is just the prettiest dress I
can't wait to wear it on a date night
with Marcus cuz I'm just I don't even
know how to explain it but there's
something really special about this
dress it's like the sleeves and the cut
of it and everything is so flattering
and I don't own anything even close to
like it so I'm so happy about this I
also got a few more sweaters again this
was a very fall inspired clothing haul
but I got this this is a little Free
People sweater and I love the pattern of
this sweater there's just so many
different like there's stripes
there's little zigzags there's this tie
detail at the front and it's kind of
cinched in the bottom like that but I
feel like this is just gonna be so cute
to wear with some I picture this
like Keynes and some brown booties oh
this is what I'm so excited for this is
a bomber jacket but unlike any bomber
jacket I've ever seen this thing is so
cool it has these wool dots all over it
and it feels very warm like usually
bomber jackets are that thin satin
material or I guess they can be that
thick click satin with like cotton
inside of it but this one just feels
very warm and it's kind of like Oh
staple piece and I also got another
jacket and well this isn't really a
jacket this is not a vest this was
originally from Zara I had actually been
looking for one of these but they are so
expensive and I didn't want a real fur
one like this so I'm so happy that I
found this and I can't wait to wear this
with like a simple little long-sleeve
shirt some jeans some black boots you
feel like that would be so cute and then
the last thing that I got actually has a
story behind it I had been looking for a
pleated faux leather skirt for so long
and I could not find one anywhere and
like a few months ago I feel like they
had them in every single store and I
just never bought one and then when I
actually wanted one I couldn't find one
anywhere so when I saw this on thredUP I
was so happy because it was in my size
and it was originally from Topshop so
I'm so excited to wear this so that is
everything that I got from thredUP
my box is empty but thredUP is actually
offering you guys 40% off of your first
order you can just use the link in my
description box and use the code of
Kristin and you can get 40% off which i
think is really awesome
I'm kind of sad because all of these
clothes are so fall-like and I think
California just got into like another
heatwave because it is 101 degrees
outside right now it is 104 degrees
outside like where did fall go me and
Marcus are now off to my favorite place
in the whole world where are we going
oh my dust what happened there's a
compliers
like a ton of ash Paul dust you know
what oh my gosh honey and campers
destroyed our dirt patch but anyway
we're going to the garden center to buy
some more plans because two of my plants
are just horribly ugly right now because
they died so I just need to replace them
and I also my dream would be to get a
fiddle leaf tree but I don't know if
they're gonna have any in stock and we
won't probably be able to fit it in our
bike but if they do have a fiddle leaf
I'm gonna buy it okay
this is how we transport groceries and
plants and dogs we hook this thing that
Marcus made up to the bike and it's like
a little carrier we're here some people
happy places like the mall or maybe like
the beach my happy place is the garden
center my happy place is on that bike
that I built just look at it which is a
free sucker I need this
she's cool yeah I'm getting this
look at these oh look at this
the tiny guide you just two of these
pretty much
blank flipper gave us this tray it's so
perfect in them
doo-doo-doo-doo now put their seatbelt
on Kristen
drive safe we have precious cargo these
are the plants that are going by by this
plant which has been crusty since the
day I bought it and I just can't revive
it and then this plant which just gives
me so much strife and it's just oh I
just get so annoyed of it look you
didn't even do a good job are you
serious
you found it in like 30 seconds you're
not getting this don't never get it
there is a literal trashcan here for
this babe oh my gosh
you're not getting it you'll never check
this pop this is called the holy plant
see all the holes oh I know it's called
it's called the Caddy Euler plant
because it looks like caterpillar ate it
hmm I think we'll have to keep working I
just want a clock with her just wiggling
good to him look at that Nick you think
she'd have enough plants in the house
but she does it it is dinnertime and
lighting in my kitchen is horrendous but
it's the case so tonight I'm gonna be
making a spaghetti squash with turkey
meat sauce is that what it's called when
it's sauce with me is they just called
them the meat sauce because that's the
grossest name ever um but I'll show you
guys how I like to make my spaghetti
squashes it's super easy
it was way too hard to cut this immunity
squash on camera so I had to put away
the camera and just really focus on it
it took me about ten minutes cuz that
thing was hard as a rock
but the spaghetti squash is now cooking
in the oven it smells so good and then I
I just have to wait for that for about I
think it's like 40 minutes that it has
to cook and then I'll show you how to
make the rest of dinner so here is what
this spaghetti squash looks like after
it's been cooked and then you just take
your fork I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to do this with one hand yeah
probably not but basically yeah it's
kind of working
you can see when you scrape it with the
fork it turns into like pasta kind of
thing so I'm just gonna do that to both
of these then I'm gonna put the pasta
sauce on top and then I made some some
little salads and look at this scones
what the heck scones had this pumpkin
spice go to mix tamper does that smell
amazing to you so I just made some of
these - are you enjoying my feet you're
keeping me so woman cambers like I used
to fit there but not anymore okay dinner
is ready it was so easy I feel like a
little ashamed but it's okay just a nice
little salad some whatever you would
call that pasta but not really and I
poured marks a glass of wine because he
loves wine okay dinner was a success and
ER friend came over and we just devoured
these scones and if you see these scones
at Trader Joe's I would highly recommend
the maple icing or the maple glaze was
so good always have a tiny a tiny way
hmm
I look so oily right now so weird
because my skin is very not oily do you
see this I never look like this I kind
of like it it's very glowy I'm about to
feed camphor and honey but I had to get
this on film about how excited she gets
before food time okay it's time for food
who's excited camper we can see you
you're not it goes okay guys I think
that is the end of today's vlog I really
wanted to end this vlog with another
devotion but I'm just so tired I can't
even bear to keep my eyes up friends for
like two four seconds oh okay okay but I
had an idea and instead of a devotion
for this vlog maybe you guys can comment
down below something you need to be
prayed for and then in the comments if
you guys want to pray for each other and
I'll pray for you so then it's kind of
it's not technically devotion but it's
still something that's happy so um I
hope you guys enjoyed this vlog if you
did please give it a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for
new videos every week and I love you
guys and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
