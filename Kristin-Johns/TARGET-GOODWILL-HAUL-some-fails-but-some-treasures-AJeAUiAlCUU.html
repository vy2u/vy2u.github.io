thorough a target haul and the thrift
store haul I just got back from Target I
got a lot of things and I also went to
the thrift store yesterday and today so
I thought target and thrifting mixed
together in a haul would be like really
fun to watch honestly I did get some
really cute things from Target but a lot
of this is like my groceries so the
first bag from Target I have is kind of
like the up food bag so I'll do this one
first
I don't really shop a lot for my
groceries that target I don't know why I
usually just go to Trader Joe's but I
did get some fruit because their fruit
looks really good I got some
strawberries I've never done a video
like this for that but I also got three
packs of white corn tortillas this is
what I used to make my famous shrimp
tacos so I think we're gonna be having
some friends over later this week so I
needed a lot I also got some raspberries
they got a little smushed oh it's okay
it's okay I also got this which is not
kind of a sad story behind it because I
initially got two of these little sugar
jars but then when I was checking out
one of them slipped through the hole of
the shopping cart and shattered
everywhere and it was very embarrassing
and so then I just ended up getting one
and I told Lady don't worry
I'll buy it she was like no don't buy it
so that was really nice they also got
some treats for the pup I got some of
these milos kitchen homestyle dog treats
chicken meatballs and I had to get this
brand because is that not camper like
that is camper and I also got steak
grillers from the same brand so I think
that's like my grocery section size so
Marcus every time I cook anything
whether it be chicken steak
any type of meal that I cook he's always
like doing his barbecue sauce and I'm
always like no we don't have barbecue
sauce so I decided to get some barbecue
sauce and it was buy one get one free
I'm sorry if this is boring because I
have never talked about barbecue sauce
on my channel I also got two I actually
bought three but I already drank one
when I was in the store um these little
chocolate milks they're by the brand
ripple and they're dairy free and they
are so good and really I just thought my
chocolate milk phase my life was over
because I just no chocolate milk is
really bad for me so I was just like I
guess I'll never really be able to drink
chocolate milk but this is actually not
horrible for you it still has a lot of
sugar in it yeah it's still not the best
but it is way better than regular
chocolate milk and it's cool that it's
plant-based as well it has like peas in
it but it still tastes so good
I showed this on my Instagram story as
really excited about this I got this new
barn unsweetened vanilla almond milk it
looks like this and I've heard so many
people say that this is like the best
almond milk so I'm very excited to try
it because I don't we don't really drink
regular milk in our house but we do love
almond milk so I'm always looking for a
new flavor um I also got this is kind of
random but it's just a utensils
organizer and the one that we have right
now is actually for Marcus's first ever
apartment I think it actually might be
from his college apartment but it's kind
of just falling apart so I thought the
best one was nice and I was actually
thinking about getting one of these like
a wooden one for bed last night and I'm
glad that I found one these are the
things I think of before and I think
this is the fun bag
I got some salad saucers from Magnolia
um Magnolia Carthon han hearthat tone
what person yeah Carthon hand is really
cute and so I always stop by there when
I'm in target and I thought that this
was a cute little set of salad mixers it
also got a new shower curtain liner this
was on clearance for 698 and we just
needed a new one of these because honey
ripped up our other shower liner so had
to get one of these also got this candle
and this candle is so out of my regular
scope of sense that I like but this
smells really good and this is the water
lily aloe like neither of those things I
don't think I've ever liked in a candle
it's something you had it it's kind of
you know what it is it feels like
nostalgic to me because this smells
exactly like my mom's moisturizer that
she always used growing up I think
that's why I like it but I also like top
of it too I got this
tell me if this is bad or not because I
don't know if it's bad or not it's
called pet fresh carpet odor eliminator
and basically I think that you just
sprinkle it on your carpet and then you
vacuum it up but I know that some people
say putting things in your carpet is bad
because if your dogs lay on it it's like
chemicals so I was like I felt like
guilty for buying this but I was also
like I bet our house would smell so good
if I used something like this on the
carpets but if y'all tell me this is
absolutely horrible I won't use it and
I'll just return it but no I'm torn I
also got this bandana from universal
thread it's a brand that target carries
now it's kind of like denim II looking
and it has some stars on it I love a
good band
oh okay I got some hint of lime chips
because these are the best chips
honestly these are one of my favorite
foods ever so I just like to happen
around the house yes want some chips or
I want some chips I also got this
blanket that I think I'm going to love
it was me see how much it was it was
$29.99 which is crazy
but I think I'm gonna like it I haven't
even seen what looks like open so it's
the moment of truth right now
I like this color even though I don't
really incorporate a ton of color into
my house I want to start doing it more
so it has these little pom-poms that's
end and I think it is very cute it's
pretty soft it's more like of a linen II
material hmm yeah I could snuggle in
this and I also got this which I have
been eyeing at Target for probably since
it came out like this new Home
Collection came out I also bought some
Charmin ultra toilet paper it's
embarrassing how long that we've been
out of toilet paper in the south and the
last thing ah it's for Marcus I got him
some Lacroix lemon flavor and melon
whole mellow
melon Paul mellow he loves the cry I
cannot drink anything with carbonation
in it it hurts my throat so those are
definitely for him okay now I will move
on to Goodwill I went to Goodwill twice
in the past two days and oh my foots
asleep
oh it's really asleep it's bad bad I got
a lot of cute things from Goodwill so
I'm gonna show you also how cute is this
jumpsuit from made well I'll link it
down below if I can find it but it's so
comfy and cute okay
so the first thing that I got at
Goodwill was this little flower sister
my friend Hannah actually found this at
Goodwill and then she was like oh I
already have Wendy wants this and I was
like yeah that's really cool so
basically it's just like a sifter for
your sugar or whatever and I like how
it's vintage looking I also got this
little set of boxes so it's a box in a
box see look a box in a box I also got a
set of candlestick look how cool these
are and I also have a 14 but it's
sitting over there so I'll just show you
these three how cool are these and I
love candlesticks just like putting
candles around your house and lighting
them with guests are here just like
really sets the mood you know what I'm
saying
and these were two ninety nine to ninety
nine inch for brass candlesticks I
thought good was getting kind of like
pricey you know what I'm saying I also
got these two jars and they were 99
cents each again I always say this when
I do thrifting hauls but you can never
have too many jars oh these are two
things that I'm not sure about
especially this dress I didn't try on
this dress because I don't really ever
try on stuff when I go through shopping
um but this dress I think it has
potential but it also has potential to
be bad so I'll show it to you I'll try
it on and we'll see together if it's
cute but it looks like this I like the
top of it the top is really cute like I
like the cuffed sleeves and the little
tie I think it's a no I think it's just
I
I think it's an L yeah okay I'm just
gonna say it's an O
like can you see how it's like probably
has like three inches of extra fabric if
it was like tight right there it would
be cute but since it sags down it's kind
of like unflattering and of course I
can't go to Goodwill without getting a
soft sweater so I got this one this is
from the brand structure and it was in
the boys section and it's just a really
soft navy blue sweater and I like that
it has a pocket on it this is very cute
very soft it's a yes my second trip to
could will actually took place today and
first I got this jacket from the men's
section honestly I spend most of my time
in the men's section to be honest this
is a black corduroy jacket and I thought
this would be really cute to throw over
any outfit when I'm cold do you know my
keys always tells me Kristen you've got
to start bringing a jacket everywhere we
go because you're always taking mine
you're always cold so maybe this will be
like my designated jacket always bring
places I kind of feel like I'm being
swallowed by this coat right now maybe
this would be cute on Markus though
mm-hmm oh I also got this green sweater
it's just a crewneck sweater but it's
pretty long and I'm gonna cut it into a
crop top so I just cut this sweater
really quick so it's like kind of
jaggedy but that's okay cuz in the wash
it'll just kind of like roll up like
nice and natural but I love this very
cute love the color
these are Calvin Klein high-waisted
jeans I haven't tried them on yet so I
don't know for sure if they're gonna be
a really great fit but I'm really hoping
I have a pair of jeans that I wear all
the time that will make this but they're
from urban and of course they were like
way more expensive and I get so many
compliments on them so I'm hoping that
these will fit me I am so happy right
now look at
these are perfect these actually fit me
better than my ones from urban I'm not
even joking you what I'm so shy I also
got these which I'm a little more
skeptical about these are in the boys
section and I don't even I don't even
know if these are gonna be massive but I
thought that these had potential to be
cute high-waisted shorts okay first of
all they fit perfectly which is like a
number one huge score and then if I
unroll them they look a little bit
strange so I I don't know tell me what
which way you look better I guess either
way is fine I'm just very happy that
these fit well and last but not least I
got this very dusty bench or like
storage bench I don't even know what you
would call this I need to honestly take
this outside and hose it down because it
is so dusty I think that this would just
be cute like in a little closet like a
shoe rack or even out somewhere but I'm
just gonna have to figure out where to
put it so that is everything that I got
from Target and goodwill I liked this
haul I thought this was fun so if you
did like this video please give it a
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and I love you guys and I
will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
