11 o'clock in the morning and I'm
vlogging because if you don't already
know I'm gonna try to start vlogging at
least once a week on my channel so I try
to post Wednesdays and Sundays so one of
those two days you guys will be getting
a vlog for me because I know you guys
love vlogs and I love doing vlogs so I
decided it's just it's just kind of
perfect to do at least one blog a week
sorry if you can hear camper panting he
was just outside so hot outside but
today I have a very busy day and I
always feel a little bit stressed out
when I have super busy days like when it
comes to work stuff but the first thing
I wanted to show you guys is my outfit
cuz I just got two new cute things that
I'm wearing today my top is from Zara I
just got it like two days ago and it has
little pearls on it and it's so cute oh
it has pearls in the back I didn't think
that did and then I'm wearing these
pants that are from made well they are
so cute they're like little business
looking trousers and I think they're so
adorable and then my shoes are from
forever 21 they were like twelve dollars
so that's my outfit for today I do have
a business meeting
and like oh dang it's later than I
thought it's already 1222 I thought it
was like 11:00 I have a business meeting
in 30 minutes it's just like a FaceTime
meeting and then I have another like
meeting type thing at 3:00 but something
very exciting just came in the mail like
10 minutes ago huh and I didn't think
that I was gonna get this package
because everyone had already kind of
gotten this one and I was like I might
just not get it but look what came in
the mail I think this is candy Johnson
little PR package I'm going to open it
no you see this camper this is not toy
ever
okay so I unwrapped it I had to take a
picture of it post one stream but look
how cute this is it's a little lollipop
with all of her new products and I know
this is available at Ulta I just want to
tell you guys about the time that I met
candy because she made such a huge
impact on me I met her at playlist live
before I ever started doing YouTube
because I went with Markus it was like
over two years ago I think and I went up
to her and introduced myself to her
expense I have watched her videos
forever and she was the sweetest person
and that just says so much because a lot
of youtubers aren't the nicest
especially if you're not even a youtuber
and you're going up to them and
introducing yourself like I didn't have
anything to like offer her she was so
nice to me and I told her that I was
really interested in starting a YouTube
channel and I was like I don't know if I
should do it blah blah blah and she was
like no you should totally do it you
would be amazing and she was just so
nice and super encouraging and one of
the huge reasons that I even started
doing YouTube ever since then I've just
totally loved her and I know there's a
million other people here on YouTube
that just say she is the nicest person
ever because guys I'm not joking you she
truly is the nicest person ever I'm so
excited about this I'm so proud of her
and I'm so excited to try these products
okay so the first thing camber is
playing with his toys
sorry about that the first thing in here
is her eyeshadow palette I'm so excited
look how cute this packaging is look at
that so pretty I'm so excited for sweet
toffee that copper shimmery color is so
pretty and she also came out with this
little Luminizer says I want candy candy
glow Luminizer it looks like this oh it
smells so good that's why he won't eat
it because it really does oh my gosh it
smells like serious amazingness look how
pretty that is look at that if that just
shows you I'm good at smells because he
wants to eat it so bad wow I'm so
excited to use that and then actually in
the thing that I'm most excited for are
these lipsticks we have sweet and sour
which is a really pretty like bright
coral orange color oh oh that smells
like serious candy I'm not joking
we have tropical punch I think this is
like a bright pink one oh this is so
bright wait this one kind of looks like
the one I'm wearing right now um but
this is a bright pink looks like purple
as well this one called melted ice cream
she showed in her video how you can use
it to like transform how you can use it
like transform other lipstick colors
like put it in the middle and make some
light so that's what this one looks like
it's just like super nude and then the
last one we have which I actually
already tried this one and I'm obsessed
with it
this one is called
ashle babies which is so pretty this is
like my everyday favorite kind of color
so I'm so excited to use all of these
I'll probably be using them in an
upcoming video okay the first meeting of
the day is done and finished like thirty
minutes to go but then I could not find
my vlog camera anyway I'm gonna just
stop it and now that I got through and I
wanted to show you guys look how cute
okay so I got this little painting of
this deer from society6 they have a ton
of really cute little prints and then I
painted this well I like calligraphy
this and then painted this little peach
isn't this the cutest thing ever
I'm obsessed and then um I got these two
little shelves from Urban Outfitters and
then I just put some really cute little
things on it so I have this little
perfume on it this is my favorite
perfume I wear it every single day and
then this little cactus this little
thing that holds all of our flossers and
then up here on the top shelf we have
this J that a lovely subscriber sent us
which is just the nicest thing ever also
put this candle from world market up
there and then this picture which also
another subscriber sent us she sent us
this really cute little kind of like
frame with this picture of us on it it
just went perfectly so I'm very happy
about this because our bathroom was just
feeling very empty and now I feel like
it's a little more filled up
I've been doing this with them and you
hasn't caught it so I decided but before
second thing I have to do they I'm not
curl my hair but look how much longer my
hair has gone I'm gonna get it cut so
bad look at this I'm not joking Marcus
look at this dress what another look
what do you have it so I'm chopping my
hair but now I'm gonna curl it and my
regular curling iron actually broke when
I was traveling so now I only have this
tiny one and I just need to get a new
one seriously bad okay my hair is off
girl let me it look what if I wore my
hair like this I brushed it all out with
my fingers mess it all up oh it's very
curly
I forget how curly this curling wand
makes my hair okay before I leave for my
work thing that I have in a little bit I
am gonna make myself a smoothie and I
have to show you guys my new obsession
it is called daily harvest and they send
you little pre-made smoothies but you
can also get soups and you can also get
like nice creams which are just like
really healthy things that are like ice
creams so I have a bunch of smoothies
here and they come in these little cups
that all you have to do is look on the
back and it tells you all of the
ingredients that come in it so this one
is banana spinach cacao nib cashew water
peppermint chlorella and vanilla bean
which that actually sounds very good but
I have one that I had my eye on oh this
one this one sounds so good to me this
one is mango pineapple papaya macadamia
nut and then something that I can't
pronounce a Creole but they come in then
all of the ingredients are in here and
it's all super food ingredients like
they're all very healthy
very good for you then all you have to
do into your blender and then it gives
you like the best option for it so this
one says something light like coconut
water would be good with this one so let
me get my coconut water and then I just
fill it about like almost to the top
with the liquid and then you blend it
and it literally takes 30 seconds it is
the best thing ever
fastest meal you could ever have and
another thing that I love about daily
harvest is that they harvest their fruit
all organically it's all unrefined and
frozen at the peak ripeness so it always
just tastes very fresh and delicious and
I've been making these so much for me
and Marcus and Marcus loves them and I
love them because they're so fast and
you guys can go to daily harvest comm
and enter the code Kristen and you can
get three items from your first box
completely free so I think that's a
great deal guys I just got out of my
walk out it's literally 4:10
and my car is getting towed and I also
have to pay ticket completely separate
so that's just freaking wonderful
literally the lady was here riding the
ticket and I was like wait it's only
eight minutes past she's like it doesn't
matter
I guess that's just what you get for
living in LA sometime
you seriously still cannot believe I
can't believe that I also can't believe
like I don't even know what I would do
if my car was just gone because I don't
even know where I am in LA right now and
that would have just been very scary but
well that put it a little bit of a
damper on my day to be honest I just got
home I'm still sad about that ticket but
I changed into something a little bit
more comfy look how cute this shirt is I
got it from deep hop and look it says it
has two little bears on it with a heart
balloon and then it says California
lovers is that the cutest thing ever
so I just put on a pair of black jeans
and I'm chillin I'm absolutely starving
but me and Lexi and Kody and Marcus are
going out on like a dinner meeting
tonight
so I shouldn't eat really because I got
saved my appetite but I did want to show
you guys a few things um I have been
kind of getting on more of a natural oh
my gosh I've been trying to get how do I
say it I've been trying to incorporate
more natural things into our lives
because really ever since I started
getting into like essential oils and
diffusing I've just kind of been
inspired to incorporate more natural
things into my life so the first thing I
want to show you guys is my diffuser
this is what it looks like I'm sure a
lot of you guys have heard of Young
Living before it's a great company they
sell very pure forms of essential oils
and I love them so much so I just take
the top off of this and I just pour my
water in there up into the red line
right now I'm going to diffuse some
eucalyptus some lavender so I can chill
out because that ticket really stressed
me out
and I'm also gonna be diffusing some
lemon because it just makes everything
Oh focus on lemon it just makes
everything smell super fresh so I just
put a few drops of each into the
diffuser so I'll do like four drops of
eucalyptus and then I'll do same
probably four drops of lavender and then
like three drops of lemon
sorry campers making a lot of noise
can't bear stop one two oh that was a
lot more than I thought it was gonna be
and then I just pop this right back on
and then you can just press that and
press it again so it's light and then I
don't know if you can see but it's
diffusing and it makes me feel so
relaxed and seriously before I started
using oils I didn't know anything about
them and I just I wasn't like a super
big believer in it just because I didn't
know anything about it and I'd never
used them but ever since I've been using
essential oils I used them in so many
different aspects of my life I I like
would be so sad if I didn't have them
anymore so if you guys are interested in
essential oils I'm actually a part of
Young Living and I have a link that you
can get your starter kit which includes
twelve different oils like all my
favorite oils and this diffuser for a
really great price so I'll link that
below if you are interested because I
love oils so much analysts go ahead and
show you the natural deodorant that
we've been using because I get a lot of
questions from my friends about that
because it's very hard to find a
deodorant that's natural that works
that's not weird so this one is called
Schmitz and we get the smell bergamot
and lime and it smells so good and this
actually works it has no aluminum no
propylene glycol and no artificial
fragrance and you can actually find this
brand at t.j.maxx as well I ordered this
one from Amazon and then I
t.j.maxx oh now I have to but yeah I
just wanted to show you guys that
because deodorant is the thing that I
got most freaked out about natural wise
because oh there's such bad things in
deodorant and it can be so bad so I
definitely recommend that one just got
back from dinner it was so fun and guess
what I'm gonna do right now I'm gonna
run myself a back I'm gonna use one of
mine wait where is it oh one my bath
bomb hey I'm gonna run the bath now wait
can't forgive her you're not taking you
back I'm taking you back come on do you
have a bit
I'm in bed I probably look crazy because
I just put on self-tanner and my face
just looks really dirty but I'm gonna be
tan in the morning um but I love you
guys thank you for watching today's vlog
today was kind of a mix between a really
good day and also a really bad day so at
least you guys got to kind of experience
it with me I can kind of laugh at it
because I filmed it so I don't know why
I just feel like it makes it a little
bit more funny but I love you guys so
