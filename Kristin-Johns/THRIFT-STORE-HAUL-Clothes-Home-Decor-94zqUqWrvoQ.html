you some things that I have picked up
from sister store and camper it is
sitting right next to me and I'm going
to get him a non squeaky toy really
quick like I said I'm gonna be showing
y'all some things from sister and I know
you can't necessarily find these same
things maybe as with your store but I'm
going to be telling you some of things
that I look for when I go shopping at
sister because I know that it can be a
little bit daunting for some people like
I know some people don't really enjoy
their shopping but it's seriously one of
my favorite things to do and I have
gotten some of my all-time most loved
things from us the first or I have a
bunch of clothes and then I also have
home decor stuff that I'm going to be
showing y'all today
and I know you can't necessarily find
these exact things probably at your
thrift store but I am going to be
telling you guys some of my favorite
tips and tricks that I like to use when
I'm still shopping and what I like to
look for and the first thing is this
little shirt it doesn't even have a tag
on it so I have no idea what brand it is
but it's just this little pink floral
top and it has buttons down it and then
the bottom has a little ruffle and this
shirt kind of has like puffy sleeves
which aren't my favorite I tried to cut
out the shoulder pads that were in here
and it was the weirdest thing ever it
was like powder inside of the shoulder
pads like it wasn't actual shoulder cap
it was like this weird insulation
material so I cut all that out so
hopefully now it'll be less puffy of
shoulders but I really like this shirt I
like how it's really like slouchy and
the pattern is my favorite part just
like this really cool like peachy
vintagey floral pattern and this shirt
kind of brings me to like my first tip
that I wanted to share with you guys out
there shopping that I do I usually look
for patterns that I really like patterns
and colors so I just saw this hanging on
the rack with like
other things I was like oh that looks so
pretty that's how I found this one
because it is sometimes hard to find
things that you like it's a sorcerer but
if you look for patterns it makes it a
little bit easier okay the next thing is
a sleep shirt that I got but it just
ended up being something that I wear
around the house all the time and it's
this shirt that has all of these
different caps on it like it says alley
cat little cat tommy cannot fetch at and
it has rips and holes all in it like a
truther shop shirt and thing about this
shirt is it's so long so basically it's
like a t-shirt dress I guess you could
say but it goes past my knees and I have
worn this a lot it's like one of my
favorite things that I have in my closet
it's just so comfy and it makes me laugh
and these are some of my favorite kind
of things to find at restore just like
weird things that you would normally buy
but since it's like $1 it's like why not
and it ends up being your favorite thing
ever
next thing is a miracle that I found
these I feel like because I have been
wanting shoes like this for so long and
they're pretty expensive like at Urban
Outfitters I feel like they're like
$30.00 and when you find things like
this at the thrift store where it's just
like perfect you just get this feeling
in your heart where it's like the
happiest thing ever
so I've worn these a ton and they are so
comfy and I just feel like it's very
rare to find shoes that you like in your
size Epis restore so I was very excited
about these these are like some of the
only shoes that are actually have some
interest or and they were like 2 bucks
the next thing at me and Mark is found
at a local like flea market type thing
and this is a little boy scout bandana
was it actually say this National Boy
Scouts of America and we bought this for
camper but Marcus has actually been
wearing it okay the next 1 2 3 4 5
things are all sweaters and that's
because the thrift store is my favorite
place to buy sweatshirts sweaters any
being oversized I always get from thrift
stores so these are so much that I
picked up recently and here we go first
one is this American flag sweater I was
wearing this in my last get ready with
me video and a lot of you are asking
where I was from and it's from a thrift
shop the brand moment I didn't even
notice the brand is retriever which I
even know that's a brand but I got this
and it's so cute it's a really nice
thick knitted oversized sweater with the
gold American flag on it also got this
sweatshirt from my sister and this
actually had to do a little bit of work
too because it had a big like bleach
stain on it so I think I got this for
like 99 cents but it says veil on it but
I cropped it myself so I cut it like
right where the bleach stain was so now
it's a little cropped sweatshirt okay
and this sweatshirt is one of my
all-time favorites or store finds ever I
wear it all the time and I think it's so
cute the color is just I just love the
sweatshirt so it's the sweatshirt it
says Eddie Bauer on it and Eddie Bauer
of golfing brand I think it might be so
when I found this one is I saw the color
I was looking through the men's
sweatshirts like always and I saw this
like muted like teal green color and I
was like oh that looks amazing you know
those things that you have in your
closet that you're just like you kind of
want to grab it out of your closet and
wear it every single day but you have to
restrain yourself
that's this for me so this is the most
recent purchase I think that I've gotten
from the thrift store and it's this big
oversized knit sweater and the thing
that I loved about the sweater is the
softness it's so soft is thick and
perfect for the winter and I loved the
neck because I just love high necks and
I thought it was really cute how it
ruled like that and it's long so I can
wear it in the winter with leggings
which below and the last sweater is this
one from Calvin
and it's cropped at the bottom and
long-sleeve and it just says Calvin
Klein Jeans and this one is a little bit
different because it's super lightweight
and thin so you can still kind of get
away with wearing this in the summer
also is cropped so it gives you that
extra airiness I just grabbed some of
the stuff that I've recently gotten up
from mr. store for my house and I think
this is just like a vintage on maybe
alcohol bottle
what whoops like it's got like George
Washington on it maybe I take the flour
out of my little rose bush outside and
put that in there and just think it
looks really cute this was a dollar and
I also got this little white full half
pint jar and I have them like sitting
like this on my shelves in my living
room and they're so cute and this one
was also a dollar and they're our best
friends another jar actually have two of
these and they're sitting on one of my
shelves in my living room as well but I
just brought one because they're kind of
huge and it's just this big old jar oh
this is a one gallon jar and I still
haven't taken off the 350 um little
riding has on it this is so sweet I love
this little copper candle holder this I
thought the guy was going to sell it to
me for like at least $10 I thought
because it's real copper in Frayser
but when I asked him how much it was he
said one dollar so that was very happy I
feel like most of these things that I've
gotten have been like one to five
dollars which is just the best part of
the thrift store um but I had been
wanting a little candle holder and I am
obsessed with copper so when I saw this
little guy I was like ah needed and the
last thing that I wanted to show you
guys is um one of like the staple
decorations that I decorated my living
room built-ins with um if you guys have
built-ins in your house which are just
like the shelves that are built in kind
of like next year TV or something like
that you know how hard it is
fill up those shelves so I knew I wanted
to put some books on there but I had
seen on Pinterest a lot of people put
like all white books and it just looks
nice in uniform and I was like how do
people find all of these white books so
then I just wrapped the books in their
own like wrapping but I just flipped it
inside out so then the wrapping would be
white so I have a bunch of these books
from the strip store that I genuinely I
don't even know what books they are
wicked appetite like I don't know put
the flip that means but I just bought a
bunch of hardback book so I could
decorate those shelves with and then I
also bought really cute wrapping paper I
bought this like little polkadot black
wrapping paper and put that on some of
them as well just to mix it up so I have
like these books sitting on my shelf and
they look adorable
so I feel like I've been talking forever
but those are some things that I've
gotten from the thrift store recently
also like little markets around LA so I
really hope that you all enjoyed this
video you guys like their store hauls
and you want me to continue doing them
let me know or give this video a thumbs
up because I seriously probably go to
the store store at least one so we
thought I'd kind of like picking things
up consistently so if you want to see
that let me know and also don't forget
to subscribe to my channel for new
videos every single week
