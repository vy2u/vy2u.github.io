and I am in the weirdest mood right now
I what the heck
there's like a wire hanging in our front
yard what I am just gonna be vlogging
today and just taking you around my day
and who knows what will happen we never
really know what are gonna happen Marcus
is at singing lessons right now and I've
just been picking up around the house
all morning I did an Instagram live get
ready with me and if you guys don't
follow me on Instagram you sure could if
you want it to because I do love doing
Instagram lives and I post pictures just
like everyone else and I think I'm gonna
make myself a little snack right now
because I already ate breakfast but I am
a little bit hungry so I'm gonna make
myself two oranges and if you want an
amazing snack just get yourself some
oranges they're just they're just so so
good and I have it the in oranges and so
long I don't know I just never bought
them except for to make orange juice but
I've just been cutting them up and
eating them as snack this is definitely
not revolutionary but I just
rediscovered my love for oranges I guess
that's what I'm saying
didn't come to see me immediately I was
like I didn't see you in their room like
she's hiding in the room I wasn't scared
Marcus and I just decided we're gonna
brush campers teeth because we brush
them once if his breath smells really
bad right now so let's see if I can even
find this is that special toothpaste for
dogs yeah do they really need that you
think you know what I just realized
I realized that I never updated you guys
about my second piercing like I never
even told you guys if it was healing or
anything really but it's doing great I
really was not very responsible about
keeping up with it like I didn't clean
it twice a day like they told me to but
it's perfectly fine but I'm at altar
right now can you see Ulta because I
want to give myself a little like spa
pamper night tonight my favorite place
how amazing the soap and glory display
is it's so happy that they have this at
Ulta now I'll show you guys everything I
get when I get home I'm also gonna grab
one of my concealers because this is my
favorite concealer and I ran out of it
someone got back I'm also gonna get one
of my razors because camper and honey
shooed mine so I'm gonna grab one of
these has low and I'm gonna get some
cotton rounds because you can never have
too many that's the thing about Oakley
you can get whatever you want in one
place which is amazing
okay got everything I needed from Ulta
now I am going to the thrift store I was
like really debating on whether or not
to but it's only ten minutes away from
here so I'm gonna go there
I'll show you guys inside okay I always
start at the like cups and vases section
because I love finding like jars and
things like that I'm a sucker for
ceramics
this is so cute do a tradition I have is
to find a basket at the thrift store and
then use that to carry around the things
that I find so I found one pretty fast
and this one's really cute I just got
home and I was greeted by camper and he
was so excited and then he just threw up
everywhere and I was just like that's an
amazing way to be creative when you get
back home I just had to clean that up
but I also got this in the mail which
I'm just so happy about look at this
look how cute this backpack is this
brand Salar um sent it to me and I love
it okay I'm gonna take off this little
bits of plastic okay the moment of truth
I'm gonna try it on see if it looks cute
on me it almost looks like in my head it
looks like a little animal because it
has these two spikes up here and then
these two right here like the little
nose and I also love how the straps go
from this middle hook right here I've
never seen anything like that Wow I'm
ready for school
okay I'm gonna show you guys what I got
from Ulta and also what I got from mr.
really quick Canford no barking okay so
the first thing that I got from Ulta are
these soap &amp;amp; Glory visible bath bombs
and I got one in the sugar crush scent
and one in the original beeston and they
look like this these are only five
dollars each which i think is a great
feel and I also got this whipped clean
luxe cream wash shower butter and this
is in the pistachio almond and sweet
vanilla scent which just sounded
incredible and this one was $12 I also
bought this soap and wari sugar crush
cleanse shave and moisturize three and
one xeb body wash Wow this one actually
smells very refreshing like
really smell the lime in it and this one
was $12 as well and the rest of the
things that I got are masks the first
one is one that I'm I think I'm most
excited to try this is the puff I attack
under eye brightening hydrogel patches
and my under eyes are probably my most
troublesome part of my skin just because
they get dry really easily and these
looked like they would be really good to
hydrate underneath them and these are
only five dollars and I thought the
radius boosting mask with vitamin C as
well as the miracle moisture mask so I
basically got all the masks for all the
difference getting from homes and at
these both were at four dollars as well
so I'm very excited about my spa night
tonight because I am completely stocked
up and I also wanted to show you guys
what I got at the thrift store because
it's not a lot of stuff so I ended up
getting this basket I think it's really
cute even till I put a plant in this I
feel like really cute I just want to put
plants and everything and I also got
this which is made in Japan I just
realized that and it's just this little
ceramic ramekin with a handle on it and
you might be thinking Kristin do you
even have a purpose for this and I'm
going to use this for butter because I
don't have any tiny bowls like this to
put butter out when it's dinnertime and
we have like rolls or something like
that so I feel like this would be
perfect for that and I also got this
little what would you call this like
this little mug pot thing it's just such
a unique little ceramic piece and
ceramics are not cheap so I thought four
dollars with a great deal for this and
now I'm gonna go make myself some dinner
because I'm starving and Marcus isn't
here so I'm just gonna heat myself up a
chicken pot pie I'm heating up this
chicken pot pie but it's been in for way
oh are you okay it's been in for way
longer than it says it should be in so
and it still kind of looks not done
does that look done do you guys I
actually decided to cook it more so now
I think it's normal
I'm so glad that
I cooked it so longer because I think
that would have been so we just got home
I'm taking off my makeup really quick
and I don't know if you can hear but I'm
running a bath right now and I'm so
excited I picked out the three things
that I want to use tonight I'll show you
so I'm gonna be using the visible bath
bomb in the smell sugar crush I'm also
gonna be putting these two things on
while I'm in the back I'm going to use
the speed pump moisture mask and these
under-eye brightening mask warning I'm
about to show you myself with a sheet
mask on so don't be scared I wasn't
joking when I said I'd take my spa night
very seriously but I don't know if you
tell but I have the under eye mask on I
have oh I have the moisture mask on look
at this I have the bath ready for me to
get into I even set the candles out to
make it even more of a calm experience
now I'm gonna put in my bath bomb oh I
love that bomb wow I feel so nice and my
skin feels so nice and relaxed and I'm
just ready to curl up in bed but I think
I'm gonna make myself a piece of avocado
toast cuz for some reason I'm craving
that so much and then yesterday I was
craving pickles so much like my mouth
was watering thinking about pickles but
don't worry I'm not pregnant
I have having really weird cravings I
