I feel like I always start my vlogs in
this room maybe it's like a tradition I
have now but today has been a very nice
day so far my mom is in town which is
just the best thing ever so I'm gonna
force her to be in this video today
definitely even though she secretly
likes being in the videos I've just been
cleaning up around the house doing some
work like editing a video we're watching
this little nugget while Lexie and Cody
are in Hawaii you want to say hi no no
this is grover and having three dogs is
just blah Grover it honey
our basically best friends and I think
that they secretly love each other even
though they're cousins
wait that's twisted and I feel like
Cambron honey get worse when we are
watching another dog like I just walked
into my room and I found this this is
like a new journal that I got sent and I
don't know if you're gonna be able to
see but camper destroyed the whole thing
like I'm not gonna be able to use this
and that's really sad
well maybe I can and it can just be like
artsy a little piece of it just fell on
the floor it's really sad and we're also
having a ton of construction on our
house right now basically we're building
a pool in the backyard which is insane
Marcus wanted to build this pool since
the second he saw this house and I was
like okay just go ahead and do it so
he's been the total one and control of
this let me just show you what our
backyard looks like it's let me just
show you this is our backyard guys look
at that that's gonna be the pool and
it's just all dirt out there it's pretty
loud because they'll it constantly
jackhammering and digging holes and I
think it'll be done in like a month and
a half so that'll be nice but throughout
the vlog if you hear some some
interesting noises it's probably
it's around two o'clock now I haven't
eaten it so I'm real hungry so I'm gonna
take care of that very soon it's
treacherous oh my gosh
hello titi Marcus has been editing this
video I don't know if it's gonna be up
by the time that I post this but he
taught me how to off-road but I'll link
it down below if it's not if it is up
and I'll I'll I'll link it to my blog
she wants to put some lipstick up okay
I'm gonna make some lunch now and I have
three things to choose from I'll show
you what I'm talking about this is what
I'm talking about I'm gonna be using
hellofresh today to make my lunch so we
have some pasta which I actually had
pasta last night so probably won't make
that one but we also have southwestern
stuffed peppers and also balsamic big
chicken which my friend actually just
got in there hello fresh order and they
were telling me it's really good so this
is the one I'm kind of leaning towards
okay yeah I think I'm gonna do this one
so if you guys don't know what
hellofresh is it's a meal delivery
service which basically delivers you all
the ingredients you need to make certain
meals so I'll show you guys what's
inside I've used hellofresh so many
times and I think that the biggest thing
for me which makes it so helpful is just
the fact that it has the recipe laid out
and all of like the perfect amounts of
ingredients because I think that's the
thing that's the hardest for me at the
grocery store is like I buy a ton of one
thing and it ends up going to waste
which I hate so this gives you the
perfect amount of ingredients so in this
we got some spring mix lettuce
we also have some rosemary I can just
see you picking out an address I also
have I think these are yeah these are
sweet potatoes is this a shallot mom or
is this an onion is this a tiny onion
just a shallot some chicken Oh some
sauce some thick Jam oh my gosh this is
the cutest little jar definitely gonna
save this and some balsamic vinegar and
a woman gotta get that you can add for
it really quick here is what the eat
meals gonna look like balsamic big
chickens I love anything fig
the meal is almost ready we've only been
cooking for honestly five minutes and
it's almost all done which is the best
part about it just like you don't have
to be in the kitchen for an hour cooking
you can just get it done have a healthy
good meal so fast and easy and it's so
fun to do together yeah it's so fun
together and when I order hellofresh I
always get the classic box but they also
have a veggie box and a family box which
i think is really nice for people that
are vegetarian or people that have a
bigger family but these meals are
usually perfect size for me markets or
today I am on say from start to finish
30 minutes 25 minutes really not bad at
all this is the sauce the think sauce
okay here is the balsamic fig chicken
this is honestly it looks like one of
the best hello fresh meals I've ever
made it's just everything about it looks
so good I had to come back in this room
because look my lipstick got demolished
so if you guys want $30 off of your
first week of hellofresh
you can go to hell afresh calm and use
my code at Kristen John's 30 I look for
something Oh tiny bit more subdued than
the ones that I have and before this one
is actually from covergirl you got
something on it um this is their melting
pout matte lipstick in the shade what's
your shade champagne showers and I don't
really have a ton of makeup from
covergirl but I really like this color
and I'm also gonna prop you up a little
bit first I wanted to show you guys
really quick how I've been doing my hair
lately and it's so easy so I just wanted
to show you really quick so I have these
two little hair bows from Urban
Outfitters that I've been using a lot
I'm gonna wear this one today and I just
take my hair like that and then I take a
tiny little section about that much
and I just bunch it up right here like
this and then I take this part and I
don't pull all the hair through I just
pull a tiny button through can you see
that and then I fix the bow to where it
looks a little normal and voila
pretty much then I usually pull a tiny
bit of hair out and that's how I've been
wearing my hair and like every single
day lately I didn't want to make my lips
a tiny bit darker it just to make like
perfect lines on my lips and my lip
artist yeah I like that a little bit
better okay so me and my mom are gonna
take the dogs to the pool because they
need to get some exercise in Camberwell
but honey
doesn't she shake before she even look
she wants me to go in
look I'll throw a camper ball ready
we're heading home now
the dogs are tired out finally hopefully
hopefully they're calmer than they have
been we've had a little moment we had to
sink blow up yeah the sink blew up and
with carrots and potato peels but
everywhere no yes but it's okay cuz I
cleaned it up okay my mom was right
my mom was right it was just our
dysfunctional sink but while we're
waiting to get hungry we're gonna do
something naughty yes because I I told
Lexi I would wait for her to get back
but and she told my dad that you'd wait
but we really want to watch season two
handmade so I think we're just gonna do
it guys just won by the way if you lose
your Apple remote a lot just put it on a
little food okay we're ready
that's why I'm nervous yeah life hack
wait wait I'm about to edit this video
and I just remembered that I have like
some footage from when I threw Marcus a
surprise party for his birthday if you
don't follow me on instagram you
probably didn't know that I did that but
I did vlog some of it and like I've
logged his reaction and everything like
that so I'm gonna stick that little part
in here really quick okay I thought that
you guys would like that guys I'm
currently drawing Marcus a surprise
party and he's gonna be here in like two
minutes
and so I was like I probably should have
logged this for the memory so oh my gosh
I'm gonna film it on my phone too
I'm so nervous baybel
and that made me think the birthday
party is one time I was like person I'd
like to do something but then oddly
people have been very like
I fell asleep last night and forgot in
the vlog so good morning and good
morning from camper I wanted to show you
guys this before I end the vlog I made
homemade oh it kind of it seems like
it's kind of working
okay I tried to make homemade coconut
yogurt ablai the only things that are in
here are full fat coconut milk a little
bit of maple syrup a little bit of
vanilla extract and two probiotic
capsules I emptied out so at first they
were like totally liquidy and now it's
been almost 48 hours this one seems like
it's not setting up as well as this one
this one is a Trader Joe's brand coconut
milk and this one is like a Ralph's
brand so we'll see because it hasn't
been a total of 48 hours yet it's a
little bit less than that so I'll let
you guys know how this goes and I'll
link the recipe down below and I miss my
plan some time with my mom so I hope you

misting on camera but this is a very
important part of my morning I hope you
