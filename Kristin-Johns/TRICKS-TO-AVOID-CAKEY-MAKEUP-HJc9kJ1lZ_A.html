some of my favorite tips to keeping your
makeup looking super natural still like
pretty and glowy but less cakey this
video is like to expel the cakiness
thank you very much so something that I
really try to stay away from is super
heavy looking makeup I know that like
the full coverage glam is super popular
right now and it really does look
beautiful on camera but I feel like when
it comes to day to day life it's really
nice to have your natural skin shining
through and to not have like a full mask
of makeup on on the day to day and I
feel like I was kind of starting to just
accidentally use too much foundation use
a full coverage foundation every single
day when I really didn't mean to and
it's happy to let your natural skin show
through a lot and my first tip has to be
about the base that you're using because
I feel like natural makeup always starts
with your skin so what I've been using
lately is this this is a new product
from first abt it's the ultra Repair
tinted moisturizer I use this today in
the shade medium and what I love about
this is that it's so moisturizing and
luminous
it really lets your natural skin shine
through it looks super glowy and I also
love that it's super fast and easy to
apply you don't have to be blending
forever I actually like to use this with
my fingers and then it just gives me
like a really nice glowy look and I know
that my skin's gonna be protected
because it has SPF 30 in it so this
would be my first tip just getting
something that's gonna let your skin
shine through and this one has been my
favorite one that I found so far and tip
number two would be used less powder and
use your powder with your damp Beauty
Blender now that I use less powder on a
day to day basis I feel like my skin
looks a lot more skin like and
especially using it with the immunity
Blender it really just melts it into
your skin and it just applies it in the
most beautiful way and since I have
using the damp Beauty Blender with
powder for so long I was like I'm just
gonna try putting on my powder with just
a regular brush and it was the biggest
difference my skin it just looked like
it had powder sitting on top of it so it
was like okay I'm like a firm believer
in the damn teeny blender plus powder so
that is definitely something else that
has really been keeping my skin looking
more natural
okay this third tip is actually
something that I just discovered kind of
more recently and I have been using
setting sprays for a while but I feel
like I was using them wrong at least for
me I would always put all my setting
spray and the very last amended after
mascara after my eyes I went to spray my
whole face and it was so annoying
because my mascara would always transfer
to the top of my eyelid so I started
using my setting spray just after I
finished my face makeup and I'm about to
move on to my eye makeup so that I don't
get mascara transfer and even sometimes
it would mess up my eyeliner it would be
very annoying and sometimes I would be
like okay I hate setting spray but that
has definitely been something that has
helped so much and I haven't really
always been a huge setting spray user
like sometimes I would just skip it
because I just didn't think it was super
important but once I started looking
closer I could really tell a difference
of when I would use setting spray and
when I wouldn't okay tip number four
might be my favorite tip of them all and
this is actually a Korean beauty tip
that I learned on Instagram it is to
take a more bright helicopter
but it is to take a brighter lipstick so
this is just like a hot pink shade and
take it over at moisturize lips and just
put it right in the center of your lips
and then to Pat it in with your finger
and you can do this tip with any color
lipstick it doesn't have to be like a
bright one but I feel like it looks like
prettiest with a brighter shade and it
kind of looks like that really pretty
like summer staying color and I just
like this tip because I feel like a lot
of the time when you put on especially
like a cream lipstick it can just look
like a whole nother layer of lips you
know what I'm saying like it really sits
there but with this I find that it lasts
longer and it looks a little bit more
natural and fresh what's another word
for fresh I'm gonna have to google that
really quick because I feel like I'm
saying fresh a lot mint modern useful
you feel good where it looks a little
bit more youthful when you just dab it
on instead of putting a thick layer on
your lips okay so the last tip tip
number 5 is after you finish doing your
whole face of makeup after your setting
spray after everything take your damp
Beauty Blender and just run it all over
your face and this will just make sure
that you don't have any harsh lines any
harsh lines from your highlighter any
harsh lines from your bronzer and I
never ever ever skip this step because I
have realized so many times when I'm
doing this step how much of a difference
it made because either I have like a
stripe of powder right here that just
looked really weird or my bronzer with a
little bit too harsh and this always
fixes it basically the Beauty Blender is
like the makeup version of a magic
eraser so I just love using this and
this is like one of the steps that I
will never skip like I love doing this
because it seriously makes a huge
difference and I just have to say if you
are feeling like you just don't have the
best skin or you feel embarrassed to not
wear a lot
make up or you feel like full-coverage
foundations are like your crutch I have
felt like that before and I felt like oh
I definitely need to put on some
foundation before I go out and I really
challenged myself and I was like well
just go out and wear no makeup or wear a
little bit of a tinted moisturizer and
just like be confident with what your
skin looks like even if you have pimples
all over your face
I think that's totally fine I just
wanted to say that because I feel like
that's something that I definitely could
have found helpful so yeah I hope you
