out some Instagram beauty trends or
Instagram beauty hacks and I'm very
nervous and I'm very excited because
sitting in front of me is achievable
asami a pair of scissors a Beautyblender
singh and a bunch of other strange
things that you wouldn't normally
associate makeup with I am going to be
trying out these trends that I found on
Instagram I'm sure all of you guys know
Instagram is a place that you can find
anything and especially when it comes to
beauty there's so many pages that do
DIYs and different beauty hacks and
stuff like that so I wrote down a few
that I wanted to try today and I'm
really I'm really excited to see if they
really do work or not I'm going to go
wash my face because I'm starting with a
clean slate day because we're going from
foundation to lipstick so who really is
going to happen okay I'm back my face is
all clean no makeup on and the first
hack is to cut a beauty sponge in half
and then apply your foundation with it
that way so this this whole hack is
supposed to make your foundation be able
to reach all the corners and around your
nose by your eyes around your mouth a
lot easier so let's see if this works
and this is a real techniques sponge I
never really use this one because I like
my regular Beauty Blender a little bit
better so I don't feel so bad cutting in
half but also I do still feel bad I'm
just going to take my scissors feels so
bad I feel like so old sponge okay I'm
just going to do it 3 2 1 cutting it's
cutting I have a very flat surface of
the sponge and you're supposed to pump
your foundation on top of there and then
apply it like that so I have my few face
for display in the shade nude pump some
of that on there let's see if this works
mmm seems nice
well I kind of like that it's smaller it
kind of makes it feel like you're more
in control so that's good and it doesn't
seem to be making it patchy or anything
like that which I was kind of scared of
okay so this is making it more precise
um like the way the foundation is going
on you have more control of where it's
going but also it's taking longer you
know because like regularly you could
use this whole thing but not it is using
this little thing now I'm going to try
it with some concealer and see how that
works so I'm just going to put some
right underneath my eyes and see if the
little the little baby blender makes
everything a little bit easier you know
what I think this would be helpful with
I think it would be helpful if you had
done your eyeshadow and it got a little
bit more down here than you wanted and
then you just wanted to take your
concealer and kind of you know clean up
the edge to make it a little bit sharper
I think that this would be a lot easier
than just using like this more fat tips
and you can use your little skinny edge
I think that that would be very helpful
I'm just not realizing that the Real
Techniques sponge already has a more
flat side to it so now that I'm looking
at it it kind of looked the same but I
feel like if you are using a sponge that
has more of those round edges and then
the regular tips that look like this and
you didn't like it maybe cutting in half
would be helpful but maybe for this one
you can just use this side and it's like
the exact same set but I really do like
this little tiny nugget of a Beauty
Blender and now I'm going to see how it
applies powder so for powder today this
is actually going to be another little
hack that I'm going to try out so I'm
gonna take my Laura Mercier powder and
I'm trying that water technique what is
it called I know there's a specific name
for it but it's where you put powder all
of your face like a very generous amount
there and stick your head in a bowl of
cold water for 30 seconds and it's
supposed to lock in your foundation and
keep it like matte and beautiful all day
so I'm going to try that out okay so my
face is officially um powdered to the
extreme my little blending that get did
a very good job at applying it evenly
and heavily so now I'm going to take
this bowl of water I'm ready and
prepared on the futile ice in it but the
ice melted so we're just going to say
it's okay I'm going to stick my face in
the water I look so crazy in the
descender well okay I'm gonna stick my
face in the water for 30 seconds okay
ready 3 2 1 oh it feels very strange to
faceplant into water let me just tell
you okay five more seconds okay okay I'm
done
and let's see if I are aware okay so I
just unsub might look very very pale but
the powder is still on my face you can
see like right there to get very wet so
the powder is still on but you're
supposed to let it air dry and then
you're supposed to wipe away the powder
with a powder brush so I'll be right
back when the water is dried off my face
okay see you in a second one thing I
will say about this specific act is that
I feel like if someone walked in on you
with your head in a bowl of water or
like your head in the bathtub they would
be like very concerned about your
well-being so I would warn your friends
and family what you're doing because
Marcus just walked in and he's like why
are you showing yourself with your head
in a bucket so that's one thing to be
warned about it so I think my face is
completely dry now a lemon so you can
kind of see how my skin looks kind of
weird and powdery I'm going to take a
big fluffy brush and wipe all the powder
off
my face but my skin feels very very soft
and it looks very matte like there's
like no shine at all on my face so I'm
going to go and do the rest of my face
makeup and we'll be back to try the
other hat so all of my face makeup went
on very smooth very nice I wish you
could feel my skin if you saw I just
looked up what this is technically
called and it's kind of like a little
rubber ball it's technically called the
Jim you mess it but it's supposed to
make your makeup stay on longer and it's
supposed to make it transfer fruit so I
have this little towel and I'm just
going to see if I run if I run this over
it if it comes off and there's a little
bit of transfer I rubbed it very lightly
like if you were taking off your shirt
or something not like actually trying to
rub it off so there is a tiny bit of
transfer but I'm sure it would be a lot
more if I hadn't done this
Gansu method the next thing I'm going to
do I'm just going to do the rest of my
eye makeup and then I have a few lip
tricks that I'm very nervous about so
I'll be right back the second black hat
but I have involved this and this is a
tube of wasabi
I just went to Publix and I bought it it
was like $1.99 and this is that they go
on my lips and I found this trick from
this girl her name is Sarah
Duke hi I think that's how I say it I'll
put it right here but she says that this
is natural lip fillers which I know lip
colors are all the rage these days I'm
pretty fine with my lips I don't really
want what fillers but I thought this
would be a fun hack to try because it
makes your lips look plumper and she
said it takes out all the lines of your
lips wrinkle free whips so I'll show you
guys a little before of my lips so we
can get a before and after shot but this
is my regular lips this is without any
moisturizer they're supposed to be like
clean nothing on them so I have
my clean whip and you take a little bit
it says tiny amount so I'm going to take
a tiny amount on my lip and rub it
around okay I've been really nervous for
this one okay
you rub it on leave this one minute okay
here we go
okay I'm so scared I feel it I feel the
burn definitely burning that's for sure
I don't want to get any of this in and
out close it church budge you guys I'm
serious this is burning like a crazy it
feels like I just stuck my lips on a
pepper okay keep rubbing it in okay okay
timers on take your dance washcloth and
wipe it off oh it didn't help Adam
enough well okay and then it says to
moisturize immediately after so I have
some aqua for oh wow let's see I'll do a
little zoom in so you can see the before
and after okay so here is the after of
my lips it does look a little bit
plumper okay so I can't say that that
did so much I feel like maybe it gave it
a little bit more plumpness to my lips
but I would say maybe if you're really
really wanting just a little bit of
extra plumpness try wasabi but I'm just
warning you this is my warning it does
burn a lot one last little hack but it's
not really a hack because it's not
really something I found on Instagram
but I just always wanted to do it and
it's to create your own lipstick using
lipsticks that you already have but
don't use that much wait let me zoom out
and I'm talking so zoomed in okay so the
three lipsticks I'm going to be using
today to make my own lipstick shade are
two for match this one is brave
and it's a really pretty color but I
don't find that I use it too much like
it's almost a little bit too pink for me
so and I use a little bit of this I'm
also going to mix in
some of Mac's neon orange I don't really
use this one that left IDO just because
it is such a bold color but I love the
warmth of it so I'm thinking that the
warmth of this color is going to make
this color a little bit more suitable
for me and then I'm also going to mix in
some of bite pepper and pepper is just
like my perfect shade but it got all
like melted and disgusting so I'm going
to add some of that in there and then
I'm going to microwave them all together
mix it up and then pour it into a little
like eyeshadow pot okay and for my
little container that I'm going to put
my lipstick in I'm going to use this
little jar it's just like an old Mac
eyeliner that was all dried out so I
just emptied it out and so I'm going to
put my little homemade lipstick in here
and then I'm going to take all of my
lipsticks that I want to add into this
and I'm just going to put them in this
little Bowl so first I'm going to take
bites pepper and I'm going to put it in
the bowl let me show you guys down a
little bit she maybe you should use a
different utensil but that's all I got
and also I saw that bite has this thing
in New York where you can make your own
lipstick so this is like the homemade
version of that so then I'm going to
take max brave and some scissors and cut
it this feels very wrong but you can
still use it after you cut it so I don't
feel so bad
okay I cut off about that much and I'm
going to put that in there I'm going to
take my max me on orange and I'm also
going to cut that very satisfied and I
have no idea what this color is going to
look like it might be very strange I am
NOT a makeup connected but here is what
the colors look like all together okay
so I just got back from the microwave
and here is the color that those three
colors made I think it looks very
beautiful it's like a very pretty coral
color I'll do a little swatch for you
guys on
and I'm also visited on but it's very
beautiful look oh my gosh I actually
really think that this color is nice Wow
such a pretty color I really actually
like it it's kind of like a wearable
Coralie mauve color and it's kind of
bright but also kind of subdued so wow I
actually really really like it I'm so
surprised
if you guys have any ideas for names in
this color I am open to suggestions I'll
write it on my little bottom of my jar
I'm gonna put this in and I'll put it on
snapchat and you will know that you
named my first ever custom lipstick
color but if you have some lipstick
laying around that you don't really wear
that often or you just have some colors
that you know you only wear like once or
twice a year I would definitely suggest
mixing it with some other colors and
just creating your own it's kind of fun
to be creative I have so much fun so in
