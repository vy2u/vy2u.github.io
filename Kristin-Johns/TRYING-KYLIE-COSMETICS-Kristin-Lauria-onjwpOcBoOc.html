blinking hey guys today I am so excited
to finally be filming a new video let me
just say this past week has been so
insane if you don't follow me on
snapchat and Twitter I'm sure you have
no idea what I'm talking about
but the past nine days our power has
been completely out so that means no AC
no Wi-Fi no lights so I could not film a
video for you guys and it's just been
really crazy but today as you can
probably tell from the title it's a
pretty exciting video I got some little
packages in the mail and you guys
probably know what's in here they are
from Kylie cosmetics what the box looks
like the box that I've seen on so many
pictures and instagrams and blah blah
blah I got the cash shadow palette and
also the Kylie um matte liquid lipstick
lip kits and Kristin I had to get the
women Kristin even though it's not
spelled the right way I still had to get
the one without my name and then I got
the shade ginger and I haven't tried
them at all because I just wanted it to
be a real first impression that first
try out so I'm so excited to finally
open them I think what I'm going to do
is I'm going to put them on I'm going to
put on the eyeshadow and try on both of
the lip kits and then I'm going to take
you with me throughout my day and just
show you how I'm liking them how they're
wearing and then at the end of the day
I'll just tell you my final opinions the
first thing I'll try out is the
eyeshadow palette I did my whole face
and makeup except for my eye shadow and
my lips so this is the Kylie hi shadow
palette I love the name how she made it
hi shadow a thing of things that you
could do with Kristin and then I thought
of Kristin inspiration so this is what
the palette looks like I actually
watercolor to picture like
my sophomore year of high school if I
can find a picture of that I will put it
right here but it's just a weird kids
like exactly like this but this is what
it looks like it has some really nice
warm shades in there mostly matte which
I love I love matte colors and then you
have two little shimmers right there the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to take the shade Jasper which is the
white creamy matte shade and I'm just
going to put that all over my lid and
that seems really pigmented to me there
is a lot of like powder that comes off
of it but I'm just going to tap that off
and what this is very pigmented and I'm
going to go in with the shade topaz
which is the top right matte brown shade
and I'm going to put that in my face now
I'm going to take this orange color and
I'm going to just put that a little bit
in the crease below where I put that
first matte brown color just to you know
warm it up a little bit now I'm going to
take the color Goldstone on my finger
because I just like using my finger for
more shimmery eyeshadows and I'm just
going to take a little bit of that and
put that on the outer part of my lid and
this eyeshadow is pigmented but you have
to go I think more back and forth into
the pan onto your brush or your finger
to get probably like the full amount of
color that you would want now I'm going
to take the shade quartz which is the
light shimmery champagne color and I'm
going to put that near my inner corners
this one seems a little bit more
pigmented than Goldstone but kind of in
a different way like this ones I think
less shimmery than gold eye what is it
Goldstone now I'm going to take this
little precise brush by Real Techniques
and I'm going to take Goldstone and I'm
going to run that underneath my eye and
I'm also going to use this little
precision brush and take the shade
bronze eye which is the dark matte brown
and I'm kind of going to use this as
like a smokey eyeliner okay so I just
finished with the eye shadow and
I actually really really like how it
turned out I'm not a professional makeup
artist I'm not like a huge like makeup
guru or anything like that but I would
have to say for like your regular
average girl I feel like this is a
really nice I shadow palette because
it's super easy to work with and there
wasn't any fallout I didn't have any
issues with fallout the only thing is
that it does get powdery when you put
your brush in it I don't know if you can
see that but it kicks up a lot of powder
which can just be annoying I don't know
if I would say it's like the highest
quality eyeshadow in the whole wide
world
but I feel like it is really easy to
work with and it does create an easy I
shadow look if that's what you want
let's try out the lip kits and I'm so
excited first I'll try the shade Kristin
I've heard so much about these things
and isn't it kind of weird when you've
heard so much about something and then
you finally get it and you're just like
wait you should be an Instagram right
now you should be in my house so I'm
just going to start with the lip liner
and it seems like a nice like muted rose
color so let's just try it
okay so the lipliner is on it felt
really creamy and easy to go on so good
job now for the real test wow that
smells way different than I thought it
would it smells
yeah like really sweet but also kind of
like medicine a little bit
okay so now that the lipstick is
completely dry I really do like this
color it's a little bit different than
what I thought it would be I don't know
why I thought it was going to be more of
a mauve color but it's more of like a
reddish pink but I really do like it and
it dried down so fast I haven't tried a
ton of liquid lipsticks but this one
seems like a good one but now I'm going
to wipe this color off and try the shade
ginger that's the other shade I had um
oh okay now that shade is off and my
lips are officially the most exfoliated
you've ever been because I was rubbing
them so hard with this okay
so now let's try the other shade which
seems a little bit more warm like a warm
ginger color so that's called ginger
okay so first I'm going to put on the
lip liner and fill in my lips ooh I
think I'm gonna like this color okay so
there is the lip liner on and now I'm
going to put on the ginger Kylie lip kit
lip liquid hello it feels very nice okay
now this is ginger all dried and I like
this color I don't know if I would
choose this color regularly because it's
kind of like a warm toned brown color
it's kind of brown but I am going to
wear it throughout the rest of the day
as well as my eye shadow and I'm gonna
give you some check-ins I don't know if
I told you guys this or not but I am
going to a football game today so we
will see if it really stands the test
and the heat and I forgot to tell you
guys it is 1055 right now so I will see
you guys in a little bit so we're
walking to the game now how does
everyone like Mike
we make us love it wretch cute beauty
do you like a shadow better or the
lipstick lips and I shot it
both yeah turn out hi I'd say equal I
got the roommates approval so that's
good
just left the game it's honestly feels
like 150 oh it's a hundred I can't
believe how good this lipstick is it's
still on really the only part that's
paid off is right here but it still
feels comfy not drying very nice a plus
my gosh even the eyeshadow is still long
I'm not even joking right now I would
have to say ten out of ten so oppressed
my lips aren't all dried out
my eyeshadows still on and we were
literally in the Sahara Desert so thumbs
up hey guys I am back from the football
game we got lunch we got smoothies as
you could tell I was dying of heat what
time is it
it's 251 so I've had this on since
lapooh
I've had this song for like four hours
and usually I would go longer throughout
the day showing you guys kind of how it
wears and stuff but I honestly feel like
I have completely put this makeup
through the ringer I was sweating like
dripping sweat my hair looks insane it
wasn't a braid but now I don't even know
what's happening and I just know that
this was like the biggest test that I
could have put this makeup through and
so I have some final thoughts that I
want to share with you guys first of all
it looked really great up until I ate
lunch so obviously it kind of wore off
right in the middle but still on the
outside it does still look like not
horrible in the eye shadow I'm so
impressed with its still pretty much all
on and usually when I do eyeshadow as my
eyeliner it's gone within like the first
few hours I'm just so impressed I was
honestly a little bit nervous about this
because I've deterred so many mixed
reviews so many people hate it so many
people love it so I was just really
curious to what I would think but
honestly I think that I really really
like it
so I won't reapply it using the lipliner
but I'll just put the ginger liquid
lipstick over top of what I already have
and just see kind of what happens okay
so now it's drying down more and you can
see it looks like completely fine when
you reapply it over like left over some
focus but when you apply it over like
already lipstick lips I would have to
say that my overall opinion of these is
that I really do like them I would
recommend them if you find a color that
you love and that you know that you'll
probably wear a lot I do think that
they're worth it because they really do
stay on really well they're comfortable
they're lightweight they don't throw out
your lips so that's kind of like
everything that you would want from
liquid lipsticks so I really do like
these and I would definitely get more
colors of them and then for the
eyeshadow palette I still do really like
this and I think that I'll be reaching
for it a lot just because like I said
it's a ton of colors that I already like
to use every single day and it's like
all in one palette so that's really nice
if I had to choose between the lip
products and the eyeshadow palette I'd
probably choose the lip products I hope
