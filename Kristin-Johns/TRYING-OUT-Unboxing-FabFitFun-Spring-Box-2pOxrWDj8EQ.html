you what is in the spring fabfitfun box
and isn't this a very cute box I love
this one if you haven't followed my
channel for a while you might not know
what fabfitfun is it's a subscription
box like I said but it's a little bit
different it's not a monthly
subscription box it comes every season
so it comes four times a year usually
what I do is I wait till I get the box
and then I unboxed it all for you and I
didn't know what's in the box but this
month I wanted to do something a little
bit different and I actually already
opened the box and I've seen what's
inside and I have already used most of
the products or I'm going to try it on
camera day just so you can kind of see
like many reviews of each thing and I
just thought that that might be a little
bit more helpful than like a regular
unboxing so let me know which way you
like better to say I like when all of
the prize or if you like when I've tried
everything and this is what the box
looks like for spring very exciting so
the first thing I'll show you guys is
this and this is the dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion age defying exfoliator
and I've already tried this out and I
really did like it this retails for $79
and the say my skin feel very soft and
made it feel very clean I don't know if
it made my skin more young-looking
I can't really say anything about the
age defying factor because I only used
it two different times but I'm sure it's
good to use age defying things when
you're young you have to start young and
the next thing in here is also good for
your skin but it's also good for your
hair and your nails and these are
gummies with biotin in them and they're
from the brand at nature's bounty this
is just like a little added bonus like
this doesn't add too like the cost of
your box but they're just full of
gummies and I have always been curious
about taking vitamin because I never
have before
oh it says you can take two a day so I'm
going to try to right now on camera so I
can tell you guys if they're delicious
or not that could be dangerous because
these actually taste like candy
but you're only chose to take two a day
but I will happily eat these every day
this next thing
actually haven't tried yet because when
I got the box I already had my nails
painted and gel polish so I didn't want
to take that off but this is a little
deborah lippmann little nail polish set
and I got the set that has like all
really pretty creamy white color and a
pink color but I've never used a Deborah
Lippmann nail polish before but I heard
that they're like a very fancy very nice
so this is what the shades look like
definitely shades that are right up my
alley and perfect for the spring so I'm
really excited about these and also
something that's good about little sized
nail polishes is that and can take them
traveling with you easier oh and I
didn't tell you how much these retail
for these retail for $19 the next thing
is here is a leave-in conditioning spray
that I used last night and this is by
the brand Bree oh gee oh and it's called
Road Arco milk
reparative leave-in conditioning spray
this retails for $20 and this is kind of
like a double whammy because it also
says that it acts as a barrier against
heat which i think is really nice
because it's like conditioning your hair
but also if you use heat on your hair
everyday it will kind of be like your
heat protectant that you already have in
your hair cause it's believed in
conditioner so next thing in here is
from the brand emerald emerald dove it's
a bracelet and this retails for $80 Wow
and this is what it looks like it's just
a really cute gold cuff let me slip that
on my wrist wow it's very cute
here's what it looks like it's really
cute I love the design how it just has a
very simple line this next thing I'm
very excited about I haven't opened it
yet because I want to do it on camera
and this is the Gipsy Roundy which is a
really cute name I guess you can really
use this as anything it says you can
even use it as a tapestry if you wanted
to hang it on your wall so that's pretty
cool so I'll stand up and show you guys
what it looks like all unfolded here's
what it looks like it's very very
beautiful it's like a pretty tie-dyed
and it's round in a huge see there the
the next thing here is something that
I'm very excited to use because I
haven't used it yet but I love sheet
masks and this is by the brand
Karuna and these are hydrating face
masks they retail for $28 there's four
in here here's what they look like and I
like I said I love sheet masks so I'm
very excited to use these these are for
dry dull or dehydrated skin which I feel
like my skin is leaning more on the dry
side and now that I've moved out to
California and these are going to be
very very helpful we're down to the last
few things in here I have not opened
this but I think it's really cute this
is a little makeup bag or a pencil bat
or whatever you want to use it as and it
says lay all day and if you like slay
the word that a lot of people use these
days but I haven't really gotten into
the slay vocabulary yet but I'm going to
feel like a very trendy girl with my
little slay all day makeup bag and the
final thing and this box is this little
little package and this is like a
lipstick set and it says on the front I
am fabulous it is the shade of my lip
products they're like all very deep dark
red which I love and I'm gonna be trying
them on camera three back today so Wow
these are actually very cute look how
cute this is
please focus it's like engraved in there
and it says real her and then just all
the packaging is very cute this one this
little cube shaped one is actually a
liquid lipstick this one is a lip gloss
and this one is a lip liner so I'm going
to be using the liquid lipstick and the
lip liner today oh my gosh that's creamy
Wow
this is the creamiest lip liner I've
ever used in my life I'm not even joking
I just applied the lip liner and this is
what it looks like it's definitely not a
perfect application but I really really
love this color
I'm telling you guys this lip liner is
amazingly premium well so this is what's
the color of to get lip liner plus the
liquid lipstick looks like I think it's
a really really perfect classic like
American red shade which I really like
and it's like cool blue undertones so
it's making my teeth with white which is
very nice and I'm not going to put on
the lip gloss today because I really
like how it looks matte but I'll give
you a little swatch Wow
very pigmented and this set retails for
$48 so the total retail value of the box
depending on what you got in your box
because there's always like a little bit
of variation between the boxes is either
three hundred sixty nine dollars to
three hundred and seventy four dollars
so if you compare that the fifty dollars
that you spend on the box you're getting
way way way more worse than what you
spent which is what I like to hear if
you guys are interested in getting the
string box you can use my coupon code
Kristin for $10 off so you can save some
money and if you did like this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and like always I'm so happy that I got
to partner with FAFSA fun for this video
they really are an amazing company
amazing people work for them so they get
all my love and support but I love you
guys I will see you very soon and have a
great rest today
