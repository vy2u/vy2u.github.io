on camera and you're making gross noises
hi guys today I'm so excited for this
video because I'm going to be showing
you probably the cutest makeup I've ever
seen in my entire life it's by a brand
called Paul &amp;amp; Joe cosmetics and you've
probably seen some pictures of them
online they're the makeup brand that has
like the cat lipsticks and the cat
blushes and I have never seen anyone
review Paul and Joe cosmetics on YouTube
or online or really anything so I wanted
to buy some of it so that I can show you
how it works see if it's just cute and
it doesn't really work
or maybe it's really good makeup so if
you want to see if it's a thumbs-up or a
thumbs-down then just keep watching
so the first makeup product that I'm
going to try out from this line is
called their perfect makeup primer and I
just love the packaging that everything
comes in I just think it's so cute and
vintagey so I got the shade 0 - this
line doesn't really have a ton of color
options but this is what it looks like
all of their packaging guys is just mmm
it couldn't be better
I love their packaging so much so I'm
guessing this is just going to be a
clear primer let's see what it looks
like oh it actually has some color to it
so let me try that on my face that's so
weird that it has color to it because I
feel like usually makeup primers are
just kind of clear so that's pretty
interesting so I'm just going to rub
that in with my fingers so this primer
actually does have a little bit of
covered dinner I feel like this would be
nice for a day that you don't really
feel like wearing on my proper
foundation this would just be easy and
fast to throw on and it feels really
soft on my skin it sink in really fast
so that's really nice so the next day I
got is
datian this is the pollen Joe
silky-smooth foundation and this one
also has SPF in it and this one has SPF
28 and I made a big mistake with this
one because it is way way too light for
my skin so I got the shade one zero one
and again they don't really have a huge
variety of colors so I didn't really
know which one to get and this is just
way too white so I'm not going to be
able to use the foundation but just from
putting it on my hand it seems like it
has like a nice texture to it it's not
too like sticky or thick but I can't
really tell you guys how it works
because it would make me look like a
ghost so today for my foundation I'm
just going to be mixing my favorite Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation and I'll
be able to see if the primer makes it go
on any different than it usually does
because I use this foundation every
single day so I honestly feel like my
foundation looks really really nice
right now like almost more just even
than it usually does and I think that is
because of the primer which is really
cool so I think I'm definitely going to
keep using this it's really nice and it
also is going to have your SPF in it so
that's nice too so I would give this a
thumbs up right now Halling Joe did not
have a concealer that I could find so
I'm just going to be using my good old
Naked skin by urban decay concealer and
I'm using the color light neutral okay
so the next thing I'm going to do is set
my face with some powder so it came in
this huge box way way bigger than I was
expecting
like I think it's my face and this is
what the powder container looks like
it's this huge glorious powder box that
you just put on your vanity and it comes
off like that and then it has a little
powder puff and just so dang cute I know
that this packaging isn't for everybody
but grandma vintagey cute girly
packaging is totally my style
another thing about pollen Jo is that
you usually buy the container and the
product separately so
when you run out of the product you just
have to buy the refill which is really
nice and it honestly smells a little bit
like a grandma but you know like a
trendy grandma like a grandma that wears
like kind of young perfume but is still
a grandma so I'm just going to take a
little bit of this powder on this powder
puff I'm feeling very much like a lady
and I'm just gonna dot that all over my
face well it just feels very nice like
I'm patting a bunny all over my face so
I really really like this powder it's
making my skin feel so soft um the one
thing that's bad about this I guess is
that you can't travel with it because it
would explode everywhere but if you're
looking for just the cutest little
powder put on your desk this one is so
nice Paul and Joe didn't have any
bronzer so I'm just going to be using
benefits who love this is one that I use
all the time and I love it so much okay
so the next product might be the cutest
out of everything it's this blush and it
has these little cats all over it I'll
make sure to zoom in so you guys can
really see what it looks like but it's
just so cute it makes me so happy
looking at it so this is what it looks
like and when you open it up it has a
little puff with a yellow bow on it and
then on the inside it's these little
balls that have actual cat figurines in
them so the little cats inside are
actually blush I mean it just can't get
any cuter than that I don't think I'm
going to take this on my favorite blush
brush and that is the it cosmetics blush
brush and I'm going to pop that on my
cheeks whoa
seems very pigmented oh it also smells
like a grandma that's actually really
nice this is definitely not a matte
blush it's definitely satin which I
don't mind I just don't really like
glitter in my blush but satin I can do
and I feel like this blush just makes
your cheeks look so cute and rosy
and I didn't apply it with the little
puffs that came with just because I
thought that that might make it just too
much everywhere blush and that's not
really the look I'm going for so I'm
just gonna tuck cats back into sleep
next I'll move on to highlighter because
I was very surprised that Paul and Joe
had a highlighter again it came in two
separate things so I got the compact
separately from the actual product so
this is what the highlighter compact
looks like again it has little cats on
it and it's just so cute it looks so
retro the inside looks like this I'm a
little bit nervous of this highlighter
to be honest because it looks very
shimmery and like I don't know so I'm
just going to take the morphe m3 1-0
brush and get a little bit of that on
there and let's hope this isn't horrible
I don't like it
I don't like it because it has a white
base you can see here it's just
completely white and then it has a
glitter overlay like you know how
sometimes products just have a really
shimmery top and then once you swatch it
the shimmers are all gone because it was
just a spray over and the next product
that I have is the waterproof eye brow
liner so this is what it looks like and
it actually comes without a top which I
was kind of surprised about but just has
a super super fine tip and this one is
in the shade 0-2 you kind of have to
push hard to get anything to come out
which isn't a horrible thing with brow
products but I usually just like to use
powder because I'm not even very good at
doing
eyebrows so these are the eyebrows all
filled in I would have to say if you
really really like super super precise
tipped eyebrow pencils you would like
this and it does say it's waterproof so
if that's true that would be really nice
because it would last a long time but
for me I'm not a super huge fan of
eyebrow pencils in general so I would
have to say no I'm probably not going to
use it a ton so I also got a liquid
eyeliner from Paul and Jo and it's the
liquid eyeliner in the shade zero one I
think that this is a brown one but I
love the packaging of this it has a
really nice light pink top with gold
accents and that's just favorite is
going on really smoothly it's a super
super fine tip and it's so so dark I
can't really tell that it's brown but I
think that it is because that's the
color of the cat okay so I finished that
liquid eyeliner and I feel like this is
a really good liquid eyeliner I'll have
to see how it lasts throughout the day
but for right now it's good and last but
not least I have two lipsticks here that
I wanted to show you guys and the
packaging that they have the lipsticks
are so cute
and I've seen pictures of Paul and Joe
cosmetics before and they had cat shaped
lipsticks but I couldn't find any online
so I was kind of sad about that but the
first lipstick case I got is Tom and
Jerry themed and it's so dang cute and
Tom and Jerry was my childhood so I had
to get this one and the lipstick I got
is kind of a coral shade again they come
separately so I already put it in its
tube I also got this lipstick case and
it has some like vintage e flowers on it
I love this case so much and the color
that's in it is more of like a mauve
color the first one I'll put on is the
coral one Oh
hmm so this lipstick feels really really
nice on your lips and see this sharp
edge that it has at the top it actually
works so well and going around your lips
I wish that all lipsticks had this tip
because it's so nice this lipstick isn't
super like pigmented it's not like all
full coverage right when you swipe it on
your lips but it is a really pretty just
glossy moisturizing coral lipstick so I
really like this one and the second one
I'll try is this Mabi one and this one
has the same moisturizing feeling as the
other one and it feels really nice again
it's not like a crazy lip color but I
feel like I would wear both of these on
a day to day basis just because they're
super easy and comfortable so I would
give the lipsticks a thumbs up I would
have to say first and foremost the
reason that I wanted to even try this
makeup is the packaging and the
packaging it gets a 10 out of 10 from me
I love it I think it's so cute I think
it's unique I never see any makeup
brands doing makeup quite as cute as
Paul and Joe cosmetics so I would
definitely say that it is something that
sets it apart and that I really really
enjoy about it um I would say that the
overall application of everything was
also really good I really liked the
makeup primer because I think it was
kind of different than what makeup
primers usually are just because it gave
me a little bit of extra coverage and
that's really nice I also really love
the powder I just love how it's huge and
it's kind of like a decoration for your
bin and I'd say my last thing that was
kind of like my favorite where the
lipstick just because I can see myself
wearing these all the time they're
really comfortable and cute yay
