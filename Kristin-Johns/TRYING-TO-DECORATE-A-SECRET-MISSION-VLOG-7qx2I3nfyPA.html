walked in she said it is nine o'clock in
the morning I needed to get up and get
ready kind of early because today is a
huge day for me Marcus I can't exactly
say what's happening but you guys will
find out very soon but I need you to get
up and get ready so my makeup is
completely done and I just wanted to
show you guys this new beautiful perfume
that I got this is the locks Etan tear
de Lumiere look at this bottle it's
beautiful so I just wanted to show you
guys that it smells so I don't I
wouldn't even know how to explain what
this smells like it smells like floral
subtle floral sweet beautiful deep and
this actually came in their collections
that they have for gift sets and I just
wanted to show you guys what comes in
these because I feel like these would
make such amazing gifts so it comes
wrapped like this how cute would this be
underneath the Christmas tree so pretty
and then it comes in a little gold box
like this and you could definitely save
this box and use it for something else
because it's very nice
so obviously you get the perfume which
is beautiful and lovely and special and
you also get the same scent of the
perfume but in a perfume to hand soap so
this would be so nice in your bathroom
or by your sink and then you also get
the beautifying body milk and this is of
course in the same scent it comes in a
bottle like this how beautiful is the
packaging on these and then you also get
a gentle shower gel in here so you can
kind of sample a bunch of things from
this line and especially if you know
that you love the smell of the perfume
so I wanted to share that with you guys
because this would make such an amazing
gift or if you just
try out some different things from walks
eat on then this would be a great gift
set to get yourself because you can
really try out a bunch of their
different products ok outfit of the day
time my jacket is from princess Polly my
shirt is this little California sure and
I got this from Goodwill for a dollar my
jeans are from obey and my shoes are
from vyas big Spiga feeis Vegas pika I
don't really know I'll link them down
below though these are from Nordstrom
and I actually just looked at the
weather and it says that it's 85 outside
so I'm gonna have to ditch the leather
jacket probably but right now in our
house it's just breathing because I
think that our house has a really bad
insulation so when it's cold at night
the whole house gets freezing we just
got done with oh it's such a secret guys
it's too much of a secret you can't let
them know yeah but now we're we're done
with their secrets
having a baby oh we're having some lunch
now at the cutest restaurant ever I'll
show you guys
look at this this is amazingly delicious
we just got home from lunch and I was
just laying on this little bench swing
that we have outside with the dogs
honey there's honey and I was watching
binging with babish I don't know if you
guys um have ever watched this YouTube
channel but I'm so addicted to it
basically this guy recreates a bunch of
dishes from like famous TV shows or
famous movies so right now he's
recreating Rachel's trifle from friends
and friends is like one of my favorite
shows ever saw is just laying out here
watching it this little swing is just so
nice we should get some cushions for it
or something because you kind of fall
through home little slips but it's
really nice especially when it's shady
like this honey what do you think she's
underneath the swing hey honey are you
eating my slipper she sprinted away
that's my bunny slipper they always take
my shoes out of my closet like bad
hounds no I know that you love this look
at this little face of just evil evil
bunny slipper eater girl sit sit honey
good girl guys it's true I have been
procrastinating and you want to see what
I've been procrastinating for this why
is it that my closet always just gets
completely and totally wrecked
I bought these dresses for the American
influence or Awards and now I have to
take them back but I'm sad because
they're so pretty
but I shouldn't just keep dresses just
to keep them because I don't have
anywhere to wear them but this was one
of the options for the dresses that I
was gonna wear and then I also had this
which is like a black halter jumpsuit
thing and I was gonna maybe wear that
and then I also got this dress which has
it's kind of like a wrap dress and I was
gonna wear that maybe two I had to get
options because I bought all these
options the day of and I was like I
don't know what to wear so I have to
return all of these this is exactly why
it's important to clean out your closet
because then you find the most exciting
things look what I found I found these
two little stockings that I bought at
Target like a week ago
it was only a week ago but still I kind
of forgot about them I got them from the
Magnolia collection and now I just need
to find a place to put them up so let's
go find one okay the thing is we already
have this wreath hanging over our TV but
maybe we could put like the stockings on
either side wait let me fail down I need
y'all's help okay cuz I know a lot of
you guys have dogs camper is the
weirdest dog because he always has to
bring us something when we get home or
really if it's been like 10 minutes
since I've hung out with them he like
must bring me something and it's usually
something that is not a toy so he like
brings me for example like something
like this or he should help try to bring
me a plant or a pillow or something that
I don't want him to chew do any of you
guys have this problem
if you have golden retrievers because it
gotten to a point where anytime someone
comes over he'll take the whatever
they're holding and like try to give it
back to them but they just think he's
trying to like ruin their things so it's
getting to a point where I it's so cute
I don't want him to stop because I know
he's trying to be nice and bring us
something but it's bad it's a bad habit
but I don't know guys this is Shelby by
the way I feel like I've just been
showing your face and it's like ish me
this is Marcus's little sister the one
who introduced us I didn't oh my gosh
that was me
but guys tell him what happened
Kristin has very nice candles in her
house but she is there she always likes
them obviously and I went to look in the
mirror today to I don't know to inspect
myself and I leaned over and my hair
fell into the candle and I looked down
and there was a flame in my hair it like
my life flashed before my eyes and I was
just like she'll be like there was like
a little candle at the bottom of you
know it was big it was a big orange and
blue flame in this like pushing on my
hand and what is it all here hair caught
him I'm telling you I was screaming and
you and Marcus we're oblivious here it's
just Cimmerian like baby and I was like
I don't know I just was like it went out
that could have been horrible and I had
to tell you guys cuz funniest most
horrible oh and our house smelled like
burning well I think it probably does
don't we're leaving Cody and Lexi's
house
and we are in the Geo Tracker with the
doors completely off like this
no door
it's kind of scary
my likeness
it's the best way to heaven show the
whole actual door is now
like
like I am just like able to fall out of
this car right now but don't worry I'm
buckled up
we just got home and I'm about to go to
sleep Marcus is in the shower I'm gonna
have to go wash my face and take all my
makeup off but I wanted to end you guys
with a tiny little devotion and I was
just reading a random devotional in line
that I actually found on Pinterest but I
just wanted to read a little section of
it to you and I thought it was really
good because I haven't really thought
about this type of thing for a while so
this is what it says Holy Spirit show me
the changes I need to make in order to
possess my promised land thank you for
preparing me to be a blessing to others
and fulfill the destiny that you have
for me and then the devotion talks about
how a lot of times we desire to be in
the exact place that God wants us to be
but sometimes we are too stubborn to
actually make the changes or make the
steps that we need to make in order to
reach the place that God actually wants
us to be and that just really reminded
me that this isn't really a one-way
street at all when it comes to God's
plan for us like we have to make choices
and decisions in order to fulfill his
actual plan for us like we really have
to listen to God and make changes in our
lives maybe that are holding us back or
remove people in our lives that are
being a negative influence to us or stop
doing certain things that are harming us
make stricter boundaries in our lives
when it comes to relationships like it
could be a ton of different things that
God wants us to change and that can be
really scary at times I think for me
right now the biggest change that God is
wanting me to make in my life is just to
be more present in each and every moment
because it can just be so hard like with
your phone always in your hand and just
there's a million different distractions
that are just that are just always
tempting me to not be totally present
and not totally there in each moment and
I feel like God really uses us in the
moments that we wouldn't expect it and
in the moments that we're super present
and being very intentional in our
relationships or when we're not even
expecting it and just being present and
maybe he has to put someone in your life
that you didn't even expect to be there
I don't know I feel like that's the
biggest thing that God has been kind of
teaching me lately and I don't know if
you guys have something in your life
where you're like I know I need to
change this but it's really hard to give
XY and Z up but I would just really
encourage you guys to just pray about it
or just think about it and I don't know
it's always it's always when you get out
of your comfort zone or like make a
change that like the most amazing things
happen so that's my little encouragement
for you guys tonight and I love you guys
so much I'm sad Marcus wasn't in this
vlog very much but what's he in this
vlog at all I can't really remember and

great rest of your night or day and I'll
