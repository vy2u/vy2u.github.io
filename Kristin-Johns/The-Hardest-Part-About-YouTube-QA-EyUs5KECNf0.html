little bit more of a casual video just
sitting down and talking to you so I
decided a QA would be perfect for that
so I went on Twitter and I asked you
guys to leave me any questions that you
would like to leave me using the hashtag
asked crispy and economy-wise left me
questions and I'm really excited to
answer them and talk to you guys so
let's just get started ok so the first
question is um if you could have any six
animals as pets what would they be and
I'm going to take this as I could have
any animal in the world not just like
domesticated animals so that is pretty
easy for me because I love animals so I
can just choose six very quickly so I
would choose a deer a lamb a dog golden
retriever to be exact
a cat which already have a cat biscuit I
choose you and uh did I already say lamb
oh no I forgot what I said a cow and a
fox that would be all of my six pets and
I would be in heaven if I could have all
those animals somebody asked how I
overcame anxiety because I mentioned in
another video I think is like the 50
facts about me video that I used to have
anxiety but I don't anymore therapy kind
of helped but it didn't like get rid of
it but one night I was praying and I was
like Jesus please just take this away
from me because I'm about to leave for
college and I just don't know how the
heck I'm gonna get through college with
such bad anxiety and from then on out
after I kind of just like gave that
strong hold in my life up and just like
trusted it to Jesus I've really the next
few weeks it really just went away and
I've never had anxiety since so praise
Jesus and yeah that's how I overcame
anxiety a ton of people always ask what
this ring is
and I've worn this ring since I was 18
so it's been in every video like every
picture I posted so a lot of you are
curious to know what my ring is and it's
from my dad he got it for me for my 18th
birthday and it is by David Yurman I
think so yeah it's not an engagement
ring a lot of you always think it's an
engagement ring but no it's just from my
dad I think of my dad every single time
I look at it and I just think wow my dad
is so special to me if you could change
one thing about yourself what would it
be I would change the fact that I care
so much about what people think about me
and what people will think about my
decisions and just stuff like that I
don't know I just wish that I didn't
care as much I was just really scared to
start a YouTube channel because I was
scared about what people would think
about it but I'm really glad that I did
start a YouTube channel because 100% it
has taken me out of my comfort zone and
I think it's made me more comfortable
with who I am you guys are nervous about
starting a YouTube channel or not even
that but just like nervous about trying
out for a sport or nervous about
anything really just because of what
people might think of you if it doesn't
go well then I would HIGHLY encourage
you to just go ahead and do it because I
would be so sad if I never started
youtube because of what people thought
about me and it's like brought so many
cool opportunities to my life and I
think that that just goes to show that
you shouldn't make decisions out of fear
of what people will think about you
somebody asked if you could have a
magical power what would you do and I
think I'm tied between two I would
either choose teleportation so that I
could just like close my eyes and then
think of a place I wanted to go and then
I'll just be there and that's free
travel and that's amazing and it's quick
travel and that's amazing and I could
just be with Marcus whenever I wanted I
could use my sister whenever I wanted to
take it one I've always wanted this
superpower ever since I was little and
it would be to be able to talk to
animals and you could know what they
were thinking and you could be real
friends with them
and yeah so I would choose those two
somebody asked when you're feeling down
what things do you do to help cheer
yourself up um what do I do
I usually like to be either by myself or
just like with one person that I'm
really close to um but when I'm feeling
down I'm the type of person I need to
like talk things out with somebody
because if I just hold it in I'll just
hold it in hold it in a ton of stuff
will make me upset and then I will just
like have a big cry and it will just be
really bad somebody asked who gave me
the nickname of Krispy and I think my
sister was the first person to call me
Christy but then when I came to college
and I lived with my roommates that I
have now um they all call me Christy all
time and it's kind of an ongoing joke
because I love Krispy Kreme Doughnuts
so it's perfect crispy Krispy Kreme
Doughnuts goes hand in hand
last question somebody asked how do
people respond to your openness about
your faith on your channel and that is a
really good question
and I think I would have to say overall
very positively which makes me so happy
I knew when I was starting out on
YouTube that I was going to talk about
my faith because it's something that
makes me who I am it's something I love
and I'm passionate about so um I was a
little bit nervous to talk about it I
was like I don't know if people are
gonna be like really mad at me for
talking about my face but really it's
been a positive thing and even people
that watch my channel that don't love
Jews necessarily I think everybody has
been really nice and people know that
everybody has like different opinions
about things and different beliefs okay
guys that is it for today's video I
really hope that you guys liked it and
if you do like these type of videos just
more like talking up videos then I give
this video a thumbs up and also don't
forget to subscribe for a new video
every Monday and I love you guys so much
I hope you're having a great day and I
will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
