Kristen drove the Jeep you said it you
think Jesus meant to exclude
way easier
so random
all ladies and gentlemen you heard it
there first the Jeep's on the fritz see
if we can get it home we're almost
almost halfway there so we gotta get
there first and make it all the way home
we are finally in Kalispell Montana
Kalispell Montana we're driving to
Glacier National Park now Marcus is in
awe of the city that's when you know
you're dating Kristen is when you say
well they have nothing here but yeah
we're going to go be biking today Marcus
actually got me an electric bike which
is the most fun thing I've ever done in
my whole life so we're going to do that
all of it mountains don't worry mama but
where I have that Wow look at this table
guys it's like piglets got the bike
dance looking so freakin cute I can't
believe it
we'll see how it doesn't a mountain
trail I'll get my shoes
they're from the hiking store so we're
his sometimes Marcus is like my dad
don't clip my face oh she's part her
cheeks are so squishy they could get
caught in the clip babe
quit pushing my hand I can't freakin
clip it this is tight all right
I'm rockin this guy hey ready I think
it's pretty self-explanatory let's do it
you lead the way
yeah just one easy trip now we're going
home good job Kristin Marcus keeps
saying how he wants to live in Montana
so we have this bright idea to have
Kristen be pulled behind the Jeep and
sled on my jacket because it's the only
thing that we have right now that'll be
sort of slippery
all right good for it
okay ready
Christon
let's say that looks pretty successful
except that I got snow in my baby

vanilla dream by my side and we about to
be biked through waste your National
Park I'll show you all the prettiness in
a minute makes me wanna cry every why

gonna skip this rock

rocks together come on man every time
