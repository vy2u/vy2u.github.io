you how to make some homemade Christmas
presents for your friends and family and
I think that homemade Christmas presents
are really special I think they're
really thoughtful and they show that you
put a lot of effort into someone's
Christmas gift so I'm going to be
showing guys how to make three different
presents and I know that crafts can
sometimes feel a little bit of whelming
or like they'll take a long time but I
feel like these are really fast and
they're simple to do so I hope that you
guys enjoy them and also I know the
holiday seasons can get kind of
expensive buying a lot of people
different gifts and there's a really
cool website called carne pool comm you
can actually buy and sell use two gift
cards they have tons and tons of
different stores to choose from so if
you wanted to buy any of these crafts
you could go onto carpool and see if
there is a craft store near you
available in the discount cards and you
can potentially save up to 35% on a gift
card so I just thought I would share
that with you guys because I think that
is a great way you save money this
Christmas season so I think that's all I
have to share with you guys for the
event started so I hope that you like
using three thoughtful Christmas gifts
so the first thing that you're going to
need is one mason jar some little brown
present tags any type of twine that you
want some little baby marshmallows
cookies and I made chocolate chip
cookies and put green and red M&amp;amp;Ms in
them to make them a little bit more
festive and also about one cup of dry
hot chocolate mix okay so first things
first you take your mason jar and we're
going to start by putting the hot
chocolate mix into the bottom of the jar
I think I'm going to use about one cup
of hot chocolate mix and then you just
and then it might be a little bit messy
but I have one tip maybe use a funnel to
put in your hot chocolate because mine
actually got everywhere and then we're
gonna do a layer of mini marshmallows so
just put those in there and that will be
the layer that will separate the hot
chocolate from getting all the cookies
so just put some of those in there and
then you should have something that
looks like this I think that it looks so
cute so then you're just going to take
your cookies and you can really make any
cookies for this so then all you have to
do is pop those in there
now that we have our jars filled you're
just going to take your twine and wrap
it right around the top of the jar and
then once you have it wrapped around the
jar just put on your little tag I wrote
Merry Christmas online and then you can
just go ahead and tie it into a nice bed
and I think that it looks really really
cute and I just think that it is a
perfect stocking stuffer for any of your
friends or family especially those that
have a little bit of a sweet tooth and
for the second gift that we're making
all you're going to need is slice of
wood and you can get this at craft
stores and also you're going to need one
wood burner I think that wood burning is
a really thoughtful gift idea because
it's really unique also this is a gift
that people can use as decoration and I
just think it's a really special thing
to have in your house ok so my biggest
tip for wood burning would probably be
to practice on a scrap piece of wood
before you go in to your actual art
workpiece
and then after you have your first layer
of burning down then you can actually go
over and trace back any bald spots like
I have some here and here but just take
your time with it I think you might want
to know about wood burning is that the
longer you hold the burner on the wood
the darker that it's going to be and the
thicker the line is going to be and if
you drag the pin in a more fast rate
then you'll have a more sin and less
opaque one this is how I'm going to
leave mine I like that it's just simple
so that is the second gift so the third
gift idea is a homemade card and I'm
going to be using watercolors today but
if you don't have water colors you can
use any type of paint or you can use
markers or pens and pencils it's really
whatever you're comfortable with and
whatever you want to do but I think that
making someone a homemade card is really
special and I think it can be really
sweet to receive a homemade card so I
will show you guys just how I do it for
this Christmas card I am actually doing
it for my dad and his name is Brian so I
wrote out a B and you can do this for
anybody's name you could do any letter
and I just put some decorations around
it with pencil and then I'm just gonna
go over it with some watercolors and
watercolor it in
this is the finished Christmas card
obviously you can write whatever you
want in here and I think that this
turned out really cute okay guys that is
