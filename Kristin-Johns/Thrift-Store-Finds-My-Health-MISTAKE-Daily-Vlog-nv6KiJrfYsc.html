vouchers for neutering your pets and
they're only like $30 so it's perfect
for college students that are on a
budget it's a thrift store and I love
their stores so I got a few things and
I'll show you guys I got a few cards I
always feel like strip stores have the
best cards and I can set you guys right
here so I got this one and it says

25 cents so just and I got I'm such a
grandma I got this cat magnet for our
fridge but it's kind of like FSU colors

ears I love him and I also found this
and this is only two dollars and it's
like a ceramic weight feels like pottery
like whatever that texture is and it's a
little buffalo head and I think it's so
cute I think I'll probably paint it
white so that it goes by rim war but I
love it and that was only two dollars so
