partnering with fab spawn to show you
what is in their summer box if you guys
don't know what happen is it is a
seasonal subscription box that comes
four times a year and each of the boxes
is $50 but you get over $200 worth of
products in each box oh and before I get
started I just want to say thank you
guys for all of the love on me and
Marcus's wedding video we posted it on
our channel I'll link the video down
below if you haven't seen it but I know
a ton of you guys have been asking for a
really long time for that video okay so
the first thing in here which is like a
little bonus is this vital proteins
marine sorry campers outside and he
might be barking a little bit of Trance
this video but it's the viral proteins
at marine collagen dietary supplement
and it's just supposed to be good for
your hair and your nails and all things
like that and this is like a powder it
feels like and I think that you just mix
this in with maybe like your protein
shake or some water oh I see something
that I'm very excited about okay I'm
just going to do the most exciting
things first because I have been needing
a water bottle so bad if you guys saw my
fitness routine I'm pretty sure I was
saying how bad I need a water bottle so
I got a water bowl and I'm very happy
about that so this is the bkr I think
that's how you say the name of this
company water bottle it's 500
milliliters and it retails for $35 and
it's very cute and it feels very like
grippy I like that I like the texture I
like the design they're cute and then
the next thing I see in here is copper
and I love copper so I'm very excited
about this this is the on the road again
travel set in this retail for $25 but
what is it
I don't know let's open it up okay so
this is a passport holder and it says on
the road again other little thing it
comes with is a little luggage tag and
it says hands off which is very cute
because you don't want anyone taking
your luggage so I love this this is a
very cute idea I don't know if I said
this but it retails for $28 and that is
such a great thing to have in the summer
box because people are showering the
next thing in here is sunscreen it is
broad-spectrum 50 plus and it's
water-resistant and it's fast absorbing
and a matte finish and something
interesting about this is it says a tip
is to mix this with your favorite
foundation to get extra coverage but I
don't know how this would give you extra
coverage unless it's colored oh it's
just white so I don't know how this
would give you extra coverage for your
foundation but that's an interesting
concept we also have this and this says
Michael stars rawana
scarf sarong I don't really know what
this is I guess it's like a little scarf
this retails for $54 and I think the
idea behind this is that you can wear it
in a lot of different ways I'll have to
figure that out because I don't know how
else to wear this except for a scarf
maybe like you can do it like on your
head or something
I don't know I'll have to figure that
out later but this is the oh three susan
cool peppermint plus one
dog barking dog barking the Soudan cool
peppermint and German chamomile
post-training
massage oil and it has 100% Naturals
plus vitamin E the first thing I think
when I see this massage oil is that
Marcus will be very happy to have this
because he's he's addicted to back rub
back scratches any type of rub he's
obsessed with I got massage or
oh and this retails for $30 29:56 $30
the next step we got something from
Juice Beauty which I always want to say
juice duty but excuse Beauty you can see
I automatically want to say that I guess
this is just an under-eye cream which is
great I don't have one of these and I
need one so this is very cute look at
this tiny little bottle okay we're down
to the last two products this one comes
in bubble wrap so I'm thinking it must
be delicate Wow look how cute the whole
ball is oh my gosh
tiny bird just landed outside this is a
little necklace and this is by Chris
nations and Assam mystic bar necklace
miss retails for $58 and this is so cute
it's just so simple sweet oh this one is
actually moonstone and this says it
provides strength inner peace and growth
campuses
oh no I'm going up and the last thing in
here is this which I'm very excited
about this is the cargo HD
picture-perfect highlighter in bronze
and wow I didn't think it was a
highlighter I thought it was a bronzer
so even better I love highlighter in the
picture it looks so dark that's why I
thought it was just a regular bronzer
but let's see I think that that will be
a highlighter what do you think this is
so soft
let's watch it it's very subtle but it's
very pretty
well this highlighter retails for $30
which brings the total value of box to
two hundred and seventy two dollars to
two hundred eighty-seven dollars
depending which selection that you go
out so there's always a little bit of
variety in each talk I think the thing
that I'm most excited about is this
water bottle and because I it's like
fast fun knew that I needed this and
they provided it and it
very happy and my second favorite thing
in this box was the little travel duels
a little copper passport holder and a
little luggage tag I think that these
are so cute so these are my two favorite
things that came in the box I also have
a $10 off coupon code for your first box
which is really happy so you just have
to use the code Kristen and you can get
that discount but I really hope you guys
like this video if he did please give it
a thumbs up and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I love you
guys so much I hope you're having a
great start to your summer it's so hot
here in LA it's reaching like the
hundreds which is way too hot but I'm
cool and like the 80s so it needs to go
down like 20 degrees and then I'll be
good but I love you guys and I will see
you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
