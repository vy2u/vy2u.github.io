haven't done a QA in so stinkin long
I think it's been six months since I've
just sat down and done a Q&amp;amp;A just me and
you
but for this Q&amp;amp;A I wanted to make it a
little bit different because I want to
answer questions that I've never
answered before and questions that are a
little bit more not risky because risque
is like that but more like raw and deep
questions also before I start I slept
with my hair in braids last night and so
my hair is like totally crimped okay
let's start with a big one right of that
someone said how difficult was it for
you and Marcus to save yourself for each
other do you have any advice for couples
aiming for that - and Marcus has talked
about this on his channel before how we
waited for marriage top SEC and I've
never discussed it on my channel before
but I'm definitely open to talking about
it with you guys because I know for some
reason sex is an awkward topic for
Christians to talk about which I don't
really know why I think it needs to be a
topic that's discussed more openly so
then it's not like this weird stigma
surrounding it but with the help of
Jesus and with the help of boundaries
and with the help of both of us having
the same moral beliefs which is very
very important for something like this
because I feel like if one person didn't
believe that and the other person did it
would just be way harder but both of us
were on the same page both of us wanted
to wait until marriage and it definitely
was not easy but we did it and I'm so
happy that we did and I know probably
for a lot of guys watching this it's
probably really weird for me to be
saying that I didn't have sex until
marriage but it is what we believe we're
Christians and that is just our moral
belief just know that it's so worth the
wait like it's so worth it just like
being there together on your wedding
night experiencing something like that
is just very special and I also want to
say I completely understand this
is not even a possibility for some
people some people get their virginity
taken away from them through sexual
abuse and rape which is absolutely
horrible so I don't want to make anyone
feel like oh if you have sex for
marriage that stinks for you but I just
I'm just saying from my personal
experience I'm super glad that we had
the ability to wait I hope that I
answered that question well the next
question someone asked do you have any
advice for someone who's an introvert
quiet and has a hard time making friends
I would say to you that I am probably in
the same boat as you because I would
definitely classify myself as someone I
don't know I would consider myself an
introvert but I'm definitely someone who
is more shy and quiet less so now
because I don't know I think Marcus has
brought me out of my comfort zone a lot
and has kind of helped me become more
confident but I'm still definitely more
shy and not like this extroverted person
like super loud about going all the time
but my advice for you would just be to
know that it is okay to be shy it's okay
to be quiet not everyone has to be like
the loudest person in the room you know
what I'm saying
I feel like shy people kind of get just
like swept under the rug sometimes like
people don't really appreciate shy
people and I think that's really sad
because my dad always told me that he
said still waters run deep and that's so
true people that sometimes aren't saying
every single thing they think sometimes
their thoughts and their opinions are
the most like special and deep ones that
you kind of have to work harder for to
get to know so I really appreciate shy
people so my advice to someone who is
more shy and maybe you're going into
high school or going into college or a
new job and you're finding it hard to
make you friends just go up to one
person that you think seems cool and
that you'd be friends with and just
start up a conversation maybe ask them
to go out to get coffee with you and I
just think it's maybe easier to go up to
someone individually than like a whole
huge group of people okay
someone said have you ever
dreaded becoming a you cube and I think
that she would say is becoming a
youtuber and no I've never regretted
becoming a youtuber it's actually very
weird for me to say that I'm a youtuber
because I never thought that I would be
but I just feel honestly overall very
blessed that this is my job being able
to sit down and talk to you guys about
life talking to you guys about things
that I love like makeup and fashion and
my family and sharing my life of you
guys there's seriously like I can't
think of another job that I would like
more than this so I really really try
and not to take it for granted and so I
would I would then never have regretted
it obviously there's been times where I
get annoyed by it or I get discouraged
but I never regret doing YouTube because
overall I just feel very lucky to be a
youtuber so yeah I've never regretted it
oh I love this question someone said how
has Marcus changed you as a person and
it makes me kind of like what I cry
because Marcus has changed me oh my gosh
guys if you knew me before before start
dating Marcus I was the most shy person
in the whole world
which like I was saying earlier is not a
bad thing but I was very insecure I was
very like here's an example I wouldn't
even want to talk to the waiter at a
restaurant like I would want Marcus to
order for me or if like I didn't like my
food I would want Marcus to say
something or just like not say something
at all so we were talking about this at
dinner last night I was just saying like
I have changed so much since I met you
we even look back at videos of when me
and Marcus first started dating like
even our first ever YouTube video
together on this channel I acted so
differently because I was just so shy
like even if we were just hanging out by
ourselves and he was like do a video of
me and him I would like run away and
hide because I didn't want to be on the
camera and now I do this for my living
like it's just kind of all come full
circle so I would say being both
confident brave speaking my mind
Marcus has brought all of those things
out of me okay next question that
someone asked has there been a really
hard time in your life that God put to
teach you something can you share it ah
yes I think that the hardest time in my
life was sophomore year of high school
two senior year of high school I think
I've talked about this on my channel
before but I had horrible insomnia - I
didn't sleep well for three years like
those whole three years I couldn't sleep
at night I was laying in bed I'll get in
bed at 8 o'clock at night and I was
laying in bed until 7:00 in the morning
I went to have me up for school and I
would not sleep at all until like three
days went by and then I just fell asleep
from exhaustion and I couldn't sleep
because I had so much anxiety and my
brain would not shut off and it it was
because of so many different things like
I had four people in my family pass away
in like a two year period and we had so
much going on in our family my sister
had moved to Copenhagen which was like
horrible to me because she's my best
friend and I just think back at that
time and it makes me so sad because I
was in such a bad place I remember one
night I was sitting on my bed and I was
crying it because I couldn't go to sleep
in um I just finally said Jesus please
take this away from me like I should not
do this anymore
I really want to go to sleep I'm about
to go to college and I can't go to
college like this like I will not
survive and from that point on it just
progressively got better better he
taught me the power of him and the power
of prayer and the power of faith and to
lean on him in every situation
100% it's what it taught me it changed
my life it went from the worst time in
my life to like the most wow moment in
my life
you know what I'm saying okay someone
said tell us the story about your first
kiss and I've never told the story on
the internet before so here we go
it's not really a funny first kiss story
like I know some people have like
amazing first kiss stories but basically
he was
over at my house I don't think that we
were dating yet we did go on to date
later but I don't think we were dating
and we were just sitting upstairs and
then he leaned over and kissed me and it
really wasn't bad or awkward or anything
is just like normal so I don't really
have a horrible first kiss story now I'm
going to move on to questions from
snapchat I want to know divergent okay
two questions so are we having babies
yes one day we are having babies but not
anytime soon so I know sometimes when I
say I have a big announcement or
something everyone gets really excited
and thinks that I'm pregnant but that is
not going to happen for a really long
time guys like seven years it's not
going to be for a while but we
definitely do want to have babies in the
future and she also asked divergent our
hunger games I've never seen divergent
so hungry OKC asked me what type of
libel I have I have a quest Study Bible
maybe I should go get it have this Bible
for so long I actually get this question
a lot so I'm glad that you asked I have
the quest Study Bible like I said it's
this blue one and I love it I've had it
for so long
I don't really know what having another
Bible is like but it just really awesome
and it has some like excerpts that kind
of explains certain things to you so if
something's confusing most luckily it
has like a little thing about it and I
love it oh I love you oh my god so many
people okay
how has YouTube affected my journey with
Christ um I think it's only affected it
positively to be honest just seeing
messages for me you guys saying that
I've impacted your relationship with
Christ is insane and I just feel like
that can only be possible with Jesus
because
it's definitely not me changing people
it's definitely Jesus's love through me
I wanted to know what kind of music you
like to listen to together thinking
never met before and what kind of music
do I listen to I listen to country music
I love country music a Josh Turner my
number one fave I also love Sam hunt I
also love Carrie Underwood how can I
forget Carrie Underwood like my girl so
I love country music
and I also like listening to like chill
music I don't know how else to describe
out now what genre it is what kind of
like John Mayer Ben rector Sam Smith I
don't know what's the strangest habit
you have whoo I like that question in
the video um
the strangest habit that I have oh we
need Marcus in here for this because he
probably knows I think a strange habit
that I have is that I really like going
on the Instagram Explorer page and
looking through the roof it called the
oddly satisfying little video section
where they're like cutting clay if
they're like cutting sand or like
spreading paint I have the habit of
sitting there for like 30 minutes and
watching that and then I'm just like I
just really wasted 30 minutes of my life
but I love watching those videos and you
guys have to know what I'm talking about
okay guys that is it for today's Q&amp;amp;A I
really hope that you enjoyed it if you
do like q and A's and you want me to
sprinkle them in a little bit more give
this video a thumbs up don't forget to
subscribe to my channel I love you guys
so much and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
