here in Italy and there's just a box of
them just crawling around at this hotel
they don't even care that we pet them or
anything which is crazy

lovebirds lovebirds
speaking of lovebirds thank you

embarrassed to show you guys should I
hold one of these turtles really fix
whoa dude that was very old but time

tiny old man the tiny baby turtle
Wow the last view
the most beautiful place on earth
there's Cody and Lexy we're about to
drive we're going straight to Venice
it's about a five-hour drive so we gotta
hit the road Kristen tomatoes pull over
on the side of the road for the
sunflower field I've never seen a
sunflower
I love it
let's walk in it a bit look at the
honeybees Chris
for somewhere in Italy and we're just in
the middle of this sunflower farm
some flowers taller than me seven foot
tall sunflowers Wow how cool
and these things are thick they're like
trees they really are like little trees
wait what do they use them for sunflower
seeds yes I'm gonna know I think
sunflower seeds
look how big and beautiful that is
it's big what's up Vicky is here

earth down on the ground yep sure did
this bee pollinating right now making
begging himself in there huh well he
went he left I'm happy nothing can bring
me down I clean up in my sunflower bugs
here's the cup sunflower buns et Oh
there was it worth it sunflower bug yes
it was so here we are in Venice for
check this and forget
what
when this guy seems to shine like Yuva
had too much wine that's
we did some research and they actually
put into the forest of Shree trunks
under the city to keep the buildings
from sinking into the mud we're so smart
and so special how did you know all that
stuff
I'm just very smart what do you think
about it I think how do these guys
control the boat just one or on one side
it's very interesting
it's in
it can be any more classic huh
bye-bye Venice
see you later bets
finally got just like chillin across the
border into Switzerland and the border
was actually pretty chilly and have to
present any passports no nothing like
that and it's still looking kind of
Italian things are still written in
Italian but I think that we're going to
kind of groove into like a German dish
way of lifestyle in the German style and
we went to a German store and got this
half German half Italian wait what did I
say you said Jeremy would have Swiss
half Italian Swiss
can happen dinner barley Bieber patents
in their barley b-but we face it
I get the big sigh because you've got
the small set like I mean just give me
the bedside
that's great for the big show you like
the happens la Barba new year study be
bad oh honey
what
finally Bieber it's like cinnamon Martin
happy but I receive and
or title
right here we come
we're about two hours of labor chips
though
basically what happened is we were about
to go through a 10-mile tunnel like one
of the longest tunnels in Switzerland
and right before we got to the tunnel it
got shut off there's some fire or some
type of crazy accident that happened
there was a ton of fire trucks so I
ended up talking to some people and they
said well you can't in the pass but you
know if the tunnel opens up it's here
it's like an hour to get around the pass
so you know what we decided to take the
scenic view and the path look at this
look at it beautiful
oh the camera does my capture if it was
daytime it would just be get out of this
world so basically we are already in
Switzerland I just can't believe that
people live here they're so lucky we had
to take a pee break Wow
we've been driving forever how was your
pee I can't see anything right now and I
feel like I'm at Mario Kart on Rainbow
Road right now I'm just like what is
going on I really can't see anything in
space you get one car in front of us
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
