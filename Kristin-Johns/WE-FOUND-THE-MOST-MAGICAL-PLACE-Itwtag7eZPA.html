ready for the day except for I haven't
put on my lipstick which is what this
video is all about because Sephora
collection has just recently launched
ninety shades of their lip stains which
are super long-lasting and the fact that
they come in ninety shades now is just
insane so I'm going to show you the box
that I have of all the shades it comes
in a pizza box because these are super
long wearing so they're Pizza proof
they're pretty much just life proof and
that's kind of what I want to show you
guys today so look at all these colors
so I'm gonna show you guys some of my
favorite shades and then I'm gonna take
you guys with me throughout the rest of
my day because me and Marcus have a
really fun day planned so I'll show you
guys just how long-lasting and like life
proof these lipsticks are okay so the
first one that I'm going to show you
guys is this one called frosted rose and
it's number 61 and I love their metallic
formula because I feel like some
metallic formulas are like more drying
and I think it kind of like flaky but
these just go on so nice look at that so
this is what number 61 looks like this
is definitely one that I would just
reach for every day or even if I just
want like a little bit of extra
something I think that this one is
perfect another shade that I want to try
out for you guys is the number 72 it's
called alter ego and this is just like
my perfect nude like if I could create
my perfect nude it would be exactly this
so I'm gonna show you guys what it looks
like look at that
it's hard for me to not wear this color
every single day because it's so perfect
and this is the one that I'm going to be
wearing today this is called chili
pepper number 78 and I just love these
like bright orange-red colors for the
summer so pretty so this is the color
that I'm going to be wearing today I
love it so much this one also make
teeth look really white now I'm ready to
take all the day I mean you can really
take on the day when you have a bold
like hot red lipstick I feel like and
now I'm excited to go on all of the
adventures that meat markets have
planned today and take you guys along
with me
I want sunlight on a brighter day
