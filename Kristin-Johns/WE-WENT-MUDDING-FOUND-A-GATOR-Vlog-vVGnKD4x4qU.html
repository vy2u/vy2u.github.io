on these pants she's burnt her leg on so
many exhaust pipes that's just like
she'll figure it out somehow to burn her
leg another exhaust pipe so she doesn't
go anywhere without these pants on
anymore they look really good I wish I
was wearing those but I'm having to wear
these guys to my childhood round look at
this Chris Andrew that I just had like a

and all look at that sparkling helmet
here's the thing this is a genuine 1984
ATC 200s this is our seat right here
it's a throw cushion so comfortable all
right go for it just keep your feet on
the inside yeah there you go
all right we're doing our first river
crossing
so we just got done with our first three
wheeling adventure I don't know if I
love it
it's really shaky so my hand turned all
red because I'm holding on the bars and
I got bit by a bug on my hand but I
forgot to mention that um this was
Marcus's Christmas present to himself
little three-wheeler
but we're matching we're not our pants
look at five legs right now
try to run it all over like try to like
run over like the big parts of the sand
like way up high yeah keep doing it
the alligator carcass just with the left
hand know someone killed that is crazy
all the buzzards came and ate it this is
probably most Florida picture I've ever
seen you can shift gears and everything
now what do you want to name it little
red I had a truck named little red I'd
like to have another little red cuz we
got the big red in the little red what
if we named it flying crystal because
it's like stick shift then it's red like
cinnamon okay so that's cinema stay
and it just kind of lift your feet up
when you go through it now gas and hard
oh go go go go that's it keep going good
job Chris who did it just you did it you
did so good

the easy side that the hard side yeah
right this way left hard left
so look Chris when you feel when you
feel the engine oh man when you feel it
start grabbing like you see house like
not going anywhere when it starts to
grab start to let off the gas because
you don't want to keep gassing it and we
Li you know you want to just like let it
grab you did good you see how you let
off that time the first time you kept
gassing you kind of we leave a little
bit oh my word
feels good to get disgustingly muddy we
just stop back in the final order of
business to get for a walk now grab a
dub dub scrub dub dub you taught me how
to ride a three-wheeler how do you think
I did Tennyson what do you think your
shoes ever gonna be white again ah he
risked me
I'm glad that's not me I'm sitting here
in the parking lot of Home Depot because
Marcus had to go inside and get some
type of gadget but I forgot to mention
that I'm using my new camera to vlog
today which I'm so excited about so
hopefully you can see the quality is a
little bit better I just said quality
also I forgot to tell you guys Merry
Christmas I hope you guys had a really
happy holiday
hopefully spent it with some friends or
family we actually spent it at Marcus's
house in West Palm with his family so it
was really fun also something else that
I don't think that I've showed you guys
are these shoes I have never showed them
on YouTube I don't think I didn't get
them for Christmas but I was just
looking at them and these are definitely
10 out of 10 my favorite shoes that I've
ever had
they are adidas and I got them on ASOS
but the reason that I love them so much
guys is because they are like pillows on
your feet I love wearing these I've wear
them with everything I'm just wearing
them with this little dress I have on
today but wow they're so comfy all right
Kristin one wanted some type of update
for this vlog because I needed to end it
but I forgot to finish filming this is
this is my messy room so um so we went
to Publix and we got something that
we've never had for well I didn't know
if I have that but we decided to finish
the vlog with a bang so together me and
Marcus are gonna try Turkish Delight so
my camera just died um but we're gonna
be trying Turkish delicious light
Turkish Delight we're really thinking
milk fat color no fat perfect that's
what I love this is definitely not I
think that this is a delicacy in Turkey
you think so mm-hmm
I didn't think it had chocolate on my
Turkish let's do it
Turkish I love baklava that
specialty all right Cheers fathers oh no
we have to show them the close up this
is what the Turkish Delight looks like
it's a nice coating of chocolate
it's very smells like chocolate
okay it has a nice little shine to it
and let's see what the inside looks like
oh it has a different texture than I
 it okay
you can't tear it up and it's to jelly
okay same time three two one Cheers
Oh cute mm-hmm delightful mmm tastes
like perfume huh this is what the inside
looks like
hmm it's not as delightful as it helped
okay guys um Turkish Delight from Publix
maybe it's not the best but probably the
original Turkish Delight that they
actually make is probably very good so I
think we'll call this Turkish not
