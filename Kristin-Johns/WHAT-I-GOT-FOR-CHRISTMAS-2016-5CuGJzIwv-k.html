film my neighbor starts mowing his lawn
oh no he's pressure washing perfect
she's still going it's been like 30
minutes if you still are washing this
thing oh hey guys today I am going to
show you what I got for Christmas this
year I hope you all had such a happy
Christmas I had a really happy Christmas
um yeah I'm feeling very annoyed because
this guy has been pressure washing his
house for very long and I'm very cold I
wish that you guys could feel how cold
it was in my house my legs I wish you
could see they have so many goose bumps
on them he's started pressure washing
again this is horrible I hope that you
guys had an amazing Christmas I hope
that you spent it with your friends and
families and I just want to show you
guys some of the stuff that I got
because I think these videos are really
fun and these videos are helpful if you
need some ideas for presents to give
your friends and families for their
birthdays or next Christmas so I just
have a little pile sitting here and I'll
just pick things up randomly of what I
see so the first thing on top of my
little pile is this hat and Marx's
grandmother actually got me this hat his
grandmother and his aunt and I love this
hat so much let me see if it will focus
on the material it's like this what
don't focus on me focus on the hat it's
like this really cool suede black
material I love this hat so much I mean
my hair wouldn't go with it very well
right now but um it's just really cute
and simple and I thought that was so
nice that his grandmother and his aunt
picked this out for me I think that's so
sweet so I'm gonna be getting a ton of
these out of that hat and my dad
actually tried to steal this hat from
because he really wanted it but I said
no dad you can't have this hat the next
thing is also from marks and Anson
grandmother and it's this dress that I
was wearing in my vlog from the other
day it's this long-sleeve plaid flannel
dress it's so soft and it's just really
easy and comfy to wear I think it looks
really cute with Congress or whatever
show you want to wear with it and it's
just really cute I think this is from
Target I am not really sure where they
got it but I love this so much I'm gonna
get a ton of wear out of it I've already
worn it once already and then the next
present is from Marcus and this was such
a thoughtful present he really did very
good at getting me very thoughtful gifts
this year this is what he got me this is
a film camera and if you don't know what
film cameras are they're like old-school
you have to get the film developed
they're not just like digital cameras
that you just take it and you can see
the picture right away and there's
something really special about film
photography just because like the
quality of it is just so different like
the lighting and just the emotion of the
pictures is a lot different than just
digital cameras um but I'm really
excited to learn how to use this because
I'm not very sure how to use it yet
um but yeah I'm so excited and I'm going
to take this on my honeymoon and take
really cute pictures and I'm just really
excited this was a very very thoughtful
gift the next thing is also something
Marcus got me and it's this little dog
let me see if it will show you the
little dog it's a little toy Golden
Retriever and he got me this because he
knows how bad I want a dog but this
Christmas we can't get one because we
want to get a dog when we're married and
living together so he got me this as
like a little placeholder for saying one
day you will have Louisville nursery and
his name will be Willoughby next present
is this candle and this candle I believe
was from TJ Maxx Marx's sister Shelby
got it for me and if you guys know me
you know I love copper and this candle
smells so good it smells like a boy it
smells like a boy after he
like his aftershave or his like
deodorant or cologne but it smells so
good and I think that this is going to
be a really good scent for when me and
Marcus live together so sometimes I can
burn my super sweet smells but sometimes
I'll also burn like more boyish smells
and it just looks really cute sitting on
my desk and I really really love it so
Thank You Shelby and another thing from
Marcus's family is this and this is a
2017 planner and it's marble and you
guys know I love marble and it's so cute
it has a little coconuts here and then
it has all the lungs and just it's just
like a regular planner but I thought it
was really sweet that they knew that I
love marble and this is like the perfect
size I can really write a lot of good
stuff in here so I'm really excited for
that the next thing is so cute this is
from my almost sister-in-law Lexi and
she got me this little bralla this is
from Victoria's Secret and it has a
really cute little cross back and I love
braless I think that they're so comfy
and I love the color of this one it's
like a really pretty soft nude pink
color and this color is my favorite kind
of color to wear um for bralette and I
just really loved it and something
unique about it is that it hooks in the
front and that's just so easy and
convenient I love that so I'm really
happy about this this was such a sweet
and thoughtful present okay so the next
present and here is this what could this
be this is from Marcus another very
thoughtful gift and when you open it up
it's a little calligraphy set which is
so nice it has a bunch of different pins
and little nibs and for different ink
and if you guys don't know I love doing
calligraphy it's one of my favorite
hobbies and I've been practicing it a
ton lately and a lot of you guys have
actually asked for like a calligraphy
video and I'll definitely do that once I
get better but I thought that this was
really thoughtful because really I only
have like one or two different
calligraphy nibs which are what these
little things are called
and now I have like every single style
which is so cool and different colored
inks like right now I only have black
but now I have red and I also have blue
this is by the brand speedball and I'm
sure you can find this at like any craft
store but if you're a beginner at
calligraphy I think that this would be a
really cool set to get I almost forgot
one of the things that I got for
Christmas is actually on my hand right
now my dad got me this ring from Davey
ermine let me see if it'll focus it's
just like it's one ring but it's like
all bunched together so it looks like a
bunch of rings what a really cool story
about this is that I actually had a
friend that had this ring and I loved it
so much and she told me is from Davey
ermine and I would go to the store and
look for it and it was never there but I
never told either of my parents that I
loved it but this Christmas he picked
out this ring that I thought was like
discontinued or something and he knew I
would love it and this is really special
so that was one of my favorite Christmas
presents and I'm never going to take
this ring off so now I can have a ring
on both my hands for my two favorite men
in the whole wide world which makes me
very happy
the next president is from my mom and
dad and this is also a very thoughtful
gift it is a digital ultrasonic cleaner
and this is for jewelry which I thought
was really nice because I always
complain about how I never get my
wedding ring cleaned and it gets all
cloudy and I'm like I need to get it
cleaned I need to get it cleaned so they
got me a jewelry cleaner which is so
nice and this looks like a really good
one ultrasonic sounds legit and the last
present have to show you guys today is
actually what I'm sitting on right now
and this is a throw from Anthropologie
you're not going to really be able to
see it that well because it's so huge
but it's so big and it's so pretty it's
a really pretty cream color with white
Fluffy's and some tassels at the end um
and oh it's so cute my mom got this for
me for Christmas
and it was really sweet because we were
in anthropology together and I saw that
throw and I was like wow that's such a
pretty throw I love to have that in the
house with me Marcus Avenue has together
and she's like yeah yeah it's really
pretty and and then I didn't think that
she got it but she surprised me with it
and I loved it so much so that was
really sweet and this is definitely my
coziest Christmas present because okay
