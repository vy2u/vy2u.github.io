hey guys today I'm going to be doing a
little Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys to leave me
some questions on snapchat and on
Twitter and I won't snapchat right now
and it seems as though it's Oh it
questions are coming in quickly so I'm
gonna try to answer as many as I can um
if you guys don't follow me on snapchat
or Twitter make sure you go follow me
over there I update you guys a ton of
those platforms more than I do on
YouTube so yeah go follow me on there if
you haven't so I'll start with some
snapchat questions um I don't know what
to choose their Soviet cheese from okay
oh oops I just clicked on one and then
it went away it is the first one okay
here we go
colors for wedding you're gonna be I
love your videos Wow ten out of ten so
stinking cute okay I don't really have a
main palette set I just know that I want
earthy light colors at my wedding so I
don't really know if that is a good
answer for that question but I would
just say greenery copper and white those
are my colors those are colors right hi
either this one anywhere you got your
jump right so nice oh oh she's from
Ireland okay she asked where I got my
jumper from um I got this from Express
actually I never shop at Express but on
Cyber Monday I saw that they were having
a huge sale and I saw this sweater and
it's so cute it has like a super big
turtleneck and uh it has like this like
little thing down the side I don't know
it's just super cute it's so cozy
um and I actually saw it on their
website last night so I'll link it down
below if you want to look at it but um
yeah so cozy and I love this color this
is like one of my favorite colors to
wear so express hi Christian my question
is what are you studying at University I
love you so um I get this question a ton
I'm studying media communications and I
have my minor in English editing
and media so those are my two little
major and minor I graduate December 16th
and I'm so excited I really like it and
I mean it fits perfectly with what I'm
doing media communications YouTube kind
of goes hand in hand
hey my question is what is your go-to
lipstick Thanks video oh my gosh you
guys are the cutest people okay uh my
go-to lipstick well currently my go-to
lipstick is a liquid lipstick um I love
that they're not I really like the look
of matte lipsticks and I really like
that they stay on super long um and I
actually have a confession to make my
favorite liquid lipstick is the Kylie
cosmetics lip kits I think that they're
amazing that's what I'm wearing right
now I'm wearing ginger lip liner mixed
with the orange all one I think it's
called 22 and I've been wearing this
combination a lot also I really like the
color party line from Mac I just thought
that while I was in an airport the other
day and I've been wearing that a lot too
so those two are probably my top two
favorite lipsticks right now next
question check but I wanted to know
where you were going to get married I'm
from Argentina and I love you oh she's
so cute
okay I get sit up everyone that's
probably gonna be annoying but just know
every video I think is so cute okay so
where am I getting married I'm getting
married in Florida a lot of people ask
if we're getting married in California
or Florida and we are getting married in
Florida and a lot of people also ask um
what day we're getting married but we
want to keep that a surprise so one day
you're just going to open your Instagram
feed and bam I'm gonna be made ooh
crazy girl 53 hey Kristen I love you and
your videos excuse my hot mess
I'm so lied about her where are you at
work is going on your honeymoon we're
actually trying to figure out where
we're going on our honeymoon um it's
I'm really sad because we wanted to go
to Greece for our honeymoon but since
we're getting married
kind of in the wintertime in 10 we can't
really go to Greece because it's going
to be cold and we want kind of like a
more tropical vibe to our honeymoon so
we're thinking maybe Tahiti or like Fiji
or somewhere just super-fun and tropical
me and Marcus both love really
adventurous things so anywhere where we
can like go hiking and like swimming and
I really want to swim with a turtle so I
think I could do that you probably I
like that question
um I think Mia Marcus's relationship
have been very very different than many
other people's relationships just
because we met when we were in college
while I'm still in college but we met
when he was still here at FSU and just
about like four months after knowing him
he moved to LA so we've pretty much been
doing long-distance across the country
for our entire relationship and I think
that I knew that he was one when he
decided to move to LA and he told me he
sat me down like I have really big news
like I think that you're probably gonna
be really sad but I believe that our
relationship is gonna last through this
and I want to pursue a long-distance
relationship with you and my goal in
this is to get married and I feel like
when a guy sits you down and tells you
his clear intentions and you both feel
so strongly about each other and he
tells you that his ultimate goal is to
marry you and obviously your ultimate
goal is to marry him
then I feel like I feel like then then
you know you got a good one but I think
that's a moment that like solidified um
that I knew that he was the one but
really when we first met on my first
date we talked about getting married so
there's that
question is where do Marcus go on your
first date and you go to dinner movies
what did it look like okay so me and
marks his first date I don't know if
I've talked about this on my channel
before um but our first date he took me
to dinner
at this place called Andrews 2 to 8 here
in Tallahassee and then afterwards um he
picked me up in his humungous truck if I
could find a picture of it I'll put it
like here or something because that was
the most massive truck ever um and then
he took me to like this construction
site and he started off-roading on all
of the construction mounds which you're
totally not allowed to do and I'm just
like wow this guy is actually crazy and
after we did that for like 15 minutes
then we went to my friend's house and we
had a game night and that's the way in
my heart is a game night because I love
games and after the game night we went
on to a coffee shop and sat there and
talked for like 5 hours and then the
coffee shop had closed and we went to my
dorm and talked for like 5 more hours
and we were seriously out to like 5:00
in the morning on our very first date
and yeah that was our first date my
question is how many pairs of socks do I
love that question how many pairs of
fuzzy socks do I own I think I don't own
any fuzzy socks I'm wearing some
slippers right now but that's not the
same as fuzzy socks on you what are you
most excited for about moving it was
Marcus I think the thing that makes me
the most excited about moving in with
Marcus is just knowing that I can be
with him all the time our whole
relationship has been like always saying
goodbye always winning another month to
see each other again and I just think
it's gonna be so happy when we can just
be like good night see you in the
morning wake up good night see you in
the morning wake up and not have to be
always like dreading the day that we
have to say bye again I think that's
gonna be the happiest thing yeah I'll
get one more question here on snapchat
and then I'll move over to Twitter
because I know some of you guys asked
over there okay
just wondering how you balance college
life okay so she asked um how do i
balance my personal life my school life
I think she said and my relationship
with God um that is my biggest struggle
right now I'm serious it's about to be
finals week I have a bajillion things to
do with like wedding planning and I'm
trying to do my best here on YouTube and
social media and continuously post and
have new stuff out for you guys I think
that my biggest advice for kind of like
juggling everything that you have going
on in your life is just prayer and time
management because that's really all you
can do sometimes like for me right now I
feel like I have so much on my plate and
so much to do at all times
sometimes I do just have to say no to
some things or I have to sacrifice
something so I can get other things done
but that's my biggest advice just prayer
and time management okay somebody asked
what is my best childhood memory um I
had a really happy childhood I grew up
in Baton Rouge Louisiana so I was raised
very southern um oh there's so many
memories how do I choose um I would say
probably one of my favorite memories is
growing up with a huge walnut Reaver his
name was max we also had another one
named Samantha but max was huge like he
was a lion dog he had super curly hair
which I've never seen on a golden
retriever before I'll try to find a
picture of him he was the sweetest
gentlest giant ever and I used to get on
his back and ride him everywhere I used
to put bows in his hair and he was just
like my best friend
he was such a good dog and Samantha was
such a good dog too um but I just have
so many memories with Max and I think
that he is one of the most special
things that I can think of when I look
back at my childhood the last question
is what is your favorite worship song
and right now my favorite worship song
is probably ever be and
um it's sung by a lot of different
people I don't know who like the
original singer is let me look on my
Spotify of which version I like the best
one moment okay so the version that I
usually listen to is ever be live by
Kali
Huygens all hi I'll go oh I can't
pronounce her last name but I'll leave
it down below so you can look it up it's
super amazing it always makes me cry
every time I listen to it it's just an
amazing song it really touches you so if
you're looking for a really good worship
song ever be by Callie Haley Blumenthal
is really good okay guys that is all the
questions I can answer today I've been
filming for over an hour now so
