vlogging and I've never vlog before and
I'm paired with Marcus we're at his
house in LA I've been telling you guys I
have a big surprise and it's actually
that me and Marcus are leaving today and
we're driving to Canada and so we're
getting all packed up looks kind of
crazy in here right now because we have
so much stuff because we're gonna be
camping and it's gonna be like a 24 hour
drive so we're leaving today
we're so excited we're about to load up
the car and yeah so I'm gonna take you
guys along with us and I'm probably
gonna vlog like two days upload it two
more days upload it kind of like that so
we're starting here in LA I actually
won't even really know where we're going
everybody we're gonna go to go straight
oh yeah
through the Rockies Montana Montana
we're like way left here right near
Calgary yeah
and this is where we're ending up good
old Canada Kristin is getting her
official first time black bandanna
around her neck I don't really want it
but she really wants it Oh Kristin you
it just makes you feel a certain way
that when you start wearing it for a
little bit you'll know exactly what that
means
mine's a little more worn and rugged you
look so cute oh my god
I feel like a cowgirl we are all packed
up if you can see there is
so much stuff in the back of this
beautiful but we are on our way we
actually decided to stop in Las Vegas
because I've never been there and also
some of Marcus's friends are there and
we kind of got a late start today so we
don't want to drive too far today and
Las Vegas is only like four hours yeah
so I'm going to Vegas for the first time
ever it is traffic traffic time because
la is traffic time all the time on a
Saturday
breathing pretty girl who's the worst
longer ever me house hips go last night
we were in Las Vegas and I forgot to
vlog any of it so I'm sorry about that
one we're up to a great start videoing
but um last night was really fun we hung
out with a bunch of Marcus's friends and
we had a really cool restaurant show me
around
I got yelled at a walk
we've been driving all day
Cracker Barrel and Carmel is so good so
I mean all day it's like three o'clock
this card looks like something I would
do to biscuit leaf or more and you're
just playing egg now the Moose what is
that
that chunk little chunk oh oh oh my gosh
blasted look at that chunk of snow
my job
my snow would you say I'm a good travel
partner or do I stink too much
definitely
make the contacts
and we are about three hours from Salt
Lake City where we're going to stop
tonight
I'm serious
people got stuck and they bus a little
bit but it's my choice for these people
anyways I saw this car they explained to
me film it explained to me that they
hydroplane and lost control and spun out
and landed right there thank God they
didn't flip their car there we go
I'm just going to end the vlog here and
this one for today but I hope you guys
are Mikey
more exciting because we have made this
nation that we want to go to yet so I'm
gonna get better at walking I have to
just remember
I think that vlogging is turning on the
camera and recording at the times you
don't want to but the times you don't
want it were the best times too far
makes it accents
within the next two days
late</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
