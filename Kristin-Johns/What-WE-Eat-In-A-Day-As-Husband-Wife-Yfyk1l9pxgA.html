morning it's about ten o'clock I think
I'm not near a clock so I'm not really
sure what time it is but I think it's
around ten o'clock I am going to be
filming a video today for you guys that
has been highly requested I'm going to
be showing you guys what I eat in a day
or what I ate today or what I eat in a
day I don't really know what these
videos are called but basically I'm just
going to be showing you every single
thing that I am going to be eating today
I like watching other youtubers videos
like this because it kind of gives you
some different food ideas and it kind of
gives you a little insight to their life
so I definitely wanted to film this to
you guys because I know a ton of you
want to see it but also I was a little
bit nervous to do it because I know
people sometimes get offended at what I
eat in a day videos because oh god I
hear in my mouth because I know some
people don't agree with some people's
food choices and things like that but if
you are one of those many people that
wanted to see this video definitely keep
watching
I already made a big mistake by making
myself some tea and I didn't even show
myself making it so I'll just let you
know now there's a dog hair on my cup
and we don't even have a dog so I don't
know how it was possible but I just made
myself a little cup of tea it's
peppermint to you with a tiny bit of
plenty in it and I was just drinking
this while I got ready for the day put
some makeup on by the way today me and
Marcus are going to a huge wildflower
field here in California and it's
supposed to be really really beautiful
so we're going to be driving there today
and I'll also walk a little bit and show
you guys that because that's going to be
really pretty okay so now I'm going to
go make myself some breakfast I'm also
going to be making Marcus and breakfast
we usually don't eat the same breakfast
because I have the same breakfast every
single morning and he doesn't eat dairy
because he's lactose intolerant so I'm
talking too much let me shift into the
video okay let's go make some breakfast
so basically this is what I eat for
breakfast every single morning little
Chobani Greek yogurt and then I put in
some dark chocolate chips some granola I
love this journal it's very delicious
um some chia seeds some coconut a banana
oh and I also have some honey with it so
grab the honey um in I just mix that all
together and that's pretty much what I
eat every single morning and I'll show
you how I make it this is what my
breakfast looks like pretty much every
single morning guys I can't really
explain to you how much I love this
breakfast but I just makes me feel
really happy I actually go to sleep
looking forward to this breakfast in the
morning this is what March says favorite
breakfast is made of it is the
tradeshows shred hash browns and I cook
those in the skillet right there three
eggs which I like scramble up and put in
the bowl half an avocado and some
sriracha sauce so I just mix that all in
a bowl and he really loves it oh yeah
she cooked me that that goes up in my
mouth yeah yeah that's in my mouth that
goes Wow I found out something maybe by
now I haven't been chewing my food all
the way I usually just eat very very
fast I'm like and I've been guessing
like a lot like I just always been like
a very gassy person and as soon as I
started chewing my food at a slow normal
pace my gas completely went away so I
was literally swallowing air to those
meetings with that I had to remind him
to breathe in the middle of eating huh
hey guys so me and Marcus has never told
you this but we actually have whoa very
bright we actually have some pet
squirrel they're wild with it still
happens
and they have to eat too so this is
their breakfast hmm buon appetito
squirrel
he loves his breakfast we're at the
poppy field look at them they're so
pretty
yep this hasn't even the most of them it
was back there that was the most of them
you think great here's what each
individual one looks like couple of very
adorable some are even kind of yellow so
we just got done at the poppy fields and
now it's like 4 o'clock and we haven't
eat anything since breakfast
then we stop at this little place along
the way home
Patricia shows grill and pasta ok so I
ordered a salad with salmon favorite
salad we also got some bread which I
definitely will need salmon potatoes
would you get smoked chicken I love
finding as little hole-in-the-wall
places that end up being so good I feel
like we do that a lot
mm-hmm we always find little places oh
and we both just got water to drink
Marcus usually gets lemonade but oh my
gosh he's been cutting back on lemonade
my friend for one of our wedding gifts
to give us a literal lifetime supply of
lemonade like Herbert 300 bottles so now
I'm going to have some enameling I have
a chilled I would say you at restaurants
and stuff we always try to order a
little bit healthy I mean those are you
know kind of the barbecue sauce yeah
that has a lot of sugar in it but mine
so we've run into a little bit of a
problem because we ate lunch kind of
late and it was a
lunch so now we don't really know with
you for dinner okay so I think I'm just
gonna make me and Marcus a big hearty
smoothie and I've got some secret
recipes for smoothies that y'all might
really enjoy so I'll show you how I make
them so I always make my smoothies in a
nutribullet
first I get the big cup through the
nutribullet the big one and then I got
my nutribullet right here so this recipe
is very simple all you need is one
banana ooh a fresh banana into your
nutribullet then you need some dates
I love dates they add really nice
texture and sweetness to your smoothie
so I usually put in there depending if
I'm making it for just me or just Marcus
or both of us I'll put in usually like
four and then I add my frozen berry mix
which these are from Trader Joe's it's
just a little packet of mixed berries
and this has like blackberries
blueberries and raspberries in it and
it's very good so I usually just add
about that much and then I also add some
frozen strawberries which are also from
Trader Joe's so this is what my smoothie
looks like so far and then I have some
unsweetened almond milk I get the
vanilla unsweetened time shake it up and
then I add about this much so that it
all blends together very easily my shell
cups are getting something but I can't
think of what I'm forgetting and then
you should have something that looks
like this this beautiful berry color and
this is usually enough for me and Marcus
to UM split so I just pour it in and the
secret about me is that I always give
Marcus the half that's bigger because I
know he's a growing man and I probably
couldn't finish
anyway so I always give him the bigger
half of whatever I make and then the
last step of your student email is you
get out your chia seeds and you put a
little bit of those sprinkled on top to
true decoration added he'll then I also
add some coconut flakes or shavings I
don't only like the slimming flake and
that it makes it look more beautiful and
appetizing and there we have it your
good delicious little smoothies I'll get
a better angle this dinner asked John
house tonight here's your dinner if
you're still hungry I'll make you
something else
but is it good very good okay guys that
was everything that we ate today sorry
