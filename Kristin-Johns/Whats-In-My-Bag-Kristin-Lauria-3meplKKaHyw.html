what's in my purse video and I saw a ton
of you guys have requested this video so
I started looking at some other people's
what's in my bag videos and oh my gosh
it is the most addicting thing ever to
see what is it other people's purses so
I hope you guys had a great Christmas in
New Year's I had a really good one I got
to spend Christmas with my sister and I
got to spend New Year's with Marcus and
his family so it was really fun I hope
you guys all had a really happy holiday
season
and I can't believe it's 2016 it really
just feels like two years ago it was
2000 and now it's 2016 and I just can't
comprehend that that was 16 years ago
but anyways I hope you all enjoy this
video and let's just get started so this
is my purse um it's a pretty small purse
and I actually got it in Copenhagen
Denmark when I was there visiting my
sister and I got it at us like a flea
market thrift store kind of thing so I
think it was only like ten dollars but I
think that it's real leather and it just
has some cool like prints on it and I
really like it I've been using it for
about two years now so it's probably
just about time for me to get a new
purse but this is it this is the inside
of it and even though it's small I shove
a lot of stuff in here so um let's just
get started in what's inside so the
first thing I have in my bag is my phone
and I actually got this phone case from
brandy melville and I was only like ten
dollars or eight dollars or something
but I like it because it's really slim
it's really cute even though it does not
protect my phone very well but that's
okay the second thing I see in here is
my headphones these are just the regular
apple headphones I don't really know if
I like these headphones very much they
kind of hurt my ears but they came with
my phone so these are the ones I use
they're always tangled and yeah I need a
soul
for that problem the next thing I have
in here are my keys
I Drive a Toyota and um I have my little
episode singing on here is guys look how
cute my house key is it's a little house
on my key so that's how I know that's my
house key for Tallahassee and I also
have my p.o box key something else
that's all my keys that I think that you
guys might like is this tile and you can
actually get an app on your phone the
tile app it's like a little GPS tracker
so you can go on your phone and it will
play a noise if you can't find your keys
it can put it on anything that you lose
on a regular basis and for me that's my
keys and it will help you find them so I
love that the next thing I have in here
is my wallet and this isn't it is very
old I think got this like four years ago
from Anthropologie and what is in here
oh of course it should pull a receipt I
just have all my cards in here um I have
some chick-fil-a coupons a Sephora
receipt that is very long I really like
this wallet because it holds so much
stuff and this kind of different how it
has two different buttholes and I just
have some cash so that is a bonus next
thing I have in here is this and this is
the Josie Maran Argan infinity lip and
cheek creamy oil it's like the cutest
tiniest little bottle and I actually
think I got this as a sample from
Sephora like a hundred point perk or
something and I really like it I've been
using it as chapstick because it's
really moisturizing and yes so that's in
there I also have these eye drops
because I do wear contacts and they get
dry sometimes these are the roto cool
version and they like ice cubes going
into your eyes which I love but I know
everything one of my friends that I've
tried to make use this
hate it because they say it feels way
too cold in their eyes but I love it and
yes I very much recommend this for
anybody who wears contacts or suffers
from red eyes because this will solve
all your problems the next thing in my
bag is my sunglasses and I actually got
these not too long ago I got them from
Nordstrom and I really like them because
they're the cat eye shape and I never
had sunglasses like that so I really
like these I don't remember the brand
but I'll link all the things that I
mentioned in this video and the downbar
so if you want to try anything you can
do that and yeah these are my sunglasses
do you like them I hope do I like thing
in my purse is a whole bunch of lip
products I always when I'm doing my
makeup in the morning I just throw the
lip product that I'm using in my purse
and then I forget to clean it out so I
have the buxom dolly lip gloss I really
love that one I also have buxom baby
version of Sofia which these look the
exact same
but anyways and I have the Tarte I also
have the tarte lipsurgence natural matte
lip tint and Hope and I love this color
it's just a really pretty like it's like
a brighter mob color so I really like
that one I also have all of these keep
rolling off my bed I also have the
Sephora luster matte long-wear lip color
and this is in fig and guys I just found
these lip products and they are amazing
I'll swatch it for you oh this is
actually what I'm wearing today on my
lips but it's just the perfect color
everyday color and it dries I would say
semi matte but it's so comfortable on
your lips it just feels like nothing's
on your lips I also have my favorite lip
color of all time this is max cream in
your coffee cream in my coffee cream in
your coffee and I'll also swatch this
for you I would say this color is a
little bit more sheer than that
and it's a little bit more rosy and I
really really love this this is also one
of my favorite lip colors of all time as
you can see Mavi colors are BAE I also
got this for Christmas so I stuck it in
my purse and this is a mini lint roller
and this is the perfect gift because
biscuit my cat sheds on me way too much
so this is perfect for the go because I
always have dog or cat hair all over me
I also have a pinch the regular old pin
I have this perfume
it's the rollerball of Chloe and guys
this perfume smells amazing mmm it
smells like flowers I also have this
which was another sample from Sephora
and it's the Josie Maran pure argon milk
and I was using this when me and Marcus
went skiing because my skin got so dry
from the freezing air so I think this
worked very good because it's an
intensive hydrating treatment so I
really really liked this and I'm going
to keep using it when my skin's really
dry so cute little baby I have a target
receipt love target I have oh I have a
little Christmas tag in here that never
want anybody but this is so cute this is
a really cute tag stocking but this
should not be a memory last thing I have
in here is a movie ticket and me and
Marcus actually went and saw joy and it
was really good and I freaking love
Jennifer Lawrence I think she is amazing
