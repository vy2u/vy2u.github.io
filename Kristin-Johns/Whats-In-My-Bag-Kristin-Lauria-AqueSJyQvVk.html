you what is in my bag but before I do
that I just want to say and really
excited as this video is super late I
usually post a video every single week
but this one is like four days late
which I was really sad about but that's
because I was on vacation with my family
in North Carolina and we had such a good
time they were a little out of focus on
spending some quality time with them so
I didn't have a chance to post the video
and we didn't have any service either so
I couldn't really post the video anyway
but I do have good news and I'm going to
be posting a new video every single
Wednesday and I'm going to try to be one
every single Sunday as well I haven't
had a posting schedule in so long so I
thought it was good to just commit to
one day and then another day that could
be like my extra video so look out for
new videos Wednesdays and Sundays for me
I think that that would be very helpful
for you guys so I'm not just posting on
random days I really wanted to show you
guys what's in my purse because like I
said I've been traveling a lot and
there's a lot of stuff in here and I
don't really know what's in here but I
think that these videos are very fun so
this bag is from Urban Outfitters it's a
little backpack and I really like to
carry around backpacks lately because I
feel like since I do put a lot of stuff
in my purses that it doesn't hurt my
shoulders as much and it's just a little
bit more like casual and comfy so like I
said this one's from Urban Outfitters I
didn't get it too long ago so if I can
find it on their website I'll link it
down below but it's really cute it's
just black leather it has some tassels
and some stitching down here which i
think is cute and it holds a box which
is what I like about it this is what's
inside of my bag it's kind of like um a
bit so the first thing I have in here is
my cell phone and I have the gold 7 um
and my background is my little dog so
you I got one of those tempered glass
screen protectors I don't know if you
can tell but if you ever drop your phone
or scratch it
the glass screen that you put on top of
it is actually the one that bridge to
get sketch so I really like that and you
can get the first super treat from
Amazon so that's very good and then I
also just got a
clearcase from Amazon because I like the
color the gold color is very pretty so
that's myself and then I have my wallet
which I actually had in my last what's
in my first video which I did like ten
months ago or something like that
this is from Anthropologie from a very
long time ago and I like it because it
has a little place for your cash and
then it also has a place for your cards
so that's truly nice and the next thing
I have in here are my glasses they're
from Warby Parker um this is what they
look like they're just regular little
glasses and it feels very weird I have
my contacts in so now I really can't see
anything but I have diverse vision
that's just a fun fact about me I think
I have negative six eyesight in both
eyes so have very bad eyesight and the
next thing I have in here is some gum
and I have the dentine ice toughness
flavor which I really like and I always
get the huge jars of gum because every
single time you pull out your gum and
the single person around you want some I
also have this which is the best thing
ever I have no idea where to buy one of
these because benefit sent me this but
it's like a little portable ring light
for your phone so you just click the
button on top and there's three
different brightnesses but it's just a
little ring right and you clip it to
your phone like this and I use this a
lot when I'm doing like snapchat stories
at nighttime or something like that but
it's so helpful and it's just really
cute I've never seen one of these before
so when they send it to me I was like
what the heck I just love this so much
so I keep it in my purse
and I also sometimes use this as a
flashlight to fun in my first also have
my beep powerless wire headphones I
think I have a specific name but I don't
know the name of them and these
headphones have changed my life when it
comes to working out because they stay
in your ear and there's not like wires
all around getting connected to your
phone and like these just are very
convenient and they really help me work
out so I like to keep these in my purse
also have some regular headphones too
but last night actually painted the ends
of my little headphones a different
color because me and Marcus always get
ours mixed up so I painted mine purple
and I painted his some other color if
you have someone in your life that you
always think is stealing your headphones
just take a little bit of nail polish
and paint the ends and it works like a
charm
did you guys ever hear do like old wives
tale that when your nose itches it means
someone wants to kiss you my mom always
used to tell me that and now every
single time my nose itches I'm like
market do you want to kiss me the next
thing I have in my purse are my
sunglasses and these are from disk I
wear there's a dime - this is what they
look like on their base cute I think
that they're polarized which is a
fantasy um but I just keep these in my
purse and this random little um case I
also have this little Kylie lip kit
carton in here I don't have an actual
liquid lipstick in here but I just have
the lip liner I actually don't know
where the liquid lipstick is but that
makes me sad because I actually really
like this color also I'm very sorry
as'll lighting keeps changing I think
the clouds keep going over the Sun and
it's making it blue then bright and dark
so I'm sorry about that but the next
thing I have in here is a ton of lip
products and I don't know if y'all are
going to want me to go through all of
these one by one
but I will and then you can just skip a
little bit through if you don't want to
see all the freaking lipsticks that I
have in my first thing is I get ready in
the morning and I put on the lipstick
that I want and then I throw the
lipstick that I'm wearing in my purse
and then I just never take it out so I
have three MAC lipsticks I have the
shade cream in your coffee world and so
and I'll flush them off for you and I'm
just going to say right now I probably
have all about the same shade of
lipstick in my first because I really
like mommy pink colors so they're all
different to me but you probably can't
tell the difference this year a normal
human being so at the top one right
there is whirl and then cream in your
coffee and then so and then I
also have the Kylie lip kit and ginger
which I thought I had lost but now I can
put it back in a cool carton this is
just a really pretty like dark it's like
a dark brown pink and I also have a
liquid lipstick from NYX and it's the
lip lingerie in the color 0 for lips Lee
and then I also have a colour-pop liquid
lipstick in the shade Colette so this
one is the Kylie lip kit oh there's a
fly a little bit this one is the NYX lip
lingerie and likley and this is the
shade Calypso by colourpop's
all pretty much the same kind of shade
and then I also have I also have two
dates lipstick in sweet maple and then
last but not least I have the pollen gel
lipstick I'm actually not sure what the
shade is of this because you kind of
have to take the label off to put it in
a full carton but first of all pollen
does packaging is just so cute every
single time I use this lipstick in
public I feel like someone always says
oh my gosh what kind of lipstick is that
because it's just so too but this is the
shade sweet maple by Too Faced and this
is the pollen gel one so as you can see
I have way too many lipsticks in my
purse and way too many of the same
shades in my purse but moving on I also
have the drunk elephant with the
chapstick which is this really cute like
tiny chubby chapstick and I use that all
the time and this is actually really
good to go under liquid lipsticks
because it's super thin but also very
moisturizing so I love this and then I
also have my all-time favorite chapstick
which is the Lucas's pawpaw pointment
this stuff is so good it's actually a
fermented papaya
and this is like super famous in
Australia I've heard like everybody in
Australia uses this because i
snapchatted it awhile ago and everybody
said to say you did who was in Australia
so I love this stuff it's really good
and I think it smells really good too oh
my gosh I have something really weird
here okay first I have
these little hair ties I just keep a ton
of these in here because I'm always
pulling my hair up in a ponytail because
it's too dang long and then I have a
little spoolie to brush out my eyelash
extensions because sometimes they get
kind of crazy so I just you know brush
through them like a little dog and keep
all the hairs in place this is so weird
I have some rocks in my purse and these
rocks are actually very special because
they're all rubies supposedly when we
are in North Carolina we went to this
place where you can actually like sift
through dirt to find your own little
gemstones at this place and this guy
said that these are all rubies so I
found a huge one he says that could be
worth a lot of money if you get it cut
by a jeweler so this is what my first
little ruby looks like and if I saw it
on the ground I would say oh that's just
a rock have those in here in case I ever
come across the jeweler to cut them open
for me so that then I can be making the
big bucks with the big like 20 carat
Ruby so that is everything in my purse I
really hope you guys like this video if
you did like this video please give it a
thumbs up I have some paper swatches on
my hand um but I will see you guys very
soon don't forget every Wednesday and
sometimes Sunday love you guys so much I
hope you have a great rest today and
I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
