video and I'm really excited about this
video um but first I just want to say
sorry that for the past few weeks I
haven't been able to upload a video been
so insane with school and I had all my
midterms the past few weeks and I also
had to do a speech in my speech class
which raise your hand if you hate speech
class so that is why I have not post a
video in a few weeks but don't worry I'm
back at it so with that out of the way
we should start the midea as you can
tell from the title this video is called
what's in my heart this video is kind of
gonna just be about things that I'm
learning things that I love things I'm
passionate about things that maybe I'm
struggling with um just stuff like that
so I hope you guys like this video so
yeah let's just get started the first
thing that I have been learning a lot
lately and something that has been on my
heart is self-acceptance
and self-confidence throughout my whole
life really I've struggled with the fact
that not everybody is gonna like me or
not everybody is gonna accept me for who
I am and there's always going to be
people that judge you and people that
have an opinion of you because
everyone's gonna have an opinion
everyone's gonna decide whether they
agree with what you say or don't agree
with what you say but I find that it's
really hard sometimes to just accept the
fact that you cannot make everybody
happy and I'm the kind of person I'm a
very big people pleaser and I hate
conflict I hate letting people down or I
just want everyone to be like happy with
what I do and when people don't like
what I do or don't like something about
me it really really affects me and I'm
like oh I need to change that because
they don't like it or I just feel like I
kind of like mold myself to how people
want me to be so lately God's been
teaching you a lot about the fact that
you can't make everybody happy and you
cannot expect every
you like what you're doing kind of in
freeing learning that because once you
realize that you can't make everybody
happy and once you stop trying to make
everybody happy I feel like that's when
you really grow into who you really are
and who God wants you to be especially
with social media I've been learning a
lot lately um kind of the effects of
social media and that this is a whole
nother thing that has been on my heart
lately is how much social media can just
take over your life and take over your
brain like always thinking about it I
can't get caught up with social media
and people's opinions of me and so
worried that I'm not making everybody
happier that not everybody likes me just
to find my security in Jesus and Who I
am and who I am through Jesus so that is
probably the biggest thing that I've
been learning lately and kind of working
through lately so I hope that kind of
relates to some of you guys something
else that has been on my heart a lot
lately and really for the past probably
a year and a half is being a
long-distance relationship and a lot of
people on here have commented that y'all
are in a long-distance relationship and
a lot of you have asked me to do an
entire video on my advice about one of
those interrelationships so maybe I'll
do that sometime the biggest thing that
I've been learning about long-distance
relationships lately is to be happy with
where you are you have to kind of change
your perspective about it because before
I had a really kind of negative outlook
on it just because I was like oh this is
the worst this stinks I'm away from him
and it's all just really sad and lives
3,000 miles away and I just was just sad
about it all time lately I've really
just been learning about how much a
perspective change can change your heart
to like you can change your feelings
about something so I've really been
trying to think of all the positive
things about long-distance like how I'm
lucky to have somebody that I love so
even though he lives far away I'm still
lucky to have him and have that
relationship and be able to FaceTime and
talk on the phone and stuff like that
and also just when I have it I get a
thought kind of trying to spin it in a
positive way like all this thing I hate
talking on the phone I like talking a
person way better but just thinking like
it's really lucky that you can talk to
him on the phone and like see him on
FaceTime it's tough because that's a
huge blessing because some people can't
do that at all so that is something huge
that's a huge piece of advice that I
have for those of you who are in a
long-distance relationship as a viewer
in long-distance relationships I'm
really sorry because it really stinks
but but we'll get through this together
comment down below if you're in a
long-distance relationship or if you
have a family member or a friend that
lives far away and we can just be one
big long-distance family and just
encourage each other and remind each
other that it will be ok so comment that
down below and I will love to read that
another huge thing that's been on my
heart is this channel and what I really
want it to be about and kind of my
vision for my youtube channel and I kind
of just wanted to share that with you
guys I really want there to be a way
where I can personally talk to you guys
and communicate with you guys on a
deeper level than just like the comments
section even though I love commenting
back to you guys and I was thinking
what's a better way than writing letters
to each other would that be so fun first
of all I just love letters and writing
people letters and people writing you
letters that would be the happiest but I
don't really know how to do that I guess
geobox would be the best way to do it
you guys think that's a good idea and if
you guys
if any of you guys would like to be like
pen pals and ride to other letters um I
love that so just comment down below if
you think that's a good idea and if what
enough of you said yes or even if like
final you say yes then I'll open a PA
box so we can start writing letters
together because that would be the
happiest thing ever anything ain't bad
is it for this video I hope that you
guys liked it I hope that you guys
learned a little bit more about me and I
hope that you guys can relate a little
bit to what I've been learning lately or
what I have been kind of thinking about
lately if you like this video just give
it a thumbs up and comment down below if
you want me to do more of these like
periodically kind of like a little
catch-up heart-to-heart for us because I
think that's important and so yes and
don't forget to subscribe if you like my
videos because I will be posting a new
video every week from now on I love you
guys so much and I hope you have a great
rest of your day and I will see you next
time hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
