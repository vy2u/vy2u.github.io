you what is in my travel makeup bag and
I actually just got back from LA cuz I
was visiting Marcus and so I still have
all my makeup pack and so I thought this
video might be helpful because it's kind
of hard to narrow down what makeup to
bring when you're going on a trip so
this is the makeup bag that I use to
keep my makeup in and this is the one
that I use to keep my brushes in this
one I got from Etsy and I just had my
monogram on it I will try to find the
exact seller that I bought this from
from Etsy and I'll link it down below if
I can find it in case you're interested
the first thing that I have in here is
an eyeshadow palette and it is an all
matte eyeshadow palette by the balm and
I love this so much because the pan
sizes are huge like you get so much
product in here I'm actually wearing it
on my eyes today and it's just really
nice because you can get a really
natural look with it and I really like
that it's all matte so this is the first
one I usually bring the second one I
always bring on trips is the lorac Pro
to go palette but if you guys follow me
on snapchat you can see that that got
shattered the black in it completely
crumbled and now the whole palette is a
mess that I'm trying to not think about
because I need to clean that all up so I
usually bring the lorac Pro to go
palette but I'm not going to show that
because then black eyeshadow will get
everywhere the second thing that I have
in here is my bronzer and I have been
using NARS Laguna bronzer as you can see
I've made a big dent in it
and I actually used to use this in high
school like every single day and I
completely forgot about it and I loved
it so much I feel like it just looks
really natural really easy to blend and
it's just an oldie but a goodie the next
thing that I have in here is my
highlighter and it's Becca's champagne
pop and this is also a sad story because
this shattered and now it is really
difficult to use so I need to like
repress it and all that stuff but my
biggest tip is don't check your makeup
bag because I did
for the first time and two of my makeup
products shattered so I'm not going to
do that anymore and I'm just gonna
always bring it carry on with me because
then it won't get shattered my next
thing that I have is my powder and I
love this powder so much it's what I've
been using for a while now and it's the
Laura Mercier translucent powder and I
really really like this I've been using
it for so long and it doesn't even look
like I made a dent in it so hopefully it
lasts for a long time and I just really
love this powder and I just use it to
set my makeup the next thing is my
mascara and I have been using the
covergirl LashBlast volume I also have
my primer my eyeshadow primer and I've
been using the NARS Pro prime smudge
proof eyeshadow base and I'm not joking
you guys this is the only I shadow base
that I've ever used that actually makes
my eyeshadow stay on the entire day the
next thing I have is a lip product and
it's number 14 and it's sephora's cream
lip stain and this is pigmented stuff it
literally stays on your lips for so long
until you take it off and it's a really
pretty like deep plum color
I also brought max MIDI mauve which I
showed you guys in my matte lipstick
swatches video and I love this color
it's so perfect for every single day the
next lipstick I have is by lipstick
Queen and I got this from my Ulta in
Orlando but I've never been another Ulta
that sells lipstick Queen but I'm pretty
sure they have it online but this is
actually comes like a blue color but on
your lips it changes to just like the
perfect pinky color and it's really
moisturizing I can't read the name on
the back because it's like dark blue and
the name is black so my eyes just can't
read it but I will find it and link it
below the next thing I brought is a
blush and the only one I brought was
tarts blushing bride and I just think
this is a perfect blush for every day it
really brightens up your complexion
because it's a
nice like cool toned pink color and I
just love this blush so much it might be
one of my favorite blushes of all time
and I love Tarte blushes because they're
so compact they only take up a tiny bit
of space so they're perfect for
traveling next I brought my eyebrow
powder and my little brush that I use
for it I use Anastasia soft brown
eyebrow powder and I love this I use it
every day and I couldn't go on a trip
without it oh and the brush I use is
Mac's
263 my Beauty Blender which I have been
loving so much lately I completely
forgot how amazing beauty blenders are
just makes your makeup look so flawless
and just really natural because of the
moisture and the sponge when you let it
it just feels so good I also brought my
clear brow gel which I use to set my
eyebrows with the concealer I brought is
the Maybelline age rewind and I got the
color light I also brought some tweezers
these are by tweezerman and I just used
them to tweeze my eyebrows and I also
brought my handy dandy Physicians
Formula I booster this is what I use for
eyeliner every single day and the last
makeup product is my foundation and this
is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation you guys know I love this so
much you have been asking what color I'm
in in this and I am in the color nude so
that is all of the makeup that I bring
it to travel and now I will show you the
brushes that I bring and before I start
with the brushes I showed you guys on
snapchat that I went to the morphe store
in Burbank and I got all of these and so
if you want to see like a morphe make it
brush haul then I will do that for you
because I've never tried morphe brushes
before so if you want to see a video
about all the brushes that I got and
what I think about them then just like
this video or comment down below and I
will definitely do that for you so these
are all of the brushes that I brought
with me at to California
I'll start with this one this one is
actually from Costco me and my mom got
like a brush set forever ago and this is
one of them and this brush is just
perfect for bronzer because it's pretty
big but I'm pretty sure it's natural
hair so it blends out the bronzer really
well I also brought this one in case I
wasn't using my Beauty Blender for
foundation and this is the Real
Techniques buffing brush I also brought
this brush for blush and this is the it
cosmetics blush brush I'm guessing
that's what it's called and this brush
is my favorite brush of all time for
putting on blush wow that is a tongue
twister I also brought this one which is
the Sephora Pro stippling brush and this
is just a nice little duo fiber brush
and it's perfect for blending everything
out applying powder really whatever you
want to do with it you can do with it I
brought the Sigma f-35 and I use this
for highlighter and I only brought three
eye shadow brushes I brought the Sigma
e45 which is just nice for getting
colors right in the outer corner of your
eye so brought the tapered blending
brush the e-40 and I just use this for
blending colors out in my crease and the
last brush is the Sigma F 75 and I just
use this for putting color on the eyelid
so that is all of the makeup that I
bring when I am traveling and before I
film this video I was like I did a good
job narrowing it down but actually now
I'm thinking about it it is a lot of
makeup so oops
hope you guys like this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and let me
know in the comments what you guys love
to bring when you're traveling and don't
forget to subscribe for a new video
every single Monday and I love you guys
and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
