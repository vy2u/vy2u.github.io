video for you and it's going to be an
unboxing video and I've never done one
of these videos before so this unboxing
video is for the subscription box
fabfitfun and i've heard a ton about the
subscription box on Instagram and other
youtubers but I've never tried it myself
and so this month I got this in the mail
and oh my gosh this is the cutest
package I've ever seen and fabfitfun is
a seasonal subscription box so it comes
four times a year and so this one is the
spring box and it looks so cute I love
the package when it came all my
roommates were like open it now and I
was like no I have to wait because I'm
doing an unboxing video so it has to be
a surprise it's about fifty dollars for
each box but it says that it's over like
two hundred dollars in value each box
and something that I love about this one
that I read about it I have it open this
yet and I've never gotten one before but
something that I thought was really good
is that it's all full-size products so
it's fashion beauty lifestyle fitness
all those kind of things which I love
and they're all full-size it came with a
little a little magazine in here I guess
I think this shows you with it but I
want it to be a surprise so I'm not
going to look but this girl I love her
flower crown so the first thing I see in
here is this Marrakesh oil argon and
hemp oil therapy hair styling elixir oh
my gosh and this is a glass bottle
that's really nice let me see what it
smells like I love when people try out
stuff that they get on camera cuz I'm
like what is it like so I will try it
out for you guys pump out a little bit
these things always take forever to pump
guys I'm not even kidding
this smells so good I've never smelt a
smell like that oh my gosh I'm gonna put
in my hair even if this didn't do
anything for my hair I'd still put it in
my hair because it smells so good but
it's an argan oil from Morocco combined
with hemp seed oil and it will improve
your hair's condition
and I love that so that's the first
thing you're here and that is worth 20
2.99 next thing in here is this and it
says is H contour kit light / medium ooh
sleek packaging huh and it's these
little I guess this is a highlighter
wait is this a highlighter
woo these are soft a highlighter
shimmery bronzer a matte bronzer and a
really pretty blush I love these so much
I shouldn't have done that because now I
don't have anything to wipe it on umm
$25 gift card for 31 bits calm I don't
know what that is Oh oh my gosh it says
every 31 bits piece is handmade by
artisans in Uganda who are earning an
income and receiving an education guys
that is literally what I want to do with
my life I want to open an orphanage in
an online store that helps widows and
people in poverty sell their stuff and
give the money back to them and that's
like what this is and it's a and it's a
$25 gift card for that okay alright I
love that okay next I see hello legs for
the softest shiniest sexiest smoothest
legs ever and I don't know what this is
I guess it's just a moisturizer
oh it's shaving lotion and this is 1995
so oh my gosh this reminds me of like a
fresh fruit patch like a fresh
strawberry orange citrus farm and I love
it and shaving jealous soaks in some
have you guys noticed that and I always
cut my legs so maybe this will help me
be a better shaver next thing in here is
I can't pronounce French things just a a
more love song and a bath bomb bath bomb
Trinity so I'm guessing there's three
bath bombs in here Q retailed for $28
and it's just little bath bombs and I
love

ingredients I love that so much the next
thing I see is sterling forever shine
bright $30 just for you okay so I guess
this is a jewelry store and they gave
you a $30 gift card and that's a lot of
money so love that and the next thing I
see in here is a necklace and this is so
cute it is called the tag necklace by
Duke and Nona and these retail for $65
oh my gosh this is so cute it's just
like a little dating necklace and it
says inspire on it I love it so much and
it says it's made from 18 karat gold
plated stainless steel engraved with
words to live by
I love that so much do you guys like it
I think it's so perfect I'm in love with
dainty necklaces and usually they're
from forever 21 but this is a step up in
my collection what is this this is the
body pure character gloves and soft nail
strengthening and skin nourishing I have
no idea what this could be a waterless
all in one hand and foot treatments that
strengthens nails and moisturizes the
skin with the benefits of keratin
whether you're at home on the go or on
the go these babies give you the easiest
mani and pedi treatment ever and these
retail for about $10 I wonder if I

what it looks like
whoo okay so they come in little
separate packages these are the socks
and these are the gloves I can't wait to
use easy they're so cute and they feel
all squishy inside I have no idea what
these will be like I'll snapchat a

I can smell them through the thing and
they smell so good
so I'm really excited to use these mat
