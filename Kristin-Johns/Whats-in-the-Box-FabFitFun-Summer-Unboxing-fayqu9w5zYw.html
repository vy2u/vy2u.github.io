really fun video for you I'm going to be
doing another unboxing video and I did
learn these videos a few months back
like it must have been three months ago
I did the Springboks for fabfitfun and
so today I'm going to do the summer
fabfitfun box and you guys are gonna
love the box it comes in because it is
the Shootist box I've ever seen this is
so stinking cute it has little
sunglasses and popsicles and it's just
so cute I seriously want like a phone
case with this pattern on it because I
love it so much so as I've said before
or fabfitfun is a subscription box and
it's $50 a box and there's four a year
because it's seasonal but they all come
with all full-size products and I'm just
really excited to open this because I've
been waiting to film this video and
let's just rip right into it here we go
okay woo okay so this is what it looks
like on the inside it comes with a
little magazine thing and it has a
little fabfitfun popsicle sugar holding
it all together so I don't know what's
in here I haven't like looked online or
anything but it comes with this little
magazine of a girl eating a popsicle the
first thing that I see in here is this
huge bottle and it's called stimulation
and it's a daily microderm scrub face
and body
I've heard of microderm but I don't
really know what it is let's see how it
smells has a little thing smells like
citrus like like oranges it smells
really good let's just see what it looks
like oh it has like the tiniest beads
ever I was expecting it to be like
bigger um little beads since it's
exfoliating but it's like tiny little
beads the next thing I see in here is
this and it's the gipset are luminous
lips and free spirit so it is a lip
gloss and this one retails for $18 and
it says that it's full of vitamin E
okay moment of truth I'm kind of scared
of this color honestly because it looks
like really shimmery but let's see what
it'll do like I think I could make this
work it's kind of like one of those Mavi
colors that I really like it's super
shiny so it'll probably make your lips
look really plump should I choose I see
this the fat pit fun everyday beach
waves conditioning texture light hold
spray and this just says make everyday a
beach day and apply to wet or dry hair
and it will give you like beachy waves
so that's really cool my hair is like
pin straight so nothing like this ever
seems to work for me but let's see how
it smells oh wait it's not really good
it's really light but I think I might
give this to my mom because she has
really pretty like beachy wavy hair and
so I think that she'll really like this
huh this looks really cute this is the
summer and Rose microfiber yoga towel
and this retails for 36 bucks which is a
lot of money so let's try to open it up
dang this is big so it's really cute
this one is supposed to be moisture
wicking so I think that means like it
absorbs moisture but doesn't feel like
wet when you touch it so that's really
nice because every single time I've
tried yoga I sweat my butt off but this
will come in very handy I really got to
keep practicing my yoga skills so this
will help me achieve that goal the next
thing I see is this and it's in a really
nice glass bottle and it says OC or osya
and it's atmosphere protection cream
I've never heard of atmosphere
protection cream but this says it is a
antioxidant rich moisturizer and it
creates a protective barrier on your
skin use day and night and it's an ideal
base for sunscreen and makeup so I guess
that this is just like something that
protects your skin from like the toxins
of the air and the pollutants so that's
really nice and let's see what it smells
like hmm like oh my god oh my nose it's
like a really light moisturizer and it
smells really good it smells like a Veda
haircare if you've ever smelled that for
us exactly what smells like I have no
idea what this is oh it's a Trina Turk
canvas tote and this retails for $55
dang that's a lot of money um this is
what it looks like it says what's it say
it says seize the day that's really cute
and I really like the handles of this
this is a really cute beach bag and it's
really nice material and pretty big last
big thing in here is this and it's this
box and it says bitch Nichols ice pop
molds vegetables they are champagne
bottle shaped ice pop molds and you fill
them with your favorite juice or maybe a
little bubbly and enjoy frozen
festivities all summer long and these
retail for $19 they are shaped like
little up they look like little
champagne bottles and they come with a
little stick okay so this is the last
few things that are in here they just
seem like little coupons or something
this first one is $35 off your first box
of Hello fresh so that's really cool and
I think hellofresh is like a
subscription service for food which
seems really cool so that's really nice
the next thing is this calm peed blister
cushion and I've had to use these before
and they actually work really well when
you're wearing shoes that don't fit you
very well or shoes that are just kind of
more uncomfortable it gives you a little
calm peed and also save dollar on your
next one so that's really nice and the
last thing I have is just two samples of
the Burt's Bees BB cream
they actually have $3 off coupons on
both of them so $6 altogether and I have
to shave light/medium I really want to
try this because I let break these
products a lot and I never knew that
they made face makeup okay so the total
value of the whole box is bunk but it um
two hundred and twenty-eight dollars
says it right there and I think that
that's a really good deal cuz you only
have to pay fifty dollars with each and
you get so much more in the box then
fifty dollars worth and also fabfitfun
was really nice and is giving you guys a
discount code for your first box so I
will link that down below I really hope
that you guys like this video if you
didn't like this video please give it a
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
to my channel for new videos every
single week and I love you guys so much
and I hope you have a great rest of your
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
