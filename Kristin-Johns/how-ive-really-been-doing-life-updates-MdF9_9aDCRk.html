there's a lot of construction going on
in my backyard which is right there and
they're blasting some music so I'm too
embarrassed to ask them to turn it off
and so if you hear a little bit of music
in the background that's what that is
I don't even know what this video is
gonna be honestly I just wanted to do
like a little life updates video you
know getting real with you guys because
I feel like those are the types of
videos that you guys resonate with the
most like every time I meet one of you
in person the video that you always talk
to me about is either like my testimony
video or videos where I've just been
super real and vulnerable with you guys
so I was like I need to do another one
of those because I haven't done one of
these in a long time
I also wanted to answer some of your
questions I asked on a live video on
Instagram the other day if you guys had
any questions for me to answer in this
video and I got a lot of questions so
I'll kind of give you at the life update
then I'll go into like a little Q&amp;amp;A so
where do I even begin since we've moved
into this house I feel like that's when
life has been like a whirlwind lately
because just everything everything has
been a lot to be honest I guess since
I'm kind of a perfectionist when it
comes to like decorating and like
keeping my house clean it's kind of
become like an added stressor on my life
because when I'm already stressed out
from work my stress manifests in like
cleaning and wanting everything around
me to look perfect
that's exactly how it was in high school
- when I have horrible anxiety like my
room always had to be absolutely perfect
or I would just like freak out so I kind
of feel like that is manifesting itself
into my house now so I feel like lately
I've really been trying to incorporate
balance into my life like I think God is
really just trying to say Kristin you
can say no to some things
Kristen you don't have to have
everything around you be perfect all the
time for you to feel sane I don't know
if any you guys ever feel
but that has been something like a
constant in my whole life like that
feeling of having to like control my
surroundings if I don't feel in control
of other things very strange but the
other day in church he was talking about
margin and how we have to say no to some
things and even say no to some things
that are good if they're not gonna add
value or if they're gonna add more
stress and negativity into your life
even if the thing that you're saying yes
or no to is it necessarily bad
you should still really try to decipher
whether it's gonna bring good or bad
into your life so I feel like that was
super i opening to me because sometimes
I just say yes to things I'm like well
this is a great thing but in reality it
turns out to just add a lot more stress
and like pressure to my life so I'm
really just trying to find balance right
now I guess is what I'm trying to say
and I would say about a month ago I was
in like a very negative headspace like I
just feel like I was pushing everyone in
my life away because I felt so stressed
and when I do feel super overwhelmed I
just push everyone away like I just I
don't know why I just like feel like I
just need to be by myself cuz I don't
want to like hurt anyone around me like
by lashing out of being stressed so I
just like secluded myself and that's
like the worst thing that you can do
when you're not in the best place
because God puts people in your life to
encourage you and to bring you out of
those places but when I'm in those
places I'm just like everyone don't talk
to me I need to figure this out by
myself which is horrible so that was
about oh sorry so I would say that was
happening about a month ago and then
Marcus and I went on this little trip to
Joshua Tree with some of our friends and
as we were driving I was just like God
doesn't want us to be stressed out all
the time like he doesn't want us to be
like grinding and like on your grind and
like stressed and like he wants you to
live a restful peaceful life it even
says
in the Bible and like God values rest in
us feeling free I think that especially
living in LA that is the exact opposite
of what this entire culture is telling
us all the time like I feel like living
in LA it's just a whole different ball
park or ball game ball park but I just
feel like everything all around me is
constantly telling me to just work
harder be better grow faster make more
do more like do everything that you
possibly can so that you can get more do
more be more and I was just sitting back
while we were in the car and I was just
like that is so not what God wants from
me because if you think about it think
about your intentions why are you
working so hard is it to make more money
is it to impress more people is it for
notoriety for fame or is it to use your
life to glorify God that is the kicker
so that's what I've been asking myself a
lot like what are your intentions with
YouTube like I feel like I kind of lost
sight of like my real goal for a while
and I've always ever since I started my
youtube channel I've always wanted to
use it to glorify God because that's the
most important thing in my life and I
feel like I got to a point where I was
like I just need to make more videos I I
feel bad if I wasn't making enough
videos and I always try to include like
little devotions at the end of my vlogs
and if I forgot to do it I felt so bad
or if I forget to put a bio verse in my
description like I always do I'm just
like so hard on myself and I'm like okay
what is your intention are you just
trying to make people happy are you
trying to just glorify God which is the
real point of life and I actually wrote
this in my phone when we were driving
through the mountains and I like I feel
like God just laid this on my heart so I
thought I should share it with you I
said when we're living in darkness were
unable to see the beauty that's all
around us like driving through a
mountain range during the day versus at
night and I thought about this because
we were driving through the mountains at
night I couldn't see anything and I was
like oh I wonder what's all around us
but then during the day it was like the
most incredible
beautiful thing ever and I'm like this
is what it's like living with God and
without God like God sheds such a light
on everything so you can really see the
beauty that's all around you but if
you're living in shame and guilt and
stress and pressure like your eyes are
just blinded and you can't see all the
great things that God is doing for you
so I hope that maybe that encourages
some of you guys and I hope that you
guys know that I am NOT happy all the
time and sometimes I'm just so stressed
and unhappy that I'm like I can't turn
on the camera because I can't like fake
it because I just can't be inauthentic
to you guys I hope you guys know that
when I am doing videos and I'm happy and
cheerful that is really what I'm feeling
in that moment but sometimes when I'm
not filming or posting on Instagram or
Instagram stories I can feel really down
on myself getting lost in comparison and
pressure and I mean I just think it's
important for us to know that everyone
struggles with that because I've talked
about this a million times but social
media is such a highlight reel of
people's lives and it's not the real
thing
you know what I'm saying like 99% of the
time I have no makeup on my hair in a
bun and pimple cream on I'm not always
like dressed cute with a little bow in
my hair it's frustrating sometimes
because I wish that everyone could know
that but social media I feel like has
become like it's a good thing but it can
also be such a toxic thing I don't
really even know how I got on this topic
but this is usually the topic I end up
on because I just really want you guys
to know that social media is like the
happiest version of people's lives and
to not compare yourself to those
people's lives okay please I pray that
you guys know that because that's like I
really hope that you guys know that let
me just answer some questions because I
don't want to make this video too long
that I can't answer some of your
questions someone asked what is your
best relationship advice ooh
best relationship advice
okay so me and Marcus have been married
a little over a year and I think what I
have learned the most is that
encouragement goes such a long way and
telling someone to do something and
encouraging them to do something is
totally different and I think that
encouragement is so much more powerful
than just being like you need to do this
or can you do this does that make sense
am I making sense I feel like I'm not
I'm not all here today I would say just
encourage your girlfriend or boyfriend
or husband or wife and you would be
amazed at how how life-changing it is
just just encourage them every single
day in every way possible about how
beautiful they are or how handsome they
are how great they are at what they do
and how happy that they're making you it
really makes a difference
I promise someone asks how I was able to
keep my faith while being at one of the
top party schools in the country um yeah
I guess that is true FSU is considered
like one of the biggest party schools in
America which is funny because I never
farted well I just hate partying in
general so it wasn't like a struggle for
me but I know that partying is like a
very big temptation for a lot of people
um I would just say surround yourself
with people that you are like-minded and
find people that like to stay home and
watch movies and eat ice cream and like
have fun nights but not necessarily like
intoxicated crazy night what is this I
don't know the people that you surround
yourself with make the biggest
difference in the world
and if you're surrounding yourself with
people that are always saying come on
come party with us do this drug sorry I
was a little intense but if people are
constantly tempting you to do things
like that you're more likely to fall
into that temptation but if your
surround yourself with positive people
that are encouraging you to be better I
would say that is my best advice what is
your opinion on everything
happens for a reason I would definitely
say everything happens for a reason and
I've really been able to look back in my
life and see this as a definite truth
because even the worst situations God
always can twist and turn and make into
like beautiful situations that you never
thought that you'd be in so I would
definitely agree with that God's plan is
perfect and he knows what he's doing and
I really do think that he writes your
story perfectly even if you do something
that wasn't necessarily in his plan
he'll still make it into something
beautiful
that's just the power of God so I guess
that's it for today's little life update
slash little mini Q&amp;amp;A I really hope that
you guys like this video if you want me
to do it more kind of like heart to
heart videos I guess you could call it
then give it a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for
new videos every single week and I love
you guys so much and I will see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
