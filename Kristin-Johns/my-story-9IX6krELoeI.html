video that I haven't wanted to film for
so long
basically I want to share my story with
you guys or as like Christians would
call it my testimony I feel like I have
shared bits and pieces of my story with
you guys throughout the two years that
I've been here on YouTube just like
talking a little bit about my anxiety a
little bit about long distance a little
bit about my relationship with God just
in like different videos but I just
wanted to kind of compile it all into
one video and share my story with you
guys I guess I'm just gonna start from
the beginning I was born in Baton Rouge
Louisiana I have a mom a dad and a
sister and I have the best family ever
my mom and dad loved each other so much
and I'm just super blessed in that
aspect of my life because I know a lot
of people don't have parents look up to
you for like an example of love and I
feel like I was really blessed with that
so I grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana
until I was in fifth grade and Hurricane
Katrina hit and my dad his job actually
moved to Florida so in sixth grade I
moved to Florida and the summer of fifth
grade I went to a camp called Pine Cove
for the first time with some of my
friends from Louisiana and I think that
was the first like big monumental
spiritual step in my life because I had
grown up in the church I'd heard about
Jesus and I always considered myself to
believe in that and be a Christian but
at that summer camp I decided to
dedicate my life to God and following
God and so that that's kind of like the
first pivotal moment between like me and
my relationship with God but I look back
at that and I think it was probably hard
as a fifth grader to really understand
all of like the ins and outs of being a
Christian and following Jesus so I think
that I my heart was in the right place
but I don't think I fully understood so
then moving on to middle school I feel
like that's when a lot of emotional
battles started for me because I had
always been very outgoing I have so many
great friends surrounding me when I
lived in Louisiana and when I moved to
Florida I didn't have that and I think
that's why I became very introverted and
shy I don't know I don't have the
fondest memories of Nicole but I also
don't think anything like huge happened
in my life throughout middle school my
walk with Jesus was just kind of like
worshiping in Chapel and I didn't really
think anything else of it then in high
school that's when things really started
to get uhm things started to get harder
I guess you could say I I don't want to
say anything specific because like I
don't want to like say anything bad
about people in my life you know because
like there's still people out living in
the world so basically I was in I had
relationships that were not healthy in
my life I also was going through a lot
of stuff because my sophomore year of
high school my sister and her husband
moved to Copenhagen Denmark which was
like the saddest thing of my life
because my sister is my best friend and
that was just really hard and for the
first time in my life a lot of people
and my family passed away which was very
strange because usually when you lose a
family member it's like one person and
then like it'll wait a long time until
the next person passes away but in our
family like in a year and a half period
we lost four of our family members
so um two of my uncles my granddad and
my grandmother all passed away in a very
short period of time I just kind of
suppressed everything I remember just
like never even crying because I was
just like so like just trying to stay
strong for my family trying to just stay
strong for myself and I just kind of
didn't process anything and
when I started developing really really
bad anxiety
I know anxiety kind of manifests itself
in different ways and everybody and the
way it manifested in me was it really
affected my sleep so I remember it was
my sophomore year in high school and one
night I just couldn't fall asleep and it
was the strangest thing and I remember
looking at the clock and it was like 4
o'clock in the morning and I was wide
awake and I started feeling like panic
it was like why the heck am I not
sleeping and it started to making me
really nervous and that was the first
night that I just didn't sleep at all
throughout the whole night and I was
like well that's so weird and then the
next day I was like anxious about
sleeping again
like the next night and so I was
thinking about that all day I was like I
hope I can fall asleep tonight that was
so weird and then from there on it just
got worse and worse and I just started
developing really bad anxiety and it's
so weird even like sakes it sounds just
strange but my anxiety stemmed from like
my nervousness to sleep at night so I
would be thinking about that all day it
would just make me not present in real
life like during day because I would
just be so in my head and also so
exhausting when my mom suggested that I
start going to therapy to kind of like
talk through what was going on with
somebody so I went to a Christian
counselor she was so great I love
therapy and like I highly recommend
therapy for anybody I don't go to
therapy anymore but I would love to
start going again because I just feel
like it's nice to have someone who has
like a third party opinion about your
life that can just like help you through
things but anyway that helped like it
helped me process my emotions and it
kind of helped me understand why I had
developed this anxiety because like I
wasn't talking about anything to people
like I wasn't getting out my sadness
like it was just all brewing inside my
heart I think I did therapy for about
must have been like - it
phears and then i was about to have to
go to college and I got accepted to my
dream College Florida State University
and I was getting so nervous because I
was like I can't go to college like this
like I'm not gonna be able to function
like I'm just too much of like I'm just
too nervous and I hate being away from
home and like how am I just gonna get up
and move away and so one night I was
just like I was having a very horrible
night I remember I was having a panic
attack
I was laying in bed by myself like
hyperventilating and I was just so sad
so I was like that was kind of the
moment where I thought I'm not gonna be
able to go to college like I'm just
gonna have to go do like a college
around here where I live and just live
at home I remember at that time my life
God wasn't really like a priority to me
like it wasn't it was a priority but it
was more like oh yeah I'm a Christian
like I love God I believe in God but it
wasn't like I had a really deep every
single day relationship with God but in
that moment God touched my heart so much
and I remember getting on my knees on
the ground and praying to God I said God
please I give you all my anxiety I give
you my insomnia I give you all these
stresses and problems and I just want
you to have them take them from me and I
just want you to have all of the control
in my life I'm done trying to control
things myself
and give it to you and I just remember
feeling such a huge weight off my
shoulders and I just remember I'm gonna
cry again I just remember so vividly
feeling God tell me it's gonna be okay
I'm taking care of you you're gonna go
to college you're gonna be fine and just
trust me so this is a miracle and I've
shared this on YouTube before and I've
gotten comments saying that's not true
like that's impossible whatever I don't
care if you think it's impossible
because I know
happened and at that moment in that
night God took away my insomnia and he
took away my anxiety and that was really
the first time I had really given my
whole everything to God I went to
college and everything was great and God
really gave me the courage to just
really pursue people and just say will
you be my friend like you seem really
nice
I went on this campus ministry beach
retreat and that's where I met my three
best friends Shannon Abigail and Alexis
that was actually the first time I ever
had friends that were really intentional
about having a really deep relationship
and talking about God and encouraging
each other and they were the first
people to ever ask me like what's your
story like tell us like your walk with
God and like it was just so weird cuz I
was like no one ever asked me that
before and it was just the best thing
ever to have friends that were true
friends I really just felt like I had
renewed my faith so I was just like I
wanted to learn everything I wanted to
talk about God all time and I actually
met Marcus's sister Shelby at a Bible
study I was no joke apart of like five
Bible studies so Shelby was not one of
them and she wanted to introduce me to
Marcus and you guys already know the
story but that's how I met Marcus and so
I guess you could say Marcus was like
the next chapter in my life because I
feel like there is a pattern throughout
my story of God really just like taking
me out of my comfort zone and saying
it's gonna be okay this is what I want
for you and it always turns out for the
best but I'm always like a little bit
nervous a lot about me Marcus and I'm so
happy and Marcus was like no body I had
ever met before he just Marcus just
lived and still lives - taking out of my
comfort zone encouraged me to do things
that I would never do and so we started
dating
and about six months into it he told me
he was moving to Los Angeles and that we
would have to be doing long-distance if
you guys want a whole video about
long-distance I can definitely do that
for you but that was so hard and I was
just really having to rely on God that
whole time because Wow very hard to be
in a relationship long distance for two
and a half years and about a year into
me and Marcus dating he wanted me to
start doing YouTube so I did my first
video with him it was a Q&amp;amp;A video and uh
I did not want to do it I'm throwing
such a bit I was like please I do not
want to be on camera I was so shy ever
since literally ever since middle school
I had stayed shy that entire time and he
was like no Kristen please I really want
everyone to know who you are and then
after that video on his channel it took
me about four months to start my own
channel it took him buying me a camera
teaching me how to edit all this stuff
encouraging me every day to do it and I
finally started doing it now I've been
doing YouTube for almost two years I
think and it's just crazy and I get
really it's like I don't know I just get
really thankful for you guys because I
don't want to cry I think we'll take you
guys because I never thought anyone
would care about what I had to say
because like I don't know you just like
never think oh yeah everyone's gonna
want to listen to my videos like at
least I did not think that and the fact
that I have over 400,000 people that
clicked subscribe because they want to
hear what I have to say is like that's
amazing and I owe a lot to you guys
because sorry I have that cry in my
throat
I gotta swallow it down even if you just
subscribe like an hour ago still like
your support means everything to me and
I just never want to take you guys for
granted because you guys have actually
had like a humongous impact on who I
actually am not just like
in my career anything like that like Who
I am as a person okay so now stop being
cheesy and go on with my story me and
Marcus got engaged in June and then I
was graduating that December and then we
were getting married in February so I
guess that kind of brings me to where
I'm at right now
and just being able to talk to the
camera and tell you guys my story and my
kind of like my testimony with God and
everything like that it just kind of
makes me look back at everything and
just see how amazing God is at creating
your perfect story even out of things
that you think are horrible so I just
really want to encourage you guys if
you're in a place in life where you just
feel like why am I here right now I
don't feel a purpose I don't feel like
this is part of God's plan I would just
say just wait a year or however long God
has planned and you'll be able to look
back at your life and be like wow there
was a purpose for that time in my life
because I can look back at every
horrible and amazing moment and see how
that has shaped exactly where I'm
supposed to be right now
so that is my story up until now maybe
next year I'll have some more things to
add to it
but I really hope that you guys enjoyed
this video and I would love to hear some
of your stories if you want to share
them with me down below and it takes
like a lot for me to sit down and do
these like really vulnerable type of
videos but after I do them I'm always
really happy that I shared more of my
heart with you guys um I love you guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
