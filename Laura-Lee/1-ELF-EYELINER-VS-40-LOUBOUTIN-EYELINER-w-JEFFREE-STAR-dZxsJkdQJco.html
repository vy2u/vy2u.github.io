one thing and if I was Sheriff for my
line okay sorry that was loud your
effort my own head
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
[Laughter]
I thought you was here yeah I'm here all
my nipples out yeah are we doing today
okay
avocado you know why you're here no you
want to see the tea on the island so
Geoffrey has found the Louboutin new
eyeliners yes you have a bunch of
different shades as well but the fun
thing about this video is that we're
going to be comparing them to the elf $1
eyeliner yes now these are for TV
families do you want to be these are $40
now that's Allah that's a little much
for animal let's keep it real but of
course Louboutin is a very prestigious
fashion brand then Dolan to the beauty
world a few years ago everyone talks
about their packaging it's genius let's
be honest yes I mean look at the mascara
baby you can see this mascara still it's
a weight easy literally it's um I was
coming at you girls anymore
here at Yummie me me $40 eyeliner you
guys really acting pretty but it doesn't
like screwing to me like you know I got
my spirits screen now looks like crazy
that's $75 mascara that it is actually
so against today we're going to do a
battle we're going to see what works
better which one is more sickening mmm
one dollar versus forty dollars L salute
on let's do it yes so I was into store
to get one thing and what I had one job
I have one wrong girl and I got medic it
all up I went to get a $1 elf eyeliner
because I know the white packaging elf
products are super super super
affordable and I bought the one that had
shimmer in it but I think we're still
going into the review because we don't
want to get in the car drive to the
store no um our skin we did there's like
I don't think it's cheating yet because
we haven't put on our eyes because she
came over to my house we both had no
eyeliner and
nothing on top so we are going to do a
battle yeah but even though the elephant
said shimmer there's really not tumor
there's no shimmer I don't see any
shimmer in it maybe like one one block
row Lord's work well it's essentially a
matte black liner so what are the claims
on the box okay so on the package here
it says it instantly Bryant eyes with a
shimmering metallic look not true the
Bednar shimmer what a black I don't
think is going to break yeah
darkness closes where's white liner
holding was right in this their hive
relies on smoothly without coming on the
delicate eye area and that's about it it
has applied to the lashline and can be
applied all over eyeshadow I'm not
drinking beer you were literally
drinking a Bud Light not a video okay
that per second here's what I don't get
glides on smoothly without tugging like
I don't pencil totally tug anyways here
it's the human being that's yeah I'm the
tugger Laura them crows to you're gonna
hit you later they are okay sure I and
you're going to be mad don't mean my
grandma come here you want to hear about
the claims on the looking on let me pull
up this so this is a coal ready for it
with that oh that's a weird foreign
accent marker let me let me have
everyone zoom in here I don't know what
that means
I know it's an accent mark for a
different language I think it's French
I'm going to assume because a little bit
tongue is French and if I'm not I'm not
right sorry
these are the velour velvet eye definer
so basically the spy shade yep four
dollars each yep this is supposed to be
a soft pigment rich formula it provides
both color usually reserved for the
ultra dense
Kohl liners of the Pharaohs okay this is
a good it does a little Egyptian rep
okay here's one by Cleopatra days so
basically it can be smudged that's good
to know so it's not waterproof yeah it's
not 24 hour at it if it can be used to
smudge and transform sharp lines into a
softly diffuse a little cute it features
a slender weighted body and accustomed
lengths to provide the most artful
application it is longer than I would
say into a my liner okay yeah okay so
like Donna sauce get brow you dude you a
lot of product yeah I mean Hanna okay
see you take like a whole lot of product
and it is thicker of course this is use
for a short like sharpening industry
on I should sharp six times and one and
of course you can use a sharpener for
this what wait show me my ELF cap feel
free interesting it you can put the cap
on and then you can twist it and it
shocked at your principle for you but
the shavings come out of the top though
right and it's river trash can also it
says all-day wear with no transfer oh
wait that is kind of weird and just
think so it was much proof but yet you
can wear all bag it can be smudged out
and then maybe a dry night at arm anyway
we're going to put that to the test got
it it's also coated in a luxurious matte
black thing we'll talk with a studded
gold cap for an ultra precise look and
feel so what we're going to do here is
we're going to test out one on each eyes
or each going to do elf on one I'm we
look on on the other eye and see how
they wear and you bought me you know hey
I did not buy an elf one but they were
only there were a dollar just great what
you want to do self in chair we I don't
have pink eye anymore those drops really
help actually had sneaked on my entire
life at one time enough little things
you still have it yeah probably drop
eyeliner on the floor so we're going to
get begun and if we don't have it
already
we don't have it at least no don't blow
the dog hair off what color are you
gonna do I don't hey let's look at a
more don't even own color there are
colors Evan look in seven peak in dark
teal cam dark brown ish Oh chartreuse hi
I mean and then we have a purple
metallic
yes so no attention we're yeah I lack
and then we have your black I mean in
trying I don't know which one you want
to try and you the purple on top I'm in
a fun right yeah I think I'm going to
try to the dark teal one yeah don't look
sick okay so we're doing left I left I
with this one right yeah Yes Mother
I know whoa oh it really major really
pretty and pigmented the South one
that's the elf it's not as pigmented
clearly see us add a little more
pressure with that black but I mean for
a dollar that's not a bad liner
not at all honestly it comes the same
though yeah you had to go over a few
more time it looks pretty bomb but I
mean there's
Harmon that right no okay I guess let's
try this woman a sword in waterlines Oh
am i doing it is it
there's no pigment okay I'm not kidding
there didn't what do I am doing
something wrong oh my god that was like
really really light I'm not kidding
the wider is swatch and there's nothing
wrong with mine
maybe need to get warmed up that's what
it is okay like that was like girl don't
play me I know there has to be some
pigment in there well your hand in your
waterline are very two different things
especially doing a harder pressure like
hard hard this is not acceptable for $40
right now okay I'm having a little bit
trouble that was a metallic one oh right
why don't you try this matte brown
that's imma do and I'm actually going to
go ahead and swatch it to just to like
get it rollin I just warning that purple
is not maybe it's just a metallic I mean
it kind of showed up but for $40
okay the Browns way better oh it's
already like covering early okay great
Braille is way better full pigment way
better okay so maybe this shimmer I
should have a little trouble that's
their only shimmer in the collection the
purple and let's agree on her handbag
thank you guys I'm this close to her and
it was like not sticking okay um let me
try the keel all right with your happen
yeah I've never done to you my waterline
I just want to put that out there
whoa what my green eye is super cool
this pigment I'm just noticing than a
flick huh yeah thanks take a lot of back
and forth
hey so I mean I'm gonna be honest with
you I've used creamier eyeliners before
you know where you kind of can just go
to shoot and be done like a once-over
and it kind of like does it whoa the Chi
looks kind of sickening yeah it's really
cool those no can't pop funny you think
it would yeah it really pops okay
definitely not the creamiest eyeliner
I've ever used before but this one was
great that's a good glided on easy yeah
it looks really pretty
I made this your bright eyes look like
everything okay
all right let's have you try that one
you know before you leave I think I
might took my eyes one make sure I get
all my wrinkles I'm just gonna trace
right full color right away Oh sick oh
wow that's why it's not amazing okay
damn that is pitch black honey it's
pitch black and it went on so I kind of
want to try this my job away commend it
out erotic I'm smudging for you not sure
about the smudging it dries really
quickly like it's not really smudging
out oh it didn't much really here watch
it's only been what 20 seconds try it on
yourself didn't smudge your brush is
clean
what no that did not smudge I didn't
want to like it this is like it doesn't
smudge look at that
look I'm gonna hold it it dried
instantly for makeup that's not going to
move and fluff around but it does say on
the website that you can smudge it out
and there's no play time there's no
point time it's actually beautiful but
where you put it is where it's gonna
stay
I mean look right away it's black like
it looks really like no pressure because
he isn't tugging his eye like me no even
on the top it's like really it's going
over the sparkles like melting onto your
eyes yeah most feel like glitters are
like every oh you can see it big-time on
camera it's just like melting right into
your eyelids all right I just dropped a
brush on the ground let's try this one
so it's been about one second since I
applied this it's a lot and honey
in it's not moving I don't know why they
like it says that way come when it
doesn't I mean maybe the shimmery ones
or the other one stupid the black ones
yeah I don't know I'm sorry that's like
a little drinking you guys I have some
eyeshadow on my real lashes and I'm not
wearing falsies today
I think it's time to try out the elf
Islander interesting part here she is
yeah one bottle make you holla it's cute
I mean it's not like pitch black pigment
but first of all there's no shimmer no
shimmer which is fine it's almost like a
like a dark grey like I know it's black
but it's it comes out like a charcoal
that's nice for that's nice for a dollar
it is the other side is like pitch black
oh oh that's nice I feel like both
didn't really excel in the waterline
well the real one did good but I should
look on top it looks a lot better the
till is the best one mm-hmm I mean that
is not that liner mm-hmm should I give
it a whirl you should give the world I
want to try to sharpen it for fun right
now Oh a little hard guy put your back
into it work that wrist hey yeah I'm all
over your nice pants beautiful eyeliner
shadings oh my gosh that shirt in
Wheatly video come on oh that's a good
sharpen our I'm sorry but that make good
shark just bad someone yeah anything
more you can get the real close-up it's
working fine I mean you have to do a
couple strokes that I had to do that
with a lip of puns too
yeah I'm gonna get all my exes yeah it's
the same it's kind of like a charcoal
ease your waterline well let me do
another let me do another layer that's
not yours look better I'm gonna get one
more layer ok there mm-hmm so it does
take some layering which I don't mind I
mean where do I take an actual true
second oh yeah it works I don't know how
you do Eleanor without tugging your eye
that's a skill girl come on anti-aging
style I know right oh yeah it's cute
yeah coming off really nicely oh yeah
the other side it's identical really
alright guys we've applied it to our
eyes and honestly in my opinion I don't
think there were forty dollars in a
sense that they have no playtime fuel
ohms and
even as they water ones are cheaper than
that they have playtime with them yeah
they pretty much look the same as the
elf went however in the water line I
think that the elf one took a little bit
more time a little bit more worth
missing if you will but whether it got
there I mean it worked it was $1 to $40
girls off I ain't girls I'm playing I
know I think 40 is a lot of money now
the packaging to me like they've done
other things that have blown my mind way
more so this didn't like shock me I
think it's cute I love that I was longer
than the average pencil but I don't
think $40 is really worth it I love the
teal color but other brands of that
color I've just never tried that color
really on myself definitely didn't fall
in love with it so the elephant has 0.04
em - that's like that much right and the
Louboutin one has 0.056 okay so it's
like this is 1.6 grams so it has 0.6
more product again all right
so what have we learned today luxury
does not always equal amazing it no it
sure doesn't another that's it as we
review so many things more more I've
been kind of find that to be happening a
lot lately
I didn't - it's like once you get past
the packaging in the name if you get
down to the nitty gritty and the actual
product that's when you find out is it
worth the dollar I agree it is it worth
it I guess yeah I think a lot of
drugstore brands with stepping up their
Pamela and they're coming hard for these
luxury branch at cute packaging with a
formula just flopping yeah all right I'm
on the formula honey I know I agree get
back in that lab the Louboutin was
definitely creamier like right off the
bat the other one you layer twice and it
kind of looks same all right well yeah I
know we tried it I love this brand I
love their fashion but I need them to
step it up honestly alright so basically
we like elf more today
yes I'm diggin elf more I mean if we're
comparing toys yeah I have one
agreed we both did full face elf videos
believe in it and I was shocked how
great they were
yeah I mean they're getting missed but
honestly you can find some killer elf
products
agreed alright guys so that was the
battle the $40 against the $1 island
I think the one all I got went today it
really did you filled my video for my
