channel today's video is going to be
testing out one one mellow liquid
lipsticks I'm really excited about it
now I did a video testing out one dollar
makeup and I kind of discovered when I
would want that me just litter that hot
or only be there whatever the way
anyways I did a video testing one on the
makeup and I found a lot in gyms
so I bought these little lipstick soft
shopman a calm I bought them myself
video is not sponsored and we're going
to find out if these are hot or not good
or bad hit or miss also I found this
makeup look and hopefully will be going
up on my channel so okay so I don't have
on alipio obviously right now because I
didn't want to a spoiled spoil the video
but without further ado be sure inside
you guys didn't expect me to roll it on
in there like that did you um yeah I
think that is seriously all that I got
for you guys my second video done
filming today and I'm hungry is about
5:30 and it is time for you girl to eat
dinner I eat the mall mall special
dinner I like they didn't real early and
then eat another dinner or snack around
9 o'clock just my eating schedule I like
to eat all day what can I say
anyways we're talking about food now
let's move on and get started
go real real talk i swatched some level
and I'm sure you saw a glimpse of that
and the intro of this video and i
swatched them because i couldn't help to
figure it out and what i have concluded
is they're hitting this it's that based
on my swatches now the ones that I wore
in my video where I test up the makeup I
like them a lot so let's go ahead and
jump right in one of my favorite colors
that I like a lot this is called naked
and these are called wonder mat by AOA
studio let me show you the thing that I
like about these and when I remember
about these are the fact that they
weren't any more drawing than majority
oh look a lipsticks out there and
they're literally one dollar not one
dollar some change
one dollar so here is the first color
naked on my lips I love the way it looks
it's really even and it doesn't feel too
heavy we're going to let it dry
and then let me zoom in okay that's skin
peeling off that's my business okay but
really comfortable and really even the
darker colors wrong going on nearly as
even as the neutrals and that's very
common whenever you create a liquid
lipstick the darker shades are always
really hard and take a lot of work to
get eaten or the one dollar price range
I can't imagine that these have too much
of a fancy formula like the bottoms dry
and the things that I love about this is
that it's not cracking and my lips
honestly don't even feel that dry like I
I really like the formula of the
neutrals so I'm going to try on another
neutral and then we'll jump into a dark
one so you guys can see what I'm talking
about okay for the second round I scrub
in my lips so to get the dead skin off
because that's pretty gross you guys
looking at that but we're going to try
on bombshell which is a little bit of a
deeper nude color it's such a pretty
color and now we're not dealing with
large dry skin so it looks better going
to wait it out let it dry just a little
bit and they'll come back and show you
the result but you can firstly see it
applied evenly and it has a little bit
of color behind it so that's really good
okay it's pretty much dry besides that
top little corner there on my lip but I
can tell how it like oh the dry skins
back I can't hold but I drink so much
water and my lips are still playing me
I'll know their issues probably cuz I've
had on six different lip colors today
and we're still going it but can you see
how it's like elastic elasticity to it
and allows your lips to move without
getting the million little cracks in it
that's what I'm loving about these and
too they don't feel that dry and I mean
it's just like there's so many liquid
lipsticks out there they're so pricey
within these are a dollar so it's just
like alright here's the kicker I'm going
to go in with a little bit of a deeper
color this is lit and this is the color
okay let me show you this watch now
oh so crazy and then these I try to wipe
this swatch off it really wouldn't come
off but um I'm going to show you it
she's like not even so I really don't
recommend this one I haven't even tried
on my lip so as it happens
they don't want to add a hundred layers
of this to get it even uh just very
streaky could you make it work is the
end of the world it's absolutely not if
you really want a portable blue lippy I
think you can make this work it would
just take a lot of time I purposefully
am NOT going to recommend it to you guys
but you see what's happening on it so
you can kind of judge it for yourself
because we're all different and all you
know have different approval for things
so it's not the end of the world bad I
mean I've had that just got real patchy
Oh Lord
overall this one just is drying and it's
looking worse than what it did when it
was wet so I I'm going to say no on this
this color is called blogger and it
looks similar but it is quite warmer
than the color bombshell I'm going to
try to out I kind of a mixed review on
the swatch on my hand because it got a
little patchy down here but for the most
part is really beautiful and this is a
pretty bold color so let's see so this
one took a little more time to apply and
it is a tad bit watchy but not nearly as
bachi as the blue color so let's wait
and see how it looks when it dries this
is it on my lips and I approve this one
I mean it took a little more work but
normally the darker colors it takes me a
little bit more getting it perfect and
even and in line on my lips and I think
it looks pretty and it doesn't feel too
drawing it feels like the other formulas
of course so I love this color and I
definitely think you guys could make it
work easily my lips are starting to hurt
really bad alright let's keep the party
moving with trend this is more of like a
Fellman pinky color i swatched it and it
looks pretty this one might be the
creamiest one yet it feels really creamy
and rich whenever I applied it felt kind
of thick and like a whipped formula to
it it applied so even and so beautifully
obviously we're gonna let it dry and see
how it looks so far way down this to dry
I'm going to go ahead and show you guys
fab and I don't recommend back because
it did the exact same thing as the blue
case you guys watched it was just like
so streaky that's a scab so gross
so streaky lay really dark up here I
mean just a mess my lips can't handle
much more but um bad I just the swatches
were identical to the blue so I'm not
going to recommend this one to you guys
anyone else dying for me to get this
piece of glitter off up here I think it
looks really pretty and I approve this
one for sure I think this might be one
of my favorites this is kind of sort of
unique color again this is trend it's
like this pretty pink but with like a
cell many undertone to it I love it I
think it looks great
okay last but certainly not least we
have tees which is this Mabi
lavendar e purpley color whoo just watch
on this one turned out really well
this one just applied so easy I just did
one smart one swatch on this side and it
was like boom on my lips I love that it
just goes to show you the evenness in it
so by the way I just do one this is
drying I'll tell you guys I wore these
for a while and they were completely
normal again a little drying any liquid
lipstick is a little drying nothing
crazy and it didn't crack on my lips
with something huge I look into with
liquid lipsticks so I go ahead and tell
you my overall review on these is the
nude ones is where it's at but even some
of the deeper colors I swatch for you
guys I let you know which ones work the
really dark bold colors I would skip
because I feel like they're just so
patchy it's just so hard to get them
even granted they are only $1 if you
want to try them out it might be worth
it to you so yeah so T's has finally
dried on my lips and I think it looks
incredible this nail this one might be
my favorite just lavender mob and I love
it it's so even on my lips it looks so
pretty and it doesn't feel too drawing
so I'm here I'm all here for it I think
we've really found some gems today I
think we're really going to be saving
some money with these dollar lippies I
will link the little page to the liquid
lipsticks down below they have like so
many colors it's crazy I'm all like six
or seven of them to try them out for you
guys but I'm really impressed I'm really
happy
mom I love you guys thank you so much
for being here and watching and hope to
see you in my next video subscribe to my
channel and I will see you all in my
next video okay the kiss group - I don't
know if I even said that kiss /</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
