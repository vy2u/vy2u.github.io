today's video is going to be testing out
a bunch of really really really
affordable makeup from the wish that
calm place now I've gotten about 10,000
tweets people asking me to check out
this place to see if it's a gimmick or
not because the makeup on there is like
majority of us one dollar there's some
this $2 and $3 but like insanely
affordable so excuse the mirror I didn't
see that sitting there when the wakeup
on that app it's just like it's that an
app actually it might be an app i bought
mine off the computer is just like
insanely affordable and let me just go
ahead and say this about it every place
this is like selling stuff on the app is
from different vendors so i ordered a
ton of stuff a couple things still never
came in and i'm like what the hell but I
ordered literally twenty items plus and
they're from all different I think
Chinese vendors and the stuff came in
all separately in like weeks apart so
like one week I'd get this little Y
shadow when we could get this little
product so it's so scattered about and I
still haven't got things and I've
ordered it so long ago so just know that
before ordering stuff off the website
you're gonna get a million packages if
you put a bunch of stuff in your cart
because that's what I did
anyway so I got enough stuff to film the
video and I'm really excited to film it
and test it out and see if it is even
worth your $1 because they might not be
we're gonna go ahead and sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and then we'll jump right
in and get started and now let's go
ahead and get start
Rusty's in my hair it is what is it
hairspray I had a brain fart not
cooperating with me so if you're
wondering I do have foundation on and I
do have on brows because the products
like literally I ordered this like over
a month ago and it hasn't come in and
I'm wondering if it's just not gonna
come in but I do have a concealer and
that's what I'm gonna jump in the video
with starting so I'm reaching down
trying to grab my mirror where I bought
the shortest mirror I could find but yet
it still stands up you can see it in my
videos cuz I need like a standalone
mirror yeah you can still see it oh well
secrets out I use a mirror start with a
concealer now it looks super cheap okay
this is called space lady Pro Cosmetics
this is what it looks like and I'm not
like wowed by it packaging super cheap
the color looks like it might be okay
so I'm going to mix this around my
finger it feels super super greasy but
the color is nice geez I did pay one
dollar for this and it's covering but it
feels like the weight of the cow sitting
on my under eye like it feels so heavy
and greasy which is not typically what I
go for in a concealer because whenever
you get into like these heavy greasy
concealers a lot of times it can cause
your other makeup to kind of melt down
into the concealer like your mascara
also it causes creasing so I'm already a
little skeptical I'm gonna take my wife
six brush and just do additional
blending and actually it doesn't look
too bad there's definitely some creasing
happen so I'm gonna go ahead and set it
in we'll move on
okay I'm gonna go ahead and let that
bake a little bit at three hundred and
sixty-five degrees because I'm that was
so heavy and crazy I feel like it needs
a really good setting powder to make
things happen I'm actually gonna go
ahead and carve out my brows with this
product because just seems super nice to
do that with maybe
I'm gonna take it 31 brush and just dust
away that powder um the concealer does
not look that great it's a little bit
patch okay not gonna recommend that
concealer to you next I got something
that I think looks pretty pretty pretty
pretty
looks pretty pretty that makes no sense
this is called bronze essentials and
it's like this little bronzer palette
with a highlighter in it as well not
really sure I'm supposed to mix them all
together does she use one it's kind of
hard to get the brush into one of them
so what I'm gonna do is use a smaller
brush I normally like will put some
powder on with this brush but this is a
white 11 and I'm gonna tap into this
shade and then this shade a lot comes
off
I feel like it's I really wanted some of
this to work out if you guys didn't know
I actually test out a lot of $1.00
makeup off shop miss a.com and it does
come in all together which is nice you
don't have to deal with a bunch of
different random packages coming to your
door for a month straight but the
products really worked out for me with
that so if you haven't seen that video
you know check that one out with the
shop meze and this is like really patchy
do you guys see it's very pink too and
I'm even tapping into the darker one and
it's turning super pink oh my gosh like
I'm not living oh my gosh girl no okay
so maybe it's just the color on me but
I'll see lo the formula is a little bit
more difficult to blend and it is
definitely a blendable formula like you
could get it there if you worked at it
for a while but girl no I do not like
this okay let's move on to something a
little more brighter and lighter a
highlighter see what understand so this
is a liquid glow highlighter dropped it
it looks so pretty those three
highlighter it has like this stain on
the front of it but we'll pretend that
it's not there and it's supposed to be a
little liquid highlighter so my makeup
doesn't look that bad it's just I just
don't love it and probably can't really
see myself be using it so just around
the edge of it there is Krusty's where
it's dried out a little bit
okay the highlighter is so pretty what
in the world okay we have a winner oh my
gosh I think we have a winner do we have
a winner I think we have a winning
product the highlighter is pretty oh my
gosh thank goodness I thought this video
the whole thing was about to be a flop
so I feel really dewy and I like the
highlighter like I think it's very dewy
and pretty oh my gosh we have a good
product hallelujah I was so scared we're
about to have a flop on our hands yeah
so next is eyeshadow and I found these
little pallets on the site and it comes
with a Satan sponge applicator here's
one of them
and this one's Oh - and this one's oh
one you like pick them by the number so
here is the other palette okay then I
ordered this little mini palette and she
had a hard trip over so we only lost
like to one and a half shades so
probably use a couple out of this
palette just to see what's going on hey
I'm gonna take it in five seven three
brush I'm going to happen to this little
shade right here you guys know I like to
put down the cream or bone shade just to
soften up the primer and I did use that
concealer as it by primer
next up I'll grab this brown shade it's
kind of hard to get your brush and then
little tiny pan but it's definitely
doable so I'm gonna win this right in
the crease as a transition shade using
the exact same brush and as of right now
it seems to be blending okay
not a ton of pigment but it pretty
decent I'll give it to it so I'm gonna
grab a little bit of a warmer brown with
this same brush and just pop that right
into the crease as well I'm just gonna
blend that right in warming up the look
you guys see that glow I'm gonna go in
with this brown shade a little right
there right there and this is our 39
brush so I just want to pack this on in
the outer corner this plug does not have
that much pigment in it so I'm having to
kind of layer it up
I really like this bronze brown shade in
this palette so I'm gonna try it out
until my I lead first I really want to
try to carve out the crease or like put
some concealer down so it sticks pretty
well
now I am using the concealer that is the
little $1.00 compact so I hope this
really doesn't screw anything up it is
kind of a heavier concealer I'm actually
gonna use this sponge applicator I know
you guys are shook right now like girl
why are you dumb when I'm gonna use it
because I want to pack on this color
actually I hate this color okay great
I'm gonna try and go for this more
champagne color I was gonna try to do
like a smoky dark brown eye look but
like this color is garbage this is brown
shade to me it just did not turn out
it's pretty on my eyelid darn it the
concealer seems to so far be making a
pretty good eye shadow primer I'm gonna
take some of this darker brown and I'm
gonna try it to define our crease a
little bit more with that shade this
pencil brush is at a 36 and it's one of
my favorite little detail brushes to
work with
all right next up I bought this eye
liner and the packaging to it oh my gosh
is so cool it actually is like eye
shadow eyeliner quad thing together so
the top point is an eye shadow how cool
is that looks like a red rocket it's an
eyeliner but that brush looks kind of
brutal oh girl let me show you let me
let me just show you let me show you
this eye shadow girl wait wait let me
try this out my brow bone really
interesting product but like the eye
shadow is kind of floppy so okay I'm
gonna try the eyeliner I'm really scared
that we're gonna mess at the looks I
think that eyes look pretty good for the
affordable it's this liner brush just
seems like it's gonna kick my ass so I'm
gonna try anyways and hopefully it
doesn't win there's a fly in this room
trying to distract me trying to mess up
my eyeliner so right off the liner feels
kind of thin and watery I'm having to
layer it up because the eye shadow is
showing through the liner this is
definitely gonna be one of those
eyeliners that dry shiny and that drives
me crazy
okay I think I did it
honestly the liner is not that bad if
you layer it up I just personally don't
like eyeliners they dry shiny and that's
a personal preference so now you know
and the eye shadow on top is like floppy
but the liner it's not so bad okay I
went ahead and added some lashes so next
up is for lippy actually I'm gonna add
some eye shine on my lower lash line
yeah so I'm gonna grab some of that
warmer brown shade and try to smoke out
the lower lash line and now I'm tapping
into the darker brown shade all right
for the lip ease it says this is a lip
gloss but it's called active lips color
number fifteen but when I bought it
online it was like a liquid lipstick so
this is what the packaging looks like
actually a really cute little packaging
um and if you can see it looks like
definitely a liquid lipstick not a gloss
it's actually super pigmented and it's
really pretty alright guys that is it
for this video Wow the liquid lipstick
turn oh now I'm in focus
great the liquid lipstick it says lip
gloss this is a liquid lipstick and it's
really comfortable and really pigmented
so I'm excited about that highlighters
amazing the eyeshadows are spotty like
it took you finished it took like so
many tries to get the cut and build up
on color to get it to like really show
up shimmers were nice eyeliners too
shiny for me personally but it worked
and the bronzer was floppy the
concealers okay I don't see myself using
every day it's not the end of the world
bad the highlight was my favorite the
highlight in the lip was my favorite now
you know and I think that's about it so
yeah some hit misses you know with some
good stuff too so that's really awesome
