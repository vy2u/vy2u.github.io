in public and completely forgot to put
on deodorant
I think it's happened to most of us so
the thing is sweat it's not what
actually stink is the bacteria
underneath your arms so if you have a
little bit of hand sanitizer you can rub
that or spritz it underneath your arms
to kill the bacteria which will kill the
bad smell and you'll be good to go this
is not recommended for everyday use but
it is good for every now and then when
you forget that do for yo Beto so a
beauty hack fell is a lot of people like
to use the trick to put deodorant on
their t-zone to keep it from getting
oily guess what Deirdre it has lots of
chemicals that are only meant for the
underarm area and not for your face so
do not put deodorant on your face people
that's right girl wipe it off get it off
your face the next beauty hack is for
smelly feet if you have smelly feet is
the same concept it's not necessarily
the sweat that's making it your feet
stink
it is the bacteria so give them a good
scrub get all the dead skin off of your
feet that way you have nice polish new
skin on your feet and before you put
your shoes on give them a spritz with
the pan sanitizer to kill that bacteria
also flip your socks inside out when you
wash them
a total Beauty hack fell believe it or
not is putting vaseline or petroleum
jelly on your lashes to make them grow
and healthy it can actually cause Melia
or cysts along your lash line which will
look like little white bumps because
it's way too heavy of a moisturizer try
castor oil a really cool beauty hack is
if your hair is brittle or
over-processed check all of your beauty
products especially when purchasing them
for the ingredient alcohol alcohol is in
a lot of beauty hair products which is
drying your hair out even worse so just
go through everything and check it
before you buy it make sure it doesn't
have a lot of products do have it in it
but actually a lot of products don't
so there are my news all these products
have alcohol and these are my don'ts
a lot of people are using sea salt as
their DIY facial scrub well guess what
sea salt does not dissolve as quickly as
a exfoliant so it can actually cut or
scratch your skin and damage it so just
stick to using a regular facial
exfoliant the beads and these are meant
to dissolve really quick that way
doesn't damage your skin so I asked you
guys on Twitter for some beauty hacks
and rain ELISA gave us this one a lot of
issues mattifying foundations for the
summertime when our skin is oily but in
the winter time our skin is dry so
instead of buying a new foundation you
can just mix a facial oil make sure it's
a facial with your foundation to give a
natural finish or that more glowy finish
with your dry skin and you will have to
buy a whole new foundation voila thanks
Alysa
beauty hacks pill scrubbing your nails
with lemon juice
so actually lemons are very acidic as we
know and instead of polishing your nails
they can leave them very dry and brittle
you should never put anything this
acidic on your nails or your skin
because I mean they're drying very
drying for nil Beauty hack number five
is from Maisie thank you so much Maisie
so what you like to do is whenever
you're out of your liner and just take a
little bit of mascara on a liner brush
and line your lids and this worked
really really well and it lasted for a
long time and ended up with a mattifying
gel liner for my mascara tube look at
that that's so cool thanks Maisie for
our Beauty hack Phil I think we've all
done this at Hammer - spritzing our face
with a little hairspray to set our
makeup but again hairspray is full of
chemicals that can clog your pores and
cause breakouts don't do it just stick
with a setting spray they make good
drugstore ones or this one's a really
good one all kinds of facial setting
sprays that work just as well it's not
better and won't clog your pores any
hack number six comes from Karen and I
love this one as well just hitting up
your lash curler with a blow-dryer or
I'm just using a little heat from a
candle be sure to test it on your wrist
to make sure it's not too hot and not
gonna burn your lids and then curl your
lashes and yes your lashes will stand
straight up all day long
a beauty hack fell comes from Beauty
babes and that is taping off your skin
to do the winged liner straight but
guess what tape has chemicals in it and
the adhesive is too strong for your skin
especially if you're gonna do this every
day it's not good for your skin it off
pulling it off it's really bad for your
skin too so just stick with using a
credit card or anything with a flat edge
to do that with our neck pack comes from
Dez and it's twisting your hairs and all
the little split ends will shoot up and
you can use scissors to trim off your
split ends I'm just going to use my
electric little trimmer here because
it's so much easier and I found that
this process works best whenever you do
smaller pieces of hair look at all this
split in shooting up and you can just
trim them right off without losing
inches of your hair a verb UT hack fill
is using Pam cooking spray do you like
my simulation I didn't have any Pam just
spritz your nails with to make them dry
fast so this actually only dries the top
coat really fast and underneath your
nails is really wet yeah it doesn't work
because your nails are actually still
wet on the underneath part and they will
end up messed up
Beauty hack number eight dealing with
Ronnie eyeliner yeah we've all been
there
well what I like to do is any shade
eyeliner I'm going to using which is
typically black I lined the waterline
and then what I like to do is take the
shade eyeshadow that the eyeliner is so
black eyeliner black eye shadow I'm
gonna take this little bitty brush and
press the eyeshadow onto the eyeliner
and it will literally keep your eyeliner
and your waterline all day so if you use
purple eyeliner you would just use a
purple eyeshadow bada-bing bada-boom
mutti hag fill again
Dill's with lemons I know a good beauty
hack out there is to scrub your pits
with lemons to whiten them but actually
your underarms skin is extremely
sensitive just like your face and these
are way too acidic for your underarms
and they can really irritate and damage
the skin leaving little bumps which is
never pretty
no girl don't do it and a beauty hack
for the dirty lash curler I know we all
have keiki lash curlers so I heat it up
and then take a cotton ball with a
little bit of makeup remover and it
literally buffs off like you barely have
to touch it I don't even know that you
have to use the makeup remover it just
like falls off beauty hacks Pelle comes
from Mari so coconut oil is so good for
so many different uses but guess what it
is an oil and it will clog your drain so
if you put a line in your hair and you
run it down your bathtub you could
possibly clog your drain so be careful
using coconut oil
Beauty hack number ten comes from moneka
rose if you have dry cracked crusty lips
like I always do you can gently scrub
them with a dampened toothbrush just to
exfoliate them I then recommend putting
on a little bit of vaseline or lip gloss
to smoothen them and then your lipstick
will apply it so friggin smooth oh look
at that
perfect smooth lip so a beauty hack fell
believe it or not is using cooking oils
such as olive oil to moisturize your
skin if you're dealing with any clogged
pores or any bumps because it can
actually clog those pores way worse this
is only for mature skin if you're not
dealing with any acne whatsoever
stick to your usual moisturizers peeps
and bone work Beauty hack number eleven
comes from Sylvia she has dark circles
under our eyes and cold water and Callum
teabags on the eyes helps to relieve
this also if you elevate your head it
will help take down the puffiness
because you're getting more circulation
elevate your head Laura Laura pick up
your head thank you I hope you guys
