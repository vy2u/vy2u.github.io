things of people saying hey they got
really affordable but do fish makeup on
there and we saw like I said douche
douche makeup photo makeup on there and
we need to know that make its good
because it's so cheap on the app and so
I was like what's his shop so we
downloaded that what did the makeup and
I will say it came in really quickly and
it came in with really nice bubble wrap
packaging so there's that I want what
are quite a few pallets ordered
highlighters and liquid lipstick and
we're basically gonna compare it and see
what the tea is and see what does a dupe
for I'm excited to be testing it out
thank you guys for the video
recommendation yeah and if you guys want
me to review we'll see how this goes
nobody you know I can review more stuff
off the app I don't know anyway so
without further ado we're gonna sing the
SUBSCRIBE songs Arling and then we're
gonna jump right into the video
alright and now we can go ahead and jump
right into ok t/o
shall we begun yourself oh also I didn't

that's where the winner will be
announced in the description box on this
video so here's my hush box I thought
let me look his girl then my whole order
come in here's the ABS says hush know a
fish thing seems sponsored but I swear
you guys just request it so I bought it
how much run about $12 each some are 10
bucks but that's the price like for
instance this retro love palette I
bought with $10 and they sell like NYX
and I'm just trying to tell you guys a
little T about that um and it said I got
a free gift in here like with my order
but the free gift never came which is
totally fine but just to let you guys
know you suppose we get to forgive I
didn't get my free gift I'm not upset
about it
that's just tea first let me just show
you guys yeah I paid 12 bucks for some
of the palette 12 in 10 bucks so right
off I'm gonna start showing you the
palettes I know I've jabbered a lot and
we need to keep the party moving I got
this retro love palette right when I
open it it's immediately it's literally
subculture so culture looks like a crime
scene but if you can see it's literally
what I would almost call a knockoff I
haven't tested the quality i swatched
one of these colors to see if there was
an explosion of color like subculture
and there was not so i will say that the
actual packaging it fills luxurious and
heavy which i'm so shook about normally
with these like knockoff palette
situations it feels so cheep and rinky
but there's a mirror in there and it
feels like a heavy nice actually about
for ten dollars that's what I got is $10
as well or $12 after night this one is
bad habit now when I open this first of
all here's the packaging again it feels
really nice and
like it's like a lux I shoulda palette
has the magnetic closure has the mirror
all those things cost money
what palette do you see here you see the
first Buddha Beauty rose gold palette
because that's what I see colors are
mixed around a little bit but it's the
same palette so if you get what I'm
saying they're kind of knockoff II
because they are the same palette last
one or actually I bought two more
Atheneum super luxe graphics on the
palettes pretty this is the desert dust
palette from Total Beauty I don't have
that palette on hand and compare because
someone's borrow in it and I got to get
it back
well it's three purchased six I like it
it says that these are cool cruelty-free
by the way I don't know if the quality's
the same but we're gonna see in the last
palette eyeballed inferno no yeah that's
what's called it's called bad habit by
the way it looks pretty cool graphics on
it super heavy and nice feeling with a
mirror in there it looks really
beautiful
ten dollars yeah the price is great but
then date wasting ten dollars is wasting
ten dollars if the quality is not good
and you won't find yourself using the
palette so I'm gonna do some swatches
and I'm gonna do an eye look I'm also
gonna test out liquid lipsticks and the
highlighter so let me go ahead and show
you the packaging of the highlighters
just says highlight this feels a little
bit more cheap and lightweight it's
already missing some coloring on the
corner right there it looks cheap the
first thing is subculture just watching
the shimmers and I will say this there's
three shimmers in this palette like
Sopot Oh Lord look at the pigmentation
okay I'm a little shook II well shook
ewokese players are not identical but
they are extremely similar and it has
just as much pigment especially in the
shimmers like I said the shimmers in the
up subculture palette are really nice
so now let's watch a couple of the matte
shades and see the difference may be
onto something great here party people
oh my goodness guys it's almost
identical um it appears that this
palette just isn't as quite as messy as
far as like the fallout there is a
little bit of fallout with this palette
like I would say a little more fallout
than in an average eyeshadow palette but
nothing like some
sure so I definitely think this is
usable I'm going to show you guys an
example fallout that's me dusting my
brush around in this color free love
right sorry is that rose gold palette I
will say that these are a little bit
more like a shimmer eyeshadow and these
are almost like a little more flaky like
a loose pigment pack into the shadow so
they have a bit of a different texture
but the outcome is almost identical as
far as the swatches as far as the matte
i swatch them in the matte colors
they're a little more difficult to
create such as pinks in red they're
identical and I swatch one of the
duochrome aired essence shimmers they're
pretty much identical quality is there
guys the thing that sucks about this I
will say it's like it is a ripoff I mean
it's the same palette but I mean there
there is that you know do you want to
buy the original who the real thing the
hood obd or the rip-off palette
yeah $10 you get $65 $55 difference
there I don't know that's you know you
guys it's personal preference I put it
out there for you guys well you know I
do this for my career as far as buying
these palettes and reviewing what you
guys want me to review I personally like
the real thing because I feel like
that's who does original idea and it you
know that's her whole palette she
created so I like to support who does
it's up to you guys not everybody feels
the same way I feel just put the
information out there so now I am going
to do an eye look with these and then I
will swatch these palettes as well and
I'm also going to use the highlighter so
you guys hang out towards the end of the
video you will see more swatches and
more thoughts on all this stuff
including the liquid lipsticks so let's
jump into a I makeup look right now I'm
gonna do a look kind of incorporating
both palettes so we can really see on
both palettes play on the eye I'm gonna
start off with rebel which is the yellow
shade this is a a 27 brush by the way
you shook to be honest with you like you
don't normally deal with ripoff do it's
like extremely similar like what are you
guys thoughts I know everybody has a
different opinion on that and that's
okay cuz we're all different people but
I love to hear you sound off in the
comments section like what do you think
about this it's this completely wrong
like is this a big no-no or it's like
hey tryin to save a dollar trying to
make a dollar like what are your
thoughts and do is take this e 43 brush
and just blend this all over
gonna try to do something similar Simmi
colorful it might turn out real colorful
I don't know
the yellow is blending out so nicely
without overpowering I'm gonna take Lord
from this palette which is the orange so
much comes off guys tap that brush honey
by the way this is our 39 it's one of my
favorite blenders just gonna pop that in
the crease that is so pigmented sitting
on a pink I'm gonna take some a flirt
and I'm using the exact exact same brush
I'm just gonna pop it right into the
crease just trying to build up some
colorful colors and actually try to play
with these and like see how they perform
so far honestly I love it they're
performing really really nicely which is
like shocking honestly I was very
skeptical and whenever I start were in
the stuff on the app I was literally
like okay this is gonna be pipo but
we'll try it out you know and see what
happens maybe there's a chance it won't
be and we are falling into that chance
that it's not I'm going to take a little
bit of less lust has a lot of Fallout
super pigmented from what I could tell
with this watch
I'm going to tap into justice which is
the purple loads of pigment and press it
onto the eyelid hmm did not show up as
well so this is my floppy color that I'm
running into even when I swatch it it
just turns to poop so interesting we
have a flippity-flop and that came out
of the one that looks like the desert
dust palette I'm gonna try out some
gleam
which is wildly pigmented and really
beautiful
geez Louise that's a pretty color take a
more fee and 139 which has like that
tapered in right there having a little
bit of rock n'roll to the outer corner
yeah that has a lot of pigment so nice
it's weird how these are hitting this
like some are amazing and some just
blend out to nothing which is a little
bizarre to me
it takes some a psychedelic and add that
to my brow bone into the inner corner
this is it a 36 little pencil brush pink
reflective in it which is really cool
I'm going to take this Pat McGrath line
or pin and just line my eyes
on a 210 brush I'm gonna mix the pink
and red and blue net on the lower lash
line I'm gonna take the pink then did
honey blend it in the lower lash line
I'm gonna take the red and just blend it
on top of it keep it a little bit closer
to the lashes all right next up we have
the highlighter palette I went ahead and
smarsh these I already complained about
the packaging and the swatches are so
sad oh I'm gonna start with the middle
pink one but this might be the palette
this might be a palette to skip there's
just a little bit of shimmer I love it I
don't love it did buy a six pack of
liquid lipsticks these are for the six
I'm a Miss sighs oops besides the two on
the end they they all look the same
I literally smell a bathroom cleaner
feel really sandy and grainy on the lips
but overall the color looks really
pretty you know I'm pretty even alright
guys that is it for this video really
quick I'm gonna show you swatches of the
inferno palette which swatch just as
well rideable pigment and it's really
pretty matte palette the mattes
even swatch super nice from swatches of
it and they look like seriously a
high-end eyeshadow palette this palette
was $10 so I'm gonna use this in the
future I'm really excited about it
there's another look at that palette
really pretty so some of the colors of
the palettes we're hitting this as you
guys saw some of the darker colors just
would not blend they blend into nothing
and then some have like incredible
pigment this liquid lipstick feels
really really comfortable on my lips not
too dry and it looks really beautiful in
that and on even so actually like the
liquid lipstick I just thought was
bizarre that they come in six-packs and
all the colors are pretty much the same
little weird but hey you get a lot of
liquid lipsticks the highlighter palette
I bought I highly suggest you skip on
and then I mean the eyeshadows are so
affordable again it's up to you because
they are kind of ripoff II if you think
it's worth the purchase anyways that is
it for this video super interesting
little situation there
love you guys thank you so much for
watching and I hope to see you all my
new video lord have mercy my next video
