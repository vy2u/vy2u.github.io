video thanks for joining me and we're
going to start off with Beauty hack
numero uno first hack is the lashes if
you promise with your lashes growing out
straight we're just going to get
hairdryer our lash curler and we're just
going to heat up the lash curler just a
little bit with the air coming from the
blow-dryer obviously and this is held up
by the blowing go you don't need this to
create this little hack
but we're warming it up and it's really
important to test this with your fingers
and then the skin on your wrists make
sure it's not too hot it's not going to
burn your eyelid but once it's just a
little bit warm
you can then it crunch down on those
lashes hold for 9 to 10 seconds and the
results are oh my gosh they're so
amazing please look at the difference so
we're just going to do the other eye now
just so you can see another close-up
just with it kind of warm and holding it
for 10 seconds and bam our lashes are
standing straight up so amazing beauty
hack number 2 dry shampoo and flats do
have a lot in common believe it or not
our feet get sweaty and my feet get a
little bit smelly when I don't wear
socks and I wear these plasticky cheap
flat it's just a part of life girls and
we know what happens so a cool hack to
avoid this is spraying your feet with
dry shampoo not only does it keep your
feet dry from being sweaty it also makes
them smell good and they sell
travel-size dry shampoos to carry with
you in your handbag to touch up your
little tips ease if you need to such a
great PD hack
Beauty hack normal three lotion and
foundation have you ever gone to Sephora
picked out a new high-end foundation and
then you come home trying on your skin
and it is way too dark Oh train wreck so
what do you do all you have to do is
grab your favorite lightweight
moisturizer and add just a little bit to
your foundation to lighten it up this
also kind of makes it like a BB cream
but I love this trick and it makes all
your foundations so much more wearable
and you can customize the colors of your
foundation depending on how much lotion
you add and as you can see here it is a
perfect match to my skin
another amazing Beauty hack Beauty hack
number four Vaseline and perfume also
have a lot in common if your perfume
seems to wear off easily simply apply a
little bit of Vaseline to the areas that
you're going to apply your perfume and
that stuff will last on you all night
long and you will be smelling so weak I
love my Juicy Couture and I love that
beauty hack moving on a beauty hack
number five so many of you have asked me
how do you keep your liner in your
waterline because it does tend to wear
off really easily a really quick hack to
do is apply your liner whatever color
you're going to use I'm using black so
I'm going to go in with a black eye
shadow to match the eyeliner and very
gently just touch onto the black liner
and this will lock that onto your
waterline all day and all night is such
a quick easy trick Beauty hack numeral
six
moving right along feet you guys have
shoes ever left blisters on your feet of
course they have so all you have to do
here is get a pair of big fuzzy socks
heat them up any way you would like I
personally like just using my hair dryer
and wearing them in around the house now
this isn't a very attractive look but
this stretches out the shoes and
prevents blisters Beauty hack numeral
seven I like saying numeral if you can't
tell this has to do with our nail polish
and as ladies majorities have had
experience the dried out nail polish and
this is one of my favorite colors and I
want a little bit more use out of it so
I'm just going to splash a little bit of
nail polish remover with in it give it
really good shake and it's like new
again and I can finish off my bottle of
Polish beauty hack number eight this is
my favorite one by the white guy so
adding your favorite oils or your
favorite lotion to your legs go ahead
and smooth that in get your legs super
moisturize and this isn't the best hack
ever take a shimmery blush that it's a
little bit of pink and shimmer in it and
run it right down your shin bone and
your legs will look like they're eight
feet long super skinny and you'll just
look like you have supermodel legs
such a great chick and I wear that out
every weekend Beauty hack number nine
must garras the struggle of drying out
mascara is unreal you guys crusty crusty
so a quick little trick is to get a
glass of pretty hot water and to pop
your tube of mascara in there for about
a minute and the warm water will warm up
the mascara and make it so much more
easy to use much more useful you can get
the last bit of your mascara out and it
glides on so much better
and lastly Beauty hack Newell whoa
bobby pins people how many live with a
daily struggle of bobby pins not staying
in place I know I do so what we're gonna
do here today is we're gonna get a paper
towel spread the bobby pins we want to
use out on it give them a quick little
spritz of our favorite heavy duty hold
hairspray and once they are kind of
dampen but not soaked with the hairspray
I'll pop them back into my hair and it
is so amazing the difference in the
bobby pins these are the exact bobby
pins I had before and my hair isn't
budging tada thank you guys so much for
