a pair of suede shoes that you put them
on the world and there is a cluster of
dirt suede shoes why you guys do mean
like that well I do have a solution just
gently buff away the dirt with a nail
file really gently and then I'm just
gonna dust away the excess from the nail
file that left a little dust on there
and then the shoe is as good as new
voila hack number two for hack number
two I'm going to show you how to fix
that unraveling button that annoys us
all yeah girl I know so what you're
gonna do is kind of swivel the fabric or
the little string that's hanging into a
knot you're gonna take a little bit of
clear nail polish and you're gonna swipe
it all over it just to stick it down and
hold it in place this will last you for
a couple of wears hack number three all
right for a hack number three ever have
those leather shoes to get dull and
dusty they do that so easy why is that
so annoying anyways there's an easy fix
is to grab a moisturizer I'm going to be
using my facial moisturizer I'm just
going to apply a small amount into the
shoe leather massaging it in this is
gonna be the moisture into the shoe just
like onto your face or skin and it's
gonna bring it back to life and make the
shoe look nice and new again
TAC number four if you are a girl you
have probably dealt with this at some
point in your boob life the busted bra
the metal shooting out of your bra can
be the most uncomfortable situation but
yet you don't want to throw out you're a
million dollar Victoria's Secret bra I
know it's annoying well I'll have a
solution
I like the clapping eights I get them at
the Dollar Tree so you'll just take a
band-aid and you will add a little
cushion side to the band-aid right over
the metal sticking it down and it's
gonna keep that little metal piece in
and it's also gonna make it much more
comfortable for you to wear you'll
probably have to reapply after washing
but hey girl hey good as new
well almost for hack number five we've
all gotten lipstick on a shirt on a
pillow on a blanket on something a quick
trick is to add a little bit of
hairspray to it actually I had a lot of
hairspray to it and then I throw it in
the wash and it helps to seal in the
holes from the lipstick that way it
won't bleed into the fabric and then it
will pop right out as soon as it's done
washing hack number six we have all had
a zipper that keeps getting stuck which
is so annoying so take a little bit of
petroleum jelly or Vaseline same
difference and we are gonna coat the
zipper with it the area that is sticking
and boom is lips right up it's a genius
pack I know
and there's cap Hank number seven
alright so got a scuff on your shoe so
annoying a really cool trick that I just
tested out wanted this video and it
worked so well I was in shock I took a
little bit of Vaseline I put it on a
cotton swab and I buffed away the little
scuff mark it was amazing this was my
favorite hack and I like tried it on the
video and it worked like a charm oh I'm
so impressed
pack them hope you like my singing okay
so blue jeans a lot of us don't wash
them every time we wear them because it
tears them off and it gets with shape
out of all make some fade but they can
start to smell so a way to not wash your
jeans in between each wear but keep
those smelling fresh it's put them in a
big ziploc bag and pop them into the
freezer what this is doing is killing
any bacteria on the jeans that is making
them smell bad and then once they've
been in there for about eight hours or
so you can pull them back out and put
them on and I promise you they will
smell fresh hack number nine we're
getting close to the end all right so
the Razorback shirt in the annoying bra
shop I have a solution on jesu take a
paper clip and you hook both the bass
drops in the paper clip in the back and
then while ah they are covered and not
only that it's like an instant boob job
it lifts your bra so much in the front
Hey
yeah pack number 10 alright last tag
we've all gotten makeup on our shirt at
some point in our life if you do wear
makeup so quick solution is to add a
little bit of shaving cream to that area
I do prefer that you take the shirt off
first but you know we're just gonna roll
with it and I'm gonna massage it into
the stain and then you're gonna pop it
into the wash and the stain will come
right out it is a trick like magic that
is it for this video please give it a
thumbs up and subscribe before you leave
I love you guys in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
