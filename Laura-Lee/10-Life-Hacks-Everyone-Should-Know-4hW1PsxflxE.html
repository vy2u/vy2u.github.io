video is going to be a life hacks video
and these are the most random but
efficient life hacks that everybody can
use to just simply make their life
easier
also I am giving away an iPad in a
crapload of makeup on my giveaway video
which ends really soon put it in the
description bar be sure to enter that
giveaway because it's super awesome if
you enjoyed this video and be sure to
subscribe before you leave our first
life hack involves Nils not the ones on
your hands like to once your hang stuff
with so you can sometimes slip and hit
your finger whenever trying to start an
L so all you have to do is put the note
between a clothespin and get it started
on the wall where you want to make the
hole and then release it and then hammer
tool your heart's content and that is
our first life hack easy peasy lemon
squeezy our next life hack and Bob's
boots and this is something that I have
been doing for a super long time so as
you know boots launched over which gives
a really annoying and takes up more
space in your closet so all you have to
do is take a flick a big roll that comes
out of Christmas paper or wrapping paper
cut it in half stick it down into the
boots and they will stand straight up
and keep their structure next life hack
involves tape so this is like the
smallest thing but yet the most annoying
thing whenever you can't find where the
tape stops and starts all murdered all
you do is take something small like a
paper clip and stick it to the edge when
you're finished with the tape and there
you have it you will always be able to
start your tapes
super easy like hack number luggage so
this one is super easy how many times
you've been to the airport and you think
you got your luggage but you don't
because everybody's luggage looks the
same nowadays although this one has
orange and the next one is red you get
where I'm going with this
so all you have to do is tie colorful
string or a ribbon or a bow on your
luggage and you'll be able to identify
it so much more easy yay
hack number five and five iPhone so if
you're out in a public place and you're
just trying to chill watch the video on
your phone how many times does this
happen to us all you have to do is take
your sunglasses flip them upside down
and you have a phone stand so you don't
have to hold your phone the whole time I
love this hack and it is super duper
useful yay for free iPhone stand hack
number six trashcans okay the bottom of
trash cans could get really gross
because things leak through the trash
bags and it gets gooky is google word
all you have to do is apply some tissue
paper or newspaper to the bottom of your
trashcan and it will absorb some of the
liquids and keep your trashcan from
being gross and smelly well I don't know
about smelly that's on you hack them
seven strong this one's super random but
carbonated drinks you try to put a straw
in them and they bounce right back up
all you have to do is flip the tab over
and stick the straw through the hole and
it will lock your straw in place and you
will drink your soda or whatever it is
you're drinking happily ever after
thank you you're welcome pack them a
sokar's if you live in an area where
gets super hot outside it hurts to touch
your little shifter gear thing so all
you have to do is you had to put a
huggie on top of it and is super easy
and it won't fry your hand off notice
there are no keys I'm pretending to
crank the car yeah
okay moving on hack number nine business
cards okay when networking a super
important tip you get so many business
cards and chances are you're gonna lose
like half of them well at least I will
so I always take a picture of them with
my phone and then toss them into my
purse and that way I have the business
card no matter where I'm at it won't get
lost hack number ten involves clothes
how many of us have too many clothes and
not enough closet space that's me so all
you have to do is take a little tab off
a soda can and you can apply it through
a hanger and then loop the other hanger
through and you get double the closet
space if this one is like the best hack
ever
now we can go buy more food thank you so
much for watching these were all of my
hacks subscribe before you leave and
I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
