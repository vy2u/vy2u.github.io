to enter so without further ado I think
it's time that we sing our little song
and if you're new to this channel well
girl that songs about to be stuck in
your head all day and we'll go ahead and
jump right in and get started
okay okay sorry so we're going to be
getting ready quick today first I'm
going to go in with one of my favorite
drugstore primers this one is by elf
this one is a little bit thicker texture
to it oh my god just like put it
everywhere and it kind of feels like a
moisturizer I have a little bit of dry
skin so this is helpful if you have oily
skin you might want to find a more pore
minimizing all control primer I don't so
I'm going to use a moisturizing one and
really this will just help your makeup
look prettier longer during the day for
foundation I'm going to be using the pro
glow by L'Oreal I will have shade 2:05
I'm going to be putting on today
foundation is really great and it is me
and cover so it's not too heavy and it's
really easy and quick to blend out on
your skin I think it will where's nicely
if you have a very oily skin you might
want to try the pro matte one this one
is pro glow so it gives a little bit of
luminosity and looks a bit more natural
on the skin and it wears really
beautifully so easy to apply to because
it's not too thick and you don't have to
spend too much time blending this one
out very liquidy and as you can see
bada-bing bada-boom we're blending it
out and babydoll you already know this
girl uses a white picture morphe that
has been sold out for a while now my
next tidbit is to go in with a little
bit of concealer I'm just going to apply
it on my darkness I'm not going to be
highlighting the whole face and this is
the NYX HD concealer in shade base I'm
going to use the same brush just to keep
the party moving and we're just going to
tap it out going back and forth second
for second fourth which really helps to
get in the creases in that way you don't
have any missing areas of concealer and
if you want to skip foundation and
you're feeling like you're not in the
mood for it you can also just add a
little concealer to cover the darkness
just anything to get you out the door to
be honest because we don't want that
sleep we helped make that beautifully
I'm going to take a little bit of the
NYC loose powder and set just my under
eye area I have to do this if I put a
concealer down I can't just neglect it
like I have to set it you don't have to
bake or anything you know but I get the
time a day for that you can just apply
it and if you notice I put the concealer
on my eyelids too because we're just
going to use
the eye shadow primer I'm inhaling power
I'm going to take my favorite drugstore
bronzer the butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula and a five m58 one
brush I'm going to swirl my brush around
in it and as you can see I'm looking a
little pale so I'm just going to hit
these areas with a little bit of bronzer
I'm not going to contour and try to
structure out some cheekbones we're just
literally going to hit it with just a
touch of bronzer to give us some color
on the skin girlfriend all I say
yourself a little bit of time for the
highlight you don't have to do this step
you can skip it if you're really in a
harlot hurry really in a hurry you can
skip this step but um I'm going to hit
it with a highlight so this is the
master chrome highlight this one is my
Maybelline this is a pretty golden one
I'm going to use my inside pin brush oh
my god is so pretty just for eyebrows
I'm just going to take this lore'l brow
stylist pencil comb the brows up give
you a nice full beautiful thick brows
girl just skip this step if you're like
me and your brows are missing a few
areas we'll then we'll just fill it
right on in and keep the party moving
I'm just going to take the brush on the
end of this brow pencil and comb through
and whenever you're really in a hurry
getting ready remember eyebrows are
sisters not twins sometimes they're not
even related now let's jump into our
eyeshadow I'm going to take my r39 brush
my favorite blender in this little NYX
palette it is the ultimate palette in
sugar high I talked about this in my
favorites video if you haven't seen that
check it out so we're going to take this
neutral nelly shade right here on the
brush tap it and we're going to add a
little bit in the crease
now I've already primed my eyelids with
my concealer so we can skip that step if
I just pops a little on the lid while is
blending it out just to speed up the
process so what I'm doing is I'm
flickering the brush back and forth back
and forth and then I'll take what's over
love and push it on forward and then
we're going to why make sure it softly
blended you can leave your eyelid kind
of like this and just do a matte neutral
look or you can add a pop of shimmer on
it if you want but this literally takes
me around 30 to 45 seconds just to go
back and forth is a pretty light hand as
well oh wallah you could leave it like
that literally 30 seconds wham bam done
now I'm going to go back in with that
highlight rub my finger in it like that
and we're going to pop it on the eyelid
and this is for those of you who just
want to kick it up a notch and add just
a little bit more glam to your look this
literally takes seconds not even a
minute second stat on you're doing it
with a finger no fancy brushes involved
done surprise 100% optional but if you
want to take a little into10 brush and
sweep it across your lower lash line you
can totally do that as well you don't
have to I think it looks really pretty
without it as well next I'm going to
curl my lashes and pop on a little bit
of mascara today we're going to be using
the Loreal lash paradise love the stuff
it's a great drugstore mascara who
notice that I skipped blush and I did
that participantes I don't wear blush
and whenever I'm really really in a
Harley early
why should I say the word when I'm
really really in a hurry
skip it because I feel like it's not
something mandatory to get a really
complete beautiful look do a light blush
yes what is it mandatory no I'm going to
take a beige at babe this is a nude
loopy from Maybelline and pop it on my
lips this is our final look guys what do
you think
look I'm missing a patch of my lashes
