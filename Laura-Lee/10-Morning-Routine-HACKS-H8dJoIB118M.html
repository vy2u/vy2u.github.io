partnered up with Jerkins for you 10
hacks to ease your morning and comment
down below of you hit the snooze 10
times every morning I know I do for a
hack number one it's actually an alarm
clock hack and this is when the Tyler
has used for so long you set your alarm
 further away from you but close
enough where you can hear what makes you
get out of bed to turn it off and that
way you're already out of bed and ready
to go next hack involves self tanning
the easiest way is to use the Jergens
natural glow daily moisturizer you can
use this every single day you can
customize your tan and build your glow
gradually after some time you will see a
tan slowly develop and it looks so nice
and warm you just add it wherever every
single day and build up that tan for our
next hack is whenever your clothes are
wrinkled but who has time to iron who
wants to iron so what you can do is hang
them in your shower and the steam from
your shower will release some of the
wrinkles if that doesn't work you can
put a damp cloth in the dryer and dry
them hack number four is for hiding
cellulite I'm going to be using the
Jergens natural glow firming what I love
about this is it reduces the appearance
of cellulite in as little as seven days
you should use it daily all over your
body and use it sparingly on your knees
elbows and ankles for hack number five
this is one that a lot of people do and
it's a time-saver brushing your teeth
while you shower it's just an easier
process and for me I have really
sensitive teeth so cold water hurts them
so actually the warm water from the
shower just makes this more easy and a
pleasurable experience my next hack is a
reminder hack if you need to do
something important in the morning make
sure you put a sticky note on your
mirror or just something that you know
your
see maybe your car keys your purse your
mirror your steering wheel in your car a
hack that I always did was hack number
seven lay out your clothes the night
before and really just prepare yourself
all around the night before fix your
lunch lay out your makeup know your
shoes you're going to wear find your car
keys put them in your purse get
everything together the night before
including charge that cell phone hack
number eight is one that I neglect the
most but drink water you wake up
naturally dehydrate it so fill your body
full of goodness water hack number nine
and ten are great hacks if you have the
willpower to live by them number nine is
set your phone on airplane mode to end
all distractions playing on the cell
phone is the worst way to ruin time in
the morning the next one is to live by
the rule if it can't be done in two
minutes then save it for another time
the morning is crunch time and it's time
to get ready and get out the door thank
you guys so much for watching be sure to
subscribe before you leave and I hope to
see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
