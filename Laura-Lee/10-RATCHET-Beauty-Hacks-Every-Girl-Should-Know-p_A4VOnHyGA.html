channel today's video is gonna be a real
ratchet Beauty packs that's right I said
ratchet and I also put it in the title
of the video so these are gonna be
ratchet not your average normal cutesy
Beauty houses a ratchet beauty hacks man
is a one more time to get it in your
head
wretched beauty hacks meaning their
little janky but they do work so I hope
you guys enjoy all 10 of my ratchet
Beauty hack and be sure and subscribe to
my ratchet Channel before you leave
let's get started our first ratchet heck
may not apply to everybody but it
applies to me and that's all that
matters here for those of you who are
too lazy or supposably just don't have
time to go to their hairdresser and need
to cover those roots just part your hair
where you wear it every day and just
apply the hair dye right on the part I
like to part mine in the middle and on
both sides so I just apply my hair dye
to cover up my Gray's in the middle and
on both sides everyone will think you
just freshly got your hair touched or
that you're too lazy to go to your
hairdresser so you just did it yourself
what your face looks like you went
cooking some Chicka Chicka fry fry on it
and the grease is just pouring out there
is a solution and it's toilet paper just
go to the bathroom and in the middle of
your little tinkle Winkle grab a sheet
and press it to the face and it will
quickly absorb all that chiki chiki
refractories yes girl you were looking
back for day this also works for toilet
seat covers but don't get caught doing
it because if you do you're gonna be an
awkward situation and do not relate back
to this video
don't have an angled brow brush on hand
but do have some ratchet scissors to
barely work and a flat brush no problem
here all you got to do is cut half of it
off and voila there you now you have an
eyebrow brush now you don't have a flat
brush to smooth out your under-eye
anymore but don't worry about that
because your eyebrows will be looking on
fleek and no one will be looking at your
eyeshadow out in public and then boom it
hits you the psyche psychic didn't put
on deodorant this morning well don't
worry just grab a squirt of that hand
sanitizer I apply it to your pits the
anti bacteria will kill this Thank You
stank bacteria under your armpits you
will be smelling fresh and fly I only
recommend doing this like once or twice
this is not in every day hat go buy your
deodorant there's no worse feeling in
the world whenever you're trying to
twerk your little bootie off and then
all of a sudden you feel the chase the
like chase but you know I already got
you covered all you gotta do is take a
little bit of dry shampoo I personally
hear your travel size with me everywhere
I go check around make sure no one's
watching because this may get awkward
and ply it down your pants that's where
I apply it on your thighs dry shampoo is
a powdery substance that will then ease
the chase don't carry dry shampoo with
you well now you do elbows actually
enough to start a fire well don't worry
instead of using lotion like any normal
person won't do you can use chapstick
that's right you're out in public don't
have lotion on the end just grab a tube
of chapstick lip gloss what on use lip
gloss that's you sticky sticky with
chapstick and apply it to the elbows and
it will moisturize them and put that
fire out girl
Laura what are you doing with a panty
liner and why are you putting it on your
face you little weirdo that's for your
coochie coach okay now she's cutting in
half let's see where she's going with
those those ratchet scissors don't
really work and she's applying it to her
under-eye girl get that off your face
wait a minute she using that to catch I
should have fallout this girl is nothing
shy of a genius would you look at that
having breakouts
well don't worry grab a tube of
toothpaste in PI it to your face to base
has drying properties in and they will
dry out those zits and also leave your
face smelling minty fresh you're welcome
back at it again with the roots if your
roots are showing whether they're blonde
brown or gray like mine I have a
solution I have lots of solution for the
roots issues grab a little bit of dip
brow pomade it clings to the hair and
we'll cover those roots it's a temporary
fix but hey it works now you may have
seen people apply eyeshadow to your
roots but this is guaranteed to work 90%
better
Laura Lee guaranteed don't really know
what that means
ever beat your face so good you think
the whole world deserves a chance to see
it twice well I have a solution
sleeping hair makeup and I have a way
you can do it all you need is an
airplane pillow and lock your head into
that pillow and do not move side to side
it is so easy you will wake up with a
fresh face in the morning thanks for
watching my Reggie Reggie hack be sure
not to tag me because the Internet
should never know that you're doing
these things love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
