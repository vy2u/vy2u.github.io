video is gonna be talking about our lips
big lips have been a trend for quite a
while now and so I wanted to show you
guys a couple of different hacks and how
to make your lips bigger without getting
lip fillers I have absolutely nothing
against lip fillers actually I'm all for
them I think if you don't abuse them
they look absolutely amazing today's
video we're gonna be talking about have
not spent that much money because they
are expensive bicha lips looking bigger
just by makeup products and just little
things you can do around the house DIY
you know girls gonna hook you up but
anyways I hope you guys enjoy the video
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
before you live and um yeah let's make
our lips look bigger okay our first hack
is exfoliating the lips and as simple as
this seems it actually works because it
stimulates a blood flow within your lips
and can plump them up slightly and it's
a bonus because it polishes away any
dead skin on your lips leaving them soft
and fresh for you to apply any lip
product this one that I'm using here is
by Tarte or you can just use sugar to
exfoliate your lips next one is lip
contouring to do this I actually like to
line my lips with strip down my Mac
which is a darker brown color and then
I'll also line the inner corners of the
lips and then I'll do the same thing to
the bottom lip I will line the bottom
lip in the inner corners and then the
trick is to apply a lighter color in the
center of the lip lip contouring is just
the illusion of your lips looking bigger
I probably do this three or four times a
week it's my favorite method of making
my lips look bigger and it works the
next lip pack is one that we've seen her
on YouTube for a while is the lip
suction now these are not always safe
especially if you've had lip fillers you
shouldn't use them you shouldn't suck on
them very long because you can cause
damage to your lips but if you do it for
just a little bit it will plump your
lips I just do it for a second and hey a
little bit of plumping so a very simple
hack that works is applying a bit of
gloss into the center of your upper and
lower lips when the light hits it and
bounces off and gives the illusion that
you got a big a pout the next hack is
easy peasy lemon squeezy
it's just applying a little bit of
shimmer or highlight to your Cupid's bow
into the upper lip I also like to apply
it in the center of the bottom lip same
concept whenever the lip bounces
off of it it just gives the illusion
that your lip is a little bit bigger
than it actually is
the next hack is moisturizing your lips
so your lips actually don't have oil
glands so they're prone to so much
dryness the drier your lips as you can
imagine they shrivel up and they look
smaller so by applying a vaseline or
your favorite lip balm constantly to
your lips helps them to look plumper the
next one is an awesome one that
celebrity makeup artists use to make
their clients lips look bigger it's
mixing a little bit of cinnamon with
Vaseline will stimulate your blood
vessels and cause your lips to swell up
a little bit you might notice a little
tingling that is normal next up is an
easy peasy one - it's just shadowing
your lower lip and it cost us to look
like you have a bigger pout than you
actually do I do this every single day I
just apply my favorite bronzer right
underneath that lower lip you don't want
to add too much because it can give you
a little 5 o'clock shadow but it just
can make your bottom lip look bigger
haigo haye the next one is peppermint
oil peppermint oil pretty much does the
same thing as cinnamon does it causes
the blood vessels to flow a little bit
more and stimulate your lips making them
look a little bit bigger and this is
just easy-peasy it's actually found in
most plumping glosses for scum sores in
who has peppermint oil on hand I
normally don't there are a bazillion lip
plumping glosses on the market here are
two by buxom they work very well the
next is a very simple old-timey trick
it's just over lining your lips over
line the Cupid's bow as well as the
bottom lip and leave a boom ellipse
little bigger
