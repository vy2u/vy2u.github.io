hack is storing your hair tools
especially while traveling your hair
tool may be too hot to pack or you just
don't want it to get damaged so what I
like to do is wrap mine up and stick it
like in an oven mitt and then you can
tie the rubber band around it mine's
going to stick this way and I can pack
it my luggage and not worry about my
hair tool for a hair hack number two do
you have frizzy hair is it like frizzy
like my hair well you should embrace
your frizzy hair instead of trying to
tame it what Laura what are you saying
and how well all you have to do is flip
your hair over and instead of tightly
trying to tie it up in a really tight
bun make a really loose bun out of it
and then tie a little rubber band around
it and you will have this nice fluffy
adorable messy bun and voila embrace
your frizzy hair only frizzy hair can
create a bun like that so while
showering and dancing to Justin Bieber
sorry in the shower product build-up is
real and shampooing regularly does not
get it all out so I've been doing this
forever and a day about once a week I'll
add a little bit of baking soda in my
shampoo mix it up and I focus this at
the scalp and you will immediately be
able to tell a difference so just
massage it in your scalp make weird
faces dance around for best effects and
you will immediately I'm telling you be
able to feel the difference in your
roots and you'll be able to feel the
product breakup gone hack them for
alright so for the short ponytails out
there we're going to extend the ponytail
and make it like we have a really long
hair without extensions that's right
people really don't care without
extensions so all I'm gonna do is tie up
the first half of my hair I basically
just cut my hair in half
turn it up into a half holding turnt up
then I took the other part of my hair
and I tied it into another pony right
below the top one I'm going to tighten
it I will let you know this works better
if you don't have a lot of layers like I
do and if your hair is curled or has a
little bit more body than mine
but it still works and I doubled the
length of my pony / hack number if I
believe it or not is really important to
clean out your hair brush because
product build-up can cause problems in
your scalp so what I like to do is take
the end of a rat tail comb and you can
literally get your brush clean out in 30
seconds and then I will take a little
bit of rubbing alcohol and clean all
that product build-up and dry shampoo
off the edges look how nasty that is
that's embarrassing don't judge me pump
stop judging then I'll go the extra mile
and I'll take a little hand sanitizer
and spritz it let that alcohol kill the
germs and voila our brush is clean in 30
seconds for hack number 6 like literally
all this hair is mine that you're about
to see it's just crazy and sometimes I
look like a wild animal so a hack here
is whenever you go and strain your hair
do you ever find it to be just super
limp and flat and have no volume
whatsoever so a trick I like to do is I
like to take the flat iron at the root
and straighten straight up into the air
just take those roots and go sraight up
don't pull downward which is typically
what most people are used to doing and
you'll be absolutely amazed at the
volume at the roots of your hair see my
hair straightened but it still has
volume at the top
alright / hack number 7 I'm going to
teach you guys a trick for those of you
who have thin hair or just can't figure
out that really fat Pinterest side braid
that you see chicks wearing you're going
to put your hair in a side ponytail then
split it front to back
then you will tie a little ponytail and
the front one and create a hole you will
pull the back ponytail through the hole
and do the exact same thing create
another ponytail on that back piece of
hair that's pulled through create a hole
pull the front piece through you'll do
the exact same thing again create
another small ponytail make a little
hole out of it and pull that back piece
right on through and then at the end I
just tie it together so it doesn't look
that cute yet so the key actually is
pulling the ponytail apart and look how
fat this fake braid looks it looks like
I have a massive massive amount of hair
if you have thin hair this is going to
be a gym for you for hack number 8 I'm
going to tell you some things about dry
shampoo first it can be your best friend
second if your hair is lifeless spraying
your hair go to bed wake up it will give
you the most texture and volume you've
ever dreamed up next once you spray in
your hair you want to actually let it
set there for like 10 seconds to absorb
the oil in your hair also if you're like
me and continuously put way too much
shampoo in your hair don't brush it out
just get a blow dryer and blow majority
of it out immediately before it starts
to absorb in your hair and voila you're
welcome
dry shampoo Hat hack number nine
involves hair tools so if your hair tool
is no longer giving you those glossy
curls or has that nice ionic touch to it
it's because it has too much buildup on
it and you need to be cleaning your hair
tools so the best way to do that is
whenever it's kind of warm after you
turn it off take a little bit of alcohol
and clean the ceramic area and your hair
tool will work at its best ability
that's just nasty for hack number ten I
can never grasp the concept of how
exactly to do a fishtail braid
especially on my hair so I would have a
hack that teaches you how to make like a
fake fishtail braid all you're going to
do is create a side ponytail or wherever
you want your fishtail braid to be
you're going to part the hair in half
and flip the ponytail through you're
going to repeat the same steps all the
way down your hair I'm parting it in
half I'm going to flip the ponytail
through you can flip it backwards or
forwards I don't see that it makes a
difference and I can normally do this
about three times in my hair and then
I'll stretch it out a little bit and we
have a fake fishtail braid for hack
number eleven which is our final hack is
baby Here I am The Queen of flyways or
baby hair is story of my life
so no better trick than getting a
toothbrush spritzing it with a little
bit of hairspray preferably a new
toothbrush and tying down those baby
hairs especially if you're trying to get
that tight sleep fun this worked like a
gym I mean look at how many baby here so
it just makes it look so nice and sleek
whether or not poofing off your face I
love this hack and that is it for this
