going to be showing you 15 that's right
15 different hairstyles per bag school
we're gonna do them heatless and we're
going to do a quick and they're gonna be
super easy and all you need it's just
like bobby pins and rubber bands just
super simple stuff like that it cannot
wait for you guys to see this this video
is gonna be so much fun and I will be
using some new products from Tara Smith
they have all kinds of products and they
have these cute little birdies on which
oh my gosh I love so much and I just
want to let you guys know before we
start the video I did use the thickening
cream in the hair while it was damp and
then I blew dry my hair and my hair is
just blow-dried it had no prior heat on
it so just know that while doing this
tutorials also I have a discount code is
tarah 10 for $10 off your purchase of 35
or more and free shipping so that's down
below but I'm telling you a lot of these
hair tutorials will work best if they
have a little bit of texture in your
hair that's why I use the thickening
cream just to give it some sprucing up
and texture and then you'll see me using
a couple other products just to do
serums to smooth it out and things like
that they're all by Tauruses and all
these products are cruelty free vegan
organic and chemical free so it'll be
really nice for your hair I'll have
everything below so chicky L please give
a thumbs up if you did learn some new
hairstyles and we're just gonna jump
right in and we're gonna do our hair for
our first tutorial I'm going to be
taking the first half of my hair right
up front and I'm gonna French braid it
to my head which is simply writing the
hair and then grabbing an extra piece
and then braiding it on where it's
basically stuck to the top of your head
this one is going to be easy peasy lemon
squeezy but just to let you know all
these tutorials are going to be super
simple then I'm going to secure it to my
head with two bobby pins and that is it
for this first tutorial and then I'll
add just a little bit of the shining
moment Glosser just to give our hair a
little bit of a glowy shine finish
then I'm going to take that exact same
braid and take the bobby pins out secure
it with a rubber band that way the braid
does not come loose for this next
tutorial I'm going to add a little bit
extra shine to it because I like the
front of the hair to have this nice
glowy shine and then I'm going to take
the other pieces of my hair and I'm
going to simply braid it and that way we
have that braid in the top of our hair
bright it down into the bottom and it
creates this super chic braid or
domestic cure it with a little elastic
and then I am going to leave a lot of
excess hair at the end that way we have
room to stretch out the braid it may get
kind of messy and fast tada and that is
it for our next one this is my favorite
I take a little headband I wrapped
around my head and then I wrap my hair
up and I took it in the headband this
one's actually going to be a little bit
easier if you have shorter hair but then
I just focus on making sure all the
pieces are tucked in nicely that is the
only thing I use for this look how easy
it literally took me 30 seconds to do
this hairdo oh my gosh and it is so
freaking cute this is probably my
favorite of all next we are going to
take the hair right from the top of the
ears and all the way up to the top of
the head then I'm going to secure it
into a little ponytail on top of my head
I'm going to tighten that ponytail and
just give it a little bit of extra chic
mess I'm going to take a little piece of
hair wrapped around the Ravana and bobby
pin it in the back and that way that
just cleans up the look a little bit and
well now we are going to actually create
a look using that half of half down
hairdo I then wrapped my hair up and
created this little bitty ball on top of
my head then I went from the very center
and I started pulling it out which made
the bun tighter at the roots and then I
bobby pin the bun to the head and we
basically had this really cute half-up
half-down updo next I'm going to part
the hair in the middle creating a butt
cut and then I'm going to French braid
the pieces down to the sides of my head
next I'm going to tuck the pieces behind
the ear and I'm going to secure it with
one bobby pin I'm going to do the exact
same thing to the other side of my head
French braiding it down the side of my
head tucking it behind the ear and
securing it with one bobby pin use as
many bobby pins a few as you need but
the smaller you make the braid the
easier it's going to stay in place and
that is it for this hairstyle and it is
so freakin cute for back to school it's
adorable and it looks like you spent so
much time on your hair then I'm going to
of course miss the hair with the Glosser
I love the way this stuff makes my hair
shine for the next one we're going to
need a bandana and I'm going to part my
hair on the side pulling down any
straggly pieces just to make this one a
little bit more messy then I'm going to
take my hair put it in a half ponytail
and then one more time put it another
hot ponytail I'm going to start pulling
the big bun forward and then we have
this weird ball on our head and you see
all that messiness hanging out we're
just going to secure it down and kind of
tuck it in and clean up the look just a
little bit then I'm going to pop the
bandana on top of my head I'm going to
add a banana clip in the back to keep my
bun sticking up and I'm going to pull
down any excess pieces but that long
weird string of hair actually pin that
in the back and I'm gonna gloss my hair
for the finish this Gloucester's my
favorite product it's my favorite hair
product at all times I'm obsessed with
it anyways so it I mean look how shiny
my hair is okay let me stop next
hairstyle I'm going to apply my hair in
a big ponytail I'm going to take it
split it in two pieces and twist those
two pieces around then I'm going to take
those two pieces and I'm going to twirl
them around and that is going to give us
this really cool it's not a braid it's
just like a rope in our hair and I am
going to secure it with a rubber band
kind of important for this one is to add
a serum because the Rope kinky looks a
little drier hairs can shoot out but I
added this base coat serum by tauren
Smith to smooth out all the pieces
shooting out the rope braid thing shim
dig here and then I just smooth the hair
down next I'm going to tie my hair up
halfway and then I'm going to stop with
a little bun in the back not pull it all
the way through I'm going to split the
bun in half and take half the hair
hanging down and wrap it through tucking
it under I hope you understood that and
we had the cutest bow in the world in
the back of her head oh my god how cute
is that and it literally took me less
than one minute to create this hairstyle
perfect for back to school and it's
adorable
for this next one I'm going to take the
first half of my hair I'm going to
backcomb it a little bit or tease it and
then I'm going to secure it down with a
bobby pin
creating what I like to call a pouf then
I'm going to lift the rest of my hair up
into a high ponytail being sure not to
pull the poop out and I'm going to do
that half fun our that half ponytail and
then do it again just like I did for the
bandana starett style and pull the hair
tight then I'm gonna secure it to the
head tying down all the loose pieces
that way it's not too crazy and we have
this volumous messy bun next I am
simulating plant spraying the Glosser in
the hair because you need to put some
type of gloss shine down to slit down
the first half of your hair and make
sure you haven't but cut and I'm going
to take those two pieces tie it around
the back of my head secure it to this
weird little ponytail like that I'm
gonna let down the crown of my hair keep
in mind I do have the thickening cream
in and it's going to help this part so
much I tease the back of my hair but I'm
telling you guys the thickening cream
like look at the volume at the top of my
hair it's this thickening cream Betar
smith you're gonna need some kind of
texture in your hair for that one this
one I'm going to flip my hair over to
the opposite side of my head
secure it making a ponytail then I'm
going to turn it into a Topsy tail by
flipping the hair through I'm gonna do
the exact same thing all the way through
the ponytail this creates a fake
fishtail braid and it is the cutest
braid ever because I flipped my hair on
the opposite side of my head
my hair has more volume on top for this
next hairstyle again I'm going to tease
the crown of my head I'm going to apply
a little bit of gloss err slicked down
the front of my hair and then I'm going
to create this ponytail with a lot of
volume in the back this is a very chic
nice ponytail and just to make it a
little bit chic er of course I'm going
to cover the rubber band with that piece
of hair wrapping it around and securing
it with a bobby pin look at cute this
ponytail is alright for our next
hairstyle I'm going to flip my hair over
I'm going to tie it up on top of my head
and I'm going to pull just the front
half of my hair see that just the front
pieces to pull the hair up and then I'm
going to pull out the top half of my
hair just to give it some volume and
some lift and then we have this adorable
high ponytail when I cover the river
band just to clean it up a little bit
secure it with a bobby pin I love this
high pot Holly tail it's kind of a go-to
for me lately actually next I'm going to
take a little bit of serum because you
don't want your ends to be frayed and
I'm going to shine up those ends and
make it way more sleep yeah chants Cara

to school I hope you enjoyed this video
