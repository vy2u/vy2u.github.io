video is going to be obviously
fifteen-year shelves for short hair I
did back in the past 15 years cells with
the long hair I have a guest star today
this is my 12 year old niece Aaron he's
warming up to the camera warmer world

hey finish another Senate seat already
finishing each other students this sis
feed the chicken you got lipstick yeah
you love being Ofuro you like get it
kink in it rub your finger second high
mmm
we really hope you do enjoy them I think
it's awesome because with short hair you
feel like you're limited but you're
really not limited on hairstyles because
to me it was even easier than when I did
the 15 hairstyles on my long hair cuz
long hairs just doing my jumping right
in our first tutorial I'm going to put
the hair too low piggy tails just part
the hair down the center and then put it
in two pigtails and I'm going to spray
it with some texturising spray and tease
each fun next I'm going to wrap each
piggy tail around in a circle and take a
small elastic and just tie it around
twice
and you have a low space fun so cute I
do the exact same thing to the other
side obviously and then you can bobby
pin any hairs that shoot out or the
buttons hang low you can pin them up
tight like I'm doing this one and this
really works great for short hair our
next hairstyle is a super elegant one I
love it I part the hair down the middle
and twist it and just pin it like two
bobby pins and then I do the same thing
to the other side from the right side I
twist it and then I bring it over to the
left side and then I just apply two
bobby pins and then you have like two
pieces of hair hanging off each side so
what you're going to do is start tucking
those hairs in randomly and pinning them
you just twist them and push them in and
bobby pin on and then it turns out to be
really nice elegant look you just kind
of play with it and make it your own but
the
be great for a wedding or bridesmaid
hair especially for short hair a okay
this next hairstyle is a little less
involved all you take is two pieces of
hair from the sides of the head and you
do them in a regular braid at fish pray
whether type of braid you want to do and
then you bobby pin them back and it
gives you a nice pretty look and it
literally took me two minutes to do this
look and for our fourth hairstyle we're
going to play off this one so you'll
braid the two pieces of hair back and
you'll create a low ponytail and just a
clean it of them and take a piece from
the back of the points out and wrap it
around the rubber band and then pin it
and it looks so elegant and secure and
beautiful in this hairstyle again it's
just super easy it takes no time it
looks beautiful
our next hairstyle is a creative one I
just take the top of the hair and put it
in a little bun flopping the end pieces
over on top of the forehead and I'm
going to be making faux bangs how could
you and you don't have to commit to real
bangs so then I pinned the piece of
shooting off to the side and it secures
the bangs I got this little headband at
forever 21 you can add whatever headband
your heart desires and then just pin the
headband to the hair and it's just like
bangs for the day could you go ahead to
commit isn't it wonderful
our next hairstyle we're going to put
the hair on a high point on top of the
head and I'll show you how we take care
of those hairs they're going to fall
down in the back if you have short hair
the next time I take my way texturizing
spray
I obviously love those bump and then I
tease the crap out of the hair just go
crazy get wow get stupid okay then I
take the back pieces of hair and pin
them and just twist it around the more
texture and tease that here has the
easier is mega bun so I take the back
hair and I do a twist which secures it
from falling down and looking straggly
and then I pin all the way down the back
twist and it looks like a cute elegant
messy bun for short hair this one's a
little bit easier to the hair and I put
it halfway up and then I tease the back
of it teasing hair just gives a little
more texture it's a little bit easier to
work with and I put it in
have fun and I take a little piece of
hair hanging out the bun and wrap it
around the road band just to clean it up
a little bit and literally that is it
just easy - second hairstyle and it's so
cute for short hair I love it our next
one my sister out of stepping she is the
braid Queen we just put the hair halfway
up and we fish tilt the pony hanging off
the back then we're going to do
something with a fishtail how she
fishtail she takes a piece all the way
from the far left side and tucks it into
the far right side and then vice versa
and she does that all the way down if
you want to do a regular braid if it's
easier on this one for you it will still
work this thing by all means I just
wanted to do a fishtail because I
thought it'd be really cute and we just
secure it with a robe and
all I do then is just tie it around and
make like a little knot out of it Duke
and then we pin it with a bobby pin and
literally this is like the cutest little
hairstyle but as you can see a regular
braid would work like the exact same
with it if you're not into the fishtail
I love it alright I think this one might
have been my niece Erin's favorite so I
put the hair high up into tall pigtails
and secure it with a tight rubber band
and then I tease the crap out of the
hair you guys know I'm all about teasing
just like SM exists a better and I twist
the hair around honestly how to play
with the bun to get it to a cry I twist
around two or three times just to see
how I liked it and then I would pin it
next I braided the pieces falling down
in the back and secure them throughout
the braid with a bobby pin and there you
have space buns for short hair and it's
so freakin cute for our next one I had
to bring the system back in because she
is like the Queen a beret it's ok let me
stop singing so what she's doing is
Dutch braiding the hair to the top of
the head you can French braid it to the
top of the head Dutch braid to the top
of the head regular braided whatever
your heart's desire as you can see my
niece is so not enthused oh but before
she got to the end she just braided the
hair all the way down and then we
secured it with her advance it was like
a little till and then I gathered a
little bit of her other hair with it and
created a bun and then I just secured it
with a tiny goodies elastic and pulled
it through
kind of like a topknot how beautiful is
this hairstyle and it really didn't take
too long
so our next one's going to play off our
last one so we French braid the hair to
the top of the head and what she's going
to do is French braid the hair all the
way down to the back leaving the sides
of the hair out so it's going to look a
little funny at first but it turns way
more elegant this is a really original
hairstyle just so you know I've never
seen this before I was literally like
inventing hairstyles as I go so I think
of my hairstyle in winter now I was
trying to angle the camera so you guys
could actually see what she's doing but
her hair is kind of dark so it's hard to
see the dimension but she just ties it
off and it takes a teasing comb and
slicks the sides down and it puts it
into a tight ponytail she slicks both
sides down and then you can't see the
other side and how cute and like
original is this hairstyle it turned out
really beautiful I know I say that about
every singer style but I was really
pleased with these yes Erin slow lay the
camera again for our next one it plays
off the last one as well her hair still
French braid in the middle and we just
put it in a half a pack down do and then
I put a rubber band around the piece
hanging off and then I gathered the rest
of the hair and tie it all together this
is going to give kind of like a kind of
sort like a Princess Jasmine vibe and
then to clean it up I just take a piece
of hair and wrap it around the rubber
band you don't have to have the top
French braid it just gives a little more
detail if you want to for our next one
we're going to give like the illusion
that half of our head is shaved I mean I
don't know that's kind of why I think it
looks like my sister's just French
braiding the hair to the side of the
head as tightly as she can you can part
your hair on whatever side that you're
most comfortable parting your hair and
you'll just go straight back with your
braid I'm not honestly that great at
braiding hair I just wasn't gifted that
way that's why I'm bringing in the whole
sister she's so good and I used to hide
off the rubber band and hairspray it a
little and voila this is like a two
second hairstyle for our next hairstyle
first you want to pet your nieces head
and I'm just kidding so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to part out the
Brown of the hair and of course you know
what I'm going to do in a backcomb it
tease it spray it with some texturizing
spray to give it a little bit of a lift
and then I'm going to secure the hair
and a low bun well first I do a low
ponytail and that's another herb and in
this the part where I just slide it into
a low bun then I pin the sides of the
bun as well as any hairs that decide to
shoot out I'm not going to lie this one
was a little more challenging but in the
end was really cute so for our last
hairstyle I take the hair on top of the
head and I secure it with a rubber band
by the way sort of last year so um hello
fifteen hairstyles my poor Denise's head
she was so over it comment boogie woogie
if you're a hero to the end of the video
so what I'm going to do is flip the hair
through the ponytail creating a Topsy
tail what we call them in the 90s and
then I pull it through like that it
creates like a not like illusion it's
really cute so then my cat is playing in
the background skill Jia Liu so then I
take this second section of hair and
include that ponytail it was hanging
down and I do the exact same thing I
just flip it through and it creates a
not like illusion and it is so cute you
can also finish it and secure it off but
I left it like this I thought it was
just adorable thank you guys so much for
being here and watching I love you guys
