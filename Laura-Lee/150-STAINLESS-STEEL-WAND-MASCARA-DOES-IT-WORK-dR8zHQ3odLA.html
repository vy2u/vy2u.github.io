think this some expense that I ask
mascara hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be on a does
it work tested out our glass mascara
wand product is the weirdest mascara
wand I've ever seen it's also the most
expensive mascara wand I've ever
purchased and that's just for the wand
then I bought the primer in that actual
mascara which is sold separately which
I'll show you of course in a minute I'm
hoping it's going to work out on my eyes
as you can see I don't have on any eye
makeup and it's because we're gonna be
testing out the mascara and I want you
guys to really be able to see does it
work or not because I don't really know
if it works or not
also be sure and subscribe to my channel
before you leave that way you don't miss
out on all the craziness I'm putting out
on the Internet alright alright
subscribe I see what you did there thank
you for subscribing and we're gonna jump
right in again start to project first we
have the curator curator curator lash
instrument is what it's called it's by
hourglass which is a brand we're pretty
much all familiar with this is sold on
Barney's or hourglass calm this alone is
$78 and then there's tax so it's around
80 bucks and it comes in a really pretty
packaging it's gold it looks like a
Harry Potter like a wizard tree like or
it looks like a um o or it looks like um
and then you unscrew it and you get the
actual mascara one it is clean with no
mascara and it just kind of looks like a
screw that goes in a wall and the
creator of hourglass created this
product because she said that our that
mascara the bristles on the wands don't
allow you to tightline which is whenever
you're getting up in your upper lash lid
that line up in there you're getting
really close and the darker you can get
that the more define your eyes are going
to be but with this one you can do that
with this really expensive one you can
do that it says that you're supposed to
is preferred to definitely use it with a
primer in the mascara this hourglass
that's meant to go
with it so this is the accent primer
this was 36 or 38 I believe 36 and then
here is the realest mascara so you do
the primer first you wipe off the one
and then you do the mascara it's
supposed to do great things let's quit
talking about it let's see if it works
so here's the primer you screwed the lid
off you can see there's like a little
hole to stick the wand down in it slides
right down in it so I'm just gonna
swivel it around like hmmm the wand has
teeny tiny indentions in it which I
think are meant to grab hold of the
lashes I go okay here goes the primer
holy crap so it definitely is grabbing
the lash as well I'm just kind of grout
going all the way to the base and
lifting up but I like the way that looks
look at that how it coated all the
lashes you can definitely tell they all
had the primer on it it says a very
important step is to wipe the brush
cleans up and make it remember cloth and
I just swirled it in there to clean our
little wand now I have the realest
hourglass mascara the exact same it has
like a little hole and oh look you can
like close it like this oh that's cool
now you can see we got it nicely at
coated I'm kind of nervous but we're
gonna do it alright starting at the base
my lashes are really stiff from that
primer like they feel kind of hard
it's definitely coating the lashes
pretty well it's actually coating them
really well
probably should have given you run down
my lashes to begin with but my last just
grow out straight and kind of downward
because false lashes set on them so much
I just go straight down I'm so have a
really hard time getting my lashes to
lift up and actually they're pretty
lifted up compared to most what most
mascaras do for my lashes I actually did
a whole bunch of coats of the mascara
and it didn't get really clumpy and
another thing I liked about it a lot is
most the time if I did that many layers
so every mascara all over my eyelid and
it kept it very clean with that one so
to be honest with you I really liked the
product that's my first impressions on
it I think if your lashes grow up a
little bit more than mine that you would
be super duper impressed with it
we're going to go ahead and do this eye
over here just you know for the six of
doing it and our bottom lishus is well
I'm gonna wipe the one off again this
part is like a lot like having to clean
the one every time cuz it's hard to get
all this black out of it anyway no time
for that so my little ridges in the wand
are stained to black I did my best to
get it clean but they won't even come
out of it so I guess you just leave it
like that alright here I go again with
the primer I just do like a spinning
motion with it and blink at the same
time like it wastes a lot of the mascara
too if you have to clean your want every
time so I don't know about that like
take off all the excess where normally
you would just put your mascara wand
back into there where you keep the
excesses on your wand you know I'm sorry
this is not as easy
I feel like my lower lashes look super
gross and spidery with this alright guys
so this is my final results with it I
like the way my lashes look I think it
worked well if it were an average price
mascara I'd probably wear on the regular
so for the one is 78 and then the primer
is 36 and the mascara is 36 so
altogether it's a hundred and fifty
dollars you guys see my results you see
that it works well you know I think it
works pretty well you know I know we all
have our own opinions um nothing magical
happening with my lashes but do you
think it's worth $150 or do you think
the wand alone is worth $78 let me know
down in the comment section I love
hearing you guys's thoughts on these
products I try out do you think it's too
gimmicky do you think any mascara could
do this trick let me know down in the
comment section below I'm always excited
to hear your comments and that's it for
this video
umm I probably would not repurchase this
this is a fun thing to try out and do
and I'll probably be using it just
because I did buy it and it worked for
until it runs out I guess and then that
will be the end of that you know thank
you guys so much for watching and being
here don't forget to comment down below
and subscribe before you leave and I
hope to see you all in my next video bye
bye see you later
