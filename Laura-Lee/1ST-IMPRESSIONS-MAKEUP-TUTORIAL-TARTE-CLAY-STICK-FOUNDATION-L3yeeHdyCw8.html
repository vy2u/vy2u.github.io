channel I'm so happy you're here today
because I have so many Hot Topic new
items I'm going to be testing out for
you guys
Tarte foundation Tarte I show palette
Tarte foundation the new Urban Decay
there's more the new radiance primer CG
or mascara like I literally have so much
stuff to test out with you guys and you
guys have been requesting for me to test
it out so finally I'm here doing it also
on my Instagram I am doing five days of
giveaway so be sure and go to my
Instagram and lar lonely and enter all
these giveaways that I'm posting do oh
definitely see pictures of loads of
makeup and you will know because they
are in oh good luck on that also be sure
and subscribe to my channel I fell
comment the other day where someone was
like oh thank god she's finally quit
singing that song I'll say oh my god is
sing it in a video
girl you know I ain't gonna stop for
nobody but anyways that without further
ado let's go ahead and jump right in
beauty well this is my face close up and
personal the part that we're obviously
going to start off with the new primer
to us the plastic on it photo finish
foundation primer radiant with a
hyaluronic acid okay it looks kind of
pinky and radiant we're going to rub
this in it definitely doesn't feel like
their photo finish primer it just feels
kind of like a moisturizer I'm out of
focus it still time that's great and it
has a very subtle glow to it if you are
looking for pore minimizing normally
things with lots of luminosity and glow
do not help with that I think the skin
looks really pretty and it doesn't feel
tacky it feels really smooth so far so
good let's see how it wears with the
foundation which is the next exciting
truck I'm going to try out you guys have
been asking me to test this out this is
the clay stick foundation
I'm medium beige medium sand and medium
neutral I really like the little geo
moment on the top I don't even know if
it's called Geo but I make up things
okay I think I'm going to go in with a
deeper color medium neutral this is not
the deeper color but i swatched um and I
think this is gonna be more me hmm what
do you guys think maybe this I don't
know I'm going to try out medium neutral
and we're going to go from there
yeah I'm going to do medium neutral for
sure I'm going to use the Tarte brush
that they're suggesting they're not
really suggesting it just kind of goes
with it so I want to use this brush I
like with the Tarte brushes so to blend
this out you can see it's blending out
pretty easily I'm liking this color on
me I'm going to add a little bit more in
areas that might need some more coverage
that's what I normally do I'll go in
with an amount and just build it back up
like go back in and touch up where I
think I might need some more love all
right here is blended out overall I can
feel it on my skin so it's not
lightweight I like the way it looks on
my skin what do you guys think here's a
close-up I would say it's medium
coverage you can kind of see the
freckles on my nose still but not for
realsies and it definitely has some
coverage through here like I'm covered
oh I need to set it because it looks
like it's trying to creep into my smile
line it looks pretty on my forehead so
yeah not too shabby
next we're going to go ahead and add
some concealer and just see how this
foundation plays with other product this
is the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I
really have a brand-new concealer to
wear so I thought you know I would just
use my good old trusty Mac concealer and
all to use it my eyelids and all around
the cover that darkness next have an
exciting new product to try out the
urban decay
illuminizer this is a translucent
pressed beauty powder and it looks like
this I'm going to wipe my Beauty Blender
in it and press it into my skin and
we're going to see how well the stuff
works to set Zima Cup honestly I see
little flecks of sparkle in it and I see
the word Luminizer so yes I go to hand
in hand but I typically don't prefer any
type of sparkle or alumina zation and my
setting powder girl I want to set it and
forget it and not worry about shine or
sparkles in it I don't know I don't hate
this right off the bat I'll tell you
that let me get a closer looking at them
in my mirror in just a second and I'll
start speaking some truth I feel like my
pores look like the size of Texas right
here and I see like do you see the sheen
the sheen right through here happening
with the setting powder it is
illuminating setting powder but I don't
think this is going to be from me
because girl I think it's like
emphasizing the pores and I do think
it's set to consider well but also grow
the pores before support it feels nice
but I'm a little weird about luminizing
things right here hey let's keep it
moving next we're going to have this I
didn't set all of my face we're going to
go ahead and contour with the new or
McKay shapeshifter palette so you get
the powder side in the cream and color
correction side grabbing some of that
darker shade with creamy I'm going to
start blending this out I normally like
to flick my cream product upward to make
sure it doesn't droop and then we defeat
the purpose of contouring this looked
really dark at first but it doesn't
blend out to be that dark so that's a
good thing they have two shades in it to
have the medium dark one and then the
light to medium one I'm using light to
medium today and yeah they're blending
out really
easily that's pretty it's not like do
you see how this just blended out unless
into nothing and it's like that much
pigment I do like the way it looks still
although it's not that aggressive of a
contour palette and if you're looking
for some major contouring I don't think
this will be the one but I think if
you're like a beginner at contouring and
you just want to start out light I think
this would be the one now it's kind of
deceiving because you're like holy crap
that's dark but like look once you give
it a few blends
it's like sources flipped out really
easily so I personally like this contour
so far I mean I think that looks really
pretty and nothing too harsh very subtle
so I'm liking the contour shapeshifter
palette next I'm going to go in I'll
probably mix these two shades and just
blend it honey only oh okay so this
powder is extreme honey oh Lord
I got some major contouring done here's
like alright so basically we're not
using the top shade anymore because we
realize that that was an abort mission
situation and we're trying to cover up
our mistakes so what happens whenever
you try out new products use don't know
what's going to happen you know you go
in hoping for the best and take it from
there
holy bejesus I just barely tapped this
so we're learning here guys and I
recommend that you really don't go in
with a heavy hand if you have a heavy
hand change it up scroll get a light
hand with this palette because this is
no joke extreme contouring 101 right
here it isn't bad like super condylar
sometime you just take like a cleaner
brush and swipe to lighten your mistakes
like a clean slate all right I think
this fella is nice I like this I do you
just got to use it the right way and
don't hit too cracker lithics then you
will pay for your decisions and so far
everything seems to be nicely playing
with the with the foundation foundation
still looking good this area about to
mattify excess
how shiny this is looking and I take
from my coverfx setting powder and I'm
also gonna just try to set the rest of
my face too while we're at it girl this
is a full beat kind of day you know do
you may see I don't know I think it's a
little more blurred now like that's
better I don't know like it's a little
better it's a little better okay I'm
actually going to see it blush today for
those of you don't know sometimes
there's some wear blush I've been loving
the Maybelline new blush palette if
you're looking for a good new blush
palette that's my girl so I'm going to
actually take the luminizing shade right
here this is the highlighter and it's
subtle but not shabby subtle but pretty
now I'm going to go in with the actual
highlighter and that's pretty they go
well together a pretty highlight now
let's wipe away that excess powder and
that way is left us with a more clean
contour line anyone else lovin my
doorknob earrings they are from H&amp;amp;M and
they were super affordable I really love
to spray things spray all over after I
finished my face and just tap it out so
everything doesn't look so powdering it
looks more that's a much natural but
just more natural
okay the moment a lot of you been
waiting on as usual I'm going to tap
into a light cream color and I'm going
to apply this all over my eye
this just seems like a genius cut crease
palette maybe I don't know I don't know
what look I want to do with it you know
it's all neutral but it's like what do I
want to do I'm going to take this shade
right here and we're going to move this
shade back and forth back and forth and
use it as my transition shade like this
whole area looks Oh grazie and I need to
get over it but it's just I'm looking
into I just keep seeing it and now it's
making me crazy what do you guys think
about that I think it looks pretty good
X am I going with this shade right here
and I'm just going to smoke it out a
little more these shadows are working
out pretty darn good so far lots of
pigmentation as you guys can see and I
think they look really pretty so far
were you guys thinking in the comment
section has anyone bought this and tried
it out what are your thoughts upon this
palette I think that's like really
pretty that Brown like blowed out there
and he looks good I'm going to take a
little bit of this color next this is
the r39 brush and it's got like a taper
flat edge so I'm going to be able to put
the product on one in flip the brush
over and dig it kind of right into the
crease and that way we can keep the
darker color a little bit lower on my
eyelid and it's not blown out everywhere
now this is a super neutral palette how
many of you guys are like a yes on this
palette I always like love to read your
newsfeed on like products like if
there's a note for you this to neutral
is it yesterday's just what you're
looking for I think the eyeshadows are
blending out so soft through here and
look really pretty so that's why I
always just like to hear you're like
what are you thinking wanting this
together I'm going to take a bit of this
darkest brown color and with the same
brush I'm just going to deepen up that
crease even more I'm going to use a
little bit of my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre I'm going to take this synthetic
brush and I'm going to carve it out girl
I'm just filling the cut crease today in
a minute since I've done one oh my
so why not right I'm going to take the
lightest shade from the palette and a
little flat brush and just carve out
that crease and start packing it on and
I know you see getting powdery in the
crease so what we're going to do there
is take that same brush we were using
and just redefine the crease a little
bit I'm going to add some gel liner
winged liner is done I'm going to add
these lashes and I'll be right back I
pop this warmer brown color on the lower
lash line and now I'm going to take a
bit of this deep brown color outside but
I don't want to do and I'm going to put
it right underneath as well I'm going to
pop some black liner right in that
waterline I'm going to take some of this
new mascara which I've already been
testing out this is the Dior pump in a
Volume Mascara and you can squeeze a
little thing and then it has this brush
I love this product so much and the
brush is a little short but it works out
well and as this gel like formula to it
and it just sticks to my lashes so well
and to finish up this look I'm going to
add a little bit of a brand new at Kevyn
Aucoin this is called rose gold sister
new the molten lip yeah these are pretty
really pretty on you I know they're
marnya so pretty I'm having the Smashbox
be legendary lip saw shimmery ones like
petal metal I use them I think my last
first impressions idiot I did with a
makeup tutorial whatever these remind me
of that so much they're very very pretty
first time I tried it out too so that is
it for this look in this first
impressions video some of the products
like I really didn't like this product I
pretty much stared at my under eye for
the rest of the video because it
disturbed me the foundation feels heavy
to me but so far it looks nice on my
skin so I am enjoying it as of right now
I will put in the description box as
always how it wore throughout the day so
you guys can get like a full review on
it the eyeshadow palette was phenomenal
I love the creamy shades I thought they
were so pigmented the lip product was
great actually love I love the urban
decay skin I think this is a really cool
product the do or show mascara is great
and if you want really radiant skin and
you don't have Oly skin I think this is
a great primer for you if you do or have
promise of pores I would probably stay
away from that primer so yeah guys my
review on these products guys thank you
so much for being here and watching be
sure to and I will see you all in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
