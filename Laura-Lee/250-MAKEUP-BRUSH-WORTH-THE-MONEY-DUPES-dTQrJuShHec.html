say one to one though hey guys welcome
to my channel today's video is going to
be a little bit of a different video
because I found something interesting on
the internet specifically at Sephora
calm the quantum blew my mind so I
bought it and now I'm going to share it
with you guys and review it for you guys
and talk about maybe some possible dupes
for it the item I'm talking about is a
brush mm-hmm and it's a crazy price tag
on it like stupid price tag on it and
anyways I just want to talk about I
thought it'd be a fun video to review
things and then loving it I don't know I
don't think there are any announcements
I'm trying to think
no not going on on this neck of the
woods I'm just chilling making videos
for you guys living my life
yes we will jump in and get started but
first we shouldn't scratch my channel
because I make a whole lot of videos and
all of her usual my YouTube fans yep
let's jump right in the brush is done it
is by I'm probably gonna pronounce it
wrong it's okay though the brush is by
soo rad I want to say this is a Japanese
brand and they make makeup as well as
makeup brushes now I found this one so
for calm and the price tag like had my
brain just so confused I believe with
tags I paid around to head over 250
dollars for one makeup brush like excuse
me immediately as I'm buying it I was
like I really want to do a video on this
but then I am paying $250 for makeup
brush so OH
gonna enjoy the brush whether I like it
or not I haven't really even taken it
out of its packaging because I want to
share with you guys but it comes in like
a coffin
strange right and the brush is a powder
brush in case you want to know like I
said I haven't taken it oh it just like
comes completely out of the coffin okay
so you get cute little box I guess that
comes with your $250 that you spend it
is luxurious packaging I'll give them
that and then you take the brush out and
it looks like this and it has the brand
on it and the handle of it is it's like
duochrome it's really pretty the brush
is extremely soft now I read online
these are handmade brushes and it is a
powder brush and it's supposed to do the
work for you that was the gist of all
their online shenanigans talking about
it in my personal opinion I don't ever
think in makeup brushes worth 250
dollars I think money could be well
spent elsewhere hmm but that's just my
personal opinion
that's just your friend Laura's fillings
I love that I always had the crusty as
possible cups then I'm drinking out of
wall filming crate it feels normal
I mean honestly I expected like
fireworks to shoot out of the box and my
main feeling that in half week so
doesn't come with the $250 I'm just
trying to figure out why that's the
price point you have my trusty Laura
Mercier powder here I'm kind of like I'm
honestly kind of nervous to like dip the
brush in the powder I'm like oh now it's
dirty you have my contour on and a
smidge of highlight but I don't have my
powder on yet so I figure I could just
you know okay so it picks up the product
will why am I so weirded out right now
and it feels amazing on but you know
what my other products apply the same
great way by Sigma and morphe brushes I
feel apply the makeup the same way
it's that online you should be able to
use this with like any powder product
loose powder face powder blush if it's
powder product this should work for it
so maybe it's kind of like an
on one brush who likes to use one brush
for everything I mean everybody likes
their blush brush the contour brush the
highlight where she goes all right now
I'm going to apply a little bit of
bronzer with it just because I mean like
that I feel like was on lame
demonstration it picked up the bronzer
well you can see it at the end of the
brush I mean it applies the bronzer will
I just I don't get it
why does this brush cost that much I
mean the material is made out of like
sure it's nice but it doesn't do
anything different than any of my other
makeup brushes do why would someone
reasonably buy this I'm going to go
ahead and just contour around with it
you know and it feels so softened it
feels amazing and great but um now for
that kind of money
I'm sure the longevity of the brush is
long but I can tell you right now I've
had a sigma brush for like four or five
years that should some beaten to death
and she still works fine I paid like
twelve or fourteen bucks for closest
dupe that can find to the exact tapered
shape it has a little bit of a tapered
shape it goes a little rounded and domed
at the top is this one by japanesse it
is very similar in the japonesque brush
doesn't feel quite as thick as the Suat
brush but it does feel just as soft and
it works just as well and it's about the
exact same size so it's going to perform
the same way so here's an awesome dupe
for it you can get these on the
drugstore side at Ulta beauty seriously
now I'm going to put on a little bit of
highlight with it I'm just going to do
all my face powder so it's a little bit
big for highlight but when in Rome we're
not in Roman oh I don't know why I said
that I'm going to take that back that
was really weird I have to know your
thoughts so comment down below your
thoughts on this brush it's so soft it
performs well I'm sure it's long lasting
my other brushes feel the same way so
comment down below what you think about
a 200 video I brush in Sephora is it
wack do you think is what I think it's
wet but don't just say that cuz I think
it's white hell naw hell no tell me if
there's someone out there that would buy
this and think that it's a good
reasonable
product and I'm not here just to bash
the brush I'm here to brush the price
point
huh and even if this brush isn't nearly
as long lasting as a Suat brush I could
buy like ten of these by the time I came
up to this price and then it would like
last the same you know all right so I
know today's video was a little bit
different I hope you guys enjoyed it I
hope you guys I mean it was a brush a
powder brush so that's my review on it
using powders which I know is not the
most exciting thing in the world I know
that somebody out there give me a reason
spent $250 on a makeup brush that's it
for this video I love you guys thank you
so much for being here and watching and
I hope to see you in my next video
subscribe tweet and for those of you who
say to the very end of the video I am
wearing a Smashbox liquid lipstick in
girl gang on my lips I know whenever I
wear color a lot of people want to know
what it is so it's for those who stayed
to the end alright so now I don't even
know I need to do with this brush I
guess I'm going to put it back in this
happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
