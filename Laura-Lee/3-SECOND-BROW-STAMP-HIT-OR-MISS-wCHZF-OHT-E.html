video is going to be on testing out
three-second brow now I don't know about
you but brows normally takes me probably
the longest part of doing my makeup and
I've actually gotten really quick about
it and yes I will do an updated brow
routine I promise you I promise I
promise it's going to come it's going to
happen but anyways this is not my brow
routine
mind you I'm testing out this product a
bunch of you tweeted me this product
like over and over again I was like okay
I'll try it out for you this lip looks
like it's like definitely an infomercial
product I would love to see the
infomercial and health deleted it
totally looks gimmicky you guys know I
love to use that word and so yeah I'm
going to try it out I'm going to wipe
out these brows and we're going to see
if it really is a three second brow or
is it a stupid problem I don't know a
better word for it anyways be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
and let's jump in the video and get
started so I put my a person clothes
mole up person clothes and all hands on
up close and personal lens on so you
guys get a real good look at this moment
here is our product in the bottom part
don't mind my nails oh shoot I kind of
dug my finger in it so it is a powder
and it comes like this protective sponge
on the powder which is like a little
booty thing and then this is what the
powder looks like comes a little mirror
in the compact which i think is cute
here's some info if you want to read
that upside down huh and yeah it just
clicks right on and there you have your
brow prodigious clicks right in there so
you can store it all together I actually
have two different orders I think I
ordered different brows I think it came
with different brow shape in my I'll
link everything down below anyways I
have yeah this is just going to be a
moment for me but anyways I have two
different brow shape and basically the
instructions are super easy it says
whenever you turn on the right way
it says align it with your brow don't
press too hard into the powder but dip
it into the powder and coat your brow
part thingy stamp easily that is brow
pal
by the way and then you know align it
and stamp oh so I didn't order extra it
shows that it comes with yeah both I
didn't order extra it comes with two
different shapes so this is my brow
filled in so I want you guys to kind of
get that visual so we can compare notes
um oh shoot
okay I gotta open this one yeah and it
also took some paperwork to make sure
you're doing your right eye left and
right eye correctly I I'm not this
Archie I would like to try this out
still because I like to think is Archie
oh I think this is going to be more
natural on any bill and like work out
better Oh what are we gonna do you gonna
line it first I kind of get an idea here
that looks good it's just like I just
need to get like the front align and
then I can just kind of press it so
that's what we're going to do I'm going
to go ahead and stamp it and make sure
it's evenly on there well you get to
pick different brow powders as well
obviously I went with the dark brown so
here I go so don't press too hard but I
guess yours are kind of like swipey yeah
that's how you get it you like that if
you guys can see I'm just like swishing
it around in there that top part okay
and she is nice and coated well bam
honey so what I think would be a good
idea is still blow it to get any excess
product off I would do that with any
product
oh my god so scared you're right oh oh
my gosh let me get a close-up Mariel
are you trying to in my eyebrow game so
front that's good alright let's add some
pressure oh I think I got eyelash on
there
oh god oh yeah I'm stamping an eyelash
like wailing my eye is pinned open okay
that is not bad at all at all oh look at
this so what I would tell you what I
would do right now I'm not mad as hard
and I knew this was going to be a
gimmicky joke I would get my little bro
get a little bit of the brow powder on
there oh don't touch it okay maybe
I wouldn't the brow powder does not like
to apply hmm
I mean the thing is it's like a little
sparse in there but that was less than
three seconds I think
what sparks freakin worse Oh
so let me try to tell you one more
little good little e get my lash out of
it this time so I want to press firmly I
press hard
oh okay so don't press hard it's better
the first time but that was not a bad
brow okay and also let me just mind you
mind you that if you use a brow pencil
like I do it can help guide you even if
you like have sparse areas I'm trying to
dig out my brow fence where I now show
you my guide you to be like okay and we
have a little sparseness right there
like dude I'm going to I kind of messed
up led to the second time I thought it
was fixing things and I clearly wasn't
but barse in certain areas like it needs
to be thickened up but I thought it
would be a way worse situation on deck I
think the only thing we need to do next
is go ahead and take off this brow and
let's try it again shall we
so I don't think I'm going to do the
arch one because the other one just
worked out too well so clearly that's
just not my calling you can really tell
them this a broad totally screwed up all
my makeup so that's great but you can
totally tell on this eyebrow that I have
less hairs there she is alright so here
is our next little friend that we are
going to stamp and as you remember
stamping it I just split it like this
and it really got it coated nicely with
a lot of product and absolutely just to
make sure there was no excess here I go
I'm going to line it up well almost got
my lash again
okay I'm gonna press I'm going to give
it a good little
what did I do okay let me try again
I just know what I did wrong I don't
know anyone who used something wrong
there right here I go here I go here I
go let me get it maybe because I didn't
have my good mare closed up like okay
here I go
just real gently okay I don't know what
I'm doing wrong on this brow but he's
trying to play me and it's going to stop
right now
Doby
I think my brows are different shapes
you know what the front part of this one
isn't so bad and I could just do a clean
it up and there you have a nice guide
do you see like if you try to brush it
out or like fill it in the powders I
literally solve off of your face like if
you try any movement with it it just
crumbles and also whenever I try to put
my brow pencil on it earlier eyebrow
pencil is just moving the product so I
don't know what the brow powder is made
of but it is something strange that's
not really workable and I think that
this product my overall thoughts I think
this probably is a good for a guideline
only I don't really think that this is
like the best three-second brow product
I think that it could really help you
sort of see where you need to fill in
areas however I don't know I think the
more you play with it you could get it
down to where it stamps on a nice brow
and it is not as easy I don't think it's
like alright I'm ready to go you know
I'm saying it takes a little bit more
work than that so that is it for the
video
I mean eyebrows are not the end of the
world I mean I'm trying to be like a
realist about it I didn't think that
this was going to give me like those
Instagram eyebrows that I do love so
much I mean I was trying to be like a
realist and think that maybe it give me
like a little soft fill-in you know a
little powdery eyebrow but anyways I
hope you guys enjoyed the video and I
hope you now know about three-second
brow and your thoughts on it be sure and
comment your thoughts down below I mean
this thing wasn't that cheap so DT is
worth the money would you buy it would
