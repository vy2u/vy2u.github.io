that was gonna spin hey guys welcome my
channel today's video is gonna be on 3d
printing is it real is it fake is it
really happening we don't know but we're
gonna find out in this video also I have
a brand new Beauty room that Smashbox
created just just kidding I was gonna
film this enjoy at home but I came here
at Smashbox to find out about 3d
printing and then they had this cool
setup so I just plopped down the chair
and they set up all this stuff and one
bunch of camera people behind me oh and
I got a cool friend Kristen with me hey
guys this is the first ever 3d printed
lipsticks from Smashbox and I've never
heard a 3d printed makeup ever in my
life
I haven't either so crazy we got to find
out more I think it makes for a great
video we're gonna test it out as one of
mine
does it work series cuz we don't know
yet we've never seen it so we're gonna
explore more we'll jump right in let's
go hey guys in today's video we're
talking about 3d printed makeup so this
is something like futuristic and weird
and actually got to play with it at
Smashbox they invited me over to their
studios and I thought it would be a
great opportunity to make a does it work
a video with it and add on to my series
because it's something cool and crazy in
makeup so I went over to Smashbox
Studios and they showed us their be
legendary lipsticks being 3d printed and
like what exactly does that mean
does it work how is it happening like
the whole thing just kind of confused me
because I've heard about 3d printing
before but I didn't even know that it
really existed and some of you guys may
not have so smashbox is innovating it
into makeup so they actually had the
printer there here's a 3d printer and
we're going to be printing out first my
signature that i wrote on the mirror in
there so
see what happens and what we did is we
did our kiss print and they pulled that
print from like our kiss and they
created a 3d version of that so the
printer just was very weird it made
sounds like yeah it was really cool and
we got to close up watch this little
needle spit out lipstick and light like
create exactly the print that they put
into the computer which was our lips and
they did our signatures as well which I
thought was really cool so it definitely
happened and it definitely worked what
the printer does it does like a really
straight line of lipstick it's actually
the be legendary lipstick shade that we
were wearing it's the actual product and
it did like a straight line of it to
clear off the tip with the pin and then
it comes on to the circle tray and then
it like creates whatever design is told
to create and it just pours it in that
is that design and it 3d prints the
lipstick so here are my lips and here is
the creation this is actually lipstick
on this tray and honestly I first
thought that's not a lot of lipstick and
then actually used this one which is
what's on my lips exactly right now and
so that it's pretty thick it's thicker
than what it looks like on the tray and
so or on the mirror I should say and so
that little gash in it right there
covered my whole entire lip either we're
in this lipstick for like probably two
or three hours so it's been on my list
for a while but just this little bitty
gash and it covered my whole entire lip
so I think you could get like a week's
worth of lipstick out of this little
thing you can literally dip your
lipstick brush in this and that's how
you would use it with your finger or
your just your lipstick brush and kind
of paints me to mess it up but look you
just swipe it on there and you apply it
to your lips which my lips definitely
need a touch-up so by the way this is
fireball matte which is one of their be
legendary lipsticks after it was printed
on here and like dried I thought it
would be really hard and like crusty on
there but as you can see it definitely
is it just feels like regular lipstick
so when applying it the lipstick texture
and all the exact same as a regular to
lipstick so it's kind of cool that the
printer doesn't actually change the
formula of the lipstick it feels just
like it did in the tube I think it would
be even cooler if they printed them out
like in the tube maybe we'll be able to
see that one day but as of right now
they're just
running late I could literally like
print like a picture of my cat and
lipstick whatever you want the thing
would do so I just think that that's
really cool that Smashbox is bringing 3d
printing to life a big question I know
I'm going to get asked is are these four
silk and the customer go in and go buy
this as of right now Smashbox is not
selling this but maybe in the future
they might be I don't know they haven't
said but that would be kind of cool if
you were able to send in whatever and
they printed it out in one of their
lipstick shades because I have a hundred
and twenty shades I mean that would be
kind of a cool thing but the next thing
me and Tyler were asking like could you
guys print out like a tube of lipstick
like the whole tube with the printer and
they actually said that they could do
that they just didn't have the container
manufactured to do that so they couldn't
do it like while we were there but they
said it is possible that they can't do
that so yeah that was kind of a rundown
on experimenting with 3d printing and it
was really cool and thank you Smashbox
for letting us come in your Studios and
have all this fun and printing my lips
so yeah that's it for this video I hope
it gave you more information and was
insightful on 3d printing with makeup I
think that that's so cool I think it's
very innovative and I like the texture
the makeup still the same thank you guys
for being here and watching and I'll see
you all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
