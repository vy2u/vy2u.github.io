today's video is going to be a
back-to-school makeup tutorial it's also
gonna be great for those of you who have
to get up early early and get to work
those are you going to college high
school that's gonna be great for my
mom's out there who don't have a lot of
time to do they make it basically any
point in time of your life that you're
in a rush to do makeup this tutorial is
gonna be for you which we've all been
there
also using all affordable products there
off of the drugstore in this tutorial
please subscribe to my channel before
you leave and we're just gonna jump
right in and we're gonna get our face
ready really quick let's go and PS I
didn't use false lashes I know it's a
miracle to start this tutorial off I've
already got my eyebrows filled in with
my NYX brow pencil if you had thick
luscious brows I would skip this step
then I'm going to go in with my
Maybelline fit me poreless and matte
foundation I'm gonna blend it in with my
fingers and I've already moisturized my
skin before I applied this foundation
and I kind of use my moisturizer as
primer that way my skin is nice and
hydrated I've always said in my
tutorials that you can apply your
foundation with your fingers and I'm
finally demonstrating that out you're
also going to avoid a brush strokes when
using a Fingaz just make sure you've
washed your hands before you do this
okay I'm also going to be using this as
an eye primer so just coating the lids
and a little bit of foundation it's not
the strongest eye primer in the world
but we will need this strong as eye
primer in the world then going in with a
little bit of NYX dance the tides and
this real technique blending brush I'm
just gonna blend this light brown shade
in the crease we're not going to focus
on the highs
too much I said highs I'm in eyes you
guys get the point anyways I'm just
gonna blend it back and forth just to
give us a wee bit of definition and that
way our eyes aren't too too plain next
I'll go in with this pearl mania pigment
from NYX I'll have the name listed down
below because I can never remember the
name I'm just gonna dab this on with my
fingers this is a really pretty
champagne gold color and I'm also gonna
pop a little bit in the inner corner
which is gonna open up our eyes and make
it look wide awake ready for the day and
it's gonna look like we spend lots of
time making
it's all pretty pretty and really we
didn't spend much time at all I'm also
going to blend this out with that brush
next going in with a little bit of
eyeliner this is scandal eyes from
Rimmel I'm just gonna draw a small black
line on the upper lash line if you don't
do eyeliner then sweat it don't do a
lotta in this tutorial make this one
your own I have to have eyeliner it just
awakens me a little bit especially
because I'm not doing false lashes so
I'm just going to do a wee line of
eyeliner with this little liquid pen
shim dig here next since when I do in
false lashes we're going to curl our
lashes I'm going to be using two times
mascara when the volumes and one that
adds a link the one that volumes is the
Rimmel runway lashes this is one my
favorite drugstore mascaras and I'm
going to do some pretty heavy coats of
this on my lashes I know we all apply
mascara in different ways my method is
blinking a hundred thousand times I
don't know it just works for me and then
I'm going in with the Maybelline lash
sensational this is going to spread my
lashes apart and this is also going to
give them a little bit of length I'm
also using the lash sensational for the
lower lashes because I want them to look
long and lovely okay
and 100 coats of mascara later we're
going to move on to bronzer i'm using
this golden bronzer from Milani this is
not really contouring here I'm just
warming up the skin and giving it a
little bit of color and warmth making us
look a little bit sunkissed and golden
so basically I'm going to pop this onto
the areas where the Sun would naturally
hit the cheekbone area the temples a
little bit on the nose you guys know and
by the way this little brush is from ELF
it's super affordable and it's great for
applying the bronzer and you can already
tell our skin is just looking so much
more warm and toasty and it is giving it
life yes then I'm going to go in with a
little bit of that NYX eyeshadow pigment
I'm going to run a little bit down the
nose and I'm going to add a highlight it
is such a subtle highlight but such a
pretty color I love this trick guys
remember you can always use your
shimmery eyeshadows as your highlighter
now for lips I couldn't decide what I
wanted to do so I just went with this
NYX gloss I'll have the name listed down
below and I popped a little bit onto the
lips and rubbed it out my fingers
because I didn't want to do too much
gloss after all this is an everyday
simple makeup tutorial and then I just
step it out so yeah lots of handwork in
this video anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial this is the final
look give me a thumbs up for no false
lashes I love you guys so much and I'll
see you all in the next video bye
