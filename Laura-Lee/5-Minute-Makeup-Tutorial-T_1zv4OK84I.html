hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a very different
makeup tutorial but yet a very quick and
easy mega tutorial the one I do this
tutorial to inspire people maybe for
school in the morning if you're gonna
really be curly curly or for work you
know you gotta rush out the door you
have kids you gotta get them ready or
you just like to sleep in like me
personally and you don't have time to
get ready this is a good go-to makeup
look for you hope you guys enjoyed the
tutorial also can we just talk about
this about this foundation can I just
talk about this bronzer really quick I
use this in this tutorial it's called
the Neutrogena healthy skin blends I
love this stuff so much
I feel so bronzed thank you let's jump
right in and get started for this really
quick 5-minute makeup tutorial alright
jumping right in this tutorial first I
have to prime my skin it's just step
that I cannot skip and this is a
silicone based primer so it's going to
fill in those areas that need a little
extra love such as my bigger poor area
then I'll go in with the Neutrogena skin
clearing foundation now this has
salicylic acid in it so it's going to
help clear up any breakouts you're
having as you wear it throughout the day
so it does double the work far as
coverage it is a medium coverage
foundation and as funny thing is I
actually reviewed this foundation many
moons ago on my channel I'm going to
blend it out with a kabuki instead of a
Beauty Blender because that is actually
a lot faster for me then I will go in
with the urban decay concealer and I'm
going to blend that out with a kabuki
because again it's so much faster to do
that than with a Beauty Blender for me
I'm gonna Pat it out just to make sure
everything is seamless and I'm only
placing it under the eyes just to cover
the dark circles we're not trying to
highlight the face and get fancy
then to set everything I'm going to go
in with a skin clearing mineral powder
from nature Gina I like to use a mineral
powder instead of a foundation powder
because it's a lot more lightweight I'm
going to sprinkle this basically all
over my face to make sure we lock in
that foundation and concealer and that
way is stay in place all day and doesn't
try to run away on us now here comes my
bronzer that I'm a little obsessed with
I just got to try this out it's a new
bronzer by Neutrogena and I kind of fell
in love so I'm not contouring whatsoever
I'm literally just popping this on the
cheek area the temple the forehead I'm
moving quick as you can see and no this
is not in fast-forward this is me moving
fast then I'm going to pop on a little
bit of this Neutrogena blush and rosy
it's just going to add a pop of flush to
my cheeks and give me some color in life
next as for eyebrows this is probably
the most time-consuming part of this
tutorial for me I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows with a brow Wiz by anastasia
beverly hills and i'm going to use this
instead of my dip brow because i can do
this much faster than using the dip brow
and i'm only going to really fill in the
sparse areas and then brush it out
instead of try to shape out my brows and
that is going to be a really quicker
step
next the lashes for me to pop on false
lashes it literally will take me 30
seconds but for the sake of the video I
wanted to do a video without default
lashes so I am going to do some mascara
I did add just two coats of mascara I
added one coat let it dry a little bit
then popped on a second coat and that
was it for my eyes can you believe that
now I'm going to go in with this dose of
colors liquid lipstick and I opted for a
lighter more neutral shade instead of a
darker shade for just a quick makeup
because darker shades just take a little
bit more time to apply and a lighter
show you don't have to be so precise the
only thing extra I would do that I
didn't do in the video is use a setting
spray that's it for this video I mean
like how easy and fresh-faced do we look
yes girl work it by the camera thanks
for watching thank you guys for watching
that is it for this tutorial like I said
super easy peasy lemon squeezy I hope
you guys enjoyed if you did please give
this video a thumbs up I'll see you in
my next video bye
today yes do you see
teddy bears I direct myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
