welcome to my channel I'm so happy you
guys are here today because we have a
really amazing product to test out is it
really amazing I don't know I just feel
like saying that um so today's video I
ordered this a couple months ago off
eBay this is a vibrate okay this is a
vibrating and this is a vibrating makeup
sponge and it comes with a little group
and it comes with a little cap and a
sponge and a power button which we'll
get into in a little bit later in the
video but I'm excited to try it out it's
supposed to vibrate and help smooth out
your foundation make your skin look
really beautiful flawless cut down on
texture is supposed to do what kind of
good stuff we'll read the description on
it once we get into the video but I'm
excited to try it out this thing was
like four dollars four dollars and such
a change so super super affordable and
it was like free shipping it's super
lightweight as well so it kind of feels
cheap just right off the bat just saying
we're gonna test this out today and I
hope you guys are excited and yeah let's
go ahead and jump into the video oh but
we haven't sang our song now let's go
ahead and jump right into the video I'm
having a bad hair day today we have
tacos and shark fins all through my hair
and I'm gonna set the camera like this
so you can't see my hair this is a bad
hair day
okay it happens to all of us so with the
sponge first I want you to get like a
real good look it has purple packaging
which is what it had whenever I ordered
it and then boom there is the actual
sponge it was my lighting to my right
there it is you see like that's spongy
spongy now whenever I open the top you
like press down and twist it had the
battery I did turn this on already
before I started some of the video and
it was so super powerful
vibration whenever I first heard all I
didn't work but it had like a little
clear slip protecting the battery from
you know it working so the battery
doesn't run down while it's like in
shipment or in stock so that was cool
but it does come with this sponge and
two other sponges it says the sponges
are cleanse cleanser Bowl washable so
the sponges are washable so you can
reuse them and it has a little sanitary
cap so maybe you could travel with it or
whenever you're storing it after you do
your makeup I have 10 million text
messages video over here okay here we go
Keeney be here kitten meowing I got a
new kitten and we're gonna go over that
in another video but uh I'm a new mom
and I'm trying to babysit a kitten in
filming video hey hey hey you okay you
okay yeah I says it's a smart makeup
tool it's an innovative private priming
we're vibrating makeup applicator that
helps flawless smooth and radiant by
using powerful and delicate vibrations
smart puffs has been created to leave
your skin with a professional finish and
a flawless complexion with over 10,000
vibrations per minute and it has a soft
elastic puffs to give your skin a smooth
tone texture that's the gist on it again
there's like a million of these on eBay
for like four and five dollars if it
works like this could be a genius
product and for such a low price so
let's try it out do for everyone by the
world like I said it took like a long
time to come in because I ordered it off
eBay and then I hope she's not messing
up the mic hey hey hey and then whenever
it did come in I didn't realize that
that was what was in the box and I sat
on it for like weeks I've had this thing
for like a month in my house and now I'm
finally filming with it so I'm behind
first I'm gonna go in with a little bit
of the alarm RCA this is the flawless
fusion foundation I'm gonna use the
shade honey today just in case you were
curious on what shade I'm using and I
just want you guys to hear how powerful
the vibrations are
No so I think we can try two methods
with this I think we could try it
oh this everything so light for me I'm
gonna apply foundation to my face on
this side and then the other side I'll
apply the foundation to the sponge and
see which way works out better better
forever bad I have it turned on let's
whistle it around it says you're just
like okay so I'm just gonna rub it it's
drinking all of my foundation hold it
without the ring to be honest the sponge
feels super super hard it kind of feels
a little uncomfortable on the skin
because this mine is so rough it's
totally this is a pretty full coverage
foundation I feel like it totally just
drank the foundation to death and just
ate up all my expensive foundation so
first of all that's a bit of a bus the
pressure of it it's just like brake hard
the sponge and I feel like my foundation
is smooth but I feel like I barely have
any foundation on because it literally
if you can see this is normally full
coverage it literally just drank it all
up I see like how much foundation just
soaked up
that's not cool not cool so I think our
next test is to put the foundation on
the sponge and try it out I'm gonna get
a clean sponge all you have to do to
change out the sponge is to give it a
twist and they puff off and then you
twist it back up on so I have just a
little dollop there on it Daisy and now
I'm gonna turn it on just wondering -
the foundation was gonna get weird it's
not really doing anything okay cool I
already had my primer on - you
philia is drinking a lot of foundation I
will say I feel like it worked way
better with applying the foundation to
the sponge and then blending out on the
skin but I still feel like the product
is just drinking up so much foundation
like I can just feel the wetness on the
sponge that it's just soaked with
foundation I don't think you're supposed
to wet the sponge at first it doesn't
say anywhere online that this is
supposed to be wet before using it and
this type of sponge is so shallow and
hard it's uncomfortable in the skin and
also this will be weird too wet before
you applied it I'm like a Beauty Blender
so overall let me give my final opinion
personally I think it's a cool
innovative item I get the vibration and
how that could blend it out seamlessly
but I just feel like this drinks up so
much of your product that it's a waste
of foundation so you're spending five
dollars on the product but then you're
wasting tons of money and foundation and
that sucks because I'm telling you this
foundation is pretty full coverage and
the amount that I applied on the sponge
and on my face I should be caked up and
I'm not at all did the foundation blend
out really smooth I think it didn't I
think it blend out even better whenever
I applied at the foundation to the
sponge and then put on my face versus
putting the foundation on my face and
then doing the sponge but I won't be
using it I'm just gonna be honest
products not for me I won't be using it
this just isn't something that I prefer
and like um I don't necessarily
recommend it to you guys either I just
think it's a gimmick I think it's a
gimmick we have a gimmick on our hands
people you don't want to be caught up in
the gimmick world I think this product
is seriously a gimmick though I think
it's a cool idea in theory but it's just
not mastered out like I think it could
potentially be cool there's like a
full-blown soft squishy actual beauty
winner on the end of this or Beauty
Blender that vibrated like that can be
cool or maybe help you get your
foundation super blended out me and
clever a long time ago did the video
where we put on our makeup with
vibrators and it went on really smooth
like coochie vibrators but that's not
what this is well that being said I'm
gonna go ahead and say this products up
gimmick and I hope you guys enjoyed the
video
oh yeah another disaster tested I love
you guys thank you so much for being
here and watching be sure and subscribe
to me
buff oh yeah they and I'll see you all
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
