video is going to be a review on some
exciting palettes that I found at the
drugstore me and I went to three
different Walgreens because basically I
just wanted to find some new affordable
makeup to review him girl Walgreens is
all over the place like have the

for that information and yeah I guess
we'll jump right in the video who show

ready to get started
be sure to subscribe before you leave
let's go so jumping into this video hey
what's up what you doing
I found these pallets from Rimmel and
there are new I found my Walgreens and
I'm pretty excited about them and that's
what's on my eyes today they're called
magnifies shadow palettes eye contouring
I shoulda palette by Rimmel so at all
honesty just review on these pallets
i've swatched them all played with them
all done two looks with them one i'm
wearing right now i have to keep calm
wear gold palette on my eyes right now
to think that i liked most about these
normal palettes is the matte shades nine
times out of ten whenever I get an
eyeshadow palette from the drugstore and
I try out the matte shades it is just
chalky dusty and not pigmented you can
find a lot of good shimmery eyeshadows
that are really pigmented from the
drugstore but it's matched them
struggling with and the matte shades and
these are really freaking good maybe
like this much chalkiness in them but
they're good they're worth the price
also they put these little sponge
applicators in it girl no we playing
with those no more we are using makeup
brushes loose these pumps anyways I like
this one the best because I think it has
a nice arrangement of colors I think it
has a good amount of mattes get a good
transition shade
you know and then it's got good shimmery
shades in it this shimmery shades are a
touch chalky
I have them on my Ella today you can see
that once that you get them on your
eyelid the really pretty issues a swatch
to look what chowky little powdery but
worth $8 these were $7.99 can't beat it
with a stick
I personally am digging these more than
the Loreal a nude or whatever I should
palette they came out with those the
mattes in them or just no and this one's
called London nudes calling it's so
friggin pretty do you a twelve shades
where I should have palette and then the
stupid little foam eyeshadow applicator
which we don't need anymore is
definitely a bang for your buck now
comparing it to a high-end product I I
would say they're going to Cape Alex are
better I'm not that would be a lie if I
try to convince you that these were
better but they open decay naked
palettes are $50 and then this is $8 so
in that sense this potentially could be
a better pallet with saving your money
this reminds me naked - this reminds me
of naked 3 and this one reminds me so
much of naked smoky did Rimmel snatch
some ideas from the Naked palette I
don't know but they sure look similar
and they sure are cheaper and they sure
do work well the only problem with the
lending news color palette is because it
does not have enough math in it to do
like a complete eyeshadow look it
literally has one matte eyeshadow which
doesn't makes much sense to me because I
always have to have I just dug my
fingernail up in it you always have to
have like two or three matte I should
have shades like really smoked out the
outer corners or build up that
transition shade and this one only have
like one cream color matte and the rest
of shimmer so it's like can we get more
mattes in this palette in the London
nudes calling palette I will tell you
the two shimmery shades or crap kind of
they're just like really patchy and more
glitter than they are eyeshadow other
than that I like all the other shades in
it so I guess you could call it hen miss
but mostly a hit on the grunge glamour
palette I personally this just a
personal preference it's not my favorite
power because of the color schemes I
typically don't go for the darker
Smokies palette this have five mats in
it which is good and then the lightest
shimmer shade I don't really like that
much because I don't think it has that
much pigmentation but I will say this
palette probably has the most
pigmentation of
all the pallets I favored out of all the
pallets is definitely the Keep Calm and
wear gold palette I think that it has a
crap-ton of pigmentation including the
lightest shade in it it's so pretty
like I said they are a little bit chalky
but definitely work the $8 like it's not
- chalky it's still wearable and I just
love the color scheme in this one and
you get more mats and good shimmer
colors mixed together I think it's a
really great layout for an eyeshadow
palette and I think the packaging is
cute I like the clear cases melt like
the long slender packaging makes it easy
for travel and hopefully they won't
break because they are in sturdy
packages I think these are definitely
worth $8 I give these a thumbs up in my
book if any of you try them out be sure
and comment down below your thoughts
that's about it for this video I hope
you guys did enjoy it be sure and leave
me a cool comment down below and also
