to do it intro just jump right in and do
a quick simple makeup tutorial without
all that jazz so I hope you enjoy I am
carving out my eyebrows and is just
gonna give them that sharp sleek texture
this is preference if you don't like
your eyebrows to be this unnatural then
you don't have to do it my friend then
I'm gonna go in with iSpy which is this
warm orgy tone color and this is gonna
be our transition shade I'm gonna be
using the e25 brush from Sevilla this is
probably my all-time favorite Sigma
brush because it's just so easy to use
in a universal way but I'm just working
that right into the crease you can't
really tell this color but it helps
soften up that shadow base then I'm
gonna go in with Melrose from colour-pop
this is in their Fall collection by the
way it is this beautiful warm tone color
it reminds me so much of Brown script by
Mac I don't even know what to do but
it's only five dollars versus what
fifteen dollars from back I'm taking the
e25 brush and I'm gonna blend that right
on top of I spy this is gonna warm up
the look build it up make it look
gradient nice and soft make the colors
transition really nicely and then I'll
just go in with a clean blending brush
to blend a little more then I'll go in
with the Marc Jacobs twinkle pop pencil
I think this one is in starlight or
Stardust I'll have it linked down below
but I pop this all over the lid and I
actually did a really heavy coat of this
because I wanted it to stand out big
time
this is perfect for that glam but grungy
look then I went in with straight
trippin I absolutely adore the name this
color straight trippin yo yo okay let's
stop then I blended that right into the
crease what I wanted to do with this
color is to help the dark and the light
colors blend together more that way is
not just like cut off where you see the
orange --red colors and then just the
dark color that way everything is
gradient and it flows on our eyelid this
part did probably take me the longest
just because I wanted it to be really
soft but I didn't want to mess up
the lid color so I went in with this
little defining brush and did that and
then I went in with a clean blending
brush as usual and just softened it up a
little bit more that way there is no
harsh lines I already did my foundation
and concealer and then I'm gonna pop on
a little bit of Melrose to the lower
lash line and then on top of that I'll
add straight trippin which is the darker
purple color closer to the lower lashes
with a short shader brush from Sigma I'm
gonna go in with my favorite
high-caliber lash mascara and give the
lashes a few coats top and bottom lashes
and we're gonna add falsies but if you
don't like palsies literally do not add
them just add your favorite mascara and
wham bam girl there you go then I'm
gonna be using the House of lashes in
iconic which are perfect cuz they're a
little bit grunge and a little bit glam
like what better lashes to use for this
look but like I said if you don't want
to use lashes then do you then I'm gonna
go in with this OCC lip tar or not lift
our OCC lip liner and Sebastian and line
the lips and I'm gonna go in with
Tootsie by color pop their lip istic I
think these two together give it a nice
grungy glam look because the lips are a
little bit gray but then they have a
little bit of a nude color in the center
it just turns out super pretty then
we'll finish the face going in with my
rocket or blush this is just been my
non-stop wearing blush I can't put it
down and partly it's because it smells
so good I'll pop that on to the apples
of the cheek and then oh it's time to
highlight going in I think it's called
so Hollywood I can't remember I can't
remember anything guys but I pop this on
to the high points of the cheekbone just
to give us a little bit of a glow if you
don't want to do that because after all
this is a glam grunge look well then
just leave it off it I love it and then
I'm gonna spritz my face with mac fix+
spray to give everything and enhance a
color that is it for this look I hope
you enjoyed please subscribe before you
leave and I'll see you all in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
