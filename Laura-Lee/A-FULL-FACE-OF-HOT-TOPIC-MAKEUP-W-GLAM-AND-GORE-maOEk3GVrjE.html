I have the beautiful mic Igor she glams
she Gore's she's a rarity on the
internet there isn't a lot of you
there's a lot of she has a fascinating
channel she does special effects makeup
as well as beauty makeup and I don't
know I'm always intrigued by your videos
like today's video on my channel we are
gonna be I bought a bunch of makeup room
Hot Topic she's a lover and I really
tried out any other makeup yet but they
have really cool stuff I'm really
excited about this specific palette Lisa
Frank makeup um it's nostalgia and
makeup we're gonna put her special
effects makeup art to the test actually
she knows what she's doing she's turning
me into an alien yes I'm so scared and
happy at the same time you should just
be scared okay great great
she's like I want to make sure your
skin's gonna survive it I'm like what
does that mean her skin is so nice in
person you're so sweet it's like anyone
who's ever said but there's like a
filter on that no I actually don't
use I believe it I don't but no one
should claim that you do right right
right
I'm a foot from it I'm not even if she
sees things you see my moustache - I see
no mustache I can't wait to see what you
think at the end of it I don't think
you're gonna be happy about it I know I
don't know why I didn't take up singing
but can I make them my ringtone
um absolutely so yeah I guess we'll jump
right into okay so one thing I just went
personally fine on a hot topic calm it
was foundation and concealer which I'm
not shocked no I couldn't find any how
about she makes me look real tan and I
have a tan right now
we had trouble exposing for the both of
us I think I'm a minimalist at heart you
are how do you know I can tell I can
come to your desk and I know your mo cuz
it's just like yes it's just like
essentials and mine literally has
everything under that Sun yes I'm
putting shaped a pole over my face I'm
just putting
hours over my face my neck is a lot of
colors okay I'm gonna try out Lisa Frank
which is so cute did you love Lisa Frank
or not yes okay
never ever Keepers okay that's like the
big folder the Zips and then you open it
has the stickers and all the papers and
folders inside it's like a big binder
what kind of binder oh yeah like oh yeah
yeah like mega well Lisa Frank always
made Trapper Keepers ditch I don't hate
it and it's nice and matte so it's
actually a contour so I mean okay listen
Frank I see you I want to try that after
you have some curious if it would be too
dark on me or not I'm not gonna lie I
would like to see a little bit more I
shadow palette oh yeah why would I be
where's that at and they put out a
bronzer shadow it doesn't make sense the
worst is when you have a pimple right
where you need to contour because then
it's impossible to cover it the bronze
actually like it looks pretty good it
doesn't really nice it's not as cool as
it looks in the in the pot ha I know it
kind of warmed up on especially on my
temples when I found a pretty blush
which I'm going to try out by Jay Katz
it's kind of Lars a cat person as you
know and she's a puppy love I'm a dog
person this is so pigmented oh wow have
fun we got to be careful with her the
blush is very pick oh my gosh it's
actually gorgeous Oh super shimmery
those if you had a lot of texture I'd be
very careful but shimmer is really
pretty in a blush I swear the beauty
guru
Ripley knew I was a cat person as soon
as they walk in she's kind of like a cat
herself though she is I see that she'll
walk on the backs of couches and that's
very cat-like yeah she'll she'll hit
things off of places just to spite
excuse me oh yes yeah I just did a video
in the early 2000s and I was thinking
about how did you do this back in like
2004 or 5 in order to make yourself tan
you just covered your face and bronzer
absolutely what are we waiting my
specifics I like to shimmery bronze or -
not a matte all over your face yeah no
it's not blending out on me
as well as if I'm some matte powder on
top okay so tell me how you got your
like what made you get into
special-effects makeup
did you always just love it in general
um I was kind of a creepy kid surprise
shocking yeah it was the kind of kid
that was watching The Exorcist by age 11
by myself yeah I was I was just a creepy
kid and loved it naturally well and my
birthday is the day after Halloween so I
got real into Halloween every year which
meant that I wanted to be creepy not
cute I love no no I'm self-taught no
well I mean I learned things through
jobs that I took to I'm taking this
bronzer by the way guys I use as a
transition because I'm really debating
what color I should use they've given me
a lot of really beautiful colors so I
feel like if I put gold on my audience
will slap me oh this is fun and I'm like
I'll go with the gold
can I pick for you yes you can the
purple and the blue alright and I'm
doing it you're doing good not too bad I
love Lady pigments yeah I'm pretty
impressed I want to try this palette

interstellar it looks very pretty it
looks like candy I'm not bad at it I'll
tell you that tell me what to do
I want this in these that's the purple
and blue yeah wait a minute Ramiz are
all shimmering so you're gonna have to
do see I have these are too so I except
for at one Matt but I had to use Lisa
Frank where did you learn how to do

just loved it so much I even found out
rocking glitz eyeliner which I was
surprised but excited about Oh on there

okay I don't know Shh
Oh black shimmer oh boy okay this
eyeliner is fabulous is my J cat so you
guys know I mean I don't know how it's
gonna in like this shine on it but we'll
see so do you like horror movies I do
though only ones that scare me are the
ones where things could really happen
like demons and Exorcist which scared me
this is so bad to the point where I
almost couldn't finish the movie really
I like more realistic movies but they
don't scare me
super Halloween as a kid I was a black
cat for like six years horse you worried
what's one of your favorite Halloween
costumes it's my favorite costume is one
that I turned into a tutorial eventually
the pre and post-op plastic surgery
Barbie love that one that's one of my
favs too this year I was Beetlejuice
that's right oh yes I saw you you looked
fantastic my makeshift Beetlejuice but
I'm a really big fan of the Beetlejuice
movie and the gag is I didn't know that
the Halloween party was at the
Beetlejuice house oh yeah you remember
oh yeah and I showed up and I was like
I'm like you don't we're I don't work
you yeah exactly I was like this is so
awkward because everybody's dressed up
like a Beetlejuice character as the
workers here I come storming oh I
remember
because Beetlejuice the Beetlejuice that
was there like hired to be the
beetlejuice yep was so creepy and
obnoxious just like in the movie yes so
guys I got these two lip glosses and one
alien heads from Blackheart you're
talking about the brand we have a theme
going on pack jinx fascinating and the
other is Marvel infinity so I'm not
gonna lie like this component is nice
