but you're caught it cuz I'm faster than
you she put it she put no her port
stinks hey guys what's up welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be a
full face of makeup ads that's right
sponsored content from Facebook on to my
face this video took me a really long
time to put together like a month at
least gave me a really long time to put
together because I couldn't find enough
ads for a full face of makeup so I just
had a wait and everynight scroll through
Facebook which is an app that I really
don't even use anymore
this is also inspired by a Sofia Nygaard
video she did this video first I believe
we're shooting full face of makeup ads
now Wow going into this video I thought
it was in general what people were
advertising on Facebook but in her video
she was doing specifically what they
were advertising for her so that's what
took me so long I had to wait for ads to
come up the more ad you click on that
our makeup and buy something the more ad
you get but I still just honestly for
months getting the same thing over and
over and over again and it was getting
really annoying and I started to give up
on the video but finally I got some good
stuff basically we're doing makeup on
what Facebook thinks I should be wearing
here and what I should be spending my
dollars on Facebook has become a very
interesting part of the internet my day
how do you guys have been asking where
I've got my new bracelet and rings from
that I always wear I'll have it all
linked down below I got it from an
sister on she's really amazing has all
good stuff
but I won't link it down below for you
guys to check out it's real party and my
second announcement is that my morphe
brush set will be back in stock on 5:30
so make sure max
mark your calendars for 5:30 if you want
to question all right that's all the
announcements I have other than my oh
girl she wouldn't be lonely if that
track one showing I will just put that
back in there pretend it's all my hair
let's sing the subscribe song and I'll
jump right into the video right here and
wearing
now let's get started okay the first ad
that I got was for a cup re have you
guys heard of this brand there at
Sephora I believe and this was the whole
kit that they were advertising so I
bought the whole kit but it has body
glow it has all today I'm just because
we're doing a full face of makeup not so
much like the coconut bomb I want to put
some this coconut sheer silicone free o
on my face and use it kind of like a
primer and just anyone help him oh it
looks chunky and gross so that is on my
face feels very soft a little bit heavy
but I shall pay the next thing I
actually got an ad for is the brand new
Becca this is the ultimate coverage girl
24-hour wear Foundation y'all I'm
excited to try this out because I have a
pretty good local Becca products but
24-hour wear who is wearing your makeup
for 24 hours girl I want to hear some
stories feed me some stuff in the
comment section because the thing is
like if I have fallen asleep in my
makeup and I'm wondering for 24 hours
like I did in high school I'm not gonna
get up and be like oh I still looks good
let me just go back to school with it
like what No wash your face it was like
these claims these extreme claims on
makeup I have the shade tan here because
I think I'm tan and I'm gonna just oh
there's a little bit tan oh man I picked
the wrong shade okay what about the
shade of olive let me try that yeah all
of it is much better
great so one half of my face would be
tan one happily olive oh honey this
coverage though they were not lying
ultimate coverage is right I'm having
some luck here tonight baby I do like it
thank you face book you did a good job
with that one okay next from face book
I got an ad for the milk cosmetics
concealer I have the shame shame light I
like the two
it comes out on a wine the happiest this
before and I already had it so when I
saw an ad for it I was like when but I
did click the end because I want it the
clicks to advertise me more makeup so
that's kind of like what I was trying to
do honestly I never use Facebook anymore
and I was so sick of looking at so I'm
just gonna blend that out with this red
little sponge from morphe can also use
your handy dandy white six brush if you
have it on deck this concealer is really
pretty I'm having a lot of luck with
complexion products to be honest like
Facebook ads have to work because so
many brands had ads like really big
brands and I feel like they wouldn't be
spending their money on advertisement
there but didn't work though I got a lot
of advertisements for this store called
Beauty Bridge it says it has over 8,000
brands and I've never heard of the store
at my life we're finishing powders had
smashbox of dermablend or mineral so a
couple different brands they sell
finishing powders for i don't want to
use typical makeup so I don't use these
bare mineral ones too often so I want to
try them out and just set my face makeup
with them this foundation looks really
beautiful from Becca so I am quite
impressed now I'm gonna have to set my
under eyes with this because I ain't got
nothing else to set my under eye I'm
like there's no Laura Mercier ads right
now for their finishing powder no cover
FX where are those finish the face but
I'm really excited because I want to get
into these palettes Pat McGrath heavily
advertised every single time I was like
her makeup advertisement these little
pallets will come up both of them so I
bought both of them they're quite pricey
little nuggets as most of Pat McGrath
makeup is so there was not really a
shock of there or wasn't like I chose a
really good quality they're just
expensive as hell I'm gonna put on
shadow shields today I look like a Star
Trek character first shade I'm gonna go
in with this is hot pink shade so I'm
gonna use this of my crease and you may
be like Laura this is not what you
typically do Babu but I don't know I'm
just like trying something else well
there seems to be more of a satiny
next up I'm gonna take some of that
purple I'm gonna pack on this purple
onto the outer corner but I'm also gonna
work it in the crease a little bit my
boobs are so full of saying right now I
want to claw my nipples off
I went to the beach earlier today and I
changed my bottoms but I haven't changed
my top and I know my tops still full of
sand which is super exciting it'll go
back in with my r39 brush and give that
like a soft little blend I'm pretty sure
I'm dumping a sand castle out of my
chest right now great right now I'm
gonna add some concealer on to the lead
guys know I love doing this holy crap
adds so much purple fall out on my nose
I'm gonna tap into this in gold shade
and I'm just gonna pack it on top of
only where I put the concealer
there's gold - it's really pretty
because I am dealing with a bit of
Fallout I did just add a little bit of
setting spray which normally it takes
care of that so easily
I feel like this I look looks extremely
sickening and I'm excited about it oh
wow we're gonna blend it away
so why sixes are four but they're gonna
add a little more powder for the lower
lash line I'm gonna go back in with our
gorgeous purple color and then just kind
of blend that out a little because it's
a little bit harsh mascara actually to
adds and I love both of these mascara
this is some milk makeup push mascara
and then this is the Marc Jacobs velvet
noir and I think they're both great so
I'm just gonna do one on one eye and
then on the other eye on one
believe it or not boxycharm was actually
an add on this thing and it was cardi B
opening her box each time and it was
literally an ad and so I have my box
each I'm here oh my gosh we got to
makeup brushes we got like a big kabuki
or a big powder brush and then an
eyeliner brush and we got some cover FX
blurring primer yeah a lip product and
we got my favorite eyeliner ever which
is the pretty vulgar the ink black gel
liner I love this stuff I'm actually
gonna use the liner brush that came in
the box each arm I'm gonna use this
little fully brush that come in the box
each arm or this mascara right away to
face advertise the hook out of their
natural collection it's all I saw for a
week I'm pretty sure so I'm going to use
the bronzer and blush out of here and
Sela constable I'm gonna take my e4
brush and contour a little bit this
palette like so the bronzer just got my
mouth and it literally tastes good I
love this collection from Too Faced it's
so nice they did such an amazing job
with it I'm gonna go in with another
clean before and just mix these two
blushes together
anytime I put on too much I take my
diamond blender and just like dab at all
and honestly it helps or highlighter she
way was advertising and there skinny-dip
highlighter with the skinny-dip lip
topper so oh my god anyone broke my nail
off oh my go ahead and apply this this
Kitty tip highlighter is like honey
alright I can't go what girl wait
I'm actually gonna go in with like a
touch of that hot pink shade and dusty
on the lower lashline or lips
I got an advertisement for the Finn T
Mademoiselle and since my eye look is so
intense I'm gonna go in with a little
bit of this lighter shade which is
called single I'm just gonna add a
little bit of it and like I said they
were advertising the G way lip topper
and skinny dip with the highlight which
is so blinding so I'm just gonna put
some of it on alright guys this is my
finish look what do you guys think I
think the eyes are like blow me away
beautiful like huh I think everything
just turned out so pretty and this isn't
typical makeup that I would go for and
use this isn't a typical look for me but
I think the lip doesn't match perfectly
but I think it looks pretty good and
everything else looks really amazing so

advertisement because girl we really
turned it out on this one okay and I
love the foundation so much like I'm
definitely gonna be wearing this
