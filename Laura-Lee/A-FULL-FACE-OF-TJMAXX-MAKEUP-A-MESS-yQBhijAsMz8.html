not a ASMR are you look closer
okay nothing like a layer sick hey guys
what's up welcome to my channel one
person commented last week don't think I
only seen these comments but girl I see
you comment last week I just thumbs down
this video because she said okay so okay
what are you thumbs up or thumbs down
the video YouTube creates it as equal
integration so now you just feeding the
beast days video is going to be on a
cool face of me going to TJ Maxx and
trying to get a full face and makeup
down the path I have done what I found
at t.j.maxx meaning I went in the store
I shopped around and try to find really
nice high-end brands at really
discounted price and basically seen how
good I could get and I came back and did
a haul video with it today's videos
gonna be a little bit different because
I'm going to be doing my full face of
makeup with it and basically my goal was
not just to buy makeup but tried to
strategically find a full face meaning
like a primer concealer foundation
everything all this but innocence of
clearance makeup because t.j.maxx makeup
is makeup on discount clearance makeup
so it's like my clearance makeup series
on going but onward to t.j.maxx so I
went there and I got a bunch of stuff
but let me tell you this for some reason
this time I was like let me go to a
different TJ Maxx do the same one that I
always go to to see if I can get more
product but it was actually way worse
and way more challenging and my husband
literally had to help me oh I cannot
guarantee you guys an amazing makeup
look in today's video but you will bear
with me and we will get through it
together so what I'm gonna do now is
sing the SUBSCRIBE song
let's jump right in and get started I
need some deodorant my armpits are
sticky
yeah I'm inserting I'm leaving well I
found these a velvet matte lipstick next
and then this is like to make it that
they have so they do have a name brand a
purple would be so they do have like
this eyeliner I'm trying to look for a
makeup as well so we can kind of like
see what's on sale see what good finds a
disc and penetrate this camera right
this blue highlighter but a t.j.maxx
from my past videos that's normally the
case still that's so rude I'm stealing
 it's rude
I just found some Smashbox it looks like
a primer for my eyelids
oh I'm diggin honey I am nothing
oh it's it's been swatched it's watched
testing the tester but this is not gonna
be my shade you know you should do a
full face of makeup em TJ Maxx you guys
watch my last haul a lot of the makeup
had been open and used and I was like
huh we played me shoot me go I opened it
and checked it myself um some pieces I
got makeup of stuff I never heard of
like a lunar Beauty okay so for primer I
have found actually this mascara kit you
get a mascara primer the full-size
mascara and then you get a little oh
this is an eye primer gosh this was a
face primer this is my first time doing
makeup I'm sorry it is the foundation
primer came in the bareMinerals box so
this is a four piece starter set i got
her 1699 it was originally 25 bucks it
looks like a clear gel and i'm just
going to rub this feels like varies very
silicone me kind of feels heavy I'm not
gonna lie so what's interesting for
foundation I literally could not find a
foundation anywhere and I started to
panic so my husband actually found this
elf foundation palette and I didn't want
to use just a powder foundation like I
wanted the real thing but then we opened
it and we saw it's a cream foundation so
we're gonna test it out with none other
than it's hard to open then the y6 for
more bc it was six feet the y6 from more
cased like a flat top kabuki and i think
i'm going
I don't know I'm just gonna try this
shade this is like I'm just gonna be
honest like this feels very just Greece
just pure grease on my face it's like
turning super shiny and the palate let
me be real in this moment now I love a
lot of elf makeup let me start by saying
that and I like affordable makeup and a
lot of guys do you guys know that about
me but this feels like hell on my face
and I hate it so much
so I think that their serum foundation
is a better option than this palette
even just putting it on like there's
zero coverage nothing's being covered
but my face feels wet with grease so
right now I'm gonna stop complaining and
move on I found a still a concealer for
$5.99 that was originally ten bucks and
it's shade medium the aqua glow serum it
comes in this little tube right here oh
look at that interesting I dampened a
contour sponge from morphe and I'm gonna
put the concealer on the sponge which it
does have some coverage it feels pretty
wet but it does have some coverage the
concealer is doing me pretty good so far
hopefully it's not too Creasy I would
have typically gone with a shade light
but they didn't have it they only had
shade medium so here we are with shade
medium a marker because we didn't get a
lot of coverage from the foundation I'm
just gonna Pat this around just a bit to
build up a little bit of additional
coverage one of the only powders I could
find was this covergirl powder clean so
I'm just gonna set my face with this I
got it for $2.99 which is really
affordable and I got it in the shade
medium life I'm gonna take my handy
dandy y11 brush and just swig it around
in here oh my gosh it's just like
turning so pink can you guys tell like
how pink that's turning I told you guys
I saw the makeup I was getting and I was
literally like oh this could not end
well but on a positive note we're just
keep the party moving and try to do the
best we can with what we have like this
does not look right oh my god why is it
turning out so crazy so I got this
bareMinerals bill that came with the kit
that had the primer in it it has not
been opened
it looks pretty like it could be bronzy
no no not bronzy okay oh because I
didn't know if that would work out I
went ahead and bought a backup which I
bought this Mac Studio bronzer blush and
highlight kit for 399 it was originally
5 bucks it's like one of those little
holiday kids that you get her all let me
open it like it's Christmas oh but you
actually get a little brush with it too
so that's I'm just gonna tap into the
bronzer which lots of excess powder but
this is way more bronzer esque not that
we really need much bronzer because
let's be real I'm starting to look like
a Cheeto it's just like right here she's
real looking cheeto esque I'm gonna use
the brush that came in it to apply a
little bit of blush actually this brush
is a bit of a stiff flop my efore brush
which the blush actually goes on pretty
soft and smooth yeah it's got like a
load of pigment to the blush like almost
I think cuz I put on way too much that's
just nice from this so let's swatch the
highlight before we go directly to face
Oh kinda looks a little pewter II gray
but we're just adding a touch of it yeah
like not adding too much yeah so you get
that great film but it is blinding like
really wanting so I definitely give that
to them but you just gotta use just a
tiny amount like that so I just put on
too much so what I like to do when I put
on too much is just touch it up
no hard okay the highlight I like the
best
I'm just gotta use it sparingly it's
really pretty all right we have a win
like this palette I really paid a couple
bucks for and I mean I don't love love
the bronzer but the highlight blush is
great I got this Pirates of the
Caribbean palette from lorac and I paid
20 bucks for it and it was originally a
13 I didn't realized the palette had a
little liner in it but I really liked
the colors in here oh I knew it had a
drawer because the palette was so thick
but the drawer is empty so it appears
I've been robbed
I'm calling the police and just for
safety I went ahead and picked up this
wanderlust palette from cargo it looks
like it has seen better days and the
colors are just so great they remind me
of a gray sad day outside the packaging
is kind of cute now for this actually
mattefy what I paid let me tell you paid
$9.99 for this palette and it was
originally $15 I'm gonna do pirates
chest as the first color and I went
ahead actually and put down the little
Smashbox primer as my eyelid primer that
came in the little mascara box so here
we go here we give the last look on my
channel I used 14 different shades
because the challenge was to use every
shade and shadow palette and it was very
difficult so in today's video I plan on
not being so crazy and limiting down my
color usage I want to do tell no tales
which is like this ma vie hello getting
focus ma be purpley shade and I'm using
our 39 brush so what I'm gonna do is
like pack that on I'm just gonna blend
it from inner to outer corner do I ever
wear colors that are this like cool tone
and like grayish absolutely not
but I am today because some of you guys
have requested it and you know I'm into
neutrals I've been doing colorful colors
but I have avoided these type of colors
like the plague because I just
I don't know something about them
doesn't make me like and I like using
things that make me go kind of planted
that all the way from inner to outer
corner and then the crease and all over
now what I want to do is take this like
do a chrome black pearl color it's like
pearlescent show you guys this swatch
it's pretty cool really just with my
finger I'm just gonna pack this color
all over I actually take a brush and get
into this inner corner so it doesn't
explode everywhere oh great just lightly
press it on its color I like a lot of
pigment to it I think it looks really
pretty and now I'm gonna go back in with
our 39 and just soften up the edges cuz
it does need a bit more blending I'm
gonna take some a ghostly which is the
white shade it's like a satin it's kind
of a shimmery matte white shade and then
I'm gonna put that on the inner corner
I'm also just gonna like put a tiny bit
of that color that white right on my
brow bone cuz I've been doing winged
liner like so much I decided I'm not
gonna do wing liner today but I am gonna
line just the lash line that way
whenever I put on lashes like there's
not a big difference or a gap so it came
with this lorac eyeliner and I've always
had good luck with the rock eyeliners
and so I'm just that's just girl that's
just what I'm gonna use today that also
defines the eyes a little more so I'm
gonna go back to this little kit from
Smashbox which did I tell you the price
it was 23 bucks I got it for $14.99 and
I'm gonna use the mascara and then we're
gonna put on our bus Scarah this one is
huge honey
lashes I think I'm gonna have to double
stack but we'll see what happens I got
these little lashes for days they looked
very wispy for 789 they were originally
in 14 bucks and I chose these that a ton
of like multi pack lashes but I chose
these because some of their multi pack
lashes look so like foamy and just like
three big clumps so I like these because
they just had like this more wispy
effect to them so that is our lash
double stacked too shabby because the
lashes are so wispy and like thin I'm
having a little bit of trouble with my
real lashes like sticking to them but
it's just taking a little bit of time in
finagling they go back in with our Mavi
matte color and with the e34 pencil
brush I'm going to just I need a mirror
I'm just new mirror I'm gonna buff this
on the lower lash line I'm gonna go back
in with this little the rock eyeliner
and just hit the waterline with it I
just need to know how people make pretty
or even remotely pretty faces whenever
they're putting on eyeliner a mic for my
lips I could not believe what I found
about actually one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks from honest Tashia for $7.99
and it is the liquid lipstick naked
I'm hello I was like I found this velvet
matte lipstick trio for $4.99 that was
originally a $7 from NYX and I got this
dolce &amp;amp; gabbana
passion duo for $20 cute like shimmery
lippy which I don't think it's gonna be
our color for this dark look since our
eyes are so dark I'm obviously gonna go
with it naked from honest - yeah
okay guys this is the final look what do
you guys think I'm gonna be honest I
really like the eyeshadow palette I like
the lippy I like the double stock lashes
the mascara was great the things I found
the most problems were was the face
makeup the bronzer the face powder and
the concealer and foundation we're just
kind of like oh let me spritz my face
girl that smells so good oh my gosh this
smells like perfume
okay it was just honestly as far as the
face powder it was just the coloring was
off and it was very very very matte
foundation which is grease that primer
was very heavy the concealer it was
greasy and Creasy I probably wouldn't
use it again the blush I like the
highlight I liked and the bronzer I
think just wasn't like my shade and I
just wasn't having to look with it I
don't think it was a no we're all bad
bronzer I think it just went for me but
yeah but like overall like with the
discount makeup I think the look is it
horrible I think the eyes look gorgeous
I think the lips look gorgeous and the
face could use just a little touch-up
but other than that I think we did the
best we could with what we had so give
