channel today's video is going to be on
the subculture palette by Anastasia
Beverly Hills and I also got some of her
new lipsticks in the liquid glow
highlights that I'm going to be testing
out there has just been so much back and
forth on this palette on Twitter however
I found Twitter just to be a negative
mess all together so I'm kind of like
hmm
it's like Twitter's like its own source
of negativity and then you go into the
rest of the world and it's not so bad
just seeing people talk about the
fallout and I also seen a lot of the
Jeffrey saut androgyny comparison with
this one which I will be doing today as
well as testing the fallout I bought
this one myself it wasn't sent to me and
I haven't touched it yet although I've
looked at like 10 times because I think
it's a really pretty palette so that's
what I got for you guys today also I
just really quickly want to mention a
huge success on the merch and I just
want to thank you guys so much and
everybody they got a piece of merch for
sure and hashtag lolly Los Angeles
because I want to see you rocking it and
we wanted to shine up on the lolly Los
Angeles Instagram page I'm so excited
about and you guys killed it we sold out
of all of our first order we dipped into
our second order we're still sold out of
a bunch of sizes and a couple of shirts
that I have already wins the day and
launched and did a restock on all of
that so thank you guys so the ball in my
heart for all that support and love it
means so much and I also listen to all
of your advice on pieces that you want
to add to the collection more sizes and
things like that
so I ordered and we're working on some
gimmicky stuff number but anyways
without further ado be sure and we'll go
ahead and jump right into the video okay
I'm pretty excited about this video most
of the things I think is a beautiful
palette it is kind of like the modern
Renaissance it has like the velvety
texture on it and then it says
subculture I'm the wrong snapchat was
talking about and ever I was like girls
I called it the structure pelvic
sometimes I just have brain farts
because I'm a human being and that's
what happened anyway so it's subculture
and it comes with 14 shapes and it comes
with a brush I'm going to go ahead and
let you know I love the brushes that
come in the on associate Beverly Hills
Kalas I think they are amazing and
that's rare for me because most brushes
that come in on chef pallets and just
like I will never use fresh but these
brushes I always end up using I've had
food qoodles vana Sasha Beverly Hills
palates and I like them I really like
for quality so the tea on Twitter is
going around with the extreme extreme
fall out such as people tapping the pans
and color is just blowing everywhere I
don't personally like that and eyeshadow
palette and it kind of would deter me
from buying a palette if it had that
much fallout and much blow out because I
feel like you're wasting a lot of
product but to be honest if I palette is
too stiff and the colors are pressed too
hard and I can't get any eyeshadow that
also would deter me from buying the
palette because I feel like you don't
get the payoff because it's just pressed
too hard in the pan
and you've got to dig through shadow so
you really get that color payoff and
then I feel you're kind of wasting
product there too by scraping to get to
the bottom of the pan so I like a good
in-between I love a little fill out when
I tap it and a little bit of color comes
off I'm like yes girl you know you gotta
get that good in between let's do that
first and then I have the androgyny
problem here and we're going to compare
a couple of the shades to see the T on
that I think it's pretty fair for me to
try both into the brush that came into
the palette so let's go ahead and get
really close before I tap into the
palette here is a close-up of it so you
guys can see the shades 14 shades right
here really unique colors that we're
putting this palette together so I have
the brush that came with it
I'm going to use some more dense short
in and I'm going to go ahead and tap
into all stars I believe this is one of
the shades they were saying getting off
some of my brush all right I mean I
gotta say there there is some fallout
there's some pretty major fallout but
that was one brush so let's try the
fluffy brush maybe that one shade right
here NuWave oh guys just I'm lightly
tapping real like oh wow look at that do
you guys see that
okay so I don't think people are being
dramatic or silly about this at all and
I'm using her very own brush and I
promise you I am just as you can see
just barely tapping on it I would tap
harder if I was going to get my
eyeshadow on this guy's since that brush
is dirty now we're going to go ahead and
tap a little bit into this one yeah me
not quite as much but there's a lot
there's a lot of fallout can't see that
right there
all right there let's do rowdy little
tap I'm selling some salt out people
what do you guys think down in the
comment section I'm being pretty gentle
about her tap tap tap and then my brush
is exploding the color alright so now
we're going to try the shimmer and we're
going to see if they have that much fun
as well I seriously doubt the shimmers
are yeah the shimmer is like don't have
any fallout like it's creamy you're
picking up a lot of product on your
brush no fallout their electric seeing
another shimmering one just even going
back and forth little specks our glitter
may be coming off but we're not dealing
and look how much pigment we picked up
good bit creamy we're not dealing fill
up so it's the maps that we're talking
about here alright moving on with the
video so next let's compare a lot of
times people saying that the same colors
are in the androgyny palette that are in
this palette now I just want to talk
about in georgg for a minute and I think
Jeffrey's palettes in general he tends
to come up with shades that people don't
see hardly ever and you will most never
see these shades in I should apologize
rule shades out of his ass I don't even
know he like creates them in his mind
now you know goals in neutral colors
like that you can't say oh he just
created out of his mind you know but
then there's some colors like these is
just like who puts these in a palette
together it's just so unique his work
and I think that that is what his whole
cosmetics line is known for so then
whenever people saw this palette come
out I think they start to see some of
the same moments happening but in one
palette so then I think that led to a
lot of questioning so I'll do some
side-by-side swatches just looking at
the pal
it if I already have and joj me I would
not buy this palette because I do
already feel like it's so much of the
same stuff that it would kind of be
pointless and how many of the unique
shades do you need in one eyeshadow
palette now I can take a hundred goals
and light colors like this all day long
but like the unique shades you know I'm
not going to buy a hundred palettes with
unique shades in it with the same unique
shades which I guess doesn't make it
unique anymore I would more so by you
know 100 warm tone palettes or something
like that it you know I don't know
that's just my thoughts on it and the
way I'm looking at this situation so
let's watch new wave and charm which
honestly people see a very big roots
inland they're a little bit different
but they are similar so there you have
that we're going to do access and poison
which was a big question and they're not
identical but they are incredibly
similar colors and I think these are
both unique I shadow colors to put in a
palette I will say rowdy which is the
darker one and androgyny which is the
lighter one are a good bit different but
they're both plummy purples but they are
different next we have all star and
fetish and what I'm realizing is all
star looks just like androgynous and
actually let me switch those two right
beside each other so here's all star in
and ROG theme they're not the same but
they're similar
next we have destiny and military and
again they're not the same but it's kind
of like that um deep matte green color
that you have so as you just see it's
definitely not a ripoff palette but the
colors are similar and I think what the
big fuss was about is that Jeffrey is so
unique with his eyeshadow creations and
what he puts together in a palette and
just to see another palette come out
after his that you know had these unique
shades there that are very similar kind
of had people poking around I mean like
so just in my opinion like if I already
have in George me I probably would
invite a subculture palette just because
like I said before she's got too many of
the same shades like the same setup of a
very unique palette do you get what I'm
saying I hope that makes sense anyways
you guys can make your own decision I
feel like if compared them enough so now
we're going to move on and I'm going to
do an eye look with this subculture
bullet let me say one more thing before
we jump into the tutorial on this
I just want to say that the Sephora
collection Pro palette had this much if
not more fallout as a subculture palette
very similar fallout is not more and
there wasn't that big of a fuss but
because it was on especially Beverly
Hills and I don't know if it's because
her brand has such good quality people
are upset but I just didn't see as big
as a fuss and I felt like the pro
palette room was worse than this so it
was just like why are very exciting
about this talisman of Protoss visiting
and it could be because she has such
good quality all the time people are
just shocked that developed would have
this much fallout I did San Twitter nor
Vina saying that customer service would
take care of you over you're unhappy
with the palette and you don't like the
fallout or you feel like there's
something wrong with it they would
return replace and I feel like that is
the right thing to do and as long as
they're taking care of their customers
and that's alright great there was like
a piece of I don't know what that is on
my lips the whole time that you guys are
staring at great so far I haven't crema
eyelids oh my god I'm going to go ahead
and pry my eyelids with my Mac Paint Pot
this is soft ochre I use this every day
and I do a really colorful look the
difficult thing with being on YouTube I
know a lot of you guys viewing aren't
necessarily a YouTube or you're not
putting out content in multiple times a
week but it gets really difficult
sometimes when people are like you never
use color you do the same look in my
last video I try to use purple but it
just wasn't good enough so that sucks
sometimes and today I'm going to do a
really colorful look but then it's just
a double-edged sword because I see the
comments you I can't wear this can you
do an everyday look so I can actually
use the palette so I just feel like I'm
stuck in between a rock and a hard place
sometimes and I know I can never make
everyone happy so I need to stop trying
but for those of you who don't put up
content multiple times a week just
understand that I'm only one human and I
try to make the majority of you guys
happy and I can't possibly make
everybody happy but just so I try but
today we'll be doing a colorful look
with it and as you guys know if you're
looking for more neutral everyday look
I'll have another one those videos
coming soon
but first I am going to go in with a
neutral shade I'm going to say dawn for
just a transition into a soften of the
eyeshadow primer I'm going to use the m5
girlfriend that's unreal
anyways my knees anti 7/3 brush the
payoff is extreme looking at just one
little baby slide I actually need to
take this to draw look that is some
major color payoff so let's let's apply
that for a second like that's awesome I
guess they just changed up how they're
pressing their shadows and they just
wanted to have that real moment with
this palette but really I think people
just weren't used to on associate
shadows being like that whenever they
got the palette they were just like girl
I'm gonna take a dirty r39 brush the
color isn't coming off anymore the brush
is just super dirty in in any Kleenex
I'm going to take Roxy which is a peach
color again just just so I'm updating
you still having some fallout issue with
any matte shade but I'm going to take
Roxy and as you can tell I'm not really
putting it down here on the lid I'm
trying to focus it more so in the crease
I put it on the back side of my brush
then I flip my brush if you get some on
the lid that's absolutely okay and I
kind of like buff the majority at the
color right here on the outer corner and
then whenever there's not so much color
left on the brush I'll start to bring it
on around these shades are extremely
pigmented so you don't need a lot of
product and I recommend just going in
with a light hand with your palette as
you can see I'm just buff in that outer
corner and then I'll just take the rest
and kind of with this same brush I'm
going to grab some untain and I'm going
to keep this color a little bit lower we
do that payoff though
taking and tamed I'm really just
focusing it on an outer corner there's
literally so much pigment it's unreal
and I'm just really trying not to take
it in all the way next I'm going to grab
some of the shade access which is this
really bright blue color I feel like we
should get a smaller brush because girl
miss me I start off with this random
pencil brush and tap them on it and I'm
going to add it right at our corner as
well
I'm going to take that our 39 brush and
now that I've added the color on I'm
just going to softly smooth it out
well so I initially wanted to kind of
keep the color on the outer corner right
here
but it was so freakin pigmented the more
I like softly blended it for like the
color just moved forward so guess what
we're doing a blue eye today and that's
apparently going to be really pretty but
I'll just shine let you guys know my
initial thoughts on what I was trying to
do and like how worked out these colors
are almost so pigmented they're almost a
little bit difficult to work with just
because like you get an extreme payoff I
know someone's going to reach through
the cameras slap me for saying
something's too pigmented and le it's
too pigment Tim just saying I'm over
here creating looks I didn't know what
was creating because of the pigment oh
we have blue eyes and now what I'm going
to do is take that brush we first used
in 5 7 3 and just soften up the outer
edges buffing them I'm going really
light handed with the brush making sure
we don't move too much color around so I
had a lot of blue fallout in my inner
corner right here like it's just so dark
and blue and so I had to pick a wipey
and clean that up it was kind of
becoming a mess this blue honestly this
is how much blue I walked out in my
inner corners it's just it's all over my
hands I feel like it's just a freaking
mess right now I'm getting a little bit
frustrated we're going to add a lot of
powder so that way I can catch any more
fell out and we can just sweep it away
this time
good girl she's struggling a little bit
with this balloon well alright I'm gonna
take all star and I'm going to sleep it
on the oh my gosh that pigmentation well
she's going to sleep it on that lower
lashline and make these to connect right
here at the end and bump uglies how
about blue on my mustache it's just
everywhere now I'm just kind of softly
buffing that in that outer corner there
so everything flow I'm going to take a
little bit of adorn which is the bronzy
color the palette I'm going to apply
just a little bit to this center of the
lid I still like the look is just so
plain and Matt and needs like a little
judge will spotlight moment
put the gravity 17 brush and just soften
up those edges of the gold bronzy yellow
every time I touch this blue color
Altmann I get a little shaky cuz I'm
like oh my god
everywhere it's all over my pants all
over my desk it's on all my brushes it's
all over my hands I have to keep wiping
over the makeup wipes it's like a lot of
pigment now I'm going to pop on some
false lashes and I'll be right I'm
actually going to be a little bit fun
and oh my god full Sun oh yeah thank you
okay these are the mills makeup stands
and I love them so cute I'm gonna take a
little bit this Urban Decay cranberry
plummy liner pencil and just do the one
on line with it
no she's going to make the face you know
I gotta make the face and here is our
eye look so now I'm going to try out the
liquid go low so we have two colors that
I bought about Perla and oyster they
come in squeezy tubes which I like I
like to squeeze these usually think
they're just like a cute clean way to
apply them here are both of the colors
so launched so I think they are really
pretty they aren't as pigmented as you
can see a little bit more sheer whenever
you blend them out and aren't quite as
pigmented as the coverfx line but I know
not everybody wants at home just when
you see what it is what it is and then
you can decide on your own if it you
think it student worth it but they're
really pretty so I'm going to apply a
little bit to the cheeks I'm going to
try on the pearl one that is the
prettiest one to me out of the two I'm
just going to the blender oh that's
really pretty it's really pretty
we got to be careful and miss the star I
should have put the star on after the
highlight that's okay we can work around
it
alright there is the highlight I think
they're really pretty highlight and I
think they're pretty blinding okay so I
have two of the lipsticks I'm going to
try out I bought two colors where they
go so I bought a fun color and I bought
a neutral color
I bought dread and insomniac insomniac
oh it's pretty much matches our eye look
so let's try it out first I must watch
it to get her going warming up major
major color payoff huh do you guys ever
feel like Hughley warm something up it
definitely works better I'm kind of
cracking myself up here I gotta say
these are really pigmented so this is so
pigmented it's very matte and not sure
at all you see no color through it it's
really comfortable to wear the colors
bright and I know a lot of people aren't
like I hate it I hate that color the
color the fun color is for people who
want to have fun with makeup I think
it's just I think they're great quality
lipsticks alright next up I have add red
which is a pretty brown color and I'm
such a sucker for like these during the
fall time and I can't wait to try it on
my lips a girl that that payoff is
lipstick in a ball they're so creamy too
if only I knew how to not mess up my
lipstick I'm definitely going to go
ahead and order girl you better stop why
the hell does this happen great my
lipsticks full of hair right whenever I
was trying to compliment you I don't
know if I did that because I rolled it
up too far I'll have to watch the video
footage over but why does that just
break alright guys this is the final
look what did you guys think about the
palette to be completely honest after
after actually using it on my eyes and
like playing within myself I got really
annoyed with the blue colors because
they were just everywhere they were all
in my fingernails they were all over my
fingers I looked down all over my pants
because the fall just exploding and the
blue is so pigmented it was just like
almost I was playing in paint and I was
a little kid it was just everywhere I
don't think I chose should really be
that messy again I feel like the support
profile is are the exact same situation
and actually honest Kashia is getting
bashed
a little bit harsh with the line whether
bashing everybody just bashes the more
popular branding as you can say but it's
what it is I don't know that I would buy
the palette honestly after dealing with
the fallout it's just so extreme it kind
of got on my nerves about the end of F
like done but I put the information out
there for you guys for you to decide for
yourself I'm obsessed with the lipsticks
I don't think the rope I'm obsessed with
the highlighters are really beautiful I
love you guys thank you for being here I
was watching after this video is gonna
be like 10 years long and I will see you
all in the next video but yes I don't
yes I though I love you you either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
