video I feel like my pizza and my team
I'm eating pizza today's video is going
to be a very affordable easy foundation
routine I get a lot of questions about
my how I do my foundation every time I
mention expensive products people always
ask for an affordable option so I
thought I would do this video oh and yes
I am wearing contacts and part of me is
absolutely in love with them the other
part of me is kind of thinking I would
like to have lizard eyes I love them I
think I love them why don't you do this
video for you guys because I'm
constantly asked for more affordable
options so here's the video for you um
and you'll get a nice flawless finish
with this in my opinion also be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
we don't want you missing out on all the
good good so hit the subscribe button
right on down below mm-hmm
drench up right in this video and get
started hi hello Here I am with no
foundation or anything like that on
first thing I like to do is hydrate my
skin because I have very dry skin if you
don't and you don't like to hydrate you
can skip this step but if you do this is
a good drunk jokes what product it's
called h2o skin drink by pixie beauty
get pixie at Target like a very
lightweight clear gel hydration for the
skin um a lot of people comment and say
hey my concealers cracking what do i do
we're creasing but a lot of that has to
do with dry under eyes you just make
sure your moisture moisturize your under
eyes you know you can do that at not
stuff smells so freakin good
just be sure and moisturize your skin
before you go to bed at night or right
before you do your makeup I do a little
bit of both
cuz yet girls got dressed wear because I
have dry skin I to use the prime
perfection by Milani this is a drugstore
primer and they also make one that is
great for pores but I'm going to use
this one because like I said I need a
little bit of hydration but this this
part could differ for everybody because
we're all so different in our skin is
different has different needs if your
skin is dry do you recommend this one if
you're having issues with pores I do
in the poor one but they're both good
affordable options so the best thing to
do with putting this most moisturizer on
your face is to wait a few minutes
before jumping into the foundation
foundation I'm going to be using is the
Milani conceal and perfect two-in-one
foundation I'm using shade oh five guys
whenever I mentioned this in my
drugstore haul so many people gave like
a bad review so they can stand it on
their skin which again we are all
different our skin does things different
our bodies do things different some of
you may hate the foundation I wore for
like a week straight and fell in love
with the foundation I think it provides
definitely it's nice full coverage but
not too cakey for me it didn't really
oxidize on my skin however I am wearing
a shade of five uhm which is pretty much
exactly my skin tone and I didn't notice
it getting crazy whenever are reacting
to the oxygen so to blend this out I'd
be using the morphe t44 brush and this
is a really nice soft foundation brush
if you're looking for an affordable
option and brushes I notice Walmart
started carrying a brand that I like
it's called mo de mo da brushes and
they're like colorful like pink and
purple and stuff so that's a good
affordable option but what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to kind of lightly
stipple this foundation all around my
face and it's just the simplicity of the
foundation you don't have to really
build it up to get that nice coverage or
you don't have to do any crazy tricks or
packing it on you just very lightly with
a light hand stipple it out and I feel
like it blends out so easy and you get
nice coverage with it this video isn't
sponsored by Milani
I'm just letting you guys know what I've
experienced with it so then whatever is
left on my hand what I like to do is
push it unto the brush and then I'll go
ahead and drag it on down the neck okay
so this foundation also have like
concealer coverage in it so what I like
to do instead of adding concealer like I
said it's going to be an easy one so
they actually just take the foundation
and I'll add extra to the under-eye
second layer I'm not really trying to
highlight my face today I'm more so just
trying to add the foundation and
coverage to it or my powder to set the
concealer and just sprinkle it all over
my face and when we using the LA girl
Pro face powder you can get this at
drugstore Calm I believe they're selling
la girl at some drugstores now as well
brushes taper so I really like to take
it to press into the under eye lines and
F 25 by seeing the beauty and I just go
like that and then I kind of apply it on
the face you can apply whatever is your
favorite facial powder I just know that
this one's a really affordable one and
it's it's really nice on the thing right
alright so that's pretty much my easy
foundation routine I will go ahead and
show you how to do my bronzer blush and
highlight with affordable products but
um as far as foundation routine you've
seen it all next up I have been
literally it's my favorite bronzer from
the drugstore this is the budget butter
bronzer from Physicians Formula I'm not
going to stay here contour my whole face
but I feel like I do need to add a
little bit of dimension or warm it up a
little bit I do add this bronzer and I
use an fo5 brush from Sigma it's just
like a perfect medium powder brush I
would just blend this stuff I'll real
face I feel like it just brings me to
life gives me a little like he's been in
the Sun a little live in her life kind
of looked now just from run it down the
nose
then at lone or blush I've been enjoying
the Oh baby pink blush by Revlon this is
a more feet five eight brush which picks
up a load of product so be careful with
it
but I just apply this to my cheeks this
blush doesn't have too much color to it
but a little bit of shimmer which gives
you a little bit of a radiant glow to
your skin and just like a touch of color
as far as my highlight since I can't
find the wedding well petal highlights
I've been using the wet and wild luma
nating at palette which looks like this
I take an e 35 brush literally go across
all of them and apply it to the places
that I like to apply highlight literally
if you do this without talking like I'm
filming a video I can do this routine in
between five and seven minutes like if
we get it go somewhere I can do this
full routine so friggin fast so I think
this is great for the morning if you
have to be at work school whatever you
got to be at in the morning life's crazy
this is a great fast routine for you we
just talked about how my nails are
busted to high heaven and they are thin
as a piece of paper because of all the
gel nails we're going to pretend they
look fabulous today okay lastly I've
been enjoying this pixie setting spray
look at the little squirter it's like so
fat I like to close my eyes take a deep
breath and enjoy my life no and then
just spray it all over my face oh it
smells so good smells like roses
come throw I really don't think you can
tell the difference if I use like a $80
foundation if we use this little honey
foundation my blush behind everything it
looks the same as high in in my personal
opinion and these products really
perform well throughout the day so this
is a great great great trust to me great
foundation routine hope you enjoyed the
video if it was helpful
I hope my hair isn't scaring you be sure
to comment down below your favorite face
product that's affordable then maybe you
know we all need to know about that we
don't know about and I love you guys so
much
