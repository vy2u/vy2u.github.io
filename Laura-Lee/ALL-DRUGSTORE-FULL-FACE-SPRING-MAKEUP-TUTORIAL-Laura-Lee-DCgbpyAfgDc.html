channel today's video is going to be an
all drugstore springtime makeup tutorial
I had done a drugstore like all drunks
are making short on a very long time so
I thought it was definitely time to do
so I do kind of give you a skill thing I
do kind of give you two options in this
video um you can leave it without the
blue on the bottom where you can add the
blue on the bottom for just a little bit
of a pop I feel like it's springtime and
I just love a little bit of color so I
did add the blue um so yeah we're gonna
tease me flaky mascara no but we're
gonna jump right in and get started but
first make sure you subscribe to my
channel I post a lot of videos on this
channel and I would love to have you as
a part of my youtube fam Jam so be sure
to subscribe before you leave we're
gonna jump right in let's do it starting
out this tutorial I've already used my
pixie h2o skin drink it looks like this
and it's just a gel to hydrate your skin
which hydrated skin typically looks the
best under any type of makeup moving on
I'm gonna do my foundation I'm using to
conceal and perfect two and one
foundation from Milani now I'm a little
bit scared to try this because it's the
first time I tried this foundation and
when I mentioned it in my drugstore haul
or my what's new at the drugstore video
so many people left a bad comment on it
and then I got on periscope and told you
guys you know scared to try it out my
first time trying it out and everybody
said on periscope that they liked it so
I don't know I didn't pry my skin I
gotta get my life together excuse me
also going to be trying out the
covergirl trublend primer for
combination skin I also heard bad
reviews on this
so I don't know what's gonna happen so I
just put the foundation on the butt of
my beauty blender and I'm just gonna
poof it around this shade looks like
it's actually going to match my skin
tone perfectly so hopefully it will
oxidize too much for those of you who
don't know oxide meet oxidize mean it
just means it reacts whenever it gets to
the oxygen in the air sometimes actually
oxidizing foundations can just change
color for the lighter not always the
darker but most the time they do turn
darker when they oxidize some solutions
don't react to the oxygen in the air for
my concealer I'm going to be using the
Masters conceal by Maybelline and I'm
going to blend that out with my Beauty
Blender I'm gonna be using my NYC smooth
setting powder that looks like this you
already know about to bake this face
like a cake I have got some questions
what does baking actually do for your
makeup and first of all it sets the
makeup setting the makeups going to make
it last longer make it not smudge help
it not to crease and it's also gonna it
can have the potential to clean up your
makeup like if you have a contour you
can bake right here and it would clean
up your contour normally let that stuff
for just a few minutes maybe like 2 or 3
minutes you let it set as long as you
think it needs to be necessary
and I'll just dust away the excess I'm
using my favorite drugstore bronzer
which is the butter bronzer by
Physicians Formula and I don't want a
contour necessarily today I feel like
it's spring time and let's just bring it
on up a little higher and warm up the
face that was just scary as far as blush
goes I'm going to be using this little
Rimmel palette and it's the O 3 and I
love this blush color and this is a
morphe e58 brush and this blush is so
pretty
for my highlight I will be using this
mega globulin from went wild I can't
find their new highlights anywhere and
I'm literally so cyan this is really
pretty so just going to use this I'm
just kind of mixing them finally we're
going to move on to the eyes tip again
I'm going to be using the next a vamp
pot or pop event palette and I really
like these next eyeshadows that come in
this palette I'm going to be taking this
nice tan color I'm using a 38 brush
which is just a blender and I'm going to
pop this onto the crease I'm going to
take it up pretty hot up pretty hard
lord have mercy when my even talking
about I'm going to take this up pretty
high because it's gonna help diffuse a
little bit of our eye primer this is
like a ten dollar elf palette I got a
long time ago it's called naked from
Target and I saw it there the other day
so I know they still make them but I'm
just going to use this middle golden
bronzy shade and I blend that right into
the crease
next up I'm mixing these two darker
shimmery colors at the end of the
palette together I'm getting just like
the smallest melon my brush and I'm just
going to pop that into the crease as
well but I'm not going to bring it up
nearly as high so I want to keep the
darker colors a little bit lower I'm
just taking this nice clean blending
brush and I'm just going to buff out the
edges to make sure they're really nicely
blended out next up I'm going to take
this single shadow from L'Oreal it's
number 207 I'm going to apply that onto
my eyelid with a flat synthetic brush
these flat synthetic brushes are great
for lid colors because they pick up the
most actual color and a product and it's
not going to fling the product
everywhere kind of like a blending brush
would Duke I'm going to go all the way
and our two outer corner back in with
that original 825 brush I'm just going
to keep the crease sharp far as my brow
bone goes I'm going to just take this
lightest shade right here a very small
amount of it because these are super
pigmented and I want to go crazy with a
light color I'm just going to pop that
right onto the brow bone just to give it
a little bit of a glow I'm going to be
adding a very thin line of liner to my
upper lash line just to define the lash
line because I'm going to be adding
lashes and I don't want there to be a
gap where you can see like my lid so
this is just some NYX liquid liner next
up is mascara this is just the Revlon
Ultra Volume Mascara I'm just going to
pep on half on top on if you go to this
stub and then we're going to add some
false legs little card you know I love
the drum
if you don't wear false lashes don't
ever feel like you need to just because
I do in the video I started wearing
false lashes and now I can't stop so if
you never wear them I don't necessarily
recommend you start because it makes me
feel like my look isn't complete just
because I see myself with them all the
time and you just kind of get addicted
to them so if you haven't started just
build up your lashes some mascara and
I'm sure your luck will turn out just
it's beautiful I'm just so used to
wearing them I pop them on all the time
I'll be using these shining star lashes
from Vegas nay they're some of my
favorite drugs for lashes and they look
kind of natural so they flicker upward
and they're not too thick so I really
like these they do come on a very long
band so it kind of gives you a lot of
option but just be sure you're not just
sticking the lash on if I did it would
come like all the way out to here you
want to custom your lashes and kind of
clip them to your eye shape so I thought
I look goes you can pop some mascara on
your bottom lashes and be done with it
I'm going to add a pop of color because
I feel like it's springtime
I want to incorporate a little bit more
color on my channel so I'm going to be
using this pretty blue color from
L'Oreal this is Grande blue number 2 1-1
I'm just a smudge on the lower lash line
I'm going to keep the color flowing with
a little bit of this la girl this is
like a blue gel liner I'm going to pop
it onto the waterline and now I'll put a
little bit of mascara to the lower
lashes
lastly to our eyes just to make the
inner corners pop I'm going to take a
little bit of this color from the elf
palette on a pencil brush and just put
it right into that inner corner for my
lips I'm going to use this NYX lip liner
pencil and natural there's a lash hair
on my face I thought it was attached
that looks like a big long mustache hair
growing OH
now I'm going in with this wet and wild
velvet matte lip color and nude streak
and I'm popped all right into the center</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
