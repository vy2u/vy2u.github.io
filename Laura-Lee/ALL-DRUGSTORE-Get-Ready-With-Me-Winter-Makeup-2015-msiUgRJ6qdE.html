would peep in and chat with you guys for
a minute I'm gonna be using the new me
at three and one which is a set that
comes with three separate wands in 1925
and a thirty two millimeter
I typically opt for the thirty two
millimeter to get those nice big fluffy
curls so also they gave me some discount
cuz I want it to go over with you guys
first it's Laura Lee Holliday and get
25% off their holiday collections and
then the second coat it's gonna be Laura
for new me and that is gonna be $89 for
any set and that gives you free shipping
as well
so what I'm doing here is just taking
sections of hair and wrapping it around
the one like a ribbon not twisting it
because I want to create curls not ways
I really like this one because it makes
my hair look nice soft and a sleek I've
super frizzy hair that doesn't like to
go together and I'm working on 2nd day
here I know you can totally tell but it
looks so good whenever we get done it
you will see so I really like this one
because it heats up nice and hot but it
won't damage your hair and it I can curl
my hair so super super quick with it so
normally let each strip set on there for
anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds and then
I squeeze the heat out and release the
curl and basically I just repeat the
same process over my all over my head
and I do Co away from my face that way
the fluffy curls are kind of flowing out
where whenever I get finished you'll see
okay now that I am done with all of my
curls instead of brushing through them I
just kind of flip my hair backwards and
shake them out that way the curls kind
of stayed together and it this is what
really makes them super fluffy and nice
and then I just twirl my hair around and
kind of fluff it with my hands but very
gently that way I'm not breaking up the
curls and making my hair frizzy as you
can see my second day hair is now
revived yes girl and we'll move on to
the outfit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
