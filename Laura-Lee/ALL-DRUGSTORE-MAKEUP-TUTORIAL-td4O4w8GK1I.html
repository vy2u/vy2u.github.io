this video there's not going to be a
four-minute intro we're going to jump
right in the tutorial and get started
hope you guys like this look if you do
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe before you leave as I said
this is an all drugstore makeup tutorial
so first I'm going to go in with my NYX
Angel Vil primer and I'm just going to
add this two areas where my pores are a
little bit showy showy then I'll go in
with my favorite foundation which is the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation I'm in shade 220 and I adored
this foundation then I'm going to blend
that out with an F 88 kabuki from Sigma
Beauty or you can use your meaty blender
where you can use your hand use whatever
works best for you then I'm going to
fill in my eyebrows I'm using this micro
pencil from NYX Cosmetics and I got this
shade chocolate and it's a little bit
warm tone for my eyebrows so I'm not
gonna lie I did have to go in with my
honest Asha brow Wiz to even out the
color but I do love the NYX micro brow
pencil in the right shade next I'm going
to go in with this beautiful color from
pixie it's just a really neutral brown
color and I'm going to be using it as a
transition shade I did use the Milani
runway eye primer which works fabulously
but I am always sure to use a transition
shade helps soften up that tacky tacky
eye primer next I mixed together two
brown shades from the Maybelline nudes
palette these colors are not that
pigmented in this palette so I did have
to pick up a lot of product on my brush
and I did experience quite a bit of
fallout from doing that but overall I
think it made the look look really
pretty so I'm just going to blend that
right on top of the transition shade
into the crease using the e25 brush from
sigma or you can use your elf brushes or
your real technique drugstore brushes I
don't have all this on hand so that's
why I'm using my Sigma brushes anytime I
use a dark shade I'm sure to blend it
out because it can get so crazy and just
so harsh I go in with the e-40 brush to
blend that out so going in with the
comfort zone palette from wet and wild
you guys request it I do a look with
this color
like this blue gray green no its color
it's like super arid essent and gorgeous
and super pigmented so I'm just packing
that all over my whole entire lid as you
can see it is super pigmented so I
didn't really have to use that much
shadow and I'm going to blend out that
crease with the e25 next I'm going to go
in with this shimmery dark shade I'm
going to pop that right in the outer
corner of the eye just to smoke it out a
bit and notice I'm using a super super
soft hand I didn't want to mess with the
shadow on the lid or move that around
too much but as you can see like look at
all the fallout that's right below my
eyelid I did go in with a web makeup
wipe and clean that up before I
continued
now I'm gonna go in with the brow bone
shade and I'm gonna put it on my brow
bone
look at that I'm gonna add it on it is
such a pretty color too I love this
champagne yellow tone brow bone color
then I'll go in with my tried-and-true
and YC liquid liner this is about two
dollars from the drugstore and it's
probably one of the best liquid liners
you can have on hand I love the brush on
it makes it so easy to do a winged liner
now I'll go in with my lash sensational
mascara from Maybelline she's going with
it is that Maybelline that may not be
Maybelline anyways I'm just gonna give a
few coats on my lashes because we're
going to be adding falsies next I'm
going to be adding a little bit of the
NYX HD concealer I'm in shade cwo for
beige this is one of my favorite
drugstore concealers I mentioned it in
my drugstore must-haves that I uploaded
last week this color is so pretty and
nice and yellow tone right from under
the eye and it covers so so well so I'm
just going to highlight the face with it
and then blend it out this is a 57 brush
from Sephora it's a concealer brush and
I like it because it's small and can get
right up in the corner of the eye right
there without messing up my eye shadow
I'm also going to blend this around the
nostrils as you can see on my other
nostril I get so much redness around my
nostrils not just in the winter time all
year long let's just like the color of
my skin around my nostrils super
annoying but I normally just drag a
little bit my concealer for my under eye
and patch that right on up
now I'll go in with this setting powder
from NYX is there cc correcting powder
and shade banana I'm going to pack that
everywhere that I put the concealer kind
of quickly that way it doesn't crease
this is also going to help our concealer
last much longer then I'll go away with
my current favorite bronzer of all-time
this one is by Neutrogena it's a new
healthy skin bronzer and it's so pretty
I like how it makes the skin look
bronzed instead of orange and it has no
shimmer in it I'm using this massive
powder brush just to bronze up the face
a little bit now I'll go in with this
wet and wild blush and it is super
pigmented I went in with a little bit
too much of a heavy hand so I ended up
having to spend a lot of time blending
that out now I'll go in with this elf
shimmering stick highlight this one is
in lilac petal I believe it's just a
really pretty cream highlight color
cream highlights to me stand out way
more in pictures than any powder
highlight then I'm going to add false
lashes this is my Vegas nay and I Laura
called shining star this lash went on
way too good I was almost confused I was
like wait is it on my eye like it just
went right on that was it boom done then
I went on with the transition shade we
used in the very beginning of the video
and blended that on the lower lash line
next I went in with a darker brown
shades I took out of the Laurie or
Maybelline nudes palette and blend it
that with a flat definer brush right
along those lower lashes so this is my
favorite drugstore mascara personally
this is the Milani runway lashes it
codes the lashes so well so I'm just
gonna pop it look at that face out with
making pop that onto lower lashes Coleen
Laura now I'm gonna go in with the NYX
nude lip liner this is such a pretty
color it's a dupe for strip down by Mac
it is a little bit creamier so I think
you could totally fill in your whole
lips with this but then I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of this Rimmel lip
color and pop it into the center and
that is it for this look I hope you guys
enjoyed thank you for watching and I
hope see you all in my next video back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
