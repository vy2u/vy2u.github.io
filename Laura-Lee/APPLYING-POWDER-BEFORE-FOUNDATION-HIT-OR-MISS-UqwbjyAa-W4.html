channel okay the other day I was in the
car and someone played my video balls in
the car and I heard my own voice mail
but ah I don't know how you guys do it
trust you used to it though anyway
today's video is very exciting because I
am going to be spilling the beans a
little bit on my March and showing off
some products also this video is going
to be me put your like what video do
that click on here but this video is
going to be putting on powder and then
testing out the foundation is kind of
going viral a little bit around YouTube
I don't know who start at the trend if
you guys want to comment the person who
started the trend in the description box
I mean you guys put inscription or in
the comment section so we can give that
person some love I'm sure people go back
and forth and battle it out so much
whenever it comes to like who started
something so I kind of hate even
dabbling in that super like calls out I
don't know what the big deal is but
anyways whoever you think started it
maybe comment their name down and show
them some love and everybody will be
happy
anyways I always try out do a little
wear test see how it wears is it a
gimmick or not also I'm gonna be sharing
with you my merch I'm going to go ahead
and share it with you in the intro and
I'll put the time stamp right here what
time the video start with me testing out
the power and foundation that way if you
just want to see that and you're like
girl I'm not interested in your merch oh
you can skip on over to that time stamp
and get started with a video if you want
to see more about the merch let's do it
right now so first off I just want to
say my website will be right here
the merch launches July 28th I have
quite a few pieces that I created myself
and I'm so excited about and I'm wearing
two of them right now so let me show you
the pieces first we have oh I forgot to
tell you guys my Instagram account
largely Los Angeles will have all the
updates and pictures and shout out the
people wearing my merch once it launches
I mean it's already up and running so if
you want to follow it for updates and it
will also have updates on my makeup line
because my makeup line will be ran off
that Instagram account as well that is a
mouthful okay so hat first hat we have
is Queen oh my gosh I love her this is I
love all the hats equally and I love
that we have pink white and black which
is my favorite color to wear so this is
my Queen hat it's a really fast way of
saying Queen and I always comment and
say Queen like
anytime I take it out I just go ahead
and spell it like that and it has a
little crown on it and then I'm wearing
one of my shirts
it has embroidery my logo on it with a
pink backsplash my logo is really fun
with the backsplash and I'm going to
change out the colors other the mainly
pink is like the original larlie Los
Angeles logo so this shirt is super cute
very very very soft probably should've
worn nude bra under it not blue but
that's okey and then this shirt is
awesome how cute and it is the softest
softest softest material and you can get
like a better image of it I'll put
pictures right here but also on the
Instagram account I am posting my really
great pictures of it on the body so you
can see how where I will have sizes
small medium large extra large and extra
extra large for sure anyway so here is
the hat and shirt and then I want to
share with you my kitty cat hat which oh
my gosh I love the outline of the kitty
kitty I'm obsessed and then this would
have looks like on and of course I see
look at that bang right there and then
it has the adjustable band in the back
so it'll fit all of our head and then we
have the large Los Angeles black
backsplash and broad rate at tank top
and white this is a phase small they're
kind of loose fitted and I'm meant to be
skin tight
what I like to do and again I show you
on the Instagram account I'll tie the
corner of it if you want it more time
fitting cute and the material like I
wish you could feel through the camera
it is the softest material ever it feels
like silky soft cotton these are 100%
cotton so of course washing them in hot
water and drying them they will shrink a
little bit next up to my favorite I'm a
t-shirt wearing gal like at nighttime or
chillin you guys see me on snapchat I'm
always wearing t-shirt so this is a size
small t-shirt she's been washed and
dried once she's wrinkly I already get
my together and on my shirt the
business a screen print with the Queen
which not just a hat and this one is in
heather grey so these are kind of women
tea shows because the sleeves are a
little bit shorter and to study smaller
but the middle of the t-shirt is a
normal fitted t-shirt again they're
really soft and I also have the exact
same t-shirt again this is a small this
and wash and dried the exact same
t-shirt and pink I've been wearing these
non-stop and these are my sample shirt
so that's why I didn't wash
dried but again it's the same situation
the sleep is just a little bit more
fitted and the rest of the show is a
good normal t-shirt so wrinkled I'm
sorry about that guys and again you can
see how they wear on my Instagram
account next we have a super super super
soft this is a small so as you can see
again if you want see out where check
out the pictures but again they're just
so silky and this is like a bobby pink
color really neutral ly pink and it has
an embroidery dat kitty cat and white on
it and they're really cool and airy for
the hot summer days because they're kind
of loose fitted not too sick well
there's this awful which this was a
pillow case and then I have of course
the cat purring just keeps going so we
have the backless shirt in black with a
cat with a white cat and it's backless
is the exact same shirt design that I'm
wearing right now except for it's black
with a cap on it and it matches the
kitty cat hot and my logo if you're
wondering is going to be on the inside
right there now my pineapple collection
I don't have the crewneck to show you
this is the crewneck that I have the
embroidery is more yellow and I want a
little bit of sparkle in it so they have
it finished I just have to go pick it up
like tomorrow morning so I have to list
me but I'll post a picture of the black
crewneck which is actually playing one
of my favorite pieces of the whole
collection and it's really really luxury
and nice and then I have the pineapple
tank like a really cool silky long tank
this one's a small they're loose fit it
and it has the black embroidery
pineapple on it that looks so much sorry
I'm looking over there I'm trying to
make sure I'm in focus and then I had my
childre hat which I love so much yeah it
is black and it's got a logo on the back
adjustable hot as well as the mint
colored chill bruh tank top this one is
a size medium if you guys can see
they're really loose fitted the medium
and the same soft silky material as a
Mavi pink cat tank top and this is one
that I also type in the corner so cute I
adore this line and again I'll have
everything all the information for it in
the description box down below so if you
want to know more about that they're all
you came to the right place
now we can jump right into the video and
let's go
started with our powder on top of an
election is it a gimmick I went ahead
and zoomed you guys in so you can see
the realty on my face or she is so
basically this whole bit is supposed to
give you like really flawless skin and
all and make you look beautiful and
flawless and great and fabulous and I
don't know any more adjectives to
express this to you I'm going to
moisturize the skin a little bit I'm
wearing this hat to hold my hair back
also have a lot of gray hairs right now
and I'm trying to hide them from you I'm
literally that person who like I just
something like I'm doing something I
have to tell like that fake extensions
and so once it's that pretty here like
it's all fake yeah so like if I'm hiding
these from you I'm not gonna be like
slick with I just I just tell people
just tell them what's up look I'm trying
to hide my grain here okay I'm going to
take it 41 brush this is the Too Faced
one this way at setting powder I've
really been enjoying it lately and this
is pretty much the right thing I believe
that people are setting their face with
I'm always going to moisturize my skin
no matter what so of course I did that
and now we're gonna really oh oh I'm not
gonna lie this just feels wrong on all
different levels like I have like a kind
of a rule of thumb where you put powder
on top of a cream you never apply your
powder and then a cream you know all
right let me tell you some tea about
this already
it's like putting powder on top of my
skin I have somewhat dry skin but my
forehead Oly so I consider my skin a bit
combination my penis feeling so tight
and dry right now because that's no
cream product like on top of it it's
like that's what it feels like I hope
that helps you understand what my skin
feels like but it feels so dry it's like
a desert a little like even when I
breathe in it but I'm published
breathing in the palette or I'm like so
we're not you testing this out I'm
actually going to mix together my alarm
RCA a flawless cheating foundation I've
really been enjoying this I have shade 4
in 1 &amp;amp; 3 c1 I can never remember the
names of these shades when I'm just like
dune and suntan that's what I should say
to you guys dune in Sun Tan I'm going to
base them together and they weren't
applying on top of powder and shot it
across the room
this is amore py6 and if you're new to
this channel this is my favorite brush
in the world alright so I have my brush
loaded wisdom so like about the put like
this on top of this is cringe-worthy
Highness cringe-worthy but it is a
miracle I probably won't do it again
anyways just because I'm like you can't
teach an old dog new tricks I'm kidding
but okay let's just do it
okay I did it I did it in the world
hasn't ended yet so I'm not going to lie
like even be putting that moisturizer on
right before I did it my skin still
feels tight but the great thing is we
can see how this potentially could work
for Olli skin because I was very frizzy
it's like this area
well my small an area kind of looks wet
I feel like it's absorbing my foundation
I'm not going to lie like whenever I'm
putting on my foundation I feel like
it's not going as long because my skin
is so dry with all the powders of the
powders trying to drink my foundation so
there's that that I'm noticing because
now I'm going to have to do an extra
pump and I normally don't have to hmm
I feel like my skin almost looks a
little bit textured because there's
something going on under the foundation
creams going on a powder I'm not on a
liquid so almost feel like my pores are
not looking that great and I'll do an
even more close-up you see I feel like
this looks super dry and OH
see that skin like showing off some skin
the pores are looking a little bit cakey
like even through here I physically look
a little bit cakey so with that being
said I think the next best thing to do
is to wear for a couple hours and then
come back and show you guys the tea
just kidding I'm right back I actually
wanted to go ahead and add some cream
concealer this is the NYX HD concealer
in shade beige cwo for beige I'm going
to go ahead and add some concealer
because it is another cream product and
just see how aware you guys like
I thought you were gone I'm just going
to take my I'm going to take my why 11
brush and just tap all of this out I'm
not allowed to add powder on top of the
concealer I think I'm just going to have
a very light layer if I don't like I'm
just going to tell you the concealer is
going to create some look bad and that's
just not fair
oh my skin still feels dry yo but let's
see what happens to the forehead even
though the forehead still can literally
I'm just going to take what's left on
the brush and just run it on the two
under eyes and that's it which is barely
no powder but I want to give it a fair
shot and we both know the concealer is
going to like ish if I don't add a
little bit of powder I'll be back wow it
is time for an update I've had that
candle burning all day it smells so good
that's what I always have it live back
there and be honest I'm quite kind of
over it
there's my heart okay here we go so let
me do it close-up I look so cakey and
not only that my foundation is so far
into my small line do you see like the
cake in the dry skin and my forehead
wrinkles look extreme like you're so
emphasized actually just because my
skin's not flush and you can see even to
see like layers of powder and foundation
like even here we have like I'm you
still so dry so you could take your
finger and scraped makeup like anyone
seen it's been about three and a half
almost four hours I would say they've
been wearing this and I can go ahead and
tell you that I don't improve it this is
almost like the exact reason why I don't
put creams on top of powders because it
gives you this look and just ten start
to look as soft flawless or natural like
from really far back you might be like
well she looks full coverage and I'll
tell you like this is super full
coverage putting powder under makeup I
didn't think my foundation would apply
quite as flawless as it did like it was
applying on my skin smooth I
figuratively like chunky balls of powder
which didn't happen which I'm likes I'm
surprised in like the overall result my
skin doesn't look good and my wrinkles
are so emphasized it is frightening to
me I'm not here for this
trend and makeup you know if it worked
for some people that's fine makeup work
so it's all differently but it
absolutely does not work in harmony
should I do another check-in I think
I'll do one more check in and like what
another two hours two or three hours so
I'll be back in about two or three hours
and Ellison you another chicken guys I'm
doing my last update from my couch
because we're going to do a little
iPhone moment look at my smile lines
without me talking
oh my dogs are so bad and the wrinkles
on my forehead I don't think even the
creasing look look at that under-eye
girl she looks like a mess so bottom
line is I don't approve this warm of
makeup it did not work out for me who
worked out for you I love you guys thank
