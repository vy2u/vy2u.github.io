today's video Aloha so they're way too
fast
okay let's slow down hey Gabi with
my channel today's video is going to be
as talking about the new honest Tashia
beverly hills contour kit I did get the
color light it is $40 and I did order
this palette myself and it came in
within two days I was like okay I'll
take it
I didn't even pay for the two-day
shipping and pamper once I'm in the box
so I will I have to film a video on it
I'm pretty excited about the palette and
I'm going to demo it out and show you
guys how I use it so if you're
interested in knowing more about this
palette or how to use this palette well
then please just keep watching coming in
this review kind of talk through of the
palette I'll put the time to the demo
and how I use the palette stars over
here that way if you're just interested
in knowing how to use your palette you
can just click on over to that time slot
so our three different palettes there's
light medium and dark they have six
colors in them each but some of the
colors repeat themselves in the palette
there's not like a total of 18 different
colors in the palette cinnamon nude
cream and over here you have banana
vanilla and cool pink they are somewhat
easy to come out however some of them
stick and can be very difficult to get
out like my nail scraped across one of
the colors and I was like wow and when
was the color light instead of medium
because some of the deeper colors and
medium I know that I can never use on
myself and I actually do use the darkest
color though to contour my face in this
palette I mix these two together this
color is more of the color of like my
foundation or my skin and I do make
these two two together to highlight my
face but I mostly use banana the pink
color for me is just way too light and
it's pinky tone and my skin is more of a
yellow tone so I probably won't get too
much use out of this pink color here if
you're looking to venture into cream
contouring I definitely recommend this
palette because the colors and are very
so about to drop it are very simple it's
a simplified palette
my personal opinion you don't have like
50 different colors you're just like oh
I don't know what to do I don't know
what to use you have six colors it's
pretty simple the banana color is my
favorite because a lot of green contour
palette don't put a yellow cream color
in it they just put like a light cream
color in it and then rather than it
matching to your skin and bringing out
your features it just makes them white
and I really don't like that look I
think that the banana color it really
makes it more natural for people that
have all of these skin tones if you're
kind of fair and I agree or you have
like that pink undertone in your skin I
think this actual pink cream color would
be beautiful on your skin I did post a
picture of the palette on Instagram and
I was like what do you guys think and
surprisingly I own negative feedback
north towards me but just towards the
palette and people's opinion on them
coming out with cream contour palettes
now it's just like whoa I was really
surprised but there were a lot of
comments with people were very excited
about it coming out but a lot of people
were like why are they coming out with
all this stuff they should stick to
eyebrows I don't like the shades they're
way too warm tone I will say all the
colors are very warm toned and sometimes
I like a nice cool tone color to contour
my face with and I don't know they just
have really warm undertones and these so
that's something I'm a little in about
but it does blend out really nice on the
face the colors are super super super
creamy and at first when putting my
brush into it I was like great this is
going to take me forever to blend out
because they have a thick consistent see
to them and they are very pigmented so
once of course I covered my face in it I
was like a year later I'll have this
blended out because the main key in
contouring and hell on your face is your
blending skills comprising Lee it
blended out so easy I was just like
amazed by it I really was because what
you feel you feel something very thick
like a cream concealer and E I will say
I do have dry skin but I do moisturize
my skin before I apply my makeup and I
did find that
under-eye area was very dry looking in a
bit cracky which was a little bit upset
about it was a little bit dry I do have
a setting powder over it so it looks a
little bit better than it did but all
this up in here was very Creasy and you
could see through the actual Kaaba Nanna
color you could see my skin through it
so it didn't really provide much
coverage up in this area but as I
blended it out on my skin I mean it did
do a little bit better but I don't know
I wasn't really happy with the creasing
and just kind of splotchiness of it so
if I did have something to complain
about with this palette it would be it
is it isn't very it's creamy but it
doesn't cover very well with the dark
circle area and it did crease up and I
didn't like that about it because it is
blend out really easily but at the same
time I find that it is a little bit dry
it was very weird because I didn't think
it was going to be that way because
whenever you touch it it just feels so
thick and creamy you're like it's gonna
be the thickest coverage you know but a
lot of times coming with a lot of thick
coverage too you do get your creasing
because there's just so much makeup but
it really doesn't feel very heavy on the
skin by any means and I do love that
about the palette a lot of people ask me
does this work well with dry skin or
always he and I think this is going to
be a better palette for someone with I
mean I have dry skin and it did gather
around my dry patches a little bit as I
normally use like a liquid concealer to
highlight contour my face when using
creams just because they don't tend to
stick to dry areas whereas I found that
this one's it a little bit but whenever
you get into these cream palettes they
all kind of tend to do that well as far
as with me they tend to do if you have
oily skin I think it's going to be
beautiful on your skin it is lightweight
on your skin which will be good too with
oily skin but definitely need to set it
and you need to take a setting powder
wherever you go with you because
whenever you apply foundation and this
much more of makeup on top of your
foundation it can build up and get
really cakey crazy Gracie and also I
think this palette because it only has
six colors and I think it simplifies the
process of contouring and highlighting
so if you're a beginner in it I do
recommend the palette to you
this about is made for pro artists is to
be a pro palette you to be a makeup
artist you would have to buy all three
because our clients aren't going to be
with the shades light or the shades
medium or the shade steep they're going
to be a mixture of each I think that's
also a downside in the palette as far as
your pro and they don't have the
individual refills so you could create
your own palette for so yeah so that's
another downfall I don't understand what
the colors come out whenever you can't
buy the refills yet I think that should
have already launched whenever buying
the palette or if it is a pro product I
think you should be able to buy all
three palettes in a bundle for a better
deal or because I just know whenever I
used to do makeup like just me thinking
as makeup artist like that would be more
ideal or just have it where you could
create your own one palette something
like that because buying all three
individual palettes is not ideal for pro
makeup artists no that is my review on
this palette I like it I recommend it I
think it's good
it has pros and cons everything does so
but I think it's worth $40 I definitely
will be using it in the future I'm
really excited to play around with it a
little bit more because I love cream
contour ninh hi I hope you enjoyed this
review I hope you got something out of
it we're gonna switch on away we're
gonna cream contour and highlighter face
and I'll show you how I use this bad boy
do a start I go in with a synthetic
brush creating triangular shapes
underneath my eyes because the light
hits down on your face in a triangular
shape instead of Ramat shape so this is
going to make a more natural effect I
use banana and just a touch of vanilla
to lighten up the yellow color a little
bit and then I'm using a synthetic brush
I also take this hello down the node to
get nose to get the appearance of a
perfectly straight nose I'm going to
highlight a hole on my forehead because
I have a small forehead and I like to
make it look just a little bit bigger
than what it is if you have a big
forehead don't go as high up as I'm
going with your highlight next I'm going
to highlight to chin this is going to
make everything match in unison and I'm
also going to highlight the Cupid's bow
to get the illusion of a bigger upper
lip then I'm going to go in with
cinnamon and a touch of new
and I'm going to streak this right down
my cheekbones I'm also going to hit the
temple area and bring it up all around
the forehead at this part you would
bring down your contour darker color a
little bit more if you want your
forehead to look smaller I'm going to
connect this in a C shape and then we'll
blend it all out and it look really good
I promise I know it looks crazy right
now this little brush from Sigma is
beautiful it's like the mini 3d kabuki
to do the nose this is going to give us
the parents of that straight perfect
nose I am taking cinnamon right down the
sides of my nose connecting it on the
tip of my nose then I'm going to give
the illusion of a perfect rounded chin
by contouring my chin and I add a little
bit of highlight right underneath to
enhance the contour and I also do my
brow bone area just to give us a lift to
make it look like our eyebrows and the
eyelids set a little bit higher than
what they actually do and this is what I
end up looking like before we blend it
out now going in with my damp Beauty
Blender you can even spritz this with
the Mac pix plush spray I'm going to
start dabbing this out I'm not doing
swiping motions I'm just doing dabbing
motions because you don't want to move
the color around because we place them
in very strategic areas and we don't
want to move it around much we just want
to soften it and blend it out as you can
see this stuff blends out crazy easily
it's just so easy to blend out I love
that about this palette and that's why I
say it's so good for beginners this is
the 3d kabuki brush from Sigma and the
way I blend out the cheeks is I work the
color upward that 3d shape just fits
perfectly in the cheekbone you're able
to blend upward and then I blend up and
down on the forehead this is going to
take the little bitty 3d kabuki I'm
going to blend out the nose bringing it
up into my brows and then I go back in
with my Beauty Blender and I'm touching
up the highlight just what we covered it
up a little bit this is our final look I
just think the pace has structure it's
just not all one unison color it looks
more natural I like the way it turned
out in the end and I did set this with
the Laura Mercier setting powder that is
