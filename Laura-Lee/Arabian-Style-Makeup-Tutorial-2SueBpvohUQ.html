happy you're here today because we're
gonna be creating this look you guys
have been asking me for something a
little bit more dramatic and I have
produced so I hope you guys like this
tutorial it is a very heavy um
type of tutorial and I think it turned
out absolutely gorgeous also I wanted to
say before we jump in this tutorial that
it is a collab with my beautiful friend
Irene I love that girl she has more
personality than a fryer cracker and
lucky enough to have the opportunity to
hang out with her some personally and
know her personally and she is just an
awesome person her beauty is from the
inside out her makeup is a whoa BAM I
mean and we won't even get started on
her hair because I'll talk about it all
day long I love her hair it's always so
full and fluffy you minds like Irene can
fix my hair he is going to be doing a
makeup tutorials it's a little bit toned
down but she's also going to be
incorporating some blue into it it's
gonna be flawless I can't wait for you
guys to see it be sure to subscribe to
our channel while you're over there show
her some love and support from this
family on YouTube and if you were over
here from her channel what's up in logos
with my youtube channel
we're just gonna jump right in and get
started
hey guys we're gonna get started I'm
really excited to show you this look
isn't this crazy legs whoa this game
started I did go ahead and apply my
foundation as well as a primer to help
smooth out my skin before I applied the
foundation I used two Smashbox this is
the photo finish pore minimizing primer
a pretty awesome one can see that as far
as foundation I use this hello flawless
oxygen Wow foundation from benefits been
a long time since I use this stuff and I
just got a new one
I also primed my eyes with my Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre I used to call that
orchard but we learned we'll start off
with the e30 8 brush from Sigma I'm
going to grab a little bit of Peach
Smoothie from makeup geek I used all
makeup geek products on my eyes so those
are very affordable to recreate this
look I'll link them all down below as
well as everything else that I use so
I'm going to be blending this right into
the crease this is going to soften up
that base and help everything else blend
really nice this will also make the look
look a little bit more gradient so
something else I'm going to do to even
warm up this look a little more going in
with the same brush I'm gonna grab a
like a dot of the shade chickadee and
facing the brush upward I'm going to
blend this in the crease a big mistake I
see people make sometimes not all the
time is they blend their colors like
down into their crease where I see I'm
blending it like my upper crease area if
you have small eyelids you may not
definitely make sure that you're not
blending and taking up your eyelid space
you're focusing the color more silic on
the actual light top of the lid not the
eyelid this area you know what I'm
saying but that's done going in with the
same brush I'm going to grab a little
bit of cocoa bear which is a really warm
brown tone color and I'm going to blend
that right on top of the other colors
but using a little bit
less of the eyeshadow and then taking my
time I am going to try to focus it a wee
bit lower than what I did and not bring
it all the way up
I brought the other colors almost to my
brow bone but not quite and I'm going to
focus this all the way from this inner
corner to the outer corner next I'll
take an e58 brush this is a flat shader
brush from Sigma I'm going to dab it
really well into the color mermaid from
makeup geek which is this beautiful blue
color and I'm going to miss the brush
with my mac fix+ spray this is gonna
help the pigment to stay and to be like
really bold because we want this blue
color to be like wash touch my eye
little you don't have to do that because
I know premature wrinkling but I'm going
to pack this color on to the lid and you
want to bring it all the way up to the
very top of your lid and I'm basically
going to cover the whole entire lid
other than just that outer corner I'll
take an e39 brush from Sigma which is a
buff and belen brush it's just a short
brush for blending I'm going to take
corrupt which is this black color into
the outer corner
I'm also going to drag the color about
to the center above a little bit swiping
back and forth really light hand I'm
using I'm not pressing down hard at all
just going to light hand soften it up so
that way we are nice and clear radiant
everything is blended out well taking a
firm shader brush this is a e57 I'm
going to grab a tiny bit of shimmer
shimmer with a really light hand tap cut
the excess off you can leave your brow
bone alone if you want to I'm just going
to shimmer it up a touch well do winged
liner I'm using this eo6 brush from
Sigma it's perfect for winged liner I'm
going to be using my English L liner as
well as a little dirt line to send it
out and make it more manageable I'm
actually dragged it out like that to get
that nice sharp point then I'm going to
go pretty much to the top of that liner
and just come down like that do is I'm
going to follow the line and just go
across my eyelid
so typically if I want my iron to be
super sharp I'll just grab a little
cleansing cloth makeup wipe edges I'll
be using my exact lint brush it's an e
thirty-two and grab a little bit of gold
digger so I'm going to dampen the gold
digger color I'm really going to coat
this area this inner corner and I'm
going to bring it up alright now we're
going to work on the point for the inner
corner
well then I'll actually come out here
and connect it I'll grab my mid sweeper
which is the EPD four and a little bit
of cocoa bear and I am going to coat the
lower lash line and I'm actually going
to bring this feather down that I am
actually the black color why my same
cord actually so much actually next I'll
go in with an e twenty this brush is so
awesome for the lower lash line it's
just like this flat shader it's called a
short shader and I'll go back in with
corrupt which is our black eyeshadow
shade literally going to keep it pretty
close to the lower lash line taking a
little bit of shadow at a time you don't
want to go in with a loaded gun here
it's a recipe for disaster
trust me
and I'm just going to take a little bit
of that gel liner and fill in our water
line so glad we'll just stick my
high-caliber lash mascara and I'll do a
few coats on the upper and lower lashes
then I'll be going in with violet Voss
lashes and striptease which are pretty
dramatic
they are foaming lashes
finish out the tutorial with a little
bit of concealer this is the better skin
concealer by Maybelline blending that
out with a 57 brush from Sephora
and with the f/64 brush from Sigma I'm
going to go in with my laura mercier
looks like this this is the translucent
powder and I'm just going to set this
concealer to help it to last longer and
also prevent creasing and with my pro
bronze fusion by make it forever I'm
going to take this on a medium sized
brush
blush I'll go with benefits rocket or
blush blush smells so good
- it smells so good and for the
highlight you know we can really
roulette off I'm gonna be going in with
indiscretion from Laura Mercier me
where's my highlight brush the finish
off the look we're going to do our lips
for lips I'm using on Sasha dusty rose
