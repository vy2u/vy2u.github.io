video is going to be a hair tutorial
that I haven't done the hair tutorial
and forever in a day so I wanted to
create this a half up half down will not
this but you know what I mean like what
I'm gonna be doing a half up half down
hairstyle for you guys I am going to be
using some extensions in it I'm going to
be using my Bellamy extensions and I
always help a little bit about these in
the beginning of the video just to let
you know the rundown on them and what my
thoughts are and how they work um so I
hope you guys enjoy the video be sure to
subscribe before you leave um you know
because I'm posting like three videos a
week and you don't want to miss out on
all the good stuff so haha okay that guy
okay we're going to jump right in and
get started I hope you're excited
because I'm excited to share my hair to
work with you guys so uh let's get
started
that's the better snap first off let's
talk hair extension yawns these are by
bellamy these are not one hundred and
twenty percent sure how to pronounce her
name it is first
seiga merci de Jessica Postigo I'm
probably pronouncing that wrong but
these are the extensions that match my
hair completely the thing I love most
about Bella me is the fact that they
have a bazillion hair extensions to
choose from on their site so you can't
go wrong there's your options are
endless there and they have different
thickness different lengths it's amazing
so let me just show you real quick what
its gonna be like whenever you get your
extensions you'll get a fancy smancy
bomb my favorite things about Bellamy is
they come with a hanger storing
extensions laying them down will create
them to get matted also come with a
baggie to keep your extensions in I mean
you're all set up here it's amazing so
let's actually talk about the good stuff
the extensions so the way it works is
you'll get a pack like this this is my
second pack of these so I know the
rundown these are new so we're going to
open them together but you'll get a pack
and it looks like this and you'll see
the tester so this is for you to able to
test the length you'll be able to test
like it's it going to match you'll be
able to clip it in it's a nice little
piece of hair extension but you open
these bad boys up they are yours
it says right there it will void the
return if you pop these open and that's
when they give you a tester so you're
gonna want to test them out make sure
they flow with your hair the length the
color and you can like curl these blow
dry these wash these I normally don't
wash my too much because I'm nasty Oh
fresh look at this fresh extensions
these are the match to my hair I mean
it's like perfect a match we had a piece
here that has five clip ins which is
going to be your biggest piece of
extension and then you'll get pieces
that are a little bit smaller so like
this one has four clippings and they
just pop the little clips they're pretty
common hair clips and also use my
discount code
lauralee very easy it's just my name to
get money off of your hair extensions so
I will be incorporating these in the
video for you guys to show you how I use
them I'm going to clip about half of my
hair up grabbing the crown on my head
and I'm just gonna swish it around and
take this little clamp err I actually
like to do is go ahead and pop all of
them open and you're gonna see just how
well these blend with my hair and how
real and natural they look they don't
look really thin or stringy you know
sometimes you see extensions it's just
like clumpy or stringy you can totally
tell us an extension you're not gonna be
able to tell at all so what I like to do
because my head is actually small like
this slice at my head if you have a
bigger head you probably won't have to
do this is I like to clip the hair
extension within the hair extension
meaning I take these two together and
just pop them in together and this
allows me to apply more hair and just
have to clip one less track into my
scalp these are very comfortable hair
extensions if you do have thin hair you
might want to take the piece of hair
like this and tease it underneath or
backcomb it right here and then clip
your hair in just to get the hang on now
I have two extensions clipped in
together I'm going to swing this around
and what I like to do is just kind of
measure like okay that's about even I
like these in the center and I'll just
start popping a man
okay so now that my extensions are in
watch how natural it's crazy right but I
will typically do is I'm going to go
ahead and take down this half of my hair
grab more of the crown but leaving some
hair down to cover that track now I'm
going to take a piece it is smaller it
has three Clippers and I'm just going to
focus these more so like on the side of
my head
like that now I'm going to take this
little friend here and do the exact same
thing to this side of my head and now
I'll let down the rest of my hair I am
with my extensions and as you can see my
hair is like B volume so much more
volume in it but it looks so natural my
hair looks so nice and thick we can curl
these and we are going to curl these let
me just say that this extension and your
hair doesn't hook curl well because you
have sleek hair are just naturally
straight hair the extensions will hold
curl very well so it'll help give you
even more of a curl if you're dealing
with that my hair holds curl pretty well
so it just goes with the flow of the
extensions these fit nicely to your head
they don't pull so the more hair you get
in that clip the more comfortable the
extensions going to be if you get a
little strand of hair like this and the
clip it might pull the hair so you want
to kind of get like a chunk of hair and
if you do that you'll be way more
comfortable with your extensions and
you'll be able to wear on all night and
all day long for this tutorial I'm going
to be using the Bellamy 12 in one piece
set it comes with the ten and one
complete curler set a mini blow-dry I
Flatiron it comes with styling combs
clips gloves he protecting mat
everything you need and you can use code
I love Bellamy for money off your set
I'll have it in the description below
I'm gonna be using the biggest one that
comes in 212 in one set so it looks like
this it's pretty mediocre size one and I
am going to pop on my glove that we
don't from a little fingers off oh okay
to get started with our ariana grande
half up half down hairstyle I'm going to
take a piece of hair about this size and
then I'm going to take my one place it
behind the hair and I will wrap the hair
around it like a ribbon not twisting the
hair because I want to curl not a wave
and I'm gonna let that on there for
about 10 seconds maybe a little bit less
depending on how fine your hair is and
then once I release the hair I will
squeeze the heat out of it this will
help the piece of hair to stay curled
much longer and you're going to see how
gorgeous is that piece of hair I love it
so basically we're going to repeat and
do the same thing over and over I have
the extension mixed in with my natural
hair and it curls just by if anything it
helps my hair
grow a little bit more and yeah
now I'm just going to let down the
second half of my hair and I'm going to
do the exact same thing I'm going to be
wrapping the hair around the one like a
ribbon and squeezing the heat out just
repetitively over the whole entire head
again doing it to the crown I will let
you know I like to part my hair in the
middle and curl it that way when we put
it in the half of the curls about facing
outward so now what I'll do then I'm
done now that I'm done I will shake out
the curls just to loosen them isn't that
amazing look how much hair I'm obsessed
I love big volume as glamorous curls I'm
obsessed with them so then I will take
the hair starting from the front of the
head and just scooch all the way back
and pick up the crown of the hair I will
put it up pretty tight I do run my
fingers through it to get it kind of
smooth on top and then I'm just going to
tie a small elastic around the hair try
not to create too much of a mess and I'm
also sure to make sure the side tracks
of my extensions are still covered once
you got your hair all tied up I then
tighten it just to lift up that part a
little bit just make sure it's setting
up really high like ariana grande's hair
does then I will take a small string of
hair from the updo and I will tie it
around the rubber band just to keep it
neat and clean and I will secure that
piece of hair with a bobby pin by
pushing it underneath where the hair is
halfway up I'll then move the hair
around a little bit just to make sure
it's nice and fluffy and that's it for
this tutorial how cute is this hairstyle
