very exciting video today because
hopefully this video will save you a lot
of money I mean maybe it will maybe it
won't we don't know we're gonna be
trying out to product it is the artists
brush oval six actual artist brush oval
six looks like this like a mini hair
brush but that is not what this is at
all and the bristles don't feel anything
like a hair brush they're like really
soft and by really soft I mean extremely
soft let me just start by saying I love
super annoying I know
Yanis brushes I think they're absolutely
amazing I think there's a coolest
invention ever and they won't blend out
your makeup and just minutes they will
create the smoothest contour ever okay
I'm done talking about them anyway so I
was shopping on Amazon and a suggestion
popped up for me to buy and it was an
artist brush for $1 I think was $0.99
and I was like what what planet are we
on right now
this one's 55 a brush for $1 I was like
there's no way this is gonna be the
biggest piece of crap ever so of course
I edited it to my car a 9/10 brush
versus a 55 dollar brush we're gonna be
testing them out in this video and
seeing the truth behind them hope you're
excited for this video and be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
for lots of cheap dupes I'm always on
the hunt for dupes and we'll jump right
in and get started
let's do it jumping right in what better
way to try out these brushes than to
actually test them out on our face so
I'll try the $1 brush out on one half
and the $55 brush out on the other half
first I'm going to start priming my skin
I'm squinting the lights for some reason
today are just like super bright am i Oh
any time I apply foundation to my face I
mean the first step is to get that
primer today I'm using the pores no more
by dr. Brandt next time I take a little
bit of my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD just
for your information I'm shade white 3 6
5 however I use my artist brush to blend
out my foundation I always just apply
the foundation to my face first all
right starting out we're gonna go in
with our $55 brush I'm going to do this
side what I like to do with these is I
don't typically like to pick them up off
my face I like to like smooth it out
like butter and I will pick it up and
just move to the
4head like that but I typically like to
keep it on my face you drag it all the
way down I will tell you there's like
thousands and thousands a little
microfiber hairs and these that actually
is what's blending out your foundation I
know it looks like a hair brush but it
this one is incredibly soft like it
feels like velvet going across your face
instead of like an actual brush which as
you can imagine what it feel pretty raw
putting a brush in your face but just
know this feels smoother than a makeup
brush it feels smoother than abuse
plunge it just it's incredible I've been
using these non-stop and they blend out
your foundation seamlessly with
absolutely no streaks no like little
hair marks and so many different little
hairs in it little fibery hairs that it
can't leave streaks into your face and
they're so compacted in this brush so it
just becomes an all-in-one I'm going to
go and tell you that obviously if you
follow me on Instagram you know I use
these day in and day out um so that's
I'm really interested in this dupe
because I know that these are really
pricey um but I do love them here comes
the test of all times I can go ahead and
tell you that this brush feels a lot
lighter than the artist brush as far as
the weight a handle on the cheaper brush
it's not nearly as nice as the artist
brush this has a rubbery grip on it they
do have the same structure so you're
supposed to be able to put your finger
and use it kind of like a finger
bristles on the artist brush they feel
almost just this soft but it almost
feels as if there's more bristles in the
more expensive brush but the true test
is the performance of the brush so we're
going to use it just the same okay right
off the bat I'm going to go ahead and be
extremely honest it feels a little bit
more rough not rough as to where it's
hurting my face or I think it's going to
cause an issue but it doesn't feel it's
softest the artists brush but it does
feel soft the brush handle isn't as nice
but it is seems to be working as well
over me using the brush a little bit
more it is feeling a smidge bit rougher
than the artist brush so this one um be
honest feels a little bit
more dense it's like the more expensive
Brussels flex better than these these
are a little bit stiff so I think that's
why I'm feeling the roughness of it
because there are not quite as bendy I'm
going to let you get a really good
close-up this without me touching this
foundation or anything like that and
I'll let you see
overall the finished product of macro
foundation I can't tell a single bit of
difference my foundation looks just as
smooth on each side it looks just as
flawless on each side did I just call my
foundation flawless yes I did a handle
of this brush is not as nice I do love
the rubber grip because you have to
remember you're like gripping the brush
to smooth it out all across your face on
this one you can tell it's cheaper I
mean you hold it in it's like this cheap
plastic one however I did pay a dollar
for so what are you expect and in my
personal opinion I think applying
something rough on your face day after
day day after day day after day could
potentially cause some wrinkling damage
the actual performance of them it's
equal a dollar versus fifty five dollars
I can't I'm gonna stop beating a dead
horse here there are pros and cons to
this brush right here let me know in the
comments your thoughts let me know in
the comments if you tried out a dollar
artists brush let me know in the
comments if you tried out a real artists
brush I would love to know your thoughts
on these I adore these brushes I use
them day in and day out I love you guys
thank you so much for being here on my
channel and I hope to see you all in my
next video bye guys subscribe before you
