today's video is going to be my August
favorites and I have lots of good stuff
to share with you um got laid the month
of August flew by and I always liked
mumps don't fly by I feel like we're
there for a hot minute if a dog is a
sight on now we are in September
transitioning into fall month we got
lots of good stuff to share with you
can't wait for you to see it um thanks
for being here by the way it's like I
never say that thank you for being here
right now we're gonna jump right in and
get started don't got much chitchat
happening so leg up first I start off
with my favorite TV show in song of the
month favorite song of the month is
every single song by Shawn Mendes as you
guys probably know you heard a little
bit of his music at my videos I'm
obsessed with this new album a really
long time since I had a guy crush on
some like singer do but totes got one I
don't know it's not even that his looks
it's more so his voice is very unique
and beautiful and I love his whole
entire album it's gorgeous
favorite TV show I don't got one I
literally haven't had two seconds to
watch TV I mean I watch my typical
Family Guy American Dad Cleveland Show
those are my jams as well as The
Simpsons because I'm nothing but a big
kid here I didn't really pick up any new
TV shows I just haven't had time to like
really sit down pay attention and get
into any new show so that didn't happen
I will talk about products in are my
favorite and I have to share with you
something that I've been this is like
the best hair remover I probably use it
on areas that are too big just because
I'll start using it to trim the upper
lip the eyebrow hair just small areas
maybe a little bit of hair right here
that's what it's good for
and then I get carried away and I'm like
literally wanting to cut everything it's
not what it's for is for smaller areas
it's amazing hair remover it's not gonna
cut you it takes one little battery to
run it it's great portable carry it my
luggage when I travel throw it my purse
especially okay guys my knees like
they're so naughty that I miss little
hairs and just a spot touch-up
just like like I'll be here all day but
just like to get a hair or two on your
knee or even your toe I know we grow to
hair don't like you don't for the bikini
line it's just so great just to touch up
who this item is just such a little gem
to me I also have a discount code down
below for free shipping on them they're
only $9.99 I mean it's FYI they come in
two different styles there's like this
teal zebra print and then the pink
cheetah print I like the pink cheetah
print it's just more me but um it's just
perfect for touch-ups spot removal of
hair I love this little guy right here
he's my best friend and he stays in my
purse you know if your friends get a
little mustache hair and the name of it
is the finishing touch product I want to
talk about is this palette by morphine
you guys already know what I'm talking
about this is the 35o palette I've tried
out just about every page mate all jokes
aside that hurts so bad I have tried out
so many palettes I don't know what it is
about this one you get 35 different
colors as do you and the other ones but
I could use every single one of these
colors in a wearable way they're all
warm tones that are so easy to use and
build up upon each other and this one I
don't know what it is about them being
so blendable but they're outrageously
blendable and the shapes laughs really
well so very good deal I don't know it's
probably still sold out but it comes
back and then it goes away and then it
comes back so else I'm saying here then
it comes back and you see it I would
definitely snag it I think it's a great
value deal next product I want to talk
about is what's on my lips right now it
is this over cosmetics liquid lipstick
in I think it's called minna mi na their
liquid lipsticks are very affordable
very creamy nice and soft
I lived them I love them I loved them
and it is like the fall lipstick X
product I want to talk about is this one
by G way this is actually an eyeshadow
and I'm
using an eyeshadow because I'm a weirdo
and I like to break rules and do what
kinds of stuff my sister just had me a
picture of herself she dyed her hair
pink and now she's dying it back Brown I
mean she didn't mean to dye a pink it
was an accident this is chestnut so this
color right here it's just such a great
cool tone brown shade and it's like a
big eye shadow so it works for me great
for contouring
I typically grab this small contour
brush I mean and we just sharpen up
those cheekbones
make them razor sharp I'm just kidding
not razor sharp but you get what I'm
saying I mean it's just so great to
contour with it is the contour shade
it's really hard to find good cool tone
shades contour with and I don't know why
this is that this shade is just like yes
sparks I have been absolutely adoring is
this Smashbox photo-finish pore
minimizing primer this one has made it
have this one has made me even been in
my favorite Sephora I don't know I may
be a repeater right now but I've just
been silicone base but it's all free so
it just glides on and it mattifies the
skin if you have oily skin girl this
might be give me friends really good for
minimizing any areas that did it such as
pores in your face maybe even have some
acne scarring kind of filling that in
just soften up your skin and then put
your foundation on top of it wham bam
thank you ma'am
yes moving right along I have a brow
pencil from Smashbox which I've been
testing out I actually went to a little
Smashbox event and I got it I believe
this cost $21 at Ulta or at Sephora or
whatever you want to buy it but this one
is in brunette and they came out with
new brow pencils and they work really
well the very nice texture about the
same price is a massage is so really
compared to about the same thing so the
price point doesn't break that is it
gonna break that for you but if you
should want to try something new I
recommend the Smashbox brow pencils
they're new and they're also so another
product that I've had but I know you
guys would see me use it quite a bit in
tutorials and get ready with me this is
the NYX color correcting powder this one
is in banana
let me just tell you what happened to me
I went to Miami and forgot to pack
concealer like I always forget one thing
so it's until this time but it is
a little bit of extra foundation on my
under-eye area and then I packed a lot
of the NYX CC powder on top of it I let
it sit there and cook it's called
cooking it's also called baking whatever
you prefer you get what I'm saying here
I let it cook for a while and then I
dusted it off and you couldn't tell the
difference like this stuff is so
brightening and it doesn't flash back on
a camera so you're not gonna get that
super white under I would definitely
brine the motherlode out of my under-eye
it was like a lifesaver to me and I've
been using it consistently throughout
the month so it's definitely gonna have
a mention in my favorites okay next time
to products from benefit that has just
been my jam sesh there skincare I have
been tampering with their skincare and
trying it out throughout the month I'm
playing with a few other products to see
how I feel about them but as far as
these two I give these an A+
I really like the foaming cleanser which
follow me on snapchat you should be told
you guys about the foaming cleanser it
just makes your skin feel a clear have
you ever used a cleanser where you still
feel like maybe a makeup on or I don't
know if your skin's just not all the way
clean this just makes your skin feel
squeaky clean so I like that and then
I've always liked their serum I just now
have the full-size one I'm all shushies
samples of it and now I have like the
big guy this is their instant comeback
facial serum just supposed to help with
brightening and smoothing out the skin I
don't think it has any like acne
benefits in it it's just age defying
serum which always good to use I'm not
dealing with any breakouts right now so
I don't like to tamper with stuff that
prevents or helps in breakouts my theory
is don't fix if it's not broken if my
skin's happy I'm gonna kind of let it be
happy and not try all kinds of crazy
stuff on it
okay what I'm saying skincare product is
this Moroccan oil this is their dry
bottle and yes this product was made or
for me because I am one of those weirdos
who just hates the feeling of greasy
lotion like I just hate feeling like wet
greasy lotion all over me I mean I use
lotion because I don't want to look like
an ashtray late but this has just been a
great solution to me avoiding feeling
greasy oh it smells so good the smells
are really strong I'm not gonna lie to
you guys like you can smell it on your
body pretty intensely but I just like to
spritz this all over my leg
after I shower and it just my legs you
should drink it up and the my skin's
drive but it's happy so we're all happy
here also I want to mention these Helen
Hansen diamond flush topcoat this is the
most affordable yet most effective
topcoat that I've used I know in the
nail polish world there's lots of
controversy on what works and truly I
just believe it's depending on what
you're doing your your day when I was in
the medical field it didn't matter what
I put on my nails just washing my hands
and so much interaction my hands my
nails chipped with one day it didn't
even matter like what I use but now that
I'm in the makeup field it is pretty
aggressive on your hand still because
it's constant hands-on work but this has
been a pretty tried and true product for
me it's just their diamond flash topcoat
um and it stills the nail
do you want to see what that noise is
see this kitten he's eating the paper
Yoshi tell him he's got to get in
trouble
excuse me and it just seals and the
nails really nicely who more thing when
I mentioned to you guys is these boscia
black black charcoal blotting linens it
basically it's just an old blotting
sheet it smells like perfume like
straight-up a delicious at perfume it is
heavenly smelling I am a sucker for
anything that smells good and they do a
great job in blotting oh I bought some
from the Dollar Tree if you saw my
Dollar Tree ha and we kept me and tell
her he is very oily skin so we compared
the two on his skin and these just
killed it it was amazing how much I got
off his skin especially to the ones that
cost a dollar which I know they only
costed a dollar but it was just really
cool to see like how well these work I'm
holding him so he'll stop chewing on
stuff that is it for my monthly
favorites see cap moms have children too
I hope you guys enjoyed please subscribe
before you leave that way you're not
gonna lose me out in the youtube world
because it's a wild world out there
that's all I got for you guys so I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
