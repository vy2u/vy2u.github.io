she just released yes our YouTube
channel yes you guys can check it out
and it caught oh yes so if we link down
below as well as the video we're gonna
do on her channel she's gonna glam me I
am so excited guys I'm gonna try my
absolute hardest it's probably gonna be
as conservative she's nothing you can do
a thing I'm gonna try you I'm gonna
follow everything you just did and try
to remember and do it you can do it okay
I'm gonna try to fit me some good thank
you oh you have to see my subscribe song
with me yes I do I tried to like
remember it and like jump right into the
glue
yes about the glamper I am ready it's
cause I'm really excited
okay Amy do look what super glam this is
brush cleaner we won't we use I totally
know that's like a dream or something
all righty first I'm gonna be priming
her skin shut my hair up or something
yeah I think so thanks all right yeah if
you don't know Portland this is a really
nice smoothing and primer although she
doesn't have a pore on her face banks so
we're just gonna pretend that she does
mm-hmm it's just good yeah it's so nice
I just got the other day rubbing the
cheek hey there foundation she got a
spray tan so I'm gonna mix two shades
together and we're gonna make a
concoction mm-hmm I'm gonna use dune and
golden I'm just gonna stick these for
your face by Laura Mercier foundation 5
this is my first spring hand oh really
yep don't you love it yes I loved it
after the fact definitely the weirdest
experience probably yeah at least is
black is that white well no you're
literally broken on it now I am you know
it's always good to do that like yeah
see I need to learn from you as you do
it okay so I like to use this more py6
brush and skin
I'm gonna use a shade just a little bit
darker than her face I like a shade like
it's a little dark oh yeah yeah a little
darker and that way it's going too much
okay and I always get around the ears
I've definitely had instances where I
forget my ears in a Hall High Beach my
ears are different color yep I do that
too
I'll go to my mom's very much epic are
you all right Tate next up I'm gonna go
ahead and conceal oh good so I'm using
the NARS can be radiant concealer so
good so we're gonna do a video on your
channel uh-huh
of me doing this same makeup look yes
audio yes yes that's gonna have Mary
makeup guys cuz she's blaming me next
y11 I like to control my eye
why started no BAE am i doing wedding
makeup really yep that was you like you
- no no yeah brides are not the nicest I
bet too much stress on this I think
that's like it is full of stress and did
you like the bridesmaids also yep yes
like okay we're gonna bake her face not
a cake
it's baking do so it brightens your
under-eye even more and then it makes
the makeup last perfect like this
concealer will be here for three days
I've totally done that before I get
really good makeups and I'll sleep like
on my back it's really terrible
so doesn't go it's so not good to do
well and I like to mix together these
two makeup geek bronzers tani and
Sunkist ones really dark one isn't but
they make a great shade together that's
always smart to do I just need them to
make this a shade like mixing you just
mix mellows yeah right now we just do
what we make some yeah okay so what
other good stuff do coming up coming up
honestly
I've just been working on a lot of music
which is really great and you started on
musically yeah so I started lip synching
and now it's definitely a step because
now I'm back to really I'm really
singing so that's so cool I love that
bro that's so pretty
really is if I like making your own the
only fun part about making makeup is the
makeup exact all the in-between stops it
sucks so bad that's kind of how it is
with like music sometimes like the best
part is going into the studio and
recording and writing so many words the
business part is what Sokka so bad wow I
really just like started making
musically it's like just cut it's like
you know how before you hit social media
you just made like post an Instagram
picture just for your friends yeah see
or whatever that's how it was we would
you just literally make it musically so
yeah just just like just like I'd post
on Instagram or Twitter snapchat
anything and all of a sudden it got
featured which means oh well like on the
front page and musically yeah which
means like everybody sees the video and
so from there I guess people really
likes my video like start YouTube one
day I started YouTube YouTube is
honestly the best social media I love it
it's also the most powerful social
I think is it your favorite it's my
favorite mm-hmm it's like it's really
cool because I think YouTube shares you
in a way that other social medias can't
you suppose they have an outreach bigger
than any social media could ever it's
also a full-length video inside like
yeah no hate to any other social media
but Instagram it's like you know just a
picture or yeah they're just a few words
if you two can you connect exactly
YouTube you're sitting there talking to
someone it's real like when I'm filming
I'll talk to the camera but I it's like
it's like I'm actually talking to
someone like I think of it as I'm yeah
even though it looks like a camera but
it's talking to like an audience it's
really crazy I want to do start like
posting videos or when was your first
five years ago I started it's like your
favorite product or something um one of
my favorite products is probably I love
foundations mm-hmm a lot which is a
bizarre most people love color but I
love like a good really nice on the skin
I always start with okie-dokie because
it just softens up that concealer I just
named all the colors to ID it on
something that also another really fun
part
I bet how you decide um so me I'm kind
of random and with this palette I
literally like just took all the names
people kind of called me in the comment
section which is like scatterbrain she's
cray-cray bomb-diggity
that is so oddball oh my god so cute
these things people say that that are
pretty common so exactly so I'm gonna to
put bomb diggity and crazy I love it
nice eyelid thank you

don't you worry we have blue which is
like a little skittish stinker who like
runs and hides from everyone and then we

something

love it so literally stay in my living
room and play Nintendo switch yes it's
so fun and there's this one game where
it has like a bunch of other games on it

it those would you milk cows is the best
game ever

visit a lot for news I'm going to
Louisiana cuz we're gonna go

been oh yeah you get a cabin up there no
way oh my god I am asking you really no
voting is very hard it is very hard see
like I've wanted to learn but I don't
know what you wanted to learn
skiing is easier I'll tell you that it
is yeah how come it's just snowboarding
both your feet are strapped to one board
so you don't have really any type yeah
any type of help they're like you're
just falling on your ass all day yep so
