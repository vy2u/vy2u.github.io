raw chicken hey guys I'm gonna do my
intro and voiceover because these lips
it's real it's real okay subscribe to my
channel subscribe to my channel
somewhere Oh
skin it's so good
alright guys jumping in this Halloween
tutorial I took some liquid latex and I
took the brush that came with the latex
and then I smashed it into my bronzer
that was awesome alright then I'm going
to just apply the latex in a circle all
around my face this is the part of the
skin where it's gonna look lifted like
my facelift went bad then I take a
makeup brush that I really love and I
started to spackle the latex to kind of
make it look choppy I ruined the makeup
brush to make sure it's a brush that you
don't want to use anymore and this step
really saved me grief in the end because
I used this scar wax by Ben Nye I picked
it up off Amazon and I also picked the
little metal tool like this off Amazon I
start smearing it right on top of the
latex to really build up a fleshlight
peeling off effect and the scar wax does
not come off easy but because I put a
latex border down first it peeled off so
much easier I was so grateful that I did
that so then I just tried to build this
product up with a little spatula I'm
just scraping it out of the container
and swishing it around my face right on
top of that latex trying to really build
it up and make it look like my facelift
went bad and now my face is peeling off
or that like I woke up in the middle of
surgery
some like that I later find out it's
easier to actually apply it to my face
my finger and then use the tool to kind
of scrape it up like right here seeing
that it worked way faster so just do
this all around my face and I just
looks like mutated skin effect next I
went ahead and started with my nose I
wasn't absolutely obsessed with how the
nose came out so if you want to skip
this part by all means but basically my
goal here was to take the been nice scar
wax to apply it to the nose you're
trying to make it look like my nose was
lift it up like from a nose job
it was just a bad situation for me so
just apply it all over my nose then I
take the tool and I make a little slice
and the side of it so that way I would
have a divot to apply it fake blood it's
just a little bit of a foundation
because as you can see the scar wax is
not the color my skin so I literally
just covered my face including the scar
wax and latex in foundation with a
Beauty Blender in case you're wondering
this is a Smashbox foundation I can't
remember shade I feel like is 2.3 but
that's probably not my shade I don't
know but I cover the scar wax pretty
well and made it look a little bit more
like my skin then last minute I had to
go in with a little more latex because I
want it to be built up even more you
don't have to do that this is the best
stuff ever this is like clotted blood
it's like a scab almost so it's like
blood jelly so it's not runny it's not
messy I just took the flat end of the
tool and I applied that behind the B'nai
scar wax and I'll apply on top of it
because I wanted it again to look like
my skin's lift it up and that the is
blood you know starting to peel back
from my face it's really creepy even
saying this voiceover because these
aren't the things that I normally say on
a daily basis but I just do this all
around my face and I even take the tool
and try to push up the scar wax a little
bit to give it the illusion of lifted
skin well also when we have this time be
sure to follow me on Instagram I post a
lot of cool pictures every day and
sometimes I do Instagram makeup
tutorials and it's really awesome
yay follow me on Instagram and then
while we're working with blood I end up
going ahead and do my
I just take the sharp end of the tool
and just stick it right in those divots
that will you create a tear earlier I
was trying to create the illusion that
kinda like the nose was lifted from the
nose job but hmm
I had like a fight with my nose it
didn't come out just how I pictured it
in my head so I was kind of sad guys me
but anyways I bought these fake lips
these are fake lip implants and you just
pill a box just add water to them and
then stick them on these were super
annoying so maybe if you didn't want to
wear these out they look super cool for
pictures and for the tutorial so I added
them I didn't know they were gonna be so
annoying until after I was wearing them
and they're very sticky to apply once
you add the water and they stayed on
pretty well it was just so hard for me
to talk so I ended up taking off the
bottom lip in that intro because I was
like I can't talk to my painful and then
I went in and add that jelly blood all
around it to make it look like I had a
real bad lip job next up I went ahead
and tried to make it look at black eyes
because if you into surgery have your
nose broken for a nose job or what else
you'll normally have black eye so I just
took a bit of a deeper purple matte
eyeshadow with no shimmer in it and I
took my e25 brush from sigma and i just
blended that on the lower lot lower
eyelid area my lower eyelid I guess my
under eye and I'm taking a little bit of
my you a kitten liner this is just a
liquid pen liner I'm drawing the lines
as if the surgeon drew those to cut my
eye area flipper Creek Bay you can build
up the purple a little more at the end
of the tour I actually went in and add
just a little bit more purple to make it
look darker under my eyes and then I
went ahead on the forehead you little
arrows up as if the surgery was going to
give me a brow lift and lift all that
jazz up after I finished drawing all the
little lines and arrows on my face I
went ahead and got some gauze from CBS
and I wrapped them around my head to
really make it give the illusion that I
came out of surgery
and I wanted to make sure that the gods
didn't touch the bloody area and there
was a little skin showing so it really
looked like my face was lifted up so I
just wrap this around my head I did one
around the back of my ponytail that way
it was sure not to slide forward
I just cut the edge of it down and I
tuck it in right there and I just tuck
it right on in and while all that stayed
and then Tyler my friend Gabriel like
you should totally add blood to the guy
so that's exactly what I did I added
blood to the gods but not in any
specific area I just wanted to make it
look blood was seeping out of the guys
and this is the final look guys I love
