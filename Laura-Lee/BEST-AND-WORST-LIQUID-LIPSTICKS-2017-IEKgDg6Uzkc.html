liquid lipsticks football time love so
I'm going to throw in some lipsticks it
didn't work for me because I always

fun whenever we save our money on
products that don't work now like I
always say in all my videos if it
doesn't work mean this means it's not
going to work for you but I will explain
why it didn't work for me so you can get
kind of like a better idea as to why in
might not work for you also my nails are
Plain Jane and it's because they're
paper thin right now because I've had so
many gel polishes and acrylics on them
girl they are down for the count they
need a break
they're literally like chipping off like
so I'm growing out my nails and trying
to get them tough just so I can put
acrylics on top of them again so yeah

button we're going to go ahead and jump
right in today's video and let's get
started my cat scratching at the door
yes okay let's get started maybe we'll
go back and forth the favorites and then
when they didn't work out for me some
like that keep the video interesting so
first things first let's talk about a
favorite so my favorite liquid lipsticks
are from Auto Show Beverly Hills I love
her formula I think it is all of that
and a bag of chips and she is some of
the best colors out on the market a
couple a couple of my favorite colors
are these two plus a red one called
strawberry that she recently launched is
I think it's down in the purse I can't
find it anywhere but I thought I'd
mention it in the video anyway so you
would know
strawberry about us travel Hills is such
a beautiful like bright red color it's
like a ready orange II it is pretty okay
and I also love these too much
pure Hollywood I remember this color is
I bought this one myself and whenever
she first launched these like a couple
years ago I bought pure Hollywood and I
love a solid I typically wear this one
in the center of my lips with a darker
color on the outside also I love crush
girl you can see a lot of news in this
one because that is just my shade I love
a pinky nude they're just so easy and
wearable so the strawberry definitely
isn't it's only I had it on deck so they
look similar but once you swatch them
you can really tell the difference this
is pure Hollywood and then this one
right here is crushed crushes a little
deeper and obviously they're really
pretty if you mix these two babies
together okay some little lipsticks that
did not work out for your girl
it's the urban equivalent Stix now I've
heard a lot of bad things about these
before I even use them just being honest
and then so I was a wee bit skeptical
using them and I'll say maybe they're
not bad maybe it's just like hearsay and
then I use them and girl I did not like
them whatsoever it's not so much since
the formula is drying it's more so that
they're so streaky and you have to put
on like ten layers to get a nice even
color in them now the ones that are not
shimmery are not nearly as tricky as the
shimmery ones the shimmery ones are a
hot mess what the darker the color to
the streak here they get I don't know
it's just not a lot of even pigmentation
and the shimmery ones when you get them
on your lip girl they're just all over
the place whoo so I'm not going to
recommend these to you guys so let's
move right along some more and my
favorite liquid lipsticks are buy more
feet and these are a little more
affordable I believe these are $12 and
then of course you guys know the
discount code that you get money off as
well so I was offered a little skeptical
in trying these because morphe is known
I'm a more affordable brand and I say
liquid lipsticks they're big on brushes
and eyeshadows how are the liquid lips
is going to be you know I'm saying but
then a girl I tried them out and the
heavens started raining down upon me
they were fabulous they are just as good
as any of the high-end liquid lipsticks
the formulas great
I wanted it drying but they're just all
of them drying but I mean there's
drawing is any other look as it sticks
there's not specifically and something
that I really like about it is they
don't crap all over each your lips
how do you ever try to look well the
stick works like a million little cracks
not with these two of my favorite colors
and these are virgin and bloodshot
version is definitely my favorite out of
the whole collection of course it's a
pinky nude it's just so even in color
bloodshot is such a beautiful deep red
color however you do have to add a
couple layers to give it on perfectly
but once you get it on it feels so nice
and it's so beautiful on the lips I
highly recommend these to you guys just
a quick tip would look at lipsticks
they're very drying and if you appealing
lips a good way I used to have pili lip
so bad that I couldn't wear liquid
lipsticks my lips the skin would just
like fall off on 24/7 and then I
realized I wasn't drinking enough water
and I really up to my water intake and
my lip completely stopped feeling it was
like an overnight difference in my lip
so if you really appealing lips try
drinking it extra mount of water and it
really can cure it overnight
alright alright alright alright okay so
the next one but like don't work for me
is by Kylie her lip kids are so hitting
this to me some are actually really nice
and then some grow as soon as I feel it
on put it on my lips just get tight and
I feel like they're going to bust open
it's so friggin dry this is one that's a
bit dry for me it's marriage--okay
pretty color you know an ice pick
formula but it's just too dry these are
ones that like bust into a million
pieces on my lips and I just I can't do
it I can't wear it and I think is so sad
about these they smell so good and not
only that they're like really even in
color which is nice but girl when they
dry down it it looks pretty for a minute
but then all of a sudden I'm busting all
over the place and looking cry cry I
find that her lighter colors are a
little bit better as far as the dryness
isn't so bad the lighter the color but
if you get into any of the deeper colors
he's dry next up for some of my
favorites you guys already guessed it so
jeffree star cosmetics I really like
these I like that thing that I like most
about Jeffries is the fact that you get
so much pigment and the liquid lipstick
so you could take it out your dough
applicator and one swipe you could do
your whole entire loop so these are
going to last you for a long time also
they don't crack and bust all over the
place and they apply very evenly which
is nice even the darker shades apply
evenly there's easy going this is
uniform glide one of my save ease it's
like a redwood they burnt brick orangie
undertone to it like a brown sienna to
it it's kind of a I don't know there's
not a lot of this color going around and
I freaking love one another one is I'm
nude this is a color that I bought
whenever girl I didn't even get jeffree
star PR was just always on the site
stock in this color I'm nudists one of
the brightest nude colors and it is
perfect to apply in the center of the
lips it is something I've been wearing
for a long time and actually had to go
get it out of my purse to talk to you
guys about it in today's video and the
next one that I've been obsessed with is
a newer one from Jeffrey M mani mu a
it's I'm shook and I told him because
I'm so conceited
how kidding but whenever we were on the
benefit trip together and Jeffrey KB my
I'm shook and I put it all in a night oh
my girl this one was made for me like
Lilly made for me it looks so good on my
lips okay not being this big yeah but
I'm like oh my god I don't really have a
color like this it's like a Selman but
deeper pink but when I get it on it
looks a little red I don't know it's a
different color and I really like that
about it because um yeah it's nice to
switch it up in the pinky news you know
I'm saying
so here's unicorn blood I'm nude and I'm
shook all together and so you can see
how pigmented they are and how much
color you get and how non-straight just
no streaks at all and if you're
wondering whenever I use my vanity for
my background yes it is the Jeffrey's
choice of ellipse --tx that are setting
behind me okay all right let's move
right along next up is the Mac old
formula of liquid lipstick was way too
drying and my lips would live it would
like crumble off my lips and like get on
my chin because I don't know what the
problem was honestly uh it would just
literally start to break off my lips
drawing but I recently got I PR packaged
with a bunch of new shades and I'm like
okay here we go again let me try these
and they had to have changed the formula
because me and I believe the tons of
other people have talked to we all love
the new formula I don't know if they're
now making the old colors with the new
formula or not because I haven't
repurchase those but the new formula is
great the old Mac formula girl had my
lips literally the stuff would crumble
off my lips but I will share with you
guys one of my shades
this is unform Olay fabulous and it is
almost black but it really is like a
deep deep plum so you can kind of see
towards the bottom where it's sketched
out right there that it's a little bit
of a deep deep plum it's a very cool
dark grungy color and I really like it I
don't know if you notice this but liquid
lipsticks are tough to create in the
darker the color the more dry there's
more drying so you just have to find the
right brand who gets that dark color
done right and it doesn't come off your
lips with the old formula be aware of
the new colors I know there's the new
formula so they're great ABS two more
brands that I love and then one more
hate so let's keep it rollin the next
brand is the wet and wild liquid
lipsticks I feel like at the drugstore
every time they come out with a liquid
lipsticks it's actually more like a whip
situation and I personally like a liquid
lipsticks it's like liquid that dries
down to a matte finish this kiss proof
is really hard to find that but yet one
of the most affordable brands of the
drugstore came out with an actual like
matte liquid lipsticks it is kiss proof
and it was wet and wild and they're $5
apiece
they are a little bit thin but once you
layer them up girl they don't crack
they're not too drying and they're
extremely long-lasting and they look
beautiful on the lips so my two favorite
colors are nudie patootie and nudist
peach shocking right a nude and a nude
pink Laura what are we going to do with
you this is what they look like on these
are $5 apiece and they are just as
pretty as they are affordable my hand is
all kind of stained okay so let me just
tell you guys some other liquid
lipsticks it just didn't work for me I
don't have any of them on deck I was
trying to find one to show you but the
colour-pop liquid lipsticks they just
don't work for me they're just too
drying they crack into a million little
pieces on my lips
our only $6 so it's total a total bummer
but I'm just gonna be honest with you
guys they don't work for me
um this will be drying you know so I
don't have any on deck because I've
donated the ones that didn't work for me
but I do have another sip it didn't work
for me and as far as you a cosmetics I
really like these and I have a mini
sample because I don't have the big one
of this I don't know what happens to it
gobby losin stuff all the time I need
someone to help me anyways one of my
favorite colors by them is annoys at and
actually when my favorite pairing is
noise at and I'm nude by Jeffrey star I
like to put a noise at all over the lips
and Jeffrey stars in the center is the
duo from heaven okay
these are very even in color and not
only that they smell I can smell for my
kids sighing macaroons Pompeii I believe
that I pronounce the other one is
someone that kind of went viral around
Pinterest is like the end iridescent
peach gold color you can tell how thick
and creamy they are I love wearing these
I wear these all the time you can always
find these floating around the bottom of
my purse girl yes and I know whenever
they came out with those mini that
Christmas time they flew off the shelf
people was fighting for them but they
actually have that in the big size now
so don't worry there but yeah that is it
for my best and worst liquid lipsticks
