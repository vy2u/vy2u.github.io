video is going to be my favorite elf
products and I love elf i think it's
such a great affordable brand they're
very innovative yeah so crazy story is
me and ty were headed to New York last
week and I had filmed this video already
so yes is the second time with me
filming this video and I left the memory
card on the plane which had the video on
it oh I'm telling are you I'm telling on
you you better stop it stop it right now
but that's the second time you come in
this video I had a moment I was like
hope you guys are excited to see it and
we're gonna go ahead and jump right in
the video jumping right in and have all
my elf products that I love and then I
recommend to you guys first we're gonna
talk about in here God please tell me
both know one of the products aren't in
the bag pause right there ty can you
hand me something thank you so the first
product I want to mention to you guys is
the aqua primer mist this is a really
nice affordable facial mist I like to
apply this to my skin after I are let me
start over I like to pilots to my skin
before I apply my foundation only in my
skin is feeling a little dry it's just a
great way to prep your skin for the
makeup let me just have this that the
sprayer on it is powerful and you need
to hold it about six feet back or else
it will punch you in the face watch well
it's like your face will be soaked so
yeah I wouldn't spray this on top of
your makeup because I feel like it would
just melt it right and help your face
but it's a really great affordable way
to prep your skin especially if you're
dealing with dry skin before you do your
makeup alright next is the elf hydrating
bubble mask and they make a lot of these
in height
and brands but I'll made an affordable
option one and it's kind of cool how the
product comes out so it's this it's kind
of got it all over it but it's you just
press it and the clear gel comes out and
so you're like well that's not a bubble
Mouse so what you do is you just apply
it to your skin and wait for it wait for
it look it's bubbling it turns into like
a full Bo mask it's really cool this
mask is great for hydrating skin again
if you have dry skin and it's great for
cleaning out your pores and that's
pretty cool and it's entertaining and
fun to do so we are such a little weirdo
but I really like it I think it's great
and affordable and I definitely think it
does an amazing job of cleaning off the
skin as well as hydrating the skin I've
been really happy using it so I
definitely want to recommend this elf
skincare product to you guys yeah okay
next one of my all-time favorite
products from elf is their cream contour
kit this one is in shade light I believe
I think they have two different shades
in it I honestly don't use these shoot I
honestly don't use the two shades down
here because though a little bit warm
for my skin tone but this is the perfect
brown for me it has a great undertone
that's more of a cool almost a great
undertone which looks really natural on
my skin if that doesn't work for you
they have the warmer ones down here and
then this is a great yellow highlighting
base now I do like to apply a concealer
with this so because I don't think this
has enough coverage but it does on top
of concealer do such a great job of
highlighting the skin and they blend out
so easy they're so incredibly creamy
very creamy product but not too crazy
and I also like that it comes with a
nice big mirror on it great for travel
it's cream so it won't break also we're
going to talk about elf brushes by the
way next up I should have mentioned this
with skincare maybe but this is the elf
facial primer and it's like the most
generic bottle in the whole wide world
because it doesn't even say what is on
it it said it on the box but yeah but
this is an elf a primer frisian and i
like it because it is very it feels
expensive it's very nice on the skin
it's thick and creamy I feel like it
smooths out this
really nicely without that silicone feel
I'm not like obsessed with silicone
based primers I like them but they're
not like my writer dies you know I'm
sorry if I had to compare this one to
anything I would compared to the one by
soap and glory one heck of a blot or to
the makeup forever
I can't believe which one it is in the
charcoal packaging but I would compare
it to those it's a great facial primer
super foldable I recommend it next let
me recommend an eyeshadow palette to you
guys this one is one of my favorite elf
eyeshadow palettes I did a tutorial with
this way back in the day on my channel
this one's called naked these palettes
are $10 apiece and they're this one's an
all shimmer so you might have to you
know make some your own Mattson to do a
completed look but they're extremely
pigmented they also have other ones that
are different colors but I really like
done naked one the best it's very easy
to work with just so much pigmentation
for ten bucks and then you get six
colors which is really good and it comes
with a brush which is god-knows-where
but I highly recommend this palette it's
beautiful on eyes next part I want to
recommend to you guys is the elf this is
like a really great product to carve out
your eyebrows with now it has a shimmer
and matte side to it but both sides are
really matte there's not really much
shimmer to it period which personally I
opt for only a matte product to do you
see how they're both mad wants just
lighter once more pink but I opted for a
matte to go under my eyes not off Shaima
so I love this it blends out so creamy
it almost reminds me a little bit of the
benefit a little brow pencil thing so
it's almost like a dupe for that and
overall I think it's such a really great
affordable product that is um I don't
use this every day because I do use my
Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre on the daily
but I think this is just such a great
product if you're wanting to clean up
the under eye area and you don't want to
spend a lot of money to do it this is
good last makeup product I'll mention to
you before we get into brushes is there
powder and this is called
their finishing powder and what I like
about it so much is the fact that this
one's a little deep for me this is
actually medium dark and I use this one
to bronze on my skin but what I like
about it so much is the fact that I have
a frog in my throat is that it's like a
finishing powder not really like a
foundation powder so it's not super
heavy you can set your full foundation
with it or you can set your concealer
with it it just doesn't get really cakey
and does have the perfect amount of
coverage my voice is so scratchy
I seriously need somewhat huh okay now
let's talk about brushes you guys ask me
questions all the time on good
affordable makeup brushes and Here I am
with some recommendations for you guys I
don't know why I'm laughing that's not
funny it's kind of funny it's not funny
the first one I mentioned to you I think
this was called yeah this is called the
foundation blurring brush which will be
really great to apply a foundation but
what I really like to use this for is to
apply a bronzer or blush to my skin or
even powder all over the brush it's just
like that perfect size to contour all
those cheekbones it's incredibly soft
and great for the price I highly
recommend this one and then the next one
oh she's trying to run away she better
slow down the next one I want to
recommend to you guys it doesn't have a
name on it so I threw away all the
packages of course but this one I love
for highlighting or if you're going to
like if you have larger eyelids and
would like to blend out a transition
shade would be good for this but I don't
have the biggest eyelids in the world so
I really like to use this one for
applying to highlight is the perfect
size to tickle the nose with it but it's
great and then the next one I'll link
all the stuff down below tooks I know
these brushes don't have names this one
is almost a dupe for the Sigma F 8 Sigma
e25 brush um it's it's so good I love a
blending brush that isn't completely
round it's like flat on the edges like
it's like squished a little because I
feel like I can flick it up and really
get into that crease without getting the
product all over my lid as well just
focusing it on the crease with brushes
like this and elf created one is very
soft and easy to work with next I have a
stippling brush from ELF that I really
like
I like this one poor foundation I don't
typically ever really apply powder so
stippling brushes it's just not the way
I float my boat but I do love this one
for blending out a foundation and I do
like that it's smaller a smaller
stippling brush because I feel like I
majority of the time will draw on my
brows before I do my foundation and I
feel like this brush you can get around
the brow without swiping that sucker off
because we all know if we work so hard
agree to get a brow in this wipe it off
with a foundation brush lo how marks it
is just simple honestly its sinful so I
do love the stippling brush from ELF
it's such a cute little guy my god oh
that's so loud but that is it for my
favorite elf products I hope this you
know helped your tissues on what to buy
from elf I know they have so many
products I love the brand they're
fabulous
I love you guys thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you all in my next
video
