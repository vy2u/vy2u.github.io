video is going to be about foundations
foundations foundations going to talk
about the best high-end and drugstore
foundations on the market I have tried
buku Dulce foundations literally I have
a drawer over there that's like full
foundations and I have broke it down to
like the absolute must-have wants to
spend your money on we're gonna talk
about ones for oily skin dry skin
combination skin normal skin you know I
got you covered
my necklace keeps going in my shirt and
I'm about to stab it
I've eight different foundations to talk
about so I'm gonna try to hit the major
points and when I think about them and
then we'll move on that way we can go
through all of them of you're excited
about the video hope you enjoyed the
video I don't have any announcements for
you guys so we're just gonna jump right
in
let's get started what should the first
foundation be let's talk about let's
talk about one that people talk about
all the time and then we'll move into
the good K so this is one that I was out
to buy this is the Giorgio mornin
Giorgio Armani Nemecek Giorgio Armani a
luminous silk foundation this is a very
full coverage foundation my shade is 5.5
but honestly 5.5 is a little pink for me
like whenever I compared to my neck I'm
kind of olivey a little bit of a yellow
ur skin tone and this one just has to
have a pink undertone so that's my bad
it was a $65 foundation so it's not on
really the affordable fly this one the
best
but it says beautifully on the skin I
don't think it settles into wrinkles and
fine lines which I have a problem with
because I have massive small lines on my
face the foundation sets into that we
got issues I love this a little bit goes
a long way so you have to be careful
with it very full coverage very long
wearing very expensive next let's talk
about a mattifying foundation this is
the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation this is one of them I think
this is one of their best-selling don't
quote me on that but I'm pretty sure I
was hanging out actually hanging out
with L'Oreal I'm so cool I'm pretty sure
they told me that this is one of their
best-selling products this foundation is
long wearing and if you have oily skin
this is gonna be your friend right here
it has that night nice matte finish but
I like the finish because I don't feel
like it's like a cake email like I just
want light matte finish where it looks
so unnatural it kind of allows your skin
to somewhat show through that way you're
not just like make up make up make up
but again you're not gonna get too much
greasy greasy going on with it I
personally like to apply a little all
over my face and then set it with a
mineral powder or not a foundation
powder and we just work out really well
don't we
I'm in shade this is actually the right
shade one caramel beige want to wait
okay the next time is talked about it's
just something that I won't shut up
about on my channel and you guys are
gonna like be like well you stop this is
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
um every single time I wear this
foundation someone asked me what do I
have on my skin because it looks
flawless and I'm like well my scenes not
flawless but thank you very much for
compliment foundation is amazing it is
all free so I think it would be amazing
if you have oily skin is a buildable
foundation so you can wear it kind of
like medium coverage or you can build it
up to full coverage and have a fast dry
time so whenever you have it on your
skin you better get it working honey
blend it out and that i'ma show you San
right now San is a smidge bit dark for
me but I keep wearing San because I want
to believe that my skin is still tan and
it's really not love it it's a pump
bottle pump bottles are my faves this
one's actually empty I have a backup
girl you know I'm ready has no sunscreen
in it so no sun protection in this
foundation which is up but I think it
helps with it not being greasy and being
old free and it is very long wearing so
most of these foundations I mentioned
you you are gonna be long wearing
because that's something I definitely
look for in a foundation the next
foundation I want to mention to you guys
is the brand new one by Becca this is
the aqua luminous perfecting foundation
that is rolled on my tongue like seal
this foundation is cool you turn it it's
like wait how do you feel me so it pops
and then you press the button and the
dropper drops the foundation it's really
neat foundation I'm in shade medium
which matches my skin perfectly the
downside with these just I just don't
think they have enough shades available
only like a few shades so we need more
shades Becca come on girl
those very important tests shake up this
foundation this is aqua luminous meaning
a very wet dewy foundation which I love
love love love I feel like more so in
the winter maybe when my skin's already
I don't know maybe I'm just opposite my
skin's dry in the winter so I just offer
heavier makeup maybe like the matte but
like in this summer I just want to look
do P um so this gives me that really
nice dewy finish if you have oily skin I
don't recommend this foundation for you
because I think you're good to end of
the day you're gonna end up looking more
wet than dewy just because of the oles
skin plus the like luminous aqua glow
that it gives you but if you have dry
skin or normal skin this is gonna be
your shebang if you like that to eat
glow the next foundation is a new one at
the drugstore this is the L'Oreal True
Match cushion foundation this is the
lumi so this is another one that i don't
necessarily recommend for oily skin my
sister sometimes has always compared to
me my sister talk makeup so much so i
bring her up a lot on my channel
she has somewhat only skin and she loves
the louise foundation but at the end of
the day it is somewhat greasy fide so
like i said i recommend the pro matte if
you're having that issue but if you
don't really have that issue I recommend
this I love it in this form I threw away
the sponge just cuz I wasn't feeling it
but I like to just dab my Beauty Blender
and it like once like and then dab it
all over my face and it gives a really
nice finish I personally don't like to
build this one up because I feel like it
gets too wet on my face whenever I'm
trying to build up this foundation um I
just feel like it's not meant to be that
full coverage I feel like it's meant to
be more of a medium coverage foundation
and I'm okay with that so that's what I
try to wear it as but it's an awesome
foundation I'm in shade in 3.5 and I
haven't even told you guys yet I am dry
I'm combination skin I'm pretty much dry
but right here on my face so grazie
it will be like wet
the next time they shall want to mention
to you guys I've seen all over YouTube
and personally I think I've seen on
YouTube for a good reason because this
is a good foundation
honestly the foundation scared me a
little bit at first because I'm not a
stick person which that that came out
weird I'm not a person who likes stick
make up I'm more so like a liquid
foundation girl so when this came out I
was kind of like I'm not gonna like it I
saw how many people liked it so I was
like okay I have to try it out and I did
and it comes off the stick almost like a
liquid like it's weird how creamy it is
it isn't gonna be like that cakey like
makeup that's impossible to blend out
it's really easy to blend out I normally
do let me think like two --stripe
--stripe --stripe --stripe my face and
this is definitely a buildable
foundation I'm in shade 155 maybe
forever has buku Dulce shades to choose
from so that is a plus side with makeup
forever I tell me I'm like sweating I
have a full sweat mustache we're gonna
pretend like it's not there but as their
next foundation that I kind of neglected
and forgot about because it wasn't my
shade for a long time and I was - I just
didn't feel like buying more of it but
now it's my shade again and so now I'm
gonna start loving you again and I've
been where I fit on right now I've been
wearing out every single day so this is
Stromboli and this is there all day
luminous weightless foundation by NARS
this came out last year and it was a big
bang but I saw a lot of negative
negative reviews on it and let me tell
you why because I actually went to NARS
on Melrose and I talked to the girls
there about it because I was like tell
me how you would use this let's say I'm
a customer I walk in I have no idea how
to use this tell me what's going wrong
she was like everybody is doing it like
any other foundation just pumping out
two to three pumps and putting all over
the face and then it creases and it's
only and it's heavy and you're supposed
to use one pump on your face and the
pump is tiny let me show you that's all
you get for your whole entire face do
you see that that's crazy but believe it
or not there's so much pigment and color
in this town
nation they by the time you blend it out
it truly covers your whole face and it
looks like full-coverage foundation so a
little bit goes a long way so in my
opinion you get your money's worth with
this foundation I'm in shade medium
three Stromboli and Norris does have a
good arrangement of shades they're
always really good about that as well
honestly if you just use a little bit of
it it doesn't sink into your wrinkle
your wrinkles and your smile lines or
you know any fine lines that you have
it's not gonna seep into it if you use
it right if you put on too much and try
to build it up no girl right now this is
my everyday foundation it lasts
foundation I have to talk to you guys
about that I just cannot neglect so good
this is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD I
wonder am i I don't know how I'm in two
different shades in the same foundation
something's going wrong here but this is
I'm in shade why three eight five so
this is just a tried and true foundation
and I personally think that it's best
for photography like if it's your
wedding day you're gonna have pictures
made it is actually what this foundation
was made for it's like studio filming a
good foundation for that so I give it a
lot of questions on what foundation you
wearing your wedding prom etc make it
forever Ultra HD is where it's at this
is super liquidy I'd apply this with a
Beauty Blender with my kabuki blush you
can really apply this however you want
to with your fingers if you want to but
just make sure you wash your hand this
is a good foundation you can build it up
totally buildable all the way up to full
coverage if you want to and just a
reminder like I personally shake all my
foundations before I use them and I
think everybody should just give it a
good shake unless you don't shake this
come on we know better in a good shake
to mix up that formula but just a set
and I think the formula is break apart
in the bottle so you just want to yeah
yeah another thing I really like about
this foundation if you don't build it up
too high it can look really natural
where your skin can kind of Pierce it's
a foundation where you just don't look
too cakey like it looks like you're
wearing makeup but you also looks like
you beautiful skin radiating through the
makeup so all-around amazing foundation
for a wholly dry or normal or come often
times it's good for all skin types and
long wearing okay guys that is it for
