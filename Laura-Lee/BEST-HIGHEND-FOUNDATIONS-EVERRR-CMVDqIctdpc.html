video is going to be me talking about
luxury foundations or was a $1 bills now
on my channel if you're looking for a
more affordable foundation I have done
multiple videos discovering great
affordable foundations so just know
those videos are out there these are
about high-end foundations that I think
are fabulous and with your dollar I'm
going to be talking about sheer coverage
full coverage matte finish you know
glossy finish well not a glossy pelant's
a glossy finish foundation luminous
finish foundation so I have quite a
range actually have a whole lot to talk
to you guys about but what is oh my god
my background so girl I'm gonna get it
together one day y'all but anyways
dead-ass serious
these are something that just really
worked for me so I want to share with
you guys and let you know good good also
be sure to subscribe to my channel

where I'm giving away all this and
makeup to one lucky winner and all you

announce the winner in the description
of this video so you can come back and
listen the description box and you'll
see the winner
I'll pick randomly in about two days or
so so anyways we're going to go ahead
and jump right in and get started let's
do it
okay um geez where to begin I literally
have a lot to talk about with you guys
so I guess we'll start with a newer one
for me this is the Giorgio Armani a
powder fabric long wear high coverage
foundation has SPF 20 in it I like what
my foundations have sunscreen and all
because it protects your skin throughout
the day you don't realize how much fun
your face is picking up through windows
to government car they walk into the
mail like in a day after day or today it
can cause wrinkles okay its skin cancer
this is a very high coverage makeup and
it finishes is completely mess so you
have to make sure you get your right
shade in this a good way to get your
shade online is to Google swatches of
the foundation and a lot of time
bloggers will swatch each shade you get
like a real look at what foundation
might be good for you if you buy it at
Sephora Sephora always has a really
great return policy too if it's not the
right show you can use it
still return it so if you like a matte
finish and I'm talking like matte finish
you're going to love this and it's super
full coverage so it's very long wearing
as well I mean it's just like it's
exactly what it says is it doesn't get
grieves me on your skin it doesn't start
to slip off it doesn't get patchy it's
easy to blend out and I recommend it to
you the next foundation is an oldie for
everyone but me because I just now
started to wear it because I'm on the
late bus this is the Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation I think that this is a
great really long wearing everyday full
coverage foundation Super Bowl coverage
but great for everyday because it
doesn't clip off again in it where so
long it's very buildable I think you
could potentially get a little bit of a
medium coverage out of this if you went
light with it or if you applied a lot of
products it's definitely going to be
full coverage but it definitely wears so
incredibly long so it's fabulous for
every day where you wear it to work and
it wanted me to crazy and it doesn't
have a completely matte finish it has a
semi matte I would say you know a little
bit of luminosity with in it I would say
it's like flat matte makeup you know you
got a little bit of glow I hate that it
doesn't have a pump on it but hopefully
I don't know why I feel like a waste a
lot of product by dumping it on my hand
and then dabbing it and these are pricey
products so we don't want to be wasting
an ending product okay so I definitely
recommend this to you guys honey is
worth that hot dollar guys the next one
I want recommend to you guys is
something that I recently reviewed for
you guys so if you want to see a full
review I'll link it down below but it is
the matte next to nothing foundation and
you're like oh my gosh it's finally
talking about something that's not super
full coverage I read the comment section
actually I'm like so a BDMS all over the
place on the video read the comment
section I would surprised to see how
many people love a good really sheer
foundation that just adds a little
little little little bit of coverage
even out skin tone and a bit of color to
your skin and that's exactly what this
does so for my peeps out there that are
not full covered gals this is great for
you it has a pump
faces I'm in shade medium dark just
because out a little bit of a tan right
now typically I'm not quite this dark in
the shade but it wears long wearing and
blend it out easy
manjae's what wasn't it it wasn't full
coverage very sheer showed up my skin
beautifully at it like just like a soft
filter over my skin and like that was it
you know and it didn't get patchy didn't
clean the dry spot I didn't get a grease
puddle on my forehead with it so it was
all over a great foundation um I would
say it still feels whatever you put it
on like the Studio Fix Foundation Mac so
it's not watery and just feels like a
waste of money like it's nothing it
still feels like a good foundation
moving right along is one I haven't
really talked about on my channel
because I talked about so much
affordable makeup on my channel I like
to sometimes you know talk about Bobby
Brown hey I'm have some hitting this
products of Bobby Brown but I've also
you know had some hints some I showed
this hit with you this is the moisture
rich foundation it has SPF 15 in it and
this is I think such a great product for
mature skin you know I'm in my 20s and I
still think it's a great product for me
it looks so beautiful on the skin if you
have Olli skin I do not recommend this
to you it has a lot of moisture in it so
I think it could potentially leave you a
little bit greasy but if you have dry
skin who honey it is so pretty
and luminous on dry skin and also
because it doesn't have that super matte
finish I think it looks great on mature
skin because it doesn't settle into
wrinkle and it doesn't like emphasize
the wrinkles it just has that really
natural finish to it so this is a great
foundation to actually don't ever hear
talked about on the internet but I loved
it oh oh my god I love this do the next
one I'm going to talk about is something
that I mentioned in my underrated
products video because I just don't hear
this one talked about enough you know
and this one is a hit and miss with some
people but I love it it has a very
interesting formula to it it's a gel
like formulas have like a strange smell
that I'm obsessed with it's not like a
good flower reason it's just like a
weird smell but I'm telling it it looks
really pretty on my skin again this one
gives you a little bit of a natural
finish medium coverage doesn't settle in
the wrinkles I have tremendous small
lines I don't have any filler in my face
filler my lips but not anywhere else on
my face so the smile lines are there and
it is something that I battle with
foundations and I will put a powder to
set but this one I sign it is so
fabulous for everyday wear this is also
another one that's great for useful skin
but I also think it's great for mature
skin as well and it's definitely worth
your money it comes in a pot so being
mindful I know most people measure their
foundations like a pump or two wears
this you could scoop out a glob and I
realize that you're using way too much
so just be mindful with it in that so
you definitely get your money's worth in
the foundation I'm in light medium honey
shade they have quite a few shades in it
I think this one's exclusive to Ulta so
the great foundation I have talked about
it for so long let me just stop the next
thing I'm going to talk about is I think
this is like if you don't really do in
the whole concealer foundation the whole
moment if you're like a one product kind
of girl this products for you because
it's a foundation plus concealer and
I've used it in that way I'm in shade
number eight and this one's very warm
tone but I think it's pretty this is a
full coverage foundation but because
it's full coverage you can use it as a
concealer as well so what I'll do is
I'll put it over my face and add just a
couple more dots under my eyes to blend
that out and you kind of get into in one
because it is the same shade as your
face and you're using like a concealer
it's not going to highlight or brighten
the other eye but it will cover the dark
circles so if you're one of those people
who are like I am NOT trying to use 15
products in one we gots to go this is a
good foundation to you to use it is full
coverage again Mehmedi settle in the
wrinkles because I'm not about that life
and it has this interesting doe foot
applicator on it which I kind of love it
just makes it very easy to apply the
product and you don't ever waste any of
the product maybe a little bit matte
finish but somewhat natural not too
cakey looking and it's just very
beautiful on the skin and long wearing
and full coverage next up is one that
I've actually been using for a few years
now and this is one of the first
foundations that I really splurt this I
think is the first foundations that I
really splurged
and I was like okay we're going to bed
this is CG or skin and this one has SPF
15 in it and this one kind of sort of
reminds me of the tarte one because it's
almost like a gel like formula to it
just a super interesting formula I am in
shade zero three zero and Tyler's mom
and me went to Sephora and she was a
what's a good foundation for everyday
use and again mature skin and I love my
girl and she fell in love with it youth
her whole entire bottle like it was
nothing it has a lightweight feel to it
even though it has sunscreen in it and
it's medium coverage and I find it as
long wearing and I've learned this a few
times and people have asked me you know
what it's not your skin because it looks
so pretty because it almost gives you a
little bit of a luminosity glow wear so
well yes Carl yes you love that the
labeling is taking off because I've been
traveling with this and wearing it so
much okay and last but not least is a
product I've talked about so many times
on my channel that's why I saved it for
last because I know I'm kind of beating
a dead horse here like we get it we get
it you love it this is the hourglass
Vantage foundation and it's home movie
ohmy it comes in a little triangle too
and believe it or not is actually last
me a long time I probably use way more
of it than you're supposed to use but it
definitely has a matte finish you need
to set it where it potentially could
kind of set in your smile line and I am
in the same shade beige but it looks so
good and girl the coverage is unreal
this is a super super full coverage non
greasy long wearing foundation it is
very easy to blend out and it all comes
in a stick so people get skeptical on
the blending of it but this one is
incredibly easy to blend out again
because it's so full coverage and like
matte finish be sure and get the right
shade for you or else you will be able
to tell because the pigmentation and the
color and the product is strong but this
is what I Instagram full beat honey yes
I'm here to slay foundation this is it
and you can also mix this with other
foundations like if you put on a medium
coverage foundation and
you're like okay I'm a little extra
coverage here you can take this stick
and like and blend it out and we give
you extra coverage in those areas we
stick together and I travel with it a
lot because not in a glass bottle and
it's not going to break and TSA it's not
going to be like it's on my plan and
that is all my foundations I told you
guys that allow them to talk about the
minute around one two three four five
six seven eight foundations girl well I
recommend that you buy all of these I'm
just saying I try to decipher and tell
you the finishes and the coverages and
how they look on dry skin or all the
skins to you guys we can see which one
is right for you I hope this video was
helpful and I hope it gave you some
insight on a new luxury foundation if
you're looking for one or that is worth
your Monday I love you guys so much
thank you for being here and watching be
sure and subscribe to my channel okay
anyways guys because my neck has
something so dark in my videos I have
this like piece of white foam just
sitting in front of my face and it's
