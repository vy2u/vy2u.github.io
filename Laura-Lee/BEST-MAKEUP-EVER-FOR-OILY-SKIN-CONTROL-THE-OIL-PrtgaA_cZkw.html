to be talking about Olli skin first
we're gonna address the way that I say
the word Olli no I do not pronounce it
correctly yes I am from the south and
now I will not fix the way I pronounce
it because I like the way I talk yeah
ninety percent of you guys already know
that and you have adapted to my southern
slang Oh in today's video I literally
the requests the tweets the comments the
posts the I mean like I would say
majority my questions is old a skin what
to do about it what products are great
for what foundation is great for what
powder is great for what primer is great
for constant questions is always back to
only skin so I wanted to do a dedicated
video and talking about products that
are simply great for ollie
for oily skin I have pretty normal skin
my forehead however in this area I just
went ahead and set with some powder you
see the old re trying come back that's
not a highlighter that's a little bit
grease trying to come back I just put
powder on it and it's already trying to
play me because I've been hot and
working on videos all day long so
sometimes my face gets crazy and I found
quite a few products those really helped
me out with that
yes I'm itching my hair right now and
yes that is kind of gross and I want to
talk to you guys about it and really
want to help you guys out and suggest
some things I do have some drugstore
products I have high end products so
it's quite a range of things to help you
guys out and yeah we're gonna do that
today I have any announcements other
than less Chitty Chitty chat chat I love
talking to you guys so talking videos
are always fun let's go ahead and sing a
little song before we can start it be
sure and subscribe to my channel and
we'll go ahead and
alright first things first I want to
talk about a little bit of Olli skincare
and because it all starts with skincare
you know so I have to face washes that I
really like the first ones by origins I
recently started using it is zero oil it
is a deep pore cleansing product and I
really feel like in the summer time
especially when it's hot we're going
through a heatwave right now I get
really greasy and I really feel like
this helps to clean out the pores and
when the pores are clean I feel like you
get less all so with that being said I
really have been enjoying this product I
don't feel like it's a gimmick I truly
feel like it works it is a little bit
pricey it's by origins but it is an
awesome face wash also I have another
one and now here is the thing about this
one I think it's really really really
good for oily skin but at the same time
I think this one is hydrating so if you
feel like your skin is Olli but dry at
the same time which is definitely a
thing you know you still have to give
your sim moisture regardless of its
producing grease or not I like the hydro
boost hydrating gel cleanser this is a
really awesome cleanser this is my
second bottle of it by the way from
Neutrogena I keep it in my bathroom and
use it all the time because my skin or
my face and stuff will still get dry
despite me having Olli patches and
having all day skin so I really been
enjoying this and the best thing is it's
affordable so those are 2 face washes
that are awesome blossom now let's talk
about some moisturizers that are great
for oily skin I actually like 90
different gel moisturizers I adore I'm
like a gel moisturizer connoisseur I
highly recommend you getting a gel
moisturizer I cannot tell you how many
people have told me that changing from
cream to gel moisturizer has saved their
skin and saved their life and completely
changes the game from them and I promise
you if you have only skin and you can
just flip it from cream to a gel it does
not mean you are taking away moisture it
just means you're clogging last pores a
lot of cream moisturizers are heavy they
cost millions the little white clog
bombs like whiteheads on the skin it's
just too heavy for your skin John
moisturizers find that they are so
lightweight but yet give you the same
amount of moisture into your skin
leaving your skin looking beautiful but
not clogged up and avoiding breakouts
using this so
two of my favorites the first was the
ginseng won by origins origins again I
didn't realize I was talking about them
again but I've been using this stuff
forever it's so good dealer also makes a
blue one that I've been obsessed with
and then one they have two of the
drugstore love I love the hydro boost
gel moisturizer my Neutrogena I don't
have it on hand I use all that I have
but next up the Garnier our skin active
moisture balm is a total to dupe tube
for aqua balm at Sephora this is like
100 percent of dupe and the Aqua balm at
Sephora is amazing like life-changing
but so is this is like the exact same
thing and now Garnier Fructis came out
with one again moisture balm so if
you're looking for an affordable one I
really recommend this guy to you it can
totally change your skin plus I'm not
mistaken the smell so good
woah smells so good even looks like
moisture ROM in the container next let's
jump into makeup let's let's do it so
first let's talk about I'm gonna talk
about some primers first one that I
really really really love is the Natasha
and Alma Natasha
de noona prime it is a magic primer I'm
not just making that up guys it says
magic primer but it is so good for anti
shine and I find it like I just want to
deal with a lot of the shine that comes
through especially right here girl I
look almost wet right there at the end
of a day if I don't touch it
up at all but this really helps that I
like to like press it into the skin and
really massage it in there like and then
the forehead kind of like massage it and
I find that it really holds back to
shine are you gonna be shine free for
nine hours no but I find that you have
way less shine and you're more so you
have less shine longer as well so this
it helps it's not a miracle you're not
gonna have no shine forever the rest of
your life you use this but it definitely
helps control the shine next um ooh
pores no more this is such a good primer
this is from dr. Brandt and it actually
absorbs the OL out of your skin and it
works
it also mattifies the skin so well and
it fills in the big poor areas too so if
you're having a lot of
shrim big pores on your skin this will
fill it in it's kind of like a filling
putty and then you put your foundation
on top of it so it's like a double
double whammy it has all three great
things in it this is such a good product
I want to show it to you that Natasha no
one is like white and clear this one is
this one looks more skin colored and
then it just feels very velvety on the
skin you can literally fill it fill in
the pores the interesting product but it
works it also smells very medicated and
really strong but it helps with the OL
until I'm yeah it just helps okay all
right let's talk about some foundation
products have three that I'm going to
talk about I could talk about more but
if you like three is good so we won't
have a 45-minute video the first one is
the new Laura Mercier flawless fusion
ultra long wear foundation and the thing
that I have found about this foundation
is if you have oily skin I find that
foundation should I play you a little
bit and they'll be sloughing off it's
hard to keep your makeup on whenever is
only because it wants to slip and slide
around this foundation well I remember I
wore this foundation for 12 hours I went
to a friend's house
no touch-ups at all and my friend said
your makeup look so pretty you must have
just done it to come over here what are
you wearing and I was like this is so
old like I was like it's so old I can't
imagine what I looked like and Julie it
looks flawless and I was wearing this
foundation and I've been wearing it
quite a lot lately and it's just so
beautiful and it will not leave your
skin regardless of how old your skin
gets it will not it just hangs in there
it's like on your skin so if you need a
long wear foundation that old can't even
bust through this is your guy right here
also one of my tried and true favors
I've talked about 15 million times in my
channel is the matte and poreless from
maybelline this guy right here is a
medium coverage foundation great for
everyday use and is specifically made
for oily skin I find that it isn't too
matte where it looks cakey or fake on
your skin it's just matte enough and it
really it doesn't control the whole but
it really helps to kick back because of
the finish of the foundation
and lastly I just recently test this
product out and I sort of fell in love
with it is this the peach perfect
comfort mat cushion this is an all free
14 hour we're all controlling
photo-friendly
product this is like a this is our new
foundation but it it's it's I was a
sheared of medium coverage very
lightweight on the skin and it made my
skin very matte also by the way it's
just super super map but it also made my
skin look very velvety and beautiful and
it smells really good and it lasted for
a long time this is specifically made
for people with oily skin and it works
it is so so good all right so really
important when it comes to oily skin is
powders nose we're talking about a lot
of face makeup here but we're also gonna
talk about eye primers tubes I know
people have Oly eyelids face primers
alright I mean face powders well first
is the welder the welder is such a
genius product I fell in love with this
product because actually a glossy err
contacted me and said hey we're coming
out with a new powder we would love for
you to try it and if you watch all my
videos you know in the past they have
sponsored me on this product but this
video isn't sponsored on this product I
got to try it out before it even
launched so I couldn't even talk about I
lost try out and I fell madly deeply in
love with the product and I use it
almost every day now I travel with it
the whole bit they have three shades in
it I use the lightest ones like
light/medium and how I use it I don't
bake or like press it into my skin I get
a little bit on my brush it's like a net
in there you tap a little bit goes a
long way like I'll just go and then I
rub it on my skin do you see how the
softest skin looks it literally will
turn your skin into pure velvet like no
matter how shiny it is
it just turns it to straight velvet oh
and you can pop it right on top of your
foundation to really lock your
foundation in set it it doesn't feel
heavy it doesn't look cakey it doesn't
flash back with a camera it is all
around a genius product next another
really genius product the only thing is
this one does flash back a little bit
but let's be real if you are not taking
pictures we don't all do a photo shoot
every day with the flash you'll totally
be
okay this is the it cause I'm breathing
it in this is the it cosmetics this is
there bye-bye pores translucent powder
and it is some heavy duty ish I kind of
have it exploits it's messy okay it's
messy it looks like I'm doing drugs over
here it's not good but it works it is by
my pores so is a photo finish micro
powder in it it's super super super
mattifying if you're gonna be wearing
makeup for like nine hours you have no
chance for a touch-up life stuff man I
get it
you need to get this stuff and put it
all over your face because it will lock
your makeup down and the OL can barely
peep through this they're always gonna
have to fight this like Mayweather and
McGregor that's what kind of battle is
gonna be going on in your face because
this stuff is so freakin powerful it's
almost too powerful for me because my
hair cut by my skin is normal in some
areas but I'm talk about if you're
dealing with a real oily situation it
cosmetics has got great products for
only skin and this is definitely one of
them and I recommend it to you guys
lastly if you were tight on a budget and
you need a product that works this is
one that I've always just gone to it is
the Rimmel stay matte it's very nice I
actually like to keep this one in my
purse and if my forehead and all is
getting crazy hey stay down I'll just
whip out a little sponge a little beauty
bin or blender a little brush and just
pop this on my skin and it's very
hopeful you can also set your whole face
with this after you get them putting on
your foundation because it's a
lightweight powder and it does not flash
back with the camera okay okay lastly
let's oh no I have a setting spray this
is a new search for a thing I don't know
if it's new sometimes there's make that
up is it new I don't know
anyways this is the kerf FX mattifying
setting spray do I feel like this is
like a miracle product no but I feel
like sometimes setting sprays like the
mac fix+ or the tatcha luminous dewy
they add doing this into the skin and
sometimes you're just born with a
natural doing this and that is called
all and you don't need all that jazz so
this is something that just does not add
that do enos it's set your makeup but it
doesn't add that
shimmer and shine and glow it keeps it
matte and I wouldn't say this is like
gonna keep you matte all day and fix all
your problems no but so many things
spray is added doing this that you don't
need but this one for sure will not if I
can explain it that way to you guys and
it will help you out okay lastly I have
three eyeshadow primers to talk to you
guys about the first one is missing in
action oh here it is okay the Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre Mac Paint Pots in
general the ones that don't have shimmer
in it are such a tough Paint Pot that
will lock down your I show I know Olli
I'll it's a real thing infecting this
world and we're gonna fix it okay we're
gonna fix it today right here right now
this is a Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
and it is game changing yeah also these
products dry out to my Mac sometimes
they dry out before you can use it all I
do get like a hundred uses out of it but
if it's dry out don't try to put on your
eyes because it just gets chunky and
really hard to blend out but um this is
and I mean it's just absolutely amazing
absolutely amazing as your primer that
will lock it down and control that whole
next is the 24 hour photo finish shadow
primer by Smashbox if you're not into
the Mac products this Smashbox got right
here girl it works so good and it's not
too tacky so also your eyeshadows are
still very blendable with this product
it's genius and it works I know so many
people that depend on this every single
day because it's just a genius product
and lastly I never talked about this
brand and I feel like this brands like I
don't know what this brand is doing okay
but I never talked about them but I got
to talk about them the Mary Kay
eyeshadow primer base but let me warn
you before you go in on willy nilly and
buying this stuff it is glue but all
can't get past it
if you have all the eyelids the Mary Kay
I show base is like the toughest I show
up on market the only double edged sword
I see with it is you have a little might
have a little bit of trouble blending
out your eyeshadow with it because it's
very very tacky but ole can't get past
it so I mean your eyeshadows gonna be
good with it and it's a good eye shadow
primer you know so those are that and
that is this and that is the products
that I hope will help you out as you
guys know everything I mention will be
listed in the description box
I'm below so you can just find all that
stuff down below I love you guys to
death I'm so happy you're here with me
and I will see you all in my next video
because the video is over we just ended
it kind of abruptly but it's over I love
you so much
and I'll be on an amazing day subscribe
