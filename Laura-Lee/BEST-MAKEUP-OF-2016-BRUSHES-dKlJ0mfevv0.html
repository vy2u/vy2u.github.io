video is going to be my a mystery
shopping oh my good girl okay today's
video is going to be my favorites of
2016 and what I try to do in this video
is mostly mention my favorite products
that kind of launched in 2016 not just
like my holy girl makeup products
because I've totally done that video
before and if I'm not careful I'll just
go pick out my favorite things of the
year and it will be like my Holy Grail
products but I really wanted to focus
this video on things that are amazing
that launched this year watched yeah um
okay we'll jump right in and get started
be sure and subscribe to my channel
before you leave oh and yeah let's get
started starting out with I am going to
go over brushes torch the end so hang in
till the end if you want to hear out
makeup brushes I think are great so
let's just start with facial primers you
know since that's kind of how I store my
makeup there are three that I love this
therefore that I love this year first
it's the NYX hydro touch if you have dry
skin and your skin needs a little bit of
love a little bit moisture ization
without clogging your pores this one is
amazing and it's affordable by the way
I'm gonna talk fast and move on cuz I
don't want a 30 minute video girl I
can't even do it can't even do it next
one is the Natasha adult the de Tasha de
nonne a prime magic primer this is
probably one of the best primers out
there on the market it is so cool it's
definitely there to help all control and
I feel like it does such a great job of
smoothing out my skin and getting it
ready and prepped for my foundation and
casey holmes is the one who actually
bought this for me but she introduced me
to it as well the next one that launched
this year that i thought is just
fabulous is the pore vanishing stick
from si edit and i know this was a big
bang for them this year it is so amazing
i'll just color on right through here
where my pores are larger and put my
foundation on top of it oh girl it works
very well very effective and then this
one i'm pretty sure that didn't launch
this year when i'm going to mention it
anyways because it's oh it's worth
owning it is the tarte clean slate
timeless smoothing primer and
it's the same thing I just smooth it in
areas I feel like it's like a putty then
I'm just filling in the pores and that
way my foundation just lays flawlessly
on top of it it is amazing you eyeshadow
palette I've three eyeshadow palettes
that I love this year and of course you
guys know I'm going to mention my
palette but how could I not that's kind
of effed up if I didn't write this is
back in stock by the way we brought it
back for the holiday season I'll have it
linked down below but this is the boss
palette that I created and I've used it
and used it and used it I love it I
think it's great and yeah she's the bomb
I won't touch too much on it because you
guys know I talk a lot about it a lot
next one the launch this year that I
think it's prom in Los is the huda
beauty palette I think it's so pretty I
know people out there have been like
there's so many mixed reviews but I
don't know why there's mixed reviews I
like the colors and I think that the
mats are great I think it's really
unique because it has like these foiled
pigments in it which you don't see an
eyeshadow palette and they're amazing I
was applying with my finger and it works
out great and I really like the color
combination that she has going in this
palette this is something I could pack
and do my complete makeup with this
palette alone sometimes a palettes I
love them but they don't have every
color that I need and so I had to pack
multiple palettes when traveling but
this is like a good to go palette and
this one I think had one of the biggest
booms this year I hope it's in stock
probably not maybe it'll come back but
this is the modern renaissance palette
by Anastasia Beverly Hills and I use the
hell about her warm tone colors are just
it right now I mean warmth home warm
tone worn home this is like the warm
tone color palette besides the morphe
35o which is another great one randomly
talked about lips next I'm all over the
place favorite lippy it would be I'm
nude by Jeffrey star this was my
favorite liquid lipstick of the year I
went through three of them and it is
just the perfect nude I don't like my
nude stuff like this warm orange
undertone or a pink undertone it's just
got to be like perfect and this is like
my go-to nude and then I also recently
more so recently discovered a lipstick
that I can't put down I'm wearing it in
the center of my lips right now this is
buf and this is by maybelline it's super
affordable drugstore 1 maybelline i
guess recently launched a bunch of their
nude lip e's and this one's a little bit
matte it's so good if you can 5 540
peach but buff you better grab them all
and then leave one for me at the
drugstore and then as you weigh which i
think is pretty much responsible for
kind of creating that lip topper frenzy
this year they first came out with
skinny dip which is actually my favorite
out of all of them and they kind of
brought back glosses for us I feel like
it was liquid lipstick liquid lipstick
liquid lipstick and then we got into
metallic liquid lipsticks and now we're
really jumping back into the shiny lip
and these are just foiled for your lips
they're back in stock I think now they
might be sold out again but she had a
hard time keeping these in stock but
hopefully they are back and then she
came bout with tan lines more of a
bronzey one I just want to pay my whole
face with it so I look like a bronze
goddess but it probably wouldn't turn
out that way then this winner she came
out with frostbite which is a really
nice snowy wintery color that is
beautiful you just pop it these are
great
the first single eyeshadow is morphe
they came out with these pressed
pigments everything I talked about in
the back of my head I'm like oh god
please be in stock because I totally
didn't check before I film this video
this one's called hi class hi it's like
golden goddess extreme these are so
pigmented and of course they're more
feasts and you already know they have a
great price tag on them please be in
stock the next single shadow that it
shows everything to me is get lucky I
think this one's been around for a while
from colour-pop these are only 5 dollars
a piece and this eyeshadow is such a
nice gold because I feel like it's like
more of a white light gold than a yellow
gold this one's more of like that bronze
e goddess yellow Goldy color and this is
more of a soft light gold color which is
still very beautiful and make that
eyelid hot let's talk about facial
powders because they're not that
interesting but Lord knows we all need
them my favorite facial powder that
launched in 2016 my favorite loose
powder of all time has been the cover FX
perfect setting powder I like it because
it doesn't have talc in it it doesn't
flash back if you're taking a picture
the camera
it absorbs your all and it does a great
job baking so it's an all-in-one I use
translucent light and it's just like
that right consistency as well and I
like that it has this pop open lid so it
doesn't explode powder everywhere every
time you open it hmm all right let's
talk about highlights over I think
highlights biggest year was this year I
mean I feel like the year 2016 was all
about your highlight better be popping
honey well I have to say you guys saw me
use this one over and over and over and
over and this one is conceded by artist
couture this is a little mini one my big
one is like somewhere I don't know where
this Couture diamond glow powder czar so
beautiful every single time I wear them
someone asked girl what are you wearing
but they are literally very pigmented
they blend out really softly on the skin
there's a great arrangement of colors to
pick from
I like concede it because I think it
just complements my skin tone the most
as a highlighter who would I be without
mention make some champagne pop girl
champagne popping this highlight did
this launch in 2016 I may be wrong I'm
probably wrong this was not it was this
is 2015 product huh it's beautiful
months through have been through the
rough she's been used a little bit I
need a little bit of a right now
champagne popping by Jacqueline Hill and
Becca cosmetics mascaras this is gonna
be fun because I have a bunch so my
boobs been out the whole video that's
great
it'll get a lot of screen shots first
I'll start off with these two I really
love these look how disgusting this
one's been she's been traveling with me
a lot this is the falsies push-up drama
mascara i subscriber actually
recommended this to me and it's because
my lashes I know they look like they're
full now but okay they're fake but I
really like this one because I feel like
it lifted my lashes that grow out
straight and then they came out with the
push-up angel and I have the one on it's
weird I hear you but I feel like it
grabs my bottom lashes like snatches
those suckers up like and then I feel
like it you can get right at the base
like dig up in there they're both great
and I do recommend to you the next one
was to make it for our excessive lash I
feel like this one too it just the wand
on
so simple - it's smaller though so it
doesn't make a big mess on your eyelid
or your lower lashline but I feel like
the actual product the mascara itself is
fabulous it grabs the lashes it dries
quick it doesn't get chunky like it's
just everything I wanted mascara and
then my last one is I've talked about
this so much my Marc Jacobs velvet
anymore I reviewed this so long ago my
channel shoe so that means it didn't
come out in 2016
girl I don't know I'm all over the place
get your together such a good
mascara this is what I use to normally
connect my real lashes to my fake lashes
by doing this isn't dry or chunky it's
just really easy to put on your lashes
and a lot comes off the brush and next
is for a blush and pop it on peach blush
it's been one my favorites my favorite
blush every year is a peach blush it's
just like it is like my go-to kind of
thing for blush I love the peachy on my
skin tone and probably don't peach blush
oh it smells like peaches it hasn't this
nice little Sheen to it where it looks
like I'm glowing and really healthy nice
polished look on my skin and not only
that is the shade peach which is like
the faves on my scan I love it and then
let's talk about contour so this is a
newer product that came out in 2016 and
I hope Matt keeps it around if you don't
I will come for you actually when I was
with Mac in New York last month I was
like hi I love this product you should
keep it but this is the quick trick
stick and it is like a contour and
highlighting stick I know NARS has a
good one as well but just a color on it
so good this is a lot a sheen and
semi-sweet and it is such a great nice
cool tone color that doesn't look too
gray but doesn't have that orange
undertone and they blend out like butter
they're so easy to cream contour with so
I think this is a great beginners
product they're awesome up to
foundations that are really been loving
this year one of them ty is going to
have to hand to me because it's all the
way over there and I forgot to grab it
no ty one of my favorite foundations of
the year is the hour
I finish foundation whenever I'm in
front of the camera or I'm doing a photo
shoot or whatever life may bring to me I
want a full coverage foundation but I
hate the feeling of full coverage
foundations I hate that heavy goopy
makeup filling and this is a brand new
one for me I'm in shade beige by the way
this one's fresh it is seriously so
lightweight but gets so full coverage
another foundation that has just been
fabulous for me is the dream cushion by
Maybelline this one actually launches in
January this year but it was sent to me
in the beginning of December so I've
been wearing it on and off for a month
and I've really been enjoying it you
guys know that Maybelline fit me and
matte and poreless is one my favorite
foundations from Maybelline but this one
it hasn't replaced it but it's a close
second it's a great drugstore affordable
foundation I am the shade I think
natural beige I cannot find it right now
I think it's in my travel bag I just got
back from visiting Alabama but this is
medium beige in is one shade too dark
for eyeliner I've been pretty much using
my same old same old liquid liner from
NYC but I do have a new this is the
Estee Lauder X Victoria Beckham and this
is a dual din eyeliner and it is the
creamiest eyeliner and then it gives you
a little playtime and then it dries
solid I have two black in my waterline
and then there's a vanilla in so you get
like the the light wearable color to
widen your eye or the black sultry color
if that's what you are all in one pencil
and they're both the best eyeliners I
think I've ever used so I highly
recommend this guy Barr's brow products
of course you guys know I have to
mention to mom stop texting me precisely
my brow pencil I am in shade for
probably should go up to a3 since I line
in my ends but this is a great great
brow pencil which I know launched this
year and it is amazing and they have a
good I think you know arrangement of
colors to choose from so your brows
won't be looking funky far as brushes go
I just wanted to mention a couple to you
guys I know more if you recently came
out with this set and I think you get
eyes and face brushes for 40 bucks and a
little case to carry them in and so I
get asked all the
what's a good deal on brushes or what
should I order off the morphe site now
they have their elite collection which i
think is fabulous they're a little bit
more pricey but then they came out with
these and I've been playing with them
they these are a recent by the way and
they come with they're all in my brush
thing these are not all of them but I
just want to show you what they look
like and I think they're great quality a
handle and some are really lightweight
so it's not like that sturdy heavy-duty
makeup handle and maybe that's where
they were able to cut the cost the
actual quality of the brush is great and
I really been enjoying these plus I
think they're cute as a button
Sigma came out with like they're
strobing kit and these are some of my
favorite brushes out of that kit these
brushes desk desperately need it to be
you know for us invented here on this
planet first is they conceal and blend
and then this is like a mini kabuki
brush which is amazing for either
packing on powder or blending out your
concealer girl the strobe brush it's
just per the perfect density in a fan
brush and this is the f40 too and then
this one is the F 89 and if you can see
you can blend out your foundation with
this as well or you can like bake really
well with it has those great angles or
you can blend out your concealer contour
just a great shape for the baking
strobing cream contour cream highlight
situation last but not least have a
bronzer I want to mention to you guys
that I discovered this is Tahiti from
buxom and I don't contour with this
bronzer I'm more so just kind of blended
around and warm up my face because it
has like this much shimmer in it and
it's so pretty oh I don't have the
butter bronzer by physicians formulas
really good too could possibly be a dupe
for this but they're both great I
recommend them okay so that's it for
this video holy bejesus
I talked so much and mentioned so many
products of your the best 2017 it's
going to be a great year power through
