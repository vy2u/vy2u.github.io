bag right now this isn't what's up guys
I'm gonna go ahead and start off this
video by requesting you guys grab a
snack
your dog your cat your mom your best
friend your grandma because this is
gonna be a long video baby we have so
much makeup to talk about I'm gonna be
talking about my favorite makeup of 2017
makeup I'm talking about today you've
seen me talk about before I mean this
stuff is good good stuff I just have a
lot to talk about especially because I
incorporated drugstore and high-end
makeup into one video so girl I'm gonna
be out of breath I already have my dr.
pepper on hand to help me breathe Lulu's
video so yeah I'm really excited to be
talking about this now you guys know I
did my worst of 2017 putting a damper on
us and now it's time to give some praise
some of these brands have come out with
amazing product that deserve the
recognition
I've also gonna talk about skincare so I
need to stop blabbing in this intro and
let it roll huh nah nah okay let me go
ahead and sing that subscribe song and
then we'll get started be sure Rin
subscribe to my channel oh go ahead and
jump right into it
oh my goodness where do I begin holy bug
oles I got to talk about so let me just
let me just start wait first I'm gonna
talk about skin care I think is that
okay with you guys I hope so
okay skin care perks is pixie h2o skin
drink this is a pure hydration gel I
love this product I think it's amazing
who are adding hydration to your skin
especially oily skin just because your
skin solely doesn't mean it doesn't need
any hydration
I think dry skin and all the skin both
need hydration and so this is a great
product to add hydration but not the
excess also your skin's got a little
beautiful and radiant but not over
produce old because the product isn't
that great I'm this is what it looks
like and I lost the lid to it but I've
been using it for a while and it is a
dupe for a drunk elephant which is like
a hundred dollar skin hydration Jill so
it's awesome let's talk about some like
I said high-end and drug stores gonna be
in this video so so for primers I have a
few okay first is the Bobbi Brown this
is the vitamin enriched face base and I
really fell in love with this product it
only takes a little bit so this jar will
last you throughout all the 2018 if you
want it to it just takes a smidge bit
and I find that it makes the foundation
go on like butter and just really smooth
on the skin very hydrating product if
you have oily skin I don't know that
this is the product for you but if
you're dealing with dry patches or dry
skin or just your skin your foundation
just isn't like smoothing over really
nice on your skin or it doesn't look
very natural this product just helps
that it's so good and I this the first
time I tried it I think they've had this
product for a long time the first time I
tried it out was in 2017 and it's
amazing oh by the way if you want to
hear me talk about all these products
but you don't have time to watch this
whole video if you hit the little nut
icon down there the little like nut bolt
you know what I mean and then you can go
to speed and you can adjust the speed of
the video and you can watch me talk
about these products really fast I
normally do a 1.5 or - it's getting
crazy they are in my basket of love
right here I'm digging through I'm all
about hydration because that but that is
like everything to me just
beautiful hydrated skin so another
product I really loved as hyaluronic
acid in it which were changed moisture
into your skin so it is by Smashbox they
released this product this year is the
photo finish primer primer primer my
primer Iser
this is a primer and moisturizer and one
I personally like to moisturize my skin
and then prime my skin but when I use
this product I only put this on and I'm
good to go
very moisturizing very lightweight makes
your makeup look amazing
I love this stuff by the way I'm saying
my piece on these products and then
we're just gonna move on for skincare
I had three standout products that were
amazing just stand out just like this
fingernail that's missing nail polish
first one is the Garnier Fructis this is
their moisture bomb I think this is one
of the greatest skincare products
they've come out with this is a dupe for
aqua balm that's at Sephora it's like
really expensive and this is the exact
same stuff it is amazing gel moisturizer
it has its water base instead of oil
base like cream moisturizers so you
still get the same amount of moisture
but just not on the oil and it will
leave your skin looking flawless without
clogging your pores and and making your
breakouts worse so I really count on
this I use it all the time it's in this
nice glass jar it's a really great
product and it's affordable next up is
Jesus but this is really great this is
the origin spot remover so this is an
acne treatment gel it comes in this
teeny tiny little pod and you open it
and you use just like I mean a dot of it
you squeeze it oh there goes and a
little bit comes out if you have big
festering zit and you put this product
on there let it dry go to bed it will be
reduced half the size in the morning
this really has helped me with breakouts
I even have like a patch of breakouts on
my forehead so I'll just rub it on the
area and what I like about it is that it
dries down and kind of like suctions to
the zits a lot of zit cream is like a
cream so it can wipe away so easy and
you're sleep sleeping on your pillow and
it could take it off but this really
dries down in the morning
they have to wipe the product off but it
helps it is a salicylic acid treatment
it's really amazing and if you're
dealing with like a big festering or
even under the skin zit that is so
helpful
next standout partner for me I think
I've mentioned this for two years in a
row I just can't get enough I have tried
all the glam glow masks and I pretty
much liked them all but there's
something about this Linda Jess I
literally can see my pores smaller after
I use this my breakouts are less intense
after I use this even if I'm breaking
out I'll just put some on there as well
and just let it dry and wash it off and
it really helps with breakouts this
product is great this is the super mode
by the way I guess I'll tell you the
name of it you've probably seen it
around now Glen Glo is a little bit
pricey but what you can do is you can
get the $20 jar of it as a four which is
mini but what instead of putting the
mini all over your face because that
would be like two or three uses for 20
bucks you can just use it as kind of
like a spa treatment or if you're like
breaking out right here just put a
little bit right here and it gives you a
chance to really try out the product
before you spend about 75 bucks on this
to see if it's worth it and see if it
works for you
you can even put it around poor areas
and you can literally see your pores and
it's just a way to try it out and get
like maybe 10 use this out of the mini
pot to see if it's worth your while I'm
spending the money on the big pot by
getting the sample size if you get the
sample size I just don't recommend
putting it all over your face cuz you're
only gonna get like two uses for twenty
dollars okay and that was my skincare
stuff so let's keep digging deep into
makeup so foundations I have four
foundations that you guys have seen me
talk about non-stop and probably wish I
was shut up about but I mean it when I
tell you this he's are really glean
first let's just get it out of the way
this is one of my favorites from last
year and it carried over through the
whole year this year I loved it so much
this is the vanish stick from hourglass
and I burn through these like nothing
else
I travel with nothing but these this is
the best always count on long wearing
full coverage matte foundation I've ever
used in my life okay every time I wear
people telling my skin looks pretty and
I'm like thank you it's amazing okay
this foundation is so good I used way
too much about on my skin a lot of
people don't recommend they use as much
as I use but I'm happy with the amount
that I use and it'll probably last you
longer if you don't use as much as me
but I think that this product is just
truly a godsend drugstore foundation the
infallible Pro glow from L'Oreal this is
a really beautiful foundation it is not
matte and it's medium coverage but it
adds a little bit of glow and doing this
to your skin it just gives you a little
bit of a luminous finish and it is so
pretty on your skin
I am shade 205 natural beige and then
another foundation is the Laura Mercier
follows fusion they launched this one
this year this foundation is amazing it
reminds me a little bit of hourglass
vanish but just a different texture
because it's the liquid and that's a
solid but I apply this all over my face
and it gives the most beautiful finish
it's also very long wearing so if you
have a really long day at work whatever
this foundation you can definitely count
on to look beautiful from day from the
beginning to the end of your day I
really count on that foundation all the
time and then lastly is the wet and wild
photo focus foundation this is a really
amazing foundation it reminds me a
little bit of pro glow it has like a
little bit of duty luminous luminosity
to it it's really pretty they launched
it this year and not only that this is
incredibly affordable foundation from
the drugstore it does kind of smell bad
but if you can get past that because you
can't smell it once you get it on your
face if you can just get past that you
will love this foundation and I have
been using cream beige as my shade
concealers I have two how can we do this
video without mentioning the year's
spotlight concealer the Tarte shaped
tape this is the most blendable full
coverage beautiful concealer this is
what it looked like I know you guys have
heard of it before you get a lot in the
container and it's sold it Ulta and I
love it I love everything about it I can
always count on it if I got the dark
circles for it to cover and do the job
who would I be without mentioning my
NARS radiant creamy concealer this
is one of my all-time favorite
concealers I have been using this stuff
for years here we are in 2017 I'm still
talking about it it's a really really
really good concealer Norrish as does
concealer right even the one in the pot
is really great this lasts long does
increase covers everything I need to
cover in it that one's a little more
liquidy this one's a little more of a
whipped texture I like them both setting
powder I have two oh here we go okay
two and one doesn't have a lid on but
this is the color FX perfecting setting
powder it is tap free which is amazing
and this one came out this year and
cover FX killed it they have really
great facial products but this setting
powder is great for the under eyes I
have recommended it just so many people
and they love it
also Too Faced came out with you born
this way
ethereal setting powder and I love the
whole Born This Way line I love the Born
This Way Foundation I love this powder
it the two powders are very very similar
neither of them flash back and they do a
great job baking and setting your makeup
you can count on both of these for
eyebrows I'm just gonna mention the one
and only brow pencil I pretty much use
the whole year it's the persistent
precisely my brow pencil from benefit I
like it it has small hair like strokes
I used the shade number four I was an
ambassador of this product I loved it so
much I was on the packaging of it this
year I'm I think I'm still in the
package I'm still the packaging for this
I love it and I do my brows with it
every day
it just never fills me and it's very
long wearing I hate when eyebrow
products to waxing if you rub you know
it's like your brows gone but it has
that great in-between of a little bit of
wax in it but a lot of pigmentation so
it's a really great brow pencil and I
think it lasts just I love the brow is
from on Sacha Beverly Hill don't get me
wrong that it's a tried and true brow
product as well but I just think that
that one the actual pencil lasts a
little bit longer I burned through brow
wiz is so fast geez Louise bronzers I
only had one and unfortunately you guys
have heard of it somebody
but it's the hoola bronzer from benefit
this is just a tried-and-true bronzer
it's great I use it all the time it's
the perfect shade it's a great great
bronzer I can count on it especially for
contouring cuz it has that perfect
undertone to it and it is matte with no
shimmer I love hula okay blush oddly
enough I have three boys I have three
blushes and I'm don't even wear blush
that much the first one is by pixie and
actually Aspen over created this one is
called Rome rose and it's very beautiful
it's like pink with a gold undertone I
love this it's so pretty good job Aspen
this blush is awesome it's the perfect
pink - next up is the dose of colors
peach blush which if you guys don't know
about this about me I am a sucker for a
peach blush Mac peaches I used for years
but this kind of took its place this is
called amazement blush from dose of
colors and I use it all the time is a
really beautiful color and has just a
hint of shimmer in it and lastly this
one's kind of similar to the one that
has been created with pixie but it's
really pretty it's by flower beauty this
one is called warm hibiscus and it has
like a gold reflective to it but this
one's gold reflective is a little bit
more strong almost use it as a highlight
and a half like a peachy war it's almost
like a dupe for NARS orgasm but it's
really gorgeous and I let's talk about
three highlighters I had three standout
highlighters this year which I just
think are above and beyond and the first
one is Oprah glow goals so nikich twirls
created this one this year and I think
that she accidentally it wasn't an
accident
she did it on purpose but she created
the best-loved gold gold gold highlight
I wear this all the time like I
literally wear this all the time it's
the best okay you guys need to try it
okay next up I think I have to mention
this because it works really well this
is just such a cool invention first
Ollie came out with the jelly bean
highlighter and it's just a really cool
highlighter it's super glowy really
pretty on the skin it's super innovative
and it works so I just want to show you
that oh my god it's so pretty and it's
pretty easy to use I'm actually gonna
just a little bit you know uh it's just
so easy to use especially for cream
highlight and I think it's innovative
and they killed it so I'm happy for them
and I think this is a great product so
jelly bean you win this next up is my
iconic London illuminator drops this is
another really great highlight that's
actually the one I'm wearing today you
guys will have a digit Oriole on this
look on Saturday probably so hang time
I'm really excited about these though I
think they're great I saw how much my
Instagram was using them so skeptical
but after all using them they're
absolutely amazing amazing amazing
amazing these are great and they're very
thick okey dokey oh and I have another
highlighter I use this one all year I
use the mega glow highlight from wet n
wild so this one's golden flower crown
precious petals I think was my favorite
but now this one became my favorite
because I love golden highlighters but
wet and wild makes some of the blinding
most blinding drugstore highlighters
okay I showed up Alice I have three and
first I'm gonna talk about my own
shameless self promo but I think would
be absolutely nuts for me not to talk
about my own product in this video I
created it I'm in love with it and you
guys have made this launch so huge for
us and just thank you for all the
support
thank you guys who have purchased a
pilot I have been enjoying so much I
scroll to the hashtag Laura Lee Los
Angeles and Cass pajamas all the time
and I see so many creative looks and
just so many absolutely different looks
from the same palette and I think that's
so amazing you guys are so creative and
I wear this palette all the time I
travel with it it's my go-to I created
it it's my baby it's the product that
launched Laurel in Los Angeles and I'm
so proud of it and this was just a huge
goal of 2018 and 17 and I it's
everything to me like I'll always
remember this palace that rest of my
life and yeah it's so special girl get
it together that being said I did listen
to a lot of you guys his feedback and if
this palette just wasn't the one for you
I understand that completely I listen to
you guys this feedback and Laura Lee Los
Angeles is launching a lot of new stuff
in 2018 so hang tight for that and if
you did get this palette I've gotten so
much positive feedback on the quality of
the eyeshadow I knew you guys would love
it whenever you got it and I've gotten
like I said so much positive feedback so
just hang tight we're coming up with so
much more good stuff and I'm so excited
but again thank you for the support on
this you guys are above and beyond and
amazing okay next up is from colour-pop
this is one of the prettiest palettes
I've ever seen and I just want to say
shout out the colour-pop because they've
grown so much this year and came out
with their press eyeshadows they're
freaking amazing they're affordable
they're pans are really tiny but I don't
know I their price is so low that it's
worth it and this is one of the new
magic palette it's so pretty oh my gosh
it has all the mattes and shimmers you
want
it's got bronzes Gold's greens pinks
maroon oh this color scheme this palette
is so beautiful for me it just recently
came out so well I got to use it three
or four times but this is something that
I have been adoring lately and I really
wanted to shout them out in this video I
think there are special brand and I want
to thank them as well for helping me and
being able to give back to animals which
we'll talk about that a little more
later but the magic palette and color
pop if you ain't got it girl go get it
and lastly for I shoulda palette is
below a 35
the morphe 35o - I think I like this one
best out of all the morphe 35o s there's
a morphe 35o shimmer 35o matte and then
the original 35 oh but this one I think
it's the best I really love the
arrangement of and this for my warm tone
girls out there okay but I love the
arrangement of colors and all the pretty
mats down here it's like you could
create a dozen looks now all your looks
will be warmed home with this palette
but it's a great everyday eyeshadow
palette it's beautiful I mean look at
the color arrangement hello it's like
hot fire if you're looking for like a
good and this palette is super
affordable I believe it's like 22 bucks
so if you're looking for a good
affordable actually palette lots of
color it's a big bang for your buck this
is a good palette lashes have one pair
of lashes that just have my art and I'm
wearing them right now Miami by Lily
lashes are my go-to the whole entire
year they're so sexy and fluttery and
then they're kind of thick at the base
and I just think they're the grid slash
ever they're really flirty lashes
because they like kind of spiked up and
then they're kind of thicker down at the
bottom so they give you that really be
Vavoom look but with a little bit of a
wispy touch they're amazing okay guys
mascara I have four mascaras to talk
about today - a drug source who are high
in the first one is the door pump and
volume mascara this is a very hello this
is a very sticky mascara and it makes my
last suit my last is above it my lashes
stand up and in the brush on its spiky
so it helps them to separate I love the
stuff next this is a really great
thickening mascara this is the velvet
new worn by Marc Jacobs I have been
living by this for years and years maybe
like two years but it is so good and it
does a great job coating the bottom
lashes the lash paradise mascaras pretty
much a dupe for the better than sex
mascara by Too Faced it's really amazing
really great volumizing thickening the
lashes as well and then lastly is the
lash sensational this was just in
special packaging because it's like Gigi
Hadid collaboration but this is an
amazing uplifting lash mascara so it
does a great job getting your lash
stand up straight I travel with us all
the time so that is my mascaras I have a
lot of mascaras I fell in love with this
year for eyeliner I have one eyeliner
which just blew me away and I have it on
today and I use it every time I put on
eyeliner I just go to it this is the
pretty vulgar eyeliner it comes in this
weird little ink pot but you get a
crapload of eyeliner on here like this
is a huge container I don't know you
guys can't see down in there but there's
a lot of liner down in there and this is
like the best matte black long wearing
liner and it never transfer so I have
problem with liners so I look up they
get in my crease this one doesn't do
that once it dries down it just stays in
its place and it's really good so that's
one of my favorite eyeliners of the year
and I just fell in love with it I have
to mention this this is the Stila their
sister eyeshadow liquid eyeshadows oh my
god this is like the best invention ever
these are the best way to wear glitter
they're so easy and I love all the
colors of them I don't really have a
favorite I guess kitten would be my
favorite guys these just might be like
the best thing ever you just put them on
you can even use your fingers spread
them out and they just it sticks it
trace down it doesn't crease it doesn't
crack it isn't flake it is a really
great product to count on and it does
such every time I wear them someone's
like what like it's that still a girl
it's seriously the best okay and I just
want to mention this lash glue because I
get asked often what's a good lash glue
and this one is black so if you don't
like a black lash lash glue you might
not like this one but I really really
love this one this is the huda beauty
lash glue the thing I love most about it
it makes it easy to put on false lashes
with this because it dries almost
instantly so once you put it on your
lash this one's seen better days but
once you put it on your false lash you
can just almost immediately put the
false lash on your eye it dries your
lashes stuck on because I find that it's
kind of hard for people to put on false
lashes whenever the glue is really wet
and you put it on and it's popping up
and then you put it on as sloughing
around because that glue is it tacky
enough but this one's almost instantly
tacky so you don't have to wait on it
and just sticks on your eye
you're good to go so this is a really
good one and I think it just makes
people really makes it really easy for
beginners
okay lip products I have a hundred of
them to talk about so let's begin first
is the shuwei essentials lip enhancer
girl this is I don't like to just chop
stick so this is my bread and butter and
Holy Grail product like oh this will
make your lips so soft and I put it on
every single night before I go to bed I
keep it in my purse and it does wonders
for my lips if you're dealing with pilly
lips or cracky lips that will transform
your lips also drink more water that
helps to the next lip product I'm gonna
talk about is one of my favorites from
my collection that I did with colour-pop
and again a hundred percent of the
proceeds goes to Nokia la Best Friends
Animal Shelter to help save animals
lives and this is BAM so this is the
ultra satin maroon shade and it's the
best way to wear maroon lippy because
it's this is not kiss proof but it's so
comfortable and it's time but if you go
mmm
it looks at matte on your lips so it
looks like you have this bold beautiful
matte liquid lipstick on but really it's
satin and it's like very movable you can
move your lips very comfortable it is
transfer it does transfer but you don't
have to worry about like sloughing or
running because it does kind of stay in
place so it's just the best of both
worlds and it's very even in color like
I girl I just did the craziest watch
ever but oh this color is so pretty so
we sold out of the lip sets we're gonna
try to get some more of those on
colour-pop and you can buy that color
individually for 6 bucks
next up Kylie Jenner I keep this in my
purse and I wear it like almost every
day
this is Hera velvet liquid lipstick
which is the best formula and verb okay
for liquid lipsticks or a wee bit drying
for me but the velvet ones are mmm so
this one is actually called birthday
suit and it's so pretty it's a great
nude you guys know Miss Greece I'm a
sucker for a good nude but this one has
a peachy brown undertone to it so it
looks really beautiful on
of all the things I talk about today
there's no mirror oh it's so pretty Ava
I mix it with other colors all the time
and it's just so comfortable to wear
another favorite lip product that came
out this year Smashbox I love that
liquid lipsticks they're formula is
amazing for all of them with this color
develop the vino new you're from their
metallic line oh it's like a deeper
maroon shade but it has shimmer to it
which kind of looks dark and plum at
times it's really beautiful and very
comfortable on the lips so you go
Smashbox okay and the last product I
have to talk about with you guys is the
wise it's fresh from morphe this is like
my brush of the year this is like my
baby right here
I've lend out my foundation with it
every single day and pretty much my
concealer with it every single day this
is an amazing foundation brush is $9.99
it's a flat top kabuki it is extremely
soft and it blends out the foundation
making it look flawless and it's also
effortless way to blend out stick
foundation cream foundation liquid
foundation it does the job right and
again I'll even like get closer to it
squeeze it make it a little more dense
and get right there and blend out my
concealer it's phenomenal it's a great
must-have brush in your collection so I
know I had to mention that you guys
could see the massive pile makeup on my
desk ain't mad about it oh and I got to
talk about one more thing the tatcha
luminous dewy skin this girl this is so
nice if you have oily skin you might not
like this that much if your makeup is
like matte and powdery and you want it
to look a little more skin like and a
little more dewy it just couple spritz
of this and it will literally just do
the job
it's a miracle product it's interesting
how this product just automatically
makes your skin look dewy and beautiful
I don't know what's in it exactly but
