video is going to be talking about
really a four-hole makeup or fab doll
hair I'll stop
$5 and it's like 5 bucks and under this
makeup is aqua blossom and yeah I'm
going to tell you what the good good is
so I hope you're excited for this video
I was going to do my natural background
today with the vanity of but it just
weren't working out girl the sunlight
was coming through was blinding blowing
out everything something we're going to
do it background just let you know most
the time I do the backdrops whenever I'm
filming during the day and whenever I
went night I do my natural background
that's how I decide because the sunlight
just blows out the background oh I
forgot to tell you guys also these are
my natural like I'm not wearing any
false lashes I decided to get like my
lash permed up so now they stand up
straight is to go down so I'm going to
be trying to like wear my natural lashes
a little bit more I'm really excited
about it the bee excite with me about it
so we're going to go ahead and jump
right in I'll probably be in another
country by the time this video goes live
that is so random let's go ahead and get
started first I don't run I run into
this month take a bunch of the powder
and it can be yours for 20 payments of
$5 I'm just kidding first product to
talk about now that we're like six
minutes deep into the video we haven't
even started is these more feet press
Pegman now they are 5 9 now but you know
I got a discount code that brings it on
down closer to 5 doll hairs
but seriously I love these so much and I
am actually wearing my favorite one in
high class on my lid today if you're
wondering what that color is it is a
more p price pigment these are so
amazing and they still kind of sort of
similar to the Mac press pigments which
are like $21 apiece and they're really
big so they'll last you for a really
long time some of my favorite shades
include high-class get designer
everything which is just stunning and
then we have powder room which is this
friend right here oh girl literally so
freaking pretty and these are well worth
5 dollars our convincing you have a few
of them a press pigment just have so
it's just a lot more creamy than a
regular
shimmery eyeshadow would you want to
hand me that blue case of makeup wipes
because I got makeup all over my hands
and video can't go on thank you can't
move right along I'm going to be talking
about a couple items from makeup
revolution and I really love this brand
the first product that I absolutely
adore and highly recommend to you this
is a baked bronzer powder and this one
is in shade ready to go I actually have
this on today and what I like to do with
this and I know it's a lot of makeup but
after I contour because this has a lot
of shimmer in it I just like to run this
over my contour to really give me that
glowy look rather than that hard matte
structured look that just gives it a
little bit of a warrant a little bit of
the glow a little bit of natural glow
from within did you see my extension
tracks right there you probably did okay
such a pretty product they have them in
different shades these are literally
five dollars I feel I I wouldn't contour
with them just because they're so
shimmery can see that that's like Alissa
highlights if shimmery but it's really
pretty on top of a broader it just adds
a little bit of glow to any matte
bronzer that you might want to like jazz
up your look a little you know next I'm
going to recommend to you guys from
makeup revolution is their blushes they
actually have a bunch of them that I
like fusion is one of my favorite ones
and I do have it on my apples in my
cheeks
today these are so creamy they don't
feel like a dried powder blushes have
like a very creamy S to them here is a
good little swatch see how pretty that
is
if you recommend going in with a light
hand with these because they are super
super super pigmented and you will get a
lot of products off on your brush but
they blend out really nice I think it's
because they have like that creamy
formula to them and they're only a
whoppin fabulous another bronzer that I
really like this is $4.99 this is I
literally just spit like I projectile
spit across the screen the bronzer is
$4.99 it's like essence beauty this
one's in shade one natural and it's very
pretty it almost goes just what is it
justice unless nose just like to make a
revolution blushes it has so much of a
creamy background and texture formula to
it so it blends out really nice on the
skin I think they only have two shades
and it was kind of lame this one works
out pretty well for me in the summertime
it might not be dark enough but I love
the essence powder some other products
are hit admit this but this is
definitely hit 49 and a few
you can't beat it with a stick watch
next I have to mention these because
dear Lord in heaven they are fabulous
and I've gotten so many questions on
them now I recently did a video if you
haven't seen it I want to know why is it
reviewing wet-and-wild makeup and I
reviewed their liquid lipsticks in this
video and they are everything and above
I love these so much they last so long
they do take a long time to dry down on
your lips whenever I first tried them
out for a while I was a very sticky
feeling so I wasn't stealing it exactly
but then they eventually dried down all
the way and they didn't get those little
crack ease in them so I feel like
because they're a bit moisturizing
that's what makes them take a long time
to dry down there are quite a fabulous
product and I mean we're realist
so a couple of my favorite shades are
pink really hard nudie with duty and
this one is nudist peach I will say new
this page is just so freakin pretty it's
unreal but it was really streaky so I
had to put like three coats of it on to
get a really nice even layer but there
are only five dollars and it's just well
worth it and if you see these out of
your local drugstore honey you better
grab a little fast as I know they're
going to go really fast next up how
could I do this video without mentioned
the concealer and I know I've mentioned
this concealer I think in my last videos
I had talked about $5 makeup but I'm
going to do it again because I'm a
repeater it's the pro crystal from la
girl la girl has so many amazing
products on their web this is one of my
favorite products that they've ever come
out with these are five dollars apiece
and it's actually a really nice
blendable non creasing non greasy
concealer with a good best coverage to
it I like to contour and highlight with
these my shade is natural in my
concealer shade medium bisque is one
that I like to contour with but I know
for a fact I like to mix it with one of
these is even darker
I might mix the two together to contour
with I can't find my darker one so I'm
just kind of mentioned the hue miss one
literally these are so bleed next is
another product I've mentioned so many
times on my channel but I truly love it
so I'm going to mention it again and
it's so affordable I think this is like
three dollars if I'm not mistaken how
long has that been on my face
I literally have lipstick all over I
paid and that's what I get for not
looking
into my viewfinder in this video or else
I would have null ma you know better
okay we ready go t dang it so this is
the elf primer I think it has the
consistency of an high end primer it
doesn't feel silicone base and it has
like a lot of moisture to it so V of dry
skin this is fabulous and I love
whenever I blend it out it almost gives
me a little bit of tacky feel like my
foundation is going to adhere to it so
it just feels great does it leave my
skin greasy and adds a bit of moisture
to the skin the packaging is very plain
ice is certainly not least at to gel
eyeliners that are right here okay the
first one is wet and wild actually kind
of hate the eyeliner brushes that comes
with this or the end or brush that comes
with this smell good this is a great
liner it is 4.99 and yeah it's really
nice it's a good black matte liner that
lasts and it's not crusty crust so I
highly recommend it to you and then one
of my all-time favorites affordable
eyeliner just the essence gel liner and
you can buy separately a brush with a
green handle from s's to work fabulous
with this liner that's also very
affordable this one has a very gel like
bill to it it almost reminds me a little
bit of the Inglot black gel liner which
is the best ever and it is such a good
product very long-lasting and doesn't
transfer to above my eyelids because it
dries so hardcore matte black I love it
I want to go over what this is well that
is it for this video I cannot believe I
had lipstick all over my top and bottom
teeth for majority of the video anyways
