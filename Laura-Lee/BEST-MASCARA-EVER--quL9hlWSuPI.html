about to talk about for like two or
three minutes and it was sitting right
in front of me I was like looking around
it probably picked it up and moved it
oops Oh Dave you is going to be be
showing you the greatest mascara ever I
have like an ongoing battle with
mascaras I don't know about you guys but
it's either a love or absolutely hate I
have trouble with my real lashes because
they like to go straight and it's super
annoying so I have had a mascara that is
just doing the works for me I put my
hair up in a ponytail so I wouldn't
touch it and all I'm doing is touching
my hair I'm a hair texture I'm super
excited sharing the mascara with you and
we're gonna jump right in this video and
get started I hope you guys enjoy the
video if you do give her a thumbs up the
mascara I have been loving is Marc
Jacobs velvet noir major Volume Mascara
I would have never remembered that whole
name so I had to read out the box I have
to admit like the packaging is one of
the things that I love most about it
because it's just gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous packaging but let me tell you
why I love the mascara and at the end of
the video I'm gonna demo it out so you
can see like the difference it makes in
my lashes oh and before I keep going let
me just tell you it hasn't launched yet
I'm sorry about that I will let you guys
know it's launching very soon on some
force website Marc Jacobs calm and all
that and I will let you guys know asap
whenever it launches but it's launching
super soon and the way I got it is
influenced or sent it to me yeah and I'm
really glad they did but influencer I
don't know if you guys know what that is
it's like a site where you don't have to
be a beauty blogger or anything you just
take quizzes and connect your social
media up to it and like they will sing
you loads of free stuff so I get the
constant question on YouTube how do I
get free stuff if you're not a beauty
blogger the only way I really know how
to is Influenster um they're really
awesome it wouldn't have an app it's
like a website or an app the influencer
app I'll link it down below I don't get
like paid a certain amount if you sign
up for it it's not an affiliate thing
more active you are on the side the more
chances you get and getting like
package that's how that works a really
cool website that I've been a part of
right whenever I started on YouTube
another youtuber told me about it and I
signed up and I've gotten like five or
six free boxes packed full of different
samples and says they actually sent me
this stab at YouTube channel I'll link
the at the websites YouTube channel all
that down below you want to know more
about Influenster there i've have all
the different reasons i love this
mascara the first one is the color of it
and i know that sounds crazy but some
mascaras just aren't black enough for me
and this mascara is like super super
super duper black and i love that about
it it just makes the lashes look more
bold the darker black it can get because
there are some blacks where it's like I
don't know it's not aggressive enough
for me I love how dark this mascara is
oh so yeah just went down a little
rabbit trail back to the mascara another
thing that I like about it is the way it
is the lashes oh my goodness you guys
know I'm addicted to my false lashes I
just can't put them down but I've been
trying to incorporate more looks and do
better about not wearing them every day
and I love this mascara for that
reasoning it makes the lashes super full
and thick it just gives them so much
volume as does false lashes so it's like
kind of taking the place of a false lash
I don't notice any fallout from the
mascara I don't notice it like taking a
long time to dry which get someone arms
a little bit whenever I mascara it's
like super wet I don't notice that about
it whenever it does launch its supposed
to cost $26 for and per Marc Jacobs I
don't really think that that is that too
terrible of a price because is in like
the Too Faced better than sex like $25
so let's talk about the one it's like an
hourglass shape it's like OOP and it
says that it's supposed to be that shape
to help you get like way up in there
where it's really hard to reach I like
the base of your lashes so I really like
that about it and I agree it does do
that you know it's really close up into
like the base of the lashes to really
pick the lashes up and make them Viva
boom beautiful as for me I just like
that drama
I like those like oversized big gorgeous
fluttery lashes I feel like that's
pretty much what this
to my real lashes without false lashes
so I don't know I just love it so much I
absolutely have to share it with you
guys now that I've talked about how
fabulous the mascara is a bet let's jump
over and do the demo so I can put what
I'm saying into action I'm going to show
you me using it is I'll take it at the
base and I'll twirl it and go up oh I'm
so obsessed guys
holy Toledo okay just to note this was
done with one pump I didn't continuously
pump into the mascara say I do notice
that the wand does cause me to touch my
eyelid just a little bit and that may be
the way that I twirl and put on my
mascara but it's just got the wands
really bristly so I do touch like the
top of my eyelid a little bit but I do
love the way it makes my lashes stand up
and it makes them like really thick and
it coats them so easy without me having
to add 25,000 layers it's just like one
brush full is one and done and I love
the outcome of my lashes or Zee look at
my other eye it's crazy
okay something unique to me also about
it is that as thick as each lash is they
don't stick together which is so
annoying whenever you have like three
big lashes by the end of it is like no
they're like individually nice fat juicy
lashes so that is it for this review I
hope you guys enjoyed it this is my
all-time favorite mascara right now and
I thought I needed a shout out know that
I'm looking at crazy because I only have
one eye done anyways I hope you did
enjoy this video if you did please give
it a thumbs up it helps me out a lot I
love you guys thank you so much for
watching and I hope to see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
