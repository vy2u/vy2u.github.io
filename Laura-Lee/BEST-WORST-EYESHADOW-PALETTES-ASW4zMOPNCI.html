channel today's video is going to be an
updated best and worst eyes shadow
palettes video I filmed this video like
a month ago and okay why I filmed it
like almost a year ago I feel like a
month ago my brain it says all kinds of
crazy things it doesn't mean I'm just
like a year ago and obviously a lot of
palettes have faced out while the new
palettes have come in and I want to talk
about some of the new palettes I am
dying for that have literally just come
out and some pallets have come out
they're just a floppity floo floo so
without further ado we're gonna sing a
little song
I will go ahead and get right into the
video
alright T time T time T time what is
good okay so first I'll start off with
I'm gonna go back and forth i'ma go do a
good palette and bad palette good
palette actually have a lot of bad
pellets that I just don't like and I'll
tell you why
anyways first let's talk with the club
Morello this is her second collaboration
with ciate her second part too pretty
fearless fun palette pretty fun and
fearless hello I went ahead and swatch a
couple colors for you I find that the
shimmers are super creamy and then the
mats are super pigmented and I played a
little bit with this palette and I
really enjoyed it and to be honest I
like this palette even more than the
first one I think she killed it with
this she does such a good job with
eyeshadows and on the color arrangement
is really really really pretty of greens
and reds and purples but then you also
have like some nice transition shades to
be able to create a complete look with
this palette and I love when pellets
have enough shades that you can complete
a 100 cent complete look with it I think
she did such a good job I think just the
quality of cia's shadows are super super
nice so you get even more this one's
bigger than her first collaboration and
I like it even more I think she killed
it and I've really been enjoying this
palette so congrats Chloe you did a
great job or else I wouldn't be talking
about it right now girlfriend you know
that killed a palette that did not work
out for me was the de Tasha - Nona this
is such a popular palette this is the
star palette and not every color didn't
work for me but quite a few colors were
a bust I think this guy is super super
super pretty palette but if you could
see I bet you can just look at this and
tell me which color was the issue yeah
this guy right here
I decided um one of the first times I
wore this color all the mats by the way
are great in this palette but mine Jesus
like a hundred and some odd dollars I
extremely expensive palette and so I
expected every color to be bomb-diggity
especially for the price point and so I
wanted to do a really pretty kind of
sparkly beautiful eye for Drakon I was
meeting so many of you guys and by the
way I already have my swatches ready for
my next palette that I love anyway so I
you know used all my matte
and then I actually put down a glitter
glue because I swatch this color and I
was like it's super flaky but really
pretty so let me put down a really tacky
glitter glue and pack this color on and
honey this was the worst mistake of my
life
it literally sabotage my whole makeup
look for the rest of the day
it literally crumbled and flaked all
down my face my thoughts lashes had it
was covered in flakes it looked like I
didn't know how to do makeup I was like
what did it literally sabotage me so I
literally in this color same thing
literally a nightmare so this palette
like I won't buy another touched on
palette with these colors in it because
I know I'll never use I mean it's just
too much money for a palette with colors
in it that I won't use you know if I if
I buy a really affordable palette and
there's a shade or two in it I don't
like I typically will buy that palette
anyways but whenever the price point
gets this high I really want to love
every shadow in it I will say these
shimmers are really good and they don't
do that but this it literally scarred me
like I'm telling you when I had glitter
all over my face
face for my eyes after I put on my
glitter glue girl so this was a bust
and with those flakiness I don't think
it's worth the money and that's just my
opinion just gonna put it out there next
pot I'm gonna show you guys is the pot
McGrath umm this is the mothership
number 3 palette she came out with three
new palettes this one is under $25 super
expensive just disclaimer straight up
front
I bought this office of four as a
website and it comes with ten shades in
it the pans are pretty big the palette
is um it's really pretty and really nice
and I will say the quality of the
eyeshadows are great I will tell you
like this shade and this shade in this
shade it's kind of like a moon dust I
shadow but I feel like they're way
creamier than mundos I should notice and
they're not nearly as flaky as all the
moon dust eyeshadows coming out like
it's like almost like a better version
of moon dust i shadow z' so i really
really really really love this eyeshadow
palette i did this look with this
palette super creamy mattes in it i just
closed my hair up in it you guys see the
quality of the eyeshadow wears like this
one's a little more arid essent but not
flaky and then the mats are so pigmented
that's
and these are like creamy shimmers it's
a really great palette I can't say it's
worth the money because once palettes
are over $100 like I'm not gonna be like
oh yeah that's so worth they go get it
for 10 eyeshadows you know the actual
quality of the eyeshadows is like
phenomenal so just to give you the T on
that and next up for a palette that
didn't work out for me the Bobby Brown a
nude drama palette I will admit I used
this only a couple times and mostly I
didn't like the shimmers in this palette
they felt super dry and flaky and they
also didn't feel like they had that much
pigment to them they were just had like
quite a bit of gaps in them so it just
wasn't like I don't know like they feel
so dusty and dry all the new they're
just not creamy whatsoever and so
whenever I packed them onto my eyelid I
just I didn't get that pigmentation that
I wanted I like a lot of heavy payment
from a shimmer I like it to be like
really bling-bling and pretty I also
like them to feel really creamy
um the mattes were pretty nice in this
palette but the shimmers were quite a
bust so I don't recommend this to you
guys next up a palette that I love and I
think so many of us love is the Jaclyn
hill ex morphe palette I gotta give her
a shout out on this this is just such a
great arrangement of colors that you
could travel with this - filthy she's
got the new packaging which doesn't get
dirty so that it's so awesome I'm
excited it's gonna be an Ulta as well
and so you get 35 eyeshadow shades and
they're all so creamy and the mattes
blend out so well I've used this palette
so many times and I just think it's an
absolutely amazing palette I won't beat
a dead horse because I know I've talked
about it several times on my channel and
told you guys how much I adore it and
think that she did such a great job with
the palette speaking of beating the dead
horse I won't go too in depth with this
but you know I got a you know I gotta
call it out you know you know I gotta
say something this is a subculture
palette and I just think this palette
was a total flop whenever I tried it out
on my channel I really hated the makeup
look I created with it I hated using it
and the shimmers are nice in the palette
it's the mats that are the issue and
there are a lot of mattes in the palette
I don't understand the formula of this
and I just think that you know if they
are supposed to be press loose pigments
there should be like a huge disclaimer
on the front of the palette because they
come out with so many palettes that are
like this shape and you open it there
just like this and then you expect it to
be like there are other eyeshadows which
I think the other eye shadows are great
and the prism palette it's pretty darn
good but this one just it didn't work
for me guys I know I didn't work for a
lot of people I know you've already
heard the tea on it so again I'm not
gonna beat a dead horse but I am gonna
let you know what I think about it next
up for our palette I do like I will talk
about this guy this has the new morphe
logo on it this is the 3502 palette now
this palette I haven't done a tutorial
for you guys yet with it I'm gonna
swatch a couple colors but I mean so
many of you guys have asked me to do a
tutorial with it and I have totally not
done that yet but I definitely will mind
you this is the 3502 they have the 35 oh
the 3500 shimmers in the 3500 Madsen's
this is the second version the 3500 -
which is a mixture of shimmer and matte
this is the warmest out of all of them I
will say it has more red color so if
you're into more reds and orange I would
say this is the one for you if you're
not I would go with the original one
honestly unless you have like a ton of
matte shadows I wouldn't get the shimmer
one cuz it has no mattes in it that's
literally 35 shimmers or if you have a
ton of shimmer so you need some more
mattes the 3500 matte might be great but
again this is a mixture so it's a better
bang for your buck and I feel like this
is the warmest one out of all of them so
again if you're really into fiery red
colors this is gonna be your great gal
the quality is so good it's about it's
very similar to the original one so if
not better so I think they killed it
with this palette and I know I'm gonna
beat you so let's talk about a palette
that didn't I don't care for this is the
power-hungry palette from Matt I feel
like all the colors were so bland and
similar to one another it wasn't worth
the money and like I felt like a lot of
the colors like you expect like really
beautiful pigment and I was swatch it
and barely anything was there so I
really didn't like it on my eyelids
especially this gold color I just wanted
it to be like out of this world and then
I hit it with my finger and I was just
like
no it's just super super super she's not
that pigmented guys I just wanted this
to have so much pigment and be pretty
but I just feel like so many other
colors basically look the exact same in
the palette this was just a flop for me
this didn't work okay and lastly I have
this palette that I love and then I have
one more palette that I didn't love and
girl what kind of fool would I be if I
did not mention my own baby and child
that I birthed okay
the larlie Los Angeles palette cat's
pajamas obviously I wear it almost every
single day
this is what I love seeing people's
palates look like because it means it's
used and loved and you got your money's
worth out of it this is just my go to it
is so beaten and abused and I use it
every day I keep this palette on my desk
and you know what's cool about it is if
I'm not using it I always pull color out
of it because it has all my go-to
eyeshadow colors in it and it's just
such a beautiful palette with great
quality and I put my heart and soul into
it it is sold out we on the morphe
website on October 27th and in the
morphe store October 27th as well
they're boring store here in California
I'll put that information down in the
description box so you'll have a second
chance to get it there I'm as far as my
website I don't know when it's gonna be
back in stock hopefully before Christmas
or trying you guys for all the support
and making this a huge success I love
you guys to death I had to talk about
her I love her what for my eyeshadow
palettes here I do that one more palette
talked about that didn't work out for me
and this is the palette Sonia Sonia
wrinkle wrinkle I don't know if I'm
saying her name right by Lancome and
this palette is super ma B I do like the
colors in it it's cool tone palette but
I found these to be very dry and flaky
everywhere and then like the like all
these are shimmers and then there's one
matte in the palette which didn't really
make that much sense to me and then you
have a matte with these two colors under
this little piece and the palette I
don't know I was just I don't understand
what this is for and why these colors
are hidden and I feel like I couldn't
get a complete look out of the eyeshadow
palette and they're super flaky so
overall this was a bit of a bus for me I
really didn't like this palette
I do like the packaging I think the
packaging is super super cute but it's
cute and little and compact but the
quality of the eyeshadows just was not
up to what I love to my stands up to my
standards darlin so that is it for this
