just start by saying this video is going
to be a long video so I think it's
important that I think the intro pretty
gosh-darn short we're gonna go over
liquid lipsticks today I have I'm going
to tell you once that I love and then
I'm gonna tell you the ones that I just
don't think are worth your money I'm not
going to go over every single liquid
lipstick I have I will give you an
overview but I will tell you my
favorites and then I will also tell you
the ones that just didn't work for me so
you can get the gist of what's good and
what's not so if you want to see my full
liquid lipstick collection I will show
you that at the end of this video and
I'll kind of give you a quick overview
and what I got in my stash
she sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave lots of great things
happening on this channel you don't want
to miss out uh-uh
and we're gonna jump right Anna get
started I feel like we should start with
kind of my favorite nudes and then I'll
tell you my favorite brands in the nudes
and my favorite colors and then the ones
that are psych and I know this may stop
when I'm not doing lip swatches guys
we're gonna go over something liquid
lipsticks this videos gonna be 20 years
long already
I do lip swatches my lips will literally
fall off of my face first one is dose of
colors bear this is one of my favorite
nude I love this color it's out of stock
a lot I do believe and if colors makes
great liquid lipsticks I think they're
$18 a piece and they do not crap this
one is a really nice cool nude
another nude that I love so much is
creme brulee buys you a cosmetics these
are just some of the creamiest liquid
lipsticks on the market this one does
have a peach undertone to it so if you
don't like peach this one might not be
for you but if you like a little bit of
color to your nude you'll definitely
like this one they gave me a discount
code which I'll put somewhere on the
screen so you can get money off one
things I love most about these they
don't crack but besides that they smell
like macaroons so good on associate
Beverly Hills make some of the best make
liquid lipsticks on the market I've
heard them eat right throughout he over
here over there everywhere and it's for
a good reason because guys they're so
good this one is called naked I believe
this is one of her new spring colors and
it does have like this slightest pink
peachy undertone to it creme brulee by
GA has a little bit more color than this
one this one's a
little bit more news the lip lingeries
by nyx are so good this one is in satin
ribbon I feel like they adhere to your
lips almost a little bit too much they
dry down with their kiss proof but they
always feel a little bit gummy so that's
one little turn-off I have with these
but the pigment is great they don't
crack and I think that's because they
stay a little a little bit like gooey or
gummy just a touch I think that's why
they never actually crack on your lips
this right here is one of my favorite
favorite colors in it it's a very nice
cool tone on that color and they're
affordable okay a brownish nude which I
just fall in love with is Chi bicolor
pop I'm gonna be dead honest with you
when I tell you the color pop formula
will crack on you all day long I love
that they're six dollars a piece and
they come very affordable and their
color range is insane like you could get
any color Under the Sun you kind of get
what you pay for with these because
they're very drying and they do indeed
crack I've won this one out a few times
see it's like a brownish nude and it's
very very very pretty after a couple
hours and wearing it I looked a little
bit crazy because it's all cracking my
lips so I don't tend to wear my
colour-pop liquid lipsticks anymore the
LA girl liquid lipsticks are a bomb
diggity price you get a lot for five
dollars they don't crack as much as the
color pop ones but they are very drying
on the lips they're nice very nice color
they apply evenly colors floor we're
kind of getting into pinky nudes if you
haven't noticed um but it's a very very
very pretty colors gonna oranjee
undertone to it I really love this one
but if you have lips that don't the skin
on them doesn't pill your lips typically
aren't dry I think you'll be okay with
the LA girl ones for me my lips are very
dry dry ass oh they're just so dry it
makes me crazy so something like this I
can only wear for a few hours and I'm
going to be peeling and cracking and
it's gonna be getting crazy
next up lip line liquid lipsticks this
one isn't resi the color is just
everything there mmm there's such good
color so this one is like a pinky nude
color it's close to naked once it dries
down by Anastacio but it does
just smidge more pink in it these are
very very drawing um so again it's just
something I don't opt for wearing very
often all right we're gonna talk about
still is Carmelo oh it's so freakin
pretty this is probably one of my
all-time favorites because I personally
like a cool new tone um that's what I
opted for the most it's so freaking
pretty and these do not crash on your
lips whatsoever and they dry down nice
and that I love the still liquid
lipsticks they don't have a lot of shade
options that's their only downfall the
actual quality of the liquid lipstick is
phenomenal we're going to talk about
this Milani liquid lipstick this is
there are more metallics and this one is
chromatic at it I love this one it is
such a pretty shimmery liquid lipstick
it does dry down so nice on the lips it
does not crack it's so wonderful for a
drugstore price however this is the only
shade out of all over I bought a couple
of them
they smell like macaroons it's the only
shade I like because the other shimmery
shades are like purple and hot pink and
I don't typically like a bright color
with shimmer if it's gonna have shimmer
it needs to be in neutral for me not
trying to make that your personal
feelings that's just my personal
feelings now we'll move on to a few more
of a ma B pinkish colors the first one
is Posie K by Kylie Jenner I've gotten
more questions about these little
suckers than ever I like her liquid
lipsticks I feel like they are quite a
bit drying but I feel like if you line
your lips completely with the lip liner
that comes with them and put this on top
it'll last all day and you'll be good to
go if you wear it without anything under
it I think it gets a little bit cracky
and quite drying so they're great and in
duo but by themself I wouldn't wear it a
complete and total dupe for it is to
tell the Rose buys you a cosmetics very
nourishing to your lips
so it's up to you but I opted for Patel
de Rose just because I don't have to
deal with the dryness Kat Von D's liquid
lipsticks are great they are never in
stock at any Sephora ever
however I was able to get these so I
guess they weren't stuck at sometimes I
got doubles there and it ended up being
a little bit too pinky for me so I'm not
obsessed with this color which is why I
pretty much never wear it but the
quality of the liquid lipsticks are
great nourishing not cracky nothing
crazy going on Lolita is one of the best
ones that she made and I really like
Lolita tube it's very spicy and orangie
undertone to it but to cap on days we
just having a mess over here we have on
these are really great liquid lipsticks
the first liquid lipstick I ever got to
try from Oprah cosmetics was Laguna
Beach and I fell in love instantly with
it it's a very whipped cream ii formula
and i love it a lot
please take a really long time to dry on
your lips vs can i put it on wait a
minute or two and so you're ready to go
i'm at least almost like an hour but
they do fully dry on your lips
eventually and they do not crack they do
i think because they're so moisturizing
that they take a long time to dry our
lips the newer ones that manny came out
with and the other ones i've worked with
in the past they dry a little bit faster
and they are still quite nourishing so I
like the ofra liquid lipstick Laguna
Beach is one of the best shades another
one of my favorite Bobby pink liquid
lipsticks is truffle by dosa colors
however I was very upset
with the quality of the packaging
because I did pay $18 for this I have
this part glued back down the whole
silver just popped off and broke and I
was like are you kidding me
now that sucked with the actual quality
is just as great as all the dosed colors
I talked about before
this is truffle I also like stolen by
them but this is just such a beautiful
everyday Mabi pink color the whole thing
just busted off so mine's like cracked
and dried out
I should've contacted them and requested
a new one I didn't because I mean nobody
got time for all that
um liquid suede liquid lipsticks are
awesome when my favorite is soft-spoken
these do dry down completely matte um
they are a little bit like the lip
lingeries I feel like these are a little
bit more drying than lip lingeries but
like I said the lip balm dries have a
little bit of a gummy feel to them
constantly
whereas these dry down completely okay
as far as new to ma be pinks have a lot
more could go over but those who just
like my ride or dies I love and highly
recommend to you now we'll move on to
brown one of my favorite Browns is
excessive by violent boss
it is so freakin rich in color this is
just like a swatch and you get an
incredible amount of pigment these are
mediocre as far as drying they're not
going to crack like crazy on your lips
but they can be a little bit drying
throughout the day so I don't think like
there are a hundred percent non drawing
an excessive is such a rich chocolate
dark brown I love it so if you're not
comfortable with a deep dark brown
I think sandstorm by next or liquid
suede it's just the absolute perfect
color I've won the hell out of this it's
like a brown but it's like a ma be more
of a cool brown not so deep in like bold
like I mentioned before the next suede
czar Bob here we have true Brown by
Kylie Jenner and it's just the same
story as Posie K it's great with a lip
liner underneath it to nourish your lips
but without it like it's too drawing
alright let's move into berry maroon
colors all-time favourite berry color
and every time I wear it someone says
what is our lives this is very me my
dose of colors I've had look at that
crusty wand it needs help
I've had this color for a few years
right when liquid lipsticks were really
hitting our market and I love it does
bury me also bury me too but I like
baring me the bed
I'm another one that's like I didn't I
like the color it's so great in rich in
color I have trouble getting it to apply
evenly it gets a little bit patchy for
me and this one's the Montenegro
Montenegro
by lip land and it is a little bit
drying so I find myself never reaching
for this Ruby slipper was one that I
love him draw our cosmetics and I like
Gerard liquid lipsticks I think they're
very nice on the lips um the only
problem is the darker the colors I find
that they don't apply to evenly they're
very patchy and I mentioned this because
the darker the color the more you can
really tell about the pigment and if it
applies in Li I found that I had to
apply quite a few coats of this to get
like an even color
cross my lips and the Gerard was kind of
hard to work with but the color is so
freakin beautiful and I don't find the
dried ones to be drying on me at all
another berry color I could just live
and breathe and eat is Madison my honest
Asha it is so incredibly bold and it's
incredibly crazy how even this color
applies I personally think i'm stas just
got some of the best liquid lipsticks on
the market so we're going to move on to
res at Kylie Jenner's marriage okay
because this is a deeper color I do find
that it applies pretty darn evenly ones
are really really really bright red in
my personal opinion I like a little bit
of deepness to my red liquid lipsticks
and this one's a bit bright for me not
saying I won't ever wear it just depends
on my mood a red that I really really
like is lady balls by Too Faced these
are extremely moisturizing liquid
lipsticks they remind me a little bit of
the August house show Beverly Hills
liquid lipsticks and you can't go wrong
with them they're moisturizing they feel
nice on the lips they don't crack and
it's very matte very kiss proof very
liquid lipstick like and I love Lady
Vols for red I don't know how to
pronounce this one exactly from Shu and
I know if I say it wrong my comments
will be nothing but people correcting me
grammar police I will put the text on
the screen and I love love love the
shade is probably one of my favorite red
liquid lipsticks I gotta say between
this and the Too Faced they're probably
my all-time favorite red liquid
lipsticks
on the market and you can even see right
now on my hand that this Kylie Jenner
one is turning so crusty and dry it just
it looks gross i'ma be honest with you
it just doesn't look flattering or
pretty alright moving on we're going to
talk about some pink some first two that
I just didn't work for me was the Milani
metallics this one is matte about you
and it the quality is great the actual
color it's just too bright to have
shimmer in it for me personally another
one I didn't care for this one by
motives is high voltage and it's an all
day liquid lipstick but yeah it isn't
kiss proof and it's a little
tacky it feels like very gooey to me so
I definitely never reach for this one
it's a crime how many makeup wipes I'm
wasting over here oh I feel like we
talked about the gist of the liquid
lipsticks that I don't care for the ones
that I do love so now I wanna just talk
about a couple of different brands we're
going to talk about the pure liquid
lipsticks and the reason I haven't
talked about these yet is because
they're a little bit different than a
most liquid lipstick they're not kiss
proof and they never drive pulley so I
consider these more like a soft matte
lip cream and because it's whipped it's
not actually going to dry it out on your
lips and make your lips cracky or crusty
these are so easy to wear if you're
looking for something to wear to work or
do something easygoing - it's not going
to be high-maintenance you're not going
to have secret lips are falling apart
throughout the day I would opt for
something like this my peers are amazing
and it gave me a good discount code
output on the screen somewhere watching
my two favorite shades this is obsessed
in FBF FBF is the more Browning nude and
obsessed a Bobby pink color it doesn't
dry it still has a light whip filling it
ends up being somewhat matte but it's
not a actual liquid lipstick partyís
this is very nice beautiful products I
love them they're not liquid lipsticks
are more of a whip whip cream okay when
my favorite products bite are is their
lip paint and namaste it's my favorite I
wear it all the time it has a minty
smell to it and it applies very very
very evenly I love the way it feels on
my lips ciate liquid velvet apply
incredibly evenly they're super nice on
the lips however they're not as
lightweight and whipped they put a
little bit more glossy and I find that
they never dry down quite as Matt as I
would like them to because honey I like
my stuff I try to snap there's so much
grease in my hand it's like like myself
in my god lastly holy cow this videos
gonna be Eddy you're small you guys are
gonna kill me but lastly these are the
buxom wobbly lips and I feel like
they're the exact same situation as the
ciate so they never fully dry matte I
like them a lot they're great they apply
evenly they're not drying they're
lightweight on the lips but you're never
going to get that full flat matte
with it they always have a shine Mahina
l-- and they never drive fully but
they're just whipped so whenever you see
whipped is typically gonna be like a
soft matte lip cream like the ones my
neck okay guys for my liquid lipstick
collection these are my nudes on this
side and then on the other side I have
my pinks I just have the various brands
that I kind of went through in the video
Stila I mustachioed as a color la girl
Milani some of my pure minerals are in
there to face and then this is my more
Bobby pink side I reach for these in the
news the most honestly so I have the
most of these colors I have some Oprah
this is a new one from the meny
collection which I love love love his
collection which is now permanent this
is the Kylie Jenner I have a little dose
of colors on Stasha is still a few a
pure and yeah so now we'll talk about
some of my Reds and I kind of keep some
Pink's as well on this side of this
little tray - I don't have too many red
so it's a smaller tray but I just have
my you a Kylie Jenner some Oprah some -
face down in here and then the other
side I just have some Revlon and some la
girl different brands of pinks
alright this box is kind of random I try
to put in an order but I'll just went to
hell on this I have crazy colors like
blue purple oranges colors I don't reach
for that often and I don't have a lot of
there's a black and just random darker
colors and then on this side I keep most
of my Browns for whatever reason the
lipstick market every brand released a
new brown and for whatever reason I
decided to get it and look how cute
those little trays of bright pink this
is like bubblegum pink at my jeffree
star alum a chipper star some ziwei some
honest Osseo some le girls to faith and
these are just bright Pink's I don't
wear a bright pink that much so I don't
have that many of them so here are my
pure minerals lippies these are all the
shades and you can use the code Laurel
or 25 for 25% off which is a pretty big
deal but I've really been loving these
lately and I will have them linked down
below next up is bucks on these are the
Wadley whips I think I have all the
shades and I'm
you sure about all the shades but they
do have a lot of them I know it's clear
Trey I had the CIT liquid velvet and the
scardiest lip paints by Tarte these
remind me so much of each other that I
just threw him in here together but like
I said namaste isn't a favorite but both
brands have like a lot of pretty pinks a
lot of pretty news a lot of maroon it's
just a great color arrangement so that's
it for this video I hope it was helpful

lipsticks that don't work for me and the
ones that do work for me thank you guys
