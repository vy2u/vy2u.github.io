I'll be announcing the winner in another
video so anyways we're going to jump
right in and get started we're going to
talk about some the NYX products and I
hope you're ready okay what I think I'm
going to do in this video is go back and
forth one product I love one product I
don't love so much you know he's the
video interesting first you know I think
it would be good to start let me start
with something I love and actually been
loving to total control and NYX
foundation now I only like to wear this
on days where I don't want full coverage
because I don't personally like to build
it up that much I feel like I don't know
I'm like dripping so much product and
like trying to like work it in and build
it up and it's just too much work for
what it's worth so I just really like to
stick to this foundation whenever I like
a light to medium coverage of thing
going on there with my skin but I like
the way it sits on my skin I like
applying it to my skin all that is is
good with it and I really like the brush
I like using the brush with it I do
recommend getting the brush with it it's
a good paracin and really helps you
apply the product because it's so
liquidy the little divot in the brush it
makes it perfect for application I have
a full review on this if you haven't
seen it oh my gosh alright so let's talk
about a product I don't like and it just
happens to be on my eyes so I did this I
look because I wanted to do something
different for once
like switch it up a little fitted white
eyeliner and I love mixed eyeliners but
they're colored liners are so
inconsistent and patchy and they dry out
so quickly and express this especially a
special way the vivid brights are so
cracky when these first came out I try
to do this cool like ombre fading liner
and I was getting it right but every
time the liner would dry it would start
dispersing and cracking and looking
crazy and I saw these cool Instagram
pictures with people doing cool looks
with these and I'm like how because my
neck cracks all in it like I don't
understand is it dry it was just like
busted to cry so I tried this one today
do the white liner looks forgetting that
happens with these and I immediately was
like dear God here we go hey there's no
telling what's up with it so then I just
ended up using which these are better
the mix I use actually two things work
the other one out I can't find it but I
ended up using the next the pin which
these are really good which we can go
ahead and jump into products I do like I
like the liner pins these are really
good and I use the toothpaste little
liner thing to go over the top so it
would get really even because girl just
while I'm talking about liners when my
favorite liners on the market happens to
be the NYX this is the all-black this is
a skinny mascara so this is something
different it's I don't know why I guess
whenever they put the color formula into
the liquid it just starts dispersing
because I never have that problem with
the black this is a super easy part to
apply it doesn't this is not it this is
a skinny mascara guys it has been a long
day forgive me okay I can't find it now
great but it is the next map it's a
skinny matte black liner and you love
that I think it's great and then some of
the line I was just two piece for me so
anyways onto a product that I don't like
is the new away.we glow liquid
highlighters I think that they move
around your foundation and product way
too much for what it's worth because you
barely get any highlight
highlight out of it now if you're all
there for so highlight you might like
these better but just a warning I just
find that once you blend them out like
they move they pick up your foundation
and move it around and then it didn't
really show up in pictures it was like
barely glow I mean I guess it's like a
really pretty subtle glow but really it
was barely there for me and it was just
way more trouble than what it was worth
trying to get all this blended out from
barely a glove you know what I mean so
I'm not a big fan of these but I do what
I do like better would work but what I
do actually like is the bright idea this
is the illuminating stick and I find
that it doesn't move around your makeup
as much and you get way more of a
highlight now they have a few different
shades in these but they just enough
blend out into a powder rather than
being super creamy and this will give
you like a bronzy glow like I said they
have different colors in them and
they're just so pretty and I feel like
you get more of more color more
highlight out of these so these are a
really nice product from next now
something else that didn't work out for
me
I'm going to talk about some of these so
I actually love the NYX ombre blushes
but this color didn't work out for me
and it kind of made me look I got look
like I got punched in the face
it is this shade right cheer the shade
just it was pure orange and then I guess
looking like a punch in the face isn't a
good term to use but it Ouma it just was
it really made me look like I had rubbed
dirt on my face this one was a little
bit patchy on me and not only that it
was just a terrible blush shade so this
is new to me I almost think it would
look better as a bronzer but still it's
just got too much orange in it to be a
bronzer so I really couldn't stand this
one and then the shimmer and it just
like made the patchiness so much worse
than what was so I actually hated that
one but one that I love is called
strictly chic so pretty just a gorgeous
peach color and I find that this one has
like left that shimmer and it's a little
more matte so it seems like it wants to
blend out wait easier on the skin
I don't really tap into the highlighting
much because I find that it just kind of
makes them patchy but I mean I in
general love these blushes is also
another powder
and love from Nexus the matte bronzer is
so green just to like let you know a
little bit goes a long way like these
are very pigmented they're not still
compact where you can get any products
we can't get any products they always
have had trouble with that in the past
this isn't all around really great
drugstore bronzer and I highly recommend
it to you guys and then this is just
another pretty Lobby purpley blush from
them that I liked a lot this one's
called mauve me and actually think this
will be a very pretty I show as well
it's purpley but like all my skin tone
it comes off as more of a ma be like a
deeper pink color that is disgusting
literally you guys are probably staring
at my hands and what's going on there so
I actually burned my hand so bad or my
arm I was getting a pizza all the oven
and like the tray slipped off the little
pot holders and it landed right on my
arm like my arm caught it and oh girl
that's nasty so we'll just and then
another part I really love for mix or
their next longer is our the next
lingeries these are the best they're not
too drawing but I do recommend like
after a couple hours wearing them to
maybe touch them up because they're so
hard to get off the list it's almost
unreal just kind of love/hate thing with
these I love them though for real they
dry down completely mad and and I think
that they're so pretty they just get
almost a little bit goopy which we don't
want to come off your lip so you have to
touch them up but other than that it's
fabulous this is my favorite color in it
at all it's called satin ribbon these
are always sold out so if you can't get
your hands on them definitely take the
time to grab one because you will need
it in your life so luckily there are
more products that I love than I hate
from NYX we'll have another love I love
this palette so much I think it's
seriously one of the prettiest palettes
that NICUs NYX has made this is the a
vant pop palette and I've downloaded a
lot of colors and I actually use this in
quite a few drugstore tutorials on my
channel
I think this quality of these eyeshadows
are of a high end
and even the shimmers and the math
they're just equal quality they're so
pretty
and they blend out seamlessly and I love
the arrangement of colors maybe I wish
there were a few more Browns in it but
still like you can get so many good
looks out of this palette and the pans
are big and also you get your money's
worth this is a great eyeshadow palette
and a Haley are committed to you guys
and one last thing I don't write which
like I'm so scatterbrained today guys
I'm so sorry the reason I had this up
here on my desk and I was holding up the
wrong product is because I was going to
mention acid dislike it is this little
skinny mascara and they have like it's
like a dupe to the higher-end brand once
it's just a tight line but in my opinion
these are just so gimmicky like
literally if you just wiggle your
mascara one you get the same result as
tight lining with some little wand that
looks like this it's just I get another
step to add in your makeup routine and I
personally have tried several of these
out and I don't care for any of them in
order to I here for this one and like I
said I just really wiggling your mascara
one you can get at the base of your
lashes without having to apply three
different mascaras to like get the
complete look you know it's just a
little gimmicky and a waste of time for
me so I'm not about it but that's it for
this video thank you guys so much for
watching and being here you know I love
you guys so so much and comment down
below your favorite product from nigs or
maybe a product that didn't work out
from your NYX and I'll catch you all in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
