channel today's video is very exciting
because today it's a giveaway video and
it's time to get back to you guys I
promise you guys a really really big way
for a long time and finally I put it
together so you guys are first probably
really interested to see what the heck
is the price well I decided to pick 21
winners basically I had saved up a bunch
of makeup that's brand new and you guys
know I get so much in PR that I can't
use and so much extra makeup that I buy
and I decided to give it back to you
guys I also donate the shelter's just so
you know I just donated a ton of clothes
shoes and - no three big target like
huge bags packed to the top of brand new
makeup to a shelter and I also want to
give it back to you guys the guys who
support me so with that being said I
have a huge ulcer right here something
I'm talking like I'm grinding my jaw a
little bit as - I don't rub the old sir
and it hurts ok let's go over the prices
I have 20 different prizes of makeup and
I've a category of 20 different little
sections that I'm showing you now and
it's just full of foundations concealers
highlighters you name it every brand
every makeup and I kind of split up
where everybody gets just a touch of
skincare you know a touch of eye makeup
touch a lip makeup and all kinds and
stuff like that and that way we have a
nice assortment of makeup again it is in
20 pounds and 20 winners so you're
probably like well what is the 21st
place winner the 21st place winner is a
MacBook from Apple you guys are always
so grateful whenever I do a macbook
giveaway and I figured it would be
really great to include a Mac look for a
pro for the 21st owners that would be
the last winner and those are the prizes
so I hope you guys are super excited
about that with that being said let's

I always find it very very very
important to give back to you guys and

pressure on people at Christmastime for

and getting your best friends gifts it's
a lot of pressure so if you win when
these prizes feel free to have an idea
and use it as a Christmas present and
help alleviate the pressure off of your
wallet so hopefully this will help out
some families and people who have to get
a lot of gifts for Christmastime

alleviate some of that off your wallet I
know it gets expensive so with that
being said thank you again for all the
