video is going to be a very what I would
like to call different video I'm going
to be reviewing something which I
thought about not reviewing on my
channel but now if I am I'm gonna review
it so I bought these highlighters a long
time ago they are from bitch-slap
Cosmetics calm they are graphic some has
tips on them and some has wee-wees oh
yeah I just called it a wee wait I want
to know if they actually work they come
in this clear packaging by the way and
they're just metal pans you could put in
a Z palette if you wanted to and I saw
these also saw the lipstick lipsticks um
and I have those with me but I was going
to review them instead I'm nerv you the
highlights mani MUA it reviewed the
lipstick so if you want to see that
video you guys know mani you know where
his channels out you know where he's
lurking on the Internet
bitch-slap Cosmetics is coming out with
a bunch of different it for lack of
better words perverted makeup but not
all this perverted see they have a
Pokemon they're just graphic honestly a
makeup products and it's interesting and
it's like is it a gimmick or does the
makeup actually work if it's worth the
toot or so it just for looks we're gonna
be testing it out today it's also
hilarious I mean can we all just can we
all just lighten the mood together in
this video just lighten your serious
mood with me just lift it up and laugh a
little boobs
there's tits on my highlight as well as
penis come on now by the way this one's
name is deep throat I just caught it
with my fingernail that's great this
one's name is deep throat and NARS has
been naming their makeup perverted names
deep throat I think is a name of an
artist blush so I mean if he can't get
offended by the name if you're over here
putting NARS all over your face trying
to subscribe to my channel before you
leave because I'm always doing weird
crazy things and um I would like for you
to join me doing the weird crazy things
okay we're gonna jump right in the video
let's get started right starting out
basically I don't have a highlighter on
as you can see like there's no highlight
there's a little residue from a
highlight left up there we got to get it
off I'm going to try out the boob one
first is gold and it looks beautiful so
I'm going to use this cheek over here to
try out the boob when the boob one is
called boob job bitch bitch slap
cosmetics calm the pan size is pretty
large so you do get a lot of product
they feel like they move around very
easily so you got to be careful and they
have like very little dots of pink in it
which I don't think it's gonna make that
much difference I'm gonna run my brush
across it like that see it kind of
messes it up oh you get like so much
product actually don't recommend running
your brush across it like this heavy
hand it is I did let's do it oh my god
yeah that's a brush swipe that's not
even a finger swipe so these these are
really pigmented I'm going to take
what's left on my brush we're going to
test her out yeah that is a lot of
product so these are very pigmented Wow
and this one is an EO six brush from
Sigma it's a new brush I'm going to get
just like like I'm literally just going
and getting a smidge bit more look I'm
just going to apply it that is golden
honey that's super pigmented honestly um
my skin tone it almost looks a little
bit yellow it's a little too golden for
me but with that being said I could see
me mixing this product into a bronzer
and getting a really sunny smooth bronzy
look with shimmer to it but wearing it
on its own it's just a little bit too
golden for me but there's no doubt that
this is a very pigmented product not
only is it just boobs you know on your
stuff it's also very pigmented we are
going to switch brushes and test out the
wee-wee highlighter next the we we do we
have another highlight brush in here I
know we do since I've now realized how
pigmented these are I'm going to take
deep throat the little penis I'm going
to take my fan brush this is the f42
brush and I'm just going to swivel her
Wow
I mean these are like crazy look lots of
lots of speckles going on but that's
because I'm using a fan brush and you
normally get more foofy fallout I want
to say for lack of better words whenever
you use a fan brush that's just
something you can count on so on my hand
because it is a fan brush you get a
little bit of a lighter pigment from it
yes this cheek I'm like what cheek and
my trying out so here I go trying out
mr. wee-wee on this cheek do you see
like that's super pigmented it's pretty
the wee-wee appears that is not quite as
pigmented um it is pigmented though
let me try I'm scared to try with
another brush that's like the other
brushes just take it too hard you know
heavy-handed let's try this Real
Techniques brush yeah this one's just
lighter in general this one is just like
a lighter more subtle a little bit more
of a wearable highlight the blue you can
barely tell the little golden why does
these Eagle claws keep getting into
everything I really like the penis the
gold a little too gold the penis is a
little more subtle if you can tell give
another friend to try out and his name
is Pikachu oh my god they had to go and
name it polka ho like one you got a name
at that you got Pikachu something good
and great in the world you went and
named it polka ho that don't do that
I'm gonna take my f-35 brush and I'm
gonna swirl around mr. polka ho-oh
messing them up it makes me so sad and
again it's like a lot it's like flying
in the air I'm inhaling it a lot of
product going everywhere holy Shh
Oh yo y'all oh this one is this one is
insane I had to turn my phone on silent
oka ho
I would deaf I like a frosted cupcake
over here Coco is definitely the most
intense one out of all of them then we
have the boob job which is very intense
and golden and we have this one that's a
little more wearable called deep throats
a little wee-wee I think these would
actually be a hilarious gift if it was
like a bridal shower or like the what's
it called the bachelorette party like
you gave the boobs and penises I don't
know the girls might actually like and
what is like for Christmas like your
friend loves Pikachu and stuff
her nose will look like a frosted
cupcake for the whole year all right so
my overall review of these are they work
they're darn well pigmented they're
perverted the names are nasty and you
get a lot of product do you guys think
of them let me
in the comments I forgot to tell you how
much I've paid for them are 25 bucks
apiece 22 20 note there yeah they're 20
to 25 bucks apiece
and they come out a little bit different
than what they look like online if you
see Pikachu has like a bit more yellow
in them and then Pikachu only came like
a little bit of splash of yellow on them
so they come out just a wee bit
different than they do online as I'll
have the JJ which is what it's called
it's a vagina so if you want to Aegina
highlight it's there for you for this
video thank you guys so much for being
here and watching I hope you enjoyed it
was a little bit different and I'll see
you all in my next video I hope you have
an awesome day we know what that means
yes yes that doesn't mean bye bye bye
bye bye see you later bye guys
how now brown cow how now brown cow Oh
fix my hair to act like I'm all put
together but we both know I'm not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
