have come here to learn about the movie
I'm really excited to share with you
guys this video because you know it's
it's a hard subject to talk about on
YouTube because it's boobs and it's like
a part of body that people don't like
talk about know we all want to wear
those outfits where we need to tape up
our boobs and I'm gonna simulate how to
do that but I'm going to keep a bra on
but I'll still show you how and it works
really well and I'll show you like
before and afters I'm really excited to
do this video for you guys I also have a
lot of boob hacks to show you that you
probably don't know about be sure to
watch Captain machine before you leave I
do lots of hacks adduce three videos a
week so I don't want you to miss out on
all the fun
let's jump right in and talk about our
boobage for hack number one it is a bra
double up so instead of one bra that's
right where to I know this seems a
little bit weird and a little bit much
and I know that my bra has a lot of lint
on it we're going to bypass that it will
uplift your girls as well as make them
look much larger for our next hack is
going to be boob tape instead of boob
tape we're actually going to be using
app letting tape to tape this side of
our boot for those low-cut shirts so I'm
going to be doing this with a bra on
like I said in the intro we're going to
tape it to the side of the boob and the
most important step is to pull upward
taping it around the side you really
want to start under the boob and pull
upward you're going to really uplift
that boob and that way it won't be
slouchy and you can also go ahead and
cover your nipple if you want to that
way it won't be poking through you can
tell a huge difference right here one
boob is much more uplifted than the
other and also it gives the fabric
something to grab onto that way doesn't
slip
around the next hack is gonna be for
those boobs that hang low kind of like
my boobs
they like to hang low yeah so what I'm
going to do is start underneath the boob
I'm going to take athletic tape tape it
from one side and pull underneath the
boob up and tape it into the armpit I'm
going to repeat this until basically I
have covered the hole underneath of the
boob it will lift your boobs to the high
heavens it is amazing and perfect if you
don't want to wear a bra out I got you
covered girl next is for contouring the
boob okay I have a full video on
contouring and highlighting your boobs
it is amazing it works very well if
you're not comfortable wearing makeup on
your chest don't but for those of you
who are contouring your boobs is a fun
way just to add and enhance a little bit
more dimension and make it look like you
have more cleavage even if you don't you
might not want to hug your date and rub
all over your date but it looks really
good one - splint it out this isn't
something that I do on the regular
because have a pretty large size breasts
but the option is there for you and I
will have this video linked in the
description box so check E&amp;amp;A alright
next is for double sided tape it's
expensive and kind of hard to find
sometimes double side tape buy scotch
tape is legit the best double-sided tape
it works so well all you do is stick it
to your skin and stick your fabric to
the other side of it that way you don't
have a nip slip your clothes don't go
crazy sliding every whichaway it's a
really simple hat just take your clothes
down double-sided tape the next one is
olive oil so actually putting off this
tape on your skin you don't want to pull
it off and hurt your skin I've seen
people use duct tape on your boobs I
really don't recommend it if you rub a
little bit of olive oil around the tape
it will seriously just fall off like
slough off so don't go to like an Olive
old party they're going to be taping
your boobs
next is massaging yeah boobs olive oil
has fatty acids and antioxidants in it
massaging it in to your boobs is a
chemical free way to
haier your cells which repairs any
damage done to your boots I'm not going
to do it on camera because that would be
really weird thank you guys so much for
watching make sure to subscribe before
you leave and I'll see you all in my
next video bye guys
Hayward was here with KBC news okay
cookie goal and they're good for your
nipples
