life comes at you fast we are like
blades of grass we come to finding time
with welcome to my beauty room so the
first thing that you'll see whenever you
walk in is this picture that says be
amazing and whatever you're trying to
conquer the whole entire world honey you
got to be amazing so I got this at
t.j.maxx and it's been with me for a
long time then you will see these lakh
shelves from Ikea I don't know if they
discontinued these or not if they didn't
I'll definitely put them up but I mean
I'll put them in the description but we
just have an arrow on the top and then
we had these little is DIY jars that I
have a video on but it's super old I
just to keep all my perfumes I just have
a few different I don't have that big of
a perfume collection
I mostly collect the roller balls I just
have Juicy Couture's Prada Tory Burch
some Pacifica Hello Kitty I have all my
sample ones love this area show down I
have this little name card that I got in
an event and I just thought it was so
beautiful this was my seating card and
so I just stole my seating card kind of
janky but you know I do mean and then
this book is a Chanel fashion book the
little book of Chanel's what it's called
and it is from Z Gallerie
I have my two-faced little black book of
bronzers in a full makeup collection
video but I will show you really quickly
that I just have all of my colour-pop
liquid lipsticks in these two and then I
have some of my favorite lipsticks right
there
heck shelf I have this really cool
spinning lipstick tower from Zara beauty
and then I just have a candle holder
from earthbound and a couple of my
favorite magazines right there that I've
already looked over and then this is
just a mess down here I just keep some
products I want to try out and once
we've moved past the lack show I have
this massive like look how tall this
closet is closet here you can kind of
the room and it's mirrored and I love it
I typically don't take selfies in it but
I just have this little wall area right
here where I keep this adorable cheetah
print bench which is from a flea market
my mother-in-law that's a ping-pong ball
down there for the cats to play with my
mother-in-law snagged this for me for a
heck of a pride the two pillows are from
Target though and I paid a stupid amount
for this product post right here I paid
250 for it I think I'm at sea which just
for the poster and then I just got a
frame for it but I just love it and I
really want to get like two things to go
on either side of it I just haven't
found the perfect thing so it's pretty
blank over here now we'll talk about my
desk getting a lot of backlight from the
window but I'll just go over this area
and let me adjust the lighting all right
now the lining is all kinds of gross and
like dark and oranjee but sorry about
that this is the desk area it's a pretty
thin long desk and it is from Amazon but
it is an Ikea desk I just got the
shipping for free when I ordered it off
Amazon whenever I try to get off IKEA
this shipping almost cost as much as the
duck so I was like nothing queue over
here I just have this little clear
container from the Container Store and
just some products that I really love to
use on the regular just some oils mac's
fix+ I got me two bottles of it just
finished one off some primer water
kabuki and then just some moisturizers
that I live and then I have this lamp
here which is from a flea market now
bama that's where I got a lot of my
decor stuff and I just took it with me
to California flowers from TJ Maxx and
that little trinket jar right here with
q-tips in it so hard to see cuz the
backlight my grandpa gave me
it is so vintage there's no telling how
long he had that and then I just
a little back brush cleaner hanging out
the opposite side of my desk is where I
keep my brushes and I have this little L
which is from Hobby Lobby this is one of
my favorite candle it's pronounced Valle
you spa but let me tell you if you smell
this one it'll change your life and I'll
kill your bank account because these
candles are away from Christ in my
opinion
alright so then I just have my brushes
and these are just I shadow brushes face
brushes and then I have this pin holder
from Target from their office selection
and I just keep all of my face brushes
they are ok and they need a little bad
but I typically spot clean my brushes so
what's in the drawers giving you a quick
overview of the first two or they open
up really wide and they're pretty deep
drawers so they're really nice for
storage and I will show you what since
only but I have this obsession with
liquid lipsticks as a new anastacio
Beverly Hills ones and I made this out
of a package which Patrick Starr has a
video on how to do this and that's where
I got the idea I just have some sponges
and beauty blenders this Vera Mona color
switch will my charity pot moisturizer
and this little thing I have some
products that I live this is my NARS an
ellipse de Saint Laurent root or /
number 10
stick me really will because you know
your girls lips get the coffin my nude
sticks and then some new items from Jeju
a from the eyes I want to try out I have
this emergency mini kid I had at glam
life gurus which is taught to dinner and
it
so cute and I just have some new
lipsticks from quiete I think isn't Rory
I never say anything right and then I
just have boo qoodles of facial white
literally I just have all kinds of
brands have specific and Neutrogena
Murad and then some bozo and then back
here is a big color switch pad like the
color switch wheel that's the pad okay
and our next chore is more so supplies
than beauty products I try to put them
in separate drawers so I'm doing
construction outside of they ruin my
video it's gonna be sure I got these
containers from TJ mags these clear
dividers and there were 12 dollars or so
cheap then I have this little tray this
white tray from Target from the bathroom
section where I just keep oh my god so
right over here I keep just my sharpies
in my pins and then back here this is
thank-you note so if you guys write me a
letter my pube box I always like to try
to write you guys back
I had my planner a lens that came on my
canon that's my stock lens which I try
not to use too often cuz it's not my
favorite and then I just have these
little organizers with paper clips I
have a Tarte lip scrub right there
that's a J cat's sharpener and a Sephora
portable phone charger and then back
there is just memory cars and camera
pieces and then these are paper clips
and then I have my little hair trimmer
right there which I just mentioned in my
favorites as well as my bow show
blotting wipes this is a fun camera
which I'm going to use for my birthday
dinner and then I have some mints by XO
those are delicious they might show up
on Sephora I don't know this is my
business drawer let's talk about the
sure I pizza for wall in my room
funny story about this wall is have
acted so for did not inspire this wall
and I never even associated with a
support wall until I posted out and all
you guys are like so horrible and I was
like oh my gosh this is literally a
support wall what inspired it was a
control Pinterest and I thought about
four years ago and I pinned it in I kept
it and ever since I saw that picture I
had this dream of having a black and
white striped wall and I knew my beauty
room would be my moment to do it and
then I did it and it's a support wall
which I love that I mean this is a
makeup room so hello
the pictures are from Etsy they were
only five bucks a piece the friends are
from Z gallery which I got off clearance
for a heck of a day I wanted to mention
the rug and the chair and the pillow
pillows from Target
rug is from TJ Maxx which was only fifty
bucks because these rows this is faux
fur of course but these rooms are really
expensive and that chair was like 19
bucks from Ikea
try to find it and that is the day all
right so this is the area that you
typically see in the background of my
videos and I'm going to answer some
questions for you guys as far as where
the stuff that you see comes from and
like why I have it like this so let's
talk about this bench can we just can we
just have a moment of silence if so if
you want to get it for 99 bucks at
HomeGoods the desk gets from Target
comes so cheap and rickety has no doors
that come in it but it is from the
targets like college section and it was
51 now let's chitchat about what's on
the dead this is warm tobacco pipe
candle and a lot before like does that
smell good it smells nothing like
tobacco it smells weird it felt spicy
but not like tobacco I got this candle
here from Francesca's boutique I just
love the jar this is from home goods
this is from TJ Maxx this little piece
is actually from TJ Maxx and I have gone
through it in my makeup collection video
about what's in it
some bulk makeup product those yellow
flowers are there from TJ Maxx and then
I just have another one of my favorite
overpriced
candles and this one is in Baltic amber
I get these at Anthropologie if you're
wondering where to purchase them and
then I have this little apothecary from
TJ Maxx it's empty I used to keep lip
glosses in it but I was like me I'll
change it so then I have these flowers
that are from TJ Maxx this frame is from
Z Gallerie which I'll live it in yes
that is a picture indeed of mankini
Johnson about two years ago
she's what got me into YouTube and I
just really respect her because I've
seen her in mini settings and met her a
few times and she's always the same
person she's not fake she's not
pretending to be this person it's who
she is and I just love her for it then I
have this piece right here which I've
gotten multiple questions on where I
bought it guys this is just a face chart
from Mac sometimes if you ask the
employees they'll give you one my friend
actually gives me these she works there
and I just did this with my makeup the
little lights you see are just for the
background of the video not really I
don't look good close-up but these are
from Urban Outfitters or Anthropologie
sells them to the anti picture I love
the gold detailing that it just gives
this area like that pop of metallic and
the shelves that it's sitting on our
from Home Depot they were actually
really cheap so yeah you're just got to
go in their home decor section and then
the flowers of course I come to shame at
first you see this really chic art
picture and me at the me right event
they had artist draws and I just love
how it's so chic and I just framed it
and it's kind of narcissus but you know
don't judge me I have another of these
volume spa candles up here I'm top on
top of my original beauty box I love
them is the best clear beauty boxes from
original beauty box and it is packed
full and now this is my little trinket
and jewelry section on the other
akia nigel little thing is from
earthbound a little tree thing and I
just bracelets and earrings and like
little knuckle rings in those I love my
trinkets and then this little clear
necklace holder is from Target and it
was 19 bucks so it's pretty affordable
and I just hang my metallic necklaces so
it kind of matches overall that's what
that area looks like and then I have my
overcrowded Alex 9 drawers which I can
give you a little peek into I mean I
want you there just like kind of
overcrowded with makeup but they were
more organized for my makeup collection
videos if you want to see that of course
I'll have it in the description box for
you to click on this is a frame that I
got at a yard sale and then I put gold
scrapbooking paper in the background and
then Christina from GA who's the founder
I mean this gorgeous piece that just
says congrats on the 200k subscribers I
love little pieces like this they mean a
lot to me so I try to cherish them and
keep them to remember the moment thought
I was sharing this bracelet as well I
typically have it on my arm but so Ben
glory had this made for me this is the
date I hit 200k and they sent it to me
and literally I almost cried just
because it's so sentimental and it means
a lot to me I know I care so much about
