today's video is going to be a 360 video
so you can go ahead and take your mouse
or finger on your phone and swipe around
and you can see a 360 view of my area
and I'm going to take you on one of the
many adventures I went on in Belize I
went there with Sonia Kochi and Kristin
Dominique right now we are getting on a
boat to go swimming with sharks and
doing a little bit of snorkeling in
Belize we had a lot of fun doing this we
did several adventures they split the
video footage up into adventure so I got
swimming with sharks so that is what's
on my channel but the other channels
have the other adventures on them if you
want to check that out right now you are
viewing the boat ride take this out into
the water to swim with the shark eyes
who's ready to get in with the charts
come on it's ready
here is what it looks like with us
swimming in the water I'm sorry guys
there's not a lot of close-up footage
the 360 camera is not a normal camera
and doesn't shoot like I do on my other
vlog so this is a different type of
video it's kind of like a still shot
situation where you can't move the
camera around but you move around the
camera and here is the guys that took us
on the tour feeding the shark so usually
was not a zillion alone the reason we're
not in the water is because we had swam
for so long before the Sharks came out
so we are well we are exhausted and so
we're just like look I'm gonna take a
picture for you guys on snapchat but I
can say I did swim with sharks whenever
I went to Bora Bora so that pretty much
sums up our day out on the water this is
my first time in Belize and if you're
wondering Laura haven't seen you in
Belize in a long time yes this footage
was actually shot in September I'm sorry
this video is going up so light from the
time that it actually happened but I
think I was there in September this year
so we are on the boat ride right back to
the island and this is me getting off
the boat
and I figured I would add in a couple
shots of the swimsuits I wore while I
was there and so I will link them all
down below in the description box if you
want to check them out except for my
black police when that one was a gift so
I don't have it but we ended the trip by
letting lanterns off the pier
some of them didn't make it all the way
off but we had a good time thank you
guys so much for being here watching be
sure to subscribe before you leave bye
