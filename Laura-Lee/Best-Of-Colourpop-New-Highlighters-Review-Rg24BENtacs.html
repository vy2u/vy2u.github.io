hello okay we're gonna pretend that it's
not there you don't see that hump oh hey
guys welcome to my channel today's video
is going to be colour pot talk I have a
lot of product from colour-pop and I
think it's such a great brand and it
needs to be talked about as much as
possible because the prices are so
affordable it's cheaper than drugstore
makeup it has the quality of high-end
makeup and you just don't come across
stuff like that often I thought it with
you a dedicated video talking about my
top favorite best products from
colour-pop that I'm loving the most is
that way if you do in order now exactly
just get like what I what I think is
good but I can just like advise you to
really great products that love so much
from colour-pop what seriously I do in
order on that site like every other week
ok it's becoming a problem if you want
to know what products are my favorites
from colour-pop well then just keep
watching first we need to get the
elephant out of the room and go ahead
and discuss the where the light please
and discuss where the light is by
kathleenlights she's a fellow youtuber
so I want to talk about her little quad
first of all the thing I love most about
her quad is you get to shimmers and then
you get to Matt the other thing I like
about it so much is that the colors are
very versatile and they are super
neutral so you can basically mix and
match oh man wear them and make a lot of
different looks with them that is very
wearable you never felt a sugar pop or
sugar pop what you've never felt a color
pop I said before it's a very creamy
like squishy squishy texture it's very
strained it it's extremely pigmented
don't say it in warned you take a shower
is is like crazy hard all for these
colors are just little gems and I think
that like if you bought this this whole
thing right here like her kit that you
would get use out of every single color
so this is definitely a favorite of mine
that's why I'm here recommending it to
you yeah girl have just a few more
eyeshadows I feel like you need in your
life if you do do in order from them so
the first one is get lucky I've done a
tutorial with this one and it blew me Oh
how beautiful it was oh my goodness
get lucky it's a gold color but it's
like it's not a yellow gold it's a gold
gold which makes absolutely no sense but
they're with me we can understand this
together it's just a super SuperDuper
shimmery gold like a pair of gold
earrings gold there we go
I definitely think you need get lucky in
your life Hey all right and if you're
looking for like more so a fun color to
wear but not like a crazy colored wear I
love bubbly oh it's so cute
okay so bubbly is a metallic and it is
it does have a lot of glitter in it and
it is light pink but I just feel like it
gives your eyes that pop that you could
be looking for something in jazz up your
eyeshadow to get you out of the norm
again only five dollars I mean you're
not really losing money if you don't use
it every day but bubbly I warm quite a
few times and I always get compliments
because it puts a little bit of a
sparkle on my eye and it really catches
the light such a pretty color that was
my cat that opens the door hey baby girl
now I'm going to talk blushes with you
and I have to which I picked two out of
a bunch of them that was really hard to
do but if I had to only pick two it
would be these two so the first one and
they're kind of similar okay first one
is birthday suit oh my gosh and by the
way if you don't fill the lids on these
tight it says in the packaging they'll
dry out I lost two blushes because I
didn't fill the freaking lid oh it was
devastating this one is birthday suit
and it is oh it is a mob pink color now
I always go for a mob Pete because no
matter what makeup look you're doing
whether you have purple eyes neutral eye
blue i gold eye a mob blush color is
gonna match and it's gonna flow with a
look so you just don't have to put any
thinking power into what blush you're
wearing if you have birthday suits
because and it's a good universal blush
I think any time you get like a really
good neutral e-ma be pink it looks good
on like 99% of skin tones so Hey Girl
hey oh shoot I picked three blushes no
ah no I picked here the quarters is the
other one and now quarter she has a
little bit of warmth to it it is another
it's not Mavi I wouldn't say but it's
definitely it almost reminds me um we're
guys I'm buying ours a little bit
because
almost has like this iridescent sheen in
it and it definitely puts a glow on your
skin these are both statins but this one
just comes off to me a little bit more
with a little bit more of a glow and I
love love love love love the glow so
it's like a peachy pink with a glow oh
my god I'm so excited to talk about
these I can't I contain your excitement
Laura we had a video to film when I talk
to you guys about their highlighters I
have two of them and I'm gonna recommend
both of them to you because oh okay oh
and they're both like different colors
so this one's gonna be more warming
colored and then this one's more of like
a champagne color one of those annoying
people's that when they get their nails
and they tap on everything so annoying
first one is spoon I love the names on
them they're like so off the wall random
like spoon huh this is the champagne one
it does have a little bit of a glitter
in it but once you get it out on your
cheeks it's more it turns into more of a
shine like hello you're Lea eight miles
away and you can see it from over here
so yeah my gosh let me film my video
buddy what are you doing because I had
to tell you something else before God
what I had to tell you right moving
along spoon anyway since the champagne
iridescent reminds me a little bit of
opal by Becca cosmetics but it could be
a dupe for it I haven't tested that out
yeah but these are eight dollars yeah
second one is called highly waste wasted
waited wasted and highly wasted now this
one is some more warm peachy one and oh
my god they're so soft I could just like
rub them all day so awkward this one has
like a gold hue to it and I think that
you could go without a blush and just
wear this because it just has so much
pigment and color in it rather than just
shine like it's an actual color and it's
almost like a bronzy gold color in it
really love it so these two highlighters
are awesome alright and lastly they
don't cover eyeshadows blush highlight
okay lastly I want to talk to you guys
about their lip products I have three of
their lippie stix that I want to
into you guys and they are all
completely three different colors like
completely
the first one is cookie cookie it's a
great great great nude for it this one
was a dupe for honey love I think by Mac
yeah buddy this one oh my gosh like a
mob new color it has a lot of brown
undertone in it so it's not like a white
out nude color you're actually going to
get some coloring on your lip I like to
wear this one and put a little bit of
myth by Mac in the center of it which is
a white out nude color and it just kind
of gives you that faded ombre effect on
your lip it's really beautiful I just
want to say that the formula of these is
very creamy I have extremely dry lips so
these work out really well with my dry
lips the next one I want to mention to
you and I have its matching lip liner
this one is pepper I mentioned this one
in my favorites video for April
so pepper is our Barbie pink color oh
lady sees and gentlemen if you're a pink
where you have found your match this is
pepper by color pop died I die I die I
die I die I die the last one oh and by
the way they have the lip liners that
match so that's Pepper's lip liner and
the next one is el bebé which if you
are a vampy lady or you want to get into
vampy lip products you can spend five
dollars and try it out if you don't like
it it's not a whole lot of money wasted
like what and we'll move on in super
super creamy and it looks like cranberry
very pretty now this is more of a color
for a full time and I know it's
summertime right now but I wanted to
just recommend what I liked not by you
know the season just in general what I
like from the brand so I definitely like
LBB very beautiful a cranberry color
this is like a showstopper color like if
you wear this and did a nude or neutral
eye you'll be like popping that is it
