alcohol sorry if there's an echo I still
have anything hanging on my walls and
it's very bare and my background is
different and not the best way because
it's kind of boring now I just moved and
I ordered everything that I need for my
beauty room but it isn't here yet so for
like two weeks my videos are gonna be it
lime sauce just know I'm working on it
then
got lots of new days at all that I want
to share with you I am so happy that
you're here to see them besides me
moving and having a boring background
that was about it oh my god that lack
show oh somebody needs to do some
cleaning first thing that I got was the
Dr Lin
there's six pieces to the Dr Lin
skincare collection and I got the six
pieces and just FYI it is acne Awareness
Month has are people so I worked in a
dermatologist wouldn't believe how acne
affects people's life I mean it's
something normally going on on your face
bag me aren't making happen really
anywhere but you know mostly on the face
and that really affects people
especially with their confidence I've
just seen it bring a lot of people down
so hello acne Awareness Month
anywhere's this is the complete 2-step
acne clarifying system you get the
cleanser the lotion and then you get the
spot treatment with this kit then oh my
god I love my makeup wipes oh these are
supposed to be medicated with the
salicylic acid in it so it's like an
acne clean cleaning cleaning wipe what
so whenever you're cleaning off your
makeup you're like treating for acne
because that's ourselves too like acne
he has that celsa acid in it
the next product I got is the Dr Lin
skincare daily cleanser salicylic acne
treatment and this is the full size
bottle of the wash at the doctor Lin
this is their hydrating gel which is
supposed to be really lightweight on the
skin it won't clog pores it won't
more breakout also supposed to be really
soothing to irritated skin so then from
dr. Lin skincare I got the acne spot
corrector so this one actually has
benzoyl peroxide in it and with a spot
corrector whenever I worked at the
dermatologist the benzoyl peroxide was
probably like the number one thing that
I noticed kill people's acne so they
have a visible peroxide spot corrector
which is pretty cool at the dr. Lin
skincare acne cleansing pads have
salicylic acid in them but they're
alcohol-free I'm hoping they won't be
too drying on the skin because you know
a lot of times a lot of acne clearing
products can be really drying says
alcohol-free so it should be good but

product that I got is this brush bride
chi you guys see me use my little blow
and go the little thing that hooks to
the mirror and holds my blow dryer and I
need it a bristly like a sticky brush
that has holes in it to be able to like
wow it was like blow dry out my hair
like let's see how this works this is a
two inch one and it's the Chi turbo I
think it was only 14 bucks I say I got
I've heard really good and really bad
things about this this is the Stila stay
all day liquid lipstick so I've heard
bad things about that like my under eye
areas really white today I got the rosa
color and it is like light light light
nude pink oh but it looks really pretty
I hope it's not gonna be too light on my
face and make it look like I have like
white on my lips you
I mean but we're gonna see what happens
with it isn't new I don't think I got
the oh it says new it says no bad new
product memorial this is the magic
blooming light infusing a primer I just
want to try it
oh it looks like it's really pearly like
it loose I guess a pearl iridescent over
it looks beautiful guys hello doesn't
smell like anything
it is definitely gonna be one of those
primers that makes you glow honey and
you guys know I'm all about it though I
got the magic Lumi yeah I don't know how
to say this makeup brand for sure like a
lot of people will comment and let me
know I know oh I know this is shade zero
one must be a liquid highlight and I
can't get it out of the box comes in
this really nice glass bottle and this
is like a peachy pink shades with lots
of shimmer in it and I have so many
highlighters that are champagne colored
a light color I wanted to try something
that's a little bit more rosy and not
just like white or champagne the only
thing that sucks about it whenever I was
playing with the tester in the store why
the pump pumps out like a lot it comes
out like a whole lot of product
whenever you probably he would probably
waste some of the product that's the
only thing I think that stinks about it
it is a very thin product and the
highlight that comes out of it is subtle
it's not like a really strong powerful
highlight just something really subtle I
think you could totally mix this in with
your foundation or something like that
if you wanted to experiment have a
little fun and I got something from
Tarte I got oh okay so I got this
concealer from Tarte and deep I never
had a tar concealer before and I just
wanted my gosh look I don't think that's
supposed to happen no that's not
supposed to happen
looks like the plastic stayed on oh well
we're just gonna pop him back in I got
the shade deep because I have an arse
contour stick but it melted in my drawer
that wasn't by the
son or anything like we keep a seagoing
i'ma I don't know it just decided to
want it to melt so it turned to a bunch
of mush so I thought I would try a tart
contour stick with the concealer in
shade deep you don't see what happens
but it's not promising I got two hair
products I got Eve Eva NYC let me tell
you I got like this stuff and many one
and I like Birchbox or it C or something
like that like many moons ago got their
dry shampoo and their texture spray
which this is like to my favorite hair
products behind the world it's a texture
spray and dry shampoo like I buy more of
that than anything and I really wanted
to try these out I've already tried the
dry shampoo and it was amazing but the
smell of these like you would literally
just oh and it smells so good it smells
like a perfume you could wear them as a
perfume not recommend it but you know I
get crazy over here and also give it a
little spritz I'm sure they'll have a
test or somewhere but I haven't tried
the texture spray but dry shampoos bomb
smells really good
and I just got some poor strips from
Biore I don't personally use these that
often they put these on him
you'd probably kill me if he knew I was
telling you guys but this is just a
little deep Pore strips by Beulah ray
then from Tarte I got there I mean one
try this forever so this is their clean
slate timeless smoothing primer I've
heard this stuff is nothing but your
goal so of course I had to try it I'm
kind of intrigued by it being in a
little pot Oh looks a little funky but
oh my gosh it feels so soft and creamy
it feels very silicone base which I like
silicone base primer so I'm probably
gonna like this one up and very soft
very creamy and it smells so good it
smells really light and rosy Omo so I'm
really excited to try this out I feel
like I blew through everything kind of
fire off that is it for this alcohol I
have stuff everywhere right now oh but
