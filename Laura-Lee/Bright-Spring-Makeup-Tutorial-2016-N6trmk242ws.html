the project that I'm working on I cannot
wait for you guys to know more about it

really really soon and I hope you're
excited about it I'm super super super
excited about it I want sneak peek so
you want to know more about that be sure
to follow me on my social because I am
showing you all good good so when I was
in Minnesota me and Sigma filmed a
little this or that video just for fun
this video isn't sponsored by Sigma or
anything like that I was just filming at
their headquarters and so I'm gonna put
that video at the end of this video so
if you want to see me do that this or
that Challenge thing of a bob just stay
tuned to the end of this video or you
can skip down to the end of this video
whatever you want to do and you can just
see me and do this or that okay jump
right in and get started be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
so you don't miss out on my weird sales
let's get started
first I start off with a little bit of
Smashbox photo finish primer water this
just gets musky a little bit of
hydration sometimes I just can feel it
being dry so I'm gonna go in with the
essay edit pore vanishing stick I
thought it was lips it down crazy just
apply this only in
is that my pores decide to behave like
heathens and show themselves and so then
I'll like press it into my skin I've
been using this foundation for a little
bit and I like it so far you're supposed
to shake it up well it's the tart ring
force at the sea I've been mixing light
beige medium and tan sand together one's
a little too dark and one's a little too
light so I just mix them I'm gonna be
using my artist brush in number eight
these brushes are pricey but I really
like them especially for Foundation and
light cream contour and you're not
really supposed to pick them up off your
face you're supposed to like keep it on
your face and smoothly blend it and not
do this number with it just like a heads
up you kind of like rubbing butter all
over your face you can say I'm gonna be
using the LA girl Pro concealer and then
these things always like poof air into
my eye and it scares me favorite brush
to blend out my concealer is the f-86 so
I just had to go poop tap tap tap dip
dip I just blend it out now go ahead and
add a little bit of translucent powder
this one's by Laura Mercier I'm be using
the f77 to do so with that's happening
I'm gonna go in with my morphe 9 C
palette I'm gonna be using a sigma fo5
and we're just gonna define our
cheekbones
I always have added a little bit
underneath here and it just kind of
makes you look you have a little bit
more of a pal and just a smidge on the
jawline just sharpen that up a bit
gonna Sigma s 25 I'm just gonna dust
away the powder I'm gonna be using this
buxom blush it's really pretty it's like
iridescent and this one's in intoxicated
we're using Urban Decay's afterglow
highlighter in San Sam it's an f-35
brush yep
it's good one we can s78 just to contour
the nose I'm a full video on contouring
noses so if you really want to get into
that check that video out it's poppin'
I'm gonna add a little bit of mac fix+
so I'm gonna apply a shadow shield which
is gonna help us tremendously with the
fallout I'm secret on an e25 I'm just
gonna blend this in the crease I'm gonna
be kind of sure not to drag it on down
to the lid because I just want to focus
it mostly in that crease super subtle
brown color so it's a great transition
shade I'm gonna take chess board from
the Urban Decay alice-in-wonderland
palette which is just a little bit of a
deeper color and I'm gonna pop that
right into the crease I normally like to
go with more than one matte shade I find
that it makes it look look them a little
bit more radiant I'm gonna go in with my
Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre and just a
flat f70 brush willing to then apply
this to the lid it may seem like we're
kind of in a cut crease
not really just helps like the glue
become more vibrant on the eye more than
anything so we want the wood to be
poppin let me using this e47 which is
quite a handy brush for a look like this
heads well I'm gonna take heads will
roll from the Urban Decay palette
reminds me that song I'm just applying
that to the first half of my lid with
this little brush which like I said is
super handy brush next I'm taking a
little bit of I'm so fancy from the
violet boss palette and I'm going to
blend that on the outer corner of the
eye and just take it on out and I'm
gonna bring it about halfway in I'm
gonna take Bandersnatch it's just the
deeper blue and just pop that right on
top of those shimmery colors I'm gonna
be using my Sigma black gel liner that I
use in every video I'm gonna do my liner
off-camera but I do have a full liner
dedicated video I will link down below
next I'm gonna apply a little bit of my
Marc Jacobs the UM liner Laura get your
life together Marc Jacobs mascara and
then I'm gonna apply this little false
lash this is my Lily lashes I'm like
pretty sure this one's called goddess
I'll double check that one this pair
like 15 times so honestly at this point
I'm not a hundred percent sure next I'm
going to apply secret which was the
shade from the violin bow palette okay
stupid oh damn I take banner snatch and
just apply that closer to the lash line
we're going to take this tart liner and
just apply it in my waterline I always
open the wrong in its double ended and I
never get it right and I'm going to add
a little bit of mascara to those lower
lashes we can't leave them out for my
lips I'm gonna be using tarts namaste
then I'm gonna put on Geoffrey stars I'm
nude on top of that it's the final look

easy peasy one for me I'm going with

eight eleven they are talking about
eyeliner brushes for me I'm an e 11 girl
I just like this tiny little point to
get that purse sized winged liner the
next one is Express Club or Express
matte most my followers already know I'm
gonna pick the mat all the way
f23 or f77 brush oh this is hard because
I use these in two different ways but if
I had to choose I would choose this guy
right here this is the s 23 and I like
to honestly dust the way my translucent
powder with this it just boots right in
there perfectly this 80 or 3d HD kabuki
brushes I'm going with the best seller
the SAT to blend out that foundation so
now we're gonna have a little bit of fun
and we have some more this or that
questions they're a bit random to catch
me off guard
