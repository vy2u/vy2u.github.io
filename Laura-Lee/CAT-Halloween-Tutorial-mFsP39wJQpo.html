video is going to be a cat video that
was probably in a way this look was
inspired by Lou boo lovey Lou
for my last star-studded September with
uLTA Beauty which is where I get to go
to Ulta beauty and meet the celebrities
I had to meet the one and only Sarah
Jessica Parker and she was there she did
a meet-and-greet and all for her new
perfume stash its sold at Ulta beauty
this is a stash of perfume that she kept
for 10 years and then she released it
out into the world and that's when she
called it stash so cute I have an
interview I did with her on my facebook
it was a facebook live it was just a
short little interview and it was really
cool getting to meet her and for her new
perfume I think that's amazing they also
set that up thank you also beauty I had
so much fun meeting her today's video is
going to be the most basic Halloween
tutorial that you can ever get a black
cat you don't have a Halloween idea you
could always resort to a black cat I'm
pretty sure that like my whole childhood
I was a black cat every year very
original but I thought I would do the
story because hey what if you want to be
a black cat you're not sure how to do
your makeup I can help you out and I
used all makeup products no like fancy
Halloween you know tools and stuff for
this this was just like makeup you know
I'm saying it's probably in your makeup
bag alright I'm going to start out this
tutorial with priming my skin using the
Too Faced hangover RX primary this
Prime's and moisturize and preps the
skin and gets it ready for foundation
next I'm going to add my Revlon
Colorstay foundation in shade 310 I'm
just going to apply that all in my face
as I normally apply my foundation next
I'm going to add some cat ears I forgot
to put those on in the beginning but
what a president like I did I'm gonna
take this pure cameo contour stick and
I'm gonna highlight underneath my eyes
with it to really really really get them
super bright for a cat like a parent I'm
also going to highlight in the other
usual areas I just did the under light
under eye and upper lip super dramatic
because I want it to create cat-like
features
this is so easy to blend out by the way
this product it's like a cream whenever
you put it on but it kind of blends out
like a powder as you can see it just
blends out within a couple swipes it's a
super interesting product and I've been
using it for a few months now and I've
really been enjoying it
next I'm going to take this be on a
style setting powder which I've been
enjoying lately and I'm just going to
take a blender and push this right on
top of all the areas that I've applied
that highlight that way it lasts longer
it doesn't crease and that way I look
super crazy for the rest of this
tutorial
ah alright that smeared
now I'm going to just take this little
brush after I let it set for about um
yep there's the contact yep yep girl get
it ah came out I look so freaky right
now but um I like to dust this away but
I had let the powder set on my face for
like four to five minutes and then I
dusted away pop that contact back into
place and now we are moving on now I'm
going to take the backside of the cameo
contour and shade light and I'm going to
contour my face I do quite a heavy cream
contour on this one because we're trying
to become a cat and I was just trying to
really have defined features on my face
now I'm just going to take some time and
blend all of this contour out again it's
the same product so it blends out very
very easily this one is in the shade
light which is one that I use for pretty
much every day but um I would say I
should have used the one and shade
medium for this tutorial just see a bit
more strong cat-like features so I ended
up going back in and adding some more
bronzer right on top so I'm going to be
using my essence Sun Club bronzer just
to warm this up and define a little bit
more I just did a full video reviewing
kit and message from essence Beauty so
if you want to check that out I'll
definitely have it link it down below
it's such a great affordable makeup
brand and I found a lot of gems and
maybe a couple misses in my past video
but basically I'm just adding this
product right on top of that contour and
then I'm going to go ahead and prime my
eyelids
alright Dunkeld ah here comes the crazy
part the eyebrows they didn't come out
exactly how I wanted them to just be
honest but after the full makeup look
with done I liked them I took the
essence black gel liner and the
since eyeliner brush and I started to
draw on the brows I tried to keep them a
little bit higher up and super arched
and then really furry towards the
towards the front like little hair like
strokes and then I just made them really
bold and black like a black cat
I think what's a whole look came
together the eyebrows look pretty good
but whenever I was ina ma John Juan and
the rest of look wasn't done I like
scared myself I was like what did I do
to this look guys um but I liked it I
honestly like if you're looking at the
computer I liked my right eyebrow better
than the first one that I drawn which
was my left eyebrow but we rolled with
it next I took the sweetheart blush from
Too Faced and I want it to get really
peak dramatic cheek so I started puffing
that right onto my place such a pretty
color blush
oh girl next up is for eyeliner which is
the main attraction I think I just used
this same essence beauty liner and
created a very large winged liner on my
upper eyelid with that same little s.pd
brush I want the liner to be super
dramatic and really defined the cat eyes
and then I actually took it all the way
down around the bottom of the eye I
didn't want to drag it down too low on
the bottom of the eye so really drag
your eye down but I kept it kind of
close to the lash line and then right in
that inner corner of the eye sorry I
didn't film it a little bit closer so
you could really see but in the inner
corner of the eye I create a point light
kind of like kitty cat graphic liner
and then um what I didn't show you on
that I I just added a little bit of a
light brown eyeshadow I actually use the
brown powder out of that Revlon just
face powder it's just a super dark
powder and I just used it kind like an
eyeshadow just to define the eyelid a
little bit you can totally skip this
part because it didn't end up showing up
that much but um you know guys a little
ma I love my eyeshadow so then I went
ahead and just the very tip of the nose
added that black liner on the liner
stayed so well actually wore this look
for a long time and it didn't budge it
didn't smudge didn't cause any issues
whatsoever so that was awesome and so
then I just drag it down and create a
little kitty nose and then I drag
obviously a little center part down and
connect it with the Cupid's bow on the
lip next I start with the upper lip you
can use a black local lipstick or any
black lipstick to do this part but I
just want to have him kept going my
liner and it didn't come off it didn't
bleed on my bottom lip it didn't get in
my mouth it literally was a really good
end result with the liner I took a lot
of time to get this even because at
first I drew my upper lip on supercorps
good that happens sometimes and then I
really over drew it and I feel like
because it was a black you couldn't tell
that I over drew it that much to really
get that cat upper lip and then I just
sharpened it out on the edges kind of
like a winged liner for your lips that's
super weird then I took the pure double
ego liner and I took the liquid pen
liner side and drew streaks for cat
whiskers of course and then I ended up
taking the other side of it and just
doing a little polka dots for like where
the whiskers start to come out your
typical basic AF cat look and that is it
for this cat look I hope you guys
