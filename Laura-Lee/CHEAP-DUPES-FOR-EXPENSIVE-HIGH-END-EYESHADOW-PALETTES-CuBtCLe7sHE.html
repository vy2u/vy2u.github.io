this what this look what you do is done
to me hey guys what's up and welcome to
my channel today's video is going to be
an exciting video because I'm hoping to
save you some money I did a ton of
research and basically pulled all of my
eyeshadow palettes out and then I
started to be together in dupes and I've
actually found way more than I thought I
would I found so many palettes now not
every single palette has every single
color and it like the dupe doesn't have
every single Co the high-end palette but
it has very similar colors and a lot of
the same colors in the palette so this
is a pretty exciting video I'm such a
sucker for eyeshadow palettes I love
them and I can never actually have
enough of them I don't know what it is
about it but lip products and eye
products I can't have enough of I'm
obsessed with so anytime I can save you
guys money I love to do it I've done
quite a few dupes videos on my channel
so this is just another one to add to
the mix also if you haven't already be
sure and join my back-to-school giveaway

video
shall we begin with I think probably I
don't know where to begin
okay let me just begin first of all I
got a lot I got three Urban Decay
palettes we duped in the first one is
the most Hot Topic palette right now
this UPS hello little brush this is the
naked heat it recently came out is very
warm home palette and so no lie it
wasn't that hard to do because there are
so many pounds out there that are warm
tone now and you don't have to spend a
buttload of money to get a warm tone I
look I'm in love with this palette I
think they did a great job creating a
warm tone palette I feel like this
palette should have been created a long
time ago I don't know why I feel that
way I just do and so this one I believe
is 52 if I'm not mistaken and I kind of
found two dupes for it I find that this
NYX palette this is the ultimate palette
in sugar high I love this palette so
much is actually what I have on my eyes
today kind of my obsession it has so
many of the similar colors but wait
there's more the morphe 35o party people
this palette right here has so many
dupes in it it is so similar it's
incredible how many colors I was able to
swatch and share with you so I'm gonna
go ahead and swatch and share with you a
couple of the colors that look similar
and that way you can get a good idea of
why this is such a good do here we have
some comparison sorry they're a little
bit sloppy but of the heat palette by
urban decay and the morphe 35o lots of
similar themed color so you can get out
of the palette as far as the NYX sugar
high palette no the colors are not
identical but they are super similar and
I just think that you could get for such
a lower price you could get such a
similar look out of the palette so again
I think these are two dupes I think the
morphe 35o is even a better dupe but if
you wanted something that you could get
like an Ulta or something the next
palette is an option as well this
palette is definitely husband duped next
up I have a pretty cool dupe for the
Smashbox shapematters eyes palette they
have these little palettes and I think
they're great quality this isn't really
pretty all matte eyeshadow palette and I
found a dupe from makeup revolution and
I've used this palette in a video before
this is they're all matte this is the
ultra professional
shado flawless Matt I found this at Ulta
and it has actually a lot more shade
smaller pans the more shades and so many
of these shades are due to Sun real
honey baby child girl we saving money
today and the makeup revolution ones are
very creamy just as well look at that
that's makeup revolution right there
just a swatch like and it's that creamy
and I find that honestly these are just
as creamy pretty much but the quality is
definitely there with the makeup
revolution so here are some swatches of
each palette and it's really hard to
tell the difference and even with this
blue color right here this is actually
makeup revolution and this one is
Smashbox had a little bit more
pigmentation my hands are a mess but I'm
trying to keep my arm in focus here but
you're gonna see like you can create so
many of the same looks but yet saves so
much money at the same time comment down
below like if you were able to find a
very similar situation of a palette but
the cheaper one forfeited a little bit
of quality would you still buy instead
of the high-end palette are you like it
absolutely has to have the good quality
like how do you feel about that comment
down below your thoughts on quality
versus the price next up I found a dupe
for a brand new palette this one is by
Mac has met its wonted my brain just
freeze hello I'm back this one is by MAC
Cosmetics this is the power-hungry
palette and I think these are really
cute it's like a little bar really
convenient to travel with palettes and
then this one looks like pretty easy to
do because as you can see these colors
are pretty neutral natural nellie
but i found a really cool drugstore dupe
this one is the goldens palettes from
covergirl
these palettes are pretty darn good
quality so let's go ahead and get into
swatches and let me show you my thoughts
there are a few of the swatches actually
both palettes have quite subtle colors
like the Browns are subtle the neutral
white is subtle and even the goldens
aren't that crazy pigmented they're both
very arid essent
but then here we got into this shimmery
Browns of both ends and they look so
close in color especially after you
don't blend it out on the eye so you can
save yourself that some moola between
these two pallets for sure and again no
they're not
cool but I think they're pretty darn
close and worth the money saved this
palette has been literally close with a
piece of hair and that hurt so bad
this palette has been talked about so
incredibly much in the beauty community
this is the modern residence and I gotta
say it's one of my favorite palettes I
love it so much
honestly I killed it with this palette I
wish I knew how many of these things
sold I bet it's a bazillion but anyways
it is a little bit pricey and I think I
found a dupe now this is another one the
ultimate Nix Palace this one is warm
rust and that cannot describe this
palette anymore and I think it's just
such a closed so many close colors in it
and that's great because now you can
save your money i swatched all the way
up my arm I mean you get sparkly
shimmers white shimmers really rusty red
tones shimmery bronzes and then some
matte really warm orangey colors and the
quality I think of both palettes is
great I think that the anastagia one has
just a little bit more pigmentation but
I'm obsessed with these niggas ultimate
palettes you guys know that I've been
talking about them so much on my channel
I just can't stop and so I think that
just the price cut is unreal I believe
those are 19 and then this one is
40-something so the prices almost have
you get two more shades in this palette
because this one is a at 12 shaded
palette but still I still think is worth
the price cut and the pans in the next
one are bigger so it is a thought next
up we have two more dibs and I have
another urban decay going against morphe
dupe I swear to you right when I opened
this palette I was like duh hello and I
get smoky the exact valley there are so
many dupes Isabel it's unreal which is
super exciting because again it's like
half the freakin price and you get way
more shades in the morphe palette so
this is the smoky palette and you know
what like even open any of these
palettes and like looking at them and
made me want to be like Carly you should
use one grays and smoky colors because I
don't use them that much I like to use
ma B purples and a lot of warm tones but
I don't dabble too much in a grey so
maybe a well-know so let's do some
swatch of Rosie's and let me show you
this
similarities here we have it oh my
goodness look at the Browns the blacks
the bluish gray is the shimmery colors
even the gray is more than matte Gray's
and then the Goldy shimmers oh they're
so similar and I think it's just
absolutely nuts I never realized this
before like I'm shooting myself does
that make sense i guy shoot myself in
this video I was like what this has been
sitting beneath me the whole time and
here's even another one combust and then
this color like they're just so similar
guys like what are we doing here this is
unreal so this is actually kind of fun
video to create like show you guys ways
as they money the amount of makeup wipes
I am burning through for this video so I
only have one more dupe for you guys but
I feel like we went through a lot of
good stuff and saved a lot of moolah
next up actually have two dupes for this
palette we have the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette and makeup revolution yeah
makeup revolution with their Redemption
I should have palette iconic number
three oh three and three hello there
dupes there Duke I mean honestly look at
that look at the color scheme and setup
it's so similar it's unreal so let's go
ahead and do some swatches swatches and
get a lookie-lookie alright alright
alright it's pretty incredible at the
similarities the shimmery White's the
purpley blacks and we have a bronzy a
greyish color and then some more Pink's
that are just these are wildly similar
it's crazy and these makeup revolution
palettes are really creamy actually I
don't play enough with that brand on my
channel but playing with them right now
and doing this video I'm like um hello
kind of loving their makeup so this is
exciting and yeah I'm I'm I'm here for
it okay and also I was going to mention
that the Roses palette by covergirl it's
very similar as well I feel like the
Urban Decay has a little bit better
quality than the Roses palette but I
just think that this set up you get so
many of the similar colors however you
get more colors in this another reason I
thought this was the better do because
you get more colors versus more colors
and and that just works out well so that
is this video I hope it was helpful for
you guys what did you guys think of the
dupes that I came up with
and if you have a dupe that you're
holding on to or that you know about you
