channel today's video is going to be an
awesome video because I did my homework
I have come up with so many absolutely
amazing drugstore dupes for popular or
high in highlighters and I'm going to
take you some dolla dolla do the show
other if you didn't know already I am
doing a IG giveaway I'm doing five days
of giveaway so I'm going to be posting a
new massive giveaway for every five day
so be sure you head over to my Instagram
and enter that it's super easy to enter
and all the rules are listed below the
pictures with all the makeup so I don't
really have anything that's the only
announcements that I have for you guys
so without further ado be sure and
subscribe and we'll go ahead and get
started let's jump right in the video
okay Jesus where to begin where to begin
where to begin
okay I guess we'll just start with I
have six different dupes happening here
and I guess we'll just start with the
goal the avid OOP for the Becca
cosmetics moon stone this is a super
pretty highlight it is white with a
little bit of a champagne e pinkish cast
to it so we're going to go ahead and
give her a watch Rosie now the friends
that I have found a dupe for it is the
pixie eggs Aspen love Aspen what's up
girl is what is her santorini sunset
highlighter and the texture is also like
seriously the same here our closest of
the two highlighters are you kidding me
and as you can see the pigmentation as
well it's just duped right over it's
literally just as creamy as the becca so
girl these are in amazing boobs you
should have seen this watching on my
hand when doing the math to these to
mouth whenever figuring all these out it
was literally like had them all to my
arm i will swatch one drugstore one and
like fifty high-end ones and try to find
the dupe there so that's kind of how i
did it
and yeah these two were just like a
thing being
a little match and so yeah there's
definitely a do hello
next up is a really awesome dupe that I
discovered and I love these two
highlighters and I obviously love them
because of the pretty much the same
color this is the ad or air nude 0:01
now the packaging is in the dupe you
definitely get the luxury packaging with
the mirror in it oh such a pretty
highlighter but then it's like these are
it almost like opal by Becca
they have like they're a light
highlighter with a little bit of a pink
hue to them super beautiful and yeah
they're very shimmery very pigmented
both of them and they're both very
lightweight so I'm going to show you
guys so this one right here is Dior and
then this one right here is wet and wild
pretty much going to get the same
situation happening on your cheekbone
whenever you use these and again the
pigmentation is just so similar and
beautiful and this is a major price
difference by the way okay a pretty cool
dude did I figured out and I really
didn't see myself planning a dupe for is
this makeup geek psychedelic highlighter
and the reason I say that is because
it's such a unique shade in the pan it
doesn't look unique at all whenever you
swatch it you can see it is era doesn't
okay guys so this is the makeup geek one
and then this one is the NYX this is the
NYX do a chromatic highlighter this one
is in shade snow rose so the only
difference I really see here is snow
rose is a little bit brighter and
lighter whereas the makeup geek is a
little bit of a deeper and has a little
bit more pink to it but reality is
they're both aridif and they're so
incredibly similar I don't know why I
just showed you swatch this before
showing you this I just got really ahead
of myself I guess okay I really like sad
end stuff but this is such a cool
highlighter and of all three of these
they have like a little line of these in
there so cool and I love them so much so
for our next tube is it was really hard
to kind of do for this this is Mac so
darling and oh this is just a gold
highlighter it has like a very specific
gold color to it I did find my
broken I design somewhat of a dupe for
it and the dupe is not exact and I'll
tell you why now the color of the dupe
is exact this is a mega go gold bar
highlighter from one well this one is
kind of hard to get their hands on I'll
try to find it and link it down below
but this one just isn't as pigmented as
the Mac one is just being honest so it
comes up a little bit with lighter
pigmentation but the actual color that
you get is the exact that's just bad the
exact same is oh darling my Mac so let
me show you so the color when the light
hits the DTO is like the exact same but
this is oh darling and then this is one
Wow so it's not quite as pigmented okay
I have a dues for my girls out there who
don't love a blinding highlight and are
more on the subtle end of things I found
a dupe for the cover X this is sunlight
now I personally don't wear these
highlights often because I just prefer a
more blinding highlight doesn't mean
they're not pretty and doesn't mean they
don't work well but they're more powdery
to me
here's sunlight as you can see it just
comes off a little more powdery than it
does blinding which is okay it's just
not my obsession but for those of you
who do like it this is the SSP renewed
highlighter and this is B my highlight
number 10 and it is an exact tube now I
like this product and I think it's
pretty but again it just is so similar
like they are incredibly similar do you
see okay this one right here is the
essence and then this discover effects
they have the exact same Sheen and
moment going on there with the sole
illness so if you're looking for a
subtle highlight either of these would
work but you can totally save your money
with the essence he nodded alright it
was cool do I sound roof you guys
remember when I test out the one dollar
makeup I found this highlight and it was
genius this little compact came together
was nice and the highlights only one
dollar and it's so creamy all my
incredible and again you guys actually
it was in stock until my video went live
then it was sold out so hopefully that's
been like over a month ago hopefully
they're back in stock I will check for
you guys but it is a total do for the
Starlight illuminate
up by on a pusher Beverly Hills let me
show ya
I did a heavy swatch on this one because
I got excited now this is the one dollar
highlight and then this is starlight
from Anasazi Beverly Hills I personally
think that these both will look great on
someone with a lighter complexion or if
you want really light handed a deeper
complexion
they're super blinding and beautiful but
they are so incredibly similar it's nuts
okay last and certainly not least I
found a dupe for both of these these are
almost identical highlights as they are
this is pearl and I shoe baby by dosa
colors now here is pearl by Becca it's
just so snow-white I personally cannot
wear these highlights and I can maybe
use them on my brow bone or as an eye
shadow but they're difficult for me to
work in and get to use them on a regular
basis this is pearl by Becca
this is icy baby by dose and this is the
pixie glowy powder London luster by
pixie ex Aspen and to me they all blow
three would be exact same they're all
three going to come off the same on your
cheekbone and the one by Aspen is just
the most affordable dupe that we have
here so this is actually I do for two
highlighters and this is London luster
and it is fabulous super creamy formula
and I definitely recommend it to you
guys and that is my last dupe so I hope
this video was fun and helpful to you
guys and hopefully I'll save you some
money honey and I love you guys thank
you so much for being here and watching
I hope to see you in the next video be
sure and head over to my Instagram to
