lot of information honey did you catch
all about that further ado we're gonna
sing the SUBSCRIBE song and then we're
jump right into do's and don'ts of
contouring and highlighting all right
now let's jump right into the video
girl that is too close they see too much
you make people nauseous honey I've seen
things wrong with my face that I didn't
even know that's too far let's take it
on back take it on back take it on back
alright so let's just jump right in I'm
gonna be using for the cream contour and
highlight for this video these little la
girl concealer because I do like to
conceal and cream contour a lot majority
of the time I don't cream contour I
always can still so I'm gonna start off
with this in the shade natural so I do
when highlighting your face you want to
go about two shades lighter than your
foundation I don't you don't want to go
like five shades lighter than your
foundation where it's like stark white
or it's just too intense and you also
don't want to apply too much product
when it comes to highlighting because
then it can get Creasy that's another
don't so it do is you can add a little
bit of product and then you can go in
and add more later to build it up it
looks like I have a lot on but really I
have on a thinner layer of the concealer
whenever you are highlighting areas you
are bringing them out whenever you were
contouring areas you are sucking them on
in
so areas that you want to look lush and
awake and beautiful you highlight such
as the center of the forehead under I
look really bright healthy awake like
you got eight hours of sleep when we all
know we all got five hours of sleep and
girl we are sleepy do the cupid scope
bow give you a little bit more of a
plump lip the center of the nose the
chin I like to do to round out my chin
do right here so these are really the
areas you want to highlight now will
I'll show you the areas you do want to
contour and some do's and don'ts on
where you're applying your contour it
turns out my stick for contours dried
out so I'm just gonna have to use this
little k'kaw stick I'm using the stick
in medium and I'm gonna use the darker
side so I go about right here and I
don't like to take it a dump is don't
take it all the way here you don't want
to bring it down too far either cause
it'll give you a 5 o'clock shadow you
want to keep it right in the center and
keep it short and sweet and you can kind
of go around about the tempo in the
forehead as well so if you have a larger
forehead you can really contour around
the area as perimeters of your forehead
and it can make your forehead look
smaller it's like face surgery with
makeup it's so cool so I'm gonna do the
nose eye to round out my nose blend out
my concealer I typically just use my
wife's sakes you guys know that and you
want to stipple it out this is a do you
definitely want to tap tap-tap tap-tap
softly stipple it out adult is you don't
want to pull and drag and get brush
streaks in your product really I like to
stipple it out and then I can kind of
buffer back and forth but really want to
be gentle on that under-eye come on
getting concealer in her eyeliner I like
to tap it out you'll really get a pretty
airbrush finish like this
I also use my m5 at 3-6 brush that I
made especially with morphe to blend it
out it does fit a little bit better on
the under eye area and you can blend out
the nose forehead everywhere with it and
the great thing about this brush is you
can also use it to blend out contour use
it blend out cream contour this brush is
especially great for cream products you
can just take it and buffer that little
contour out a really beautiful finish
so adieu when blending out you just want
to take your time and buffer em because
you don't want any harsh line so you
don't is you don't want to see where the
highlight and contour connects you just
want it to seamlessly blend together
which really using a kabuki brush
or any type of blender that you love
like a Beauty Blender of any sort that
you're currently loving works out great
for this really the key with contouring
is taking your time and blending and you
don't want to shift the product too much
that's adult you don't want to like be
jerking the product around because you
strategically placed it on your face in
particular areas so you want to keep it
in those areas and even my nose I'll do
my finger so I don't move around the
contour too much because I know know
where one that contour to stay okay
anytime you place a cream on your face
and don't would be just been like girl
okay we look good we are done because
reality is this is only gonna look good
for like an hour and it's gonna be
creasing and sloughing off you've just
set it with a powder so this is where
I'm gonna show you how I contour with
these palettes so we'll take my white 11
brush get it in some loose setting
powder this one is my Laura Mercier and
I'll just go ahead and set all the areas
that I highlighted with the loose powder
not the areas that I contoured you could
even just a light layer over the areas
like I'm doing on my forehead and be
done with it or you can put a lot on
like I pull my under eye and bake and
let it sit there for two to three
minutes and then dust away the excess
which really helps the makeup to last a
long time it's really up to you and your
skin type I will tell you if you have
dry skin type you might not want to bake
if you have more of an oily skin type
baking might really help you prolong
your makeup this is the low five palette
it is super gorgeous this is the one
that I use for my skin tone it is a
little bit lighter there is a rich enemy
is a more richer brown color whenever
you swatch it on your brush it's not
quite as warm as it looks in the pan
and then you have literati donut
debutante debutante I believe this I
pronounce it lit starburst supernova and
cosmic highlighter so the highlight is
really beautiful as well as the contour
you get a nice big mirror
in the palette and then you have HiFi it
has a little bit of deeper colors to it
really beautiful contour shades but
they're a little bit deeper I could get
away when using Dona and debutante and
debutante a I know I'm saying that wrong
and then also the highlighter really
beautiful Palace I might use the
highlighters out of these and the
contours out of those just so you guys
can see the difference and get the use
out of both palettes but really I could
do a full face with this now as most of
you guys know I like to use my art 14
brush these brushes do come my Laura Lee
favorites collection and what I like to
do is tap into donuts and then I'll
literally
contour the powder right on top of where
I put the cream contour this gives you
more of an intense contour looks great
on pictures but if you're just everyday
life living and you just want a contour
every day before work before school or
whatever you got going a date you can do
literally just use this powder contour
so easy you can apply it just how
implying it here wherever I blended out
the cream contour I will just buff and
round circular motions this product on
my face you don't want to go in a color
that is too deep for your skin tone you
do want to use a shade one to two shades
darker than your foundation shade and
that's a great way to find the perfect
contour shade honey so that's what I
like a rule of thumb that I like to go
by so that way the shade isn't too harsh
and I don't is you don't want to go too
intense with your contour again you just
want to add a little bit and then slowly
build it up that's the best way to do so
you do slowly build up your contour but
don't go in with too much of a heavy
hand because you can always add more but
it's a little bit more difficult to take
away also you can slender your jaw way
that contour I'm just gonna do a powder
contour today I always contour my jaw so
I'm tapping in a doughnut still and I
like to buff it along the edge of the
jaw right here an adult you don't want
to bring it up anywhere near here
because you can really end up with like
a 5 o'clock shadow and
good for nobody says dona is such a
lighter shade I like to tap into this
with my why I love it and I do is
because this is a little bit lower than
I want it right here you can chisel out
really clean up that contour and get
more of a precise look rhino's I'm just
gonna tap right back into donut and take
a whi 30:19 Y 19 oh why 19 brush now I'm
gonna apply this to my nose to contour
my nose
now remember anywhere we put the cream
contour you do want to go ahead and put
a powder on top of it and you don't want
to just leave it in there girl cuz it's
gonna slip around so I'll just add it
right on top it's really a beautiful
color and take this little brush and you
can this is a dude you can go back and
forth with the donut or whatever contour
shade you're using and just blend and it
can really give you a more rounded chin
and a more plump bottom lip look so
that's just a little contour trick face
is now contoured I feel like it looks
like it has so much more dimension to it
than when we start it whenever I just
have foundation on like it looks wildly
different now here comes the fun part is
highlighting like my favorite thing I
don't know why you guys whenever I put a
little bit of highlight on the tip into
my nose I'm just like so my favorite
highlight brush is the r36 brush I do is
take a little just the more yellowy
highlight and I'm gonna use that on one
side of my face so you guys can see and
then I'll get some out of the highlight
palette as well here we go
I mean that is really beautiful
highlighting you want to just add it to
the high points of the cheeks that's a
do and it don't age you don't want to
pull it too forward with the pores are
because that is a girl with the texture
is you will enhance your pores you want
to keep this area on points of the
cheeks where you just want the natural
glow and you want to take your time
blending it in so it looks seamless it
kind of looks like it's melted into my
face and I also like to pop a little bit
on my temple just to look like my face
is a glazed doughnut
I'm gonna tap into all these colors into
beam right here for the other cheek just
because I want you guys to see the
difference and use a little bit of this
palette - oh here goes beam I mean
that's just stunning and then I'll bring
it around the temples and now I'm gonna
take a little bit of beam on the tip of
my finger and I'm just gonna apply it to
the tip of the nose and then I'll run it
up the nose and this will give the nose
like a really perfectly straight
appearance I'll also add with my finger
it to my Cupid's bow which plumps hey
girl
my cats talking to me this also can
plump the upper lip a little bit it can
also give you a milk mustache if you add
too much so don't add too much to the
upper yeah okay so this is the final
look on contouring and highlighting and
if you don't want a cream contour it's
all the steps that I use the powder
contour and I hope this helps you out in
