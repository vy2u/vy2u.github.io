video is going to be contouring do's and
Don I decided to do this video because
it might I shadow juice and also ask you
guys which do's and don'ts videos you
want it to see next and by vast majority
votes contouring do's and dont's was
next up on the list so today we are
creating this video thank you for
requesting it and I hope you enjoy my
agenda today is to make us all
contouring pros because contouring and
highlighting can be tricky very tricky
as I disclaim in all my dues notes
videos there are no rules in makeup so
if I tell you something is a don't thing
you love doing well girl friend our
boyfriend
keep doing it you know there's no rules
it's free game free game whatever you
want to do be sure to subscribe before
you leave this video and let's jump in
and get started so in this video we're
going to start off with a contouring do
and this is a simple one but it skipped
often even by myself and it's to hydrate
your skin I'm just gonna be using this
tooth paste coconut primer but it's also
a great hydrant because anytime you add
a cream or powder product to your face
it will adhere or stick to those dry
spots no next up is a contouring zones
and that is don't go too dark with your
contour shade you really want to stick
with one maybe two shades darker than
your foundation shade as you can see
here we've gone above five shades darker
which is no no and it looks a little cry
cry and this is a bit lunch tone for me
as well so you want I like personally to
stick with more cool tones it looks more
natural
so contouring do is to stick to a cool
tone what I personally think
looks flattering on majority of skin
tones is that cool tone bronzer that's
Mac with no shimmer to contour in so
stick with those it'll be all good a
contouring adult here is the brush size
so you want to get a dense brush but
it's not too big and not too tiny this
brush is ginormous and we're really just
putting product everywhere instead of
strategically contouring your face next
up is a contour do and is picking the
right size brush so the fo5 by Sigma is
just perfect it's called a small contour
and it couldn't be more perfect for
powder contouring your face
I love it and it does wonders next up is
a contour adult that is don't move your
product around too low it can give you
the appearance of a five o'clock shadow
which is not what we're going for so
what you want to do is actually when
contouring that cheekbone area you want
to kind of lift the product up but not
too high point being you're putting
products in a strategic area and you
don't want to move it too far from that
area next is a contouring don't and you
want to contour natural areas such as
where the Sun would hit or shadowing is
natural such as under the cheekbone the
temple down the sides of the nose even
the jawline but you don't want to bring
it up in places that aren't super
unnatural because then you're not even
contouring at that point echo oh my gosh
I had a sneeze and next is a contouring
do and is for setting your cream contour
unfortunately when you use cream
products if you don't set them they tend
to slip and slide around on your face
throughout the day but setting them
makes them last longer and to stay in
place and we don't want our contour to
run away on us now do we so that's it
for this video thank you so much for
