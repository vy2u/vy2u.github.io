find out about Crayola makeup hey guys
I sell food in my teeth hey guys what's
up welcome to my channel today this
video is going to be testing out this
Crayola makeup I literally got thousands
of people requesting me to try this out
on my channel so I'm probably getting to
it so I bought a bunch of the Crayola
makeup which is available exclusively at
a so so much a so calm I ordered the
makeup for you little pricey I don't
know why I guess because crayons in the
box were like a couple bucks I just
assumed the makeup would be that way
which is not the normal way of things
what it was my process of thinking there
I don't know also I ordered the two day
shipping on ASOS and girly one two days
shaping okay so that's why this video is
just not going up now also you're gonna
be experiencing the fabulous foundation
concealer free Laura Lee today because I
developed a rash on my face after I
tested the eBay makeup and the camera
lights are kind of bright so they blur
it a little bit and I don't know if you
guys can see the texture on my skin this
one is the worst area on my cheek right
here and it's just a big patch on my
chin my forehead is the only thing that
didn't get any rash at all but girl this
face is I'm not putting on any makeup on
it I will try out the highlight palette
which looks like this also I just wanted
to come on here and tell you guys do not
my fake makeup off eBay do not buy a
fake makeup off said to y'all a do you
not buy fig makeup off wish if the
makeups fake don't use it I've said this
several times my channel but I'm just
reiterating it because look at my face
is covered in around the things I did
for you to use my voice and sake don't
make it don't make it but don't buy it
want a portable makeup check out the
Dollar Tree check out drugstores
clearance bins but don't bother
because I was a saw one thing with a
found kukukaka and fake makeup like
doodoo little doodoo in fake makeup go
what the hell how does that even happen
anyways that's why I'm not gonna be
wearing foundation today and tomorrow I
go out of town and I can't wait to meet
drew Barrymore with a rash all over my
thanks I just wanted to like bring that
to your attention while I'm filming in
this video and now that the intro is 30
minutes long we can get into the video
that will be about 10 minutes long
lasting so let's think the subscribe box
and then we'll jump right into the video
yeah now let's jump right into this
video I haven't watched anyone elses
review on this because I don't want my
review to reflect on things that they've
said about the makeup
however from looking at something else
it doesn't seem too positive but I'm
gonna try to keep a positive outlook on
this makeup so what I got is this
eyeshadow palette this is what it looks
like it's got like kind of looks weird
and this is I kind of wish the packaging
wasn't why I wish it was like yellow
like the crayon box got this like lip
palette and it can't customisable this
palette so you can just mix up your lip
product and get whatever color you want
about the face palette the highlighters
and blushes then I got all these trios
which are for your eyes lips and cheek
and then I got a highlighter stick what
I got oh stuff so oh girl don't itch
assumes you guys in you still can't see
my rash I mean can see you see the
little dots all over my face I so want
you guys to experience it with me so I'm
not alone how this cheddar-cheese
background will be super appropriate for
today but it's like very bright like let
me turn this light down girl okay first
I think I'm gonna put on some eyebrows
and then we'll jump into the eye
problems problem I'm gonna get with it
just give me a second eyebrows have been
planted on my face so now let's have a
look at this OOP that's the wrong
see all these pals look the same and I
wish I don't know there was something
different and long this is the mermaid
eyeshadow palette now if any other brand
came out with this honestly I would be
like I'm not wild by the colors like and
also Crayola I wish it was like cooler
colors but this is like a special makeup
so I am testing it out but if like tar
urban decay came out this I would be
like girl what the hell is this I would
expect more basically but this is
Crayolas first run with makeup and I
think there are really light pastels and
I just don't think of pastels when I
think of Crayola but I haven't checked
the quality so I might actually adore
these eyeshadows I'm gonna go ahead and
put down a little bit of sock sock soft
ochre from that as I want to give this a
fair shot so prime my eyelids really
nicely like I would with any other
eyeshadow but rubbing into the colors
cuz I just watched one of them a lot of
pigment comes off the second blue color
seems really powdery and dry but this
one's super creamy so let's keep digging
in the Greens a little bit dry feeling
it seems like all these big guys in the
middle have a little bit more pigment to
them here are some swatches of the
colors as you can see they're really
glittery and pastel to go in with the
r39 brush I think I'm just gonna try out
like there's no transition shade this is
gonna be a weird look but I'm gonna try
out this guy right here
it feels look at that that's pretty
creamy so that's good so I'm just gonna
pop her in the crease even though it's a
shimmer and this one seems to be working
pretty good I mean I don't really have
any issues with it and not getting
fallout I'm not getting it flinging
everywhere so far so good
we put a little bit on this I kind of
gonna add some of this purple color so
I'm just gonna take the same brush it
looks like a lot comes off this one
looks way dustier though because we have
a lot of color flinging around um you
definitely don't get it's like a light
wash of color you really don't get like
look how deep this purple is and then
when you put it on like girl where's it
at girl was from the vibe that I'm
getting from this palette it's just like
they're kind of hit and miss not
everything is
me and nice and then some of the colors
are really dry and then some are
actually kind of nice do I think it's
worth how much it costs go get nine
shades in the palette let's see how much
it costs cuz I can't remember I showed
up house for 29 bucks for nine shades
and then these little trio kits are
twenty nine for three colors and then
the lip palette is 35 so those are the
prices thirty almost thirty bucks with
shipping and all four nine colors that's
kind of pricey I'm gonna add I just want
to play a little bit of this pinky Mabi
color to my eyelid it just seems like
glittery chunks especially with this
color specifically not really living for
it honestly would I reach for this
palette again probably not but I think
they're awful not all of them I think
some are kind of good in the palette but
some are definitely misses and you don't
get that many colors for twenty nine and
so that's just the information I'm
putting out for you guys you can decide
for yourself
so these save face crayon on them but on
the back of the box it says a collection
of three face crayons for your eyes your
lips and your cheeks highly pigmented
color an ultra creamy and ultra soft
texture I really like that they look
like crayons I think it's a cute super
cute theme this color is calling my
name's bright teal color called
turquoise blue kind I just want to rub
some on my eye and see what's gonna
happen so far a lot of color is coming
off like a lot of color and it came off
really easily so let's go ahead and
color the eyeball and it's coming off on
top of the eyeshadow like no problem
like a like a like a champ honey
and now I'm gonna dab it out it
definitely feel sticky and creamy as I
dab it out which it does say it's creamy
on the packaging oh it's a little bit
messy it's like really really really
creamy like kooky I like how pigmented
it is and I like that you really don't
have to fight the crayon or dig it on
your eye to get a lot of color off you
can literally barely touch your eye and
you get a lot of pigment the only thing
I'm really not loving here is it's
almost sticky it's so creamy and this I
feel like would definitely get really
crazy up in here because of how wet
feeling it is and it's a little
uncomfortable the way it's so sticky I
don't know that I would wear these
because of that at this point I think we
should try to add a little more
eyeshadow on top to eliminate some of
the stickiness oh wow that's sick Sun
good so maybe they work best it's like
an eyeshadow base that's what I'm
finding these are definitely eyeshadow
bases
30 bucks for three eyeshadow bases I
really want to try out this yellow color
and let's see the yellow is not quite as
bright as the blue it's definitely more
muted and it has that same really wet
creamy sticky texture to it
beware the only time I could see myself
using these again as an eyeshadow base
but I pray for a fact I just wouldn't
wear them alone because I feel like it's
a mess waiting to happen on my eyelids
and I already have a mess whenever you
blink it almost tugs your eyelid because
of how tacky it is so just a forewarning
there got this lip and cheek pencil and
I'm gonna try it out this one is called
Mango Tango
oh my god it kind of smells good Wow
Mango Tango has got glitter in it
actually which I was not expecting it's
a really sparkly and shimmery and it
feels really comfortable on the lips so
so far I do like that for the lips let
me try out another one this is
strawberry
oh god bent it just a heads up I thought
these were gonna be like bright and
matte but actually they're really
shimmery and I look like I've never put
on lipstick before I've never looked
crazier in my life actually I probably
have ok now let's have some fun and test
out I like palette yeah go ahead and
swatch a few of these still the exact
same as the eyeshadows a couple feel
kind of dry and a couple of them feel
really creamy but again I feel like it's
a little bit of a hit and miss
these are light light to go in with our
golden shade right here can you see this
do you see how much like flakiness comes
off goes everywhere so I don't really
love how dry they are I'm actually just
gonna put it on like right here since I
have a rash I don't feel like you're
getting too much shimmer oh you got like
a little bit of shimmer but it's more
dry and dusty than anything I'm telling
you guys I just like the feeling of
these it's just like powder you know a
little bit of highlight you better shut
like it's like not that the eye shadow
fill out the whole entire like pan of
the product fell out oh no
that I showed just fell out it look it's
like hard like a pan there's actually no
pan which is weird there is they're just
pressed right into the palate okay great
there are some swatches of the blush
shades which are the three shades at the
end I'm gonna add just a few to my cheek
because my skin really wants me to do
that oh you get a lot off on the brush I
don't mind the blush though at all I
don't mind it it's it's it's pigment I
look like a clown right now it's hard to
take myself seriously looking at myself
I can't imagine what you guys are
thinking right now no I'm just trying to
test it all out for you guys instead of
I don't know like make it a makeup
tutorial like I'm trying to do more of a
first impressions where I can kind of
try a little bit of all of it to give
you guys a run down so that's kind of
how it turning off this crazy blush it
does have like enough pigment but not
overly pigment to it which I do like
that now I really want to swatch this
shimmering blush but what I think they
mean by that is highlighter so this is
looks like an iridescent highlighter
pencil my face is like over my
right now
so you just oh that's pretty
actually this is really pretty like I
like this this is a bad spot to put it
but let me just show you guys this is
like gives you like this little air to
think alone nothing crazy can you see
that like a very faint but like this
iridescent Spacey glow you can
especially see it a little better on my
nose is it super crazy pigment - no but
you definitely get like this little
glimmer and I think it's kind of cute
the blush palette I honestly since I
would only use the blushes and none of
these like I don't think it's worth the
money okay my shadows I think are great
for a base now 3 for 29 for just 3
bright color bases that's just up to you
and what you want your collection the
eyeshadow palette actually it's kind of
hit and miss um they are a little bit
dry and dusty I will warn you a lot of
the colors there are a few colors
they're super creamy in it so 29 bucks
nine colors hit-and-miss
I don't know that I'm really recommended
to you guys but I put the information
out there and it's up to you guys now
last but certainly not least we have
this palette it is the lip palette
basically you can just mix these colors
together and customize your own you're
homeless okay when a didn't took on my
lipstick because we're gonna make our
lipstick today it does come with a
little card palette so you can mix
together on I am going to take a lot of
blue which I know it looks like a little
bit but it's actually a lot whenever
you're mixing for one person a lot of
yellow and just a tiny scratch of red so
red yellow blue here is my card with the
three colors on it and I'm just gonna
take it and I'm gonna mix them all
together and then I'll add some white so
we've gotten this pretty maroon mauve
color I'm gonna add a little bit of
white in it right here really like the
color we've come up with right here it's
like a Mabi purple umm it's got like a
deep undertone which that's our blue
coming through so let's go ahead and
apply it to the lips
and it kind of turned out like this
lavender recolor but they were very
pigmented they mixed together really
well and it was a really full coverage
on my lips and it's very glossy looking
and comfortable to wear but overall I do
like this palette for a lip palette I
think it's pretty cool so this is a win
in my book if you like to get into that
sort of artistry and mix your colors and
I didn't get to swatch this trio so I
just went ahead and swatched it for you
but these look really pretty and I think
could be a really cool eye base actually
this one is lip and cheek so this one's
for your face these are for your eyes
this is a really pretty lip color but
here they are alright that is it for
this video I think a lot of the products
are misses I think a few of the products
are hits it's a little bit in between
let me know sound off in the comments
section what do you guys think about
this collection
surely you watch the whole video tell me
what you think do you spend your money
on it are you headed to ASOS to buy some
of these pieces I think it's really cool
that Crayola did this I look so crazy it
hurts me to look at myself I think you
definitely have to finagle around with
some of the makeup cuz it's like and it
looks like the removal is super easy
just to let you guys know if you're
randomly wondering is that gonna be
staining or stuck to her eye forever it
didn't stain and it didn't stick to my
eye so I do like that about the cream
product do I think that these are gonna
be the easiest products in the world to
work with absolutely not I think like I
said they're definitely gonna take some
finagling guys probably wants to me use
these products too much more in my other
tutorials other than the eye bases if I
was doing some really funky eye look I'm
gonna go get some cortisone cream and
I'm gonna go edit this video and I love
you guys so much be sure to subscribe to
my channel before you leave enjoy the
larlie family today honey today
I think I've misspelled my name yes I'm
wearing a crop top hoodie with a t-shirt
underneath and a lot is going on here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
