today's video is going to be on crayon
eyeshadow so I have this eyeshadow
palette that is like box of crayons it's
from the crayon k/d crayon case calm why
don't you guys tweeted me and showed me
this makeup so I bought it and now I'm
gonna review it it's a very colorful
I should have palette and I can't wait
to show it to you guys once we get into
the video also I bought a couple of
different things from their website just
might as well make a fun video out of it
because they had this like watchful eye
glue stick
I showed a primer like how cool to go
with it so I figured I'd use that with
it and then they also had rosy glow red
glow Rah's highlighting powder so I
thought I would test that as well as the
crayon case lip problems we're gonna do
a review of their products that looks
really cool and I'm really excited to be
trying them out because this is weird
and it might be a gimmick we're gonna be
testing these out I'm gonna do a look
with them that's why I already have my
base makeup on as well as my brows so
I'm excited I hope you're excited we're
gonna do did a cat just come out the
closet we have cats everywhere so we're
gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE song and then
we'll jump right into the video be sure
to one like this before you clap ready
yeah
Tai helps me out with that one and now
we'll go ahead and jump right into okay
guys we are viewing this palette
together like I just peeked at it right
now and I'm like so the colors in it are
extremely big and colorful they're huge
humongous pans really intense crazy
colorful colors I'm already peeking this
transition Shea Shea is saying thank God
they have a transition shade some
palettes do not and that's okay
not all pounds have two but it says
there's so many colors in this one it's
nice that there is one um so I'm gonna
do a colorful look today but I'm like
girl if I look a little cars are so I
say we start with the eyeshadow primer
which is looks like Elmer's glue here is
the packaging of it washable I glue
stick I shadow primer all right whoa I'm
so confused
it said dry oh goes on white and dries
clear kind of like glue okay let's see
what happens it's really um sticky
filling so that kind of makes me a
little nervous because it makes me think
that maybe that I shouldn't won't blend
as well with like a really tacky primer
down um but it might be a great product
to carve out the eyelid to do a cut
crease or something like that okay let's
see what happens because it dries clear
I think it went on like like a cream
color a lot comes out so if you do get
it be careful with it and it is very
tacky so I probably will set it with
some powder so we don't have any
clumpiness in our eye shadow I am gonna
add a little bit of powder on top
because it still feels a bit sticky
sticky wiki and we can't have it exact
oh how much drop my brush I'm gonna take
it in five seven three blender and I'm
gonna go into tan which is our tan shade
which I look at that I love how like a
crayon box they literally just named the
color
what they are would you guys slap me and
through the screen if I literally just
put the tan and gold color on my eyelid
it was like okay neutral look with this
ballot you guys wouldn't beat me with it
I'm not gonna do a neutral look don't
worry it but so far holy goodness
come on pigment good stuff so far but I
mean I did tap in a one color only but
still that's pigmented so just a
confession
whenever I bought that glue primer I
immediately because the bottle so big I
thought that was a facial primer and I
almost put it all over my face um but I
read and I was like else that would have
been terrible feel like we have
transitioned enough and now we can move
on oh my god no what look I want to do I
think I have a look I want to do I hope
it turns out the way I have it my head
my looks mostly don't always do that but
we'll try we'll try real time so first
I'm gonna take yellow right there I'm
not gonna lie like just this big-ass
pile with this big mirror in it like I
love it I love it I love it it feels so
like luxe and cool
I feel really cool using it so I'm gonna
take yellow and go from the inner to
outer corner really blending it and
taking this color up a little bit higher
because after all this is our lighter
color I'm using the exact same blender
that I put the transition shade and down
with I technically could have used the
yellow as my transition shade for the
look I'm gonna attempt to go for today
so the yellow color seems to be very
pigmented and pretty
I'm going to take pink on an hour 39
brush and we're gonna keep this color a
little bit lower
oh come on pink all my brushes are dirty
so I'm like scrounging for a cleaning
brush I can't believe I just found this
clean r39 which makes me so happy and
I'm probably gonna film another video
after this one so I'm kind of like I
need more clean brushes you can tell
this pink color it's like really
pigmented and it makes me very excited
about life and colors the pans are huge
on this palette is this palette will
literally last you like the longest I
think this powder we could be really
cool for a makeup artist
as far as the quality seems to be really
nice and they seem to be blending out
like so good I'm gonna take a little bit
of the orange technically the launch of
the shimmer which I typically wouldn't
put my crease but I'm going to today so
I want to try on a bunch of these colors
and see how they blend
I'm just gonna take a touch of red just
to see honestly if you wanted to
recreate the look you definitely don't
have to use like as many colors I'm
going in with I'm really just trying
this palette out for you guys I'm
wanting to see how each color war next
I'm going to tap into violet so this is
an m4 2-1 and I love this brush to pack
on color
so next I'm gonna go back in with an R
at 39 brush and I just kind of go back
and forth really softly and soften up
that edge with the purple and the pinks
and Red's meet now I'm gonna take this
cloth and just clean up that edge
I'm gonna take my morphe black gel liner
and a morphe liner brush and when in
doubt I'm gonna wake it out and then
I'll finish this I off camera I think
that I should have looks kind of cool
definitely something different I'm gonna
do some more color on the lower lash
line but let me add a little bit of
mascara and a lash and I'll be right
back
I'm gonna go in with right there yellow
and the same brush and I'm gonna go
ahead and blend that yellow shade on the
lower lash line to get pretty awesome I
really like these colorful colors
because they have so much pigment but
not too crazy a pigment and make it
pretty easy to work with I struggle with
colorful color sometimes whenever it's
just way too over pigmented like
subculture was or they don't have enough
pigment and it's just really chalky and
hard to blend out
neutral colors you can normally like
make work but colorful colors like they
just gotta be right and these in this
palette so far have been good to me so I
appreciate that next I'm gonna grab a
little bit of pink on the e36 I'm gonna
grab blue and I'm gonna keep that really
tight with the blue color so dark and
then what I did on the other eyes I
ended up mixing purple in with the blue
so now I'm gonna grab the purple that's
on our eyelid right now I'm just kind of
mix it in there is eyeshadow in my
eyeball oh and give it one more pop I
use this Urban Decay vivid liner it's
very blue and very pretty and lastly for
the eyes I'm gonna pop on a little bit
of mascara to these lower lashes hunter
next up I'm going to test out this
highlighter now the shade of the
highlighter eye pops them out in the lid
on a tube
really pretty and blinding really pretty
implying it just seems kind of pinky but
it has like this gold undertone to it
okay let's see what it looks like oh I
mean it's kind of pinky but oh my
goodness I love it
whoa that is pretty and that's with no
Mac fix plus spray just dry on the cheek
good low shucks
girl this how I hate okay girl yes yes
yes this is just thumbs up I want to
know why my eyeball is trying to water
right now I'm gonna snag some white and
I'm gonna pop it in the inner corner my
darlings okay last thing we have to test
out is the liquid lipstick I'm looking
for it here it is this one is called
what did we this is called we did oh my
god I didn't realize I bought this color
till I open the box but let's try it out
shall we
it smells a little rough I'm not gonna
lie
it did tell me a few tries to get the
color even but it's not bad I just don't
like the smell of it it's like really
tastes like really kind of crayon e
whoops I don't know if I'm right on that
but it's pretty pigmented all right guys
this makes sure no my you-know-what
teeth this is the final look
I love the palette like I will just hit
myself in the mouth with it out I will
definitely be using this a lot homeward
this is so colorful and pretty oh my
gosh the highlighter I'm like I'm
obsessed like I'm so shook at how good
this stuff turned out because this seems
like a gimmicky kind of situation but
it's not at all actually it's really
great little bit lipstick it's I'd you
know pretty nothing wrong with it
the bold colors are really hard to get
even so it did take me a few pumps kind
of smells bad but overall looks good on
the lip so I don't mind it wow I'm
Chucky wookie this stuff is good
hallelujah praise the Lord
no kidding but like that highlighter
might be like my everyday highlighter no
it looks so good so that's my review and
I just honestly didn't expect it to turn
out this good but I'm glad that it did
so thank you guys so much for being here
and watching I love you guys so much and
I hope to see you all in my next video
