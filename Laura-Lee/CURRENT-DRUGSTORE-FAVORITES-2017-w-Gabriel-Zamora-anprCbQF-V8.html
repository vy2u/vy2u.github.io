drugstore products now I have a lot of
drugstore love I thought it was products
we can't find that drugstores know
Gabriel its current favorite drugstore
products like what you're loving now
from the drugstore my first product with
lemare foundation no baby does that
drugstore that's actually could it be
more opposite of the drugstore that's
not even comes close to drugstore having
his cost
I'll go hundred twenty dollars we'll
make it work let me go away we're going
to talk about products you can buy at a
drugstore yep and we're going to play
smash up s on and Gabriel channel can be
real weird for me if I'm married but
we're gonna make a happen what make it
work we're gonna make it work it's going
to be inappropriate at the time yeah
there's going to be like places makeup
brand make a product just different
things we share subscribe his channel my
channel
everyone channel on YouTube throw the
subscribe but now Mike's continuous
company
everybody gets love today and we'll go
ahead and get right and get started so
just I can't use lemare I'll use my
favorite drugstore foundation which is
my very first foundation ever this is
the l'oreal infallible Pro matte my very
first video had this under this is a
newer foundation so how long
Ankita movies what salt on you this is a
very first one like three years yeah I
just like it because it's yellow base
and it's like ten bucks and then this
one is the color 108 caramel babe I
think I love the timing definitely tried
that with my favorite like my favorite
hurt I think the Maybelline Matt and
Matt one but I like that one because I'm
an oily Mexican so he's drinking grass
over here will live along my favorite so
I don't technically I consider the choke
store do you consider la girl drugstore
you don't even know what joke store is
I'm happy
hahaha um I think I like girl trucks
right yeah I mean it may not be like in
CVS but this is a ten dollar foundation
so it's a drugstore price and I'm
absolutely loving it you get full
coverage out of it as well like you guys
have done a little bit of test a little
bit it like sticks to your skin really
well I do this is my color
careful let me elaborate like it's good
coverage it lasts for a long time you
don't get me crazy
did you hear them out um it's a little
it's a little dewy well doing hey this
is actually really good color my
favorite thing right now actually that I
was using two one um these are my
favorite makeup wipes everyone loves the
blue ones I like a good smell yeah they
smell amazing like the other ones it
just smells like makeup remover and not
in a bad way they smell good the blue
ones I'd like the purple ones a lot more
because they have lavender I think it is
and they don't burn your eyeball
oh and it removes the waterproof mascara
I do want to put mascara Lancome I never
do the roots of my lashes really these
lashes like they barely will stay on
with what you're doing a lot of it now
Lawson is our natural Isis for your
breath lately so my grass just you're
welcome in pain you won't so another one
of my favorite products when the
drugstore is a newer detailing my
current favorite so this is new product
this is the pixie contour palette
created by Miriam NYC and I just love
the color so she picked it's also very
pigmented the yellow is so pretty
here just set your under eye color the
blushes are pretty it's kinda like a
whole little face kit in here and great
shades I really like that because I
literally don't have any palette like
these are all my little drugstore thing
I don't have powders or anything these
I'm not the biggest fan of powders when
it comes to drugstore yeah because
sometimes they can be really like great
yeah boo shoes yeah I don't own a
drugstore powder because I'm really
picky when it comes to powder we didn't
actually really nice it's a nice palette
oh that's saw wait this is a bronzer
mm-hmm
isn't it Mariam lucky okay
yeah with the family bat shimmer coral
it's so pretty oh that's pretty
not even gonna line at Target I'm trying
yeah
who's you join one of my favorite
drugstore lip products that is actually
like a lipstick it's not like per se
like a lip balm I have one of their like
lip balm is this one this is the
infallible Pro matte gloss by L'Oreal
the name threw me because I was like
matte gloss oh my god it says yeah Pro
matte but I think it's like that
contradict there's X Pro because this is
aa foundation they have the pro matte
other stuff so I was like I'll be using
but yeah I was like from a clog
what is this literally it doesn't smell
that yeah it smells pretty it goes like
a semi matte it doesn't go fully matte
which I like and it's really good and
it's my L'Oreal so it's like drugstore
right great pricing yeah so okay no you
know I've never seen you wear it and
then I probably say I am loving to the
drugstore is the highlighting powders
from wet and get out of my shot to keep
zooming in and keep cropping a fabulous
highlighter
actually is one of the best drugstore
highlight I have so much sweetie you can
see anyone you can see where I don't you
know with it that yeah this is like that
of a high-end drugstore the only problem
is they sell out so fast you'll have to
find someone in the drugstore it
no that's pretty that's so pretty
that's drugstore with it oh they just
launched that new foundation that's
getting a lot of good reviews did you
have that fabulous
are you really amazing is that where I
saw it somebody I was like someone
reviewed it recently it's so good and it
even comes home this is my next product
ah even comes I forgot
gay so what I found was this duo lash
glue I was like this drugstore right
yeah cuz you can find us at Target this
one um this is only logical that I
actually use I don't know how you have
lash successfully that would rip up my
lashes how do you really do you like it
doesn't know I love this lash glue this
is my favorite simply because this is
the first one that I ever used because
they were um when I first started
wearing lashes are like use clear glue
you can use black you're going to make a
mess yeah I said if you like tap it yeah
so if you like tapping do the most so it
has like a little applicator which I
like a lot of last orders don't I got a
love that has that yeah and then it
dries clear it goes on like this
iridescent blue and then when it dries
it dries clear so I've used this for I
did a shoot with it see for glam bag and
I had to do freckles but glitter
freckles so I use this as a base who the
I just like literally with the
applicator I dabbed it on my face and I
would just get glitter and I would place
it where I put the glue because it dries
clear loves it love that next part Devin
loving from the drugstore this essential
a lot of love this is the makeup
revolution that vivid baked bronzer and
ready to go so what I've been doing with
this product it's so good I have been
just applying it on top of my contour
and it almost just gives like a glow to
your bronzer like just adds a glow right
that's actually really pretty yeah it's
beautiful this is a five dollar product
to Oh like you see it just like adds
like some shimmer into your bronzer so
like in person adds like a good it
almost looks like a blush bronzer
highlighter right
you could tell buddy to unlike your skin
tone you could use this as kind of a
I like you much then I'll so Michigan I
see we have a lot of products - yeah but
it's a really great product and I like
to take it and just like warm up my
bronzer like add some shimmer bronzer so
then it looks like I just walked off the
beach off the Baywatch set something
like that so whenever I don't wear
makeup I don't wear makeup all the time
like Laura like I don't need makeup like
my face just like shines without it
don't wear makeup I like to wear
products that are like really minimal so
that is not really about that you're not
a minimal girl named wig on your head
well I like how my wake up gray hair
coming coming off a good way people tell
me that my hair isn't like all gray you
tell me we're a whole lot of product
like let them grabbing lunch and I just
don't want to wear makeup but I want my
skin to look good so I put like creams
that make it really shine um but then I
like to actually use this this is a
Maybelline Baby Lips these are like
called crayon bomb to lure
Oh color brown crayon this is like a
French side already but it's like a bomb
but now they added tint to it
whoo it adds a common color I know but
it's really hydrating on the lips so
where you got it you got it what do you
do Laura you da man I like to apply it
almost like it's like a trend what is it
call back lipstick lip only popsicle it
popsicle Oh like to have a little color
so you have like a little bit of color
in the center and it just looks hydrated
my next and final product is some
looking is it from the drugstore you

but what colors is that this is my thing
okay that's not me because it's more
Brown

favorites this is a buff beige cannot
