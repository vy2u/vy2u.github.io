do you like my space buns actually
didn't even know they were called space
buns and too I posted a picture of them
with wearing them on Instagram and
everybody was like your space buns and I
was like my hair today's video is gonna
be very interesting because we're gonna
be comparing high-end makeup versus
affordable makeup was actually extremely
difficult I'm not gonna lie is extremely
difficult to find products that were so
similar let me tell you why I couldn't
just find dupes
for one another they had to make sense
in a makeup tutorial and not only that I
wanted to do is to do a pretty spring
makeup tutorial so like they had to make
sense like I couldn't have like a red
lip and a peach eye you know what I'm
saying with dupes like everything had a
flow so I actually spent a lot of time
coming up with products that worked one
another was difficult guys but I did it
and I hope you really enjoyed this video
I've kind of seen it floating around
YouTube and I thought I would try it out
be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave we're gonna jump right
in and we're gonna get started let's do
it
starting out we're going to start with
the facial primers for this side of my
face I'm going to be using the Make Up
For Ever step one skin equalizer this
one is from mattifying the skin and this
one's from mattifying the skin as well
is by Milani it's called their prime
shill with a mattifying primer I really
just like to push it into the skin kind
of like make it for everyone does feel a
little bit of a sixth thicker texture to
it and it's drying faster we'll just see
how this plays out but I want to kind of
like review them as I go for foundation
I'm going to be using two like
foundation Stix I wanted them to be kind
of similar like the product like I
wouldn't want to use a cream foundation
and a liquid foundation you know I'm
saying so I'm going to be using to make
it forever Ultra HD foundation stick and
the super BB by Physicians Formula on
this side so we'll start with this one
excuse me now we're just gonna blend all
our sorrows away
it's pretty obvious that the make it for
everyone had more coverage makeup over
is really good about coverage
foundations however this one was a BB so
I'm actually gonna add a little bit more
because bee bees are known for not
having a lot of coverage but it was the
only affordable stick foundation I had
on me and next up is for comfy a live
you guys have to hate what I say like
that anyways this is the LA girl Pro
concealer this is an HD definition
concealer and then this one is a Mac Pro
Longwear concealer that I'm gonna be
using this day first we'll go ahead and
do oh my god it like poof air in my
eyeball it scared me to death oh it's
gonna be blind
I'm the shade that I picked my la girl
one is a little bit more pinky tone I'm
just gonna do my nose with the Mac one
because I can't do like half my nose and
then this one by Mac is a little bit
more of a yellow tone so it is more my
color but we're actually going to talk
about more so like how the product works
I go in with a f-86 tapered kabuki of an
inch
I don't know how this concealer is going
to play out throughout the day but as of
right now
it looks the same as the Mac concealer
once I had it blended out look at that
really I set our concealer with Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD loose setting powder
versus the LA girl Pro powder the Rev
translucent powders both of these
powders will set my flash back on you if
you take a picture with a flash I mean I
just thought I should warn you guys my
goodness I can't pray and I can't tell a
difference between the two products so
far really white powder everywhere that
I will I'll tell you that moving on I'm
gonna opt for a powder contour today
instead of a cream contour this is my
favorite bronzer this is Laguna by NARS
she's a beaut I know and we're going to
compare it to the Physicians Formula
bronze butter butter blonde set that
backwards
they're very compatible this one's just
a smidge bit warmer but that both are
matte bronzers but have like the
slightest bit of shimmer so that's why I
thought they would be good to compete
it's gonna take it f10 british girl we
bout to carve out some shakes under skin
we're focusing more on
bronzing up the skin cuz I want to look
really bronzing for spring I can't tell
the difference I think both bronzers
were equally as good and blended out
equally as well for blush we're to
compare two blushes that aren't exactly
similar I had one that was more similar
but it broke so this is the Bobbi Brown
this was called shimmer brick and sunset
pink and then this is the Revlon this
one's called peach glow this one's
supposed to actually more of a
highlighter but I think it just has so
much call
extremely honest I was very disappointed
in the shimmer break because like
there's barely any pigment for the price
that's not cool not cool we're going to
compare to highlights my favorite cream
highlight is shale by Mac versus my
favorite drugstore highlight which is
Lila petal by elf cosmetics this cost a
dollar so I mean you can't beat it with
a stick
we're going for a very springy look
today and remember using the sweet peach
palette which will be back in stock very
soon I will link it down below anyways
but um smells like peaches then be using
some single really affordable eyes
shadows and its place for some of these
eyeshadows the first color we're gonna
start off is this cream color right here
and then for this time I'm going to use
color pops coppaFeel which is the exact
same color so this is the Too Faced side
this is gonna be coppaFeel top of film
may have been like literally the cyma
just bit lighter that will use Puri I
think that's how you say it it looks
like this for this side we are going to
be using flutes and it looks like this
they're just both kind of a caramel
brown color
now I'm going to take flutes my brush
yeah we're just gonna do the same thing
next I'm going to go in with summer Yom
which looks like this really just going
to blend that on that outer crease and
kind of work it and work I do for that
is cocoa bear by makeup geek and just
using the same brush I'm going to put it
in the same spot next one I'm going to
do is apply an extra base to the lid to
my colors pop I'll be using the Mac
Paint Pot and bear study on this
dockside and forever sand by Jordana on
this side Jordana when I like to Pat out
my finger first this one I do the same
thing I'm going to take just peachy
which is a really arid essent like pinky
peach color it's gorgeous and I'm going
to apply it more so to like the outer
corner I'll be using Mango Tango on this
side it has a smudge bit less arid
essence to it was like the closest thing
I could possibly find that was
affordable but you know what I think
it's going to turn out just fine if I
have to be honest I feel like the Too
Faced palette has a smudgy Bette more
pigment because I had to go in way more
times with the Mango Tango next I'll
take the shade that looks like this it's
called nectar it's like a yellowy cream
color and I'm going to apply that to
that inner corner you know what one
we're getting crazy I'll go ahead and
apply it to my brow bone this side I'm
going to take I'm peach List this is my
makeup geek and we're going to apply it
the same area
eyeliner I'm going to using wet-and-wild
liner on this side and my Sigma wicked
liner on this side for mascara I'm going
to be using the Tarte this is the lights
camera lashes and then I'm going to use
in the Milani runway lashes on this side
these are very similar mascaras in my
opinion for lashes I'm gonna be using
the Vegas nice shining star lashes on
this side and something very similar is
Kuwait by Lilly ghalichi oh yeah okay I
went ahead and added some eye shadow
mascara to the lower lash line but are
we using the Tarte in a rim liner as
well as the scandal eyes these are both
nude liners are great for the waterline
last things last is a lip is so what I
have for lips is the Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick and baki and then I have
the colour-pop liquid lipstick and
Bianca I will say that the liquid
lipstick my still has a little bit more
of a gray undertone versus the color
pump one you can kind of see it's more
pinky but overall they're so incredibly
similar I think that the still liquid
lipsticks are a bit more creamy and eyes
drying up you guys enjoyed this video by
the end result I I can't tell a
difference I think this eyes a little
bit more caramel which you can't tell
for real
however these lashes are smidge bit more
fool than these I don't know though
overall you really can't tell be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
