video is going to be a makeup dupe video
and I'm gonna be completely honest with
you guys it is so difficult finding
makeup dupes for the whole entire face
like I shergold because I can find a lot
of makeup dupes but they have to make
sense and look good on the face
altogether so I spent a buttload of time
trying to find makeup dupes I think I
did pretty well but I did spend a lot of
time blending and mixing colors trying
to make it work um these videos are
always fun to watch so I hope you guys
do enjoy the video because my Lord
raises in heaven ah it wasn't easy as
you can see we did a cut crease look be
sure and subscribe to my channel today
don't miss out on my craziness that I
put out on the internet for you to watch
be sure and subscribe join my youtube
hmmm today yes I should be on a plane
coming back from New York when this
video goes live all the products I use
in this video will be listed in the
description box down below so don't
forget to check it out and check out all
my other videos cuz I've been posting a
bunch of videos have you enjoyed the
video let's jump right in and get
started start out I just filled in this
eyebrow over here with my precisely brow
pencil from benefit and now I'm working
on this one over here with my NYX brow
pencil and expresso this one's a smidge
bit darker maybe but they are somewhat
dupes I find that the benefit one is
just a little bit more creamy but you
know what we're just trying to save some
dollars over here for my facial primer
I'm going to be using the NYX born to
glow illuminating primer against the
essay edit treat prep and glow facial
primer these are both luminizing facial
primers I will tell you the essay edits
formula is a little bit nicer it's got a
bit of a thicker texture to it they are
both good products and they both do the
same thing you
no they prepped the skin and get it
ready for foundation as well as giving
you a little bit of luminosity products
just a little bit thinner like you can
just tells it the other one is a richer
formula almost I want to sing more
foundation I'm going to be using the
l'oreal true much cushion against the
miracle cushion from lancome I actually
did a dupes foundation video and these
two were mentioned in it so I figured
I'd use them I like both of these
foundations a lot so I'm going to apply
the L'Oreal one right over here I'm
using a sigma f80 8 brush to do so I
will be using different brushes for each
side on my face so the products don't
transfer I'm going to take the Lancome
miracle cushion for this side and just a
Tarte little foundation brush these
products have like the exact same
coverage but it will tell you the
Lancome one smells really good for
whatever reason hmm in my face looks
pretty much the same on both sides I
just pulled a fuzz ball out of my mouth
I'm gonna use the master conceal by
Maybelline against the bare minerals
bare skin serum concealer these two
remind me so much of each other I don't
know if they're like declared dupes but
they just a very similar and their
coverage and texture and everything I
like keep forgetting I'm like which side
is my bougie side and which side is my
Walmart side
I'm going to use some morphe 49 brush to
blend out this side which is kind of a
similar brush they are not the same they
don't want my product to transfer my
bougie side I'm gonna use my bus ami the
same translucent powder this one is in
French vanilla which is like a banana
shade and then I'm going to use my NYX
CC powder in the shade banana for this
side oh say it looks like a banana let's
go to press it on in there don't a
little Purdy so I feel like I've come up
with some really cool dupes for eye
shadows I found actually two pallets
which were crazy similar this one is the
modern renaissance palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and it's just
really pretty warm tone colors and then
I found this one from Ulta beauty I
literally just realized this was a
collab with a youtuber how exciting miss
gin fabulous a huge congrats to you on
this palette like very warm tone and so
yeah I'm gonna use these as like dupe
daddy-o's doop doop doop adieu brazen
I'm gonna leave all this setting powder
on my face it's that way if the
eyeshadow has fall out I can sweep it
away with a setting powder and it won't
stick to my makeup or I'm going to
use this warm taupe and then out of the
Ulta palette I'm going to use the shade
called a fab they are extremely similar
I'm gonna take red ocher negs which is
just a really brick red color a hab
mitten which is a little bit cranberry
but it has a bit of a red undertone in
it so I really think they're gonna turn
out very similar once again I'm on my
eyes especially after I get it all
blended out I'm gonna shoot for a cut
crease on this look wish me luck
did it Sigma e65 brush which just helps
me get some color placement I just went
ahead and clean this brush because I
don't have another angle brush that's
that similar am I going to head and take
mitten so mitten is a little bit more
cool tone still going to try to work
that situation out I've to e36 brushes
from Sigma and I'm going to use one on
each side just softening that up
then take a little bit more of red ochre
and just deepen it up if it looks a
little messy on the outer corner do not
worry we will fix it with a little bit
of concealer now I'm going to mix
antique bronze and Cypress umber and hey
sugar bear which already has a little
sparkle to it and maybe just like this
midges bit of mint and mix them together
using an e25 brush from Sigma just to
let you know and now to really warm the
look up I'm going to take regular
have some concealer on this brush and
this is the part where I'm going to make
the cut crease come to life and then
we'll go from there so what is going on
over here we'll handle that in a minute
I'm going to take the more affordable
pilot and take Virgo and polish mix them
together and apply it to my lid remover
and tempura for these two this one and
this one and apply it to my eyelid I
have a clean gold f70 brush for my other
eyelid I'm gonna dust away my powder now
this is a morphe r7 this is the Roku
rose-gold of brushes eyeliner I'm gonna
be using the wet and wild gel liner
against the Inglot black gel liner
they're just black gel liner as you know
and they work so
for mascara I'm going to be using the
Tarte lights camera lashes and then the
Maybelline falsies push-up drama these
remind me so much of each other the
texture of them is very similar as well
as the lifting of the lashes I really
like both of these mascaras just so you
know only by this video that's not going
to be a doob is the eyelashes I don't
have lash tubes I've gone through all my
lashes in my last drawer and I have like
kiss Beauty lashes that are very amazing
and affordable but they look like none
of my higher-end lashes so I just wasn't
able to have that part I'm sorry guys
I'm going to be using the iris Beauty
lashes these ones are in Athena and they
are quite gorgeous lashes the thirst is
real today I'm going to take the brush
that comes in the fabulous palette to
tag fab again I'm also going to dip it
into a little bit mitten was that which
was that warm cranberry color lastly I'm
going to dip it into guru I know there's
a lot going on on the lower lash line
I'm going to take a Sigma E 57 and dip
into burnt orange and I'm going to go in
with a touch of Cypress umber to deepen
it up but take the Rimmel exaggerate
liner as well as the Tarte intagram
liner these are both new liners that
really can open up your waterline and
just make your Lima out-of-focus
it can really make your waterline look
very open and awake
explore blush and bronzer I'm going to
take my ELF blush and bronzer duo which
this one's been around the block a time
or two and then my NARS one as well and
this one is in Laguna and orgasm and do
some bronzing up and some blushing some
one place ly up two of the same brushes
this is the F of Phi brush from Sigma so
I'm going to take the orgasm blush from
NARS and take my sweet little elf blush
I'm going to take my NARS highlight this
one's in Luxor and the Doolin is a Lila
petal
they're both cream like stick highlight
for my lips I'm gonna do like a toasty
warmer color does this la girl Fluer I
think it's like five or six dollars and
then I have Kat Von D's Lolita two
they're not identical but they are so
super close
Oh
my la girl one is just like a smidge bit
lighter but we're gonna roll with the
punches and pretend that it's not
alright guys that's it for this video it
was a little bit difficult a little bit
challenging but I think we made it work
