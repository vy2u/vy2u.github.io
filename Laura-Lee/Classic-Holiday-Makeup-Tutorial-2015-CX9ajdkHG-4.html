video is going to be this makeup look I
love the way it came out I think it's
like a super classic makeup look it's a
pretty much a neutral cool tone eye
width
paired with red lips and added some
brown lip liner and they're just so it's
not like right also I'm gonna be using
the it cosmetics naturally pretty
romantic palette which is a super
gorgeous palette it's all matte color
love the way they have some purples and
pinks and greens and then a whole lot of
neutrals if you're a neutral person
you'll love this palette also it
cosmetics has given me an awesome
discount code it is listed down below so
check that out and it doesn't last too
long so be sure to take advantage of it
I'll have it in the description box but
I'm so excited to show you this tutorial
with this palette story of my life is
lipstick o'money hope you're excited to
see it be sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and you're
gonna make up a fire ourselves I'm
missing a nail I know okay first I'm
gonna go ahead and prime a face today
I'm using the cover FX mattifying primer
with acne treatment because my skin it's
not really being my best friend right
now and I'm just going to apply that all
over
next I will go in with the a cosmetic
cc+ lumination so this has a little bit
of illumination when you're gonna make
my skin glow a little bit
it also has SPF 50 I'm gonna protect my
skin from that Sun out there this is a
CC cream so it's not that heavy coverage
and I'm just gonna blend it out with an
F 88 kabuki I think this is a FA I'm
gonna grab the it cosmetics naturally
pretty romantics palette I'm gonna take
this first shade called peaceful right
here it's just like a cream matte color
I'm gonna blend it out all over the lid
just to soften up the eye primer as I
say in every tutorial this is just like
a staple thing that I do and it helps
the other colors blend so much easier I
promise you
I'm gonna pick up a little bit of
embrace which is this like light matte
brown color I'm gonna do this with an
e25 brush very pigmented as you can see
and I'm going to blend this softly into
the crease gonna take a little bit of it
and just kind of flick it into the outer
corner right there and then bring it
around to the crease
we have this conversation real quick the
palate isn't magnetic on the end and I
try to show you a color and it snatched
my earring like a girl in the nightclub
next I'm gonna grab a little bit of fate
which is a darker Brown kind of a
chestnut matte brown color runner just
grabbing a touch on the tip and I'm
really gonna start focusing this on that
outer corner pushing it inward I'm gonna
go back in with that 840 and I'm just
going to blend all this out I grabbed
this transforming pearl color which is a
shimmery light shade with this be 58
flat shader brush I'm gonna apply it
right into the lid I'm not gonna take it
all the way to the outer corner
I'm gonna pop that back same color right
on to the brow bone now I'm just gonna
pick up a little bit more of that fate
dark brown color and I'm just gonna
deepen up that outer V area just one
more time
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of the
hello lashes I'm just gonna pop this on
to the upper lashes right now I'm gonna
pop on falsies because no but if you
don't want to do that you can simply
just stick with adding it's a mask yo do
this with gorgeous lashes of yours now
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of the
Maybelline better skin concealer and I'm
just going to cover these dark ol
circles I'm gonna highlight in the usual
areas
now I'll take it f-86 kabuki and I will
blend this out so what I try to do
typically is to like Pat it out and then
if there's any left and I'll kind of
swipe it but I really want to keep the
color in the area that I put it in so
I'm not like pulling it down that way it
doesn't go too far but as you can see I
like push it into the skin and then I
will then start to blend it out
I'm gonna go in and set everything with
a little bit of the laura mercier
translucent setting powder
now I'm gonna go in with these lashes by
house of lashes I cannot remember the
exact name of them they are in New
Orleans ascription box I pop these bad
boys all cuz they are per day
if I've ever had a lash go on that easy
in my entire life and it was on camera
yes I go in with a little bit of the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and f77
brush from Sigma and I'm going to start
at the top ah yeah I'm gonna start at
the top of my ear and I'm gonna blend it
down for my contour to carve out these
little cheekbones here I'm just gonna
flicker it up making sure it is nice and
blended and then I'll just bring it
right around the hairline and hit the
temple area
our bladder may hate fetish from urban
decay which is just like a mommy color
gonna pop that on to the apples of the
cheeks and I'm gonna blend it on back a
little bit as for Hilah I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of the Laura Geller
gilded honey I'm gonna pop that on just
to give us that nice glue that way we'll
be fuzzy good I'm using the new fo3
brush to do so for the under eye I'm
gonna go back into my palette and grab
just like a touch of embrace and I'm
just gonna blend that right all the way
from the inner to the outer corner on
the lower lash line it's not too smoky
but just add a little bit of color that
way everything runs together and looks
nice
mas gonna grab some of that translucent
pearl powder and just pop it into the
inner corners to give us a little bit of
a glow yes honey but seriously like this
opens up the eyes so much I love this
color I mean a little bit of the hello
lashes at mascara I'm going to pop this
on to these lower lashes now grab a
little bit of the NARS coal liner and
just line that waterline top line a
little bit
okay now we're gonna do lips and then
we'll be done first I'll go in with a
little bit of chestnut by Mac and I'll
lightly line the lips outer corners is
hard to talk and do this but I'm trying
to fill in just the outer corners of the
lips we're going to be using the it girl
blurred lines which is like a bright red
career you should think that we wouldn't
last forever how could I have been so
wrong never thought I'd be the one to
say this but if our time is gone
think I don't need a watched it's all
the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
