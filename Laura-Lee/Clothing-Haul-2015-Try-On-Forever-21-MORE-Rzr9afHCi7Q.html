video is going to be a clothing haul I
have done I feel like I totally spit
everywhere whenever I said clothes
clothing home now that's all the way
today's video is going to be a clothing
haul I got a lot of stuff from forever21
and Toby
but you guys knows i'm a favorite places
shop and what else oh and then there's a
new place called 2020 Avenue super cute
stuff on there sighs I'm gonna be
sharing with you the goodies that I got
from them I'm pretty get started
hope you enjoy the video if you do don't
be shy give me a thumbs up yeah first
we'll start from the beautiful yellow
bag from forever 21 but first I got this
jacket it's just a plain black jacket
and honestly it doesn't fill all that
warm but I think it would be a really
cute staple fashion piece because just a
classic nice zipper black jackets wear
over anything and probably everything
really excited about that real excited I
got a piece that is not so much a wintry
piece but again it's just kind of like
this plane this plane crop top so and it
had like a little cutout at the bottom
which gives it some fun detailing in the
zips up all the way in the back I
believe this one was like 17 bucks
pretty affordable it is really thick
made and I bought a small but I should
have brought a medium because the small
feels way too tight okay I could wear it
with like a bazillion thing said that's
when I bought it next piece that I
bought is actually my favorite piece
this one was 24.90 which is a heck of a
deal for this jacket it's like a leather
pleather jacket but it has this taupey
color which this taupey color color and
it has this like crisscross pattern on
the shoulders it feels so soft and I
can't wait to wear it again it doesn't
feel that warm it feels kind of like
thinly made but it was $24 so you can't
be mad at that
and I'm gonna love it thank you my last
item from forever 21 we are moving fast
people what is going oh okay it is this
little top but it has fringy fringe on
the bottom I have been obsessed with
fringe like I hate what my armpits show
in the video I'm like I feel like
someone's going to screenshot and zoom
in and it's gonna get awkward don't do
that anyways it's just this little top
here he'll I keep my arm down because
it's gonna like this if you guys do it
has this fringe and its way took like if
my cats company oh you know what I got
this from Windsor I didn't get this from
forever21 we're gonna talk about it
anyways this was 27 90s it was almost
$30.00 cute but it's wait so Phillips my
cats come near me while wearing this
shirt it's gonna be a disaster
but it just zips up in the back and I
think it would be cute possibly like
paired with this jacket
I don't know I'm buying a lot of black
things because I love the color black
yes that is it from forever 21 we're
gonna talk about 2020 Avenue which is a
new boutique that I just discovered and
I got excuse me and I got a couple
pieces off of that boutique site my
favorite piece it's kind of an odd piece
that's like my favorite piece and it's
black of course but it is like this
little what do you call these leotards
is that what you called these do you
call these leotards I don't remember or
a onesie no it's not a onesie I
literally cannot remember brainfart
literally imagine this tucked in some
leather pants with that taupe leather
jacket over and a chunky necklace what
that is my full intentions to do with
this I just love it I love how like the
bra is like Cubs so it's gonna lift up
the minis and make them all happy and
juicy that was disgusting we find
something one thing that I did get that
isn't black which is a very weird piece
and I hope it's gonna look good on
because I haven't tried it on while
talking to you I'm gonna try on all this
stuff after and clip it in that way you
guys can see I don't even know like
what's happening where does it start and
where does it end it's like it's just a
piece of cloth but this is a really cute
dress from 2020 Avenue I hope it's not
gonna be too short for me but I thought
homeland
when I saw it on I was like I would
never buy that and then I was like then
I have to get it because I have to like
switch up you know sometimes whenever
you're like I would never wear that then
it's just like just get it and wear it
and enjoy it
I know you guys can't see the little
fuzzies but there's like little fuzzy
Slotin around get the olive green which
has become my favorite color to wear
this font talked about it a good bit and
it's just a super soft cheap dress that
is kind of oddly shaped but I'm really
excited about it again with the fringe
and black so I got another pair of pants
that are suede fringe all down the side
and they're black right up my alley
and I think they're gonna be really cute
on with like a strappy hill and I don't
know what shirt but a cute shirt I don't
know it better be cute but they feel
really comfy because they're really soft
and squishy Eisley from there I got a
little sick so girls and it's the
lace-up dress in the front like it laces
all the way up I typically have to wear
a bra with no matter what I wear because
my boobs are real so they just like to
like it gets tricky so I'm gonna try out
the whole taping mechanism and see if I
can't tape my girls up and see if
they'll hang out all perky and happy
with this dress if not well then they're
just gonna hang low this super sexy
dress maybe I'll wear it out to dinner
one night in LA I look cute on the model
online now let's talk about Toby first
piece I got is actually a set and I love
the color of it because it's not black
and it's actually something different in
my closet oh my closets gonna like throw
it out be like you know is this little
pencil skirt and it has lace detailing
on the bottom it's supposed to be pretty
tight and I already wore the crop top
out because my guy was so cute so a
turtleneck with like a mid turtleneck
it's not like the full term neck I'm
doing a dedicated turtleneck today this
is like a non-dedicated turtlenecks like
halfway couldn't decide if I wanted to
go fool or not so it's like a half these
and it's maroon zips up in the back and
it has the exact same lace detailing on
the bottle love the shade love
as Elvis I will probably wear because
it's not cold at all here it's like in
the 80s but if I wore that while it's
chilly or at nighttime I would probably
wear like a pea coat over it just a cozy
look then I got another pair of black
pants wow that's different pants and
they are really nicely made like they're
super thick and handy-dandy and then at
the bottom they scrunch up so they have
like some ruching at the bottom I'm like
elastic and they are elastic band pants
I figured this would be so cute with a
shirt tucked in and like a pea coat over
it with a strappy heel like that is my
style so I keep buying things that like
are my style because it's my style I
don't know but I'm really excited to
wear these they're gonna be cute I can
assure you I love pieces that are said
so I got another one and it is like this
topi pink color which I love the taupey
color for fall because it's not like
bright pink so you're not spring but
you're still wearing brighter colors but
you're still fall time ish I don't know
where I'm going with this but I'm going
somewhere and it is like a swushi skirt
because it like pulls up as you can see
right there whoop it pulls up in the
front it's an elastic band and then it
comes with this little tanky top and
it's wrinkly because it was laying on
the floor and not on a hanger I need to
get my life together I know it's gonna
be super cute now here in California
it's like really warm like 90s 80s
during the day and then nighttime the
temperature drops so I buy a lot of
pieces that are like tank top with pants
and stuff and then I'll throw a jacket
or peek over my shoulders just the
warming up at nighttime it's like all
about layering clothing here because if
I will more like a long sleeve shirt and
long pants out I would have a heat
stroke during the day and be comfortable
at night so you're just gonna layer up
and that's why a lot of my fall pieces
are still kind of summery but just know
I typically not typically I always have
a jacket with Mesa AKM jackets our last
piece here whoa almost got slapped in
the face
this beautiful coat and I got it just
for New York because I want to feel like
a New Yorker while I'm back in New York
I was in New York last week and I'm
going next week and I just want to look
like a New Yorker
I'm a Californian so I got this nice
like this is a New Yorker jacket right
or any of my followers from New York
what do you guys think
total New Yorker it's a really long wool
pea coat and it's super nicely made I
got it at Toby and it's gonna go with
everything and I am gonna be Sarah
Jessica Parker in New York maybe not
maybe Miranda who is your favorite
Carrie I like here I like someone's it
the best Who am I kidding that is it for
this clothing ha hope you guys enjoyed
trying these clothes on

you like a more of a perspective of what
they actually look like I'm give this
