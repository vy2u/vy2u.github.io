today's video is going to be big old fat
close at home because I went shopping
I feel like clothes go out of style so
fast that last week everything in my
closet just now sucks and I have to
rebuy everything like what is happening
can we slow that down a little bit maybe
I just seen it by cooler clothes get a
lot of new clothes I want to share with
you guys this is gonna be a try on haul
so you will actually be able to visually
see what the clothes look like on dev
and from forever21 it's perfect for
back-to-school but a lot of the other
items that I got that I'm going to show
you after is it forever 21 is not so
school appropriate also got a few
accessories I'm going to share with you
first we'll start with forever 21 and
then we'll move into a couple places
online that I did orders I'll have every
website linked down below so you can
check them out too
but yeah so we're just gonna jump right
into this video we're gonna get started
and I'm gonna show you my new clothes
okay first let me show you a couple
accessories I got I got three pieces so
nothing crazy but I got this gorgeous
necklace from happy all the accessories
all the juries from happiness boutique
is a really pretty silver necklace very
jangling like a little gypsy more of
like a piece to wear out at night not
like an all day piece because if I hear
this all day or if someone near me has
to hear that all day like I would I
would snatch their necklace off their
next oh the next pair of earrings that I
got are just absolutely over-the-top
glamorous it's a 10
these are 12 these earrings are so
beautiful from Happiness boutique I'll
have a link down below but they're just
you're going out or have anything to
celebrate you better have these earrings
in your ears okay people
they're just gorgeous and I love the pop
of neon corn corner color blast pair of
earrings I have worn so much and I
didn't get these that long ago but I
mean I'm sure people or let Laura you
can take the earrings out of your ears
now quit sleeping in them these are just
so cute and the things that I like about
these the most is the fact that they're
lightweight because this chandelier
car is a cloth so it's like a little
string rather than a metal so it's not
very heavy in your ears they are
razzle-dazzle shimmy shencheng beautiful
and I just love them and they match
everything black and I wear black all
the time I mean hello now we'll jump
right into the forever 21 section first
I got this hat sometimes whenever you're
in forever 21 and you're just feeling
very hipster and you just want to change
your style and do something new and you
say something such as this hat and
you're like you know what
I'm gonna buy the Hat and I'm gonna rock
the Hat and then you get home in your
life what the hell did I just find what
is this why is it sitting on my head so
weird maybe if I wear like this but I
still feel no this hat it's like so big
on my head too like I could go all the
way around and it's just and I got size
small size small what is wrong with this
hat that hat it was a big mess and you
know Forever 21's policy 21 days for
exchange only worth receipt in that
receipt is God knows where I'll give it
to someone I hate just kidding I would
never I don't hate anyone because let me
tell you something
hating people takes away too much energy
full of love and rainbows over here okay
people this shirt probably isn't
appropriate for school but it's a good
phone leader one cat here all over it it
is a good staple of black crop top and
when you're in a rush no idea what
you're wearing you can pair this shirt
with basically any bottoms blue jeans
black jeans tan jeans a skirt
anything you want to shorts and it's
probably gonna match because it's just a
plain black crop top and I think this
was like five dollars and 80 cents next
week I got was which was another one of
those moments where I was like I'm gonna
buy something different I got this and I
actually absolutely adore it I love this
piece so much if it cost a hundred
dollars I would repurchase it for $100
fortunately for me I was like 18 bucks
but is this weird piece because I go
it's like a little shirt but it goes all
the way down to like the bottom parts of
your legs and it's long-sleeve and it's
kind of flannel filling but it's not too
thick where you won't get too hot
wearing it I love the red and black
color of it
just I love this piece so much I plan on
rocking it when it gets a little bit
cooler I try to pick up pieces for
cooler weather because they get like
balled up you know what I mean like and
then there's nothing left so I try to
pick up what I can so that leads me to
the next piece that I picked up which is
a white sweater which is perfect to
throw over basically anything and I love
pieces like this in my closet that I can
wear a bazillion times over not like
wear with one outfit and then it's done
forever really good lightweight sweater
and it's the white material so it's
gonna match everything and I plan on
just throwing over my tank tops when I
wear shorts and stuff the last piece I
got from forever 21
oh wait and then I got this shirt I'm
wearing here from forever 21 I have worn
this shirt to death and I just got it I
think it's adorable I love this shirt so
much it's so comfy it's really loose and
light for summertime and it has these
little holes in it and it looks like my
cat stored the pieces they may have I
got a shirt okay this is just like a
plain white little shirt I got here in
the net like ties in the middle I just
thought it would be a good shirt to wear
for with it whatever you know I don't
know I just thought it'd be a cute
little shirt to pair with anything and
everything that is all from forever 21
now I will jump in with the next items
that I got actually I got an accessory
from this store and I'll show you it too
but from Belle Rouge gems is a drawer a
boutique online and they typically only
sell jewelry but they're coming out with
some really cute dresses so I got two
the first one is like this Jersey
material great t-shirt it comes way past
your knees which I'm loving that style
the back of it is just the real true gem
to this shirt it's so unique and cute in
the back I love the zipper detailing
that goes all the way down your little
honey whoo
so cute I love love love this dress and
it will be worn out oh it will be worn
out next dress is just oh it's so pretty
I normally wouldn't necessarily go for
this color until I put it on and now I
love this olive green color it is such a
cute dress the dress is very fitted and
spandexy I like that about it I do need
to wear Spanx with it because you can
see my
an outline in the dress and God forbid
the underwear you can see everything in
this dress just because it's that silky
stretchy material but it does go past
the knees and it is tank top and it's
super comfortable super super super
comfortable because it stretches and
anything that stretches this comfy from
Belle Rouge gems I also got this
gorgeous necklace this piece is just so
monster drama I love it so much it looks
like it's metal but from far up it's
just a bunch of rhinestones mushed
together to really keep pattern an
adorable necklace that will match
anything in everything okay I didn't
order from Toby and I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret of mine with Toby
Toby is and somewhat affordable if you
get a discount code website with a crap
ton of clothing that have like so much
to choose from on that website it's not
too too expensive but it's not always
the best prices in the world if you
don't have a discount code what I like
to do with Toby is whenever a season is
starting to come to an end such as
summer I go over to their clearance
because Toby's clearance are extreme
markdowns like most of the shirts I got
were five dollars apiece the dress is
for ten dollars apiece maybe one dress
was 15 bucks the most up paid for
anything out of this haul was 15 bucks
but you have to go like as the season's
ending or else it all gets balled up and
there's nothing good did indeed catch it
when a season was ending they might
still have this stuff if they do I'll
link it down below but they run low on
sizes and stuff but whenever I shop
there 3 or 4 days ago from filming this
video they have they were loaded up with
stuff in sizes on their sole section the
first dress that I just oh I love this
dress so much it's a little bit darker
than an olive color it's like a hunter
green and then it has black detailing
around the arms of the dress it is so
pretty it's just this very very very
nice material it is extremely heavy
though so it might be a little hot to
wear it out during the day because it's
so nicely made like the material of the
dress it's just like heavy but I like
that about it because I like knowing I'm
gonna be able to wear something without
washing it one time and it fall apart
let me show you the next dress that I
got I like
I don't want for you guys and then threw
it in the floor so that way that made my
life are really difficult good job Laura
all right the next dress that I got is
this plain purple dress I love plane
stuff again for whenever I had a beauty
event or something I need to go to it I
can just grab something simple and dress
it up oh my gosh oh my gosh these
earrings in this dress yeah and it is
very stretchy very comfortable and it
has some unique detailing because one
side is like longer than the other
that's becoming a trend and I really
like that trend but you know next week
it's not gonna be a trend anymore I got
in the exact same color just a pencil
skirt it's the exact same color as the
dress and I didn't realize that so I got
it but that's okay because I'm gonna
wear it anyway dress it up with a
colorful top but just needed a good
pencil skirt you know oh my gosh so this
little jumper might be my favorite piece
jumpers are weird on me because my I
don't have a weird shaped body like my
stomach is this long widget that long
and my legs are long but my stomach
short but I'm a normal height I don't
know what's going on with my body it's
just weird so a lot of time robbers like
will bunch up in the center for me
because my abdomens not long this one
did not it actually fit me really well I
got this one inside small from Toby and
I love the some is super super super
summer tiny but I think you could throw
a jean jacket over it or something and
kind of weird as we transition into fall
the next piece is just so stinkin cute
and I don't know what I'm gonna wear
with I think it would be cute with like
white jeans this pink little top a
little bustier I guess you would call it
it has like the boot cut out it is a
little bit big for me let's see I got it
guys how small and like my mom I'm gonna
have to ship it to or she'll have to cut
these and make boot straps and make them
shorter for me and maybe take it in some
house it's a little big which is weird
because with the boob thing I normally
don't have trouble with but I don't know
we're gonna see and trying to make it
work maybe I'll stuff my bra no it'll
work at the next piece I got um it's a
kind of a little weird piece but I think
it's so cute I'm gonna be wearing this
not anytime soon because it's
long-sleeve and it's a really thick
metier
real but winner will be here before you
know it and we'll have three cold days
in California and I will wear this one
of those three days say blue in red
plaid long-sleeve crop top and I think
it's gonna be so cute paired with the
white right outfit I don't know I'm kind
of thinking black jeans and boots no the
next piece is something I typically
wouldn't buy because I don't do flowy
much it just looks weird on my body type
but I actually got this tried it on and
loved it the shirt was a whopping five
dollars as was that crop top so I mean
you can't be mad at it if it doesn't
work out for you right by the way all
the sell stuff on Toby is final sells so
you better love it if you get it they do
love this shirt so much you're gonna see
me wearing it around it's just a cute
little really lightweight green and
white little top it's completely sheer
so you can see all the way through it
but I'll probably wear like a bando or a
nude bra underneath it and as I was
trying it on for the video I realized
how cute it looked with the pencil skirt
so I'll probably just tuck it in a
neutral color pencil skirt and rock it
all day long last shirt I got from Toby
comm that which was five dollars as well
it's the sheer little crop top and it
has the fringe on the end I love French
anything I love print on my shoes my
purse is just fringe on everything okay
people maybe that's what my hair looks
so Frenchie also has embroidery like a
floral print on the front of it and I
just think it is a cutie patootie I
believe from Windsor I bought two skirts
one I love and one might go back because
it turns out it looks kind of weird on
me first one is a pleather skirt
I'm not a leather skirt and I don't know
this one was 1990 so it was a pretty
good price for a fake leather skirt and
I could wear it with so much stuff
because it's like um I don't know I just
needed a good staple pleather skirt I
had one from forever 21 the zipper bust
out of the back and then I bought
another one from forever 21 and it just
looked like garbage so this is my third
try and it better work the last piece
that I have to share with you guys that
might go back to the store
because it's looking a little weird on
me I don't know you guys are gonna be
like girl just return it but this one
was twenty four ninety he did a tan
skirt I don't have an any type of
neutral pencil skirt and have so many
cute crop tops that I need to pair with
a neutral skirt and that's why I bought
it but I rushed it on this one because
it's just we shaped weird it's shaped
for a curvy girl with a lovely
bootylicious booty um and this girl
ain't got that so all the clothes that I
got were very affordable I hope you guys
enjoyed this haul sorry if I talked like
so much through the whole thing but I
just wanted to talk about my clothes
with you guys you're my best I hope you
