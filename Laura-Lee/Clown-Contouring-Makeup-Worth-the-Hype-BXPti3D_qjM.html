video is going to be an experimental
video as you probably start with the
title and the thumbnail on this video we
are gonna try out clown contouring I
don't manage get it all over me don't
see it being the biggest success in the
world because mastering the art of cream
contouring can be complicated as it is
so clown contouring I can't imagine
being much easier but we're going to try
it out we're gonna see what happens I'm
kind of nervous never tried it out
really excited to do it I mean what if
it turns out amazing
we just don't know if you're interested
sing as clown contour then just keep
watching I'm going to do any foundation
because we're about to put on like so
much Matt grupe so it is first we'll
start out with the under eye in a word
on the street is the red is canceling
out the black on the under eye or the
darkness on the under I mean that's just
like the two huge Pintrest trick I've
seen floating around the internet so I'm
going in with this orange corrector
which I guess it's pretty similar to the
red so we'll do we'll get rid of some
darkness now I don't see this blending
out well without a little bit of
concealer that's like a lighter shade to
mix in with it will add a little bit of
that within it so how it's a little bit
of redness right here a lot of redness
right there Who am I kidding now I'm
going to take a little bit of this
better skin concealer by Maybelline and
I'm just gonna like
I'm going to do like that which might
help us blend it out blend it out
together I don't know what's happening
to me
typically I would do down the nose and
maybe we'll do some dots to the forehead
we'll make it sprout like a little plant
and I'm also going to add some yellow
into the forehead and that way it blends
into my skin tone better have this
yellow concealer from la girl this one
is in yellow corrector well I like the
tip of the nose with it and now I'll do
the chin which I think I'm gonna do
polka dots to highlight the chin up the
yellow blend within our skin a little
bit more I'm gonna go in with some of
the regular concealer and just add polka
dots Ellie you're supposed to add some
redness around your mouth to help me I
do get a little bit of darkness on the
mouth so why not write like a psycho
killer and now I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of that better skin just to
help us out there with the blending it
out oh I'm going to go in with this
cream blush since everything's all cream
it's like clown cheeks I mean that is
some crazy pigment and blush
holy this I'm scared to use this now on
its own like with breaking their makeup
we haven't contoured anything yet
so now I'll go in William bisque you I
believe it.what is pronounced and we're
going to contour our face
yeah that's a good color and we'll just
do polka-dots to give us that beautiful
clown like appearance all the way up and
around like circling our face as you can
do these in your own design huh I don't
know what's happening to me right now I
should be fired off of youtube good
thing I can't be fired we can't forget
down the nose so I'm just gonna do the
regular straight line down the nose
bring it around do the chin cuz you guys
know I like to do this little I feel
like my contour is in very dark so it's
not gonna work out very well so I'm
gonna go in with a little bit of a
darker shade honey use a little bit of
beautiful bronze with just one of the LA
girl bronzers and I'm literally just
gonna add a little bit within original
dots that way it just blends out to be a
little bit darker
and someone please tell me what's
happening to me I don't understand I'm
scared I'm honestly I'm scared that's
not only I don't see that it looks like
a clown and that is no one's fault of my
own now I'm going to start blending this
out with my trusty dampened beauty
litter honestly I don't know where to
start cuz I'm scared
I guess I'll start with a contour and
just start dabbing and he'll oh and I
officially have a beard I think that's
my own fault for putting the darker
contour I just didn't see the other one
even like showing up it looked too light
for me but maybe I was wrong yeah yeah
wow this may be wrong I don't know who I
worst contour I've ever given myself now
I'll just blend out the under eye and
it's actually looking a little bit soft
as we're blending this out like it's
maybe not too hard we'll go back over it
with a little bit of the lighter
concealer to see if we can't make it
doable I don't know maybe not yeah I
don't see this I don't see this being
fixable at this point um maybe just
pulling out the highlight soften my
forehead doesn't look like the end of
the world bad really I mean it's not my
hairline so that looks a little crazy
but my forehead isn't you know
completely I mean there's a lot great
bits I completely horrible um
the redness is a big no I think I used
way too much product and I didn't
realize it because typically I just do
the regular contour my blush is a huge
no it just blended right in with the red
honestly and it's horrible mouth never
needs red around it ever like that just
turned out bad in with concealer at and
on
the chin not so bad looks like anywhere
I did the regular concealer and stuff
not so bad but anywhere where to put the
red I just want to cry nose is pretty
good I mean what happened to me I'm
gonna take off some of the red look
better already
and I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
our regular concealer and just try to
fix that because that was a fail I made
it I experimented but it was a sell I
don't recommend this though I don't
recommend doing what I'm doing right now
especially if you have somewhere
important to be such as a job interview
a fur to date actually anything at all
no the under eye looks better yeah we
don't wait too much redness through here
maybe I'll try to take it down a notch
my patients need Jesus isn't spoon man
day like their regular concealer color
around the mouth and the chin they an
old man is it the work people this is a
lot of work to turn a clown into a woman
my face is not the same color as Manette
because I did my contour way too hard I
wiped off some of the red which I think
I went in lighter with a red it would
have been way better but I went hard on
the redness around the nose seem to be
fine oh I just have on so much makeup
right now oh I'm not gonna say it was a
total fill on though between me and you
we both know it was I just didn't want
this to be a film but I I think I don't
I don't understand clown contouring the
greatness of it I think maybe mastering
cream contouring just the light and dark
by itself and maybe a little bit of red
or green correct in the under eye area
okay but maybe a little bit of the green
to correct
redness if you had that um the red to
correct the darkness
I don't know maybe just a little bit of
that and once you mastered that maybe
you can jump into clown contouring but I
love cream contouring my face but clown
contouring is not my best friend and I
probably won't be doing it um ever again
pepper is lennick him ever and she was
literally like I don't even want to know
I think that I killed this whole thing
by using this and I shouldn't happen I
didn't know okay I thought it was clown
contouring hope you guys enjoyed the
video hope it was somewhat entertaining
to you anyways I love you guys thanks
for being here give me a thumbs up maybe
just for trying I hope see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
