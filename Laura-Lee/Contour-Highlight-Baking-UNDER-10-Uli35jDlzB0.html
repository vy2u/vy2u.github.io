video is going to be how to contour your
face for under $10 good food today today
digging the focus on this video today is
gonna be about contouring contouring
contouring and highlighting highlight
Holly that's it it's not going to be
about blush not going to be about like
highlight highlight will be about
foundation not going to be about
eyebrows eyelashes going to simply be
about contouring and highlighting and
baking your face and just getting that
really nice structure that you always
hate on Instagram I'm going to show you
how to do it and extremely like the most
affordable way that you could ever
possibly do your contouring and
highlighting so I hope you're ready for
this I'll be sure to subscribe to this
channel for you leave because we're
doing all kinds of videos like this save
that money don't want to miss out on
that okay I know you don't 3-inch up
running to get started and you enjoyed
the video jumping right in this tutorial
we're going to start with the LA girl
concealers these are very popular a lot
of pro makeup artist uses on their
clients these are normally around $2 a
piece if you buy them from the LA girls
site they're $5 apiece but drugstore
calm and a couple of other sites they're
about $2 apiece
today I'm going to be using shake creamy
beige they only have nine million shades
to choose from they ain't facetious but
they really do have a lot of chases
choose from and you normally want to go
one shade lighter than your foundation
shade if you want to get really crazy
with your highlight you can go two
shades lighter than your foundation
shade and that before then I'll take a
picture and be like oh I went a little
bit too light starting out highlighting
highlighting is gonna push out areas and
make them brighter so you don't want
sunken in eye sockets which happens to
the best of us so you're going to push
them out and get the illusion that they
are puffy and bright and awake so that's
why we put this under our eyes and also
cover sharp circles and not only that we
typically do like this triangular shape
because that's the way light naturally
hits going down and triangular shape so
it gives more of a natural fill we can
put a little down the nose have a video
on contouring your nose on the forehead
I've said this a hundred times but I'm
going to say it one more time one more
time if you have a small forehead you
want to bring your highlight up making
it look maybe a little bit
dream if you have a big forehead you and
make your highlights smaller and you'll
make your contour a little bit more deep
too because it illusion you have a
smaller forehead so now I round chin oh
here is our highlighting areas I
typically will do a little bit right
here take oh I should do this onto my
face I'm going to be using the same
concealer button cool no this one is
inexpressive no listens and beautifully
bronzed I told you to get a lot of
shades and so what I'm going to do it
just put a little right ear to make my
bottom lip look a little more clumpy you
guys know the routine with the cheekbone
thing carve out those cheekbones honey
forehead looks smaller I don't really
want to make before look smaller so I
just put a little bit get that nose okay
I really like these because the brush is
on them you can get really precise with
your placement on these now I'm going to
blend all this out you want to make sure
whenever you're blending out the product
that you really don't want to move it
around too much as you see we work so
hard to put it in a particular area that
we don't want to move it and make it all
crazy these products blend out really
easily so I'm just gonna do a dabbing
motion rather than a swiping back and
forth blend out the highlight and now
we'll get into the console I am gonna
pull the contour bit into my hairline um
because my hairline is like so wide up
in there really obvious that my hair
stops my scalp starts we want to make
sure not let anybody know that's going
on as far as affordable tools go on
Amazon they have a vert their version of
the Beauty Blender for one dollar
it may not be as soft but it does get
the job done and I have used my fingers
before which are free to blend out my
contour it takes a little bit longer but
it works it's a quick tip that damper
your Beauty Blender is though it makes
it a little bit easier to blend all this
out I'm personally happy with my outcome
now if you see an area like it's a
little bit too dark for a little bit too
light you can um add a little bit more
a little contour at this point is when
you would touch it all so our next
affordable product Mesa portable product
were gonna be using is the NYC smooth
skin loose powder and this one is in I
don't know it's just translucent I think
they have two or three shades in this
one I tease this little sponge you're
typically just comes in any cheap makeup
or expensive makeup whatever it's just a
sponge or I would really love this this
is by Sigma this is the chisel and trim
f77 I'm going to display one on this
side of the face and one on the other
side the face you can choose whichever
you would like to use better it's just a
good options I like to put out there
definitely giving you the affordable
options well though what I like to do
and why you see people do this number
all the time is because that right there
it's going to sharpen that contour and
give you like that nice crisp clean cut
outline especially if people into it a
little too low and got a little bit
messy don't worry I got you covered
same thing chin under that and I'll even
do on the side of the nose like that did
you get a little choo-choo train this is
a heavy form of makeup baking your
makeup is gonna make it last longer look
more flawless
I think I'm inhaling the powder well let
this sit here for between five six seven
minutes a month a year by the way
whenever you're biking you're letting
your skin heat up the powder and it's
just like cooking it into your skin and
that's why you let it weigh cuz your
natural body temperature heats up the
powder coat seen your skin set your
makeup flawless a and then you can dust
it away I'm just going to use a F 25 you
can use any powder brush you have on
hand or any to have a big fluffy brush
or you can even use your little sponge
to dust away
and while on our face has been contoured
highlighted it has been cooked it has
been swept away and we have like this
completed flawless flawless skin look so
that is it for this video this is the
final look I did add my highlight and
blush but like I said the video is about
contouring and highlighting not really
about all the other jazz I do my
highlight and blush and every single
makeup tutorial that I've ever done I'm
scratching my boob be sure to subscribe
before you leave and I'll see you in my
next video bye guys I love my hair today
so I braided the top the braid and then
I bobby pin this little bun and then I
do have my extensions in today
