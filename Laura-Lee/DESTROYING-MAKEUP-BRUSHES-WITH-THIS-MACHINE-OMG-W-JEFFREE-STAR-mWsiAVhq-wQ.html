so catchy yeah thank you I'm going to
iTunes this fall that's right okay let's
get into it okay what the hell going on
well we had this magical water that has
the funnel with my fish go and Laura
only uses bottled water a lies and
slander right now Solan we're going
cleaning your wrist all the way here so
smoothly I know I know I think those tap
water is this even safe to drink okay so
how does this how does this work got my
soap
we got soap it's set to fill it only the
bottom piece because you're supposed to
discipline it in the water and then lift
it and let it dry while it's in here and
I swing the water off so that's why you
only put a little bit of water in there
it comes with these rubber little tube
things they go on the end of the machine
shove your brush looks like Manny's but
play oh we're missing one yeah are we
too sexual
it's really good so look nice very good
so these are for your different brush in
okay um and then so let's see so example
we really need real brushes here we got
my contour brush oh so you don't give me
a Brit nice brand that's a nice one oh
she wants to know I want to warn you I
you know Burberry no I'm not tearing up
a Burberry I want a what if we don't
have it's not tired of exactly this one
to put in it there who cares
okay fine I'm the highest Vav Rouge
point person on Sephora this is good so
I just like the side-packer
no I know I'll probably use your points
go in there say some different star
looks like what his phone number and you
can give me a point - here we go
okay he gave me all this Ulta points I
got like yeah I know idea also had a
membership in my hall or - oh all right
all over the place and I sure didn't use
my phone number so you put that thing on
the thing haha thing on a thing and
another thing and the other thing on the
thing like Ellen by the way this pops
off if you need it - but what you can't
put them all once no I think I thought
you stuff like this seven of them in
there they'll fun okay that is
monstrosity thought for real Geoffrey no
but all of them somehow went in there
can you imagine all pitch brushes going
crazy
somewhat I've been in that dirty let's
show a real one
all right try one that's like this one
you'll see it's really where I use all
my eye today so why don't we try it okay
so let's get if we're going to try this
let's get the tiny airbending Ram be
quiet turn your whole this tiny are all
here it is right here on shove the brush
in there oh yeah that fits tight oh and
then we'll put the little square you get
my channel age-restricted I know every
time and then I put a little drop of
soap in here it sends to put four
milliliters I'm not fucking counting
that no so just to look it to pop like
one drop no no it's not a lie that's a
good milliliters is like that is not
necessary breath well it's not going to
be for long okay it says to spin the
brush in the water and soap for 10
seconds sprays my face that is where
this video will go viral
America wants to see that happen
we go blind I was a small audience out
there that does they're truly okay great
so I'm holding the bowl if you lift the
brush and let it spin drying for ten
seconds it is just minute before we even
put in the water ready oh yeah garbled
you're not getting goggles cut nervous
you're gonna hold it so it says just put
like the tip bristles are you ready 1 2
3 4 9 10 and then we okay I'm dirty I
see the fill type of thing my brush cars
are going to break look terrible other
worthless car wash three just driver
classroom you come up with a feel
disgusting but it's just torn up hold
this okay
gradually we're going to try one of my
brushes shit is tight oh my god I can't
get it off oh shit I can't get it off
okay well let's do the squeezing test is
it water al no there's no water there's
dry is 100% dry did I not put it I felt
like I had to put it in the water how
would it above old it do it again I am
asked right now I'm amazed to help
stupid business and the hole put in your
hole 10 seconds in the water and then
finish what you started okay fine okay
ready
oh yeah we're better touching the base
yeah all right hole in their deep how do
we get I'm ovulating I don't even know
what's happening right now I I think I'm
dead ready Cuba it's disgusting
thank you sir for breath okay oh but the
brush is in the same filthy condition
it's red but like try it on my skin huh
maybe we stain this brush whoever is
watching all right but I think our IQs
are so fucking low I just one that has
soft brown yeah all right let me do this
one canister casting yet it came with
batteries in case you did it did come
with powder in how much is this by the
way I don't know I found it in your
kitchen we'll go with the price in five
seconds where we reviewing for a living
okay
this is a Chanel brush completely
unnecessary to clean this expensive
brush so why would we clean expensive
brushes because we're going to destroy
this beautiful brush oh it's fine yeah
whatever she says
hey Macarena one market supermarket
Macarena how are you do for in second
thought I'm baking a cake let it dry
my thing is I need it clear rinse like
I'm not just going to dry it out of the
soap I'm all right it's not that it's
like it's dry feels pretty dry the brush
hairs look a little different let's just
show the bristles real quickly they look
sad and then you can manipulate it back
yeah kind of go like they look a little
it looked like my god my brush this
little main goal it looks like it's been
through a hard time
listen look like this before yeah I'm
not trying to be funny wait this looks
like it is bigger something it looks sad
this looks like it was home for years
and then he came back home okay what is
that we want to try a bigger brush okay
and is that for this is for concealer
underneath the eye so it's a cream
product on this nice and built up in
there it's set for non-water soluble
things to put in a little bit of brush a
brush like an actual brush cleaner all

their own brush cleaner

funny hey I'm a rough Dale your kids are
annoying you works fucking a trial 101
outside get the South Roper skinnier get
good and stick random objects on it and
one to roll what was your crime there

count to 10 okay we'll just do 10 what
number one why is there no clean water
and is it the brush into rinse you just
rinse also and you put it on your face
to number two is destroying my brush no
three number three I'm having to clean
my brushes and dirty water every time or
else I would have to do a full new bat
for number four it's not bad in here you
like dunking them all in the Greco under
clamp and brush so you supposed to dump
new watering every time number five
these are impossible to get on and all
the rimming your hands off yeah number
six your brushes aren't even clean in
the water number seven
honestly one at a time yeah so annoying
yeah I literally just want to take this
brush cleaner on a paper towel in
Milan's we're done Oh throw it camera
battery o7 number 7 is 7 yeah we were
8a is rough I've never done eight on our
product before number eight it doesn't
even call a brush cleaner now I've
recommended pouring some in for
non-soluble water stuff which is a lot
of stuff yeah so you do have to use your
own brush cleaner and if you don't have
any you're going to have to go find some
yes nine number nine I mean over time
you're definitely going to loosen up the
glue at the bottom of the brush with
it's spinning the brush like that you're
going to become loose yeah here you're
