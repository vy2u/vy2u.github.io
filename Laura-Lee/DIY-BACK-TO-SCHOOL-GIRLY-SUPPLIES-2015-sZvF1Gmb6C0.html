video we are going to be doing some fun
projects to get you ready for school
because it is coming sooner than later
so hope you're excited for this video
because I am so excited for you guys to
see it I am hopefully enjoy it and let's
get started our first project is going
to be decorating our pencils that way
they are not lame we want original
pencils people okay and that way people
can't hijack your pencils first you're
going to need a little bit of paper tape
with decorations a couple of pencils and
these little flower things I found at
Hobby Lobby they were only $1 a piece so
that was a heck of a deal I just picked
a couple different colorful colors that
I liked to get started we are going to
take the flower straighten out the still
piece and we're just going to fit it to
the top of the pencil no cutting or
anything like that needed guys this one
is so easy and so cute I love it so much
okay and then we're going to match
whatever pattern tape that you want to
do I really like these flowers with the
teal and the flower just thought was
really cute together so we're gonna go
with this I tore off a short piece of
tape and started halfway down the metal
eraser part and I apply the tape kind of
diagonal that way whenever we went down
the pencil the tape wouldn't lay on top
of itself it was more so spreading out
down the pencil if you get what I'm
saying so then I just tore off a bigger
piece and started wrapping it around you
can twirl the pencil or you can twirl
the tape whichever works better the best
thing about using paper tape instead of
regular tape is that it actually
sharpens in your pencil sharpener so you
can keep using your pencil and we are
done with a pencil number
and it is just a cutie patootie I love
it so much I think it's my favorite
purple the second one I couldn't decide
which type to use I went with this arrow
looking tape and this purple flower and
I did the exact same thing over again
just taping the flower to the pimple
this is like easy peasy lemon squeezy
people anybody can do this and it's so
much fun and your pencils are going to
be the cutest and it's a great
conversation starter to make new prints
in school or in college because it gets
awkward okay I know it gets awkward for
our next one I think this one's my
favorite one I don't know I went with
the metallic tape and the hot pink
flower on top and again just twirling
the pencil and the tape right around the
edge and then my cat took over the video
she decided to lay right in from the
camera really oh she really and there
you have it I did three pencils you can
do just as many as you want to and
however you want to do with the design
they're so cute and this is probably my
favorite project I just leveled our next
project we're going to be signing a
little room decor item this is going to
be a pin tough to hold all your sharpies
highlighters pencils and pins first I'm
starting out with this glass little jar
and then you'll need a couple of
stickers and you'll need whatever fabric
you want to use I'm choosing to use
burlap just because I think it's really
cute and lastly you'll need a hot glue
gun I like the hot glue gun because it's
easy and fast first we're going to take
the burlap for whatever fabric you chose
and we're going to measure it around
whatever you can use a
in a glass whatever you want to use to
hold your pins and we're just going to
cut it no measure and tape meet it we're
just going to kind of eyeball it and
then we can trim the excess off later
this for lab was not that easy to cut by
the way guys anyways I'm going to take
the hot glue gun be careful not to burn
yourself I can never use this thing
without burning my fingers off but then
we're just going to apply the glue to
all of the edges of the fabric I went
around the rim of the vase and I ran
around the edges of the burlap next
these little stickers are from the scrap
booking section and they have sticky on
them already but I hot glue them on just
to keep them from falling off so they're
so cute I love these stickers the little
bows just made this and can I get a
thumbs up for cuteness a kitten I feel
like cats are taking over my video I
mean what is this anyways I just applied
them all over randomly all over the
little base or now our pin holder Cup
and yeah that's it I mean it's like 24
the left see you bust at a prison
and the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is creating a section for
yourself to study I used to study in my
bed and I would always fall asleep or
procrastinate watching TV and I think if
you create a really cute area for
yourself to study in you'll want to go
to that area and actually do your
homework so first I like to start off
with this little tray to put all my
supplies in I got this at Hobby Lobby
for seven dollars then fake flowers just
to make it cute this is not mandatory
but I'm telling you it helps with the
cuteness then of course we're going to
put our cute little DIY pin Cup there
and we're going to fill it full of
sharpies I love love love candles or you
can put whatever item that you love I
got that polka dot candle holder for
three dollars at Hobby Lobby and then
the purple one is my favorite sin I'll
have it linked down below and then I
just got this little i´ll because my
name's Laura and I'm just gonna put it
over there and then I just threw all my
cute supplies in the Tri super key next
we are going to create these paper clips
that way you will have the cutest paper
clips in your entire school whether it
be high school middle school
kindergarten college your paper clips
are going to be cute all you're going to
need is stickers tape paper clips very
simple so first what I'm going to do is
take paper clips and then I'm going to
stick this long scrapbooking sticker
through it and I'm going to squeeze it
together and now we have literally a fun
paper clip I love the glitter you don't
have to do glittery items but it's just
me do whatever fits your personality
then I'm going to take a little piece of
ribbon and I'm going to cut it I like to
burn the ends of it that way it doesn't
fray
I'm going to tie the ribbon in a knot
and then I'm going to trim the end off
again because it was a little uneven and
then I burned the ends at one more time
just to make sure they don't fray and
then
we have another cute paper clip next I'm
going to apply stickers these little
circle stickers are from Target
you can then bend that one over or you
can apply another one to the backside
like I'm gonna do here and now you have
a glitter polka dot paperclip polka dot
paperclip that's cute
next I'm going to take a little bit of
that graphic paper tape I'm going to
bend it in half and then I'm going to
trim the end off that way we have a
straight edge and next I just decided to
add a little extra detail I'm going to
just add a little wedge in the end of it
that way it's like a little flag or
something I don't know just thought it
was extra cute and now we have another
adorable paperclip and lastly I got this
little foam heart sticker from the scrap
booking section I'm just going to apply
two back-to-back and there's another
paper clip I know it's just so too and
there we have our adorable decor paper
clips I love these things so much so we
can't forget about notebooks
nobody wants a plain notebook okay so
I'm going to teach you how to decorate
these pretty easy way the first thing
you're going to need for the first
notebook is some spray paint chalkboard
paint you can get this at Home Depot
Walmart anywhere in a composition
notebook and lay it out flat I did this
outside I'm going to be spray-painting
the entire back side of the notebook and
then I'm going to let it dry from 30
minutes to an hour make sure it's very
very dry this stuff dries pretty fast
though I had Tyler spray painting that
was not my manly hand next we're going
to take a little bit of scrapbooking
paper and I'm going to measure the
scrapbooking paper along the edge and
I'm going to just trim it to fit the
notebook your edges don't have to be
perfectly straight just trust me on this
one I know what we're doing well kind of
and yeah this is how I measured to cut
it my edges were super rinky-dinky but
that's okay because we're going to cover
it with tape so applying that to the
notebook I'm going to take a little bit
of my graphic tape and I'm basically
just going to lay it around the border
sticking down the center part if you
want to add a little glue to put the
paper down first that's a good idea
properly I also went applying the tape
left a little hanging off the edge that
way it
to the ends by flopping it over and
basically I just added tape around the
complete and total borders of the
scrapbooking paper and the notebook and
again I left a little flap hanging down
that way it could bend it over and it
would really secure the tape in the
paper to the notebook then I'm going to
be using this chalk paint marker instead
of an actual child just because it wrote
so much better on the notebook and I
just wrote English or you can write your
name whatever subject your crush's name
you know girl do you and then I'm going
to apply a scrapbooking sticker right in
the center and Elle for yours truly
Laura or you can add or draw or do
whatever to the center of the notebook I
think this is super colorful and super
super cute next notebook is legit just
like adding stickers but it's so cute
and it makes it original it makes it you
so first I just get a black notebook
from Target and all these stickers from
Target and I'm gonna apply a big flap
piece of pizza to the center of the
notebook because I love pizza and then
I'm going to stick an amazing sticker
and then I'm just going to add a bunch
of glitter polka dots just to make it
cutie and that's it for this one and
look at our notebooks hello they are
original and they are absolutely
adorable and they are a must-have for
school so if you guys try any of these
