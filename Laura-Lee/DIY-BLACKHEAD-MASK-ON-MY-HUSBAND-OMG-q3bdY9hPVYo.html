oh my eyes were literally open that
combines what did okay I got you bro you
okay Jaime I got you baby don't have
every baby hey guys welcome to my
channel today's video is with a special
gift me torturing my husband a little
bit this is Thai if you haven't seen
them in my snapchat vlog and all over
the internet will then you're missing
out today we are going to be making a
DIY poor mask and I really think it's
gonna work really well because Tai has
large pores large for LA then struggling
was like I get it Laura have large pores
this juggling with blackheads for a long
time so I think we're going to get some
good growth footage it was the hope we
do I'm really been struggling there just
there
well I've been struggling to get rid of
his black ass for a long time oh we're
going to be making video I now are
shaming me right now what you'll need
for this is some charcoal it says it's
activated unless that means if it's
alive or what but it's activated I don't
think that means a live Laura what part
of this would be alive you'll need
school blue in this kind of like
non-toxic so probably yeah it's not
gonna hurt ya it literally says safe and
non-toxic on it so L marks will glue and
you mix it in the bowl and you fly there
anything and you pull it off and trying
to go ahead and jump right in be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
are you a minute Steve :
okay I'm gonna lower the camera first
and let you guys see is mix the mixture
together so you get an idea how to do it
at home no it does smell good
that's a safe non-toxic stuff there's a
choking hazard you don't want to choke
on that means like you don't eat the
bottle I think so luckily we bought the
tablet so like this and we can just pull
them apart and dump the powder in there
we're going to do two of these a lot
harder than I thought it was going to be
I
in my everywhere so then it said about a
tablespoon of glue which is that right
there I'm like my mom with her cocaine
use eyeball stuff makes it together
really well that is looking really good
I feel like about that food cooking
Network right now so this is actually
kind of to be like the perfect
consistency you wanted to be a little
bit soupy what I saw on Pinterest
anyways but not too thick it's going to
be great like I can already feel this
success we're going to have any last
words I'm a little scared I'm gonna take
a cat tongue brush and start painting
this this is already all man I wanted Oh
someone put an even layer how much glue
on my face it's a drying nicely you love
it it's not drying you just plan on I
mean it's applying night gonna be the
most pleasurable thing in the world to
take off
it looks like bubbling shows on this
side do you see that can't be good I
can't be good like for my face for
blackheads are rejecting in the mass it
burns so much yeah I know I'm just
kidding okay you just touch my eyelashes
for real it's part of it I'm just gonna
do like the center of the board like
that what do you think oh look at this
side look out separating why is it doing
this on his skin glue it's not supposed
to be on your skin so now we're going to
let it dry we want to talk about Marley
alright my friend Tyler claims he is dry
freaking Oh baby no I'm scared we're
gonna start with the forehead the nose
is going to be sorry
and now this is definitely going to be
the most fun oh my god I'm so excited
you look so happy
like I have blunt and nails I need you
to get it started with you look let me
see just started yeah yeah I guess I
didn't really hurt so I don't think it's
pulling out things yeah I think it got
down into your pores can you get really
Lord no you poked me in the eye
oh my god I'm so sorry hmm
I don't know if it's like little hairs
it's falling out you think I have hairs
on the middle my forehead I mean we're
man mostly a little peach fuzz
everywhere I like peach fuzz you see the
monitor you see the little white
pricklies on it alright so mommy goes
this way we start this side Real Talk I
kind of like it's just no I don't like
it go bad I feel like I did a really
good job with the mixture because I
picked pulling out little blackheads
mm-hmm do you see like the little
prickly so you can see that nicely
okay the nose is the true test it nose
is a true test so it's got little
farting around with that
oh hi this is better than like it's on
even more oh no I heard a little bit oh
that's a good sign
what's lifting up to you oh yeah good
one there's the pretty hair set pretty
higher oh God
oh yeah me do you guys like my
commentary is it ruining the video oh
yeah
trying to get these blackheads I've done
a million math then you know it may not
be getting all the pores but I've never
seen a mask it's this mini you know the
up is not really doing anything great
hmm
I'm gonna let them take a pinky poo you
seeing that guy do you see all the
little quickly sticking up are those
hairs are those is that peach fuzz
blackheads I think they like it
Oh God look at that see I think that's
blackheads
see how the white that's a lot of dirt
that came out of the face alright so
here is the after guy but it was
handsome devil so there's still some
blackheads but I definitely say that the
mask is just so easy easy and quick to
do them I would say it was just so easy
to do that it's worth it guys try
looking at punishing as well cheek
mm-hmm yes I know that was so much fun
so I think it is good my overall opinion
because I know you guys are wanting my
opinion right now it is I feel like I
did good on the cheeks to the nose
because the nose is so hard like those
pores just dug in there in my nose in
fact it was funny it kind of like kind
of works
we hope you guys enjoyed the video and I
in spicing your face for anything else
weird that I see we hope you guys
enjoyed the video thank you guys so much
