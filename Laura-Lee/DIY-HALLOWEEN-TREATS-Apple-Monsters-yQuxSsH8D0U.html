alone time
hello it's Brenda
happy all the way today we're going to
be creating aqua monsters in partnership
with besan yes and on my channel we
created green mac-and-cheese my
flavorant we have things she does that
on purpose we have seen so many
youtubers we playing these best things
guys so we decided to download ourselves
and give it a little try best mates is a
free puzzle adventure games where you
collected a great character by matching
the same color object to defeat the
slugs not surely what level are you on
I'm all the way on level 31 I went that
say whatever you owned a little past 70
73 my god Brenda's oh oh you do these
days but at games if you're really great
at best things like me better than
Shirley but you should definitely check
out the second game best fiends forever
it's super fun and crazy crazy and this
Halloween the game has cute little slugs
with costumes and daily challenges with
huge rewards huge I mean huge rewards
that's right we're going to be making
Apple monsters to look like Quincy from
the game and for today's Apple monsters
you're gonna need a little bit jiffy
peanut butter apples ice these
strawberries and hearkening pop Pocky
that's a HD Live these are
chocolate-covered cream biscuit sticks
variation July how did biscuits get in
my recipe I said no biscuits no butter
and no cheese and somehow biscuits is in
my recipe they're popular low-fat only
300 aboard of calories per starving
Brenda ate Apple I love Pocky Brenda is
gonna go ahead and slice this Apple
right in half mmm slice in half one more
time and now a kid-friendly step we're
just gonna carve out little mouths right
in the center that's get in there oh
Jesus we under the Apple for Jane surely
not one is blended apples crooked just
like Laura Lee that horrible voice at
hers everybody keeps talking about once
you had the spoon dug in there you're
gonna scoop out the mouth to reveal the
that took her 40 tries it did not turn
out like that the first time
don't let her feed that to you I said
for the teeth we're gonna take three
honking seats and put them inside the
apple and shove a man you can create
them crooked like Laura Lee or straight
like Patrick Starr and we're just gonna
take the peanut butter and shove it in a
mouth hmm you're nasty we're gonna take
this and just fill up the mouth not too
much this one's got a little janky taste
it's hanging off I mean Dartmouth that
teeth don't fall out just like Laura's
not for the tongue we're gonna take some
strawberries that we cut until little
Eddy pieces and put it in for the tongue
and lastly since this is a baby Quincy
we're just gonna add one eye on this one
but now when you're playing the game and
the higher up you go Quincy grows and he
gets a lot more eyes and looks a little
more scary oh look how cute he is
looks just like Charlene your teeth do
resemble pumpkin seeds to me that's what
it was you spit in my mouth yeah punky
see puppy next we're gonna take our
pockys and we just cut the little end
off of them right here we're just gonna
come in his head for it but you don't
wanna waste it and cut it with a knife
you can just nibble the am I'm a that
what's gonna happen just drill it in a
shuttle suckers head just know in the
back in the back in the back not that
right in the head the back of the head
