Charlotte show today we are gonna be
doing it yummy
Halloween tree and I love these
Halloween is the time for having fun
playing dress-up trick and treat in and
we brought to you today some mummy
recipes on my channel we did some mummy
hot dogs and today we're gonna be making
out my channel mummy shall laughing
those poppers I think are gonna be
popping like I was in the club last
night let's get started
be sure to subscribe to our Channel and
follow us on Twitter I have more
followers
a man is next but that's not in that is
nasty surely we're popular so here are a
few ingredients you will need to make
the jalapa nose love how fires jalapeno
is how you pronounce ur jalapenos you
show your gesture knows he should get
for our first ingredient you will need
the gelatinous Oh Pena some scallions
also known as green onions onions some
little candy eyeballs candy eyes some
creme J's cream cheese so jet change ah
cheese eggs eggs and some crescent rolls
preferably Pillsbury Pillsbury so the
first thing you want to do here is
pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees not
how to degrees pretty that was your cue
go pre huh thank you very much next what
you want to do is get your crescent
rolls out and you are just gonna get
them out on the pan we had a little
issue earlier with opening these and now
they're coming they're coming
you mean like we said we're gonna roll
this out on our own roll it out look
like a dick and it is so calmly gonna
cut these into nice little strips for me
and we had a little incident with the
Jalapa nose earlier and we had these
prints for us due to that incident for
the child that couldn't handle the
peppers they invited my calf and Lord
Rena you are rolling
earthworms over there actually is much
easier you to cut my strips yeah I can
listen to me because you're stupid oh
they're in my death where did this come
from ran their way now what we're going
to do is start mixing our ingredients in
we're gonna add a little bit of the jack
shredded cheddar cheese so I'm gonna add
a little ginger scallion and then just
harvest is I know this can remix it like
a big ocean get in there get in there
use that elbow grease and now for the
best part we're gonna start stuffing our
Jalapa days poppers you want to just
take a easy portion is just pour it in
like so and by the way you not want to
overstep them because we got to decorate
them with the mummies in the eyes if you
would have given me one split second I
could have told our audience that but
you just couldn't do that so what I'm
going to do next is take it to eggs is
there two large eggs and I'm going to
mix them up in this bowl right here
you want to make sure and get a lot of
shell in your egg you're going to do
this part to coat the help hang yes
we're that way our money let me have a
nice egg wash finish that is what you
called a mixed egg so next up on this
beautiful jalapeno journey we're gonna
start wrapping a mummy fine or jalapeno
this is so much fun y'all can do it just
make sure to leave some room for the
eyes and the feet and you can just have
fun and rappy any with your way that you
would like to now might be afraid of
your brain is gonna get where I a head
and Reynolds Wrap this try bring to be
that's right that's right don't do a
baby care
or maybe for me I'm gonna line this your
quick action spray the pan like so and
we're going to line these on the tray
and we're gonna bake them for how long
400 for how long I could ten minutes but
first don't forget to add a little bit
of that egg wash that way you get a nice
shiny finish
unlike Brenda's laners my winners came
out gorgeous if you want to check it out

or if you just stay here and keep
watching alright so here is the finished
look next we're going to add a couple
these cute little eyes that we picked up
at Michael's these are edible eyes are
so darn cute to make an cross-eyed
straight out for I have three eyed eye
