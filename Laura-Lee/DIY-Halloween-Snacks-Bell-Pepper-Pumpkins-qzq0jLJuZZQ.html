easy well if you would have just given
me a split hair of a second I could let
you know we're gonna start with the
ingredients that you will need for the
bell pepper pumpkins first you're gonna
need two big old pieces of chicken
chicken bell peppers preferably orange
ones because they are pumpkins taste
ricochets of your likens Brynn if you
could just hold off I'm hungry and you
will need Uncle Ben's rice and Uncle Ben
is a good-looking fella you'll also need
some chili peppers and diced tomatoes as
well as some black beans that will cause
Brenda the bullets anyways for the
spices ready for pepper corn garlic salt
cumin cayenne some chili powder chili
powder so last night we took out our
crack pot and we're gonna pepper that's
a crock pot I'm crazy Craig crock is the
same thing it's far from the same that's
all those shoes
drop crocs are the shoes your right to
crack pot cracker to bust your crackpot
don't you drink peas do crack and break
your mama's back so in the crock pot
you're gonna want to add chicken to the
bottom of the slow cooker and you're
gonna sprinkle it with a seasonings
once he spoon of cumin 1 teaspoon of
garlic salt 1 tasting of chili powder
half a teaspoon of black pepper and then
you're gonna add it with a decimate oh
and Grange Hill a just bring home right
huh after you're gonna top it off and
cook it on low for six to eight out or
half a four to six hours if you want a
little bit faster and when you're done
shred the chicken and allowed to remain
in the sauce get out of my kitchen who
are you he's a producer we hired ham
this woman is in here Rachel hi yes so
get her on a preheat the oven at 350 for
the peppers work in a bank and once your
chicken is done cooking the next day
preferably you want to go ahead and
shred it you're gonna want to shred a
lot so and make sure it's well compared
it it smells actually real delicious
crock pots are so easy to do do the knot
before
set it and ah okay got your way like I
said you can shred the chicken and you
can set it and forget it
yes that's right Charlotte we love this
compote which is bad what's great about
this original slow cooker in fact you
can set it on high for 4-6 hours or low
for 8 to 10 that great delicious recipe
you can find our recipes on nasty
Shirley and nasty bring them so what you
want to do first is get your little
pumpkins you'll just cut the top off
with an exacto knife and remember to
have an adult at a and that's what I'm
here for just cut that top right off
Brenda that's what you want to do is go
ahead and cut the little seeds off the
top just as Brenda's doing and go ahead
and clean out those inside they are just
stuff Oh so as we do the pace we're
gonna want to do it with an exacto mouth
it looks like a is we're gonna go ahead
and cut out this cute pumpkin face so
we're just gonna go to town and just
stem these little eyeballs right on out
just cut them out you don't even have to
be neat with her I guarantee it'll turn
out perfect every time and as she's
doing that ugly snaggletooth face of a
pumpkin I've set aside some boiling
water so right after we do this we're
gonna set them aside to something and
just like that every time you have the
cutest plum little pumpkin any birdie
and this is what you should end up with
is some cute snaggletooth face pumpkins
mine was inspired by her niece Laura Lee
yes not
did nail alright Brandon it's a pumpkin
in my hair you want to blow this on the
store for fat gentleman on the stairs
secure it on over there play thank you
don't swing have them here all day I got
in here all night
this club I'm swinging off I'm sad to
say so while the peppers are boiling we
have enough time to mix arrest the
ingredients for the crop crop hop first
we're gonna go ahead and add that foot
rest then we're gonna add some veins and
next the best part is shredded cheese
get that cheese in there mmm my move
that's right so we should do a tie steak
let me feed you keep me eating it all
now well mmm delicious as I thought that
is very good by the way
now that our food is ready we have our
crock pot mix as well as our pumpkin
peppers mm-hmm and she's gonna take out
a simple baking sheet loud with Reynolds
foil and we're gonna place the pumpkin
peppers they're not real pumpkins y'all
don't get them confused we're just gonna
place these soft suckers onto a dish and
we're gonna stuff them ever so gently
for added yumminess Brenda loves extra
cheese I love cheese and you're gonna
bake your little pumpkin peppers 350 for
30 minutes that's 30 minutes y'all or
until they're nice and tender or 30
minutes or not and how 30 minute
