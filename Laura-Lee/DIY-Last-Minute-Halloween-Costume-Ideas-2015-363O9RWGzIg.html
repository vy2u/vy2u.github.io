a whole bunch of really really quick and
easy peasy lemon squeezy Halloween
costumes these are for those last-minute
moments where you get invited to
something you're like I ain't gettin
nothing to wear how much I can help you
out you know wait for you guys to see
this video we're gonna jump right in and
get started
subscribe before you leave who our first
Halloween soil we are gonna be turning
ourselves into a big toy secret bag
which you'll be needing is a Victoria's
Secret bag you will not eat a cat by the
way she's just hanging out there some
scissors some tape some tool and lastly
a boa yeah yeah to start off we are
gonna cut the front half of the bag off
I try to cut straight lines as possible
but it makes that big of a deal
basically you really just want your
bottom line right that I'm cutting right
now to be as straight that's possible
it should look something like this next
I'm just going to cut the bottom of the
bag off leaving this side and the other
half of the bag attached to each other
and I'm going to flatten it out and it
should look something like this so now
what we're going to have to do is we're
going to tape the bag together I'm only
gonna tape it one half of the bag
together not both sides because we're
gonna have to measure it around us to
make sure it is fitted and we'll stay on
to our body
I do recommend taping both sides of the
bag that way it has a smooth finish and
it won't be uncomfortable to wear so now
I'm just gonna wrap it around me I do
have a shirt on I recommend doing this
without a shirt on but for the video
sake I kept my shirt on and I just
measured how tight to keep it now I
didn't cut exactly with the line until
it overlaps a little bit that way
whenever we fold it back up like this I
will be able to have room to tape it
together and it won't be like right at
the seam so then I'm just pointing it to
tape this together it's a little bit
easier if you have someone holding the
bag but I'm on my own on this one so I
had a little bit of trouble but I got it
taped together and again I do recommend
taping all the way around and through
the inside of bag that way it's super
secure and comfortable to wear then I'm
going to cut the ribbon in the front of
the bag and half and make a cute bow out
of it this is just for decoration it's
not mandatory to make the costume and my
cats keep walking by bumping the camera
making it shake
hashtag no respect next I'm gonna take a
piece of that tulle and I am would to
wrapped around my waist and basically
I'm just gonna make this pretty much
fitted and tie it in a knot we're gonna
start making the two tubes then I'm
going to cut pieces of tulle about a
foot long maybe just a little bit longer
and I cut a whole bunch of pieces using
the whole entire roll little pieces
about a foot long and I just keep doing
that now we are going to loop them
around making the to do so I fold the
pieces in half making a loop then I pull
it through our little waistband
well it's height and I just literally
keep doing this over and over and over
until we have a tutu I take all the
pieces that I cut there are about a foot
long and doing this process and it kind
of takes a little bit of time to do this
part but it turns out so super cute so
this is a little bit extra if you want
the costume extra cute I'm going to take
the tissue paper that you'll get
Victoria's Secret bags and I'm going to
tuck it into my bra making it look like
something about bags you can tape it to
the bag actually to the bag that way it
won't come loose throughout the night
and then I did pair it with a pair of it
to a cigarette
pajama pants and there's the bell up
next we're going to be a copycat I
thought this was such a cute idea and I
talked about how easy that's gonna be it
literally will take you 5 min so just
come up with some black clothing some
cat ears some letters and a little bit
of eyeliner so I'm going to take this is
scrapbooking stickers by the way I got
about Hobby Lobby and I'm just gonna
stick on it copy it to a black tank top
then I'm just gonna draw some dots on
the upper lip and I'm going to draw some
whiskers you can get as fancy as you
want to making yourself a cat there's a
whole bunch of cool tutorials I didn't
want about a year ago I don't recommend
watching because it's so old
but um yeah just turn yourself into the
cat and then I'm just gonna add a little
bit on the nose and I ended up making it
a heart cuz I want it to look super
cutie patootie and we are a copycat like
how easy was this one is such a cute
creative original costume DIY baby
we are gonna turn ourselves into a
flamingo that's right people
allow me to go so what you're gonna need
is a pink outfit teacher peach short
speech you whatever you got on hand and
Boas lotsa Boas remember that too - we
made earlier you'll probably need that -
and a piece of black paper to make a
beak so first we're gonna put on our
pink outfit as well as the tutu
then we are gonna put a bow around our
neck and then we'll put another boa in
another one and another one and another
one until we have lots of it we're gonna
take a piece of tulle tie it around our
waist that way the bow is stay attached
we are going to cut a black long
triangle out up some paper and we're to
tape it turnes after using medical tape
that way it doesn't irritate your skin
and last minute I put my hair in this
wonky fun don't wait animals are bird I
don't know and voila your flamingo like
this took a total of five minutes DIY
Halloween thanks we're gonna turn
ourselves into Regina George Ming girl
style best movie ever
you'll will need some scissors a tank
top a cooker bra and if you don't have
on here you'll need some blonde hair
first things first put on your bra and
take top and then cut holes in them and
stretch them out and another home
stretch it out
and put your wig on and maybe even a
skirt and some heels and your Regina
doors like how easy is this so cute ok
next we're gonna be Damien for Mean
Girls which he's my favorite character
hands down so you'll need something to
write with a piece of paper a blue
jacket and some sunglasses first I took
a white bog she didn't take a piece of
paper and just write eat it she doesn't
even go here on it I mean just to make
people understand who you are
