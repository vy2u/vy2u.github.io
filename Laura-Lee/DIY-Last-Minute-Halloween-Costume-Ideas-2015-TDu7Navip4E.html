I know Kylie Jenner was all the rage
this year especially with her blue hair
so why not be Kylie Jenner for Halloween
really all you need is overdrawn lips
and blue hair but I'll run you through a
really quick little makeup Victoria
first I'll fill in my eyebrows pretty
much as usual Piscotty always has her
eyebrows filled in and then I'm gonna
pop on some primer and a little bit of
foundation this is what I do every day
so yeah
next I'm gonna add a little bit of
eyeshadow from the lorac mega pro 2 just
using a matte Brown shadow in the crease
and then I'm going to blend that in and
with my finger I'm gonna pop a little
bit of gold on the lid Coleen only has
some sort of shimmery color on her lid
so that's where I'm going with this and
then I'm gonna put a little bit of
darker Brown in that outer V area and
not taking it very seriously because
again this is more of a Halloween
costume so I'm not gonna wing it out I'm
just gonna define the eyes with a little
bit of black liner from NYC liquid liner
and then I'm gonna pop on a little bit
of mascara Kylee always has on false
lashes so I am gonna add false lashes
and if you don't wear them regularly you
should take the opportunity to wear them
for Halloween because it can be so much
fun so much fun these are gorgeous ones
my house of lashes next I'm gonna
highlight and contour my face because
Kylie always has her face highlighter
and contour so I'm just gonna blend that
out this is a Mac Pro Longwear concealer
and NC 30 and then I am going to use my
setting powder to set this that way it
lasts all night long and doesn't look
crazy and crazy and then I went in with
my Bobbi Brown Foundation stick and just
added a little bit of a foundation
darker than my actual skin and blended
it out for contour you can just use a
little bit of bronzer if you don't want
to get all fancy smancy and then I'm
gonna add a little bit of champagne pop
by Becca cosmetics to give us that glow
okay this is the important part so I'm
using the Sigma lipliner and a pretty
pink color which is pretty similar to
Kylie's lips I'm going to cartoony
overdraw like way of a draw Who am I
kidding where my lips like this every
day just kidding I mean I kind of do and
I kind of don't then I'm gonna go in
with serenity at by Jairaj she has been
caught actually wearing this exact color
so why not wait for the cereal oh yeah
yeah girl those are some lips now so
these are like Kylie Jenner staple lips
on a pop on a little bit of mascara to
my lower lashes because I've kind of
forgot too while I was doing that and
I'll put on a blue wig you can also put
a cap on because she does wear the
backwards cap in the blue wig and that's
Kylie Jenner
moving right along we're gonna do a
super girly fairy princess dear it's
gonna be super cute and super easy I
promise so first we're gonna grab a
little bit of white concealer you can
use a white face paint if you have that
on hand and I'm going to blend this
around the bottom half of my face I'm
also gonna do a couple dance moves and
then I'm gonna grab a shade a little bit
closer to my skin tone maybe a little
bit darker than my skin tone and I'm
going to blend this around the cheeks
across the nose I'm also gonna get the
eyelids with this as well as well as
like the unibrow area too then I'm going
to take the top of the forehead a little
bit that is left and put a little bit of
white and I'm just like patting this on
to make sure it's nice and blended and
kind of gradient next because all this
is pretty heavy and greasy I'm going to
blend it out using this morphe contour
palette then I will take the Pinker
shade and run it across the cheeks just
to give us a little bit of a pinky girly
glow next I'm going in with Sigma's new
gorgeous blush and I'm gonna pack this
on to the cheek areas a little bit on
the forehead and this is really what's
gonna make it a little a that cute
little girly deer oh I love this costume
I think this is my favorite one so
anyway it's just like I said just
packing it on give it a little bit on
the forehead to give us a bit of a flush
next I'll go in with this color pop
white eyeliner and I'm just gonna pick
it up all over my face I'm gonna do a
little bit on the forehead across the
cheeks the nose like a little baby deer
so then I'm going to take a little bit
of that concealer cover my eyelids and a
little bit of white eyeshadow to set it
because I want around the eye area to be
white I don't know it just kind of
reminds me of a deer whenever it's white
and I'm just using a white eyeshadow at
the little rock and mega
then I'm going to take the Anastasio dip
brow pomade in dark brown I'm going to
feather up and create furry like
eyebrows and then draw a stripe connect
it from the eyebrow all the way down to
the tip of the nose doing the exact same
thing on the other eye brow and then
drawn a line down to the tip of the nose
next I'm not gonna cover my whole end of
my nose in brown but I'm just gonna
cover kind of the tip area of it to give
a little deer nose and then I did winged
it out just for a cutesy look with the
brown liner rather than a black liner
because I wanted this to be like a
softer pink deer and then I did take a
little bit and draw it out underneath
the eyes just like a line I took these
bottom lashes I flipped them upside down
and I stuck them to my face tracing the
lines and I popped on false lashes as
well and we're a deer next wednesday
addams this has to be the quickest
easiest costume ever and I got the wig a
hot topic for like 19 bucks so what I'm
gonna do is go in with a foundation in
porcelain and it's just way too light
for me I'm kind of giving that wednesday
addams look Wednesday am space wasn't
like stark white it was just like super
pill so that's what I'm going for and
again I'm going in with that color that
palette from morphe and just setting it
next I will take the teeny tiny bit of
matte black eyeshadow and I'm gonna run
it under the eyes to give me that
Wednesday Addams kind of dead look she
did not have glamorous lashes ever so
I'm just gonna pop on a little bit of
mascara to the upper and lower lashes
and I was still looking a little weird
so I decided to do a little bit of liner
across the upper lash line to kind of
define my eyes which think it turned out
fine so Wednesday didn't actually have
black lips but it just reminded me so
much more of her with the black lips so
I added black lips she totally don't
have to do this if you don't want so you
can leave your lips their normal color
but I just feel like it add it to the
look
see that just feels like Wednesday house
so her eyebrows I noticed were a bit
darker than mine so I actually went in
with this Maybelline gel liner and I
darkened up my eyebrows a little bit and
I created her famous widow's pink and
this was actually really hard to get it
even but it happened and then you can
see my hair shooting out the back
because my hair is too long for this wig
but I'm Wednesday and I hope you guys
