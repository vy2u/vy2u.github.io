gonna go um so I actually never read it
takes you know that like I don't oh my
god maybe that's why people love me or
hate me
it's probably the MiGs oh my god that
already takes like if I mess up a word I
just keeps talking and I won't fix it oh
sure
or else I'll um just keep talking like
I'll be like the Bulova oops bulla and I
keep both edits in I major respect I
don't know why I just can't do that I
don't know what it is it it honestly
really bothers me because like I sit
there and we'll film for hours and I'll
get so angry myself cuz I just keep my
perfectionist
yes but I think it's just because I talk
so fast everybody can't not talk fast
and it sucks always thing that I'd like
struggle with then trying to like force
it yeah but you know why it's not just a
camera thing I go marching slow talkers
though same everyone two times and
you're still oh my yeah never I would
never let anyone I'd rather
the foundation same she's a lady she's
home woman she's a woman I don't I feel
like I'm just not the type to like buy
designer clothes like I very rarely
spend money on my something like to say
that and like that's good to save I
don't know okay I'm not much of a busy
person either but I was like I like it
but I don't know I don't care to have it
like I don't spend my time looking at
designer things online hmm I know a lot
of people do and there's nothing wrong
no they're wrong about if you have money
girl you I do
I'm just snatched a girl don't you

snatch me snow so good when I do is
makeup that was $5.99 rhinoplasty yes
you're moving into your house I'm moving

scale one to ten okay here's my thoughts
like I'm like if I created and grew this
channel this big into a better apartment
bitch in a home I'm about to turn it up
mm-hmm
you know love that yes so I'm I'm super
excited like I think I'm gonna create
really great things in the new home yeah
yeah like big plans for the beauty realm
yes well you know how studio life is
talking about this we like I think the
only person who was a good beauty room
is Tati and then I walked into Laura's
room with like yep yep it looks you guys
see it looking beautiful but we walk in
we go it's cuz they always look so messy
there is no way he had to make all of
this but you can see you look pretty you
can't run account is pretty hard I do I
always I have a big forehead I like to
make me forehead yeah I know for hands
to bring it on down I think you getting
this was the busses or so no
realize it's what you do isn't you're
like yeah that was Joe good you know
that man bun I think was the most tragic
yeah like that's are you kidding me
literally that's not the same person the
nose the eyebrows are the Reese lanta
dollars like this are you kidding who is
that
I'm scooped ice in Manny sometimes his
pictures 8180 the only brush I brought
it for la raza less than ever gonna
contour we need this one I want to be
snatched the tiniest pins just most
pinched nose in the world I don't even
know I've never watched you do your nose
I know
so funny sometimes I do my nose contour
harsh to light line it out and then I'll
go back and blend it yeah or sometimes
I'm like bitch she did that too harsh
like obviously I talk openly about face
sitting all the time of editing which I
love my pictures are obviously edited
yeah like I snapchat my real face and
people see my real face it or not
ashamed of it like I just liked it yeah
right
duh absolutely understand that makeup
and contouring is like especially when
it comes to it like a nose contour where
you're literally taking my huge ass nose
to a tiny thin line yeah so people is
like you edit your nose like your noses
so I was like you know it doesn't look
like that anyways what the fuck so
better I'm like girl you can see me
wearing this nose contour like yeah not
hiding at yeah I think we're good I'm
gonna put some powder too definitely
okay yeah I think my strong points
probably eyes oh for sure
Karl we need to go full oh no you're not
I wanna watch you do this Jesus like
this is what it is how you do your nose
oh this is how you snatch it huh oh
never put that much I mean obviously you
know how to do your piece and we're
finished ever done ladies I can't wait
to smash your face I can't wait for you
to
I think the last influencer that I did
there a couple was Tati for her wedding
no way
yeah I don't do people's makeup very
often I get to like I do like friends
but like of course like actually beauty
influenced her I think was Tati which
was a huge honor
yeah she's her freakin wedding it looks
so good I think I saw the video thanks
sister
she's so pretty she's just the most
beautiful one in the world she was not
really hard to make me see your person
it's like breathtaking yeah that really
did not take a lot of work to make her
look good but I mean she already looks
good so it's not take a lot of work to
make her look like she's stunning on
YouTube but if you like ever run into
him person you like yeah yeah you're
like it literally takes you back so I've
already done one eye on James I think it
looks super pretty he is super easy eyes
to do by the way so he cheats they're a
hacker so now I'm gonna show you guys
how I cheat the look by doing the other
eye so I'm gonna take a little bit of
balm dady from the Laurel the cat's
pajamas power mat and I'm going to apply
it I like to start in the outer corner
on him and then I like to blend it in
the crease and because he is like it's
so much space right here and I'm totally
envious uh so I will swing it on out
we're gonna give you a nice and pulled
out look when I do yours yes I'm so
sorry oh my god yes you guys have to go
to a channel and watch it of course I'll
have it linked in the description box
and all that stuff because I'm gonna get
a little bit of cray cray and spice it
the look and make it a little more warm
how often do you actually do other
people's makeup so I used to do it when
I lived at Alabama really often like Y
all the time right so I would actually
make a living and like me some money off
of it mm-hmm I honestly miss doing like
client makeup yeah so much I did yep
that's something no I would not want to
do it was hard not just sounds like
getting screamed although is what it is
just because you're not just doing it
for fun it's like high intensity hmm no
I'm putting kooky you guys know what
kooky is by now she's a little bit of
cranberry cuz it really matches that
Inglot bit man that I put on his eye
over here there's one makeup artist that
I follow on instagram named makeup my
jaw or shot oh yeah
her looks are always so clean and I
think she like only use it's always like
lay way back oh yeah she looks best ever
her makeup is so clean I like her work a
lot but she's like all in gloss stuff he
didn't realize that yeah I was like
Chuck because she always accounts the
craziest penguins or like some eyeshadow
color that I'm carving out his eye right
now with the Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
you guys know I use this all the time
I'm using the morphe for m41
video I think the biggest honor of all
time thank you
so good and like I'm also really young
what a lot of people don't understand
yeah they do what a lot of people are
like oh he's famous he has money so
you're really human yeah I feel like I
just graduated high school last year I
got you early the average high school
student is not someone who usually is
and a spotlight of millions people
watching so I'm learning and growing
obviously and I'm so thankful to to like
be called out for my mistakes but I
literally like the punching box the
internet but you're the punching box
which at this point is okay because I
usually just find some way to profit off
of it and turn it back around it's just
so it's so like I wish the internet
wasn't so negative nobody ever has
anything nice to say hey which is so far
from the truth to now I think about
because like our followers and like my
sisters are always so kind yeah but it
sucks because the negativity always
speak so much louder it always does like
it's always thumbs up to the top it's
always those little catty negative
comments because people like to secretly
like hit that thumbs up on those instead
of like seeing the positivity I feel
like I'm gonna place right now where I'm
really trying to only put up videos that
I enjoy mm-hmm and I really want to be a
powerhouse of use you wouldn't be
uploading it several times a week but
I'm really focusing on figuring out what
I can upload three or five times a week
that's gonna make me happy and like
actually want to do it yes like you and
Jeffery always like kill the review
was like snotty as well always like the
crazy products and the a lot of
different people do like do just luck
but nobody is forever like no internet
or internet fame can always fail there's
no such thing yeah so I'm really trying
to focus on like how I can set myself
apart and do like what I really want to
do well you're very talented and I think
your followers appreciate it thanks
sister
yeah I do make like videos that like
contain both makeup and entertainment
yeah because if I'm wearing makeup it's
either do you most light makeup ever
being just foundation contour highlight
and lashes yeah you'd left or it's
something crazy like huge crazy oven
eclipse on my own so Laura's gonna be so
careful using this Urban Decay cosmetics
Midnight Cowboy glitter liner the first
time large at this lighter and up high a
little bit off open your eye a little uh
your crease is slower but your crease is
down here like honestly like the line
should be like right here I'll put it
right there
I need a blend all right guys I'm gonna
take bond bomb diggity and cray cray and
I'm gonna blend it on the lower lash
line and then I'm gonna connect it right
here on his outer corner and just swoop
it on out the way everything just flows
Marley so far the best ever
okay - I forced my clients to do their
own mascara I did - do you really well
he knows that I would do it and they'd
be like oh yeah awesome like oh and then
you hit the lower lash line with the
concealer and everything is you have
just scrape it off right so now I'm
gonna take so Hollywood this is James
request this is ride or die it is
actually you can see I've loved mine for
so long like it's got some dents in it
but this is the pattern is literally
still in that
why is like gone it's like I don't ever
that's my favorite place to highlight
right now yeah the top of the brow bone
it just gives you a glow and it's like a
more natural like glow like your dewy a
little I like it cause my forehead is so
big and I face this really tall so I
like highlighting right there because it
makes my face look more wide yeah okay
lips what are we thinking I like nudie
that's like my ride-or-die
hairline reduction surgery and like my
job I just want it to be like no stop
walking alone now you're nitpicking
leave it alone well I like every time
I've seen the photo Sophie bring it down
that's why I want a nose job yeah good
nose bump you don't want but I'm so
scared they're gonna fucking at worse
mm-hmm you know what I mean like could
you imagine if I came out worse I would
never forgive myself I'm really together
I'm not opposed to plastic surgery I
think that if someone wants to do
something with their body it's their
body in their choice mm-hmm I'm just
gonna do it myself so I feel like if I
got fucked up I'd be like I don't know
even know what I would do I would never
forgive myself I'd be so mad at myself
for doing it mm-hmm but then if it
turned out good I'd be so proud of
myself for doing it you don't know
what's gonna happen you don't that look
coach so pretty it is good what was that
that was stripped down by Mac and then
the tart
skinny-dip which this is really popular
one for them love that mm-hmm
you notice I didn't put blush on you so
funny cuz normally I'll still put it on
when I do their make it because they
like it but I'll say I'm not doing blush
I'm hell no so now he's gonna give me a
brutally honest reveal
let's do it tell me you can tell me what
you would have done different okay yeah
I like Ashley there's really not much if
anything I don't see probably the brows
mm-hmm our I think Miley's hair part of
the LA
mmm-hmm if it would me I would have
pulled him out a little bit more and
then okay just maybe like like I usually
bring them like down and try to bring
them up as much as possible
up and out okay so if look if anything
just like you'll be like a short
straight broken mm-hmm okay if anything
I feel like the brows but the eyes are
really good so we had a little bit of a
moment with the the glitter liner
getting a little too high but I think it
honestly turned out good yeah it looks
really good I think you did a good job
me it looks really good bronze I'm
concert in the right places it looks
really clean you did a really good job
if anything in the browser still not bad
looks good it looks so good thank you so
much pink was really under a barley
shade hue just one attention attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
