like legit that's a much it looks like a
highlighter girl this is my milk makeup
actually and I've never tried out I
haven't either I've not even seen these
these are so cool Leah the eyeliner - it
kind of smells like a marker should we
start with like what one do eyeshadow
for I think we should show Perry um take
the blue haha take one for the team and
take the bright blue I don't have to
redo my makeup later how do you even
start I don't know I don't know what to
do this one is called what's yours
called it's just a shadow liner see I
think he says an eyeliner eyeshadow yeah
and this is it's called trust fun where
do you see that right there
model DJ a model made a model DJ shine a
liner so weird it's like a legit marker
or something it's almost like a crayon
yeah like I don't I wonder how that
would work like as a liner it's kind of
look at mine oh yeah your guards got
what I'm about to do right here that is
so is that one swipe that's like three
like that's actually good there's no
skin showing from them
what about like where you suppose all
over the live you
no I don't I put like my magnet Pot in
soft ochre um you know we're just gonna
see how it works on a eyelid yes and how
it works on prime girl I'm like freaking
out bad this blue it's not like we're
far aware I don't know if I like the
shape of it
I don't either it's kind of hard to get
on your eyelid right I feel like I'm
gonna break it me to you and I'm about
to roll it up more cuz I can look at my
that's so pretty though it is pretty but
I like low-key like the woman talk Drew
Carey you know how it reminds me oh yeah
pretty woman that's a you try me right
this color is different because like it
looks super light here but like when you
put it on your leg look I wanna get
better in rubbing away a little bit on
camera no it is rubbing away a little
bit like it's not as consistent as this
blue color yeah that blue is lit it is
it looks like a powder on your eye I
like literally patted it out my little
finger like it looks like a powder of
assault in my face you already have I
shadow on I don't know how you would and
every time I rub this it rubs away only
that edgy mm okay I'm missing a finger
now I know you're about to caught me in
the comment section about it you have to
clock me Laura get your nails done no
bracket I think maybe like as a face
highlighter this could work
oh I love with it Rhea tivity they blend
out you guys oh yeah how should we do I
live here
let's do eyeliner you got our serious
share this with you guys no aah
are you guys ready to see the makeup
skills that I don't have this is legit
marker you need to find some what is it
like hype oh that looks so dark is it
dark it's so dark
Wow so it's happening we need to try to
see if like there's a way to use like
hypoallergenic markers or something on
her face yeah I do a marker challenge
weight has I've been done before
no I don't think so I've never seen that
I haven't either I don't know is it too
shiny it's too shiny yeah y'all know I
like matte eyeliner only that's how I am
too
I don't fool this oh my god I just
messed it up oh my god look at that no
no this is so I want to see you make a
good wing with this girl gonna be you
see my high school makeup look I better
be able to yoga wing I was winging it
all the way back is go whoo wing in
every years oh my god this way it
doesn't look bad though girl my wing is
talking I said I look that bad
it could be word feel like if you're not
careful you could do to think of a line
like cuz the end of it it's kind of
thicker is hard doesn't look bad I see
you regret I let you see the tears yeah
but they don't see you're up man I read
it I'm as like a brown tint it does I
thought was the only one like I keep
seeing like a hint of brown in it it's
weird like brown and black isn't it kind
of hard like kind of hard but like not I
don't know if it's coming I know my
shadow oh yeah Mudge but it's definitely
it feels like it's gliding over it and
you have to do it multiple times
look at my hot girl with this blue I
said it pulls the eye right actually
your wings really good so so that's not
very nice whew you didn't do a pity wing
to help me out
it does look bad but it does not slay
the island that's for sure do you see
how looks brown on her I though you guys
can see really good right now
no that was brown on her eye it like has
like a hues of brown to it so that's
kind of interesting
that's like a good wing so she just
shamed me video should we do the lips or
let's do the concealer yeah let's do
concealer we'll say the lips for last I
actually have more color than this I
think well actually this one is light
this one is ooh
fair is there gonna be too light for you
probably I'll put these on yeah okay
have you ever tried there cuz either
never ne-never i swatched it before and
it felt kind of nice um but it comes in
like this little plastic marker tube
thing and it's kind of heavy so I'm
scared to do like the full triangle I
think I'm going to I'm
God now that thing about it I think I
may have tried this before but I don't
remember I have the worst memory ever
like with your thoughts upon it yeah I
didn't like it if I remember correctly
interesting all right it's super creamy
which makes me like super nervous oh
look yeah it's blending out like kind of
easy biggest thing for me is like I
cannot have a concealer that shows pores
and like enhances on my texture which
sometimes cream products can be like
really heavy and do that yeah I think
it's probably easier with a brush no
yeah I think so too just because it's
cream yeah heavy clearly have blue
eyeshadow kind of sorta in it right here
but we're gonna all out like I don't I
don't feel like it covers dark circles
it's just kind of what does I still have
major darkness right here yeah so do I
you can see that circle right there
mm-hmm and it kind of sits on top and
has like like look at how its kind of
crackling on top right here oh yeah oh
yeah it does not look very good oh man
sorry milk yeah I actually love don't
make up like I love the people and all
cooling thing is so good oh that's my
favorite yeah I got that because you
know no way yeah I really really love
that purr under my eyes I think I like
showed it really quick in a video but I
love it it's literally right there
because I use it everyday yeah it's
really nice like a stick you can roll
underneath your eyes and it like sets
feel so good like cools off the bags and
dark circles
oh stop you oh yeah this is how she does
our makeup everything
do you YouTube or not like honestly oh
it looks like moons Manny oh that is
creasing a my eye it's creasing in my
tooth look at that oh and you have
primer down you can see the creases oh
my this just took a turn for the worse
okay go judge on I don't do my makeup
like this every day yeah okay so we
should probably set the concealer bruh I
don't really see now if there's like a
point because if it didn't work out yeah
yeah just sweet there no saving it we
will try out the lip marker maybe this
one will work you'll have to have a lip
liner I like the way I'm thinking uh
optimistic leave and literally like look
at my face right now
we look yeah yeah yeah like kick us off
on YouTube emails us and they're like no
more Omega what the beauty community
votes is my boys so easy oh girl that's
one that's one not terrible
the AH marker tip is a little bit rough
and it kind of scrapes against your lips
you'll see you'll enjoy that in a minute
I see where they were going with it but
I 100% see where they were going with it
that it just yeah ah do you love it or
do you love it like a lip stain kind of
feel I feel like it's like a lip stain
um I'm actually gonna try to give it the
benefit of the doubt because it's just
like literally just putting like ink on
your lips do you feel house like a
little bit hard it was so committed on
your first side and then I went down
from there yeah it's not if you have dry
lips oh yeah cuz I already did
definitely feels like a market like I
had to picture a marker on my lips this
would be exactly that hills like looks
like you drink some kool-aid and then it
is like one just tow it up but when you
put the gloss on top of it it's kind of
pretty oh there's a gloss with it no I
that was my own invention yeah
my lips look like they shrunk they do
they do look at this let's recap the
concealer it didn't work because he
didn't cover anything like go bad if you
have texture on your skin like with my
rosacea that is just it's not it's not
working I don't recommend it I recommend
this is almost heavy though I would say
for like a person who doesn't wear a lot
of makeup but it's ham it could be like
your one make up part like your no
makeup makeup look type of thing exactly
so maybe this was something like that
but if you're all about the full beet or
meat coverage no yeah so then the marker
liner was strange it wasn't terrible it
wasn't terrible I'm not gonna knock this
one that hard it was just hard to get a
wing and it transferred it's really low
okay that actually was kind of bad about
it I actually forgot so it does transfer
if you hold a eyelids yeah then the eye
shadow things are kind of a poop yeah
they definitely creased both of them I
think the matte one worked better than
the shimmer mm-hmm I feel like they fade
the longer they like roll back to your
eyelid that makes sense and it's kind of
a weird so we're very much strange
product and then lastly the lip product
I wouldn't use this it took forever to
apply if you're like on the go you're
going to absolutely I like that this is
not I like the way they're going out
like the inventions and honestly I think
it's really innovative it just didn't
work really for us yeah I kind of have
like higher hugs for those messages I
had like really big expectations and it
was kind of a poop like we just got done
doing the kids to makeup challenge we do
