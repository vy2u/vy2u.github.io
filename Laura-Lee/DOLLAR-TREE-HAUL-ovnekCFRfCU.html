video is going to be a Dollar Tree haul
I am here finally back with a Dollar
Tree haul I decided to be lazy and put
on a t-shirt and like my pajama pants
and flippy floppies and run to the
Dollar Tree this morning to get a
mention unnecessary things that I really
don't need but they're only a dollar so
I buy them anyways you guys have
requested at my meeting grades if you've
requested on my Twitter
you have requested everywhere all across
the internet on all my social form do
please keep doing Dollar Tree hauls so
I'm gonna keep doing them for ya
if you're new to my channel and don't
know back in the day you Pseudolus tree
house all the time and I'm slacked off
on them so you're gon be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
if you aren't subscribed we're gonna
jump right in the video okay guys so it
started I guess like this bag over here
now in these videos this is not just
beauty stuff this is like random random
stuff white Lay's potato chips next I
bought blow pops I've been trying to
stay away from any hard candy and gum
anyone else notice this nails missing
right now I bought these in order to
stay away from hard candy and gum next I
bought a spatula because because
Shirley's been doing a lot of cooking
these days and she needs a new spatula
filling God's name bought me a Dollar
Tree spatula now we all know that Auntie
Shirley only uses the best in this get
out of here Aunt Shirley you were
nothing but selfish you were ungrateful
and selfish woman dollar dollar Tremont
don't talk to me like that I would never
buy you anything again I'll never buy
you anything again and Charlie slow down
next I bought a cat toy I have no idea
my cats are gonna play with this because
my cats like to play with little baby
mice not real ones fake ones I just
bought it because it was a dollar
I brought superglue I don't have a
specific reason why well super glue but
I just feel like I always need superglue
and I don't have it so it'll be better
to have it and don't need it I guess I
think I don't know why I bought it
maybe I should glue this nail on real
quick I'm kidding
I bought some travel toothpaste and
travel toothbrush I bought this set
for and it works because I've been
traveling so much I mean I have been to
Belize Paris New York Las Vegas I'm
gonna be in Miami Alabama I have been
all over the place and it's been like
one month and I haven't been home a
weekend in a long time I need travel
stuff and then I bought some gained oh
they smell so good
um some of the little dryer sheets I
next I bought a beauty product this is
liquid liner and the brush on it looked
really good if that's the brush let's
find out my only fear is that this is
gonna end up being one of those products
that dry shiny the islands dry shiny and
there's nothing wrong with that but for
my personal preference I don't like when
my eyeliner dry shiny I like my black
eyeliners to dry matte the brush looks
really nice and the product seems it
seems okay but it's not applying evenly
I don't know if you can tell from back
here but there's like thinner parts of
it I mean it was a dollar so I can't be
mad at that we're gonna wait and see if
it dries shiny or not have all some
bobby pins because my bobby pins are
forever missing no matter how many times
I buy them
I am always out with in a month I don't
know where they go they run away at
night I guess then I bought two nail
polish products I bought this color
looks really pretty this is my LA Colors
color crazed number 619 these are not
the best nail polishes in the world I'll
tell you that but it looks pretty and I
wanted it so I just bought it and now
I'm really interested to try out this
stuff out it was called super dry and
it's supposed to dry your nail polish
with a high shine really quickly now
this stuff works for a dollar and does
what it says and I'm gonna buy all of it
cuz that's amazing
I bought Sudoku I think that's how you
pronounce it because I've been traveling
so much I really wanted to up my math
thinking skills exercise my brain play a
game that I'm completely not interested
in cuz I'm super
on a plane there's absolutely nothing
else to do in the airplane movies suck I
guess that's why about this guy's this
dried so friggin matte it dried
extremely matte I'm super happy about it
and um yeah that's awesome talking about
from the Dollar Tree that's when I go to
the Dollar Tree it never fills you
actually fills me like 50% of the time
but it's not filling me right now all
right I bought these are my favorite
hair clips and I step on my bright comb
and my cat still them so I bought more
of these and then I bought a hair bun
set I have no idea what to do with this
if you feel like commenting down below
and letting know how to use this device
but it also comes with rubber bands
bobby pins and then this little thing
what is this and what do I do
someone tell me I know someone out there
knows you know leaving a comment develo
don't leave you go Hagen don't leave you
girl moving on to the next bag I bought
this thing Bret Hart surely but we won't
tell her about this for her because
clearly she gets upset about Dollar Tree
stuff it's broken I've all these why did
I buy these us well because I needed new
reading glasses of course I said well I
four pack of steak knives these knives
are not good but I had Dollar Tree
knives from the past and about that are
super not good so I figured I'd replace
them with just not good knives they're
just very flimsy and they don't work
that well but I keep buying them it's
the endless torturous cycle of bad
kitchen knives alright next I bought oh
god I bought me a charlie something else
I've got to stop where is she I bought
her a whisper it looks nice looks really
nice we'll give it to her we won't tell
her it's from the Dollar Tree I bought
these take long Rubbermaid containers I
love these does anyone else use the
actual container part as a bowl like to
eat your ramen noodles out of to fix a
salad out of and not just use them as
storage containers because I knew I do
that Oh
lastly that's it that's so sad guys and
spent 23
dollars $23 see what I did there
lastly I bought Clorox bleach because I
have white sheets and I like to bleach
them but amount of bleach and my bathtub
is gross so I should probably go clean
that with this alright guys so that is
it for the solitary haul I hope you guys
enjoyed it
