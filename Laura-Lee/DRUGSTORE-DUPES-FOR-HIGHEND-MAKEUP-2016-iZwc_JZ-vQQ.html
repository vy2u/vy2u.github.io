video is going to be a very highly
requested video it's going to be another
drugstore dupes video episodes in my
last one I kept getting several comments
requesting for another one so here I am
with that video for you it's always
trying to play games yeah alright I do
want to announce just one more time that
June BB LA is right around the corner it
is the 30th and the 31st of January and
I will have a meet and greet we Shiu at
Gen Beauty around 1 o'clock so I hope to
see you guys there let me know in the
comments if you're going to go because I
can't wait to meet you guys and don't
forget to check out my social media
before you leave the first part we're
going to start with is something I'm
really excited with so the high end
version is going to be the makeup
forever step one utiliser there's like a
crapload of these I want to say there's
like 15 different one of these but the
one that I'm talking about is the
nourishing one it doesn't even say Oh
nourishing primaries it does so this one
is a really nice primer especially if
you have dry skin it just puts that nice
slick base down on your skin and it
nourishes your skin and I feel like you
make sure of how they shouldn't stick to
your skin well I have found a complete
and total dupe which I'm very excited to
share with you and it's the new primer
by Milani I feel like I'm looking at my
lighting and it's a melon all and
there's just like a white tube so I'll
do close-ups but this is the Milani at
prime perfection my opinion that says
the exact same thing it hydrates it
helps minimize pores and it helps that
foundation just to like stick to your
skin and lasts longer bottle sizes don't
really make a difference although you
would think that this one gives you more
but if you actually read on the back of
it it says 12mm and this one says 12m so
you're going to be exact same amount of
primer for your money I look through
this bottle in the lighting and it's a
thin plastic bottle you can see straight
through it so the primer I actually
starts right here in it so the bottle is
bigger but the actual amount of product
you're getting is the exact same but the
Milani is the cheaper option and it is
an awesome primer next what I want to
talk about is the Oleg I don't lineage I
want to call it lineage I make
dang it completely wrong and chances are
I am and I'm okay with that this is not
a TV commercial this is the Laura Lee
channel and we say things crazy on this
channel Laneige BB cushion and it's a
really nice product so basically you you
get the little sponge applicator and
then you flip it over and it's a cushion
dome in there with nice found a nice
foundation and it says it's a BB but
this actually provides quite a bit of
coverage in my opinion and it has a lot
of sunscreen so it's got SB is 50 and
you hear this at Target for around $35
now this is the dupe for it is the
L'Oreal Lumi True Match cushion and now
this one doesn't have any sunscreen in
it so that is the difference between the
two but I will say this one doesn't feel
oversaturated and sunscreen can
sometimes sunscreen can break me out
because it is a heavy product but this
one doesn't have any sunscreen in it so
I just wanna let you know that is a big
difference in the dupes but the actual
product I feel like is the very liquidy
and they do the exact same amount of
coverage and them and they both have a
you know decent range of colors to
choose from this one is around sixteen
seventeen dollars and this one's around
thirty four so this is going to give you
a bang a pull y'all book and the
funniest thing to me is they come with
like legit the exact same sponge I mean
the color of the sponges are different
but they're the exact same sponge so
it's just like the products are so
similar it's incredible and you're gonna
save you Dollaz an evolution I promise a
long time ago I wouldn't reference honey
booboo child on my channel again and I
just did the next dupe I discovered is
by I don't I don't know how to say this
brand pala do hmm is a contour stick is
called the definer and it's a contour
and highlight duo and you can find this
at the drugs in the drugstore section at
Ulta Beauty I will link them down below
because I know this isn't I don't know a
very heart of brand I'll put it that way
and then the dupe for that I have found
is the contour stick this one is sold at
Sephora and it is
I can play in total dupe so actually
these are really nice like pencil sticks
to contour with I like both products
equally I think they're both absolutely
amazing I feel like the drugstore one is
a little bit more of a cool tone color
which works better for me when contour
my face because I don't really like
coming out looking like a pumpkin but
that's just me the other side of it I
will tell you is a little bit different
the golden sugar highlight is is like a
actual highlight your cheekbone not like
a concealer kind of highlight I just
wanna let you know that this one is a
little bit of a lighter color and then
this one's more golden but it's the
exact same concept and it's a ridiculous
price difference in the two products and
I like I said I actually prefer the
contour on the drugstore one so don't
mind if I think both products were
really awesome but he and I have a lot
of money with this one you guys ever
have like an itch on your nose and
you're so scared to scratch it in public
because people are immediately gonna
think you're digging up your nose it's
just an itch next product on the agenda
to talk about is by ciate I know how to
pronounce this one this is the CIPA
London this is their collaboration with
Olivia and this is called sea side apart
I should probably know what it actually
is before I start giving you all that
information it is a blush bronzer duo
and it is gorgeous
very creamy very pigmented I found it
bloob is actually a product that's been
out for a minute by physicians formula
which is an amazing drug so brand visit
the dupe is seriously it's the most
amazing dupe because the thing is this
is very creamy this is very pigmented
and then this one has sunscreen in it
where this one doesn't so this one's
going to protect your skin a little bit
more and you're paying less for that
quite right I know I love both products
I will have to tell you that I think
they're absolutely amazing both of them
at the end of the day the actual product
is pretty much identical especially with
the formula in them they
amazing of both of them save yourself
some dollars and get the BB one by
Physicians Formula
I just want more think about these I
love traveling with these because you
get your bronzer and blush and it's just
one less item you have to pack whenever
you pack a duo the next product that is
a total dude this is the dermablend
professional setting powder and I think
this is a pretty popular setting powder
out in the market it's like floating in
the air and giving up my nostrils and
this is a very nice setting powder I
will let you know whenever you get into
these like white translucent powdery
things they will flash back on a camera
if you're just wearing it out you're not
really planning on taking a bunch of
pictures with a flash you don't really
have to worry about it they're great for
setting your makeup it locks your makeup
in it makes it last and look flawless
and you don't have to worry about
anything sloughing off or moving around
and it's pretty much invisible unless
that flash comes about enough about this
I found a dupe and it's actually a new
product it's called the master fix by
Maybelline so it's their translucent
powder and I tested out the both of them
and I absolutely cannot tell one bit of
a difference so I would definitely say
my money and up for the Maybelline
master fix it by face studio this is yea
the exact same thing I mean it's
ridiculous myolie skin friends out there
this will help set your makeup and keep
it matte instead of that shine if you
don't like the shine you know what I'm
saying you do get a lot more product
than you do in this I mean this is like
enough to last you a year and then this
I don't know this was still asking me a
really long time I still think this is
worth buying the cheaper option in this
case okay AB two more products and they
are lip products which who doesn't love
them first one is the Bank Binney bomb
and I think that these are absolutely
amazing for school or work to pop these
in your book bag or your purse to wear
to school work and I say that because
lipsticks are so high maintenance
especially a liquid lipstick you have to
worry if it's on your teeth you have to
worry if you eat are you like missing
the center of your lipstick or a liquid
lipstick is it crusty is it cracking is
it smeared out of line you can't make
out what your boyfriend because
everybody will know they're just so much
work these are great because they're
like a glossy chapstick that hydrates
your lips
a little bit of tint but this is that
Branigan that I can't pronounce very
well that's at the drugstore section how
old ah you know what I'm talking about
this is the butter me up sheer color
bomb and it's the exact same product
ridiculous how similar these two are and
you can definitely save a lot of your
money that with this and these are
vitamin infused so this is little ish
Asst in my research laboratory I
actually found a second one that has a
doob no I don't have a laboratory but I
like to pretend like I do and then this
one is cha-cha mom now cha-cha bombs
Dube is sherbert sherbert sherbert
sherbert is a nice peachy color it's
really pretty
bang-bang actually I have another dupe
I'm gonna share with you that wasn't the
last one
does it ever scare you whenever people
have claws and they talk with their
hands a lot so you feel like they're
like you're like trying to dodge it as
they talk to use it you don't lose an
eye next dupe is from this Oprah
cosmetics this is the blush bronzer
luminizing blush stripes there's a whole
lot of words on the back of this package
so it's either illuminizer bronzer or
blush and blush stripes this is the
product this is an awesome product from
Oprah is a gorgeous product and you can
either kind of swig 'el your brush in
them and get the colors individual or
mix it all together I think it makes a
beautiful blush topper mostly unless I
dabble my finger in this gold color
right here because I really like that
gold color mm-hmm that's pretty do port
is actually about wet and wild now this
cost $4.99 and this is catwalk pink this
is so illuminating palette and it
basically has the exact same colors in
it seriously obviously you see the size
difference is ridiculous
I like both a lot I think they're both
pretty creamy products I actually fell
in love with this wet and want one just
because it was $4.99 and I stitch
swatches on the back of my hands with it
with a makeup brush from when wild and
it was just crazy what I got out of it
for $4.99 I thought it was such a great
deal if I find out online I'll link it
down below because I highly recommend
this and it's a total dupe for the blush
stripes bio for cosmetics which is also
like I said a beautiful product this is
just a lot cheaper that is it for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it please
give her as much
if you did enjoy and I hope to see you
all in my next video
