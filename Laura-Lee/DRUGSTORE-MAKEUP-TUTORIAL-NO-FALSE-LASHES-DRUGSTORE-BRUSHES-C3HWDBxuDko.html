today's video is going to be a date
night makeup tutorial all drugstore I'm
actually using all Revlon products and I
even using all affordable makeup brushes
in this look which is much requested for
me on my channel so I hope you guys
enjoy that part of the video for today's
look I went with very soft neutral eyes
it's almost like a soft cut crease and
then for the first time I think ever on
my channel I did like a light brown
eyeliner instead of like a dark bold
black liner for my lip I'm using the new
love is on lipstick from Revlon this is
a beautiful universally flattering red
color
it smells oh I just got out of my nose
oh it smells so good it smells very
fruity the packaging has I attract love
in six different languages going across
it and so I went with this look with the
neutral eyes and the bold red lip as
more of a confidence booster I feel like
whenever you wear a red lip it inspires
confidence it just really gives you that
like yes girl I'm in the room hey and
you definitely want to be confident and
just you know feel outgoing so powerful
whenever you're on a day confidence is
key so that definitely inspired the date
night drugstore makeup tutorial for you
may be showing you subscribe to my
channel for more tutorials let's get
started now jumping right in this video
we're going to get started I'm gonna
start out with a Revlon Photoready this
is the perfecting primer and I apply
this all over my face to prep my skin
for my foundation then I'm going to go
ahead and go in with this Revlon
Colorstay foundation I am in shade 310
I'm just going to buff that all around
my skin this is a great foundation for a
combination to oily skin and it has nice
medium coverage to it so it's not too
heavy next for concealer I'm going to be
using the Revlon Colorstay I always like
my concealer to be one to two shades
lighter than my foundation so that way
not only is it there for coverage but
it's also going to highlight our face in
particular areas then I'm going to blend
that out I kind of like to stipple the
product out that way it gives you an
airbrushed finish and you won't have
brushstrokes in
you're concealed I went ahead and set
that concealer next I'm going to be used
to Revlon Photoready
facial powder and I use this as a
bronzer because I'm using a deeper shade
I'm just going to bronze up under the
cheekbones around the temple area just
where the sunlight would naturally hit
the face and I bring it on around for my
eyes I'm going to be taking not just
nudes palette from Revlon take this
little topi shade and I'm going to blend
it right into the crease as our
transition shade then I'm going to go in
with the warmer dark brown color and
I'll blend that right into the crease
with a fluffy blending brush we're going
to kind of create a very very very soft
cut crease for it this book I'm going to
then take the lighter shimmery shades
and start packing them on the lid this
look is super easy simple will take you
like five minutes to complete just
remember I like to pack the colors on
the lid that way they don't dispersed
everywhere rather than blending them on
the lid next I'm going to take the map
dark brown color and an angled brush I'm
going to create a winged liner with eye
shadow this was really easy and you
don't have to be so precise because you
can smoke it out a little bit it defines
the eyes but it's not too heavy because
it's not black liner then I'm going to
take the Revlon this is the length and
volume mascara and apply it to my lashes
no falsies involved and I use the Revlon
highlighting palette I take the deeper
shades at the bottom of it with a brush
and apply it as a blush to my face I
love peachy blushes they are my favorite
and then I take the shades above it and
use it as a highlight it is a beautiful
highlight shade then lastly I'm going to
be taking this super luxurious love is
on lipstick the red shape from Revlon I
think this lip color looks good on all
skin tones it's very luxurious filling
and moisturizing to the lips and not
only do you look good wearing this red
lip but you also feel good and confident
and beautiful wearing it and here is a
little before-and-after of you wearing
it just so you can see how much the
color really makes the look pop I love
