channel today's video is very exciting
because I'm gonna be trying out the new
makeup revolution concealer which has
been very highly rumored to be a
complete do for the infamous
heart-shaped tape concealer which is
quite the price difference now I
recently picked this up at also calm
they did not have it in store I try to
buy and store and they didn't have it
hey what are they online and I'm super
excited I think that you hey got this
first because makeup revolution is a UK
brand and now we have it online I want
to be testing them out I'm going to do
Tarte on this side of my face and then
makeup revolution on this side of my
face putting on my concealer like I
normally would blending it out wearing
it and doing a wear test throughout the
day testing coverage wearability
creasing all that jazz I'm gonna set it
the exact same we're gonna see if we
truly have a dupe I think we've been
looking for a dupe for the Tarte shape
tape forever in a day like a true really
amazing full coverage long-lasting
creaseless do cuz girl I know everybody
and their mom loves the Tarte shape tape
I think it's so great someone doesn't
even love it so maybe we have finally
something that is a lot lower in cost so
without further ado I'm gonna sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and then we'll go ahead
and jump right into the video be sure
and now let's go ahead and jump right in
okay getting started I bought they have
a bunch of shades of the make a
revolution one I bought c-2 and c-3 it
says conceal and assign is a full
coverage concealer and contour so I did
buy a deeper one I don't think I'll use
because it looks a little way too warm
it looks a little way to one it looks
way too warm for my school I can't speak
today it looks too warm for my skin tone
and this is c-13 gonna work out but
that's okay
I just bought it for shits and giggles
so today I'm going to be testing these
out against the Tarte which I forgot to
get so now I gotta get up and get the
Tarte because I ain't got it together
today okay I got it
so this is the Tarte shape tape it says
that this one is 3.4 ml and it says this
one is net 10 ml so I'm assuming you get
a bit more product in the Tarte so now
that you know that you're getting more
product in the Tarte we're still gonna
test out the quality and the
money-saving do penis first I want to
swatch shades in the Tarte I always use
light natural I think yeah like natural
I'm like wait the right girl online
again these shades were really hard - oh
my god look it's like the same doe foot
applicator OOP this one's a little bit
lighter we're a little bit hard to pick
out because the picture of the shades
were a little weird I think I'm gonna
use c3 is really pink c2 is really
neutral yellow so I'm gonna use c2 and
then the Tarte one and now but first of
course I need to drop the Tarte I'm
gonna apply it some foundation oh my
gosh it just dropped the makeup
revolution see this makeups trying me
today I'm going it to add some
foundation I'm gonna be just putting on
the NARS foundation today go ahead and
if you'll notice I'm gonna kind of avoid
the under-eye area
applying foundation and just really
focus it in my the rest of my face
foundation is on it is time to do the
concealer
have you all seemed in with me first I'm
gonna go ahead and apply the Tarte one
now the thing is about this Tarte one
can you see how thick cake that is I
don't apply it in a full triangle on my
face because it's just way too much
makeup because it blends out so far so
just highlight that half of my face and
now I'm going to take this c2 maybe a
close up of the bottle and I want to
give you a close-up of the applicator do
you feel similar that is so oh girl this
is this is kind of thick looking
I'm gonna take a clean y6 brush to blend
out the tart side I'm gonna show you do
you see how like far that little bit
goes and I like to stipple it in because
you really get an airbrush finish and
that way you don't get the brushstrokes
in the end I might swipe a few times but
for the most part you'll get a really
nice flawless finish
now the Tarte one is great it has like
such great coverage and I really enjoy
that about it and I'll take another
clean y six brush because you know
Mama's got these brushes for days and
let's see our thoughts so it feels
really thick blending out lots of
coverage it is gonna be a little bit
lighter over here because the color of
the product was lighter cover my zit I
will say right off the bat that this
concealer did blend out really nice if
you guys can see it just looks super
smooth and flawless it also kind of
feels like the Tarte shaped tape as far
as the weight of it and the coverage was
very full so first off we're right on
track with like it being a dupe I'm
gonna go ahead and set it with some
loose powder and see what else happens
throughout the day here is my powder and
I'm just gonna set them both you can
look up and really get the under eye so
doesn't crease now that I feel like I'm
done baking I'm now gonna take a white
11 brush I'm just gonna sweep away any
excess powder and I think well I know
this side looks good cuz it's the Tarte
shaped a foot see so what do you guys
think Lee can you tell a difference I
honestly like right off the bat I feel
like I have the same amount of coverage
and it looks super similar on my face so
exciting stuff I'm gonna go ahead and
add a little bit of bronzer and then
see the tea Oh we'll have to see the tea
a little later because we don't know her
okay
I add it on the rest of my makeup
literally I feel the same about it I
feel like my under eye looks the exact
same
I'm so let's wear a couple hours of the
day I gotta clean and start packing for
a trip and like do a bunch of stuff
which would cause me moving around and
work in and we're gonna see how it holds
up we're gonna see how it wears I'm
really gonna see if this is truly a dupe
or a flippity-flop
let's see I'll see you guys in a few
hours what is up guys is my first
check-in time in wearing this for like
three hours and there is absolutely no
difference in it concealers come on get
in focus I really want you guys to see
there we go
it looks the exact same it's wearing the
exact exact same so I really can't tell
the difference and the makeup revolution
one again is so affordable it's crazy so
this is just wild and it makes me really
excited but with that being said I'm
just chilling I'm about to order some
dinner and eat and I have some emails to
answer and then I'm going to come check
back in I'll check back in right before
I take off my makeup tonight that way
hopefully we can get a couple more hours
in but go she's ready to take off the
lashes but I will be back in a little
bit and I'll see my little sweet baby
soon
alright guys it is why don't my makeup
looks better the lighter it's getting
because it's getting a little dewy so
it's looking a little more natural but
it's getting late at night it's like
8:30 and I think the concealer is the
exact same like I really can't tell I
mean you see a little bit of dark circle
but bum on both sides so that's just my
face anyways what do you guys think
setup in the comment section
let me know do you guys think this is a
dupe I think this is gonna be in Stuart
Ulta pretty soon I don't know when but
like I said I got online and I
definitely going to be using it way more
I'm actually gonna go ahead and order a
few more shapes with the shade actually
after I got powder at my found eight I
mean like everything else on it it
looked really good the shade but like it
looks similar to the Tarte shade
although it was quite a lighter shade
I'm still gonna go ahead and order a
couple more shades but I'm really
pleased with it and I think it is an
awesome concealer and I plan on wearing
it a lot more so I hope you guys enjoyed

I hope it lets you guys know we found a
dupe honey I love you all so much please
