today's video is going to be a date
night makeup tutorial here Billy Madison
playing in my living room whenever I was
little I remember for Christmas my mom
took me to the mall but yo what do you
want a cushion it's a yo but she was
like what do you want and I was I I want
Billy Madison on VHS and those kids were
like kidding polka honest and Lion King
and I'm like I just want Billy Madison
cuz I was the cool kids anyways
basically I just really got inspired and
really wanted to do a tutorial involving
red lips I don't know why I don't know
why I had like its Epiphany and I was
like I wanna do red lips so I figured
what better make it's the world to do
with red lips then a drugs or what am I
then a date night makeup tutorial and I
think this is just a beautiful classic
look to wear out on a date I think it's
very flattering on anyone it doesn't
matter your skin tone and things like
that I think you can pull off a red lip
more the trend pattern we're going torch
it's a matte red lip and that is what
I'm like oh obsessed with right now so I
did use RiRi whoo bye Mac but I know
Gerard's fire-engine and then you can
use the Mac lip liner cherry to fill in
your lips and you end up with a matte
finish just a couple of great
alternative options
is there any oh and I went to a like
that class at the Grove on Saturday and
I learned lots of cool new tricks yeah
I'm gonna be sharing them with you and I
did a really cool face chart I mean she
was pretty cool I am not finished with
her her lips are looking a little janky
but uh I'll finish her up but I had like
so much fun and I learned so many cool
things that I had no clue about his
makeup
I mean the thing is and you know I I
took this cause being a beauty blogger
and have been you know doing people's
makeup for a long time and no one's a
lot about makeup because you can't ever
be like I already know about me
I don't need to take a class you can
never stop learning in makeup that is
the beauty of it so of course I took the
class I learn so much cool stuff and I
can't wait to share it with you guys
enough of my blabber you guys know I
have to have a little story time in the
beginning of every video but word assume
again started oh and bonus this is the
talk-through video so it's going to be
extra long and extra juicy full of
information
do you guys like my bun today oh I need
to get in focus already prime my eyelids
and plaster it on these eyebrows I'm
gonna go in with a Smashbox primer water
here and just do three four five spritz
now I'm gonna go in and add my nude Dior
skin foundation in zero three zero and
I'm just gonna add two drops and that's
my face whenever I do a date night
makeup tutorial I normally do or night
time ago tutorial I normally wear my
nicer foundation whoops got a little on
the hair and yeah just gonna blend this
out all over my face with a kabuki brush
and I'm just gonna grab my it cosmetics
flat top kabuki now what I normally do
is just let all that set in my face and
I'll start working on my I didn't start
over there I'm gonna go in with Peach
Smoothie and just a blending brush I'm
just gonna pop this all over the crease
you can use a cream color or you can
even using a powder foundation and this
is just gonna make the base less tacky
and it's gonna help blend down all those
other colors cuz we don't want no chalk
now we'll go in with Grand Stand this is
a makeup heat foil pigment or foiled
eyeshadow I'm gonna take this on a
shader brush
it's not even damn this is just how the
color looks how beautiful I'm gonna go
in with this little brush here it's like
a 2:17 by Mac but this is actually a
more feom 4-3-3 it's a total dupe for
that and I'm gonna go in with Coco bear
if you have Brown script by Mac that's
the same thing this one's just a little
bit cheaper and I have it on the tip of
my brush here I'm not gonna stab right
into my eye but I'm actually gonna like
lift the brush upward as you can see I'm
not going like this because I don't want
that color to get down onto my lid I
want it to stay focused in the upper
crease area
and we're just gonna go back and forth
you can bring it up a little over here
but I try to keep it kind of low in the
front corner now as simple as pie we're
gonna go in with the eo6 brush from
Sigma which is this team tiny eyeliner
brush it is the bomb and then aren't you
on gel liner we're gonna one yeah I like
to do a big wing like I have on this
I um whenever I just do kind of a simple
I look and wear red lipstick like to
start to do is I give my eye a little
tug which helps me get a straight line
on the eye I don't necessarily recommend
doing this because it's not good for
your skin but y'all know I just do
whatever works I've been doing this
forever which is probably even worse but
it works for me so to just start off
with a stripe like that so whenever it
comes to gel liner or any winged liner
if you go out straight you're gonna get
that thinner long winged liner and if
you go upward with your wing you're
gonna get a short fat wing as you can
see when you come down and just going to
be super fat so I personally like to
kind of go out a little bit
sometimes our eyeliner just does
whatever it wants to and we end up with
whatever God gives us that day but I
mean that happens to me like majority of
the time but I'm gonna start this corner
right here where my lower lash line
meets they connect and then the creates
an eyeball but I'm gonna start there
sure and as you come up you want to you
know get a lighter hand that way you end
up with a point and not like a blunt end
so this is the part where to start
pulling again I don't recommend pulling
your I do as I say not as I do but I
give it a little tug and I don't go to
the very top of the wing but I come
right here so I come right here I start
bringing it down and you can come
straight down like that and you're like
this looks choppy right here so we'll go
ahead and fill in the wing
so now what I like to do is because this
is a little bit choppy you straighten it
out and now I will go and fix this area
by coming up here slowly connecting it
and then we can build up the liner right
here you don't ever want to start with
this area being really big a fast I'm
gonna take embark by Mac this is a super
cool tone brown color you can use mocha
by makeup geek or use any matte brown
clothes it's pretty dark and I'm gonna
get it on the tip of my brush rather
than just like digging my brush into it
just the tip and I'm gonna go to the
wing and I'm gonna go like this going
upward again to create not really a cut
crease look I'm warden just dug within
the eye this gives us more dimension
that way you can like see that crease
you're just gonna use too much about my
makeup geek you can use any light
shimmery color you have on hand I
actually learn in that class that if you
have it a lot of space in a really big
brow bone area just go in with like a
matte eye shadow don't do a shimmery one
because that's all you're gonna be able
to see like when someone will see you
they're just gonna see this shimmer but
I actually talked to the dude and I was
like no don't tell me that I love my
shimmery highlight he was like no you
actually need a shimmery highlight
because you don't have like a lot of
space going on see we're learning
something today i'm gonna be using mac's
clone wear concealer in NC at 30
he's a synthetic brush to apply this to
the under eye area and then another cool
trick is you can sharpen up your winged
liner with it like i'm gonna show you
this little bump in it you guys see that
little bump right there so annoying
we just got rid of him with the liner
but you have to have a synthetic brush
to do that don't go in with a fluffy
brush and then I'm just going to drag
out this concealer I'm gonna put just a
little bit on my nose and forehead that
way everything kind of matches and flows
and now I'm just gonna blend it out I
like to use my kabuki brush but you can
use a Beauty Blender your favorite brush
your fingers your cat your dog I'm just
kidding I forget how much I love Mac
concealer do I use it again and then my
oh my god I love you so much
now we'll go ahead and set this before
it starts to get crazy and crazy lately
I've been using this fit me powder
foundation to set it normally I would
never recommend using a powder
foundation to set your highlight but
it's just been working out really well
for me they're normally too heavy but I
find that this one isn't like it's a
really good one I'm actually gonna use
blunt by Mac this is a oldie but a darn
well goody for powder contouring gonna
get a little bit on one edge of my brush
and I'm gonna start like in my hair and
then we're just gonna bring it down then
we're gonna bring it up and remember
just to kind of stay in your hairline
that way it's one of my biggest like
things that I do wrong I guess you could
say I never stay in my hairline that
will it's a bad habit of mine in the
hair especially for a nighttime look you
can do a heavier contour but I
definitely don't recommend doing that
for any daytime look then I'm gonna go
in with this brush my favorite brush
from morphe to do my nose with it's a
422 and I'm just gonna go right down
with a little bit of that
cat hair is all over my brush miss I'm
bout to have to store them in my drawers
but we gotta go in with warm soul which
is one of my favorite blushes from Mac
and we're gonna add to the apples of the
cheek and flick backward you don't want
to actually have like a pink to your
cheek I like a bright color you just
want to make your face basically look
like it's more than one color because
that foundation is just gonna like make
your face look like it's one color I'm
gonna add a highlight because I'm Laura
and her you know I love my highlight so
I'm actually gonna use this one by Becca
this one is champagne gold I never use
this one and I'm not sure why I don't
Carol I see it that well on my skin I
mean I feel like in the wintertime you
could but can't a little earth under eye
area go Coco bear which was that warm
color we used come on a blend from inner
it's out our corner and I'm using it the
4/3 33 brush from morphe I go out with
embarked again getting it all over the
brush and then I'm going to stay really
close to the lash line but was a lot of
color on it
and just live blend everything out a
little bit more I'm gonna add some black
liner in the waterline this is by YSL
but you can use any black liner you have
on hand I'm gonna add a little bit of
mascara mascara mascara what do you guys
call it tomato tomahto I just banged
lashes and the lashes that I'm using
today are by SL miss clamp Beauty calm
and she is such an awesome person you
guys she's an actual youtuber and I'll
leave her channel and Instagram down
below her Instagram is bomb.com her
being a beast like a fairyland like you
guys have gotta see it she's doing great
things with her new little business of
lashes and makeup brushes there are many
things so I definitely want to use these
lashes and today I'm using dangerously
glam they are quite beautiful I've used
them once before but huh yeah I love
them they're beautiful beautiful I'm
just super easy to apply and I'm really
impressed with them so yes I wanted to
give her a shout out cuz I feel like you
guys need to know about her and I'm just
gonna be using my clear white lash glue
by duo and I promise I'll let it dry
before I do my intro because I always
get in trouble with you guys for not
letting my lash glue dry no one who's
gonna pop these oh and I've already
trimmed them and shaped them to my
eyelid so we don't have no complications
let's try I'm gonna go in with my
favorite red lip liner and that's cherry
by Mac
I'm gonna go in with RiRi woo by Mack
and these lips are bad as red as you can
you know uh-huh
try and get on my teeth lastly I like to
just blend everything out one more time
before I add my mac fix+ spray or
whatever settings foot spray you're
gonna use and so now that I look
completely and totally soaked that's
gonna dry but this also sets your makeup
and it like helps with every color on
your face to be more enhanced like this
highlight its gonna be a little bit more
enhance my blush had some shimmer in it
whatever had shimmer in it even your eye
shadow is gonna be more enhanced once
this stuff dries this is an awesome
product and I think everybody should
kind of invest in it not kinda just do
it just throw it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
