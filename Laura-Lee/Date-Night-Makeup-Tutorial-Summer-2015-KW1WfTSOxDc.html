going to be this makeup tutorial it's
really maroon and gold it's so pretty I
love this mega tutorials so much I would
wear it every day of the week but I feel
like it might be a little heavy to wear
every day of the week but you know I
don't care I'll wear it everyday look
hey hey I forgot my mac fix+ spray be
sure to follow me on my social media
before you leave this video we're just
gonna jump right in and get started and
I'm not gonna blab too much so uh let's
go start off this tutorial already have
my eyes prime with this Tarte CC eye
primer I like to do is I always go in
with a pretty much neutral shade this
one is Peach Smoothie always want to
call it orange smoothie
this is an m4 4-1 brush from morphe so
basically I just blend this all over the
primer this is gonna help soften up the
primer and that way when you go in with
the darker color it's not gonna be like
in stick it's gonna smooth out easier
next I'll go with chickadee by makeup
geek this step is like 100% optional I'm
just gonna warm up the lid as you can
see like how warm and toasty it made it
look right there Toad's don't have to
add chickadee I mean it's it looks like
a scary color but once you add on all
the other colors I promise it's not as
intimidating and I'm just gonna blend
that in the upper crease area doing
small circular motions this is just
little Real Techniques brush that has
been with me for many moons my friends
I'm gonna go in with Java this one is my
honest Sacha Beverly Hills it has
quickly become one of my favorite
eyeshadows it's just such a great
neutral brown color which sometimes they
can actually be hard to find like the
perfect neutral Brown anyways I'm just
gonna blend this right on top of the
other colors you may wonder why I'm
adding so much color that are so neutral
like but I promise you it like builds up
and it makes it so nice and gradient
looking I'm gonna take that all the way
from the inner corner into the outer
corner
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
brown script by Mac which is like one of
the best colors in the universe um
actually Coco bear from makeup geek is a
dupe for is so I'll get you a Coco bear
and I'm gonna move that right on top of
Java I know lots of colors but promise
it'll turn out greedy I'm gonna grab a
little bit of bitten by Micah peek this
is one of my favorite colors make it
peak has ever created it's such a
beautiful maroon color really pigmented
so I'm just gonna get a little bit on
the end of this brush here and I'm going
to start applying it to the outer corner
of the eye
and then I'm gonna take this blendy
brush right here and I'm gonna blend it
all well so it was a really light hand
that way we don't move too much color
around
and I'm gonna take a little bit more at
the color and I'm actually just going to
apply it to the inner corner just soften
that up a little bit pretty much leave
in the center of the eye plane that's
because we're going to go in with a
little bit of snake bike bike hmm snake
bite bite color pop this one their new
summer colors and they're the bomb.com
and I'm just gonna pop that right in the
center and look how pretty that is
that's like hello I'm beautiful and I'm
here wait let's get in focus right there
oh my god oh my okay I'm quit being
annoying alright so basically I just
apply that to the center when you do a
little more over here to the center of
the eye and now to soften up this harsh
edges I'm gonna go back in with this
little brush
I'm gonna soften up the edges
I'm gonna grab just a little bit of
nylon by Mac which is my favorite color
to highlight the brow bone and I'm gonna
highlight the brow bone
who does she sing a little pencil brush
here actually wasn't gonna do a wing
liner but then I just I really want to
for some reason so I'm gonna go in with
a little bit of this clay pot liner from
Tarte and this little yo six liner brush
from Sigma which is my favorite liner
brush you can totally skip wing liner or
any liner on this look though you know
make every look that I do your own you
know just take a little something from
is what I recommend yeah oh you can
recreate the whole look do you think
shit is
I'm gonna go in and do my foundation and
my face makeup I'm gonna go in with my
pore fessional facial primer by benefit
gonna apply this to the areas I never
put this stuff all over my face I just
took my primer to areas that I think
needs smoothing out a little more like
right through here and basically that's
it unless it's like a moisturizing
primer then I'll probably put it
everywhere going in with the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation which is an
awesome foundation I have a full review
