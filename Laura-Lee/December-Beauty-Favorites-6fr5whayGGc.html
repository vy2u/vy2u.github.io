video is going to be my monthly papers
and we are finishing off the year would
December like we do every year I have
lots goodies to share with you that I'm
really excited about like I am every
month in my favorites I might being
super redundant thumbs up this video if
you already noticed that I'm missing it
some now I just wanted to say I'm not
wearing a quilt around my neck it's like
one scarf thing the background is back
but again super temporary it'll probably
be gone next video for you guys so let's
just jump right in and get started as we
start up every favorites with my
favorite song of the month and that is a
hard one Lourdes disclosure it's like
the greatest song I love it I love Lord
I love her music so that's been my
favorite song in the month my favorite
TV show of the month has really just
been Christmas movies not just a TV show
it's definitely been Christmas vacations
best movies ever if you haven't seen it
pause this favorites and go watch
Christmas vacation huh read yes and I
feel like my Christmas like back home
and Alabama or something like that then
I will jump right into products and I
want to talk to you guys about my
favorite cleanser of the month so I
think this is that a dupe for that bio
whatchamacallit cleanser that cost you
an arm and a leg and your firstborn
child this one is from Garnier and it is
like an amazing makeup remover and it
takes such a small amount I haven't even
use that much of it because mostly
Epogen just removing the eyeliner and
the liquid lipstick so that's why I have
to use a lot of it but it's such a like
alcohol-free amazing makeup remover so
I'll just you're supposed to be able to
like cleanse your whole face and go to
bed but I would never be able to put
something like this or makeup remover on
my face and just go to bed and wash my
face so I get the hard step off with
this and then I wash my face and it's
been everything and more and also
another skincare product I've been
loving is the ultra radiance facial
rehydrating mist friend Patrick Starr
like you haven't heard of her before but
had this in their suitcase and I'm one
of those people who are like oh
something pretty
so pretty so just art spray my face with
the NFL in love so it's awesome and I
recommend it next what I want to talk to
you guys about are the two new hot I
don't want to tap them hard cuz I'm
normally really aggressive but I don't
want them to break them like big to new
highlighters from TV so the first one is
rosy glow is that my favorite no warm
glow is my favorite but I think they're
both amazing it's the dual highlighters
they have the candle light one but
they're so pretty
they're so freakin pretty I can't even
breathe oh this one's my favorite
mm-hmm that's DUI in it like we're gonna
have to pop some on right now we just
have to like oh my goodness yes honey I
mean like I should just apply it and be
like that's it that's all you need to
know that's all you need to know product
that I've been loving ooh is not the Z
palette from Sephora that's a pretty
cool Z palette but what's inside it is
the new eyeshadows from honest I'll show
you our pearly Hills not all of them are
new but a lot of these gorgeous shimmery
colors are new and they are rockin my
socks they're really pretty my favorite
thing from Anastacio is their shimmery
shades or they're like Metallica shades
I have this one right here called
macaroon on my eyes today and I'm gonna
play I played with some of these but not
all of them but I'm gonna be playing
with them and I have played with all of
the mattes and they're gorgeous
so pigmented so amazing I don't know if
I mentioned this in my last favorites if
I did I'm gonna edit out of this one but
this is the wicked liner from Sigma and
I just have love-hate relationships with
gel liners because either they dry out
or I love them for a minute and then I
hate them but this one by sigma has just
been all that and more it doesn't like
crust up you know what I mean like it
crusty and it's super gel like so it's
like kind of goopy but I like that
because it doesn't dry out too easily
just been the shows like things that
I've been loving is the Quai or key
whatever you want to call them
sunglasses I got this the only reason I
bought them is because they were 30% off
off nasty and they were cheap but like
the only sunglasses almost doing real
money on are like rate
or something that's like polarized you
know I ain't playing with some sunglass
it's like this and like paying big
dollars for me I'm just not gonna do it
but let me just show you why I love them
that's why they're amazing look at them
it's like if you ever saw someone in
public that you hate it you know like ow
my only reaction would be and the thing
that I love the most about them is that
like a pea head like my head is so
stupid small like it's ridiculous and
this sunglasses they don't stick out too
far like normally cat eye sunglasses or
like out to here and I look like I'm
wearing clown glasses but these are like
small oh by the way these are kitty the
next thing I've been loving are these
ardell lashes like I don't know I've had
these forever in my last door and I just
skip over them every time but I'm
wearing them right now these are the
double-up 203 lashes they are so much
lash but they're so feminine because
they have like a little curl on the end
I don't know I feel like they make any
look just look very dolly
and very girly but then you still get
that feedback oon lash which I'm all
about and they're drugstore so
affordable
I've indigestion thanks things I just
think it's like that cutest thing in the
world is this palette this is from
benefit it's so cheeky palette I think
it was an amazing deal I'm sure I don't
even know who's still for sale I hate
when I do that really though you get
like how many you get five of the big
box Oh blushes and they're like the full
size I think and you also get hoola was
just one of the greatest bronzers of all
times and then you also get a what's up
and a liner and a mascara but I just
think it's the cutest thing ten
packaging such a good deal I love this I
like it for travel too because it's a
hard case and you have your bronzer and
your blush and your mascara and your
eyeliner and your highlighter in here
it's not gonna break the best is this
mascara from Marc Jacobs look you can't
even see it with the background this is
their velvet noir mascara and it's
marvelous and I love just like how black
it is I love how it builds up the lashes
well make it
I'm beat it's just my my go-to I've been
using it every single day every day so
now we'll go over the lip products that
I've been using every day of the week do
you hear me sore by Mack is just the
best lip liner ever it is what I had the
combo on today like I said I'm wearing
it every single day
I'm almost annoying with a cuz it's like
we change your lip color Oh
sorr this is like a super popular color
and Mac it's just a lip liner and it's
like a gorgeous pink kind of like a
dusty rose pink and now what I've been
putting in the center of my lips as you
can see I kind of have that combo on
today I don't kind of have it on today I
do have it on today
this is bare with me but it's the colors
and that's all someone that had it on
and segrand they had on their lips and
they're just I just saw the picture and
I was like don't care what it is I have
to buy it right now so like within 2.3
seconds of seeing the bear with me on
that person's lips I bought it and not
the effect the social media has on us it
may have it on you but it has it on me
too ex product I want to talk to you
guys about is the Ultra HD this is the
brand-new concealer from makeup forever
and immediately whenever I saw the
packaging I was like this is gonna be
like clay coming out of here like but
then I poured it out of the tube and it
was just like pure liquid absolutely
amazing concealer it's my favorite
concealer and I am shade y31 that's the
one that I have been obsessed over I've
you seen quite a few tutorials I'm sure
you guys knew that this was coming up in
the favorites seriously I highly
recommend this concealer to anyone it
covers great it blends out smooth it
highlights the face and then I'm color
pop I just want to share this really
quick this is puppy love and so from the
NK la which is the no kill la best
friends um the Animal Society so they're
donating a hundred percent of the
proceeds to the society so they can stop
putting the animals to sleep and find
them a home or giving them a longer
chance to live anyways so if you do make
it order from colour-pop I just asked
that one of the colors please be puppy
love please be pop-up puppy love
I'm dead serious I'm probably gonna
order five or six of them and give them
to my friends and family members at $5 a
pop
so please make it puppy love save the
babies also this little house of lashes
lash glue and black this little mini I
bought like a massive box of the lashes
because House of lashes are some of my
favorites and they had them on sale
during like the Cyber Monday or whatever
and it came with a bunch of little mini
lash glue they're the bomb I've been
using everyday I love this black because
it doesn't like shine back with the
Wyatt that's the problem I was having
like even my black lash glues when the
white it was like Shh be shiny so like
flashback it will look like I had crusty
crusty crust all over my lash line and
really it was just a little bit of lash
glue so Jaeger I just want to mention
this brush like real quick to face mr.
right the perfect powder brush it's so
cute as its own bowtie this brush is
cuter than me I'm okay with that and we
just talked about this this brush
cleaner is my favorite and I don't know
if you can see it floating around in
there oh yeah you can I was trying to
clean a brush and like the whole brush
just like fell down in there so it's
like disintegrating in the brush cleaner
and I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna have
to like throw this away lastly I just
want to mention real quick is the ultra
Repair intensive lip balm from first a
beauty I have all the trouble in the
world with dry lips and let me tell you
the number one fix to dry lips is
drinking more water it will fix your dry
lips in a matter of an hour or two it's
not like if you drink more water in two
weeks you'll notice the difference no
it's almost like an instant difference
so just drink more water but besides
that at night timer right before you put
on your liquid lipstick or something
this lip repair it smells weird and
honestly it smells a little bit funky
and it looks a little bit funky because
it looks like ear wax to me and it kind
of grosses me out but it works so good
so I just keep using it but it's just an
intensive lip balm and it is there to
protect your little babies and I know
that this winter your little kissers are
gonna get dry and crusty don't nobody
want to be kissing no dry and crusty lip
girl I'm gonna say for my favorites I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
do don't be stingy give it a thumbs up I
love you guys thank you so much for
being here and I hope to see you all in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
