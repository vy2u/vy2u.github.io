lush just be real first of all hey it is
so I have gotten new toys that came in
the mail this is the lipstick holder
tower from Zara beauty
oh there freaked out so hard when I came
in the mail and packaged it or like
showed you guys it on snapchat so follow
me on snapchat my lipsticks did not look
like this before this video they were
everywhere so we're actually gonna dig
how all my lipstick we're gonna clean
them out we're gonna get rid of some and
then we're going to store them in here
if you guys want to see me fill up my
lipstick tower and rub out old lipstick
and hopefully get some inspiration to
clean out your makeup collection well
then please just keep watching this is
just too much fun
so this guy here is full of lipsticks
we're going to pull all this out then we
have some MAC lipsticks here we're going
to pull out a have some lipsticks hiding
in here and lastly I have a few that
made their way in my lip gloss door
we're going to pull out
hi my name is Laura and I need more
lipstick these may be staying in the
Alex nine drawer I'm just going to set
them aside they're all the wicked
lipsticks by NYX because I don't know if
they'll fit yet feel like it'll be best
to operate by brand here such as Milani
and Mac the ones that I know I'm not
going to get rid of and go ahead and put
them in the thing by their brand so we
don't mixing brands and that way I can
keep up with them a little bit better
and I'm also going to try to kind of
kind of color-coordinated
this is me or how beautiful are all
these gold lipsticks right now I wish
every lipstick was gold like that would
be so cool
moving on we're going to put Mac and
decide
can we all just have a really sad moment
right now because I'm short one Mac
lipstick why
have six of the lorac alter-ego
lipsticks and I'm definitely not going
to get rid of any of the six colors I do
love these so I have a six slot right
here that I'm gonna pop all these in
very excitedly yay
so that worked out really well you have
a lot in our little system already but I
don't need all of these lipsticks I'm
gonna be getting rid of a few I think
I'll get rid of this black lipstick by
NYC I would keep it as like a Halloween
thing but I have a black in my wicked
lippies so I don't need to black I think
I'm going to get rid of this one by it
cosmetics and give it to moms or sisters
because it's used but I never use it so
there's going to point me keeping it as
well as this la girl lip stick is just a
darker color that I have plenty of and I
don't use I'm also gonna get rid of this
little NYX lip stick here I haven't had
it that long but I just haven't ever
worn it so there's no reason for to keep
it I think it's time to get rid of all
my color whispers because these are just
old you sure this one here came in a
beauty bag and I just never have touched
it or worn the color but it's not still
I'm probably gonna give this one away to
the moms Dooku's what I got at it a bit
it is a beautiful purple color but I
just don't see myself wearing it I have
other color similar so I'm going to get
rid of this one too it turns out I have
six of the wet-and-wild lipsticks which
I love my wet and wild lipstick so I'm
just gonna pop all of these sometimes
the name on the bottom of um hello what
are you doing when while go I have three
out flip sticks and I do love these too
I'll keep these close fine this will be
our little drugstore section right here
some randoms I'm not going to get rid of
I love these girl active lipstick it's
just a nude and a red
I'm just going to keep those and pop
them in with the jar the Milani section
oh and then I got these new ones they're
so freakin cute from the bomb and I'm
gonna keep them in the package and I'm
just gonna pop them in this last three
slots now I have to Napoleon partes
lipstick which will fit so perfectly
right there I have to buy dishes colors
I lower my dosage others that it sticks
I'm going to pop this and there have the
Maybelline matte lipstick sound yeah but
these actually and the bottom spot right
here trying to put them the right way
that way I can read which one they are
actually gonna go ahead and get rid of
all three of these from lipsticks just
because they are such neutral colors I
have so many lipsticks these colors so
there's no reason to keep them I have
this little beauty YSL lipstick it's one
of my favorite matte lipsticks I'm just
going to pop them in right there I have
two lipsticks by Serena Tarantino and I
am actually going to put some in right
here girl look at that lipstick um now
I'm going to take one of these Muji
drawer systems that came out of this
little three piece right here and I'm
gonna put it um the modern matt said I
love these lipsticks so much and so I
definitely want to keep them up front on
my desk
yeah I guess I'll put on my little mini
sedet lipsticks by Kat Von D these are
awesome lipsticks these are like my
go-to lipsticks so I'm going to pop them
in it right here I'm going to take
another drawer out of my Muji Joyce's
home and I'm just gonna apply these
lipsticks that they don't have a home so
we just gonna make them a home so I just
have some Sephora subjects with me the
most random brands like Estee Lauder I'm
not sure what that brand is e e main e
yeah I'm gonna keep all these wicked
lipsticks for my Halloween tutorials um
but if I don't use them after that I'll
probably give them away or get rid of
them somehow I love it so much you
probably notice I didn't put anything on
the top and that's because it's going on
my lack shelf so nothing's going to fit
up here unfortunately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
