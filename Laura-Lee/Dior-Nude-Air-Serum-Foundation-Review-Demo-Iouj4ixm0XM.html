awkward because I was totally in focus
today's video is very exciting because I
have found something new out on the
market of course I snatched it up
because I wanted to do a review for you
that right I'm gonna be reviewing the
new dealer air nude nude air foundation
I see everything wrong every time
your skin's nude air foundation I'm in
shade zero three zero which is medium
beige and I picked this up at Sephora it
was fifty three dollars and I know a lot
of types of people here do you order
like uh in Trisha it's only five more
dollars than the NARS foundation so it's
not it is expensive but it is a medium
price for a high-end foundation you know
it's not like a seventy five but it's
not a forty it's a fifty three so it's
right in there it's a good medium price
for a foundation especially being your
if you're interested in learning more in
hearing my experience and meth all and
all the info on this appeal mission
well then please just keep watching
we're going to start this video off with
me showing you the demo of the
foundation because I normally do the
demo at the end and I figured I will let
you guys see what the foundation did for
me and get it closed up in my face and
all that so we're gonna demo it out now
I'm going to apply a little gun in my
hair to hold it back and to start any
liquid foundation you have I definitely
recommend giving it a good shake it says
to shake it on the back of the bottle
but I definitely remain or come in
shaking it because a lot of liquid
foundations the formula and I'm separate
when they just sit there
love the dropper so it looks all metal
but this is actually plastic so normally
what I do here is I'll squeegee it get
some in there and then dupe and then
I'll just apply it to the back of my
hand get started I'm going to start with
this much you can see like how liquidy
is it's like water liquidy and I'm going
to be using this brush to apply it it
says online that they have a number
eleven brush by Z or to apply it it
looks
exactly like this it's a cat tongue
shaped synthetic tapered brush and I
like synthetic brushes to apply any
liquid foundation because it doesn't
absorb your product if you use a beauty
blender I'm sure it will blend it out
absolutely beautifully and it will work
great but whenever you spend fifty three
dollars on a liquid foundation you don't
want to use a sponge because the sponge
whether it's damp it or not is gonna
absorb a lot of your product and you're
wasting products you're just going to
end up washing it out of the sponge and
down the drain it goes or you can just
simply apply this with your fingers I
applied it with my fingers the other day
and I really liked it so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to apply half of it
with this little brush from the kiss of
brushes I'll have it linked down below
the other half of my face and when I
apply with my fingers I'm going to get
some on the brush and I'm going to start
in the center on my face and work
outward
I totally have like a zit or a leftover
from a zit right there and I think
that's kind of a good thing for this
video because you guys can see how sheer
the coverage is you can kind of get a
better idea that way I know that's gross
and weird but doesn't really allows you
to see like what you're going to get
I have prep lling on my nose so you'll
see that too
I'm going to apply two or three more
drops it kind of just pours out rather
than you know measuring it in droplets
it just dumps out kind of did this
happen my poor head alright so this is
me adding probably two layers of this
onto my skin and I'm going to zoom in
you can totally tell there is some
coverage there but if you have a blemish
or an unwanted area it's not really
going to cover it but if you have a
little bit of Darkness as you can see
Epsom purpling you don't really see that
over here so that does provide some
coverage and also my freckles are a
little bit lighter on this side of my
nose whereas are more predominant over
here forehead is pretty clear but you
can see almost a line down the center of
my forehead where this side of my face
is a little bit more matte and then this
side is a little bit more skin like
because it's just my bare skin but you
can tell a little bit where I have the
foundation on this is probably one of
the sheerest foundations though I'll go
ahead and apply with my fingers to the
other side of my face I find it it's
just a little bit hard to get it
completely even on your skin whenever
you use your fingers but the fingers are
definitely doable and I think the more
you use your fingers with this
foundation the better off you'll be with
it like you'll get used to using your
fingers totally using my viewfinder as a
mirror right now sorry that's annoying
to you guys now this is my whole entire
face covered with this foundation and
I'll give you guys a close-up to see
your own opinions and what you think you
can't see my skin coming through this I
mean you totally can still see the
freckling on my nose and it definitely
doesn't like I'm wearing that much
makeup if any makeup
definitely sheer coverage definitely
lightweight feeling um again you can see
my freckly so you can apply see my skin
through this foundation
now that you see with the foundation
actually looks like on the skin I want
to talk to you guys about the foundation
a little bit I feel like you're just
went into a room with all their big
important people and they're like we're
going to change the foundation game and
we're going to come out with something
completely different
I feel like nowadays it's 2015 and cream
contour is really popular and the heavy
conceal and just the full cake face
foundation and do not get me wrong
because I am number one onboard with
cake face foundation and facial makeup
I'm sorry I love it I love the art of
makeup I love piling on a lot of makeup
I have so much fun with makeup I just do
but I feel like you or just took a step
back and they were like let's create
something for the everyday woman this is
super breathable sheer coverage everyday
foundation I want to talk about the
Foundation's claims you will be able to
breathe right through this foundation it
is supposed to be very sure coverage
it's supposed to feel velvety it is an
open ultra always mess up on these parts
it gets a serious and then I screw up so
it turns into goofiness an ultra liquid
foundation it is supposed to enhance
your complexion basically it's miss
being very natural-looking foundation
let your natural radiant skin to shine
through this foundation first
impressions of this whenever I pulled it
out the little dropper I thought that
was pretty friggin cool for a liquid
foundation there's also a little
suctioning thing down in there that
helps any runoff
I feel like this foundation was
definitely perfect for everyday wear not
for nighttime wear or if I was going to
a beauty event and just wanted that fool
pace of makeup definitely would never go
to this foundation for that but if I was
just going to work to school and I just
needed a little bit of coverage just a
little color to my skin and a tad bit of
coverage I would go right to this
foundation it definitely has an
extremely soft velvety finish it just
feels like literally like velvet and
that's the best way to describe
bright skin um I have a few dry patches
on my face right now I normally do and
it doesn't help those out it doesn't
make them worse but it definitely
doesn't cover them I mean it's a sheer
coverage foundation what do you expect
this is not an old free foundation so if
you're in the market for an oil-free
foundation you're like this is something
so lightweight surely it's all free it's
not it does have oils and it does have
SPF 25 in it which is pretty high
profound ation because most foundations
have SPF 15 in it I'm obsessed with the
dropper I think that's like the greatest
invention in foundations it's just so
easy to use especially with a liquid
foundation long-lasting this that's not
a word but we're going to make it a word
today it is pretty long wearing but if
you're a face toucher I'm a nose touch
so I do this a lot really you could
swipe this stuff off your face so fast
but if you don't touch your face at all
I feel like it it will sit on your face
all day long and it won't move I'm
Elliot gives your skin a healthy glow I
feel like you're gonna look super
natural I feel like if you need heavy
coverage or you want things covered up
ya ain't gonna like this guy right here
but I feel like if you're just like I
don't want to look cake face I got a
good skin I want to show off my good
skin but at the same time I want to put
on a little bit of makeup this is your
new best friend I hope you guys enjoyed
it I am wonderful whatever you want it
for you something else
I got raised I will be sure to follow me
on my social media so the tricky
description box for that check the
description box for any additional
information about what I'm worried about
now
I love you guys thank you so much
