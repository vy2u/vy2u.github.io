video is gonna be a Dollar Tree oh you
guys seem to love Dollar Tree house and
when I don't do it for a while you let
me know Maura let's eat a Dollar Tree
haul up I love the Dollar Tree I've
shopped as a dog tree ever since I was
me because my mom always shopped at the
Dollar Tree and she passed that trade
down to her daughter I thought I would
do another Dollar Tree on and share with
you guys some random random random
goodies that I got I actually found a
lot of good Nell stuff so I'm really
excited to share that with you guys um
yeah let's jump right in and get started
and subscribe before you leave first
let's talk about the cool nail stuff
because that's what I'm most excited
about
all right person will talk about I got
paper plates because if you feed your
cats wet food like the food gets gross
no matter what you put it on like it
just gets cakey and gross and nasty and
I don't want to have to like constantly
be scrubbing their dishes so I just feed
them on paper plates and then I throw
the paper plates away because they cost
a dollar where's my nails stuff just put
it in a bag first thing that I got is a
cuticle trimmer I've never used one of
these on my own so my next video of all
my fingers are covered in band-aids we
don't why I want to try it out because
it's either nail people use them like a
champ like but um I don't really see me
using it that well but I'm gonna try it
out I mean it was a dollar you know
hopefully it'll work good
I actually got some these looked really
good so I use I always buy these little
scissors I use them to trim my eyelashes
I use them to trim my eyebrows I use
them cut my ear hairs I'm just kidding
if I have like a big cuticle or
something I have like three pair and
they go dull after a while and honestly
they're just really cheaper normally get
them at Target I just throw them out buy
a new pair but I saw these at the Dollar
Tree and like they looked super sharp
and super good you'd be amazed at the
uses that you can find to use these
little scissors for and I just keep them
in my makeup drawer they're called
cuticle scissors but I use them for
everything okay the next thing I got is
some la colors and nail polishes out
white because I don't own a white nail
polish and I want a white one really bad
do you guys know if la colors nail
polishes are any good do they chip fast
what's the deal with them but they had a
bunch of colors and then I got this
mint green color which I thought would
be really pretty not necessarily for
fall time but I'm probably going to use
it anyways but just more so for this
summer I love mint green it's one my
favorite colors so next I got one of my
favorite eyelash curlers from the Dollar
Tree and you know the little spongy
thing that goes in or the rubber thing
it just once the like lash thing cuts
through it and it gets gooky like it's
just done my favorite lash curler
seriously is on one just like this from
the Dollar Tree and it's just gotten
like gross and cooky little rubber part
so here I am buying another one for a
whopping $1.00 and I love it I recommend
this one and it's by the brand Sachi
Sachi shush shush shush shush - sassy
sassy chic whoo say that three times
fast sassy chic sexy chic gutsy chic
yeah girl I got some bobby pins a
seventy two bobby pins oh I'm very
excited to use them they are a salon
quality a bobby pins a bobby pin to me
though I don't know like it didn't
matter the brand was bobby pins they all
work the same to me that's that's me
though I bought some little plaque
pickers to get your nasty plan out of
your teeth let's talk teeth my teeth are
really crooked you have crowded teeth
you gotta floss them like it's not one
of those optional things anymore so I
always have to floss my teeth I never
don't floss my teeth and it's not
because I'm like oh my god I love
talking about her it's because my teeth
are jacked and food gets in between them
so easy and a half to fall so these make
it super easy and I put them in my purse
hello me my sister have this
conversation every time we're together
about the teeth and the crowded teeth
because her teeth are the same as mine
we're just like your welcome Ashley I
just called you out on YouTube anyways
and then I got some toothpaste a little
mini travel size two bays so lately like
this year has been the most crazy travel
year ever like I feel like every month
of the year I went somewhere seriously
like every single month and then from
here on out for the rest of the year I
plan on well for the next two months I
mean I'm traveling so I've been really
into buying traveling stuff so I bought
this little sanitary or I guess it's
sanitary ba'sa
toothpaste by crest and a tube brushing
you like click the little too for a mean
like what yeah hello
that's when we take him because I'm
gonna be dead honest with you like I
have unpacked my luggage before and my
two boys just like watering around and
my suitcase would like my shoes and I'm
like oh that's nasty then I bought
sponges i buy sponges every time I go to
the Dollar Tree to replace the ones I
have but I was a little upset because
they didn't have the ones with the
scruffy edge these are just like a ball
some hair clips um yeah I love hair
clips I lose them as fast as I buy them
but I love them because if you follow me
on snapchat you should be I have my hair
up 90% of the time and I'm like editing
videos scrubbing the toilet do some
crazy
my hair gets them away cuz I got a lot
of it and so I always put my hair up I
will put my hair to rubberband and then
clip it up secure it secure it security
secure it that way it is not in my way
then I bought some chip clips which I
guess I could use these as hair clips no
that's just tacky well chip sound go
still because I love chips I buy chips
when we go to grocery store buggy is
full of chips and you know it's funny
whenever I moved to California they
don't call shopping carts buggies but in
the southeast you call them a buggy so
that's a language barrier issue
I bought some rubber gloves these suck
really bad but I don't feel like going
to Walmart so I just bought them anyways
I like the actual good ones that like
come up your arms these are short and
they they're really thin and they suck
but I bought them and I bow my god want
more toothbrushes I didn't realize I did
that Laura I get you like together I
guess I'm just like on a rampage with
toothbrushes but I bought some more and
you guys told me to always use soft
toothbrushes not medium ones do I bought
soft ones neck this for food which to me
that's the best part
I bought lifesaver gummy after I finish
filming this video I will eat the whole
entire box then I bald a mini pack of
pistachios which after I eat the
lifesaver companies I will eat all of
these and then about cry babies which
are like the best they these are like a
KD you buy to torture yourself with
because it's so incredibly hard to eat
them and it rubs like the skin off if
your tongue does your tongue have skin
on it I don't
it makes your tongue roll why do people
buy crybabies why did I buy crybabies
what is wrong with me I don't know
what's happening huh I'm gonna eat these
after I get done with the pistachios and
lastly the lady was so kind to wrap this
little grill shim dig in a separate bag
she said slices through the bags like
this for ty it's like a grill cleaner
it looks pretty handy for a dollar like
it looked pretty nice so ya better clean
the grill it says that for this dollar
y'all I hope you enjoyed my super super
super super random Dollar Tree haul I
know I didn't buy any makeup but I'm
saying like I looked at the makeup and I
was like I didn't see anything really
good like anything that I need it to
test out cuz sometimes I buy think she
used to try it out to see if it would be
like a good affordable product to share
with you guys but I really I didn't see
anything that I was too crazy over so I
left that section alone and focused more
on the nail section I love you guys
thanks for watching subscribe before you
leave and I hope to see you all in my
next video yeah is it too late now to
say sorry
cuz I'm
missing more than just your body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
