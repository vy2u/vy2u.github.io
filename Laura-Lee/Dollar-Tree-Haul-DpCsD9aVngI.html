video is a little bit different in it
something that had never film before I
don't even know if you guys want to see
it but I'm filming a Dollar Tree haul
right now and I haven't been to the
Dollar Tree and forever I woke up really
early this morning and I went to the
Dollar Tree in my pajamas and in my
house shoes because I'm a crazy person
Saturday and I just wanted to be cozy
and comfy go shopping and Dom tree is no
judgement okay they do not care found
lots of goodies and this is the most
random stuff ever not even all Beauty
well it's not even mostly beauty related
it's just random stuff that I picked up
and if you don't have dollar trees where
you're located at um everything the
store is one dollar well not you don't
get everything for a dollar but each
item is a dollar see how that can be
confusing so much fun to go there
because you can always trying so many
little goodies I find a lot of food and
candy but if you want to see what I got
for the Dallas though with a yes keep
watching alright alright
digging in the food bag first this is so
random I got the UH
cheese Pacific's I don't know why I was
walking down the aisle and I was like
these looks so yummy but I feel like
they're gonna be a hit or miss I feel
like they're gonna be delicious or
disgusting
who knows so we will see then I just got
a bag of Lay's chips because I've got a
lot of riding around to do this
afternoon and errands and things like
that and so I wanted a snack I know I'm
thinking ahead and most people don't
think like that
but honey food comes first in my
dictionary and I was like I'm gonna need
a snack later give miss a lace then I
got some flips pretzels and you guys
these are the most delicious snack ever
and they're only a dollar they normally
cost more than that if you go to my
Target or wherever I should have bought
more than one pack I love these just as
like a little treat to yourself but lips
pretzels are all
and then about two candies I bought sour
patch these River Tyler I don't really
like sour candies but I bought myself
hot tamales they didn't have red hots
which is my favorite candy but they had
hot somalis which will have to do so I
just want come there and then Easter
time is right around the corner so I got
em yeah oh you smell like cat food so I
got something these are the cutest
little things ever and I've always loved
Pete and there's just nothing but sugar
and they're so delicious
and my mom always put him in my Easter
basket when I was little so now I buy
them for myself wonder how long it will
take me to eat all these 30 seconds and
now we'll go over the bag that's
actually like stuff and not food the
first thing I got with this bag of
cotton balls I was just simply out of
cotton balls and I use cotton ball what
are you doing in that bag just simply
need it some time balls I bought myself
some are usable rubber gloves because ah
you guys I I'm kind of like cleaning I
know that's weird but it's just
nothing's relaxing you just get your
mind off your cell phone you're the
internet everything and you just clean
your home and I guess it's kind of like
a stress reliever you don't really think
about the internet and social media and
all this who blog just clean them a
tolet here hanging out and so I just
bought some gloves because the ones that
I have I stab them with a knife by
accident and now they have a whole one
and my little finger gets wet every time
I do so I don't know why that's so funny
to me but it's hilarious but um yeah so
I just got some more then I got some
more Betty Crocker easy silk containers
I think Stellar's lunch a lot well okay
not a why let me not give myself that
much credit but I think his lunch and he
is so bad about leaving my containers
and his refrigerator at work Franco my
container
I just bought a 2-pack and they were a
dollar I don't know I'll I should have
bought more these yeah okay I got these
little mini hair clips I think Michelle
with Ready Set glamour she
like you need some hair claws in your
life she called some hair cause I think
I think that's what she called him
anyways so I saw these there I was just
like browsing and I was like I need some
hair claws so these are little mini ones
and I thought it would be cute to just
take my hair
I don't know and like do like a half see
up that was like a bud and I like do
something with it I'm gonna do stick
with them I don't know but I both hair
falls then about a new eyelash curler
because I have two and I can't find
either of them I've gone through all 18
drawers that I have a makeup can't find
one of them and so I just bought a new
one for $1 it's not the best thing ever
it was a dollar anyway then about some
batteries because I got a new face brush
cleanser you guys know I used someone
from buy to brush um it's really cheap
smiley $23 well the same company came
out with a new one that I got and it
takes batteries as well and so I can't
wait to share that one with you guys but
and it's gonna be really cheap as well
but guess new batteries for hey then I
bought a knife I don't know guys my
knives are so crappy and I'm pretty sure
this is gonna be a crappy knife too
because it was a dollar and I get into
this cycle buying crappy knives but I
bought a new knife because I love
Tomatoes like I eat lemons every single
day I put I probably go through a two
lemons a day putting them in my water
and then um tomatoes I like to slice
Tomatoes and I'm like every night and
you gotta have a serrated knife to do
that and I saw just like the previous
things that you ever did see so I just
bought a new one see how long that lasts
how many of you guys go through hair
ties more than you go through toilet
paper I understand where they go who is
stealing them from me I'll have this
pack and it will be empty within the
next two weeks and they'll all be
missing there's some girl out there that
has all the missing hair ties in the
world I'm telling you so or lastly about
a new toothbrush I am one of those
people who actually replaces their
toothbrush every single month and I
don't know why I think I just like I
think I just like new toothbrushes it's
not just
fact of cleanliness I just like buying
toothbrushes so I just bought a new one
and in case you guys are wondering I use
medium strength because hard strength
makes my gums bleed and soft strength
does not clean my teeth well enough I
always buy my toothbrush is green isn't
that weird like no matter what I always
buy great for me but I think everybody
has a little things about themselves
that they just kind of do and I kinda
feel like this video told you guys
something about myself like when my
cleaning and with my eating and my
toothbrushes kind of cool
I'm not doing this haul and you giving
us a break from talking about makeup
just talking about life and stuff do you
guys shop at the Dollar Tree I love the
Dollar Tree I have a minute forever
