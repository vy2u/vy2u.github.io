is there always a water bottle and every
video that I do I went to the Dollar
Tree and it's been a hot minute since I
got a dollar tree house so I thought why
not do it all the tree hall and share
with you guys how my goodies you guys um
seemed to like the past tune you request
it here and there for me to do another
one so here I am with another Dollar
Tree haul this one was a Dollar Tree
right I buy the most random stuff and
share with you guys so I'm not going to
blab too much we're going to jump right
in and get started I'm going to show you
what I got from the dollar whoa
out I got two of these containers I
always love getting just their
containers because it's like the
cheapest place to get them and their
Rubbermaid so they're really nice and
mine get dirty and gross and stained and
stuff mildew sinal oh so gross so I like
to just find my replacements every time
go to the Dollar Tree I think I get like
one or two packs of these just to be
safe then I just grabbed an oven mitt
because I literally have one in my house
one of iment I've been using like dish
towels to get stuff out of the like oven
like Oh try not to fry my hand off so I
was like um I'm gonna buy oh it smells
horrible
Oh smells like chemicals are like old
mildew gross but that was a dollar but
it smells like it was a dollar I got
some band-aids because I bought these
adorable shoes like what's so pretty I
can't even tell you like how pretty they
are they're like one out of ten they're
ten but the back of them the zipper part
rubbed a hole in the back of my leg
walls in Vegas and literally left me
with a big fat scab so my thought was
because the shoe is about this color of
a band-aid I'm just gonna put a band-aid
over the zipper part when I wear them
people are gonna be like why you have a
bandaid on your shoe stick I have a lot
of lipsticks but on standby this stuff
for you guys because I like to try it
out and if it's really good I'm gonna
let you know and hopefully you're all a
trio have it - but this is LA girl and
it's in pretty packaging it's like this
white packaging it just says lipstick on
it the colors like a coral color ooh and
it's actually like really creamy and
pigmented see this is why I do these
things could you need - no no though
it's Elvis has too much of a shine to it
oh you know what it's a little bit too
shimmery for me I thought it was going
to be like a a solid coral color like a
flat coral but it has a lot of
we're in it so I don't know if that's
going to be my jam fish but my bigger
Jim not my jam I bought another product
that look really pretty from LA Colors
this is their la bronzer and the
packaging didn't look like this but
whenever I was younger and me my sister
I remember us using la bronzer you don't
remember the end result that I just
remember us using it and this one looks
oh my gosh my nail clawed it but this
one looks super pretty and like shimmery
oh you know what this feels really
creamy the bronzer comes off a little
bit sheer but this would actually be a
really pretty eye shadow and I think it
would be a really pretty like glowy
bronzer so this was only $1 and it has
like the little sunshine on the
packaging like that oh my gosh I got
some Charlie bright crawlers so good
yeah so if you guys I've never been to
America and you do the try American
candy pusher this are American candy try
the trolly bright crawlers I love to see
if you guys agree with me and like them
just so gross I'm sitting on camera is
basically brought my favorite hair
product in the whole entire world of
banana clips it's not at all alone but
it's like this simplest contraption in
the world they will save your life of
your hairs in your face I have these in
my purse by my bathtub by the toll it up
my butt like everywhere go missing just
as much as rubber bands which brings us
to our next item I stick with Dollar
Tree hair ties if you buy like the
Dollar Tree brand one they don't work as
good and they actually break like so
easy but these will last me longer than
the $22 to revamp the Dollar Tree ones
only wrap around my ponytail twice and
so it's a little bit too loose but not
tight enough and it's just like why
won't you wrap around three times and
the goodies ones that they do the full
three wrap around and your hair is so
tight yeah I would rather have seven
goodies hair ties than $20 tree hair
ties you get what I'm saying but then I
bought these little things they're like
jumbo plastic closed pins is what
they're called but about these for my
backdrop because it's like two
so you can see the fabric wrinkles and
believe it or not actually bought six of
these at Home Depot and they weren't
even that cheap and I lost them all like
I got home and I never found them again
I wondered they just didn't put them in
the back or like what happened with that
but I bought um at the Dollar Tree and I
was like um hello these are only a
dollar like I wouldn't be mad if I want
these those kind of mad though the other
ones down because I think was a dollar
per clip
sounds like six dollars next I bought
some old lace so this is I love Olay
soap and I love bar soap so this one is
the ultra moisture and I think you can
probably get this cheek Rawal Mart like
you can probably get a two or four pack
at Walmart for like two dollars or so so
if you see how that would be like
cheaper than buying one bar for a dollar
which this bar looks teeny teeny tiny
but I bought it anyways because I'm out
of my Olay soap so I was like win of the
Dollar Tree so again that's a little bit
of Crest toothpaste because we are going
to be traveling and this too it doesn't
look like a small - but compared to the
Jumbo tube we have it's a smaller tube
so I just thought I would buy this just
for our upcoming travels oh boy all
another thing normally whenever I start
my makeup look because I use such a
thick I primer using the Mac Paint Pot I
like to just over a cream eyeshadow just
to lighten it up that what is not so
grippy and that eyeshadows blend out
easier so then I saw this one my wedding
lob which was the Glee cream color that
I always use and so I was like um yes
and if it breaks when I travel I won't
be mad
look how cute it's like oh and it's like
really pigmented and super creamy so
this little booger is coming with me on
all my adventures felt this pack of
Trident gum and I bought it in a bag
because you know they like the little
square box system they always get crush
and gum starts flying out everywhere and
this is like a 20 pack and it Ziploc
comes like don't mind if I do
I never knew the Dollar Tree had oil
blotting paper but I mean they do is
like Dollar Tree brand but let's see if
it works you know oh my god guys Oh No
but to Olli because I just did my face
and I had a chance I get hot I think it
worked
hey there mediocre I don't give them 100
 ibuprofen
I very meat war time you never take
ibuprofen tylenol anything like that but
there are times in your life where you
would rather cut your foot off and not
take it to a non long-term situation IV
prep in town I was actually pretty bad
for you so above try not to take it you
know if we have a little headache Oh
bite me like have a little bit of soda a
little caffeine to get rid of it rather
than take like 2 big tunnel or something
so we definitely try not to but we have
absolutely no pain killer in the house
and that's like scary to me like what if
you had a horrible toothache or
something oh I bought comment I feel
like I'm doing I like infomercial honey
story is I was watching an infomercial
at like 3:00 in the morning do you guys
ever do that and just for like this
amazing blender and it's like eight
people gathered around like a fake
island in a kitchen and the guy has like
two of the blenders going like mixing up
drinks and you have all these pretty
ladies on stools like waiting for their
drinks and he's like talking explaining
about the blender and how great it is
and the blenders are so loud it's
literally like the ladies were just like
and it was like we can't hear anything
you crazy people like when you think the
camera guy would be like but nothing
they just like went on and they turned
off the blender they're like that was so
great yes um yes we agree with you
completely like what you're all fired
that was horrible so late night
television gets interesting got some
sponges actually a subscriber told me to
determine why your sponges that you can
put them in the microwave so it was
pretty cool Ashley I got some tinsel or
punch to beat people to break into my
house with just use temple to cover
everything and to do everything so
Baltimore temple I didn't even know they
had this at the Dollar Tree yeah
