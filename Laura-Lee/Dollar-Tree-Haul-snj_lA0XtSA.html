video is going to be a Dollar Tree haul
my last Dollar Tree haul is my limos
dislike video on my youtube channel so I
figured in honor of that we have to do
another one I always like to think that
that dislike button is accidentally
getting clipped by people who think
they're you know clicking the thumbs up
dance event like lips pumps down so lots
of mistakes on that video I know I
snapped at you guys and I was like hey I
just went to the Dollar Tree and so many
of you were like please do another haul
so it's like okay girlfriend don't worry
- so excited to share my goodies with
you guys oh I got some good stuff I love
the Dollar Tree so you want to see
what's in the bag well then just keep
watching okay moving on we're gonna dig
right in um I actually got some makeup
this time so I got the LA Colors
eyeshadow palette and this one just says
chic on it helps with a bunch of
different little colors and it came with
one of those sponge brushes but it fell
out and it's gone now thank I noticed
about this palette after the fact that I
bought it is the fact that all the
colors and it pretty much looks the same
except for like three colors all the
colors seem to be pretty shimmery rather
than met and they do seem to be a little
bit dry but I don't think it's the worst
palette in the world I actually think
the color scheme is really pretty
and I think if you're just getting into
makeup and you don't want to spend a lot
on makeup hit up the Dollar Tree then I
actually picked up an eyeshadow which I
was pretty excited about because this is
a Maybelline Color tattoo pure pigment
eyeshadow so these are like five six
seven dollars at the drugstore so I was
like hello good deal here that had a few
colors but I just got one this is number
55 barely braz ins a very pretty
shimmery everyday eyeshadow color I
think you could jazz this color up or I
think you could just wear it by itself
on a daily basis such a great deal so if
you guys see like Maybelline or
something out there I definitely
recommend you pick it up one a good way
to grow your makeup collection that way
you have more options and
it's just a really cheap way to do and I
saw that they had the crest 3d white
radiant mint a toothpaste which I really
liked and crest 3d white toupee so I got
two tubes of it because it's only a
dollar and like a small tube like this
at Walmart's like three or four dollars
so hopeless like don't mind if I do
next this is a really good shave gel I
mean it's pretty basic but it's a good
one I got some more pure silk shave gel
this one is in raspberry mist
I've just finished up my other can of it
so I got some more and like I said it's
a dollar and it's a pretty good shape
gel for a dollar some I'll take it then
just to get these on my wigs they're
stabbing me in the leg
I've had some fake flowers I just got
two bundles of them I felt they were so
pretty fake flowers at Hobby Lobby and
Michaels can be a little bit expensive
like one big one was $10 so I was like
and thank you I don't even know what
these are
carnations duh so I got some carnations
my mom would be disappointed that I
didn't know what this was sorry mom
then I picked up some cotton rounds
these things are great for applying your
toner to your face after you got done
washing it and I've been out for
entirely too long so I just got some
cotton around then I picked up some of
the little aim precision gloss picks and
I like to use string floss but my cat
doesn't let me do that anymore because
we caught her in the trash can eating it
and tell her freaked out and she was
like choking on it and he pulled it out
of her throat and I'm talking about we
pulled a piece like this long out of her
throat she was like choking hey if I
like the string floss anymore I know a
lot of people neglect flossing their
teeth but I like a crooked teeth so I
mean I gotta floss illan they gotta be
floss so now we're using the floss picks
X from the Dollar Tree I bought a
lighter some people were able to spin
these on their fingers in I can so I
bought this lighter because I saw these
at Target and it was 350 for one and it
was a dollar for this point at the top I
bought more containers because like I
mentioned in my last Dollar Tree haul
that's how we cease at work
sometimes food stays in on four entirely
too long and I just throw them away
ma'am I'm not I'm not claiming that it's
not worth it for me so I just buy more
got this little two pack of the Betty
Crocker easy seal containers I bought
more sponges I really like these sponges
because I know sponge hoards a bacteria
but I like them anyways to think they do
a good job cleaning and they do and I
throw them away pretty often so I just
got another three pack of them first
more planning supplies I always keep
Sammy wipes is what I call them just
Harry wipes around my makeup desk
because after I get em at doing my
makeup it looks like a war zone over
there so I like to wipe down the area
because I mean you're putting that
product on your face so you want it to
be like a sanitary area so we're gonna
see how these work I'm not going to be
able to see if it kills the bacteria I
don't have eyesight that will but we're
going to see how all these clean because
these are like the knockoff brand and I
prefer for rocks about how there's some
airheads that in last long about two
more kitchen knives I bought these in my
last haul they're actually really great
serrated knives so I bought two more and
lastly I bought some slummy Jimmy's hair
I love slim jims they're so incredibly
unhealthy for you but they're her
delicious and I could probably eat this
all four of these sitting right here and
that is it for my Dollar Tree haul hope
