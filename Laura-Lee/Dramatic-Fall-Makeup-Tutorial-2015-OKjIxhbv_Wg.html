going to be a makeup tutorial obviously
you saw that in the title why is there
always a cat hair stuck to my lip did
this really dark smoke cranberry look I
think it would be ideal for a night out
kind of look I mean this could be your
everyday makeup if you wanted it to be
because this is my everyday makeup hope
you guys are excited to see this
historial give it a thumbs up if you
liked it I'm giving away an iPad and a
crapload of makeup and my giveaway so be
sure to enter that I'll link it down
below um I don't have any announcements
though let's just do it okay guys
jumping right in I'm gonna go in with
Peach Smoothie as usual by makeup beacon
8.40 brush I'm going to blend this all
over the lid all the way up to the brow
bone this is just gonna help lighten up
our eye primer and make everything more
subdued then I'll go in with creme
brulee which is my favorite crease color
and I'll build this up in the upper
crease area I'm using an e25 brush from
Sigma this is my all-time favorite brush
it blends so nicely and fits right into
that socket of the eye and allows me to
blend out the crease and make it nice
soft and a gradient then I will go in
with a mocha by makeup geek and I'm
actually in a target more so the outer
corner of the eye and then slowly bring
it up into the crease I do work with a
very small amount of color and then I
just build it up rather than going in
with a fully loaded brush because that
can be a disaster so be careful with
those dark colors because they can be
sneaky and it can ruin your eye look
then I'll go back in with the e-40 and
blend everything out next I'm going in
with expresso by Mac this is my favorite
dark brown eye shadow and I'm just gonna
focus this right into the crease to
deepen it up a little bit more because
Moakley just wasn't making it dark
enough for me so I'm just gonna build
that up placing it in the exact same
area the outer V and then building it up
into the crease now I'll go in with one
of my favorite shades from makeup geek
this is a bitten and I'm gonna pack this
on cut into the outer half of my eyelid
this is gonna start giving us that nice
smoky cranberry feel and I'm just
blend it forward a little bit again I'm
using the same e 25 brush then I will go
in with corrupt which is an awesome
matte black eyeshadow shade from makeup
geek and I just wanted to darken it up
just a little bit more if we're gonna do
smoky we need to commit to it so hand it
up going in with this black shade and
blending it on top of Express though
with the e25 brush I use this brush all
throughout the tutorial next I'm going
in with I pallet polish by pure and you
can use this stuff as an eyeshadow base
on top of your eyeshadow or wear it
alone I'm gonna use it as a base this
was my first time using it and I did a
little like it it's gonna enhance the
cranberry look because we're gonna go in
right on top of this with Showtime this
is a foiled eyeshadow by makeup geek and
I'm going to pack that right on top of
that I polished by pure just to enhance
the cranberry look oh it looks so pretty
then I'm gonna smooth out that harsh
line right there with the e25 brush I
don't have any eyeshadow on it I'm just
molding it out then I'm gonna go in with
a light shimmery shade pop shimma shimma
by make a peak and I'm gonna blend this
on the brow bone to tie everything
together next going in with my morphe
black gel liner in this little tart
liner brush that I am still trying to
make work for me and I struggled a
little bit with it still so I'm going in
with my NYC black liquid liner I'm just
gonna go over the top of the morphe
liner to darken it up and I get a little
bit more of a precise sharp line then I
will clean up any of the excess that's
hanging out there and we're gonna add a
few coats of mascara if you don't want
to wear false lashes I would build up
your lashes at this point but I'm going
to pop on the falsies these are smoking
muse but half lashes these are new
lashes and I've worn them like every day
of the week I love them so much
arty did my foundation and my primer and
I actually went back to the Mac Studio
Fix what
I don't know I love it again so then I'm
gonna go in and highlight the face a
little bit of my NARS creamy radiant
concealer and custard and I'm gonna
blend that out really patting it out
trying not to move the product around
too much and keeping it in place but at
the same time I'm blending it out and I
will set basically my entire face with
the Laura Mercier translucent powder
next I will go in with this Bobbi Brown
Foundation stick I believe this is a
warm almond I'll have everything linked
down below as usual and I am going to
contour my face so I'm just gonna hit
the temples the nose and the cheekbone
area and maybe a little on the chin I'm
gonna take this brush from makeup
addiction I'm going to blend out the
contour this is a little bit more of a
time-consuming part so if you just want
to add bronzer on this part by all means
that make this tutorial your own can we
look at that piece of hair shooting
straight up in the sky oh my gosh then
I'm going in with my favorite fall time
blush this is breezy by Mac it is super
pigmented so go in with a light hand but
I'm gonna pop that onto the apples of
the cheeks oh my god I got oh darling by
Mac and they're they're so pretty
if you follow me on snapchat you already
know I found they dupe for it if you
couldn't get your hands on it but as for
me I'm gonna be wearing it in the stew
room cause it's dope then I'm gonna go
in with a little bit of cocoa bear up by
makeup geek this is just a warm brown
eyeshadow and I'm blend this on the
lower lash line and then with a flat
definer brush I'm just gonna pop a
little bit of corrupt right at the lash
line just smoke it down a little bit
then I will blend all that out with a
e25 brush that is clean next with my
Marc Jacobs pencil liner I'm going to
fill in the waterline to make it nice
and dark and then I'm gonna add a few
coats of mascara to those lower lashes
using the benefit roller lash mascara
next as far as lips goes I'm going in
with my favorite lip liner by Mac which
is stripped down it is such a nice warm
nude tan color and then I'm gonna
actually go in with myth by Mac which is
like this whiteout nude color but we're
gonna blend it out with the lip liner
it's gonna turn out really pretty and
then I'm gonna go in with midi by color
pop this is a liquid lipstick and I'm
gonna pop that right on top and then
right here is where we're gonna blend
the colors together and make it look
nice and soften gradient that way my
lips aren't just like whiteout nude then
we will set everything today I'm gonna
be using a little bit of my urban decay
setting spray spritz spritz spritz and
we are done hope you guys enjoyed this
