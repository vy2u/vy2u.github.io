hey guys I'm welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be you guesses
a wedding day makeup tutorial I promise
you guys a wedding day makeup tutorial
for a year now and I'm just now
producing best thing about this wedding
day makeup Zoro is the fact that it's
all drugstore oh yes ma'am super
affordable makeup I've been
experimenting with new drugstore
products because the drugstore has been
coming out with all kinds of amazing new
products I've also specifically picked
products that are great for your wedding
day
not just good drugstore products in
general but good drugstore products that
are great for your big day I'm going to
tell you why I'm using them and how
they're gonna be great for your big day
and just tips and tricks throughout the
video I hope you guys enjoyed please
give me a thumbs up if you do makeup
look that we're creating today it's
going to be soft timeless classic you're
gonna look back on your wedding day
pictures in 20 years and be like I still
love that makeup look and that's what I
was kind of going for with this um it
was really hard for me not to wing it
out I didn't wing it out guys I'm so
excited for you guys to see it and if
you're interested in getting ready for
this tutorial well then just keep
watching for conceal are going to be
using my instant age rewind concealer
and what I'm gonna do when I get a
little bit of this on my finger you can
use whichever concealer and I'm going to
prime my eyelids with it highly highly
recommend prime me your eyelids this is
going to make all the difference in the
world with your eyeshadow so basically
I'm just dabbing and priming my Milani
makes an excellent actual eyeshadow
primer if you want to use that instead
you're going in with this Neutrogena
this is their long wearing eyeshadows
which is definitely going to help with a
wedding day so your makeup doesn't fade
I'm just going to go in with this
neutral shade right here in a fluffy
brush it's going to blend this literally
all over the whole entire lid and this
is going to soften up that concealer as
our primer and make every color more
manageable and easy to blend out
I go in with this L'Oreal new to palette
new to palette I grab this topi gray
shade with this little short blending
brush what I'm going to do is I'm going
to start blending it on the outer corner
right there small circular motions and
you want to take your time with the
eyeshadow you don't want to be rushed
because the more you blend the more you
take your time the software and more
gradient the look is going to up here
I'm gonna grab this cool toned brown
color right here and just get a little
bit on one into my brush I'm gonna take
the end of the brush and I'm just going
to place that in the outer crease right
there just going back and forth put a
shoot the brush in the crease and softly
going back and forth my goal right now
is to open up that outer edge of the eye
and make the eyes look they're wider on
the outer corner which is going to look
absolutely gorgeous in pictures also you
don't want to be bringing this color all
the way up to your brow bone you want to
stay right below your brow bone but you
don't want to keep it in too close and
too packed you want to make sure it just
looks really soft and gradient coming
out I've done that I can see a little
bit of harshness right through here so
I'm going to take a clean brush and I'm
just going to soften that up a little
bit because you remember you want
everything to be as soft as possible
the shell wedding-day go but of this
brown cool tone color right here a
little bit of a deeper brown on this Pat
blending brush and I'm legit just going
to like push it as you can see I mean a
little bit of color and I'm going to
push it right in the outer beat only
being sure not to take it in too far I'm
gonna take a clean blending brush and
I'm just going to go right here and
swipe very softly because we definitely
have to soften that up we just placed
the color and now we want to blend it
out and soften it up and make sure it
looks really soft and gradient how many
times is she gonna say soften gradient I
don't know I'm gonna pick up a little
bit of more of that brown color with
this brush and build it up right
only focusing the color on the outer V
area if a little bit is giving in that
inner corner area right here that's okay
we'll be able to cover that up but you
definitely don't get very much shadow at
all over there because I'm kind of
stopping right here to manually focus on
the outer B to make sure we're widening
in widening the outer corner of the eye
and back to the nourishing loanword
palette by Neutrogena by the way this
one is in classic nude I'm going to grab
just a teeny tiny bit of this dark dark
brown color which reminds me so much of
expresso by Mac I think it's a total
dupe for it I'm gonna take this teeny
tiny brush right here that way we can
get really precise with our placement
it's gonna place it on the outer corner
again we're still building up color the
more colors you add on and build up the
softer and more gradient it's going to
look rather than you just going in with
one dark shade for the outer corner and
one light shade for the inner corner so
going in with a clean blending brush
just soften that outer corner up I'm
going to grab the lightest shade which
is a light shimmery shade right here
with a synthetic flat brush I'm going to
very lightly place this in that inner
corner this color is absolutely gorgeous
for a bridal look um it has like the
teeny tiniest light a bit of pink hue to
it so it's not a white shimmery
eyeshadow that you're placing on your
eye it actually has a little bit of
color to it and it is so beautiful light
shimmery but it's not too shimmery again
going in with a clean or semi clean
brush pretty much clean brush I'm going
to grab this and I'm just going to
soften up everything one more time let's
finish with the eyes I'm going to grab a
little bit more of this light color that
we used on our lid with this teeny tiny
brush that came with the palette and I'm
just
going to very light handedly apply this
to the brow bone don't want to add too
much color to your brow bone especially
on your wedding day when you're going to
be taking pictures because if the flash
picks up this area it can make it look
super white really awkward really weird
so I'm spreading out a little bit of
color because a little bit goes a long
way you don't want to go too shimmery I
don't understand why this brow hair has
to be weird like why can't you just stay
up I go in with a little bit of this
Lauria oh really and with a little bit
of this L'Oreal smoldering liner and I'm
actually going to get a little bit on my
brush that way can be a bit more precise
with it a wedding day I didn't wing it
out so I'm not gonna wing it out here
I'm just scared to death in my look back
in 20 years and say what the hell was I
doing with winged eyeliner so I just
define the eyes with it
you
it here is I went out just a little bit
wider towards the outer V and then the
closer I brought it in the line got
thinner that way again we're still
opening up the eyes on the outer edge
our step when working on your face for
your Bridal makeup I highly highly
highly recommend priming your skin I'm
going to be using this shine control
primer by Neutrogena which is great for
a wedding day it has no sunscreen in it
is moisturizing at the same time it's
going to keep your face matte without
over-drying your skin and it's going to
smooth out your face it's going to blend
this right through here areas that need
it a little bit more smoothing out you
can apply this to your whole entire face
if you want to I'm also going to apply
some to the forehead area because I get
a little bit greasy especially when I
get hot like this area just goes crazy
on me next I'm going to be applying my
foundation today I'm going to be using
this Neutrogena shine control foundation
and it has a low Fiat SPF in it the
reason I'm going to be using it is
because number one it's shine control
apply this so same way I always apply my
foundations and I'm just going to do it
on the face I'm gonna go in with an
angled brush and I'm going to Pat that
out I have a full foundation routine if
you guys want to watch that video but
what I like to start the center of the
face and then work outward kind of like
a like a Sun or star you know blended
outward video dabbing motions and not be
- streaky with it that way we avoid
having brush strokes in our foundation
um but you can't blend it out and then
you can go back and kind of dab it and
get that airbrushed finish we're going
to be taking side pictures you're going
to want to make sure to get this area
bring it all into the hair the ear blend
it down the neck I'm going to be going
in with this maybelline superstay better
skin concealer this concealer
hat is oil-free which is very important
especially on our wedding day and it has
a color corrector in it so it's gonna oh
it's so hard to open going to create
correct darkness and I have a little
blemish my cheatin gzs what a small
amount I did so I'm going to apply that
there a little bit on the under eye area
I'm not really gonna
I like my whole face I'm gonna do like
the minimal because I don't want my face
to look like it as a hard highlight on
it weddings are normally during the day
and you're in a lot of light and people
can see if you do that so you really
want to go with a really light highlight
if you do so like look how little I put
on my forehead all right so I'm going
back in with that kabuki brush and I'm
gonna dab this out I'm just going to
smooth this out and give it an airbrush
finish it make it look super soft under
the eyes it's going to brighten your
eyes to make you look nice awake fresh
flawless skin yes go I'm just going to
dab that out over that blemish which
covered the blemish really well as far
as this area over here I'm going to
bring it out you don't want to like push
it into your eye shadow so be really
careful with that I'm just literally
going to dab it around the eye shadow
now you can see my face you can see
everything is just airbrush you can't
see where the concealer starts and stops
with the foundation my under eye areas
looks bright no dark circles but it's
not to highlight it in too harsh it's
just a good mix setting your makeup is
going to make it last longer than
anything that you do with your makeup so
be sure to set your makeup the
Neutrogena shine control powder with a
rice protein complex in it is going to
mattify set the face make your makeup
last longer and number one thing it
doesn't have sunscreen in it doesn't
have reflecting light in it so it's not
going to flash back with the camera this
right onto that concealer so I really
want it to hardcore set that concealer
and I'm just going to kind of blend it
around my face
the makeup artist on hand or your best
friend you know that Brides may make
sure she has this on hand with her with
a little brush in between pictures do a
little touch-up with it and that way
your face stays nice flawless and meta
fired now I'm going to contour the pace
I'm going to do a light powder contour
versus a cream contour because the cream
contour can be a little bit more harsh
and again in the daylight and stuff you
can see those sharp lines where you've
come to your face you want this to look
a little bit more soft and natural but
you do want to contour that way it shows
up in your pictures and your face looks
nice and structured so I'm going to go
in with this NYX palette I'm just gonna
grab this cool tone matte brown color
you can use any you know matte bronzer
that you have but you don't want it to
be too warm tome because it can really
pick it up make it kind of oranjee on
your skin's you got to be careful with
that I start the hairline I'm going to
blend down I'm using a medium sized
brush here this this is extremely
pigmented like that's way too much color
so need to soften that up a little bit
but I'm going to bring it down you don't
to bring it down too much who kind of
make you like you have a 5 o'clock
shadow going on but you do want to bring
it down a little bit and I'm going to
softly blend this you want to make sure
you're not pulling the shade down
because again you're going to get that 5
o'clock shadow weirdness I highly
recommend practicing your makeup before
your wedding day make sure to blend this
into my hairline if you have blond hair
you might want to be more careful with
doing this I mean you might want to use
a lighter shade bronzer that way it
doesn't show up in your hairline I'm
going to blend it in my hairline and I'm
going to hit the temples areas you have
to remember to kind of keep the keep a
flow going with the bronzer I'm going to
hit the tables because the Sun naturally
hits your temple area so you don't want
like a white forehead in this structure
cheekbone you want to keep like the flow
going everything looking soft and
somewhat natural I'm going to add some
blush just to give us a little bit of a
flush to the cheeks i'm going in with
rosy by Neutrogena this shade is
beautiful shape for majority of people
it doesn't have too much shimmer in it
so you're not going to have like a big
shimmery sparkly phone so it's like that
great in-between blush I'm just going to
pop this on right to the apples of my
cheeks make sure not to bring it up too
high not sure
too low right on the apples and blend
backwards that way you have that natural
flush on your cheekbone area next I'm
gonna be highlighting my face I'm going
to avoid any white looking highlight
again you just want that healthy
hopefully natural glow you don't want to
look like a cyclops you purposely placed
a highlight there you want somewhat of a
natural look I'm going to go in with
this true Lumi liquid highlighter glow
this one is in rows like this to the
high points of the cheekbone with a very
light hand
I'm going to go in and contour my nose a
little bit that way everything flows and
I don't have a nose that just has
absolutely no bronzer on it you don't
have to contour if you don't want to but
I like to do it just to make sure
everything's flowing I'm going to add
just a little bit to the Cupid's bow as
well we're going to finish up the eye
area I'm going to grab this cool tone
brown color and it on to an angled brush
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna start
on this outer corner I'm going to bring
it inward take this little dome shape
brush and I'm going to go back to my
Neutrogena palette and just grab that
neutral shade and I'm just going to
blend it right underneath just to soften
everything up cleaner grab the color we
used on our eyelid and our brow bone and
I'm just going to place that in the
inner corner this is going to open up
the eyes up this is my favorite part and
I'm just going to bring it right here to
the tear duct area and stop right there
I'm going to just grab a little bit of
that l'oreal smoldering liner on this
brush and i'm going to fill in my
waterline i feel like whenever you pack
it on with a brush it lasts a little bit
longer and again the waterline is like
it always goes first so i like to do
that another tip is you can warm up that
line on the back of your hand that way
it comes off way easier stop right here
because I feel like whenever I bring my
liner in all the way in the inner corner
is it can start to run because that's
right by your tear duct and normally
never wear waterproof mascara but
there's any good day to wear waterproof
mascara it's going to be your wedding
day so I'm going in with the Neutrogena
healthy volume waterproof mascara
you know holds those tears and girls and
I'm going to build this up a little bit
but I am going to add false lashes you
definitely don't have to if you're not
comfortable with false lashes
I love the ardell demi whispies and I
like to cut them up into three separate
pieces I grab the outer edge which is
the biggest piece and I like to place it
in the center of my lid like that I'm
using to do a lash adhesive in black
which is a drugstore lash adhesive just
grab a tweezer dab a little bit of the
lash glue you can let it dry for a few
seconds if you want place again the
biggest piece right in the center it's
smaller Stockholm you can set them right
beside each other tourist lips going to
go in with this Jordana lip liner and
Hani get this at Walgreens it cost like
2 bucks it's a really good neutral lip
color so it's not going to nude out your
lips but it's not going to be like too
harsh of a color and I fill in the whole
entire lip with this
literally just finished off this like
it's completely empty now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
