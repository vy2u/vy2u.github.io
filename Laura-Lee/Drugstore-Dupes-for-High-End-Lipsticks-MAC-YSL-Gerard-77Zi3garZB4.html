all over my back now hey guys welcome to
my channel so first I think we'll
address the big elephant in the room my
hair I definitely did a big change on my
hair I was just so tired of having long
grunt brah oh I was just so tired of
having long brown hair I've had long
brown hair my whole life and never dyed
my hair I just went to the salon not
like let's some brain my hair it's more
darker in the back um
and then up front we have like lots of
lighter pieces to come up higher so when
you look at me straight on it almost
looks like I just helped on here but
it's on brain and then I have a little
bit of darkness through here I do have
my extensions coming in the mail oh
because I definitely had to get new ones
and I'm excited to try those out my hair
but I don't know it's such a big change
for me but I like it I'm happy with it
and let me know what you guys think
about the fro the new hairdo ah today's
video is going to be another Duke video
and it's not just gonna involve mac
lipsticks this time it's gonna involve a
lot of different high in bred lipsticks
we have YSL we do have mac we have a
lorac and Kat Von D just high-end
lipsticks that I found dupes for and
again I found perfect dupes for them
that are so so so so cheap so I'm very
excited to share them with you guys I
know you're gonna love them I'm actually
wearing one of the dupes right now so
I'm very excited to share them with you
guys I worked all morning on finding
these dupes I have my hands painted and
lipsticks and I have used like a hundred
of my little white East cleaning myself
if you saw my makeup this right now you
would faint there's it's horrible I
could barely get ready who work was well
worth it because we have more dupes and
if you're excited about seeing these
dupes will then please just keep
watching
the first tip I want to talk about is
rebel by Matt this is a super popular
color I think like almost everybody
loves rebel and my packaging is a little
bit different because I did get this one
in the heirloom mixed collection for the
holidays but again it's just rebel and
this is a beautiful purpley color and I
found an exact match for rebel so this
is wine and dine this is a high voltage
lipstick by NYX and these little
mamajamas
they just match perfectly and I'm so
obsessed with them I didn't even realize
I had a match in my collection I
probably want a bowl rebel if I knew but
I didn't have this one yet I already had
rebels so that worked out for the exact
same don't go spend money on rebel or if
you can't find rebel because I know it's
sold out all the time don't panic just
go get wine and dine by next this is a
high-voltage little bit sticky then next
to is this is lorac alter-ego lipstick
and this one is in sex kitten and this
is a Holy Grail product for springtime
everybody needs a beautiful Bowl pink to
wear it for all spring months which I
know it's still snowing in places which
just baffles me because it's just sunny
all year round here and even when I
lived in Alabama it doesn't really snow
there so what does that even mean guys
survive in the snow I know I couldn't
anyways back to lipsticks sex kitten by
lorac and then we have Jordan as modern
matte lipstick this one isn't that
popular now the tricky thing about these
are they actually don't look alike in
the packaging but I find that the Jordan
and modern matte lipsticks they come off
a little bit different than what they
actually look like in the package so
with that being said it came off more so
looking like the lorac alter ego and
they're a beautiful perfect match and
they're both matte lipsticks so they
even have that same texture yes girl my
next tip is the one that I'm most
excited about because I love this color
I know a lot of people don't want to
wear bright orange lipstick this is Kat
they study lipstick in a go-go and this
is just um orange I don't know how else
to describe it other than like orange I
did find a perfect dupe for it this is
the high voltage by mix again lipstick
and then this one is in free spirit so
the only slight difference I found was
free spirit by NYX was just like or
shiny rather than the Kat Von D because
most of it or like all the Kat Von D's
are really leaning towards a matte
lipstick but their dupes they really
they just look just alike they're so
awesome and these are a little bit
expensive they're like 21 I think I may
be wrong I'll look but I think it's
really 21 so this is a super good dupe
for this
I did find a job I did kind of do poor
Gerard's berry smoothie this is Gerard's
brand-new lipstick that just came out
and I'm very excited about it but it I
didn't realize how close it is to touch
a spice and I know a lot of people were
like touch of spice is the perfect duper
Jaclyn hills 1995 I'm girlfriend it is
not it is a perfect dupe for berry
smoothie if you swipe 1995 and then this
touch of spice on your hands there is a
bit of its color difference I mean they
are very similar but they're not exact
and I found it very smoothie and has
your spies are exact and they're both
matte so that again they had that same
texture this is its twin sister but one
is a little bit more pricey yeah they're
now friends because of the exact same
color most expensive and cheapest dupe I
have um my favorite like nude lipstick
this is YSL's Ruge pur Couture and in
Britain I feel like whenever you read
why it sells lipstick and Titleist you
need to say I'm like that well uh uh
overpriced lipstick so I do love this
lipstick though it is pretty awesome I'm
not gonna lie but I did want to do so
you ain't gonna go out and spend $35 on
one lipstick oh but Jim is actually a
Jordan lipstick and it's a modern matte
and then this
isn't matte blush and this is number Oh
- and they're the exact same I really
wanted to kind of do for this one just
because it's my most expensive lipstick
that I own so I was like challenge
accepted I mean it's just a nude
lipstick people just hype things up like
I'm hyping this up right now because I
love it I mean you don't have to go out
and spend all your money it's not
necessary
go get friggin matte blush and be like
hey yo I got my root pur Couture on okay
no one would be able to tell the
difference
lastly have my last nude how many nudes
to do so only get two nudes
I love nude lipsticks Mac's blankety it
is like a weird new nude color because
it's so Mabi
and I really love this color and I found
a NYX high voltage lipstick I'm sorry a
lot of these dupes or the NYX high
voltage but these are just awesome this
one is in stone but these I mean I
immediately knew it was a dupe they
freaking look just alike they are the
exact same they had that same amplified
color in the same high shine to them
they the same thang girl don't be fooled
just need your next stone which is so
amazing because I love this color a lot
and it's been neglected and now I feel
like I'm just gonna use my next stone I
love these are so moisturizing and as I
preach to you guys I got the crappiest
lips on this side of California so this
these are awesome for that you have dry
lips go for the UM high-voltage
lipsticks by NYX they are gonna be your
Holy Grail um yeah that's that's all my
dues but if you guys want me to feel
more nude videos involving other things
than lipsticks maybe lip glosses blush
bronzers powders I don't know I can come
up with a man I just gonna do a little
bit of research but I can come up with
