video is going to be a drugstore dupes
video I have done my homework and I
found a lot of amazing drugstore dupes
for really popular high-end products can
I wait to share them with you guys I
myself I was like oh my gosh oh my gosh
this is a total dupe and I had it the
whole time it's so crazy I want to let
you know that a one of my main focuses
in this video was not just the color
being a dupe it was the texture and the
formula of the product being super
similar because I know that is very
important whenever we're duping products
I do have two products that are not
drugstore dupes but they are dudes I'm
gonna share them with you anyways cuz
we're doing a dupe video but the rest
are total drugstore dupes
I hope you're excited give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoy and let's jump
right in
first I'll share with you the one that
is not drugstore dupe is oh darling by
Mac you basically almost can't get it
anymore and the dupe is another really
popular it's by Laura Geller it's called
gilded honey I did actually go into Mac
at lunchtime today came out and they're
like you know we have it in stock I was
like oh of course
I got one and I was looking at it and I
was like pretty sure I have a
highlighter or more that are very very
similar so I mainly started swatching
just from my own curiosity and gilded
honey was none other but a total dupe so
if you were not able to get oh darling
gilded honey is where it's at I think
you'll get honey in the packaging looks
a little bit darker than oh darling but
reality is whenever I swatch them you
can add up the difference this one might
just be a little bit more compacted I
don't know but the point is when you
apply them to your cheek whoo girl you
see that highlight you can't tell the
difference an X tube is the tart in a
realm liner now this is a super popular
product used on the waterline to widen
the eyes as a super long-lasting formula
and it is kind of a nudie color now this
pens will cost 21 dollars that is hard
to justify for a liner just to put in
your waterline alone like that's really
hard to justify there was a liner they
went on top and bottom you can smoke out
etc maybe so but $21 is really pricey
for a waterline this is the Rimmel
exaggerate and this is their waterproof
liner and I use this in my waterline and
if you swatch on your hand the colors
are super super similar they're almost
identical and it lasts for a long time
because it's waterproof so you get that
long-lasting quality as well as you do
in the Tarte in a room liner I believe
this one's around 5 bucks this one's 21
bucks from now on I'll definitely be
buying the Rimmel liner for my waterline
because I can't even justify buying this
anymore the anti interesting dupe for me
a foundation powder and it's actually a
dupe in texture and in color so first we
have the Make Up For Ever foundation
powder and now they do have new
packaging for this as you believe mine
is just in a little
older packaging but this is Che 203
hello love their foundation powder it is
amazing it sets so well on the skin it
makes a skill skin look velvety soft and
it does really great coverage another
one that I have really been adoring is
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
ah this is Shea 220 and this is 203 the
shades are pretty much identical and the
texture and formula of the product are
the exact same like literally the same I
love the quality in the texture and I
love the coverage that you get from this
one this is always been one of my
favorite drugstore foundation powders
again it makes the skin look super
velvety and soft and smooth and even oh
the matte and poreless line to me by
Maybelline it's just all that and a bag
of chips X we'll talk about a concealer
so the mac prolongwear concealer a lot
of people's Holy Grail for good reasons
but now I have to admit that the NYX HD
concealer has the exact same quality and
coverage colours are not similar I've
looked for like NC 30 in the NYX one and
they just don't provide that color
however I do wear cwo for beige which is
just a little bit lighter i I love them
both I think they both have an amazing
quality I think they're long lasting
somewhat creaseless if you set them
correctly and they just remind me so
much of each other we recommended to
everybody out there if you're at Ulta
pick up one you will not regret I have
two facial primers they remind me
incredibly amount of each other it's
just insane how much this remind me of
each other first we have the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer now this
one is one of those silicone II based
primers it's meant to smooth out the
skin fill in the pores or any unwanted
areas the shine killer by NYX is
actually a complete dupe now I do these
out by testing it on one half of my face
this one I don't remember I just tested
each one on one half my fake face I
couldn't tell the difference they work
the exact same there was a silicone
based primer you can even rub them on
your hand together and they look the
exact same even though this one is pinky
once you rub it out they look the exact
same and not only that they feel
identical to one another
Oh total Dubnyk shine killer and the
smashbox photo ready more exciting dupes
happening purse is the makeup forever
step one now this is their nourishing
primer and what is the weird thing that
i think it's just a complete and total
dupe is the master Prime at maybelline
now they have a nourishing one but it's
actually the blur and smooth one that
reminds me so much of the makeup forever
nourishing primer my super dry days i
always pick up the nourishing one just
to help my skin out but a little bit
more moisture however i notice that the
master prime i definitely don't use this
one all the time because I have to hire
in one sitting there so I just opted for
it typically but I have worn this one a
lot and it does the exact same thing it
nourishes your skin so much and again if
you rub them on your hand separately you
will feel the exact same texture out of
both of them so I really awesome do but
I know you guys will be so happy to find
out about this is trash issues by honest
Asha Beverly Hill on saucy honest Asia
tomato tomato
peas and carrots when you can't really
even get any more I don't believe and
every time I wear it I feel so guilty
because I don't think your canoed but I
did like crazy amounts of swatches of
liquid lipsticks in NYX suede lippies
this is a vintage they look pretty much
identical however I will let you know
this one it takes a lot longer to dry
than trust issues but honest Asha boo
there is a slight difference in formula
however the end result and color are
identical or these are selling like
hotcakes
so good looking good look and finding it
I will look for it online and linking
down below AB the super popular opal by
Becca cosmetics which is one of the most
beautiful highlighters the poured one
therefore it's like a cream to powder
highlight I really do for is a drugstore
dude this is my flower beauty which is
Drew Barrymore's a makeup line sold at
Walmart they're both gonna be a cream
texture and they look identical on and
even the text room is the exact same
I've had this one for ever and I just
started playing around my highlighters
washed and I'm trying to pens and dupes
and I was just like Oh Eureka and my
last tip I wanted to mention really
quickly is the contour sponge and the
Beauty Blender I like the contour sponge
it better than the Beauty Blender
because I think it actually gets softer
then the Beauty Blender and it blends
out so well they both have that nice
when it tipped but this one has another
advantage it has like a slice on the
side which is great for applying powder
to sharpen up that contour or flip it up
and you can actually blend out your
contour with it so this one even has
more uses it's a little bit gimmicky but
it's $10.99 this is $20 so came to me in
the melon a random package and I looked
it up what it was and it's the contour
sponge and then in a video I didn't know
what it was a lot of you guys were
saying it's the real techniques but it's
not that one's actually orange not
yellow it is the contour sponge that is
it for this video I hope you liked it
thank you so much for coming by my
channel and watching I'll see you all in
my next video and if you stay till the
end of the video my lip color is Bieber
by colour-pop
