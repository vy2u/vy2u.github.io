today's video is going to be a drugstore
haul yes it's actually been a really
long time since I've been to the drums
when actually like went shopping and
they have came out with so many new
stuff I was just like well where have I
been so I definitely picked up a lot of
the new stuff I'm going to be trying out
I went to Target and get a load of stuff
for a particular it's just for you I'm
going to be coming for you guys so yeah
I'm gonna be hiding and I did buy some
stuff from Ulta but I only shop at the
drugstore section so no high-end
products in here
where you can jump right in and get
started and I'm gonna share all my
little dudes from the drugstore we see
you in the first part that I got that I
was most excited about was the Lummi and
the True Match Lumi liquid glow
Luminator so I feel like the drugstore
is 110 percent slacking on their
highlight selection and I feel like
loriel just picked up that's why I have
been wanting shreddy so bad and they're
actually kind of difficult time but
Holda had them and actually out for all
40% off because that 40% off olds are
L'Oreal at that time yeah I was pretty
excited I was like freaking out I was
like oh my god give me everything
L'Oreal oh yeah all three of them of
course I'm very excited about them but I
got the golden the ice and the rose my
personal favorite right now is the rose
one the ice one is a little bit light
for me right now like it would be a
little bit of a strong highlight for me
and then the bronze is just super golden
goddess bronze
love it um I'm talking like a man a
little bit I feel like I am anyways
because I just woke up and I'm filming
early oh these are amazing I've already
used the Rose one and I'm very excited
about it because it was so pretty oh I'm
gonna be using a men's tutorial so you
guys can see don't worry you know I got
you with that you guys already know
about these highlighter and power
you guys know I would not be slacking
like that so again there were 40 percent
off which that's a hell of a good deal
so I got all three of them again and
they have the powders that match the
liquid loominator so the first one I got
where's the neighbor boom who the ice
ones for those of you who have a really
cool undertone and then they have the
warm undertone with just the bronzy one
and then they have the rosy one that has
that neutral undertone I feel like a
manuchehr undertone I'll probably be
wearing all three of these because you
know I'm gonna break those rules but I
could play with these highlighters
they're beautiful they don't compare to
like Beca highlighters or anything like
that they're way more dry in the formula
I think they're way more dry in the
formula but they do their job and they
luminate the face and it is cute oh also
I thought while filming a drugstore
video I would share with you these
little razors
I like these razors to have three blades
they have a conditioning strip and they
have a rubber strip for protection these
razors are from 99 cent razor calm so
it's gonna be a lot cheaper than buying
them from the drugstore
if you don't know like if you're gonna
like we're not you can get a free trial
you just have to pay two ninety-five for
the shipping handling and they'll send
you 2 razors after you're done with like
a two-week trial obscene if you like run
on how they shave your little hairy here
so it's your subscription with them
begins but you get to customize it and
pick like how often you won't razors
sent to you normally get five razors per
packet based six ninety-five a month
plus free shipping anyways the next new
product I got from the drugstore I'm
really excited to try this one out this
is the superstay better skin foundation
by L'Oreal I got shade natural beige
which I'm kind of feeling might be a
little bit too dark for me I haven't
tried to know yet
I haven't pumped it out yet I have no
idea about this foundation I don't know
what it's supposed to do I'm gonna read
up on it I'm gonna be trying it out very
excited about it
I love Maybelline a little Oreo I love
the drugstore you guys know that but I'm
really excited about their new
foundation because I've had a really
good run with my
foundations in the past so you better be
good and of course I bought the matching
concealer I'm also a concealer junkie as
am i a foundation junkie oh I got the
better skin Foundation which has a
corrector in it I've already tried this
concealer and yes I love it I think this
is an awesome concealer I got the shade
light/medium I think they had a shade
lighter than this which I have a
horrible habit of just grabbing the
lightest shade and rolling with it but I
was like ah all right
let's become a shade that actually works
for you so I went with light/medium
because I didn't want it to be too light
and like that too much of a highlighted
look extra tricks - I bought another
foundation oh I know okay I got the True
Match Lumi healthy luminous makeup
foundation it says new on the bottle I
don't think this is new and believe it
or not I've never tried this foundation
I know
Oh Margot you like together I think it's
been out for a long time I think they
just stick new on the stuff at the
drugstore because they like want it to
be a marketing game we know it's not I
think I got a really good shade in this
I've never worn it before so I wasn't
honestly sure what shade to get but I
got true beige which is in five I feel
like I've heard people rave about this
one before and yeah I just missed the
fun bus on it so here I am I'm on the
late bus now baby packs I picked up a
tried-and-true product that I haven't
used in a long time at the NYX HD
concealer this was my holy girl
concealer like right whenever like mom
was in college this was like my go-to
it's affordable concealer and it's an
amazing concealer and I found a good
shade the shade that I used back in the
day
okay okay wasn't that long ago you see
wo4 beige and they had it there and I
was like well don't mind if I do this
was 40% off - so that made this like
almost nothing was like $2 of change the
only thing I hate about these is I feel
like they run out like after three uses
I don't know why probably because I use
half the bottle and three uses which is
ridiculous but that's just the way I
feel about it you know that made an oh
and I bought the wrong show
coming I wanted this wonder stick for I
don't know forever and I always told out
of my Ulta and when I saw it of course I
got really excited about it and I
snatched it up and threw my bag didn't
even look at it and I got the deep
profound color which is I think it'd be
way too dark for me oh girl look at
makeup Shayla Hey Girl hey we see is an
awesome Instagram if you guys aren't
following makeup Shayla her makeup I'm
probably gonna have to return this and
hopefully they'll have the one that's my
shade that is all that I got from Ulta
then I actually just got a bunch of
Neutrogena stuff and not just Neutrogena
stuff that some other stuff to you from
well yeah so basically I just got a
buncha Neutrogena stuff from RJ the
first thing I got is calm down I'm
saying I guys these futures you know
white bees answer makeup remover wipes
and I love these and I make it wipes
come and I'm a bum home but I wanted
some more because I knew I love these
and I saw him there and all let me get
back to let me get back to the good
stuff I pulled another foundation okay I
bought this foundation for a particular
tutorial that I'm gonna be filming for
you guys and that's why I bought it okay
this is the Neutrogena shine control
makeup I like this foundation I used it
back when I worked at the dermatologist
because Neutrogena reps would come in
all the time and give me free stuff and
I'd like that's how I got introduced to
it but I remembered how much I loved it
and I saw it sitting there and it was
calling my name and it was saying Laura
take me home with you I did you know
about another product which was 4 which
is for a tutorial so this is the shine
control this is a shine control powder
by nu J Gina and it has the rice protein
complex in it and basically it's gonna
help avoid the shininess without over
drawing your skin or over mattifying
your skin and it doesn't flash back with
a camera and the flash you know you get
the crazy whiteness you're not gonna get
that with this this is a really great
powder I've used it in the past I just
don't have it anymore and honest
I just want it again because I wanted a
good drugstore uh you know setting
powder hello-o next I got something that
I'm really excited about getting I'm
gonna lie I was pretty hesitant on
buying this palette because I feel like
I have a little bit of an overflow and
that makeup palette world and this was
twenty dollars at the drugstore so I was
like hey you know Ana's another neutral
palette at the end of the day one can
not have too many neutral palettes am i
right okay I'm right
picked up the one in number two which
has a little bit more color to it has
like these purpley shades to it it's a
really pretty palette like the shades
and a lot I think this is an amazing
drugstore makeup palette I think if
you're struggling with your drug swear
eyeshadows or you're looking for
something new that's gonna be an awesome
palette for you however just know this
is not an Urban Decay Naked palette like
it's not I don't think the colored
necessarily compare because once I
started blending them out I noted that
they were basically fading into nothing
as far as the color pigmentation but an
actual hard swatch of them they showed
up I mean the dang things 19 bucks are
cheaper and your Naked palette is 54 so
you're getting it for less than half the
price but the colors just don't blend
out quite like in Urban Decay Naked
palette just thought I would compare
with the Urban Decay Naked palette
because I mean they're kind of similar
kind of yeah one of the 18 naked
palettes ex products I got because I
love her facial primers I always have
went on before I do my foundation is the
Neutrogena shine control primer it also
has the rice protein complex in it so
it's gonna help mattify your skin
without over-drying your skin this is
gonna be bomb calm I can't wait to use
it
and I'm really excited about it I got
the Neutrogena and held it okay I like
toe of section I got the Neutrogena
healthy volume waterproof mascara
I don't wear waterproof mascara because
I feel like your rips out my lashes cuz
I can't ever get it off not even will
make it remember it's so annoying and I
hate it but I got it because of the
tutorial I'm gonna film a lot of blushes
but not a lot from the drugstore and I
feel like the drugstore is slacking on
really really pretty nice blushes I saw
this one by Neutrogena this one is in
rosy this is their healthy skin blush
and it has like this era de sand glow
over it
super pigmented and it has a beautiful
glow to it and it's a really pretty
blush so the packaging is super simple
and it looks like nothing but one that's
watch that man is watching the store or
any of you guys have swatch stuff in the
drugstore like Eli click around and open
it and you're saying nope I feel like
we've all done that once really it is a
very pretty brush it's everything I
thought it would be so I'm really
excited about this blush actually that
is it for my drugstore haul I hope you
