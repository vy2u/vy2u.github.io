all right I'm getting crazy hey guys
welcome to my channel today's video is
going to be a drugstore favorites video
I haven't done one of these in a hot
minute and I I want to do them way more
often because the drugstore is
constantly coming out with new products
that I truly love and just punch do a
dedicated video on affordable makeup I
might not do a monthly favorites this
month and might like let this be my my
monthly favorites video let me know in
your comments what you think about Lera
this is like a favorites and then I did
like my favorite Holy Grail products
this month so there's been like a lot of
favorites going on maybe in return
instead of do my favorites month I'll do
something like products that didn't work
for me this month I don't know just
throwing some ideas out yeah a lot of
new products out that I do herb and I
want to talk to you about them um do you
guys like my hat I think it's so cute I
wear it like every day of the week cuz
it gives me a full excuse not to have to
do my hair gonna jump right in the video
be sure to subscribe to my channel or
you leave because you'll miss me if you
don't I don't know just subscribe let's
jump and get started I feel like I never
start with lip products just because
that's what I do laughs whenever I do my
makeup so in this video I'm going to
start first with lip products the very
first one is by Maybelline this has
actually been out for a minute I just
discovered my true love for it this one
is their vivid matte it's like a whipped
liquid lipstick not like a full-on kiss
proof liquid lipstick this one is in
number 5 nude thrill 3 and honestly the
color of it is absolutely right up my
alley and lip color is kind of like one
of my go-to lip colors I like that it's
not too drying however in my opinion I
don't think these are all that matte
finish I think they have somewhat of a
glossy finish to them can you see that
shine they pretty much stay like that on
my lips instead of like a full matte
finish like I have on today so if you're
looking for a matte finish even though
they say vivid matte liquid
it ain't matte but it is really pretty
and I do enjoy wearing them so this
one's awesome next for a lippy the NYX
matte lipstick this one is in sable and
is a very topi nude color and I love it
so much I don't know what my issue has
been lately but like I have been
avoiding colorful lipsticks that's about
to change I promise but lately like I've
worn nude for a straight month I can't
help myself
this is a mate that chipped nail an
appointment with Kristen and Patrick to
go get our nails done tomorrow but for
today it's going to be chipped and
you're going to pretend that it's not
okay okay
anyways I've had an addiction to news
and that the drugstore honestly I have a
hard time putting in news that I like it
isn't to sin ami means when I like a lot
I like the texture of it as well and
this one is even more matte than the
matte liquid by Maybelline can see that
you can totally tell us more matte this
is just a little guy I was playing with
earlier but I do love this and if you do
get a chance you love newts you will
adore this okay I have to mention this
because you guys know you it's like I
already knew I was gonna mention
whenever I started the video this is the
butter bronzer from Physicians Formula
there's just I don't use the brush and
just fill out and I ain't picking it up
here it is I love this bronzer I think
it's like one of the greatest bronzer
sold at the drugstore and he is so
awesome it just it just gives off that
perfect color which sometimes at the
drugstore they're either chalky or else
they have a lot of shimmer and glitter
in them which I don't want my bronzer
and this is just like everything I look
for a bronzer the only thing I don't
like is the smell and that's a
preference thing that's not like
everybody's gonna hate it because of the
smell some people like their makeup the
smell but like right now is like killing
me I like no sense in my makeup honestly
like that's what I prefer now the sweet
peach palette to face that was the only
one that I was like okay I do like this
moving right along Maybelline came out
with the master strobing sticks these
are awesome I like both of them I like
both of them the same because they're
two completely different colors and
they're both really awesome first one is
number 100 light it's a pinky nude it's
gonna be amazing for a lighter skin tone
and just because I say it'd be amazing
for a lighter skin tone does not mean a
deeper skin tone couldn't pull it off
I'm just saying I think would be
beautiful and compliment nice
lighter skin tone this is it right here
I was like a pinky undertone so good so
it is a creamy formula but once you
blend them out with your finger it turns
it to kinda like a powder the next one
is a little bit more golden locust
number 200 medium I think these will
look beautiful on a deep skin tone it
has it almost like a golden hue
undertone to it I like both of them I
think they're amazing come through
highlighter come through drugstore
Maybelline these are great little sticks
um can you see that highlight honestly
the highlight on them is not anything
crazy it's not like you're gonna be able
to see from outer space which I know we
all typically look for something like
that but these are nice or even a nice
base for your highlight see how they're
kind of light they're not such a heavy
highlight the next product I want to
talk about is by L'Oreal this is some
magic lumi this is a primer it's been
out for a long time and I've used it for
a long time it is a nice primer that
will give you a little bit of a luminous
finish under your foundation I do not
use this in the summer time because the
sunshine and heat gives you girl Laura
enough of a luminous finish naturally
the winter time or my skin is dry or I
know I'm not gonna be out in the heat I
will apply this to my skin it's just so
pretty as an awesome drugstore buy
however if you have only skin I don't
think this is gonna be your friend
because it's just gonna add to the whole
ok the next product is a newer one that
I'm just like getting into loving this
is the pixi by petra makeup fixing miss
someone told me that this was a dupe for
the mac fix+ spray I don't think it's
due but I do think it's awesome I think
it's a very setting spray it has
rosewater and green tea in it so it's
good for your skin and it does set the
makeup really nicely so this is an
awesome setting spray from the drugstore
I don't pack on my eyeshadows or like
Tamm to my eyeshadows or anything like
that with it I merely use it just to set
my makeup and I think it's awesome
blossom the next product to mention to
you guys I feel like I found I bought
this little while back but I love it I
hope it's still for sale this one's by
Rimmel London this is the Kate 0:03 gold
Braun's set I do not wear the bronzer in
it because this is the deeper one that
might be a little dark not my shade of
bronzer however the blush in highlight
is so beautiful the blush reminds me of
NARS my are orgasm orgasm by NARS and
then the highlight is so pretty so I'm
going to show you the highlight pact on
top of the maybelline highlight now you
see the highlight hi hello it's very
pretty I do feel like the Rimmel
products are a little bit powdery like
dry the powder in them but for the price
I think the pigmentation and that
product colors are beautiful so it's
good it's a it's a winner for me next I
want to talk about the NYX or the next
liquid liner you want to it's funny
whenever first time my channel whenever
you first start YouTube channel a little
insecure
it's scary putting yourself out there at
first I remember something my next and
one go I will never forget when me the
biggest paragraph on how stupid I was
because I pronounced it as Nick's not
NYX and it she was like it's in my ex
not NYX you need to stop saying NYX and
now I'm like three years later like so
that just goes to show you like I fully
believed that person thought I was the
biggest city in the world and was
embarrassed by the video but that
literally just goes to show you you have
to believe in yourself because this next
girl anyways I used to and I still do
use the NYC the NYC and YX is getting
crazy the NYC liquid liner um it is
awesome but lately a transition into the
next one and honestly they're pretty
much the same I just ran out my NYC when
I jumped over this one I think is
amazing next product to mention to you
guys is a makeup brush from the
drugstore and I'm picky about my makeup
brushes like they ever get the job done
no games playing so one thing I found
for the drugstore I like these are
awesome new brushes to Walmart this is
royal and langnickel is the brand their
brushes are like blue they're pink or
purple like they're colored and they
kind of like this and they're nice
quality brushes for the price
paper one is the contour brush which is
this one I'm showing you right here it's
just so soft and it's so it doesn't feel
cheap it feels nice it does remind me a
little bit of real techniques but I
think they cost a little less than real
technique so I would definitely check
out their makeup brushes especially this
little contour one I love this one for
contouring the next product I want to
mention to you guy guys is a new powder
from Maybelline so I don't use this oh
by the way it has salicylic acid in it
so it's great for acne this is a
foundation powder and what I like to use
this little guy for clearly I don't use
a sponge in it but I like to use this to
set my concealer this is not the shade
that I use this is warm nude just closer
to my skin tone but I used the lightest
one which is way over there and my
makeup drawers lost in the ocean of
makeup I like to use this one to touch
up my makeup you know and I like to use
the lighter shade to set my concealer
like you would see me used to on
associate banana powder to set under my
eyes while I like to use the lighter
shade of the better skin by Maybelline
to do that with and this is their first
powder ever with self so like acid in it
I just read that off the back I didn't
like I don't know go to some seminar
Maybelline how literal is read off the
back of the package um it sounds like at
acid is a treatment for acne so if
you're dealing with that way makeup and
fighting acne at the same time kind of
way be mad at that I have to mention
this product because this is
tried-and-true this is the age rewind
concealer mine has been shown to too
much love it's been bean and battered
and it's because this is like the most
full coverage concealer you can buy from
the drugstore in my opinion it's amazing
however if I like do the full triangle
and fill it in to my under-eye to
highlight and blend that out is too much
makeup like it's too cakey I'll wear it
for two hours and it will just start
like separating and just being like this
is one of those you just kind of and
then blend it out you don't want to use
too much of this stuff it will be a
hot-ass mess you use the right amount
it's just
absolutely beautiful perfect and amazing
coverage it looks like a high-end
concealer
okay I know it talked so much about
Maybelline in this video and it's
because like I said they came out with
so many new products and I wanted to
talk to you guys not only about stuff
that I've been loving for a long time
but also some new stuff so it's like a
lot of Maybelline also I've been loving
the brow precise by Maybelline they
remind me so much as the next bright
micro brow pencil here it is um the
actual product reminds me so much one
another I think they're awesome
I am in shade so this one actually
doesn't say the shade on it anywhere
it's just the dark brown one um these
are pretty much the same product I don't
know which one is cheaper but I'm happy
Maybelline's actually coming out with
some awesome brow products on the
drugstore market because hey you know my
little friends here they need all the
help they can get I will be honest with
you I'd use my benefit brow pencil on
the daily but I have been testing this
one out and I think it's a great
affordable option okay that is my
rundown on my favorite drugstore
products lately and just what I've been
loving I don't have a foundation today
that I've just been absolutely obsessed
with I did get the new Loreal Pro
Foundation in the blue squeezy bottle
and I will be testing that out and I
will let you know what I think about it
