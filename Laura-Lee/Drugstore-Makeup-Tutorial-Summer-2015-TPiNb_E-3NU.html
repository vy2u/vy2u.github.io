praying to God right now I don't have
lipstick on my teeth ah dang it
today's makeup tutorial it's gonna be
all drugstore yeah buddy you guys seem
to like whenever I create drugstore only
tutorials on my channel and it's been
just a little bit since I've done one so
I was like it's so about that time I
decided to create this look I did a
couple I with a nude lip I really like
the way it turned out this is like a
slight pop of color but not too much you
know not going crazy definitely wearable
and just FYI letting you guys know I did
get a peel box it's been down in the
description box for about a week now
maybe so send me some cool write me
letter tell me your thoughts so hate no
please I don't know you can send me hate
mail if you want I'll probably laugh at
it anyways we're gonna jump right in and
we're gonna get learnin Stein because I
have my foundation and primer and a
bazillion videos I went ahead and did my
foundation with my paper it fit me boy
listen matte foundation and then we'll
first I added the primer which was the
next angel el primer and I know I look
so weird right now and that's because I
already have my eyebrows filled in so
we're just gonna get a teeny tiny bit of
dance the tides by night on the tip of
my brush and I'm gonna blend that I'm
gonna blend that upward in the crease
very small circular motions this color
is so pigmented it's almost too
pigmented like I have to blend all this
out so you definitely don't wanna leave
anything funny-looking like that and
that was just like the tiniest
to color I'm going to blend that all the
way from outer to inner corner
it's gonna get a clean blending brush
this is an m4 4-1 by morphe and I'm just
gonna blend out that now I've got this
eyeshadow from prestige cosmetics which
you can get at Ulta in the drugstore
section this is called true metals
eyeshadow and I'm using those three
copper and they're really pretty but
actually I'm am swatch Tom but this is
the first time I've worn one so I'm just
kinda trying it out it's really pretty
though swatch pretty here's some
swatches alone I couldn't decide what
color I wanted to use so I just sitting
there playing with them but this copper
color like I couldn't stop staring at it
copper it is these in this synthetic
brush when packing on color not a
blending brush that way we get the most
out of our color payoff
the next part is gonna get a little
weird I'm gonna go ahead and apologize
for that but I'm gonna be taking a new
tude and double dare these turn next
blushes and I'm gonna basically pick up
mostly the matte brown color and I'm
just gonna get a teeny teeny tiny touch
of the reddish color because I want a
warm tone Brown but I couldn't find
exactly what I was looking for so I'm
just gonna kind of make the color
trying to find something like cocoa beer
by makeup geek in the struggle - real as
far as from the drugstore just taking
the e25 brush I'm just gonna like with
the light is impossible blend this on
the outer corner and I'm gonna make the
copper color blend in with the actual
eyelid that would there's no harsh line
right there doing really light swiping
motions back and forth I'm going to take
a little bit of a pretty in pink with
this elf brush this front first stage
and it's just a light shimmery color you
can use any light shimmery color you
have and I'm just gonna pop this right
onto the brow bone I'm going to add some
mascara I'm using the super sizer my
covergirl their new mascara
I tried this mascara out one time and it
wasn't in love with it but I'm willing
to give it a few more tries because I
feel like once just isn't enough to
really know
I'm gonna go in with some ardell demi
whispies ashes these are my favorite
lashes from the drugstore oh look they
even gave me a little bit of glue but
I'm actually gonna use the duo black
glue these totally have like a glue
booger you know look at that pop these
on because these lashes are so light and
wispy and natural-looking I'm actually
gonna pop another pair right on top and
just double stack them skip this step
completely if you're not comfortable
with it I know I'm a crazy drama freak
when it comes with lashes but like you
don't have to be don't feel like you
have to do this where the makeup looks
not complete just add your mascara and
roll with it honey I'm gonna be going it
with one my favorite drugstore
concealers this is the instant age
rewind I actually did a whole video on
my favorite drugstore concealers so
there soon denying that this is a
favorite but I'm just gonna pop this on
under the eye a little nose maybe a
little in for it in the chin I'm just
gonna go back in with a kabuki you can
totes use your fingers to blend out your
concealer it actually gives it a really
nice airbrushed finish whenever you do
that as well
plug in with this Maybelline fit me
powder I'm gonna go in with this little
blush brush from ELF the shape of it is
just couldn't be more perfect to fit
right in the under eye area and to set
the concealer
I'm gonna go in with this bronzer by
Physicians Formula it's got argan all in
it I really like the color of the
bronzer but I don't like the fact that I
can smell it on my face all day you can
smell the argan all but I'm gonna go in
with this brush from ELF this is their
blending brush like that's all it says
on it it's just blending brush I'm gonna
be smelling argan oil all day long it's
the price we pay for that bronze look
we're just gonna take a little bit of
that bronzer and run it down the nose
I'm going to add a little bit of Milan
ease berry a more blush it reminds me a
lot of warm soul by Mac a lot of trouble
telling you guys that
they go in with a little bit of my ELF
this is one my favorite drugs were
highlighters this is the violet petal
this is just like their highlight stick
it's a really beautiful highlighter you
can definitely leave the highlighter off
if you're not into the globe though like
it's it's not your thing don't do it
now I'm gonna finish the under eye area
I'm gonna go back in with a little bit
of dance a tides in this little bitty
brush I'm just gonna dust it from the
outer corner kind of connect it with the
eyeshadow and bring it around to the
inner corner so the pencil brush coming
back into copper I'm gonna dust some on
the inner corner and then I'm gonna
bring it around to the lower lash line a
little bit
I just had to reapply these lashes
because they were stabbing me so hard in
the inner corner I was either gonna cry
or kill someone it was hurting so bad
it's gonna go in with a little bit of
this NYX black liner and I'm gonna get
that waterline it good
we can go for a nude lip I'm going to
wet and wild bear at all
I'm just going to apply some of this
covergirl clear gloss on top
