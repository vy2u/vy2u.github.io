today's video is going to be talking
about drugstore products that I think
that you need in your life get out of
here I love talking about drugstore
products on my channel and I love always
just trying to involve that more on my
channel I think that we do see it a lot
but not enough in the beauty community
because I know high-end products can
kind of take over the beauty world very
easy because there's so many nice luxury
high-end products that do so many great
things for us but we can't forget about
the drugstore okay people the drugstore
too has so much to offer us and
sometimes I think it's forgotten about
so dedicating this video to my top
drugstore products because I did one of
these about 6 or 7 months ago a while
back and there are so many great new
products that come out that I need to
talk about with you guys that are all
for the drugstore so we don't do that
today hoping this video won't get too
long but we all know I'm a little bit of
a talker but we will move someone
quickly but ever see this video so if
you're interested in seeing my top
drugstore products and what I think you
need in your life in the drugstore well
then just keep watching
I don't think I have liked necessarily
each category I just grabbed the stuff
that I loved so much from the drugstore
and I figured we'll talk about it so
first add two brushes I want to talk
about they're both by elf cosmetics and
they are both of similar shapes which is
just a coincidence but the worst one is
the blending brush this one was actually
they roast it to be my ELF but I've seen
them on their website if I can find
another website you know a link right
down below in the description box always
tons of information in the description
box so be sure to check that out but um
this one is awesome for contouring it's
like such a dupe I don't know even know
what exact brush is a dupe for because I
don't know what brush it that's high in
exactly like this but it's gonna be a
dupe for something I'm telling you guys
it's a good good good brush for
contouring you know Bronson up the face
a little bit I used it in my five-minute
drugstore makeup tutorial so yeah that's
where it was used in action and then we
have the little fan brush this brush is
so amazing for highlighting your face
and there are a lot of these brushes out
on the market for really high prices but
this one I believe is three dollars if
I'm not mistaken
I'm usually mistaken next product I'll
talk to you guys about is the fabulous
and no fast in this is hard caning
setting spray is a good setting spray it
cost around six dollars but it's like a
jet stream that soaks your face when it
comes out so don't say I didn't warn you
that it's powerful and it smells kind of
bad but it does a good job in setting
your makeup so if you have a problem
with your makeup sloughing off or you
just know you're gonna have to wear for
a long time without a touch-up well then
try this out fast and fabulous I try to
pick one concealer talked to you guys
about but it just was not happening for
me so I ended up with two to talk to you
guys about
they're both by Maybelline so Maybelline
you know what you're doing in the
concealer category are you guys a part
about it it's been around the block in
the YouTube community for quite a while
this is the instant age rewind concealer
and it does an amazing job covering up
the dark mess and this one is in light
pail which is almost a wee bit too light
for me but I've almost used half the
tube of it and I normally use like a
different concealer in a different
foundation it was
day because I like to switch it up I'm a
beauty blogger like my options but I
keep going back to this one just a good
concealer for dark circles and I think
it look works well for the dry under-eye
situation okay the next one is a newer
one
from Maybelline it is the better skin
concealer have this one in shade
light/medium and let me tell you what I
like about this one I like to highlight
the whole face with this one and it is
because it is an old free concealer I
know I said the word all wrong but let
me just say how I want to say it people
okay he's not prefer to highlight my
face with this drugstore concealer it's
because it's an oil free oil co set it
Reich whenever you're highlighting your
face you're putting a little on the
forehead down the nose the chin the
under I mean you're putting it all over
your face and if you have oily skin well
then that can create a disaster but with
this being all free it is a little bit
more dry textured but it's not gonna
leave your face looking crazy crazy
throughout the day so you here are my
friend why is there a MAC lipstick in
this drugstore mix I don't even know
what's happening in my life right now
expert talk about is mascara ruscus I
recently discovered that I had eyelashes
always wear false lashes because it's
just easier and quicker for me to pop on
some false lashes and roll out with my
day where I did my back to school
five-minute makeup tutorial I realized
that I had eyelashes and maybe I should
use them sometimes to drugstores
concealer mascaras that I like to use
are the first one is a Milani runway
lashes this is been a tried-and-true in
a long time really good mascara for me
because it adds a I'm gonna brainfart
that's a lot of volume to the lashes and
it does kind of clunk them together but
I just love how full it makes them
either way and this one is like super
affordable and the next one I like is
the Maybelline lash sensational mascara
and I like this because it lateness them
them and it spreads them apart and
because the wands like that hard plastic
wand it does good and light getting the
clumps out that the runway lashes leave
behind so I prefer these together in
unison
let's actually talk about some false
lashes as I just stated my case on quit
wearing false lashes so let's talk about
false lashes does this video make any
sense to you guys huh Vegas night came
out with drugstore lashes they are some
of the best drugstore lashes ever hope
they're by aisle or which is the brand
that collab with her my favorites that
she came out with our shining star and I
used them in a tutorial but I don't
remember which one I really like these
lashes they are super girly a little bit
dramatic the very curled up and they're
very pretty and they're very affordable
and if you tag her on instagram using
these lashes you might get a shout out
she has like 5 million followers ok what
Trish knows next let's talk about a
bronzer this bronzer is amazing for
giving your skin that warm glow not for
contouring your face not for contouring
your face CEO for globe baked bronzer by
Milani this will be a nightmare if you
contoured your face with it because it
has so much shimmer and just glow in it
it wouldn't like build structure to your
face it was just warming up the skin
giving you that nice sunkissed look yeah
good take it down a little bit okay
I'm going to take it down like two of
five I was at a 10 I'm gonna take it to
a fast bronzer itself it's a little bit
of a lighter bronzer but I like that
about it because it's not too dark for
the skin and it does have a little bit
of gold flakes within it like throughout
it so it just gives you like that golden
hue and you just look like a Victoria's
Secret model on the beach hey I should
have talked about foundations first but
I did it and you guys probably already
know what my favorite drugstore
foundations are they are the Maybelline
fit me the matte and poreless one is my
actual favorite and I don't even have
oily skin really um but it's still my
favorite because it just sets really
well on my skin and I like the finish
because it's not too matte it's not like
blank slate face it's like it lets your
skin show through a little bit
it's these aren't the most long wearing
foundations in the world I'll give you
that you might have to set them with a
powder to get them to last a little bit
longer or you can use your fast and
fabulous
setting spray but I still like them
they're actually in a really affordable
foundation from the drugstore because
drugstores trying to get a little bit
cry cry and raise their prices on
foundations okay I'm sorry but like 25
to 30 dollars at the drugstore is too
much for a drugstore foundation like get
out of here leave goodbye go I'm like
sitting here like what am I like the
price determiner for all drugstore
products I entitle myself
I just think drugstore foundation should
run anywhere from 5 to like $15 tops and
people I mean brands are just getting
crazy and they need to UM take a chill
pill on that there's some one of the
more affordable ones and then the second
one is the dewy and smooth but this one
has a little bit of sunscreen in it but
if I know if I'm going to be outside for
a long time or if you have really dry
skin you might like this one way better
than the matte and poreless feel oily
skin I would stay away from this one the
sunscreen in it and just the doing this
just isn't going to be your best friend
so don't say I didn't warn ya a quick
fYI I am in shade 220 in each of those
like the same Shea you get me you I'm
saying no I want to talk about a lip
liner which I just discovered in my
makeup collection do you guys ever do
that you like quit wearing something
because you get tired of it you
rediscovering it and it's just the
greatest thing that ever happened to you
that is what has happened to me with
this lip liner it is by NYX and the
shade is nude pink 858 you can probably
find this at Ulta that a little Nick's
section is a really great universal
nudey pink color and they collide on so
good like I would almost say that these
are just as good as a Mac lip liner as
far as the texture and formula of them
they just like yes something I have just
been really proud of the drugstore for
doing it's coming out with an awesome
eyebrow pencil Thank You NYX thank you
okay eyebrow pencil it's not quite as
creamy and slick as the honest house or
Beverly Hills brow Wiz but it's getting
there like it's about as close as you
can get for a dupe and this is the NYX
micro brow pencil and this one is in
shade expresso if anyone asks me advice
for brows from the drugstore I
automatically recommend the NYX brow
pencil it's awesome I'll really briefly
mention the NYC liquid liner by NYC
eat this lip liner is what I use nine
times out of ten for my makeup looks or
I use like my morphe black gel liner I'm
doing gel but as far as liquid liner
it's pretty much always gonna be the NYC
liquid liner it's super black it dries
matte the brush is awesome to create
that flick for the wink I can't say
enough good things about it and it's two
dollars okay we're getting to the bottom
of the barrel I'll talk about a blush
from the drugstore that I have been
liking and I just can't find very many
blushes from the drugstores that I
obsess over but I really been liking
this one I've used it in like two or
three tutorials this is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin blush this is number 10
rosy and I love the shade and it has
like this shimmery iridescent peach over
it and it's so pretty on the skin it
looks super high-end it really does and
their healthy skin line laughs like I
like the formula of the healthy skin
line so that's all I'll say about that
but I really like that blush right there
and then let me talk about a facial
primer I feel like I'm going backwards
but that's okay that's okay for those of
you who are still here this is a master
prime by Maybelline I find that a lot of
the drugstore facial primers can be a
little bit too silicone based like just
too much and they can leave you at the
end of the day feeling a little bit
greasy a little bit too late'
chick-chick slick hmm what am I trying
to use there they're just too much but
this one's a really subtle nice
smoothing facial primer and normally
bits of smoothing facial primer it's
going to be super silicone base but this
one actually isn't and it works really
well
so master prime maybelline smooth and
blur don't forget it last prompt now I
have two more products and then I'll be
quiet
next is the fit me powder that actually
kind of goes with like the foundations
it came out at the same time in matte
and poreless so because I said that
these don't last that long and I
honestly I never recommend upon your
foundation powder on top of your
foundation because it's just too much
you normally want to use a mineral
powder or translucent powder on top of
your foundations but this one time and
one time only I'm going to recommend
that you use this fit me matte and
poreless foundation powder top of that
because they work really well and you
then and another thing that I like this
for is whenever I don't want that like
super bright under-eye with the
highlighted I just want a normal face
kind of day I normally set my concealer
with this you kind of deepen that
lightness in the under eye and just make
your face kind of more so one color than
like highlighting contoured and
structured let me get the last product
because it's disappeared it took me like
30 minutes to find it I swear if you
sell my beauty room right now you'd be
like we're calling TLC quarters best
product is the highlighter by L'Oreal
this is the True Match Lumi this one is
in Rose in 201 like this one the best
out of all three of them I love the rose
gold look to it I don't really have a
highlighter that has that exact rose
gold look to it and I just really like
the way these set on the skin they dry
nice they almost like drying to a powder
so they don't feel heavy on your skin
but I will tell you that they came out
with three of the compact powder
highlighters by L'Oreal and I don't like
them they're a little bit too dry
they're a little bit dusty and they have
like glitter in homes no girl now
anyways I wanted to recommend this one
to you if you're looking for a
highlighter from the drugstore that is
it for this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up if
you did enjoy and don't forget to
