channel today's video is going to be my
drugstore bus pass and I know I did this
video let's say about a month ago maybe
two months ago I don't know I did it
semi recently and that was more so in
the winter but let me tell you something
on there drugstores have come out with
some hot products for the spring 2015
I'm just crazy about them and I just
want to say don't feel like just because
you I mean I use high-end products I did
your drugstore tutorials but I do use a
lot of high-end products and my other
tutorials and I just don't ever want you
guys to feel like excuse me that you
have to have this exact products to
recreate a look I just use my iron
products cuz they're there but you guys
know I am loyal to doing drugstore
makeup tutorials for you guys because I
think drugstore products have really
stepped their game up and I think
they're just as good if you're dressed
in seeing the drugstore must-have that I
think you need in yo life will then
please just keep watching honey child
alright alright we do not just have
makeup products in this basket here we
add up conscious toshow we're just gonna
jump around in and first I'll grab these
two little Argan oils by physician's
formula and what I think is so cool
about these is that a drugstore finally
came out with argan oil because they
wanted an arm a leg in your firstborn
child for any high-end argan all that
sound righteous I don't know why that
they are and then boom here we go
positions formulas like hold up real
quick like here with two you have a
luminizing one and just a regular one
you guys because summer and spring time
is coming up I know it's still snowy for
some of you guys who hear in Caly it is
quite sunny it's like 80 degrees and hot
going to the beach I like to coat my
skin in this not only is it moisturizing
but the luminizing one definitely gives
your skin that nice glow the original
one it's just very moisturizing to the
skin
it does drying the skin quite quickly
quite quickly definitely a must-have for
this summer
the next product I'll talk about is this
NYX it will have two facial primers so
we'll talk about this one the NYX HD
studio photogenic primer base that was
like way too much for this little primer
the NYX HD primer we'll call it that
this is a great primer I'm very
impressed with it
this one doesn't feel silicon-based at
all it is so lightweight it just almost
turns into air on your skin so if you
have all these skin and you feel like
putting a primer on your skin it's just
too much makeup it's too heavy and you
get greasy try out this NYX HD primer
super lightweight and does a great job
in helping out with the longevity of
your makeup and just locking your
foundation into place I don't notice
that it helps out with helping out with
you know hiding and blurring out pores
which the next primer does it smell like
anything
the next primer I'll talk to you about
does the next one that I just am all
about is this master prime this is a bio
middle in New York
I like this smooth and blur the best but
if you they make one for like darkness
and redness they did a good job on these
um but the blur and smooth is my fave it
is a really good picture primary just
feel a little bit more like a silicon
based primer so like I said you're just
not up for that try out that next guy
back there but if you are definitely try
the master prime or if you have large
pores and things that you want to smooth
out on your face this is your friend
rocky the next product I want to talk
about is something that I am all about
this is my holy Garrett this is my holy
grail foundation that in a drugstore
this is the little it's on backwards but
this is to fit me matte poreless
foundation by Maybelline oh this is such
a great great foundation the formula of
it is perfect though it's not too greasy
not too lightweight provides that
perfect medium coverage very
long-lasting is everything you can ask
for and it's a drugstore foundation
I don't always reach for just because I
have a lot of foundations on
Colet them so i like to use my different
foundations like i use a different
foundation every day but I will say if I
use a drugstore foundation it's gonna be
this guy because this foundation is so
amazing and I heard dry skin
I don't even deal with oily skin which
you would think that type of person
would buy the matte and poreless but
it's great on my skin it doesn't cling
to my dry patches it doesn't make my
dryness worse this is just a Holy Grail
foundation and if you ain't got it you
need to go get it up says next I want to
talk about this NYX color correcting
powder this is an awesome setting powder
and I've been looking for a good drug
source this sweatshirts just way too hot
today about to frickin die in these
lights
oh and I've been looking for a good
setting powder that is not translucent
but drugstore and that has been really
hard to find but I have totally found it
and I love it and I've been using it
non-stop and this is new from Nick so
they come in a couple of different
colors but the one that is my favorite
because I'm a little bit yellowy
undertone is the banana color that's
what this one's called yeah they're not
out already they'll be it Ulta soon and
I know they're already on the next
website but these are so great for
setting that under-eye concealer
my friend you're under house will be set
for days just because it's yellow it's
not like been nice banana powder but I
will tell you that the Anastacio
compressed banana powder and this are
very compatible
so don't go out and spend all your
pennies on that try out this NYX color
correcting powder it's really good
the next product I want to talk about
this highlighter and had this for a very
long time so it's kind of crushed it
it's a really good liquid highlighter
and it's by next as well this is Oh to
blame and I picked this up at Ulta like
ages ago and I still have it because I
still love it I love you a good liquid
Luminizer and it's very lightweight on
the skin so again you're not left
feeling like a Gracie ball it's like
it's going Chris T on it and so the o2
gleam is like my favorite because it has
a
rose-gold sheen on it and not a lot of
highlights have that Sheen most of them
have like that champagne yellow
undertone where's this one has a pinky
undertone and it's very hard to find
something like this but this is just a
unique little Jim that's in my highlight
drawer and I love it in its super light
weight and it doesn't put too much of a
highlight just enough to have that
little bit of a JLo glow but not the
full JLo glow the next product
don't you guys love when I sing is the
back-to-basics that's the name of it but
this is the elf smudge pot and I
featured these in my haul like my uh my
ilk haul and I didn't like a lot of them
because the color on the outside or that
they represent on line doesn't transfer
off to that color they come off a little
bit darker but this one came off
perfectly and I am a gold eyeshadow
color like gold eyeshadow fanatic I love
gold eyeshadow just think it's so
flattering and this is back to the
basics so this smudge pot makes for the
perfect gold eyeshadow base if you were
doing like gold look you could even go
in super light hand it with this stuff
and create a little bit of a gold
highlight on your cheekbone that's
that's up to you but you could totally
do that with this it's a good smudge pot
and it definitely helps that gold
eyeshadow to be more enhanced and it
helps it to last longer and it was super
cheap because it was elf so very
affordable awesome product by elf is the
back-to-basics smudge pot this is a red
long time to consider said I want to
talk to you guys about and they're both
by Maybelline haigo haye the first one
is the age rewind would you guys
recommend it this to me whenever I don't
remember when I was a long time ago but
you guys recommended this concealer to
me and I went and got it and guess what
it's amazing not just for its brightness
power which it does have a good
brightness power but because it is so
like heavy duty coverage and this little
sponge on top is just weirds me out and
I know you can rip it off but I don't
know if I like being weirded out by it
but I
done anything I use it like I use it a
lot I don't know sponge is just weird I
feel like it's contaminated and at
board's charms but I just keep using it
is a great heavy coverage concealer um
and I painted it as a really great job
and covering up these dirty dirty bags
under my eyes and my next one that I
love so much and you know it was weird I
saw this in the packaging like in Target
or wherever I got it and I was like this
I'm going to love that give it to me so
this is the master conceal this is
Maybelline's newer concealer and I have
the shade light both of these are in the
shade light and this one is the softest
creamy moisturizing concealer I've ever
used in life if you have dry under eye
areas I definitely recommend the master
conceal to you and you can see from back
here that coverage is just cry cry so
Maybelline has got it goin on with the
coverage ups we'll talk about products
that aren't makeup they're those
products the first one is by Garnier
Fructis this is the texture tease and I
love my hair to have texture that's the
only way I can really get it to curl or
do anything other than wear it straight
I have frizzy hair but it just doesn't
have a lot of texture to it
so I've been using this everyday this
bottle is almost empty and it's just the
texture tease you can uh like spray it
in your hair before you curl it which is
normally what I do in the next sprain in
my hair after you can spray your roots
you know whatever you want to with this
stuff it's basically amazing and I had
tons of texture to your hair and it also
helps tease your hair
um but yeah and it's not a stronghold
it's definitely something that's very
flexible but it feels like you pair
sprayed your hair and then brush out the
hairspray that's kind of the texture
that it puts in your hair and I really
like that because like I said I don't
care for straight hair on me so I'm
always trying to do something with it
other than weird straight and this has
just been a Holy Grail for me next isn't
I'm it like there is a Christmas piece
of my Christmas tree stuck in there why
are you in here
is it Maybelline Kleenex press makeup
eye remover and I got the gel con and
the joke I used to be my favorite but it
is no longer my favorite okar
this is this is the liquid one I
literally have like one more use out of
it this is a great eye makeup remover if
I mess up on my gel liner trying to
weighing it out this is my go to it just
dip a little cotton swab in this and um
fix that bad boy right on up but it also
removes waterproof makeup it's just an
amazing job of removing makeup and I'm
very happy with it so I give them a
little shoutout lastly as it is for last
because I don't know they sell this
anymore so my deepest apologies if they
don't if I'm gonna ramble on about this
and it's something for so bad beauty
blogging but this is the Olay fresh
effects whoa the country came out of me
the Olay fresh effects do over this is a
gel hydrant this is my favorite Jill
hydrant from the drugstore um oh I can't
even tell you how good it smell it looks
like as the booger go around it because
it's pinned right up such a good
moisturizer very lightweight is
water-based if you have oily skin don't
worry about it clogging your pores and I
got this at Walgreens last year for like
four twelve or fourteen dollars I can't
remember but it is awesome you
definitely need it you know like I'm
just gonna go ahead and say I'm obsessed
with the whole Olay fresh effects hope
like the entire line is amazing and I
love it all but this moisturizer is like
uh-huh yep that was all of my drugstore
must-have products they've completely
changed and I try not to do any rate
Peaks because I know I just did my
current favorites and talked about some
products that I have been lovin for
