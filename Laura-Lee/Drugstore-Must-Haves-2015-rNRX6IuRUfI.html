is trying to play me so hard today so I
had a whipping up into this little one
right now because I don't know it just
ain't answerin right and ain't putting
up with it today today's video is going
to be my drugstore favorites I try to
talk to you guys about drugstore
products more on my channel and
incorporate that a lot because a lot of
people don't want to spend 30 to 50
dollars on a blush highlight bronzer etc
they want that one thing affordable and
not only that jokes for makeup is super
easy access so sometimes assign me the
price people don't feel like finding
this before then near them or you know
what I mean like drugstore makeup is
like in every drugstore which is
everywhere do you where I'm going with
this
I recently did a drugstore dupes video
if you haven't checked it out I'll link
it right on down below also have a lot
of 2016 jokes to make up I'm going to
share with you that I've been loving
that hasn't really came out yeah but
it's coming out super super soon so I'm
letting you in the know know on that
hey what a sonic scissors is what does
that be the hair I'd have like a weird
haircut the first one I want to talk
about is from wet and wild Beauty this
is their new they came out with new
brushes and I'll just show you the three
of them that I absolutely adore so the
first one is called their powder brush
and it just looks like this it's a
pretty typical powder brushes I don't
have the prices on yeah I'll try to get
them and link them down below in the
description but I love how soft and
fluffy these brushes are but typically
use that one for your powder or your
bronzer and then we have like a
stippling brush from wet and long Beauty
and I would use this to stipple out my
concealer or even my foundation you know
whatever you want to do with it have a
good time with it and lastly I really
like this eyeshadow brush from them this
is the wet log PD eyeshadow brush and
it's a nice fluffy fluffy brush I think
it would work really nice to blend out
the crease or even pack on color cuz
it's like that flat edge they're just
really pretty and they're really soft
and I love them thank you and another
brush I just like discovered from Real
Techniques even though it's been around
for a hot minute is this what is this
cold setting bro which is what I like to
use it for I think this is one of the
best drugstore brushes to do that with
oh they're just so soft and fluffy and
they're all kind of like I don't know
like dome shape and stiffled all the
brushes are great from Real Techniques a
lot of people ask me you know that I
could recommend some drugstore brushes
to them
Real Techniques are sold at Ulta believe
they're sold at Target now Real
Techniques starcom max i thing i want to
mention to you guys is another
wet-and-wild product i don't know i
don't think this is a 2016 product i
think this is out this is 834 e berry
shimmer Blish so i've had a lot of
trouble finding like a really nice
drugstore blush I mean I've gone through
the Milani once I feel like we've all
been there with a baked Palani blushes
but I just wanted something new I found
that in the wet and wild berry shimmer
blush it's such a pretty color it
definitely is not a matte blush it has
like an iridescent over it but I love it
it's pretty pigmented and nice and
creamy
I have so many lip products to talk
about with you guys I'm gonna save
should save them all to the end well
I'll do two of them now whenever I was
at the next store in Rancho Cucamonga
Victoria Gardens I picked up two of the
soft matte lip creams which these are so
hard to find because everybody knows
they're good and so they are sold out
all the time of the next war was like
slam full of them so I got Copenhagen in
Transylvania these are two shades I've
seen people like on Pinterest the little
lips pictures it's like unrealistically
good seen these all over Pinterest and I
can never find these two colors no
matter what like cannot find these two
colors and I finally found them they are
so pretty so one is definitely just like
a berry maroon color great for winter or
fall and the other one is super super
vampy if I hadn't named this color on my
own I would name it black cherry that's
what it reminds me of it's super dark I
recommend getting out of your comfort
zone and wearing a bright or dark or
something different on your lips I know
it seems scary but it washes off next
product I want to mention to you guys is
the elf glitter glue primer I it's not
glue it's just Oh pal right in the
kitchen this is the elf glitter primer
for your eyelids and all those glittery
looks basically I've been playing a lot
with the new makeup geek pigments and
these and I find that they're just so
much more pigmented and have like a lot
less fun whenever you use a glitter
primer right on top of packing when
packing it onto the lid now I don't
recommend getting this anywhere near
your crease because it's just gonna make
like the crease coat of white chunky and
definitely not gradient but I blend out
all the shades in my crease I then like
pack it onto my lid and then I'll put
whatever pigment I'm using right on top
of this and it turns out Falah pen we
have a moment talk about this lip liner
I have a looking high and low for a good
nude lip liner that is not pink tone the
drugstores like is slacking with their
nudes like every time I find a new from
the drugstore is like super pink
undertone in it so it looks like you're
wearing baby pink lips and that's not
what I'm going for I like the brownie
nude like the skin color nude not like
Paracon this at the next war this is the
natural like literally the name of it is
just natural it's a retractable lip
liner the color of it is seriously to
die for it is exactly what I was looking
for it might be a dupe for stripped down
by Mac y'all this is it I have to
mention this eyeliner and
drugs for video that I do because I use
his eyeliner almost every day for the
past I don't know five years five or six
years this is my NYC liquid liner I'm
like literally and appropriately
scratching my head this is a NYC liquid
liner now they have one that's like a
shimmery black and then they have just
the regular black the regular black is
where it's at add to lipstick someone's
house you guys about the first one is
Eurotrash this is a matte lipstick from
NYX and I love this color I don't know
it's kind of hard to describe it kind of
reminds me of kind of sexy by Mac it's a
had to describe it I would say it's a
mauve pink with like a brown undertone
gorgeous and I love the finish because
you know I'm all about that matte lip so
of course this gives you that nice matte
flat finish okay beige love omikoshi oh
yeah we're gonna talk about this consi
layer I compared this in my door so dibs
video to the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
I love the NYC HD photogenic concealer
shade that I always go to is cwo for
beige it is such an awesome concealer
probably one of the best ones from the
drugstore I do like the Maybelline
better skin concealer a lot as a durable
concealer but this one should spin like
an oldie and a goodie to me and I've
just been loving it X I want to mention
to you guys a lip gloss which I
typically hate lip glosses but I think
this one is really interesting and I'm
pretty sure this is a new product from
one wild this is their lip gloss mega
slicks
the one that I like is shared wine and
dined
these are super pigmented glosses and
they're not too goopy so I love them I
like if you get a goopy gloss near me I
would literally be like hey look you get
from a coupie cloth some people love it
some people hate it I hate it another
product that I have been adoring for the
drugstore is the matte finish spray by
NYX this is a nice medified
a finishing spray donor one
remember what this was you live in a
humid area so it's just the east side
people say it's humid in California and
I'm like don't go there wait till you
have a summer in Alabama Florida area I
literally had like an afro a my hair
like straight as a board here it's not
humidity out with the matte finishing
spray I think would be right up your
alley if you just live in those humid
areas because my skin will be so dry but
still look wet because the air would be
so humid back home in Alabama but I
think this will be awesome for those
peeps next I want to talk about this
liner for your waterline I mentioned
this in my drugstore tubes I know I'm
such a repeater but I really love the
product so I want to talk about this is
the exaggerated liner this is the
waterproof liner for the waterline it's
a total do for the nut for the NARS is a
total dupe for the Tarte
inner rim liner and what it does is you
can pop it in to your water lines and it
just makes the eyes look naturally wider
and more open some people don't like
that some people like it I like it
sometimes just depends on the day and I
really like this formal one it's a super
affordable option next for a bronzer for
the drunks were my problem with bronzers
from the drugstore that I've been having
trouble finding is they all have shimmer
in them and I'm like now the one that I
found that has no shimmer in it that I
love so much is this one is my NYX it's
just their matte bronzer and I got the
shade medium which is almost a wee bit
too dark for me I almost could have went
with light I believe they have four
different shades in these and they're
quite lovely
that's I really lack it's the 16 hour
where kiss proof lip color by Rimmel
this is another nude that I have found
I'm like all about nudes guys this is
another new that I found that has no
pink undertone in it it's just a nice
cool tone brownie nude and it works out
real well for me so again this one is in
shade 700 skinny dipping do you love
these little guys right here these are
the ole a wet cleansing towels and I
like them because they are humongous
like the towels are really big compared
to normal makeup wipes and you get how
many you get in the package yeah you get
thirty of these in the package so
alcohol-free they don't burn my eyes
never take my makeup off and they do a
pretty good job of removing
make up I don't really I use them to get
like the bulk of makeup off not to
remove everything on my face I wash my
face to get all the makeup off but um
they just do an excellent job like they
do the work and also this is really
weird but have you ever got some like
makeup wipes and they just weren't wet
enough these are always super juicy next
I want to talk about this smooth skin
loose facial powder from NYC this is a
nice translucent powder to stay your
under out as a lot of that contour do
whatever you're doing with your
translucent powder this isn't really
nice one to use I think I saw this like
in a magazine like I didn't even know
that this existed and then saw on a
magazine or so I saw it somewhere and it
made me like go hunt it down and get it
and I really do enjoy it I will let you
know though if you use a camera it will
flash back at you someone asked me the
other day on a comment they asked what
flashback meant and I'll put a picture
right here of what flashback means yeah
girl that can happen to you mm-hmm
be careful last products talked about is
this wet and wild palette I've just been
tickled pink about it I think it's one
of the greatest drugstore eyeshadow
palettes my problem with eyeshadow
palettes from the drunk Schwar fine is
whenever you start blending out the
colors they turn into like a powdery
chalky does like and it looks like
there's nothing on your eyes I like
constantly run into that wood rocks or
products now wet and wild I believe this
palettes $5.99 or $6.99
either way it's super affordable and
this is number or the shade and this one
is comfort zone so you have a lot of
earthy tones in this palette like a
green some shimmery Browns a champagne
color a lot of nice colors to create a
lot of nice looks I really want to do is
to tour with this palette I just haven't
decided like what tutorial to do with it
this is the last thing I have to mention
um yeah we went over lots of good jokes
or stuff thank you guys so much for
being here thank you for watching I love
you guys is who Dib
oh you all have an absolutely amazing
day and I hope to see you all in my next
video
you gotta go and get angry at all of my
honesty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
