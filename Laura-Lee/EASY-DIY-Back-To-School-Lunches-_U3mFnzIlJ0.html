Brenda
and it's early and you're watching the
British early show I'm so long as the
vegan show so today's episode is gonna
be about back to school lunches I'm so
excited and I'm also smoked and angry
but uh this is my young niece Lauren
Lee's channel I'm Shirley I'm her aunt a
and I'm gonna be appearing on this
channel every now and my great friend
Brandon yes we are so excited today we
have back to school lunches if y'all
didn't know shameless plug added back to
school inches on my channel to what
Patrick's Patrick stars channel I love
it they're just gorgeous
today we'll jump into your lunches yes
yes and let us know in the comments if
you want us to appear more and you know
what if you don't like it get the hell
out okay we are gonna be doing back to
school lunches now these are great for
if you are in high school junior high he
dropped out of high school got your GED
went to college wish you would have went
to college or you're working horrible
nine to five you will enjoy these
lunches now what we're going to be doing
today is making lunch time skewers
skewer skewers cubers what our skewer
skewers are these little wooden sticks I
find that um can't become weapons in the
lunchroom children's yeah now what kind
of skewers are you cooking it today well
Miranda he would have given me a minute
I could have told you today we are gonna
be doing peanut butter and jelly skewers
ham and cheese skewers turkey and cheese
fewers you name it we'll put it on the
skewers eggplants mm-hmm
let's get started today we're gonna be
doing three skewers and for the first
one we're gonna be using a little bit of
bread bread string cheese screeching and
a little bit of Turkey and a lot of
Turkey Brendon
Turkey first what you're gonna do is
take a little bit of bread and you're
going to want to cut the crust off of
your bread just okay okay gone we did
eight on the scraps Brenda we got some
leftover now you have a little bread
patty like this and you're gonna go
ahead and cut it in fours I swear to God
if she's eating it with paper cutter and
jela I'm gonna lose my you have what we
would like to call mini little
sandwiches and you're gonna take a
skewer and then next you're going to
take your string cheese and you're just
gonna cut alike so I actually gave
Shirley this recipe it was my very own
ground as well okay and that's gonna
cook um I did not see their I don't want
us to send man one right and then you're
gonna take a little bit of Turkey
my mom Brenda how much turkey do we have
left in the container we have plenty for
me mm-hmm and I can afford to you oh
don't cut me somehow it's hard to resist
then you're going to take your skewer
and very easily put on a piece of bread
first
alright and then put on a piece chase
paste Turkey you move a little faster
Brenda audiences snooze them and up
bread cheese maybe two pieces of Turkey
you're looking a little lamp there Hey
and there you have a skewer sandwich
easy peasy lemon squeezy now if your
child has been in violence in the past I
do not necessarily recommend making them
skewers for their lunch because Brenda's
son has been in and out not a it out
leave him after the friendlies go ahead
get me got pepper I do not want water
for me and dr. pepper no Charlie needs
her energy I have freedom therefore we
start filming you are nothing shy of an
animal and there you have some turkey
sandwich skewers if you're a little bit
on the plain sides and now we're gonna
smash things up a little bit and move on
with a ham sandwich very creative and
original I'm doing it first what you're
going to need for the ham sandwiches
it's just a little bit of bread right
cheechee tomatoes and hay
oh great
all right y'all step I'm going to take a
skewer and some tomato we're gonna put
that in put in a bread and then put in a
lot of ham and then a lot of cheese and
then go back to a ham and then back to
church I got it get off my back I had it
with you you done it for the patching
right get alright start this now they're
not dried up it is not a blonde hair do
not put that on me and then we're going
to put some ham put in another piece I
did it I didn't tell her to do this
another piece of ham another piece that
you I like my silly little if y'all get
fully loaded then go ahead and top it
off with a tomato and this is how you
get this beautiful skewer with a hint of
health from the berries of the veggie
farm for our last skewer we're going to
be doing peanut butter jelly and burries
this is a very sweet and healthy option
for you guys now Brenda you are not used
to healthy by any means whatsoever and
so with the peanut butter and jelly all
you will need is a little bit of bread
right a little bit of berries and you'll
need a little bit of peanut butter jelly
and of course I'm sorry she's so stupid
y'all gonna need some jiffy jiffy
Welch's Welch's and some raff of berries
right rads up there is all you need to
do is to dig your strongest finger in
the peanut butter and get a different
one out AHA baby this is how we made it
back home and you're just gonna make
that sandwich
or you can take the clean brand away cuz
you know I've been a culinary chef for
35 years
Brenda has never once in her life cooked
in the restaurant but I've cooked our
home and that's all that matters where
it come from the home and number one to
heart and then you're gonna dollop some
jelly on there I like strawberry but you
know beggars can't be choosers baby this
isn't your episode Brandon if it would
you could have strawberries and you're
just gonna spread that jelly this is so
easy I hope to tell you how to make it
it's just super easy just put the bread
right on top and what we're gonna do is
take some scissors just cut this it's a
fun easy way bring back your line I cut
my cat toenails with those scissors I
was trying to hand you these so then
you're just going to want to cut the
crust you'll cut the sandwiches into the
little squares we just found it easier
that if you made the key nut butter and
sandwich first without eating it so you
could get it on the skewer that it makes
it easier to cut we're just going to put
the sandwich on it and then that way you
can put your berries on it just
whichever way you would like to I'm
going to add a red berry I'm going to
add a couple of black berries that is a
blueberry as the day is long it's very
I'll be I will be declared cheese
Junktown and you just make the sandwich
every which way that you want to make it
that's about the cutest fun sandwich I
did ever say I'll make my a little more
visually Instagram Pinterest appealing

the skewers I mean you can add some
