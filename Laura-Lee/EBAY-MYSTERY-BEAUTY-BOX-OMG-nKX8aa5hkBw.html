channel today's video is going to be
something that I've never done on my
channel because I just discovered this I
was on eBay and they have these mystery
beauty boxes so basically you pay a
certain rate and then you get a box
filled with beauty products and they
also have different ones like mystery
stuff which I will open one of those my
vlog channel or leave logs if you
haven't subscribe to that channel
subscribe oh I bought a beauty one this
one was 50 bucks oh my gosh and it just
came in this and Thai open the side of
it and yeah he peeked inside so he may
know something's inside
I promise scouts honor I did not peek
inside this box so it wasn't so we're
gonna open it in find out what's inside
and see these boxes are worth the wild I
mean they're obviously not all the same
but that's what we're gonna do today
okay I'm excited like what if there's
some good stuff in here that I need in
my life there could be you never know so
without further ado we're gonna sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and then we're gonna jump
right into this video be sure and
subscribe to a channel before you leave
subscribe now let's jump right into this
cabs already popped oh my god it's like
look guys it's like fill to the top
oops we lost something okay shall we
begin the first item I am pulling out is
I know and oh it's a it's a head wrap
it's a head wrap like this workout girl
and then you also got a little twist tie
to hold your hair back while you're
doing makeup which I will actually use
that and I think that that one's kind of
simple but cute you get some holler otic
acid it is an aloe oh it's an eye cream
with HollyRod acid in it I am not
familiar with this brand I will try to
look it up and see it's any good or any
reviews then we add some more randoms
Korean red ginseng pure extract road to
health what is this I mean I'm still in
the mystery phase cuz I still don't know
what these products exactly are or do
let's open it up
100% pure extract oh it's in the little
glass jar let's give this sniff aru's e
protects like caca Oh stinks okay I
won't use that probably oh my gosh I
just pulled out oh this is cool
electronic football this is gonna carry
I like it okay it comes with a charger
the cover a cleaning brush and then the
roller so basically it is a brush to
clean the dead skin off your feet oh
it's rough like it's super rough Wow I'm
assuming it takes batteries but we'll
turn it on to give it
girl you already know oh wow look at
that
I like it okay
I think big batteries are included in it
oh my gosh okay that's cool and it comes
with oh it's charged no her so there's
no battery so it's already charged and
it comes with the two rollers I like it
next we got some ohm the body shop which
is a brand that I'm aware of some
vitamin E moisturizing cream maybe we
can put these on my put this on my
tootsies oh there's Revlon in here okay
I have this already but it is a Revlon
mascara and it's still in its package so
that's cool so it looks like we got from
origins which is a brand I'm aware of
but it this just box looks old but
that's just me I don't know that it is
actually old but it says is a mix mixing
mask a hydrating one and like a clay
mask so you mix them together let's open
it up shall we clear an improvement one
is activated charcoal to clear pores and
other is an overnight in quenching mask
oh look you get two of them that's nice
origins is a nice and brand and I will
use this so that's cool so hydrating I
like that
next up we got a doll a beauty liquid
matte lipstick it is this maroon shade
right here
mystery box have any of you guys ever
done a mystery box okay not so bad
Oh streaky but it's not that bad
nothing nothing crazy so that is our lip
color from dolla Beauty this is Shane
joy and then we got Oh a buck cream this
box is all about scaly feet oh my gosh I
wear socks every day and like I don't
know if that helps that my feet are
pretty pretty soft as it is but now I
got some foot stuff so I don't really
have
like foot stuff but anyways I don't know
this brand you guys might know it I'll
hold it up but and it's a little bit
dirty but that's okay I'm conditioning
or do Nate's removes cow's skin it's not
true on clean Wow
callus remover so I think it's cool they
put this in the box see where it's a
little dirty but I will it's it's closed
or if it's sealed it's still so we're
good we're good but so you could
probably maybe put this on your foot
first and then use the scrubber which I
think that that's pretty cool so that's
that's fair this is like the brand's
logo right there naturally thirty it's
the brand and you guys know this brand
huh baby you guys tried this out cuz
please let me know so I know like how to
use it and what I mean there's
directions but you know okay
and the last thing in the Box is from
the body shop which again I know that
brands this exciting and everything is
sealed which I liked that and I like the
move but scrub you uh be that thing's
cute I want to look want to eBay like
how much that's worth maybe or like
Amazon or something I got this off eBay
but we'll see okay so this is a lip and
cheek stain so it's like a jelly in here
good jelly and then it's stain so we're
gonna okay and the color is again it's
from the body shop this color is oh one
alrighty you leave this on and then once
you wipe it away yep can you guys see
that it's stained right there
it's pretty cool so it works interesting
okay and that's all that's in my box
okay review I like the liquid lipstick I
like the jelly I like the body cream
haven't tried this but I'm interested
the mascara I will try let's open it up
and Boop open it up so I can show you
the wand on it it's the big fluffy one I
like that everything was sealed and I
thought it was pretty cool okay and then
we
oh the eye cream I didn't open so let's
just open it up for you know to have a
peek at it I really like the foot callus
remover oh it's like fancy knots the
packaging if I do say so myself my god I
cream looks like a moisturizer like a
thick nice and moisturizer so I like
that feels good actually my try this out
pretty excited about the only product
really out of the whole entire box that
I'm like girl I just anyways I'm just
kind of like is this love the event
