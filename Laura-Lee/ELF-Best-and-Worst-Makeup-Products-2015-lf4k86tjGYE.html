uh he smells like caffeine
thumbs up for cute kids how cute you are
hey guys and welcome to my channel
today's video is gonna be a little bit
of a different video on a scale one to
ten how annoying is it that every
youtuber ever always has a candle lit in
the background today's video is going to
be a little bit different because we are
going to be discussing products that I
love and products that I don't love from
ELF now I don't have like a Oh hatred
for any elf product I think the brand is
overall amazing and I mean I just think
they do a really good job and they set
an amazing price point for shoppers who
don't like to spend a lot of money on
makeup they have a lot of good quality
products which we will be discussing in
this video and then there's some
products that we're definitely misses
for me we'll be discussing those thumbs
up if you want to see more videos kind
of like this with different brands maybe
I don't know but we'll just jump right
in and get started with the video um
yeah I hope you're excited to see it cuz
we gettin started start with a product
that I love and then I'll go to a
product that I don't like I think maybe
that's how I should do this video yeah I
think that's how we're gonna do this
video
first item to talk about is super easy
it is these pallets this is the prism
pallets and I just love them I created a
tutorial with each of them on my channel
you'll have to dig around because
they're kind of old tutorials love both
of them I have sunset and I have naked
and they are gorgeous and there are just
like popping for the price I think
they're 10 bucks apiece you get six
different colors in each palette and
each color is a shimmer color so I do
like to incorporate maybe a matte to do
a completed makeup look but you don't
have to do that that's just my
preference you know you know to do you
there they're lovely palettes they're
definitely worth the price the colors
are creamy and the pigmentation is just
like wow that just didn't work for me is
the bate elf highlighter and I didn't
necessarily think it would work for me
because I use their baked eyeshadows
before gave this to a friend just
because they didn't work for me and she
liked them so I passed them along I'm
mentioning these products but that
doesn't necessarily mean that it's not
gonna work for you I'm just saying how
you widen more from it Oh Gert the
moonlight pearls highlighted more for me
one it was just a little bit like her me
into it was a little bit dusty and dry
so therefore it didn't last very long on
my upper cheekbone area it kind of faded
off throughout the day just because it
felt a little bit dry and I think that's
the reasoning for it to fade I think
it's a nice color especially for a
lighter skin tone or even a darker skin
tone whatever you prefer but I'm just
saying it's such a nice light highlight
shade that it would be beautiful on a
lighter skin tone um but it was a little
bit too light for me in my preference
and it does stood off easy so for me no
no oh I like the elf little primer this
is such an affordable product and it
works so well we're adding glitter to
your eyelid I think it's a total dupe
for the two faced glitter glue it is so
affordable it's just like crazy how well
it works is too but it comes in this
weird little lipgloss tube so what I
like to do is just get a little on my
finger and then dab it onto my eyelid
rather than applying this directly to my
eyelid girl your glitter will be popping
all day and all night long
this stuff I mean it really works I
would even use it as an eye primer I
mean if we're getting crazy we're
getting crazy but let me just let you
know that the longer it sets the
stickier it gets so if you are gonna use
as an eyeshadow primer I would probably
only use it the lid of my eye to make
the pigment from that eyeshadow on my
lid show up and maybe I see a cat here
on my nose blend out all my crease
colors apply it to the lid and then do
the lip color with it because it's not
gonna make a color blendable cuz it's
like an adhesive you get me you get me
product that I disliked is the makeup
remover pin and let me tell you why I
got this with the intentions of cleaning
up the outer edge of my wing milliner
indigestion
the total fell for me because the pin it
dried up quick and it didn't it like the
pin top got so dirty it was good for two
swipes and then then it was disgusting
and then this little top part just like
falls out and I don't know it just like
just didn't work for me whatsoever so I
don't I'm not gonna recommend it to you
guys and I definitely wouldn't
repurchase it Oh
while talking about a highlighter that
didn't work for me I have one that oh I
have two that do work for me so there's
actually the stick in lilac petal and
then there is this shimmering face whip
and this one is in lilac pedal as well I
love the color it's like this pretty
peachy pink shape I love this stuff I
think it looks so beautiful on almost
any skin tone could really compliment
you it blends out nice but it's super
pigmented I mean look at that yes honey
yes slay you little highlighter you slay
it even smells like fruit loops so I
mean there's just a bonus right there I
mean it is so razzle-dazzle beautiful
this would be more like a beautiful
spring or summer time highlighter I know
we are transitioning to fall and grow
you know those fall time makeup
tutorials are coming awesome cream
highlighter I love it
I'll try to incorporate it more tutorial
so you guys can see how I use it maybe
like an elf tutorial I think they didn't
work for me okay so here's the thing
we'll talk about two products in one
because two other blushes didn't work
for me whereas the other newer blushes
do work for me these are their elf blush
just
literally just this elf blush this is
Katie coral and melon mom I really like
the shades of them and I used to love
these blushes a lot they don't last very
long and that's my only issue with them
I think they have a beautiful
arrangement of colors oh um I think you
get a lot of blush for your money they
just don't last for me and I like I
really I don't mind the formula they
don't even feel that dry they actually
feel pretty soft it came out with these
mineral pressed blushes and I love them
so much more they're even more soft more
creamy more great colors and they last
so I would definitely buy the mineral
blushes over just the regular elf
blushes I used to like collect these
ones too like every time I went to
Walmart I would buy one because I love
this so much but blush is always the
first thing to go whenever you wear
makeup edit down I promise you blush is
always the first to go next we'll talk
about a product that I just live to
pieces and it is the elf matte lip
colors these are like little lip pins
they're nice lip colors I love the
arrangement of colors I mean you get all
kinds of beautiful neutral colors and
then well hello and then you get like
this little pop of color here I love
these these are awesome I mean they're
so pigmented and they are matte but they
are a little bit hydrating so they're
not too matte are in a drier lips leave
you looking across that crust day okay
because I have quite a few matte lippies
that leave me looking all kinds of crazy
hey my hair shades one of my all-time
favorites is Naturals Provine Pro Line
pair line Pro line I'm probably saying
that wrong and Lord knows y'all gonna
correct me I know y'all got me okay
neatly nude that I love a lot which I
would typically makes with a deeper
color lip liner because I never like my
lips to be like all one shade nude cuz
it's just like product it didn't work
for me from ELF is the mineral infused
face primer and I was kind of sad this
didn't work for me because I had high
hopes with it there's not a lot of good
drugstore facial primers out there I
mean I said it there's just not so this
one I do have a few that I like this one
is super silicone base and it is super
thick and I do like that about it the
only problem I had with it is I felt
like my skin look breezy from it I don't
have proof but whenever
a war I just felt like my forehead and
cheek area like it was just like too
much of a silicone a fill and it just
felt like I was sloughing off
I was just falling apart I was all over
the place with it so I never went back
to it and used it maybe I should but
mm-hmm didn't work for me Oh something
that I really do like from ELF and I
mean I got a little fussy with him at
first because not without but just like
me I guess I bust myself is these little
smudge pots from ELF so these are
beautiful bases for your eyeshadow like
I have a golden one a copper one and a
purple one so if I was gonna wear a
golden copper or purple eyeshadow on my
lid I would use these to set it as an
eyeshadow base to enhance that color
these work really well to do that the
only reason I got a little fussy with
them is because in the gold one I felt
that I ordering them online they looked
a total different color than what they
actually are but the gold one turned out
the exact same I don't know I think they
just enhance the colors on the website
maybe a little as does every site but
then when I got them I was like these
are the right colors come on man product
that didn't work for me from ELF is
there mascaras but I will tell you that
I'm a little bit picky with mascaras I
don't know why because I wear false
lashes all the time but I just feel like
I should entitle myself to be a super
picky critic of mascaras it's a teeny
tiny one which this one wasn't so bad
it's just meant to tightline like really
get up there and your lashes this isn't
really the one that I had a problem with
but the one that didn't work for me at
all was this hard brittle one and this
one is in buff black this one comes in a
little bit of a longer tube but I just
didn't care for it it didn't do much for
my lashes at all so I'm not gonna
recommend it I like that man I got more
blushes law jaysus alright so another
blush palette I'll mention really quick
that I did like this one is in light and
I love these blushes they're just like
the mineral blushes to me and I just
wanted to say that so these are some
orchid blushes they're lip liner pencil
is just bomb calm I've only tried one of
them I want to try more and I will be
trying Maura to remember to order them
the one I have in
is raison red rai si n how would you say
that Jason is our ASI right this one is
in Rason and it is such a lovely color
it is like one of my go-to colors it
reminds me so much of Veronica which is
a liquid lipstick from honest Asha
Beverly Hills these are so incredibly
creamy you could just use them all over
your lips and have a field day with them
cover your face with one if you will and
I mean they are just everything okay
mineral lip liners are like so creamy
they just melts onto your lips and they
last and they're fabulous
I remember to order more of these but I
highly recommend their lip pencils lip
liners another pod did didn't really
toot my horn is their foundation serum
and let me tell you why I only believe I
might be wrong if I say this but I'll
I'll just type if I'm wrong but I think
they only have three to four different
shades in this only what is that gonna
do the other thing I don't like about it
it's just so watery the formula it's
just like so diluted that I I didn't
really cover much of anything and the
last thing I didn't care for in it it
just like it just slept off my skin so
fast I really just didn't care for this
foundation the only thing I would
probably use it for maybe a day at the
beach because that's that SPF 25 in it
something like that but it just it did
nothing for me
so not going to recommend the foundation
it's product that I do like from ELF is
their High Definition powder this is
like one of their oh gee products
they've had forever
I've had this forever it's lasted me
forever how many times can I say the
word forever forever forever forever
isn't clear it is awesome translucent
powders begin crazy at Sephora with
their high-end prices it's hard to find
them in drugstore they're actually
translucent with no color I know it's
almost impossible to find them at the
drugstore but the elf loose one is
really good and they make like a tannish
one two which is pretty good I like this
one better to set your makeup make it
laugh and to avoid the oiliness it just
absorbs that oh that was so gross s
product I'll talk about that I do likes
I don't have any more that I don't lie
I thought I did that that that was the
last one the foundation the last product
that I do like from Elbe is their HD
lifting concealer it comes on a doe foot
applicator mine is in shade brightening
which who doesn't love that it is this
yellow tone concealer I mean like really
yellow tone it does its job and covering
it doesn't get too cakey I really like
it I think it's a good concealer
especially for that price I like the doe
foot applicator makes it easy to apply
it comes in this little tube so you
don't get a lot of concealer but I mean
you're paying not a lot of money it's a
good concealer and I really like this
brightening shade is so yellow tone it
just works well for me um and then I'll
probably set it with a darker powder
because this one's so bright just to
even it out a little bit it's a good
concealer though I would give it an a
yeah I'm gonna give it a holy Toledo we
went over a lot of elf products today

and the bad and the ugly Mimmie hope you
