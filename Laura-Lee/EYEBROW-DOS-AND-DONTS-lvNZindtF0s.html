video is going to be a do and adult
video and it's going to be focusing on
what's looking a little ratchet on my
face and it is eyebrows eyebrows lately
have just become the most important
thing in the world and as far as makeup
goes and there are just a lot of do's
and don'ts and I feel very comfortable
making this video because I've made all
the dolls I hope you guys pick up and
learn something out of it if you're
doing some of the don'ts don't feel
offended if you like the way it looks
then keep doing your don'ts because
really there are no rules in makeup make
a business art in there are no rules in
art you're free to do whatever you want
but these are just some tips and tricks
that have helped me to achieve the
eyebrow that I want to achieve you
haven't already subscribed to my channel
you can click right here and just join
the YouTube fam Jam that way you don't
lose me out in the craziness of the
YouTube world we're gonna jump right in
let's get started
our first don't is an easy one simply
don't brush your eyebrows downward my
eyebrows naturally grow downward but
this just drags the eye down the do and
this one is definitely brush them upward
so since my eyebrows grow downward sorry
I'm a little out of focus but I like to
brush them upward to uplift the eye in
the eyebrow our next don't involves
drawing the lines you don't really want
to go with a harsh straight line
whenever drawing in your eyebrows um
this is just gonna give a less of a
natural appearance but do feather in the
product so what I'm going to do is go
naturally along with the way my eyebrows
grow and I'm just going to slightly
feather the product as you can see I'm
making several different strokes to fill
in the brows which gives us some more
natural appearance
our next don't is not squaring off the
eyebrows you don't ever want to create
any type of square or harsh line on your
eyebrows it can appear harsh and very
unnatural because the eyebrows don't
grow in any square motion or motion or
way but do create a soft natural brow
and by doing that again just use a very
light hand and feathering the product
following the natural brow line the way
it goes and creates soft curves and your
brows not actual lines in your brow this
one is a tough one for me because I
always make my eyebrows too dark it's
something I'm notorious for but this is
on associate dip brow and dark brown and
I used it for a long time and then I
realized it's actually too harsh for my
face it was making me look way too
defined so I backed off of the product
this is an important do that can
transform your whole face and that's
going a shade lighter than your natural
hair color so I switched over to medium
brown and my whole world was flipped
upside down and yes I just arrived and
no I did not plan that this is also
something I did in the past it's
dragging the eyebrow downwards so when
you get to the tail of that eyebrow and
you want to extend it to make it look
like you have more eyebrow don't go
downward it can drag down your whole
face it's dangerous I know to extend
your eyebrow to do is to actually extend
it outward going straight out instead of
dragging it down this can actually make
your face look nice and softer and it's
actually way more natural a don't is
don't go hard in the front and that's a
really weird way to describe what I'm
talking about but I'm talking about that
harsh brow in the front this is this
part is very tricky it's very tricky for
me but squaring off your brows I'm
putting too much product in the front is
definitely going to lead to a very very
unnatural brow so be careful but do the
light in the front meaning take your
pencil or whatever you're using and
flick upward and light strokes making
basically fake eyebrow hairs you're
gonna be very pleased with the way this
looks it's just so much more natural and
gradient looking eyebrow gels can be
tricky my friend so be careful using a
dark eyebrow gel can defeat
the purpose of going lighter with your
brow product because it can deepen up
the brows way too much and also don't
drag them downward just pull them
outward or upward but not downward do
replace your eyebrow gel with a lighter
or clear brow gel I prefer this clear
one by honest Tasha because you can't
really see it well you absolutely can't
see it at all and it holds the brows in
place a big one is don't over plug which
in my childhood I basically had two
strings going across my face for
eyebrows it was terrible
a trick I like to do to lightly pluck
the eyebrows is fill them in first and
then I will pluck the sparse little
hairs around the eyebrows that way I
know I'm not plucking any important
eyebrow hairs back hope you guys enjoyed
