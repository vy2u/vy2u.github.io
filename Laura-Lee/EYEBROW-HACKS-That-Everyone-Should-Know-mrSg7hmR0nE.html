video is going to be a hacks video I'm
like super tan right now because I did a
photo shoot with Vida Liberata and they
spray tan me and I look super good and
I'm like oh thank god I need a tan this
way so I'm going to show you guys I
called my personal favorite hacks and
maybe a couple of hacks have learned one
along the way that may help you grow
your brows out groom your brows how to
fill your brows in and also if you
haven't seen my brow tutorial on like
how I do my eyebrows I'll link it down
below so you can check that out if you
want to you know actually see a tutorial
on brows it's gonna be brow hacks
remember brows are supposed to be
friends not twins
some days my brows are just enemies
maybe the first to admit that back in
high school I used to pluck that hell up
out my brows and I had like two little
pencil thin lines if they've gone
through hell and high water and here we
are today they're better okay sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
so you don't miss out on my hacks videos
and all my mini um and all my mini crazy
things that I do in say in my videos
okay let's jump right in let's get
started yeah put our first brow hack it
involves a mirror so mirrors are
actually quite tricky whenever it comes
to brows if you use one really close up
and where you can just see your eyeball
in your eyebrow you could very possibly
make your eyebrows too dark or too big
or too little you want to be able to see
your whole face yeah I just realized my
mirror was dead right here it doesn't
light up anymore girl anyways yeah you
want to be able to see your whole in her
face whenever you do your brows that way
they're symmetrical and they frame your
face nicely
our next brow hack involves the shaping
of the eyebrows which we're going to use
a fork for which is very strange best
thought off Instagram we're going to
give it a go so what you like to do is
what you need to do not what you like to
do is to line your eyebrows up with your
nostril just going straight up and you
mark it obviously I'm using the other
end of the fork and then you'll line
your eyebrow up with your nostril in the
center of your pupil and mark the center
for your arch and then you will line it
up with your nostril and the edge of
your eye and market and then you take
the actual fork and you will just mark a
few places through your route eyebrows
and you'll brush up for that gradient
faded effect in the front of your brows
you can even go ahead and line
underneath to get that perfect straight
line underneath your eyebrows and then
feather it out with a spoolie and then
you will connect the dots so this
actually worked pretty well as impressed
by this one so I Carol you know bring
the fork in for our brow hack number
three it involves concealer so I like to
carve out and clean up any mistakes that
I've made in my eyebrows with a little
bit of concealer you can even use
foundation juices nothing fancy going on
just take a little synthetic brush and
just draw and clean up under the brows
and get them good defined girl you'd be
ready to go
bright never full so you can actually
use a light highlighting shade like this
one this one's called sugar out of my
violet Mouse palette you can pop it onto
your brow bone and this one actually
almost give you a facelift it will lift
your brows and give you a more youthful
look so most makeup tutorials you see me
do this and that's his wine for eyebrow
hack number five you don't have to spend
money on those fancy eyebrow powders and
I should have worked just as well so I
used the brown powder out of my palette
actually mixed bubs and whiskers
together which are the two dark brown
colors and just an angled brush you can
set your eyebrows or fill them in with
the powder you don't need nothing fancy
girl or boy whoever is watching out
there
for bra for bra O'Lord I'm losing it for
real hack number six and involves
plucking so the cool thing that I like
to do in pluck is to do my makeup
filling my brows and then I will pluck
the hairs that's left over instead of
plucking a bare brow because you don't
know which hairs you need a plug and
which ones need to stay because we all
know if you pluck a brow hair it ain't
coming back unless you don't want it to
for brow hack number seven it also
involves plucking so a hard and fast
rule I to learn is to get rid of the
magnifying mirrors they are like the
number one cause for over plucking your
eyebrows because you can see too much
get a mirror or you can see your whole
entire face for brow hack number eight
it involves hairspray girl you just
hairspray your whole face be ready to go
mmm a little overreacting you know just
kidding what I'm gonna do is hairspray
the end of a spoolie and it will cause
your brows to stick down and you do not
need a fancy eyebrow gel or let's say
you forgot your eyebrow gel whatever the
case is this works just as well if not
better than an eyebrow gel just without
the hairspray let it go girl mm-hmm they
ain't moving for brow hack number nine
it involves my facial razor which I did
a full video on this already but you
know um so you can use a face razor to
clean up your brows if you're tired of
the pain from plucking because we all
know it doesn't feel good so you can
just clean up your brows however I will
warn you your eyebrows will grow back
quicker because you're shaving them and
still pulling them out but hey it works
for brow hack number ten it involves
your eyebrows shocking right no and if
I'm lightening your brow so let's say
you accidentally filled them in too dark
and you don't want Sharpie looking
eyebrows all you have to do is take a
blonder or lighter color brow gel gel or
powder and pack it onto the brow and it
will get them a little bit of a lighten
color for brow hack number eleven and
envelopes cash roll which I realize this
is a laxative so that's so awkward so
I'm pretending to apply it on my brows
because you actually apply it onto your
bare brows with no makeup on at night
you can apply this to your brows and
lashes and it will help them to grow
thicker and this stuff works you can get
it at CVS that's where I got mine so
awesome do it every night be consistent
and
watch your brow sprout thank you guys so
much for watching subscribe before you
leave and I'll see you in my next video
