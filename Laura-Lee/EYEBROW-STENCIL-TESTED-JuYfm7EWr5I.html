those dentist things that holds your
mouth open
oh hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be where to go
hey guys hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is a job hey guys welcome
to my channel today's video is going to
be a review demo tested out does it work
this looks like it was going your vagina
I don't know why it just looks like
something a gynecologist would use but
really we're going to be reviewing this
eyebrows stencil and you're supposed to
just like put it right there and be able
to draw on beautiful eyebrows when I
test out see how it works it isn't worth
the toot I don't know I've never tried
it before I think I saw it on Etsy
nose-picker
gynecologist tool before you leave or
get into the video be sure you subscribe
hit that red button down below to my
youtube famteam today yeah yeah let's
jump right in and get started I got
really close up and personal because
we're gonna take my eyebrows off first
it's not even a good eyebrows a honestly
so I'm not even mad about this come on
little eyebrows at the moment we've all
been waiting for because my head is an
y'all what I did to drew these on just
like straight like them Hobbit I am
gonna kind of line it up with my eyebrow
you know make it sensible like any
person would do just fill that in and
see if what kind of eyebrow we get mmm
this is really close up to my face first
I'm going to be using my benefit
precisely brow pencil and number four
this is pretty much what I use every day
to fill in my eyebrows we are going to
line it up it's hard to get the pencil
down in there I don't think this works
with a pencil I think this is just meant
for brow pomade pomade or powder because
like the pencil tip won't go all the way
in so you know what this is kind of a
fill with the pencil I'm going to go
ahead and try it with my honest russia
beverly hills dipbrow pomade
and shade medium brown and I'm going to
be using the Sigma e65 brush to figure
this out this is a real biatch to get
lined up I'm on the struggle bus today
guys with this so I have it filled in
like pretty much completely like laying
dead on my face it's not that bad
thank you really provided some guidance
I fill my brows everyday so I pretty
much have that down trying to fill in
this like random gap of hair that's
missing get in there
the overall result is not that terrible
it's not per se exactly how old filling
my brows maybe you could even run a
spoolie through it and the end is soften
it up aren't that terrible like I'm not
that upset with this product I thought
it would be way worse I wish you would
like fit on my face but as you can see
it like hangs off and it's definitely
not like universal because not
everybody's eyebrows it like that but
you can totally slant it sideways and
like pin it to your face and then lock
it in and fill in the brow the brow
pencil definitely didn't work as well
but the Britpop made hey let's try this
one did work better I don't know how
this eyebrow turned out worse but it
definitely is a little bit janky like I
definitely think it helps provide
guidance and what you could also do with
this tool is hold it on there and just
draw notches like okay they should start
here they should end here here's the
center and then fill them in so I think
the tool be really cool for that it was
so incredibly affordable and it's like
nothing to it so I thought I would try
it out for an eyebrow stencil I
personally like to freehand my eyebrows
it might have helped me get started
drawing my eyebrows if you want to get
started filling in your eyebrows you
don't know where to start
it could help I don't think the product
was completely a poop I'm not obsessed
with my eyebrows and I don't
see missile using it on the right layer
but like I said I've been filling in my
eyebrows for a long time so I think this
is a great tool for beginners like this
needs to be brushed out let's brush it
up um that that's a situation like I
said it could like help you create like
a guideline and getting your brows right
I think I have like an abnormally small
head and face I'm telling you guys it
may look normal on camera but like caps
in sunglasses and more things they don't
fit my head so I think it is going to
fit the average person's head better
than my head my head's just weird okay
anyway so yeah that's it for this video
short and sweet and we discovered the
eyebrow stencil does it work it kind of
works it's a great guideline and it's
great for beginners that's just about it
though I hope you guys enjoyed this
video be sure and subscribe to my
channel before you leave adios amigos
bye my friends I think that's what that
means in Spanish I'm learning and I'll
see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
