video is gonna be a little bit different
than most of my makeup tutorials because
I haven't listening to you and you guys
have been requesting that I do a look
for beginners with no false lashes these
bad boys are mine mm-hmm I know you see
them actually kind of mascara they've
been liking a lot and you probably see
me using the past couple tutorials but
this is the grandiose extreme mascara by
Lancome and boom look at that one though
okay it has really helped my lashes
stand up and fill them in so it also
kind of inspired me to do a look without
false lashes I hope you like it but
anyways I wanted to do this tutorial for
y'all because sometimes I forget like
you get I get on YouTube and I do these
ba-ba-boom Instagram makeup or all this
heavy makeup looks with a hundred steps
and I forget not everybody once that
maybe somebody wants to take it easy
learn a few tips and tricks some people
are young and they don't want to wear
that much makeup or some people in
general just don't want to wear that
much makeup and I really wanted to make
this tutorial for you I think this is a
great learning tutorial if you don't
know much about makeup and I also think
this is a great tutorial for school or
for work or just like a quick little
5-minute makeup tutorial so I hope you
do enjoy it uh-huh I hope you enjoyed my
real lashes too
be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave because if you don't
you could miss out and we don't want you
to miss out on this craziness okay
starting out I like to pry my skin and
all primers are different for everybody
depending on what your problem areas are
I have pores in this area so I'm just
taking the poor vanishing stick and I'm
going to pop it all over those areas and
blend it in then I'm going to go in with
my L'Oreal infallible pro Mac foundation
ohmicide concealer and I'm going to
blend it out with this artiste brush
next up I'm going in with my Born This
Way concealer and I like to plate this
in the under eye area to brighten and
push out the area as well as on my nose
always talk about blending out with my
fingers if I don't have a brush on hand
and now I'm actually going to show you
me doing it in this video if you don't
have brushes no worries you blend out
your face makeup with your hands all
throughout high school I actually
blended out my foundation
every single day with my hands next I'm
going to be going in with this banana
shade from honest Asha Beverly Hills and
I'm going to be sure and set every where
I place the concealer if you set your
makeup it will last longer then I'm
going to be using my palette I created
with violet boss and this blending brush
this is an e 38 blending brush I'm going
to pack on breeches which is a topi
brown color and I'm going to slowly
blend it in a circular motion on the
outer corner and you can softly buff it
inward and you can kind of blend it in
the crease avoiding most of the eyelid
if you get some on your eyelid it's
totally cool just keep going I'm going
to take a little bit of a shorter shader
brush and a matte lighter shade any
light shade you have on hand will work
I'm going to gently pack this on to the
lid and just swipe back and forth not
getting too much of it in the crease
then you can take your blending brush
and just soften up that edge but no
color or just a little bit more color on
it if you want and that is it for the
eyes guys and I think it's just a soft
natural easy peasy lemon squeezy look
great for beginners great for 5 minute
makeup I don't know why I'm dancing
moving on for the star of the show we're
going to be doing our lashes first I
like to curl my lashes I give them about
two curls on each side to lift them then
I'm going to take this liner add a
little bit on a flat brush you can put
the liner directly on your eyelid this
part is a little bit easier if you have
trouble getting your liner right I'm
just going to buff it into the lash line
to define the lashes this way it makes
the lashes look fuller and it makes it
where you can't see your skin next is
for lashes I'm gonna be using the
Lancome grandiose mascara that I
mentioned in the intro this product is
going to be sold in July only at Ulta
beauty it's going to be online June 30th
and in stores July 1st
they'll market calendars as this cool
bit one which makes it easy to apply the
mascara to your left and your right eye
I like this mascara because it's a nice
matte black shade and I like that
mascaras be very black to build up my
lashes and as you will be able to see it
definitely lengthens my poor little
lashes
and it lifts them up because my lashes
grow out straight it's very annoying so
I just applied two coats that mascara to
the lashes for my bronzing I'm going to
take a matte topee shade in an angled
fluffy brush I want to flicker the brush
downward on my face starting at the top
of the ear and then I'm going to run it
on the temples and just a little bit
around the top of the forehead I'm also
going to do a little bit of contouring
by running the smaller fluffy brush
right up the sides of my nose and all
around the tip of my nose just to give
it a more structured look and simple as
that we have bronzed at my skin I'm then
going to go in with the rocket or blush
and I'm going to pop it on the apples of
my cheek and I'm just going to blend on
back for a highlight I'm going to take
this exposed highlight from Tarte and a
fan brush from japonesque and I'm just
going to pop this upper to the upper
cheek area and a little bit right down
the nose and some to the cute bow as
well just to give my skin a very light
frosted glow next I'm going to take
sugar from the palette this part is not
mandatory but just if you want a little
extra I'm going to pop it onto the brow
bones with a small pencil brush this way
the product doesn't go everywhere and
I'll also pop it onto the inner corners
just to open up the eyes and make them
look more awake and get a little crazy
and add some to the Cupid's bow next is
for lips I'm going to pick still as
caramello which this is my favorite
liquid lipstick from them is a pinky
nude color I'm just going to apply this
all over the lips you can add any color
that you wish and that's it for this
video I hope it was helpful I hope you
maybe learn something I love you guys
and I'll see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
