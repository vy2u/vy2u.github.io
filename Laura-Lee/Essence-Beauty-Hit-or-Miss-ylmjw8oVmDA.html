guys welcome to my channel in case
you're wondering I don't have on a lot
of makeup because today we're going to
be testing out essence Beauty to see if
it is a hit or a miss SS beauty is a
very affordable brand I found all these
products at Ulta and um we're gonna
figure out what's a hit and what's a
miss so what's good what's bad at the
products I've already been testing them
out so I already have kind of a first
impressions on them and I'm gonna kind
of show you as much as I can with my
face also I wanted to mention on my
third stop on star studded September
with uLTA Beauty which is where I get to
meet some liberties at Ulta I got to
meet ariana grande hello I'm the coolest
person ever now no take a picture
together and she chose the Geo filter so
we went with the deer filter and then we
were there for her new perfume sweet
like candy and it looks like this and it
smells so good it smells sweet like
candy see what I did there I also got to
sit down an interviewer I couldn't
record the interview so I don't have
that recorded but I can tell you a
little bit about our interview um we I
mainly keep the questions obviously
about the perfume I did ask her like a
couple little questions like four if you
could forever eyeliner lipstick if that
was the only thing you could wear for
the rest of your life and she said
eyeliner which I agree completely and
then I had asked her you know if you're
running out of the house and you want to
grab a snack whoa to be she said popcorn
and then also I just asked her about her
um perfume a little bit like the design
of the bottle is matte pink this time
and she said she wanted to resemble like
candy cotton candy to kind of keep it up
with a theme which is so cute and just
little things like that it was really
fun chatting with her and then I
actually got to see her perform the next
night I Heart Radio so it was like we're
just hanging out all the time now it's
getting ridiculous we're like best
friends ariana grande was great it was
really nice to meet her and I loved her
makeup artists danuel so Daniel if you
were watching this what be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
for more craziness and let's get started
this is how I hurt my neck this is how I
hurt my neck in every video
okay so essence I went in section I'm
like wow this makeup is like super
affordable first thing that really
caught my eye was this cute how to make
nude eyes
make a box you open it you get a mirror
six eyeshadows aged shittaka lit up six
eyeshadows shades in a mini little box
so let's see first watch just being
honest it's not that pigmented
let's get another swatch room I'd you
these are finger swatches so the second
swatch was way more pigmented can you
see that look at that the first watch
was a little bit patchy so maybe some of
these colors are a bit of a hit animus
the third swatch there's almost no
pigmented - I mean the third swatch was
almost the same as the first swatch
nothing crazy happening I'm not dying
over this palette so far and we're like
movin fast team nude is beautiful team
nude was very pigmented
uh we got a nude night out new night out
is very consistent in color and it's
pretty and it's watched well and then we
got all about nude which is a gunmetal
looking color and it turned out nice so
really two out of these six colors in
the palette didn't swatch that well
which were these two shades right here
so overall that's a pretty decent
palette they give you this little brush
which something I typically don't use I
always just go to my makeup brushes the
only thing that I see about this palette
is it wouldn't really work for travel
for me personally because I like some
matte shades and these are all shimmery
eyeshadows so I definitely couldn't
travel with this palette but I think you
could get some pretty looks out of the
darker colors in the palette I'm really
interested in trying out this one again
they're all shimmers there's no matte so
I couldn't really travel with this this
one's called all about bronze eyeshadow
palette and they swatch even better way
better than the all about nude palette
they actually swatch pretty gosh-darn
well if you can tell so I'm kind of
digging this one I'm going to try this
one out on my eyes but honestly because
it doesn't have like a lot of mattes in
it I'm not going to be able to do like a
completed I look but let's just see how
they blend out on the eye with a brush
so I'm gonna take a little bit of this
one and this Real Techniques brush
I mean that definitely shows up you can
see that and this is like a brush not a
finger swatch I'm not going to lie this
is this is pretty I'm going to go in
with a little bit of the darker color
and then I'm going to go ahead and do
this eye a little bit so it doesn't feel
left out and sad and I don't look crazy
so this palette is definitely something
I could work with the other palette I'm
gonna be honest with you
just me and my everyday life I wouldn't
use this palette just because it's not
pigmented enough for me and it doesn't
have the range of colors that I need
this would be much more idea in my
opinion so this is a little bit of a
Miss for me I think the packaging is
just so darn adorable it made me buy it
but at the end of the day this one is
way better next I bought some essence
gel eyeliner it looks like this and I
went ahead and brought the essence gel
eyeliner brush so it's just a little
angled eyeliner brush that looks like
this and I'm gonna try to wing it out so
far doesn't seem dry and crusty I just
got a bit on the brush if this is a good
eyeliner it could be a go-to I already
have mascara on so I was working on
something earlier so this is going to
make this difficult so far it it
honestly seems like an awesome gel
eyeliner I mean that's super black it's
super consistent I just got started but
and it's matte so overall I mean the
liner dries really fast so if you take a
long time to do your liner you might not
like it I actually love that it dries
fast because it doesn't move around whoa
let's see how this brush wings it out
I'm gonna have to scoot closer no lie
this is a freaking amazing eyeliner
first impressions and that eyeliner
brush is key it has just enough density
to the brush where it's not too big not
too small not too flimsy like and it
just dried so Matt and I just created an
amazing wing that's a pretty wing you
can't deny that a plus eyeliner right
here alright the next product we're
going to try out by the way I put on
lashes so you know I wanted to add the
drama I'm going to try out the silky
touch blush this is in number 10
adorable
let's see how pigmented she is silky
touch is true this feels like pure
butter i swatched it and it completely
disappeared off of my skin it vanished
so I don't it appeared on the brush it
appears on your cheek a little more I
guess with a blush it'd be nicely
softly stipple it but once you rub it in
like hard with your finger like I got
nothing out of it there you go you can
really see that now better at first I
was like whoa I'm going to go ahead and
let you know that this is a shimmery
brush so if you have a lot of textures
or bigger pores on your face shimmery
blushes in general tend to make those
areas look a little bit or they move it
then magnify those areas you can see
texture on the skin even more so if
you're having problems with that I would
stick to a matte blush but these are
shimmery they're very silky and I think
they have a nice bit of pigmentation
very pretty with a blush I like this so
this was a yes for me next we're going
to try on one half of the face because I
have to contour like bronzing powders
this one is called matte bronzing powder
Sun Club it's really cute you get a lot
of product gonna take my angled brush it
seems to be coming off well pigmented um
it has like night Shane like my skin's
glowing a little bit and this is
supposed to be matte let's see how it
looks on the face oh oh whoo you guys
that's my fault I went in heavy-handed
so this is pigmented and pretty hmm I
put too much I like I got punched in
cheek kinda it kind of looks like muds
on my face because I went in with way
too much product
they use a light hand but just first
impressions using this I've heard good
things about this I feel like I've tried
this before in the past and liked it
it's good now we're going to try out the
contour powder it has a highlighter and
a bronzer here it is nicely pigmented
the contour shade it almost looks like
the identical same bronzer okay maybe
you know what it might be even more of a
gray undertone which is really nice for
my skin tone because the cooler the gray
the less orange I look and the more
natural the contour looks so let's try
it out so I'm going to take my other
angled brush dust some of it off and
then I'm gonna go am i recording yeah
you'll posit and honestly the color may
be just a little bit more cool but I
used it a little more I used it
correctly and I really liked both of the
bronzers they have good powder products
and we're going to try out the
highlighter which is this right down in
the corner honestly the highlighter
seems a little bit do you see that white
of the base metal it seems a little bit
chalky let's put it to the test on my
face it definitely highlights but it's
so so much of a highlighter I mean it's
coming through now so let me put it this
way my impressions on the highlighter is
that it it's pigmented highlighter but
yet it's really dusty and chalky
everywhere so I'm not obsessed with a
highlighter but both of the bronzers
were hit the highlighter was a Miss for
me I'm actually going to wipe off my
concealer all that stuff right here and
I want to try out their concealer so I
picked it up it's called
eye stage eyeshadow base because this is
an eyeshadow base and not a concealer
for whatever reason i legit thought that
that was a concealer but it's not so I
also have another highlighter that I got
from them it's called the pure nude
highlighter it feels just like the silky
blush
incredible pigmentation and a finger
swatch of it it feels really nice let's
see who does stay and then the blood the
brush swipe of it is right over here and
then the finger is over here um and it
looks beautiful it looks really pretty I
applied the other one all over my face
so I'm not going to try this in my face
because it would just mix in and we
wouldn't know the truth but this is
called be my highlight number ten and it
feels just like this will be blush the
light and it's very pretty
so this is definitely a hit for me has
anyone else read out their highlights
what do you think I next I got some of
their liquid lipsticks this one is
number Oh - beauty secret thumbs like in
this mini little tube with a little doe
foot applicator liquid lipstick but this
suck loss let's try to look law alright
so I think there is some confusion it's
just like a pigmented lip gloss I think
liquid lipstick is a little bit of an
off name for this because this does not
remind me about liquid lipstick this
reminds me of a pigmented lip gloss
weird that they would name it that I
mean I get a liquid lipstick doesn't
always have to have like a dry hard
finish but it's normally not just like a
pure gloss you know what I'm saying just
gloss guys look at that
that's just gloss I'm kind of
disappointed in that but a hit for gloss
a miss for liquid lipstick if you get
one saying you're picking up what I'm
putting down and then I picked up their
dip liner this is a waterproof liner and
I want to see if it dries shiny or matte
because of a dress shiny no it just
doesn't toot my horn I don't see I don't
typically like felt tips but that's just
personal preference very consistent in
color and even so it's not like thin or
too too watery I like that let's see if
it dry shinier matte
and the eyeliner the tell of it is dry
and it dried matte as it could possibly
be with that felt tip I cannot create a
well a well liner a little will on the
end of my liner that felt tip I couldn't
create a winged liner but if for those
of you don't wear winged liner you might
really like that eyeliner because it's
drying super matte bold very black
loving it I mean they are killing it
with the eyeliner and their bronzers
were awesome eyeliner kind of a missed
some of their eyeshadows kind of a miss
on liquid lipsticks a little bit
misleading because it's more of a gloss
but they had a lot of great products and
then some products were just a mist so
