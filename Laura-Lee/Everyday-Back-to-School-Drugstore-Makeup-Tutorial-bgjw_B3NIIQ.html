video is gonna be back to school makeup
who's ready to school who's ready to go
back to school no one all right I wanted
to do you guys some back-to-school
makeup and I recently did a no makeup
makeup look and it was a very simple
makeup look and Here I am doing another
one because in that makeup look I used
higher-end makeup and all my comments
down below were like Laura use drugstore
makeup so I'm doing a back to school
look using only dry summer makeup can
skip the winged liner if you want to but
the rest of it is pretty simple and it
looks pretty glam to me I have a mega
back-to-school giveaway going on right
now and I'll link that video down below
giving away a map book and after
watching so much makeup in school
supplies so be sure to enter I don't
think I have anything else for you so
let's jump right in the video for brows
I fill it in with this Maybelline brow
pencil in brunette already fill them in
because it takes me three years to fill
in my eyebrows next up I'm gonna go
ahead and start on my skin I'm going to
be using the NYX hydro touch this is
their facial primer and it's great for
dry skin the primer smells so good it
kind of smells like men's cologne I'm
diggin it I'm going to go in with the
Milani perfect concealing perfect
foundation in shade oh five I'm going to
take my morphe g36 brush and I'm just
going to blend all that out make sure
and get the ear and around the jaw line
that way you do not have any weird
streaks don't need anybody calling you
out on a foundation line especially on
the first day of school okay suede about
mid year to start with those foundation
lines there's a piece of hair in my
eyeball for concealer I'm going to be
using the Maybelline better skin
concealer I'm not gonna highlight my
whole face like I normally do
and all that jazz and I'm getting crazy
people we're just going to school I'm
going to take that exact same brush and
I'm just gonna blend it all out by doing
a stippling motion and this way it keeps
my undereye from having brush strokes in
it now I'm going to go in and set
everything with the Rimmel stay matte
this is a nice matte um powder and it
will help your makeup to last longer
whenever you set it with a powder and
I'm using the morphe 53 brush to do that
with I know that whenever you're at
school that you want your makeup to last
due to the fact you may not have a
chance to touch it up so we're just
going to press that product into our
under-eye now I'm going to go in with a
little bit of a bronzer I'm using this
one by Pixie this is their shape and
shadow bronzer which I do like a line
hate this f20 brush from Sigma it's just
a big powder brush I am NOT here to
contour my face for school I'm just
going to add a little bit of bronzer and
just add some color to my skin bronze it
up make it look like I had a really good
time this summer out in the Sun went to
the beach a few times maybe the lake the
river whatever you did with bronzer you
can fake it next up I'm going to take
romantic rose by Milani I really love
the color of this brush and then I'm
black and then I'm going to take my f15
brush from Sigma it's a stippling brush
I'm just going to dab it in there and
just I like a tiny pinch of color to the
cheek honestly whenever I was in school
I always skip blush just because it was
a step I didn't feel like dealing with I
didn't care my cheeks were rosy for my
highlight I'm going to go in with this
mega Glo highlighter from wet and wild
this one is in crown of my canopy and
actually subscriber sent this to me so
that was really cool thanks Pam for my
eyes I'm actually going to go back in
with this bronzer and I'm going to use
it as a transition shade I am OH
added a little bit of concealer onto my
eyelids that better skin concealers to
use it as a base for my eye shadow I'm
going to keep the eye shadow simple
because I am remembering we're trying to
do this in the morning when we're in a
hurry I also ended up dipping in this
wet and wild palette right here and I
used a little bit of the darker shade
just to add like a smidge bit in the
crease but I've also going to be going
in with the Maybelline Color tattoo this
one is in beige lustre is like a
shimmery pewter color I'm going to twirl
it on the back of my hand to get some
all like that and with my finger I'm
just going to dab this product on my
eyelid this is a really cool product it
gives you a little bit of playtime but
it does dry down really hard so your
eyelid won't be going crazy and melting
away throughout the day just a good
long-lasting product for your back to
school laughs I'm going to go back in
with my wet and wild palette I'm going
to grab a little bit of this shimmery
shade right here and I'm going to pack
it right on top of that cream product
I'm going to mix these two shimmery
shades together right here on the end
and I'm going to highlight my brow bone
there are two types of people in the
world you the love eyeliner you don't
fool with it so today I'm gonna be
adding a small winged liner if this
takes you too long or you don't want to
deal with in the morning simply skip
this step or you don't have to wing it
out you can just draw a thin line across
the upper lash line and that will be
your winged liner I'm gonna be using
this NYX matte liquid liner next up I'm
gonna go in with some liner this is not
our liner next up and we go in with the
falsies push it puts a OH
that didn't sound good push-up mascara
from Maybelline a subscriber had
recommended this stuff to me because my
wife she's kind of stuff but we're gonna
spend a little bit of time this morning
building them up I am still wearing my
pyjama pants right now
next I'm going to add a little bit of a
lipstick now you can just add a gloss or
whatever you're more comfortable with
wearing to school this one is called
honeymoon and it's by NYX is a very
pretty matte look not liquid lipstick
mmm it's very pretty matte lipstick
shade I'm going to spritz my face with a
little bit of this master fix by Marilyn
I'm not gonna help move to my mother
lasts longer okay
it stinks that's it for this tutorial
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you on my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
