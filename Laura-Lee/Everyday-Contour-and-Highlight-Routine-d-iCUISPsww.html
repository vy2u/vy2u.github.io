video is going to be a really easy
highlighting and contouring video it's
just something that I've been doing on
the regular everyday and I've been doing
cream highlight and contour everyday
because I think it just turns out so
beautiful but I do it in a subtle way
that looks so good and just rich and
pictures and it's really soft and glowy
on the skin it's not too harsh and it
 for me it's just as quick as a
powder contour routine and I'm going to
show you guys how I do it so I'm really
excited for you to see the video to see
that contour you see it also I'm doing
this humongo giveaway with pure
cosmetics on my Instagram so be sure to
go under this picture right here and
enter it's so easy to enter all you have
to do is follow pure cosmetics and me
and tag two friends below in the picture
and you are entered to win all dish make
good I'm going to show you my little
easy contour and highlight routine I
hope you guys enjoy and let's get
started there was lipstick I taped
during the whole intro to start this
tutorial I am going to go in with a
little bit of mad Mac natural radiance
facial primer and this is basically just
going to add a little bit of moisture
into the skin before we get started the
more moisturize your skin is the more
the product sets much better on it now
we'll jump into the contouring
highlighting part of this video which is
the most fun part of this video I've
been using my pure cameo contour stick
so it's a highlighter and a contour on
both ends and I've just been using this
basically for a daily cream contour and
highlight and what I like about it so
easy to use dual and also it blends out
into a powder so it's like a cream
contour but it's not it gives you the
benefits of a cream contour as far as
lasting a long time it will make you
look flawless and pictures and just for
everyday wear it's longer wearing it's
going to be way more easier to blend out
than it would a regular cream contour
because it blends out to like a soft
powder so first we'll start with
highlighting our face
I'm not highlight the areas I want to
push out in areas that I want to show
more of such I want the utter eye area
to be like plush and pushed out I made a
little on the forehead the key
suppose a chin and we're going to be
using obviously the light side I have
Benny I started off with the medium
stick which I have right here but now I
have been using the light stick I just
think this one suits me better and neat
I tell you that a little bit of these
goes a long way so you're gonna want to
do a triangle shape under the eye
because light shining down on you shines
down in a triangle motion versus a
circular motion so this is just going to
give you more of a natural look we'll do
a little down the nose just to give us
that nice straight nose and my forehead
is somewhat small I think it's because
my baby here takes over most of what my
forehead is I'm gonna do a bigger
highlight on my forehead than most
people if you want to make your forehead
look smaller then bring your highlight
down lower and you would contour more of
your forehead to give it a pearance of a
smaller forehead and I like having a
nice rounded chin and I'm also gonna do
the sides right here just to make me
look all structured I will work on the
consular side the kanto or sad roll my
little stick up a little bit I start at
the top of the ear for my cheek bone to
start so I'm just gonna rip pretty soon
I'm going to curve it around as you can
see I just kind of whoop instead of
coming straight down and not bringing it
down too far because I don't really want
to give myself a 5 o'clock shadow that's
never too flattering next I will go
ahead and do two straight lines down the
nose I'm going to do like a rainbow
around the chin and once we blend that
out it's going to give us more of that
rounded chin will do the temples where
the sunlight naturally hits and will
almost like touch that contour on our
cheek and then because I don't want to
really make my forehead look much
smaller I'm going to just add a little
bit around the forehead area and I'm
also going to go ahead and do the upper
lip because I love making the upper lip
look bigger by highlighting it excuse me
now that we have all the colors placed
strategically on our face to do certain
things to our face with shaping where to
grab our dampened sponge that comes with
this as
punjah actually comes with the contour
stick by the way so anyways we're going
to use the flat side right here and
we're going to blend out the highlight
first now when you're blending out be
sure that you're dabbing and not swiping
because you don't want to move the
shades around you want to make sure they
stay in the areas that you place them
because we place them in a strategic
area for a reason
now that our highlights blended out your
pace may look a little bit white but
that's because we haven't spread or
blended out our contour yet so we're
going to jump into doing that what I
like to do is use this like sharper edge
of it and really get in there to
precisely blend out the contour using
the same method of the dabbing instead
of the rubbing
I'm just going to do a little bit more
nose work right here and highlight and
contour my nose a little bit more
because I personally like it to be
really structured but if you don't I
mean make it your own you know don't go
back in and do your nose more
everybody's face is a little bit
different everybody has areas they want
to work on a little bit more so at this
point once you're done blending out
everything I would then go back in and
just touch up or add more take away you
know whatever else you want to do next
what I like to do is go in with a little
bit of my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I just like to set everything
that way we lock it in right now I'm
going to set everywhere where we place
that highlight
next I'm going to grab mocha by Mac
which has been my everyday blush because
I mean what an everyday color to wear
and I've just been popping that on to
the apples of my cheeks to give me some
meta fiying color like to highlight my
cheekbones on the daily if you don't
well then simply don't do it but I'm
going to be using the Mac oh darling
highlight which is just a golden
highlight and I'm just going to pop a
little bit onto the upper cheekbone area
just to make me glisten a little maybe a
little down the nose a touch on the faux
head and now what I'll do is I'll just
sweep away any of the excess contour
I mean contour any of the excess
translucent powder and now we have like
this really nice sharpen contour with a
little bit of blush just a pretty mix
and that is it for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed if you did please give it a
thumbs up I would really appreciate that
I love you guys and I hope to see you
all in my next video thanks rivet whine
Friday night never forget did how you
let me go no more lives I'll be fine

noon
