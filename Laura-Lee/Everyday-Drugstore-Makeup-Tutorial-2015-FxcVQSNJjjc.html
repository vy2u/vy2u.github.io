video is going to be eight everyday
drugstore makeup tutorial this Russia is
me on an everyday basis the messy bun
the neutral eye the Mavi lip yes it's
gonna be simple
I did add lashes if you don't like
lashes do not add them make this
tutorial your own I did ask you guys on
Instagram what do you guys want to see
for me give me video requests and a lot
of requests were a neutral look and
everyday makeup tutorial look and then I
got a lot of requests for Too Faced
chocolate bar palettes tutorials to my
sweet and the original so if you guys do
want to see more tutorials with the
semi-sweet palette or the original
chocolate bar palette please comment
down below let me know what you want to
see sometimes it's hard for our girl to
know you know just popping off with
stuff off the top of my head that I
think you guys would like to see I did
every single thing on my face with
drugstore makeup including these
eyebrows over here or a year off I found
a new part of my NYX that I love which
we'll get into in just a minute what
else do I need to tell you guys the
mailman kami just delivered some
packages and that's blabbering for me
we're gonna get started on this tutorial
and if you want to learn how to create
this everyday makeup well then please
just keep watching we are going to begin
this tutorial like any other with
priming our skin before we apply our
foundation I definitely recommend trying
out a primer I am loving this prime
master prime by Maybelline I think it's
awesome and definitely helps with a
longevity of your foundation now we'll
go into my favorite drugstore foundation
right now and is the Maybelline fit me
the matte poreless I don't really notice
that it helps with the pores but I
definitely notice it has amazing
coverage it does stay matte it blends
out nicely and it is very buildable and
I just love this foundation it's my
favorite drugstore foundation right now
then we'll go in with this new pomade
from NYX first what I like to do is
um with this next brow pencil in
brunette I like to just draw out the
bottom half that way I don't bring down
the pump may too low and then I'll start
with a pomade building up what little
eyebrow I have and I'll just add a
little bit extra to make them a little
bit thicker than they actually are
some people absolutely hate this but I
have to do it I'm sorry guys
next I'll go in with my favorite
drugstore eye primer the stuff is bomb
calm if you're looking for an affordable
eye primer this one is by Milani and I'm
just going to smooth this all the way
from the brow bone down to my eyelid and
I dumped my foundation out all over my
shirt and completely ruined it yay next
I'll go in with these Milani Bella eyes
shadows this one is Bella cafe and I'm
just using this as a transition shade
with a sigma e40 brush this brush is
awesome to blend out especially the
transition shade and this is also going
to help us have a smooth look and blend
out all the other colors were going to
use next we'll go in with Bella taupe I
did have to work with this color to get
it to show up like I had to load this
color up on the tip of my brush because
the first two times using it I couldn't
get it to show up and I was a little
disappointed but once I basically dug my
brush into the color I really started to
show it really started to show up in the
color start to build this is an e25
brush from Sigma and I'm working this
right into the crease to give a step and
then you'll see me blend it on the outer
V area which will go in and touch set up
a little bit later this is the main
color to this look and I love the taupe
color but like I said it was hard to
show up next I'll go in with Bella
champagne which is a beautiful pink tone
shimmery color and I'm just using a flat
synthetic brush to pack this onto the
lid
I didn't wet this color or anything it
showed up so well the Bella I shed us on
Milani or hidden misses I think some are
amazing some just don't come off that
easily like I said is a hit and miss but
now we're going to blend out a little
bit more of that Bella taupe color in
the outer V area like I said I would
just to build it back up where we
covered it up some with a Bella
champagne color this is just going to
give us a nice soft faded look on the
outer corner of our eye and it's also
gonna help make our eyelid eyes look a
little bit more wide
now I'll go in with Bella ivory and I'm
gonna apply this to the brow bone
actually this color showed up big time -
at first I was like whoa holy cow and
then I just blended it out and it looked
really awesome on the brow bone great
brow bone color you guys now I'm gonna
apply my favorite drugstore concealer
I'm using a lot of favorite products in
this video but hey why not this is the
master conceal by Maybelline and I use
the color light this definitely provides
strong coverage well as far as for me my
dark circles it really covered them
really well and very impressed with this
this isn't the first time I was using it
this I've done other tutorials using it
but I love it it's kind of a go-to for
me and I just blend this out with a
little morphe stippling brush here and
I'm also gonna clean up that outer edge
where the eye shadow came out a little
far now this was my first time using my
NYX contour palette and I did go in with
the shape of Nana because I ran out of
my honest Township banana color and this
is a drugstore makeup tutorial and I
liked it okay but I haven't used two
other colors yet so it's hard for me to
say if I really like the palette next
I'm going to go in my Physicians Formula
favorite bronze booster another favorite
product I know you guys I'm a little
crazy in this video but I'm just gonna
blend this on the cheekbones just to
warm up my skin and I'm also gonna go
ahead and bring it up to the forehead
area and then I also add just a little
bit down besides my nose that way my
nose is not left out and white-looking
next I'll go in with jetsetter buy up
cosmetics this is a beautiful mauve pink
color and with a light hand I apply that
to the apples of my cheeks we're gonna
wing it out but like I always say if you
don't like wing liner or you're just not
comfortable doing it just simply create
a thin strip of black liner on your
upper eyelid I really think it helps
pull the whole look together and to
define the eyes
now I'm going to take that first bill of
cafe color I'm going to blend out on the
lower lash line I never neglect my lower
lash line I just like to smoke it out a
little bit then I'm going to take Bella
taupe and I'm just gonna blend it on the
outer corner of my lower lash line not
bringing it all the way in and then I'll
take a little Bella champagne and I'll
pop it in the inner corners just to open
up our eyes a little bit next I'm going
to line my waterline with this black
liner if you want to do a light colored
liner by all means make this look your
own and do it the way you want to next
I'll add a few coats of mascara and like
I said in the intro I did add false
lashes by ardell demi wispies if you are
like there's no way I'm wearing false
lashes on a everyday basis absolutely do
not just add your mascara next I'll go
in with this beautiful lipstick color
this is the matte lipsticks by Milani
and this one is naked and ass
also added a NYX um soft matte lip cream
just to give it a little bit of more of
a brown look this is the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed I love you thank
you so much for watching and I hope to
see you all in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
