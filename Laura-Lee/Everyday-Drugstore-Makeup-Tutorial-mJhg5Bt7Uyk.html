of glam sash right here that I can wear
every single day very affordable makeup

oh I hope you guys liked the tutorial um
be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave I post a lot of videos
we got a lot going on here and I don't
want you to miss out on anything so hit
that subscribe button
join the YouTube fam gym jump right in
and get started it's gonna be a
voiceover so it won't be a lot of
chitchat we'll get right down to the
business starting out I'm going to go in
with my Milani Prime shield primer for
my face I like the moisturizing one or
the hydrating one because I feel like it
dries onto my skin but becomes tacky and
it helps the foundation actually stick
to the skin so I've been loving this
product next moving on to L'Oreal Lumi
cushion I love using this with my Beauty
Blender I just dab my Beauty Blender in
at one time and this is how much product
comes off because that cushion is
saturated and product and then I just
dab it out all over my face I love the
way this looks and by the way I am in
shade w 3.5
next I'm going to be going in with the
Maybelline best to prime this is an
eyeshadow primer and it works quite well
so just one you know you might want to
try this out and then we're going to
move on and we'll be using the NYX event
pop palette that comes with 10 eyeshadow
colors and its really pretty
we're going to start out with this
really nice warm tone sandy brown color
we're going to pop this into our crease
when the e-40 brush or to be using it as
our transition shade putting a lot of
emphasis on that I'm not sure why
next shade will dab into is the medium
brown color that's in the palette is
just a matte brown and then I'm going to
blend that on the outer corner in the
upper crease area just to smoke it out a
touch we're not going to go too crazy in
this tutorial remembering it is an
everyday makeup tutorial so I pretty
much only used three colors for my eyes
and then I go back and forth with a
blending brush in a 40 and 825 making
sure everything is soften gradient
because I don't really care if it's
everyday or just once in a blue moon my
eye shadow has to be blended to
perfection next up we're going to work
on the lid I'm going to take a 58th
shader brush and pop this champagne
shade on to my lid and you can wet it if
you want to look intensified or if not
you can just apply it dry is a very
beautiful color and it is absolutely
amazing for everyday now I'm going to
take that 825 and just soften up the
outer corner next up is winged liner but
like I say in every tutorial if you
don't feel like doing winged liner for
everyday makeup absolutely don't just
throw a thin black line across your
upper lash line then we will curl the
lashes and add some mascara I'm going to
be trying out this one by Maybelline
because it's supposed to help push up
the lashes and I thought it worked very
well however it did take a very long
time for it to dry and I ended up
popping on false lashes I normally wear
them every single day but again if you
don't don't wear them next up we are
going to apply some concealer I'm using
the NYX HD concealer one of my favorite
drugstore concealers and it is in cwo
for beige and I'll just blend all that
out with a Beauty Blender as you notice
I did not highlight my whole entire face
because it's just unnecessary for
everyday makeup we aren't going out
we're not taking a bunch of pictures
we're trying to live our life and I
didn't feel like I liked no whole face
then I'm going to set everything with
this loose powder from L'Oreal I wish it
was I don't know I feel like it was too
dark I wish it was a little bit lighter
but I just set all my makeup so that way
it last all day long and is
long wearing now I'm going to take this
palette from pixie you can get at Target
and I'm going to take a kabuki and I'm
not going to contour my face because
again that is just like a lot for
everyday makeup I'm just gonna warm up
the cheekbones drag it around the
temples warm up a face add a little
bronzer make it look like I've been sun
kissed a little bit and I really like
this bronzer because there's a slight
bit of shimmer in it so it kind of you
know makes you look luminous beautiful
hmm now I'm going to go in with
everybody's favorite blush from the
drugstore this is coralista coral ina I
can't remember but it's a baked blush
from Milani in its peach and it's pretty
so I'm just gonna pop that onto the
apples of my cheeks then I will go in
with these two highlight shades I
couldn't pick one so of course I choose
both of them and I'm gonna hop my face I
like to highlight my face every single
day because highlight on fleek that's
all I know but anyways that's what I do
in here now I'll go in with that light
sandy color and apply it to the lower
lash line
I never neglect my lower lash line um
just because I feel like the look isn't
complete and then I'll grab the darker
brown color and just fit that in really
close to the upper lashes that way we're
not too smoked out and I'll take the
lash accelerator which is a great
mascara for your lower lashes and I'm
just gonna pop that on
next up this has become one of my
favorite liquid lipsticks it is by NYX I
can't remember the name of it off the
top of my head but you know it will be
in the description box down below don't
worry and we're just going to apply that
to the lips once it dries it is matte
and this is the final look I hope you
