video is going to be my everyday fall
makeup look that she's just kind of a
go-to look for me that I would typically
wear every day the we think this look is
super wearable I think absolutely
anybody could wear this look it is super
neutral on the eyes with a little bit of
hint of color on the lips I did add
lashes and winged liner but you can skip
that and make this tutorial your own or
just take pieces from it do you do
whatever you want to do I did use the
ready-to-wear palette from ziwei in this
load this pallet launches the first week
of November however you can get it in
usual a match box there are a few of
them left for sell the box comes the
palette you can either get the warm tone
palette which is what I did the tutorial
with but the lamech box you can pick
whether you want the cold tone palette
in your box or the warm tone palette
whenever you buy it the box also comes
with a full size eye primer a full-size
eyeliner a mini lip gloss and a full
size tote bag the box is like a warrant
around 170 dollars and you can get it
for $55 with my discount code Laura
pretty easy discount code there they're
gonna sell out they always sell out
Robin while they're hot I'll put the
link down below this video is not
sponsored by iWay I just wanted to share
the deal with you guys I already shared
it with my snapchat family and let them
take advantage of it if you're
interested in getting your low-mass box
check it we're just gonna jump right in
and get started with this makeup
tutorial start out I'm gonna grab a
little bit of this lace color which is
just a basic cream eyeshadow color I'm
gonna blend out all over this is just
gonna help soften up the eyelid primer
and make the look easier to blend out
I'm gonna pick up this medium brown
color and it is called it Sahara I'm
gonna grab a little bit on my e25 brush
from Sigma and I'm gonna pop this into
the crease focusing it right into like
the socket of the eye and blooming back
and forth back and forth and then I'll
start to work the color up a little bit
further going back in with a little bit
of more of that cream color I'm going to
be applying this lace color all over the
lid by packing it on I am using an EVD 8
shader brush which is excellent for just
packing on color and getting the color
to show up really well and I'm just
going to cover the whole entire lid with
this
now grabbing that same 825 brush I'm
gonna go in with a third shade which is
just a little bit of a deeper brown
color and I'm gonna buff that right into
the crease right where I applied the
Sahara color and it's just gonna deepen
it up just a little bit I am using a
little bit less color that way it's not
like so much eye shadow it isn't like a
black eye I'm just gonna go in with a
touch of color on the tip of my brush
and really start to blend it back and
forth it yes girl yeah this next part is
like my favorite part at all times I'm
gonna grab a little bit of fire side
which is this deeper brown color it has
a little bit of sparkle in it
I'm just getting a touch on the e25
brush it's still using the same brush
and I'm gonna pack this onto the outer
corner of the eye oh this makes this
look just look so pretty really lightly
it just tapping it on using a super
light hand once I have a color applied
where I want it I'm gonna take a clean
825 brush like obviously my favorite
brush and I'm gonna blend it out just to
soften it up a bit and we'll clean this
little poopoo area up because I know it
looks messy but I promise you it's gonna
turn out good now I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of my morphe black gel liner
this has become my favorite black gel
liner because it is so black like it's
just like BAM with the eo6 brush from
Sigma I'm going to wing it out you don't
have to wing it out if it's not your
preference well then girlfriend don't do
I'm gonna go in with a little make-up YP
and let me go right along the edge of
the winged liner just to clean it up and
get that eye shadow off and once your
winged liner is sharp enough that it
could stab and kill someone and that is
how you know that you did it correctly
so next we'll grab a little bit of that
lace shade and we're just gonna apply it
to the brow bone right here and it's
gonna highlight our brow bone and just
give us a little bit of a lift and tie
the whole look together now I'm going to
work a little bit on the face and we'll
go back to the eyes I'm going to go in
with my better skin concealer by
Maybelline I'm gonna apply this to the
under eye area to brightness up and to
cover those dark circles and this out
with the f-86 tapered kabuki this is
really great for the under eye area so
it's got a nice tapered dome shape on it
I'm just softly gonna Pat this out brush
smells like caca I need to wash my
brushes I'm gonna go in with my NYX CC
powder in banana and my time to set the
concealer you see the f25 this is like a
tapered dome shaped little brush here
was really good
I'm gonna grab a little bit as a mineral
bronzer which comes in this palette I'm
just gonna contour the cheekbones word
of advice if you are gonna be using this
palette you use a very light hand with
the bronzer because it's very pigmented
I'm gonna start at the top of the ear
and I'm in a very small circular motions
just blend that in and my baby hairs are
taking over that dumb shaped brush I'm
just gonna apply my setting powder along
my jaw line and this is just gonna
sharpen up our contour I'll go back to
the under eye area grabbing a little bit
of Sahara with this what is this with
this a 55 brush from Sigma I'm going to
blend this all along the lower lash line
I'm going to take this flat definer
brush which is an e 15 and grab that
medium brown color mixed with a little
bit of fireside I'm gonna get really
close to the lash line I'm just gonna
softly it blend this in to my Tarte
inner rim liner I'm going to line the
waterline and then all apply some a skip
next I'm gonna pop on these shining star
lashes by Vegas nay and I'll or these
are drugstore lashes but if you don't
wanna wear false lashes build up your
lashes with your mascara and you are one
and done girl but for me it's just
easier for me to apply false lashes than
sit here for three hours and try to
build up what lashes that I don't have
I'm gonna go in with this little brush
here and just swipe away the excess
countin it for blush I'm using this
morphe blush palette here and I'm gonna
grab up a little bit of this center
color right here these are very
pigmented as well so be careful and I'm
going to dust this right along the cheek
or highlight I'm gonna grab a little bit
of this Camilla cream highlight and I'm
just gonna pop that on to the high
points of the cheekbones and bring it up
around the temples
guess I'm a crazy highlight panic I'm
gonna grab a little bit of Riviere but
honest Tashia and I'm just gonna pack
that right on top
my lips first I'm gonna line my lips
with suede by Mac and I'm gonna go in
with soft-spoken which is Nick's little
suede liquid lipstick
and last but not least I'm gonna spritz
my face with ten gallons of mac fix+
spray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
