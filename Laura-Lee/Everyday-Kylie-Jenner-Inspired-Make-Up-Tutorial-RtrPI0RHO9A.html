 on if I miss dying I know you
mean it when you say you love me but we
try and wait to hide you should think
that we wouldn't ask for we're going to
jump right in this Kylie Jenner makeup
tutorial without an intro or any
chitchat to start I did already apply my
primer and my foundation and then I'm
going to go in and prime my eyelids with
my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre this is
my go-to eyelid primer because it always
works so well and I highly recommend
priming your eyelids before doing it I
showed a look to avoid it creasing next
I'll go in with the toothpaste artist
palette by Vegas nay this palette is
Bobkov first I'll go in with the shade
millennial and an 838 blending brush i'm
kind of going ham on my eyelid there but
basically i'm just blending this color
all in the crease to give us a nice
transition shade and it's also going to
help soften up the eyelid primer that
way the colors aren't too sticky this is
going to give us a gradient effect so
any time doing a makeup tutorial i
highly recommend going in with a neutral
color in the crease just to soften
everything else up then i'm going to go
in with girls night this is a little bit
of a deeper brown color i did go in with
a really light hand whenever tapping
into this color and with a smaller
blending brush i'm going to blend that
right on top of millennial just to give
us a more gradient effect and to build
up some color next i'm going in with
this nude stick this is like when
they're bronzing sticks and this one is
in earth hmmm i forget the name but i
applied it as a golden base to the
eyelid because next we're going to go in
with this shader brush from sigma I'm
going to add Golden Nugget dampen it
with a little bit mac fix+ spray and
pack this onto the lid and that base
there is going to help this color stand
out a lot I'll have everything in the
description box so don't you worry then
on top of that I decided to go in with a
little bit of showgirl which is a deeper
bronze color but it's still super
shimmery just to soften up that yellow
tone color
next from quiete I think I said that
right this is her new gel liner pencil
and this is not even out yet but it's
coming out on the 14th of september in
sapporo and this is my first time trying
it out but i did like it this is like
their pencil but it's supposed to turn
into a gel
and it was interesting but it was a good
liner next I'll go in with the new
structural mascara from Sigma and just
apply a few coats to the lashes because
we are going to be adding false lashes
Coleen normally has false lashes on so
of course I always have false lashes on
but of course I'm going to be adding
them I went in with some by violet balls
these are some new ones and I just
applied those of course the upper lash
line with some glue if you're not
comfortable wearing false lashes girl
you do you and make this tutorial your
own and you just build up your own
lashes with a few coats of your favorite
mascara but as for me you know I love
that drama next I'll go in with the
Naked skin concealer by Urban Decay this
is one of my favorites it's great for
coverage I'm going to apply that to the
under eye area we are going to go with a
super super super bright highlight
because Kylie loves her highlight I'm
going to blend this out with a 57 brush
from Sephora but I'm not going to blend
it out too much where you can't tell
like I have this super bright under-eye
like I want to have that detailed super
bright under-eye on purpose I'm also
going to run some down the notes the
Cupid's bow in the center of the
forehead if you want to know a little
bit more about cream contour and
highlight I just did a video on it next
going in with the next CC powder in
banana this is becoming one of my
favorite products I'm going to pack pack
pack this on the areas that I highlight
it and this is going to really brighten
us up and it's going to help it not to
crease and to last longer then going in
with the new Stix sculpting pencil I
just got these nude sticks by the way so
it's just like I think I'm going to play
with them today
so this is the deep contour these are so
easy to use as you see I'm literally
like coloring on my face like a coloring
book and I'm going to go in with a 3d
kabuki from Sigma and I'm going to blend
this out this is not going to create a
dramatic contour but it is going to look
really good in pictures as Kylie always
does you guys know her Instagram be
poppin anyways and I'm going to blend
that out as you can see it's like a
really subtle contour next I'm going to
go ahead and dust away the excess banana
powder from my under eye area or the CC
powder and shade banana I'm going to
dust that away and whatever sticks is
left it's going to look how bright we
are we like so bright and happy and then
I'm touching up the nose with the nude
stick pencil in light and I'm going to
blend out that Cupid's bow next from the
same brand key I am going
and when their bronzer blush duo and I'm
going to apply the bronzer to the cheats
to kind of deepen up that contour
because with the nude stick it was just
so subtle and Kylie normally has a
pretty contoured face this brush is an
old medium sized blending brush which is
what I recommend when blending out or
adding a powder contour to your face
this one is by Sonia Kashuk and it's
from Target and it's old as the hills
next I'll go in with a little duo fiber
blush brush from Sigma and I'll be using
the blush that came in that little
quiete palette and applying that to the
apples of my cheeks this is a nice matte
kind of pinky mobby blush color and then
my highlight like blue out of the
container so I just stuck it back in
with my finger this is spoon by color
pop and I love this highlighter because
it's super light champagne E and
beautiful oh yes girl then I'm going to
go in with a little bit of millennial
and a flat little brush here and I'm
going to apply that to the lower lash
line not really smoking it out just not
neglecting the loan in our loaf not
neglecting the lower lash line then on
top of that I had a teeny tiny bit of
golden nugget to give us some sparkle
Palli typically always has her waterline
filled in with a white or nude color she
never really wears a black liner in her
waterline so I'm not going to wear a
black liner in my waterline this is
Tarte in a rim liner and I really like
it because it lasts for a long time next
going in with a little bit more of that
Sigma mascara I'm going to give a good
few coats to my lower lashes to make
them pop but I'm trying to be very
careful to make it clean and not to get
any on my actual skin then I'll go in
with this new lip liner pencil from
colour-pop
this is such a pretty color but it
didn't exactly match the actual lippy
that I said to wear or the liquid
lipstick I said to wear but it blended
out so well so I am way over drawing my
lips to give us that Kylie Jenner
appearance I over draw the Cupid's bow
we're going to connect it to my natural
lip and then over draw a little bit the
center of the bottom lip and then
connect it to the sides next going in
with serenity by Mannie makeup artists
what's up Manny I'm going to apply this
this is such a great Kylie Jenner lip
color and I really love it with this
look because it's just soft and pretty
and it matches almost everybody skin
tone like Hello
and we are finished I hope you guys

leave I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
