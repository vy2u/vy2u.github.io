like I know that Laura and today I'm
going to be using the Gwen Stefani
splash I'm gonna k-palette to create
this book I asked you guys on snapchat

palette look or if you wanted to see
they're gonna kay and just by a smidge
starving to k-palette won the race so I
might actually do a tartlet and bloom
palette tutorial soon because a lot of
you guys were requesting that and do I
have an ear now trench oh I will be at
gin beauty I hope you guys will be there
if you will be there I have a meet and
greet with the G way I'm real excited so
come to their booth meet me hug me love
me selfie me I will love you back I love
meeting you guys it's a tree little
cherishing moment in my heart and I mean
that very dead serious about that I
think that's why I happy you guys we're
gonna jump right in and get started
don't forget don't be stingy with a
thumbs up now
starting out I'm gonna get the main out
of my face so I'm just gonna clip I will
start with priming the skin I've already
done my eyebrows I have a very in-depth
eyebrows tutorial I will link down below
if you want to know how I make that
happen
I'm going to be going in with this you
way this is the anti-aging moisture
primer it has hyaluronic acid in it so
it's gonna help a girl out
I'm going to be going in with the new
Becca Foundation this one is the aqua
luminous perfecting foundation and
you're supposed to shake it up so we're
going to do just that I'm going to be
trying out shade beige I think I tried
shade medium before and I got a little
overzealous and I am NOT that dark
anymore so you just squeeze you this
stuff out um if I need to say one thing
about this foundation I loved it the
first time I wore it but like you can
apply it all over your face like this
and it doesn't have a very fast dry time
so I'm not trying to like rush and get
it spread out before it like cakes up on
my face I like that about it um and it
does blend out really nice
I'm going to get started on the eyes
I've already primed my eyes with my Mac
Paint Pot in soft ochre and today we're
going to be using this palette by Gwen
Stefani first thing I'm going to go in
with Stark which is just a really
neutral cream color and I'm just going
to blend that all do you see that this
brush was tainted oh and with a clean
blending brush and I'm going to take
that shade Stark I'm just pretty much
going to blend it from the lid to the
brow bone to soften up that paint bought
because Paint Pots can be a little bit
sticky sometimes now I'm going to go in
with this 825 brush from Sigma and I'm
going to grab Anaheim and I'm just going
to blend this right in the upper crease
I only have the color on one side of the
brush and I'm just going to blend it
from the inner to the outer corner
exhales hate the color of zone and I'm
gonna be a little bit more precise with
this color because it's a little bit of
a deeper Brown but I'm going to pop it
basically in the same area but try not
to drag it down onto the lid too much
and I'm just going to sweep that around
now I'll take this e45 which is a nice
dome shape brush it has like that nice
pointed tip and it's going to give us
that really precise crease area that's
what this brush is great for get a
little bit of Punk and I'll put it right
on the tip of the brush then I'm going
to hold the brush upside down and just
do the crease look at that it's already
pretty much give us a nice sharp crease
by doing that and not having color all
over the brush just have the tip of the
brush and just following it basically
the eyeballs socket so I'm going to
build it up a bigger grab just a little
bit more color you don't want to go in
with a fully loaded brush it's like a
loaded gun my friend pretty sure I've
said that before I had to get new jokes
but you don't want to go in with a fully
loaded brush you just want to get a
little bit on the brush and then go back
in and get a little bit more and a
little bit more you don't want to get
crazy because that's when mistakes
happen
now I'm just gonna take a clean 825
brush and I'm going to pop this I'm not
gonna pop it what am I talking about
here I'm just gonna really softly smooth
out the top part of that and not touch
the crease just right up here now I'll
just get like a smidge of black out I'm
going to do the exact same thing place
it right and follow that line that we
created beforehand just to deepen it up
a little bit
I mean legit a smidge it
I already got too much
they don't go back in with that clean
brush and just you know the routine
we're going to soften that up now I'm
going to grab a little bit of my Paint
Pot in soft ochre and I need a mirror
what I'm going to do is actually apply
this to the lid and then I'm going to
try to like carve out right wherever we
created that black line you totally
don't have to do this part if you don't
want to I just want my black line to be
really sharp but if you want your crease
to be kind of smoked out and not super
sized you can skip this step
I'm going to take this e 50 a which is a
flat shader brush and I'm going to pop
skip right on top of every where we put
the Mac Paint Pot this is like a nice
shimmery white color X I'll take a
little bit of my morphe black gel liner
and this is an eat-in liner brush from
sigma 810 I'm going to start by lining
at the inner corner and just bring it on
out and you guys nail it spoiler alert
I'm gonna wing it out
you
now what I did is at the edge of the
liner I don't know why I'm laughing it's
not funny but at the edge of the liner a
little bit my dark eyeshadow had come
off so I took this little f70 concealer
brush and just got right in there and
sharpened up the liner and clean up that
edge with a little bit of my concealer
now I'm going to go in with a little bit
of this Marc Jacobs mascara and I'm just
going to pop that on to the lashes
now I'm going to be using the household
lashes and smokey muse these are some of
my favorite bulb lashes at the moment
these are newer ones from house of
Marshalls and yeah I pretty much buy the
smokey muse in bulk because you can
reuse them but the chances of me not
losing them is slim to none I'm going to
do is going with a little bit of my Mac
Pro Longwear concealer f70 brush right
here and we're going to go ahead and
highlight our face or really cover dark
circles right here now I'm going to take
my favorite brush to blend it out the
f80 7 I'm just going to blend out this
concealer
al you guessed and I'm going to take
that laura mercier at translucent powder
and this little mini sponge shim dig and
I'm going to press it right underneath
the eye this is going to help everything
to stay put
it's going to help it look flawless I
don't really find that this gets too
cakey we're going to let that set there
for just a wee bit okay robot battery's
dying so perfect time I switch out my
camera battery and we're gonna get right
back to it no now I'm gonna take this
brush from Luxy Beauty this is actually
a brush from the powders in my throat
this is actually a brush from my friend
JD weighty 180 on Instagram she's like
contour crank queen crane mmm contour
queen and she created a brush line so
these are one of the brushes they're
really amazing for contouring and
setting like the whole face judge to get
ef5 brush and the bomb's Bahama Mama and
I'm gonna like I'm gonna like consular
you
take the f40 blush brush and peaches by
Mack was just like a staple color for me
I love peach on the cheek can you even
see it is my lighting too bright my
lighting always blurs out the blush it's
a real shame and then I'm going to take
a little bit of large Ehlers gilded
honey can't go wrong with this stuff and
I pop this on to the top points of my
cheekbones this is an f-35
well at least I know you can see that
highlight I'm going to go back in this
palette and grab a little bit of zone
I'm going to blend that all the way from
the outer corner to the inner corner on
the lower lash line this point you can
leave your lower lashline as it is I'm
going to add a pop of color but if you
don't want that you just pop off the
mascara and roll with it but I'm going
to add a little bit of danger I can't
resist dipping into this blue color
right here it's so pretty
I'll go in with a little bit my Urban
Decay like the what is this even called
this is the 24/7 liner light the glide
on this is a really nice liner finish
off the eyes by adding a little bit of
mascara to those lower lashes and now
I'm going to line my lips with later
Graham this is one of tarts new liners I
don't think this is going to end up
matching my lip color though darn it
it's totally not now I'll go in with
color pops beeper one my favorite liquid
lipsticks from them yeah they didn't
match at all don't do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
