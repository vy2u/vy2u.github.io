but very requested video I'm going to
show you how to do my eyebrows in this
video oh yeah so let's get started
first what I like to do is take a
spoolie and really only just like to
brush the hairs that I have up as you
can see I'm missing some places were
just eyebrow hairs do not grow anymore I
don't know why it has to do that to me
but it does then I'm going to go in with
my Anastasia brow Wiz and I'm going to
lightly feather and outline my eyebrows
I find that it's super easy to do with
the pencil rather than with a dip brow
pomade which we'll use in a minute but
just outlining them you can get really
precise with the pencil so that's what I
like to use this for also a good
alternative is the NYX micro brow pencil
if you don't want to pay as much I think
that one's ten dollars at Ulta but I am
just drawing up my ila eyebrows my
eyeliner when I'm throwing out my
eyebrows out as far as I want them and
just softly outlining them and this is
where we're knees the dip brow pomade in
dark brown I'm going to use the number
12 brush from honest Asha which is the
best brow brush ever I'm going to get
the smallest amount of the brow pomade
on the tip of the brush then I am going
to start to kind of trace that line just
to darken it up a little bit and then I
will go back in and I will fill in the
eyebrows so the key with the dip brow
pomade is to use as little bit of
product as possible because it can
become your worst nightmare if you get a
fully-loaded brush it's like a loaded
gun it's dangerous so then I'm just
going to fill in the empty area and make
them nice and bold and full brows if
you're a little messy underneath your
eyebrow like I am is totally okay we're
to go back and clean that up in just a
second so as you notice I didn't go all
the way from the start because I want
the top or the beginning of my eyebrow
to look a little bit more thin and
gradient that way it's a little bit more
natural so I start to flick up and then
I'm going to take the spoolie and brush
through to thin out the product even a
little bit more in the beginning and
then I'm just going to clean up any
edges that aren't as sharp next I will
go in with my concealer brush from Sigma
and a little bit of the Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre and I'm
going to carve out my brows that is what
this technique is called and it's really
just cleaning up your brows this doesn't
really make them look that natural
honestly but I love the way it makes
them look if you don't you can totally
skip this step but I always carve out my
eyebrows and then I use the Paint Pot as
my eye primer and just drag it on down
to my eyelid also this part can become a
little bit more time-consuming just
perfecting the brows and then where I
spoil leave them up it got a little
messy so I typically just rub a little
bit of the product and smooth it out and
once I have my foundation on it all
blends together then because my eyebrows
like to grow downward I have to gel them
up that way they're not hanging below
the product so use a little bit the
honest Tashia clear brow gel and that's
it I have done my eyebrows I hope you
enjoyed please give this video a thumbs
up before you leave and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
