hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be an exciting video I
did a lot of do's and dont's videos as
far as I did like the half out my
knowledge caught my nose it was just
like oh geez and don'ts videos as far as
the one with like half the faces I don't
have faces to do and then I did the
eyebrows do's and don'ts and you guys
requested the eye shadow do's and don'ts
so I was like I'm gonna give it to them
they want to see it and I'm gonna
with two I'm gonna go over some things
are gonna make your eyeshadow flawless
we're not going to focus on eyeliner or
eyelashes in this video I just did an
eyeliner tutorial on how to get perfect
eyeliner so you can check that out I'll
link it down below and we're gonna focus
on the eye shadow and just some common
mistakes that can be made we're also
gonna address a couple of makeup brushes
and how to get it right with which
makeup brush we're to use what makeup
brush today we're just gonna go over how
to get it right Jersey Mike's did not
sponsor this video but if Jersey Mike
wants to send free sandwiches my way I'm
gay also if you haven't subscribed my
channel what the heck are you waiting
for what the heck are you waiting for
that's all I'll say about that oh we're
inch up right in and get started I hope
you enjoyed the video and let's do this
thing
our first make up don't is neglecting
the eyeshadow primer if you have oily
eyelids it can cause your eyeshadow to
crease your eyeshadow will not be as
vibrant nor will it last as long and
also if you have discoloration on your
eyelid you can cover that with an
eyeshadow primer I should I do is to add
an eyeshadow primer it will do wonders
for your eyeshadow and completely change
your eyeshadow game here are a couple
good ones that I love next up is an
eyeshadow don't
so my first don't is don't go in with
the dark color without adding a few
lighter colors first as a transition
shade whenever you just dab in that dark
color with your blending brush and just
go to town on your eyelid you're going
to end up with a bit of patchiness and
it's not going to look gradient also you
can see around the edges is very harsh
it's quite unflattering on my eyelid and
looks extremely patchy and eyeshadow do
however is to add those transition
shades building up a shadow will do a
world of difference in your eyeshadow
game what I like to start with this
typically a couple different matte
neutral shades which comes in most eyes
shadow palettes and I start building up
lightest to darkest and it gives it that
soft gradient fill and it makes
everything easier to blend out and eye
shadow don't is don't go in with a
fluffy brush for your lip color because
as you can see the color is not nearly
as vibrant and it kind of poof's
everywhere a fluffy brush is meant for
blending not for packing on color so
just make sure you're using the right
brushes for the right part in your eye
shadow so an eye shadow do is to use a
synthetic brush looks like this it's
just a flat soft brush to go in and
apply a lid color if you're going to be
using a pigment like this I highly
recommend a do is to apply a base down
that way it's more vibrant and it sticks
to the eyeshadow base or you can wet the
color this also helps creating a little
bit less fallout so when I shadow don't
is to not add concealer right on top of
all your fallout to clean it up I
recommend taking a brush and dusting
away all that fallout that way you have
a clean base you're not just taking
makeup on to loose eyeshadow
next up an eyeshadow do is when using
dark colors you want to take a smaller
brush and get a little bit of color on
your brush and tap off the excess this
helps with fallout and it allows you to
build up the eyeshadow because you have
to be careful with dark colors if you go
in too heavy it's hard to blend them out
and hard to remove what you put on so I
always recommend just applying a little
and building it up because you can't
take away but you can always add on so
an eyeshadow don't here is the brow bone
using a light shimmery shade on the brow
bone you want to use a light hand and
add very little color or else and a
picture in person it can come off very
hard but yet and eye shadow do is to add
just a little bit of a light color to
the brow bone it can really lift the eye
tie your whole eye shadow look together
as well as if you blend too much dark
color too high up you can soften it up
with a brow bone color an eye shadow
don't is to not apply a light shimmery
color to the lower lash line it can make
your eye appear smaller swollen if you
want a blank lower lash line what you
can do is just put your concealer on and
add a little bit of mascara but just
don't add a light eyeshadow color down
there and I shadow do is to smoke out
your lower lash line so if you do want
to add some eye shadow to your lower
lash line the best way to do is the same
way you did your upper start with a
lighter color and then get a very tight
small brush and apply that to the lower
lashes not dragging it down too far
because you don't want it to look too
heavy on that lower lash line and for
our last eye shadow don't we're taking
it back to those dark colors do not fill
up your brush with a dark eye shadow
such as a black color and just go all in
this is how right Coon eyes are born be
very careful and remember to blend light
the softer you blend the softer your
eyeshadows going to look so don't go too
hard on your poor little eyes I hope you
enjoyed this video and I hope it was
helpful let me know down in the comments

hope you have an absolutely amazing day
