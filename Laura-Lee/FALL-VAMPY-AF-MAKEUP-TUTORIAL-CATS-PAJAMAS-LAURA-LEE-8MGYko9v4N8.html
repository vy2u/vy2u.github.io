channel I'm so happy you're here today
because today I'm gonna be doing a very
a fall time makeup tutorial can you tell
my background in my lip and my eye I
like it all time is quaking now actually
guys on Twitter what look you want to
see and everybody said a cranberry
smokey eye so I decided to do and look
the involve quite a bit of cranberry but
I add a little bit of extra to it
because Manny and Kelly Streck also did
cranberry looks on their Channel they
were super super beautiful so I'm
actually gonna link some videos and
reviews my palette down below if you
want to see more of that and you really
really really want to see cranberry all
over smokey eye both of them did that
load so I don't want to do it too and
it'd be like oh my gosh cranberry eye
galore so I wanted to add like a cup
crease and use a couple shades I didn't
use last time and add some more matte in
and show you guys how to use those also
I wanted to show our Pinterest because I
got inspired off Pinterest on this look
right here you see her I don't know who
she is
there's her name it is hae RI in D
underscore underscore so that's her
handle and she inspired my look today so
shout out to her beautiful look and I
kind of did my own little take on it
with my palette and oh my god I'm so
excited guys we're so close to launch
date we're like eight or nine days away
I don't know when this video is gonna
loo like or like eight or nine days away
which is getting really close and I'm
really excited so guys be sure and mark
your calendars and set your alarms for
10 a.m. PST time so excited but I'm
pumped I'm excited I'm ready for this
moment
I'm ready also edit winged liner today
and I know this is a random signed note
but I haven't done a winged liner on my
channel and like literally months it's
been forever I don't know why I
abandoned my winged liner but I just ran
into a gel liner that I love a lot so it
kind of got me wanting to do it again so
I talked about that gel liner in this
video again all the information Mountain
palette and the other product shoes on
my face are down in the description box
down below so don't forget to check that
out and I think that is my ninth hundred
announcements so we can go ahead and
jump into the video but first we gotta
sing a special song and we'll go ahead
and jump right into the video
okay so we're gonna get started I know a
lot of you guys came here to see the eye
look and we're gonna use none other than
my very own palette that created all by
myself
gasps pajamas so we're also gonna talk a
little bit more about the palette
because now that I put my video oh it's
like please God tell me there's nothing
in my teeth but just cuz I posted my
video on the palette and I got you know
a lot of more questions so I was able to
answer the question sometimes you don't
know all the questions you're gonna get
asked until you film video on it let's
go ahead and jump in and get started
first I'm gonna go in with the m-53
seven brush which is just a big fluffy
brush I like raspy bristles like this I
also have my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
already applied to my eyes and first I'm
gonna go in with my okey dokey which is
a matte shade and it is somewhat
transparent you can build it up but I
have it that way that way you can kind
of blend it all over and soften up your
eyeshadow primer and I choose this color
with a fluffy blending brush and I'm
just applying it all over which is gonna
help us blend everything else next I'm
just gonna go in with a little bit of
cry-cry actually I'm gonna mix cray cray
and bomb de da bomb diggity it cray cray
I'm also gonna be using an art 39 brush
from morphe so there we go we have the
colors mixed just applying this color
it's a very pigmented color as you guys
can see look how much pigment just came
off you're just applying it into the
crease as our transition shade we're
gonna have more of a pop with transition
today just totally fun buff it on out
too so I'm gonna do the exact same thing
over here just buffing out this
transition shade taking it up a little
bit high a lot of people ask me why I
named the pallet cat's pajamas and I'm
so sorry I didn't answer that that is
something I should I answered more so or
touch somewhere so in my original video
and it's kind of a southern thing it
kind of well it means something of
excellent it means if something's great
it's the cat's pajamas and people say
it's the cat's pajamas which doesn't
technically have to do with cats just
like the bee's knees it's just like a
kind of a southern saying of something
that's great or excellent and that's
what this palette is or else it wouldn't
do for sale right now so with that being
said that is why I named it the cat's
pajamas and I
really really I heard the name my
husband actually said the name and I was
literally like that is the eyeshadow
pallete name
that's name so if you can see I kind of
have this blown out a little bit more
than I normally do not quite pack down
as tight and now I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of I'm gonna actually mix
quirky and out the other
this is a purpley shade that is more of
a satin matte shimmer mixed hybrid color
and then this one is a shimmer and I mix
them together I'm gonna buff them in the
outer corner I'm gonna take at a 17
brush which is actually a smaller
blending Burson the r39 the one I was
just using and as I've told people out
the other here's me tapping in it if you
can see it has a little bit more kick up
so you don't want to go too heavy-handed
with this but I think I touched on that
in the original video already I'm just
going to push it right there I was gonna
put a brown in this palette I like a
dark brown but then I wanted to put
something with a little bit of spice to
it so I put out the other in after you
can see it's like a dark purple but yeah
as a brown undertone it has like a touch
of sparkle to it the sparkle is not
powerful it does not show up and do not
let it scare you out of using it it's
still a really pretty color and it
blends very easily and so I just wanted
to add like something that has a touch
of color in this palette really should
thanks up if that makes sense and you
can see there's a little bit of fall out
right here from out the other how the
other does have just a touch more fall
than the other colors I'm gonna go back
in with my clean blender and just soften
all this area
I'm gonna go back to my art 39 and grab
a touch of cookie which is our maroon
with a brown undertone shade I'm just
gonna flip the brush up and really try
to make this a little bit more cranberry
vibe going I'm gonna blend this more so
back and forth towards the top of the
eye taking it a little bit hot higher
and that way whenever I cut the crease
later it doesn't take off too much of
the shadow and then you can even go in
with this clean blender like I'm doing
which was the first person we used and
it is blend everything out make sure
everything's seamless and gradient that
there's no harsh lines going on also put
a touch of in one ear which is the
cranberry shade and let's start to blend
that in crease I'm gonna go in with a
little
more of the cranberry you guys really
requested for me to use the cranberry
shape and just cranberry it out a little
bit more our 39 brush pushing it into
the outer corner if you can see I'm
really really really softly moving it
forward now one of my favorite parts is
kinda Cree so I'm gonna take it this is
a Emma 4 to 5 it's a flat synthetic
brush which is what I recommend using
whenever you're cutting a crease I'm
gonna go back in with my Mac Paint Pot
in soft ochre getting a little bit on
both sides of the brush I'm just gonna
cut it out and you can apply this right
on top of your shadow and the Mac Paint
Pot does a really great job of coating
I'm gonna go in with some redonkulous
now I'm gonna take this is a Smith 302
brush it's a little bit of a smaller
synthetic flat brush and whenever you
use any of the shimmers in my palette I
recommend using a 2 pack on color not
dusting it on with any type of fluffy
blender like this it's just gonna
explode everywhere kind it and that kind
of goes for every shimmer so the colors
dry on my brush I'm going to show you it
dry I'll also show you it wet in case
you want to use it both ways but I'm
gonna pack on the color right here and
put it on top of my Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre so that is it dry all over my
eyes and we're gonna add a little bit
more I'm gonna wet it a little bit and
make it truly a more metallic shade with
the same brush I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of scatterbrain which is our
lighter gold shade it's super shimmery
and I'm going to apply this right in
front or kind of sorta on top mixing
redonkulous kind of like right in there
not taking it all the way in but kind of
mixing it right on in and with the same
brush I'm gonna take some quirky which
is a shimmery purple that we use just a
touch of earlier and I have it on my
brush I'm just gonna pack it on that
outer corner to like deepen that up a
little bit we're gonna apply a winged
liner today which I literally have not
done that like a mom
no like do I know how to do winged liner
still really no I'm just taking quirky
and I'm just popping it I'm kind of
patting it in that outer corner and then
I'm also gonna put it right there
wherever we get into redonkulous that
way there's no harsh line right there
I've cleaned off the same brush I'm
gonna go in with a little bit of okey
dokey which was the first color we use
and I'm gonna pack it on if you can
build it up but if you don't want it to
be white on your eye or this cream bone
shade on your eye it doesn't have to be
sometimes
I avoid using colors that are super
super super pigmented to soften up an
eyeshadow primer help to blend out a
look and so that was why it was very
important for me for okey dokey to be a
little bit of boat if you use it in many
ways it just depends on what tools
you're using and how you're applying it
this is a sigma lo4 it's like a tiny
little nugget brush it's so cute I'm
gonna take oddball which is our black
shade that's actually all throughout the
roots of my whole entire hair with me
trying to cover up my gray hair and I
use oddball every day I count on it
every day to help me out in that area so
I'm just gonna nudge this in the outer
corner and you don't want to go in with
too much black because as we discuss it
can really overtake your look and that's
why I'm using such a tiny precise brush
times I feel like if I whisper the
colors will fill my soft vibes I'm
giving it and they won't overpower my
lumps you can just talk to your makeup
you know your sleaze cut all right I'm
gonna take this pretty vulgar black gel
liner and this is a little liner brush
and we're gonna wing it out
so there's a winged liner I've really
been liking this gel liner and I like
pretty vulgar since lo liners they make
some good freakin liners so then I'm
gonna clean out this outer corner as
well because there's a little bit of
shadow down here when we were blending I
was gonna take a wipe ago and clean that
up and I do my other eye a winged liner
is done and if you can see it's just a
cut crease cranberry smoky with a little
bit of purple and gold and then a matte
we actually dipped into a matte color
this time and then a matte cut crease
kind of in there kind of a mix you could
actually take out the gold if you wanted
to and you just a cranberry smoky it
with a matte all the way through if you
didn't want the glitz and the glam I did
so now I'm gonna work on my face a
little bit and then I'm going to finish
the lower lash line first I'm gonna
start off with this Revlon Photoready
perfecting primer and I'm just gonna do
a pea-sized amount of it I'm gonna rub
it in between my fingers this really
warms it up and helps me to it
distribute the product I'm gonna apply
it in the areas where I pores annoy me
I'm gonna use my hourglass vanish
Foundation and this is in shade of beige
I always tell people they're like what
are you wish your foundation or what's
your favorite and I always resort to
this foundation a lot because it never
felt me it just always does me so right
I like to apply a lot of this product
and it's just the way I like to use it
and if you don't want to apply this much
I totally get that
I like my whole coverage I like a lot of
foundation I also like to spend a lot of
time cleaning it out with my last
expression morphe
I didn't mean greed this past weekend
and one of my subscribers Baja y6 works
from morphe in for me to sign and it may
be so happy I know you guys may think I
have a lot of moments and I forget
special things but there's just so many
moments that I'll never forget my whole
into our life and stuff like that like
means so much to me and like when people
wear my merch to my main crayons
it just it's just surreal but I feel
like surreal is a word that you so much
that it doesn't have that special touch
to it anymore it's like more than
surreal to me it's just like a moment
that I'll never forget and it's so
special once that is all ballooned out
by the way if you're wondering where
this is I burned myself with a curling
iron on my forehead getting ready for my
meeting great winced and I was like
great now we're gonna have
red bump on my head and now we have it's
turning brown now I'm gonna take my NARS
radiant creamy concealer this is what my
favorite concealers of all time and this
is in the shade custard this just does a
really good job of covering me where my
bags are heavy and baby girl they ain't
Chanel also doesn't crease so much on me
and really it lasts long I've probably
bought 50 of these in my lifetime
somebody's gonna take the same brush the
y6 it's really great for blending out
cream products it's a flat top kabuki
it's pretty simple brush to be honest
but it just does such a good job so I'm
gonna blend out this concealer and as
you can see the concealer - it just
blends out easy peasy lemon squeezy try
not to hit that winged liner I forbid
the concealer swipes across my wing and
ruins my day like this 8:49 brush I'm
gonna get the powder on here and I'm
just going a to packet on the under eye
and I like this brush because it has
that tapered shape on it so it's really
nice to get up in under eye area and
just put it also like your drag it down
my small lines because the small lines
like to play games with me throughout
the day and torture me and haunt me so I
just set them with powder which helps
tame the beast basically where you put
concealer you want to pack on a little
bit of powder always make sure and say
your concealer just please set it so
today I'm gonna be using the bronzer
from Estee Lauder X Victoria Beckham I
like this front to Allah I used to na
try it out video and it turns out that I
love it it's very smooth the gliding on
so I'm gonna use a little deeper one
called job a Sun and I'm gonna apply
this with a let me find my brush let me
find my brush okay this is an art 14
brush it's just a medium contour brush
not too big I also have powder on which
is okay because even at this brush bump
some of that powder it just blends it
into my skin so no reason to fret that
and I just allow that powder to set so
I'm just gonna blend that around the
temple area and just like swoop it all
the way around and hit the temples I
just got some of the black from my hair
into the bronzer brush brush and if you
can see I'm now gray cool I was like why
is this contour like so deep and like
cool toned all of a sudden I'm like oh I
get it I get what I did
cool that's cute just a day in the life
of larlie I want my own reality TV show
but I would have to be producers and
they wouldn't be able to manipulate the
show made me like
person I'm not because you know they
always do that TV show to get like their
ratings up I'm just gonna go ahead and
hit that jaw line with this wrong there
too without the block in it so I don't
have a five o'clock shadow like my
contour one of my favorite blushes
lately has been the flower beauty this
is there each promised blush
sucker from matte or shimmer or peach
blush there is a sucker for a peach
blush in general and this one is very
nice all their blushes are really nice
from flower beauty this is Drew
Barrymore's makeup line at Walmart oh it
has a peachy cheek HK so far highlight
I'm gonna go on with a little bit of
scatterbrain which is this Goldy color
right here I'm gonna just apply
scatterbrain and get like a touch of
golden highlights very blinding my
taking a little bit of scatterbrain on
my finger and just apply it on my nose
it's got a brain doubles as a cheek
highlight it doubles as a nose highway
and you can highlight the inner corner
and the brow bone with it as well it's
kind of a multi-use color in the palette
you know your girls got you covered on
that so I'm actually gonna pop just a
little bit of scatterbrain right here
can hit with the brow bone just a little
bit just a touch if you can see just a
tiny tiny touch alright let's finish the
lower lash line and add some lashes for
God's sake first I'm gonna mix together
these two shades bomb-diggity and cray
cray on this Mariah Carey it's like a
flat brush it's great it's a little bit
fluffy a little bit flat and it's great
for the lower lash line I'm literally
barely touching my skin you can see we
got pigment baby I'm gonna take a morphe
at three to six brush yeah I'm gonna
grab it of quirky and out the other
which is this shade I'm just gonna sweep
it from inner to outer corner but if you
can tell I'm taking it and I'm keeping
it a little bit closer to the lower lash
line that way the darker color is not
drag too far down which can make your
eye look a little bit droopy you can
take some black liner this one is not
working okay very good
these make it forever once more my work
I might need to warm it up I'm gonna try
to warm it up actually to get it going
make it forever ones are normally really
good so let's try it again here she goes
that a girl today for lashes reason Lila

course drama drama drama
