you guys enjoy the video alright
starting out with this makeup tutorial
I'm going to take my NYX Hydra church
primer this is a hydrating facial primer
and I'm gonna apply this all over my
face than my forehead and just let it
dry soak in then I'm going to take this
new all nighter foundation by Urban
Decay this one's in shade 7.0 which is
darker than my
home but it matches my arms and
shoulders this is the most full trying
to cover that zit girl we see you I'm
gonna blend it out my beauty blender but
as I was saying this is the most full
coverage foundation I think I've ever
put on my face in my life I like the way
it looks but it does take a lot of work
getting it blended out even because it
is so incredibly full coverage and heavy
just one you know the truth people so
next I'm going to take my Becca
concealer this is the first time I've
ever used this concealer and I liked it
so far it remind me a lot of the Born
This Way concealer by Too Faced but it's
a good one so far but I'm gonna keep
testing it out and I'll keep letting you
know my thoughts upon it but I'm just
gonna highlight my face and blend it out
with my Beauty Amanda I really love the
way the Beauty Blender makes the makeup
look on the skin and it also helps
whenever you're dealing with full
coverage make out I've been loving this
bassam the same I never know how to
pronounce it um this is a setting powder
and this one is a yellow tone one I will
have it linked down below I picked it up
at Sephora and I've been enjoying it it
was a little bit pricey for the amount
of powder you get because the little
package of it is timing then am i using
this studio makeup on the go palette I'm
taking this transition shade which is a
caramel color and an e 35 brush from
Sigma Beauty and I'm going to make that
trap my transition and just blend it all
in the crease to soften everything up
and help the flow of our makeup then I'm
going with a brand new makeup shadow
makeup shadow eyeshadow from makeup geek
called cabin-fever is a little bit of a
deeper Brown it's very warm I'm using
the exact same brush I'm going to blend
this on the outer corner blending it in
that outer V of the eye area then I'm
going to take another new shadow from
makeup geek this is called hype is
actually a foiled shadow and it's a
purple I wanted to add a pop of color
into this fall look so I'm going to
blend that with the e25 brush right onto
the outer corner just not taking it up
too too high then I'm just going to
smooth everything out then I'm going to
take this absolutely beautiful shade
it's called curtain call and it is a
foiled shadow from makeup geek as well
with the same brush I'm just going to
blend it and keeping it really low
that outer corner of the eye we're
focusing on the outer corner if you
can't tell I'm just going to take a
deeper matte brown color I normally
never apply a mount on top of a shimmer
like this but I'm doing it and it turned
out really beautiful and I just wanted
to deepen up the crease that way we have
a little bit of drama still using my
trusty e25 brush then I'm going to take
this little Lysias at e57 brush in the
shimmery shade just to pop it on the
brow bone and to highlight I'm going to
take the same brush and take the matte
light shame matte cream shade I'm going
to pack it on to the eyelid that way our
inner corner it kind of glows and I
actually so blend out the colors in the
center with my finger then I'm going to
take my Singh Sigma Wickett gel liner
I'm gonna wing it out I'm using the 810
brush from Sigma Beauty if you don't
like winged liner well then all you got
to do is draw a black line across your
upper lash line and leave it at that
as for me I love the drama you know I'm
going to wing it out then I'm going to
add mascara and lamp shifts my favorite
lashes are drunk in love by icon and I'm
going to apply them to my lashes to my
upper lashes I'm just going to put them
on my eye I'm gonna go back in with
cabin fever and an e 20 brush I lied to
you that's not an e 20 it's an e 32
brush and blend that from inner to outer
corner on the lower lash line then I'm
gonna take curtaincall with the e 20
brush it's called a short shader it's
really great for the lower lash lines by
Sigma and blend that right on top
curtain calls is that pretty Papa
cranberry then I'm going to take hikari
liner to define the eyes a little more
and apply that right into my waterline
next up I'm going to take my 9 C palette
from morphe and I'm going to contour a
little bit I'm going to be using the r14
rose gold brush to do this with is also
from morphe brushes I'm going to carve
out the cheekbones the forehead area the
jawline and a little bit down the nose
with an F 70 brush from Sigma this is
such a great contour palette because the
colors are very nice and cool toned and
they don't turn out really orange or way
too warm and look fakey i love it then
i'm going to go in with a 9 in palette
which is a blush palette mix those two
shades together that you see there and
it comes out with a shimmery but mommy
color and with an F
forty brush from Sigma it's just an
angled brush I'm going to pop that on to
the apples of my cheeks then I'm going
to take my favorite highlight at the
moment which is topaz by G way they're
having a 15% off discount code for you
guys I will put in the description box
and this fabulous fan brush from Sigma
and I'm going to apply that to the
cheekbones and get my glow on party
people I love to glow I hope you do too
anyways someone asked me our highlights
gonna be out for fall I think they are
going to be poppin then I'm gonna take
drop dead red from two phases my
favorite dark liquid lipstick and I'm
going to apply it to my lips and it
looks really beautiful I love the way
this look came out I hope you guys liked
it as well oh we can't forget our
setting spray I'm gonna set my face with
an all nighter setting spray from Urban
