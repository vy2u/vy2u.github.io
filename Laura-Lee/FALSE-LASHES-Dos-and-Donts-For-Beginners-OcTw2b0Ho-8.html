channel today's video is going to be a
how-to learning video and I haven't done
one of these in a long time but this is
very requested from you guys you guys
wanted to meet you guys wanted me to
show you how to do lashes so I figured I
would do a lashes do's and don'ts and I
started doing do's and don'ts videos a
long time ago on my channel and there
was so much fun I think I did I
definitely started with do's and don'ts
of eyeshadow in that video blew up and
went super viral and was a big growing
point for me on my channel and then I
did like juicing bolts of foundation and
so on and so forth so today we're gonna
be doing do's and don'ts of false lashes
so you guys have been asking the tips
and tricks on them and how to get it to
work and I know false lashes are booming
right now and so many people where I'm
compared to beforehand I think like when
I was in high school like that wasn't
hurt
well then heard of people just like the
beauty and she has just grown so much I
feel like people love them so much one
they did in the past if you are front
slash lover this video will help you I'm
gonna teach you how to put them on how
to make them comfortable how do I come
stand up and look flirty like you see
people on YouTube do I'm gonna teach you
all the tricks of salts lashes and do's
and don'ts so this would be a very
educational video and learning
experience and I feel like I'm really
good a person to speak on this because I
have made every single mistake there is
to make in flashes so you learn from
your mistakes and then you become a very
good teacher so that's kind of basically
my motto
and I definitely made a lot of mistakes
when I started wearing false lashes so
I'm here to teach you that too and in
today's video a partner would kiss
lashes they have really affordable easy
to apply lashes which could not be more
perfect for this video so thank you kids
for partnering with me you guys are
gonna love their lashes I'm gonna be
using while teaching you guys how to put
them on and kiss always makes the latest
and greatest technology in lashes so
they're perfect for this video and
that's one be using without further ado
I'm gonna sing my subscribe song and
then we're gonna jump right into the
video be sure and subscribe to my
channel
No yeah so and now let's go ahead and
jump right into the video
girl girl y'all see it all today look at
the skin oh yes ma'am oh you can see
what she didn't blend her foundation you
can see her bust it now the tea is hot
okay i'ma stop I'm gonna stop being
dramatic let's jump listen let's get
started right now as you guys can see I
don't have a lot of lashes and they
pointing downward because I'm a false
lash lover and so we're gonna be dealing
with this today and I'm gonna show you
guys how to make it work first step is
don't forget to curl your lashes if you
miss this step as you can see my lashes
are pointed downward and when the false
lash is flickering up you're gonna see a
disconnect so your first step is don't
not curl your lashes but do the first do
and don't so what I'm gonna do is just
take this little lash curler and give it
a squeeze I like to do do like a one two
three squeeze and that definitely gives
the lashes a good lift in that way not
only would they look better but they'll
also mix it with your faux lashes as
well
my next don't is a little bit difficult
to explain but I'm gonna do the best I
can so as far as adding mascara I like
to add a do is to add the mascara before
you put on the false lashes and you can
add a little bit more to help mix them
in but I wouldn't put false lashes then
don't would be to put false lashes right
on top of your other naked lashes and
then try to put on a bunch of mascara
cuz chances are you'll probably end up
uplifting your false lash as well as
getting it goopy and also it kind of
gets clumpy and ruin so called slash
where you can't use it again because
most folks ahsha's are usable I'll go
ahead and give my lashes a little bit of
mascara before I put them on today I'm
using the Dior this is the pump and
Volume one it's really nice and tacky
also if your mascara is soaking wet and
don't is do not just go plop the lash
glue and lash on top of it cuz then all
these will get really goopy I like to
apply the mascara then I'll work on my
lips or something else and then I'll go
ahead and go back and once the mascaras
dry and apply the false lash in today's
video I'm gonna be applying to different
lashes to this eye I'm gonna be applying
a more natural blowout lash and then to
the
I overhear all PI a triple push-up lash
by kiss and you guys can really see the
difference
the first lash I'm gonna be using is the
blowout lash and pompadour so this is
super wispy super flirty they're really
natural looking too so they're not too
heavy on the eye I really do like it
they have like a salon like blowout to
them that's why they're called blowout
this is what the lashes looked like I'd
only take a pair of tweezers and just
pull right from and in and just lift
that from the packaging really gently so
they don't rip I really recommend using
a tweezer to do that I don't wanna be
just going with your finger because a
lot of the time you can just bend it or
break it with your finger I next don't
is just please do not just apply these
straight to you I bow so if you can see
if I were to apply these straight to my
eyeball it would be a train wreck these
have to be trimmed
please trim your lashes trim your lashes
Jimmy lashes they are not made one size
fits all of our eyeball so different
size so you want to customize them to
your eye you want to grab your lash with
your tweezer and then what you can do is
put the inner corner where it needs to
rest and then you can kind of measure
how many sections need to be trimmed off
because your lash is not supposed to be
hanging off the edge like that don't is
do not trim from the shorter edge that
goes in the inner corner you always want
to trim from the outer edge if you trim
to the short edge you'll really lose the
shape and the prettiness of your lash
less is more so if you're not sure how
much to trim off trim off less than you
think and then re measure you can always
trim off more but you can't add more
lash on once you've already cut it off
so I always try not to get too crazy
actually no like I can literally look at
a lash nowadays like I know how much
neat cut off but that's cuz I wear them
everyday if you don't like be sure and
measure and go back and forth with your
measuring I'm gonna apply some lash glue
now and just find whatever lash glue you
like is best this strip lash glue
adhesive has biotin in it so I like to
use it is my kiss so I don't is I don't
recommend putting lash glue all the way
at the top of here but you do want to
apply the lash glue right there on the
van where it's gonna set on your skin so
that way it sticks really well and
you'll just add it aren't still I got a
little scratch right there but you'll
just add it all the way across a light
amount you don't another don't is don't
overdo with the lash glue
because you have a swimming-pool lash
glue on your eye and then it all just
goes downhill from there so adult is
applying the lash directly to the eye
right after the glue is put on you
definitely want to wait about five or
six seconds maybe air it around just a
little bit to let the glue become tacky
it's gonna make it way easier of a
process so do wait don't apply it
directly to your eye and if you can see
I just laid the inner corner on first
and then I just lightly laid the strip
as it went down just due to the shape of
my eye another don't you don't want to
apply your lash just straight on like
this like laying forward because then
whenever you look at someone you're not
gonna be able to tell you how false
lashes on want a flick of the lash up
and then you want to set it kind of go
in upward so you really would be able to
see the lash like I did over here not
straight out because that is just gonna
walk II so next what I like to do is
just give it a little pinch sometimes
people have tools that help them pinch I
don't mind using my fingers here I'm
pretty used to doing it just give it a
little pinch to make sure the real and
false lashes are connected now you have
your pellet slash attached to your
eyeball what I like to do now is go in
with a little bit of mascara and just
connect them even better you don't have
to do this step honestly but I like to
do it so I'm gonna add it in these
lashes are super lightweight apply very
level and it's kind of a blowout for
your lashes and they curl up so they're
very flattering next up we're gonna do
this eye with a more fuller lashes I'm
gonna show you how to put on the lash
with a little bit of a thicker band so
today we're gonna be using the triple
push-up collection this one it is course
set it's really pretty this has a triple
lash pattern in it which also enhances
the volume defines the link it has an
eye at lifting curl so I'll remove the
lashes the exact same way with a pair of
tweezers so I'll do the same thing I
will measure them but do you see that
little tab at the front of this end you
want to cut that off even though that is
the inner corner piece or else that's
going to poke you and feel a bit
uncomfortable so I guess the don't there
would definitely be two don't leave that
on and go ahead and trim from that outer
edge another don't you don't want to
apply the lash just like OH
on that I without curving it because
it's gonna flick her up in that inner
corner right there you always want to
take your false lash and give it a
little bin kind of like that being
gentle with it so it's curved and that
way it'll fit on your eyes so much more
easy without that inner corner pop it up
I went ahead and add it glue to the edge
which we talked about before and sit at
the top we added it right there on the
inner edge if you can see this latch is
definitely thicker so sometimes with
these it's easier or with any lash it's
easier to apply with tweezers to show
your fingers so I'm gonna apply these
with tweezers and what you don't want to
do is look or close your eye and have
one eye open squinting like this because
you're really gonna have a hard time
applying it you also don't want to be
looking straight up like this at the
mirror it's gonna be impossible you
always want to be just kind of looking
at downwards have a mirror right here
I'm just kind of looking at and downward
at it and then again I'm gonna place the
lash lifting it upward not just straight
on like this so you can get that full
potential glam out of the lash I'm gonna
set it on and just enhance the
attachment on to the outer corner in the
inner corner with the tweezers and as
you can see the lashes really flickering
up because I flicked it up and set it
down on up my lashes so again I'll do
the exact same thing you don't want to
just set it and leave it there you do
want to go ahead and give it a little
pinch that way it does attach to your
real lashes also with these lashes if
you're applying them on a client you
want to apply them not having the client
close or I you want the client just to
look down and then just apply them and
then you want to ask the client is
anything poking you are you
uncomfortable and if they say no you've
done great if they say yes you might
have to adjust tip and you don't want to
ask your client does the lash feel weird
because let's be real you put a false
lash your eye it feels a little weird
which is normal so this gives a dramatic
high-impact effect it has dimensional
lift and the lash band definitely even
though it is thicker than this lash band
it still blends with the lash line
seamlessly again I'll do the same thing
because if you can see these lashes
they're already trying to get a little
crazy right here so you don't just want
to leave that you do want to go ahead
and grab your mascara and just give it
like one or two little little pump the
mascara for one more little tip if your
eye is watering really bad in the inner
corner and that lash just keeps flicking
up
dilash off give it a minute do a few
deep breaths through your nose and it
helps to pull the sinuses back and it
kind of helps with the watering it's not
a miracle work it's not gonna completely
stop your eye from water but it does
help to pull the water back in the eye
instead of constant dabbing so you wanna
remove the lash give a few deep breaths
even if you're doing makeup on a client
tell them take a few deep breaths
through your nose cool it down let's
comment down because the sticky icky
gooey situation with the wet eye and the
glue it just doesn't get better until
like the glue is done it's out of the
eye the eye can have a second to rest
and then you just start fresh and also a
little tip girl if I have on false
lashes and I'm going out honey every
single time I have a little lash glue in
my purse I don't care where I'm going or
for how long I'm being there I've also
run predictable we don't know what's
gonna happen you could literally rub
your eye too hard and lift your own lash
off you could have a watery eye that now
you don't know what's gonna happen and
how you gonna go out the rest of the
night with your eyelash flicked on up
girl and also sometimes my friends
lashes may be lifted and I got a tail go
you got a wonky lash meanie you know I'm
talking you so you're wearing false
lashes I should recommend carrying lash
glue with you if you are unset in a
professional setting you want to carry
lash glue that is latex free which this
one is because some clients might be
allergic to it so so I hope this video
was helpful to you guys my personal
favorite is the thicker you guys know
I'm a glam girl you know I like that
thick lash these I literally cannot even
feel on my eye I could wear these lashes
every single day and I can sleep in them
although I'm not recommending you do I
can't pull on my eye so they're also
available on ulties calm as well as in
stores at Ulta and if you want to check
