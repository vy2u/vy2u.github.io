work out really well I am filming with
nothing but the beautiful lighting I'll
share with the end of the video what my
outlook is I can't even think today I'm
so crazy hey guys what's up and welcome
to my channel today's video is going to
be on Finn T Beauty oh my god I hope you
guys are so excited to see this review
I've gotten so many questions if I was
gonna review it and my thoughts on it so
I went to the event last night and I got
the product and I am in New York for a
while so I figured I would fill mom here
up this week is also Fashion Week
I have lots of events to attend so I'm
gonna be in Newark for homonym Here I am
here's my hotel room we're doing
old-school YouTube video I brought my
selling camera we don't even got a fancy
canon no fancy lenses no fancy backdrop
like this is me chillin I'm a little
t-shirt you know where you start on this
review but before we get started you
know we're gonna sing a fancy little
song be yelling I will go ahead and jump
right in the video let's jump right in
the video I actually just recently got
up to check the sound on my intro and
hit my ankle on the table and now it is
bleeding profusely okay starting out I'm
gonna try out the new fin t Beauty
official primer so when we Rihanna is
called pro filter soft matte primer by
the way and while rihanna was speaking
they were speaking about Rihanna excuse
me at the event they were saying that
she was really adamant about creating
the facial products first or since I
should palettes and lipsticks and color
things she more so wanted to do they
faced up I'm gonna go ahead and apply
this it feels very low SHINee yeah it
doesn't feel what smells good too it
doesn't feel like um that silicone fill
so it feels really soft and lotion II
will see how it wears does I got the
foundation to and is the affinity of
beauty foundation looks like this it has
like the soft touch bottle with like a
white
lissa shake well on it and this is the
pro filter soft matte foundation I did
color test myself at the event it was
honestly very chaotic to do this magic
Bank in a room with my 50 girls all
trying to color match themselves and
grabbing foundations everywhere I was
like holy I don't even know what to
do right now but me and a stranger a
girl she was so beautiful we looked at
each other we're like we're like the
same skin tone so we got together meet
her like went around the table we're
like hmm I was like that's two more
trees so it'll be too much for me I
don't know dude we like went around and
we both found the shape 300 which is the
shade that I'm using today 300 that's
what we went with so that was the
craziest experience ever trying to find
my foundation with that being said I got
a foundation brush with it this is the
110 foundation brush this looks very
weird to me for a foundation brush
personally I wouldn't typically use
something like this as a foundation
brush I've no viewfinder by the way so
whew
but you know what it seems to be
applying the foundation nicely so I'm
kind of liking the brush so this
foundation just let you know like even
on my hand the dry time is it's fast
with it
like once you put it on you better start
moving the foundation because it will
stick down to your skin but with that
being said it does stick down to your
skin which is nice because it had like
that long wearing really luxurious feel
to it cuz I kind of was like playing
with it a lot at the event but now my
hand you know seeing how it felt and
then on my hand I did dry down very
matte so we'll see how that wears today
and we will be doing check-ins in this
video so make sure and steaks on the end
of the video so you guys can see like
how the foundation wore it was looking
like it's got really nice coverage to it
too because you know this girl right
here likes her coverage the foundation I
like the price of it I believe it's $39
so with that being said like kendo it's
owned by kendo this line isn't done by
can no Sun by Rihanna but
can know and can do owns like a Bondi
they all Marc Jacobs they own a lot of
Sephora brands kendo makes nice
luxurious products so I have high
expectations for this I go ahead and
drag it on the neck because my face is a
lot lighter than my body so I typically
get my foundation to match my neck area
as well so that way whenever I drag it
down everything's flowing nicely it
looks so pretty on my skin it's
definitely not as full coverage I
thought it would be it definitely has a
lot of pigment to it but you can see all
my freshly and dark circles through it
so that is one layer of the foundation I
think I'm just gonna add just a little
bit more to build it up to see if we can
get a little more coverage it's
buildable seems to be building pretty
nicely with men I will sing Rihanna this
Chlamydia should've seen Rihanna song
leaked throughout trying it out it's
evenly applied and I think my skin looks
like beautiful velvet I'm gonna declare
this kind of like more of a medium
definitely not full coverage foundation
I just still see a lot through the
foundation so I'm gonna say more so look
at my hair I'm gonna say medium coverage
on this I tried to build it up a little
bit and I did it was buildable but
nothing crazy let's see how it wears
throughout the day next we're gonna try
out her contour highlight and concealer
stick quick check in I've had on the
foundation for about three hours now and
I think it still looks pretty good
little shiny right here nothing major
pretty normal for me still looking good
I went ahead and popped on some eyebrows
since there's no brow products have you
figured that wouldn't hurt and a little
bit of eyeshadow um because there's no
my show either and mostly we're testing
out face makeup I love it the foundation
like right off the bat I don't see any
bad things about it I will say the
shades were pretty darn warm toned so be
careful you might want to go in store
and get tested matched so you don't
wander the wrong track now let's test
out the cream product so they magnetic
together they look like
honeycomb they are let's just address it
because I know I've read so many
comments it's Kim K it looks like Kim K
that has to be a coincidence that the
mat I'm soft pink because the way
manufacturing and makeup works there's
no way we on it would be able to copy
her line it sucks it is a coincidence
um but just like timing and makeup
there's no way there's no way this stuff
has probably been in production for a
year ago so you know the nude pink is
like really in right now and if you can
see they actually are quite different
shades nude pink so just want to throw
that out there I like that they magnet
together but I will tell you like the
line connects together like the chances
of powder okay not this is a brush and
the translucent powder but I will tell
you that's not a selling point for me
like that's not something that makes me
go oh now I'm for sure gonna buy the
brush because it magnetics because I
probably won't personally use that and
that is just my personal opinion and
letting you guys know that how the
concealer shade this is French vanilla
it looks like this it's very yellow tone
I have a yellow undertone so you're
supposed to be able to conceal with this
seems really rich and creamy just first
impressions trying this venti out yes
Finn tea hopefully it'll have some
courage sometimes highlighting sticks
don't so much hop coverage and then we
have the sponge which I've already
dampened so it is a little bit bigger
has a flat edge and then it's round egg
shape and then a little flat edge at the
top a little fuzzy on it give it some
character very squishy actually feels
just a squishy if not squishier than the
Beauty Blender sieve Rihanna's coming
for the Beauty Blender and I'm gonna
blend this out it seems like the product
might be a little bit big to bug out
with a sponge but it is blending just
gonna take a little bit extra time again
the sponge is dampened oh it looks
pretty um I need just like a touch more
coverage right here if you guys can see
the darkness I need a touch more
coverage but nothing to cry about
rich vanilla the shade I'm using is very
yellow tones of your pinky undertone
this may not work for you they have
multiple shades though to choose from so
do not do not worry
well maybe you can see like this sponge
is so soft it just like malicious into
the skin so I do I'm gonna go ahead and
say I love the sponge just so this
makeup look is complete I kind of want
to add just like a tiny touch of my
heart-shaped cake I'm gonna go to an
event to tonight a little bit more I do
like the highlight stick though that did
blend out nice and it looks really
pretty if you have super dark circles
don't lean on it to cover your dark
circles next let's do the contour stick
I got the shape I got the shade mocha
which is a little bit more of a warmer
tone Brown again she has multiple shapes
in these and they do connect super cool
mani I know got a shade that was a
really cool tone and I put it on me and
it sure turned me gray like crazy gray
so I was like seeing can't use the same
shade as you bb it has a bit of product
and I will say this is a fat thick stick
and it has so much pigment in it I think
that will last you a long time what do
you guys think about that sound off in
the comments section down below see the
product is kind of thick you gotta do a
little bit of work
it does feel luxurious though like the
product just feels foxy it's gonna take
a minute to I'm thinking a brush on this
side of my face cuz this is just like
kind of hard to blend out this fun this
is feels like such a thick rich product
I feel like this sponge is drinking up
the product or something weirds going on
so I'm gonna use a brush I'm actually
gonna use my white sacrum or peat just
because this brush is quite dense so it
moves cream product really well feel
like that was way easier so any kabuki
you got on deck will work well I'm still
gonna add just a little bit more just
like a sponge to it that way I'm all
crema pie that's a weird way of putting
that and I do have quite a few of the
highlights which again they stick
together so we're gonna swatch a few I'm
gonna use the purple and then I'll use
the Starlight one as well and then we'll
put some heart
or ones on top so we can test this out -
first I think we should do unicorn which
is one that's caught a lot of attention
and let's go ahead and swatch it on the
hand again it's like the same amount you
get as the contour so you would be using
this as a highlight for days unless you
bathe your whole body and in which I
might do and they blend out kind of
powdery like very soft and natural so
this is the lavender again I have no
powder on my face whatsoever I only have
green products so they should blend out
pretty nicely where you know that out I
think it's pretty I think it's really
pretty at my skin and actually once I
get it blended out I do I get insulate
this one just picking up a lot of the
product but once I get it picked blended
out I feel like it looks less lavender
and more just like a light shimmery
highlight I don't know if you guys can
tell that the highlights like purple
until you swatch it and then it turns to
a lighter color so it's more of a
wearable purple color which is nice so
let's go ahead and swatch confetti and
chili mango I like that name a lot chili
Mingo do they make it oh that dress is
we're gonna put confetti on top I can't
help it I got to do this I got to do
this guy's okay so I'm here for confetti
more so than unicorn it's so much more
of a pop and then let's try chili mango
this is going to look like
ravishing on a darker skin tone it's
gonna give you that warm beautiful
golden era desn't glow oh my god you
have a deeper skin tone girl gets you a
chili mango again they're blending out
um kind of cream and then they kind of
blend out into a powdery form which I
like a lot now let's try out some of the
powder highlights the packaging is white
it has like a purple duochrome tone to
it it is the honeycomb shaped I think
the packaging was beautiful and
luxurious I'm not gonna lie whatever
they were like doing the home omit would
like the dates like on support
everything was like black and graffiti
kind of like the box by the way here
the box to the primer and then whenever
it came out everything was a soft and
pink and to me that was very confusing I
thought was gonna be like dark and edgy
and then it is all that softened pretty
you're not gonna be able to wear all
highlights cuz she's got a ton of woman
I'm only out one phase I know every
super excited about trophy wife this is
the only highlight that doesn't have two
shades in it and the rest have to we
have lighting dust and crystal fire
lighting destra so fire chic preak and
girl-next-door groan that store sheep
creek mean money and hustla baby so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna try to
truck your wife right now I want to try
it with her highlight brush it looks
like this has a stoop in it so it fits
perfectly on that cheekbone which I
think it's really cool I'm excited about
it it's number 120 she's gonna get some
on the brush we were smashing these last
night there's a hair at the event and we
were all like a little we're all
shaking the brush is nice guys I like
this brush oh I feel like trophy wife
Breanna was actually wearing this to you
last night so that's exciting she was
wearing last night it looked beautiful
on her skin tone I think it was
beautiful my skin tone it's really cool
and Jeffery was putting out on his skin
tone last night they had a tripod
station so beautiful so the really cool
thing about trophy wife I truly believe
this one look good on all skin tone so
kind of like a great color pool but yeah
Universal highlighter I'm gonna try out
this one that I'm really excited about
this is hustler baby it looks like she
has more of a subtly highlight and then
a bling-bling one you like the way I'm
saying that on top of this one yeah it's
stunning
these are very very pigmented Brianna
Kings pigmentation baby okay let's watch
the other ones is when I just watch this
crystal fire and lightning dust is a
more subtle crystal fire lightning dust
here is the pink one girl-next-door chic
freak so here is chic freak and then
right there is girl next door right
there
and then we're gonna try the one I have
on my face hustla baby and mean money or
a more subtle one so right here we have
mean money and then hustla baby right
there which is again the one I have on
my face and they all have a nice mirror
in the compact and they click close last
highlight we have a pool metal moon
highlight and this one I swash to the
event it's very subtle
this one is more so subtle it's this
right here on my hand it's uh just like
a touch it doesn't on your skin so if
you're not into a huge glowing light
boom highlight on your face you might
like metal moon as from me I don't
really see myself using this how op them
and just because it puts like this
subtle aired essence on your face
there's just like an end for me kind of
product that I won't use that much X
we're gonna try out the chances at
powder now this one comes you know what
I should have blend it out I forgot we
had brushes cool great job Laura you're
a failure at your job this is the one
that actually comes with a contour and
this thing like raises up and you get it
to like buff out the contour so you know
what we're gonna do try to buff out some
contour so we're gonna take mocha I feel
like I could still use some more contour
this is the fin taya Beauty at contour
and concealer brush I don't hate this
brush I feel like it just took all the
product off my face again why do I feel
it okay um it's pretty and yeah I don't
hate the brush I feel like the brush
will be really good for the nose contour
as well because it's smaller um you know
what this just be honest this is not a
go-to brush for me I do feel like a DOS
drink some of the product but it
definitely gets the job done blending
out so he needed a contour brush
I don't know if I recommend this
actually so dense and hard okay it picks
up so much of the product that it wasted
a little bit but it also blends it out
so it's not the worst thing I'm not
gonna complain about it like it's
terrible don't get it but it's not my
favorite and then we have the brush
right here it's so tiny and that's
already a red flag for me to plot apply
the chances of powder and I like six of
the pan and I showed you guys before so
here's the translucent powder I'm behind
the camera being creepy now it's just
making sure we're all in focus it's just
a clear translucent guy has really
interesting packaging chances and how I
can't with this sponge in it as well and
I'm just I'm just not here for little
things like this you guys already know
I'm just like I feel like the trans is a
power like this could just not be in it
and it would be okay so this isn't I
think more so for like the moment you're
on the go ain't can you scoop some up
well yes somewhere the concealer is too
under the brush is nice for me to get in
like little baby detail spots like if I
want to just be like oh right here you
know what I mean like tap tap tap and
don't want powder exploding especially
if I'm like out and public and I just
need like I got a greasy in my forehead
and just need a baby touch-up because of
the size of the brush I feel like it's
nice for that however whenever I'm at
home applying translucent powder or a
powder to my face I typically will just
hit the whole face with it with a big ol
brush just like the brush would be a
little bit too small for me on an
everyday use but she's obviously planned
it for a girl on the go and like it
clicking on to the compound and matches
the compact so it's really pretty in
sleek looking so I like it for that so
you could just touch up the areas
they're getting a little old and you
need that touch up by the way I have
starstruck highlighter I really like
this cream one too I gotta try it out
the event and I think that this one's
the most neutral one of all of them it's
pretty it's just like a white champagne
color and again it blends out powdery
but this one I would say it would be the
easiest like most simple initial
we're just look at everyday highlight so
next we have the 50 beauty gloss mom to
try out come out with one lip product
and this is it it's a very neutral one
but it's very pretty
it also has the honeycomb shape and if
you guys can see like it's very pretty
like tastes and smells really luxurious
and good feel like there's nothing
special about it like I feel like it's
just lip gloss so it's just a pretty
little gloss like you don't feel like
it's like oh you know it's got Rihanna's
name behind it so if you feel special
about that but reality of it it's just
lip gloss it's just almost almost a
clear lip gloss with like a touch of a
pink heel and that's it I also got the
blotting paper by Finn - beauty is this
little roll a blotting paper that you
kind of set up yourself and here it
opens and then you have to like take
this out and then you put it in and then
you run it through and then you close
this and they close that and then you
pull it it's got a mirror it's honeycomb
shape okay what that you take your
blotting paper and you can apply I think
this is a cute I did daughters and why
it doesn't want to work for me
and now it's I'm not gonna recommend
this to you guys I prefer like the drug
feel a little once you just pop out and
that's just like a really fancy version
my favorite highlight is hustla baby and
trophy wife and then I would say my one
that I would probably use the lease the
Chic freak and girl next door because of
its pink color I might would use that as
an eyeshadow instead rather than you
know not so much a highlight but the
crystal fire and lightning dust is also
very neutral I wear a lot but this one
is probably the one I would wear the
leaves just going over everything the
highlight sticks are really really
beautiful I love them this I would put a
concealer under like
to do this over again with a concealer I
put concealer and then put this on top
of it to give it a little extra oomph
and highlight they blend out nice it is
ain't got enough covering power for me
the contour stick was really really
really beautiful and the sponge is great
I definitely recommend this to things
for you we're gonna do a wear test and
on my iPhone mom outlet oh it's just
like snatched it together while I'm out
and about today I'll finish off the
foundation review for you guys but I
thank you guys so much being here and
watching everything as far as me
checking right now the day after the
event is still were still nothing's sold
out that I saw truly the line is
beautiful and Rihanna I think you killed
it girl I think you did an amazing job
and I love that you focused on you know
different stuff
um I let the packaging to it's very
luxurious very well put together and I'm
excited for the line so I approved the
line I think it's great you know of
course couple hits a miss but overall
for like a whole line coming out and to
have so many hits that's amazing and the
price point of the foundation is great
we're just gonna see how it works out
the day but like my skin looks so pretty
right now I'm happy with it right now
and also I do love the brushes so I've
rambled on enough thank you so much for
being here and watching be sure oh yeah
totally I'm uh put on some lashes and go
run some errands out here in New York
City and live the city life you worked
really not for me but I can I can do
like a week here and I'm like hole I'm
