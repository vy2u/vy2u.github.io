video is going to be a try it out
Phineas who's excited I am today I'm
going to be trying out a lot of products
including the new Chloe Bible palette
oxide hito Smashbox today and I'm going
to be trying out the it Smashbox would
be legendary liquid metals I have on
metal pedal pedal metal right now this
is my favorite one of them all oh my
gosh I'm so obsessed I have a total of
seventeen colors between E liquid metals
and liquid pigments these three of my
favorite colors first we have metal pail
which is the one that I'm wearing now is
just so pretty
we have a mob squad which is a good
dusty rose it has that metallic sheen
behind it and then we have a really cool
pop of color called iced out which is of
course the metallic blue which you've
probably seen all over Instagram I've
seen this blue color floating around and
it is just like yes honey I'm in the
room loved it so much they have a soft
cushion gel formula so it feels really
nice and easy to wear it's not too
sticky or goopy the light reflects on
them as you can see and it gives you the
appearance a fuller look they have tons
of colors to choose from these are just
fabulous and they've really gotten me
into wearing the metallic lips I mean
now I'm kind of loving the blue color
shows wear this for the rest the video I
don't know I think I will we're going to
go ahead and jump right in the video and
get started I hope you guys are excited
to see what look I came up with and well
this little if I came up with so I guess
you already know anyway probably you
guys are excited to see a bunch of these
first impression you guys should watch
subscribe to my channel for you leave
and we're going to go ahead and jump
right in and get started oh no one
that's funny
alright guys Park I'm going to go in
with a little bit of this Smashbox
primers to prep the skin before we get
started into the purse impressions this
is the photo finish primer so what I
like to do is just rub a pea-sized
amount right in this area get the smile
lines and a little bit on the forehead
right there done it makes my hand so
it's salted I can't snap okay the first
product we're to be testing out is the
Neutrogena hydro boost this is their new
foundation system moisturize and plump
and skin for 24 hours has hyaluronic
acid in it you're going to do carmel
this is shade
105 see what it's all about oh it's got
the doe foot okay
oh that's not my color okay girl
alright so cool we're going to do
natural beige or yeah natural beige
though what this is yeah they got me you
know I got played I got played on camera
happen to the best so less I'll just say
it together what brush I'm going to use
to you Wow looks everything you guys
give to yourself good good I bet someone
who's never watched my videos before
like what is she talking about
so just applying at this foundation it
kind of feels like nothing if that's a
weird way to put it like I don't really
see that much coverage it doesn't look
bad on my skin and honestly lately I've
been showing off my skin more more girl
it's summertime you know saying this
color does look a wee bit ashy on me you
know what there's not much to it
but it looks kind of glowy and pretty
and it feels wet on the skin it does
soaking wet and sticky I think it's
pretty but it's definitely not for a
full coverage girls out there it does
have a little luminosity to which I do
like and you can see the darkness and
rustling right through it so it kind of
gives you an idea that it is a more
sheer product so things like a pretty
simple foundation if I had to describe
it I mean not much to it but if you have
dry skin this could be great it feels
good on my dry skin and my skin doesn't
look patchy or anything or weird so
that's good so we'll move right along
and I'm testing out a new almost dropped
it a new concealer today I don't know if
it's new but I've never tried it out and
you guys asked me to try out beach
cosmetics all the time so I figured I
would do it for you because I love you
so much
this is the pro to be a proto coverage
concealer I'm going to be testing out
shade 1:04 and it comes with this little
applicator I'm not gonna lie I was
watching it yesterday it's so thick um
because I was real interested in it and
I was trying to get like parts together
for this video a little bit goes a long
way
alright I think this woman do because I
don't want to get too cray cray I'm
going to take a G at 35 brush and just
tapping it this out it fills like it's
blending out with how easiest lending
out but you look at that coverage yo oh
that's really pretty okay I like the
concealer I mean do we still like
darkness is coming through I don't know
let me finish the look and make
executive decisions but it's like
blending out so easy for as heavy and
like thick as it is we'll see what
happens we'll get the tea on it actually
like love this concealer right this
second
it looks pretty what now I'm just going
to grab a little bit of my cover FX
setting powder and go ahead and set this
lightly instead of baking because I just
like rub it in honestly I feel like
baking and just takes all the luminosity
out of the skin so I'm just like rubbing
in and so it doesn't like run and it
sets it still but it's not like
overpowering more like a soft setting
situation here okay moving right along I
got the radiant bronze light in a PR
package from hourglass look how pretty
this is
I haven't washed it yet Oh so it kind of
turns out different please watch it do
you see that like how it changes
completely whenever you swatch it oh my
god I almost dropped it guys I'm so
clumsy
you guys are like no crap I know Laura
but just know I'm clumsy okay when I
take it our fourteen brush okay to look
at this the product came back to life
whenever I tapped it something strange I
don't know what's going to happen I'm
never I don't think I've ever used one
of their bronzers before apparently it's
got a oh it's it's existed okay I kind
of thought it was sheer because a lot of
the hourglass highlights and all that
moment is very sheer it's not shared all
the bronzer is like lots of pigment so I
would tap off the brush whoa whoa Nelly
now we know - this is the first
impressions video that really does a
warm up the face nicely and it kind of
gets like a soft natural moment there
what do you guys think
I loves it it looks really pretty I
wouldn't have thought I would have got
this much pigment out of it but hey here
we are
okay next for blush I'm going to be
using the also got a blush in from the
era Desmet Electra this is what she
looks like so I'm kind of a sucker for
anything peachy I'm going to take a
white four brush and just pop some of
this on I'm assuming does this one is
just as pigmented oh yeah that's pretty
do you see like this subtle peach Ness
and I also has a little bit of a sheen
to it so it does have some shimmery
moments in it so if you do have enlarged
pores in this area I probably wouldn't
recommend this to you because it might
enhance the pores with the sheen or you
could just use like a really good primer
it might work out but you have to be
careful with blushes like a lot of
shimmer if you have enlarged pores
because sometimes not all the time but
sometimes it can enhance those boards
and grow we have not long that it gives
you a little peach sparkle very soft
like this make it look so pretty and
like a little natural moment it's not
natural but it looks so know how to
describe it okay next I know you guys
are really excited about me trying this
out this is Carli bybel second collab
with BH and this is the deluxe palette
this is what it looks like I'm going to
go ahead and use the highlighter shade
and swatch a few for you and I'm also
going to be doing the eyes with this
palette today so you can also use the
highlighter shades as an eye shadow too
so kind of a bonus and I've already
swatched these because I got really
excited I mean I feel so creamy they
almost so wet they're so creamy I really
like these I'm going to mix these two
together for my cheekbones and it is
stunning love's it honey loves it yes
darling hold it back love little in the
forehead
little bit down the now uh-huh oh my
goodness that is just pretty you cannot
deny it my goodness okay let's move on
and do the eyes I'm going to go ahead
and put my brows on and my eye primer so
we can just roll longer the video let's
keep it moving people
and we have eyebrows so I'm going to use
this palette like I said I'm going to
first go in with this light tan color
the overall palette is pretty neutral is
similar to her
she's definitely added some colors this
pink is really standing out to me so I
want to play with it real laughs it's a
pretty palette I will say I bought her
first one and I loved it so much so here
I am with the second one this is a five
at seventh where you add girl
perhaps there this is a five seven three
brush from morphe and I'm just going to
go in with this great little piece of
shade too like it's kind of
transitioning but it's also like that
nice shade that like Hill she went out
that primer let me tell you something if
I wash my brushes to night I don't know
what I'm gonna do I don't know where I
was going with that but they're so dirty
that I'm embarrassed by them and I'm
always really good about my wash my
brushes like I normally will do it every
eight days or so because I do full beat
makeup unless every day so it requires
it like a little over a week I'll go
ahead and take care of that but girl
they are dark to add and had time to
take poo so honey do this okay I'm going
to take this shade right here
now if I'm judging this palette I will
say this shadows still the exact same as
in her last palette I feel nice they
have a lot of pigment to them as you can
see I'm blinging out you can kind of get
an idea on how they blend it's really
nice
also this blending brushes bomb-diggity
I love the H because of the price point
and I know Carly is a girl who I she's
BH since she started her channel so I
think it's really cool to see her collab
with them now I feel like I'm gonna dab
in this little purple matte shade right
here a little bit it's so pretty and I'm
gonna like I really want to just just
this on the outer corner if you notice I
will just kind of I'm still using the
same shadow brush by the way I'm just
doing small motions like purple is
pretty next I'm going to grab a little
bit of the pink color that is so cool
it's like an era dicent pink where it
has like a little bit of gold to it if
you can see
I'm going to go back in with a little
bit of that purple shade we were using
and I'm just going to add to the outer
corner just a little bit I am going to
take my NYC a liner and just do a little
small line on the lash line because I am
going to add false lashes and I don't
want you to be able to see a gap so this
kind of fills it in just a 10 and little
black line honey just a ton alone what i
manju next is that mixed together the
purple and brown shades and stepped it
on the lower lash line the quality
reminds me a lot of the last palette I'm
going to add a little bit of my Big Shot
mascara of course to the upper and lower
lashes look why me and last but
certainly not least I'm going to add my
Smashbox lippy in metal petal this is my
favorite one they came out with and I'm
kind of been wearing it non-stop it
looks so pretty on the lips now you guys
have probably noticed I'm almost um it's
Ralad and about to have to get some
lunch as you guys have probably noticed
I don't wear mattelli lips a lot and
this has gotten me into the metallic lip
thing it is just so pretty on the lips
and the way the light is it makes your
lips look so much fuller I adore this
product and I really like how soft and
comfortable it is it is until 2 goopy I
can't do a lip gloss is like goopy and
you're about to see like how much
pigment the tabs in it you do one swipe
go you done it's so easy look at that
I hope so pretty mmm-hmm
go this is my jam right here I'm going
to wash and lastly I'm just going to set
my makeup with this touchable English
alright guys and this is the final look
this is my first impressions video where
there's nothing I didn't like I've never
had that happen before yeah so today was
a good day with makeup
