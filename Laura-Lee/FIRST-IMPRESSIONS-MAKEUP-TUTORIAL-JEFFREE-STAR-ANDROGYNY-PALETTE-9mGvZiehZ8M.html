thank you so much for being here you
guys are the best you're awesome blossom
i love you girl okay so I think that's
all my blabber and I got for you where
to go ahead and jump right in and get
started okay first I'm going to start
off with a la girl pro coverage sister
HD I'm with a concealer this is a HD
primer which I've never tried out before
we got to get her going this is primer
or paint what long wearing foundation oh
my god this is the foundation Lightner
and I thought it was a primer because I
don't know how to read who I was with
self so quickly almost wiped paint all
over my face hi this video is not
starting out that great so let me try
this again I'm just going to go in with
some of this course Greek yogurt this is
like a primer in a moisturizer X we'll
move on to the actual foundation hi
hello Laura
I might actually mean Dec 7th tested
these color so just be actual pro by la
girl foundation under this is only ten
dollars I've never tried it out I've
heard good things about it so we're
going to test it out and see my thoughts
I'm going to try to shade for for
natural first I was like a pretty shade
it feels like not too too liquidy a
little bit rich oh I'm gonna take my
morphe white seven brush its most you
know this is like this one is like it it
matches so stick a little pink this
isn't one of my favorite foundation
brush
I love the gilded collection from morphe
really great brushes start impressions
on this it's still really nice on the
skin um definitely have some coverage to
it so you can barely see my freckles so
that means it's always just the covering
you know I don't know how it's going to
wear but as far as the first application
I can't believe I just got that coverage
just like a high-end really high-end
product I'm very happy with the outcome
it's a little bit shiny right now I'm
going to be sure it's going to dry down
the next product I have to try out is a
drugstore product 250 precise perfecting
highlighter and it is meant for the brow
bone area
yeah it's called brow precise so because
if I got a weird top on it I'm just
going to smudge you some off on my hand
like this and then take a brush I'm
gonna get some on the brush because I
feel like there's no way that's going to
clean up my brows without making a
bigger mess hey Lauren let's see whoo oh
it's actually kind of nice actually
kinda reminds me and my paint pot by Mac
a little bit I kind of like that I mean
that's just my quick little purse
impressions on it but I kind of loved it
except I'm going to be using a product I
think everyone's pretty excited about
this is the integrity palette from
Jeffrey star it is brand spanking new
and look at that packages honey yeah oh
sorry girl look at the mirror cool and
then here is the coat and the palette
the pans are huge you there's my burn on
my arm first I'm going to go in with
safe board right here I'm going to blend
that right into the crease next time I
take a little bit of dominatrix on this
little bitty eo6 liner brush from Sigma
beYOU these colors are so pigmented I
mean you probably already see how nicely
they blend out and I think I'm gonna do
a cut crease today you guys aren't
familiar with a cut crease or haven't
really done one today will be a great
viewing experience
I like to map out my cut crease like
that
I'm gonna take my morphe Y 18 brush and
I'm just going to soften up that crease
and I'm going to go in it with a little
bit more safer just to blend it out yeah
I'm going to get a little bit more
dominatrix and build up that crease
right there just buff it on in and we
can really define our cut crease and
there's a small stroke to really make
sure it's blended in versus going in
with a heavy hand and make sure you use
very little product less this more you
can always go back in and build it up if
you don't have enough product but don't
go in with a fully loaded brush because
girl it can in sightly okay if this part
gets messy out here we'll go back in and
clean it up
I'm going to go in with a little bit and
drogyny which is perfectly shade right
here I think I'm a booger you guys are
looking at it fill it in my nose
and I'm just going to blend all about
you know so now I'm going to take my
Mac's Paint Pot this is such a trusty
thing to create I cut grease with and
I'm going to take this recipe see e62
brush from Sigma I might go ahead and
cut the crease and clean this up our
next step in the cut crease is a girl
you should not be texting me right now
I'm just going to take this dominatrix
shade which is dark brown I'm literally
just going to trace my eyelid because
obviously the cut crease was above my
eyelid you don't have to do the double
cut crease if you don't want to but I
was like getting crazy today doing
something different that I've never done
on my channel for and I'm just tracing
my actual eyelid like that and then
again it does not be perfect so meditate
a little short shader brush and just
smudge you that on out operate this
palette and not use this gorgeous shade
called a frosting oh it's so pretty so I
just have it on this little flat shading
brush just adding it right there packing
it on the front of the list
so next time I take a little bit of
DejaVu which is this copper color I'm
actually just going to add a little bit
of it to the outer corner I'm going to
add a little bit of eyeliner I'm using
the NYC liquid liner word on the street
is that they're discontinuing this and
if I have one thing to say it is don't
once it's gone I don't know what we'll
do
okay our coast Maddox came out with new
silk flashes I'm going to be wearing
these today these are in and debo I have
it just like setting on my eye you guys
are watching my videos and you're just
like okay now I grow that last lose them
sit there for a minute and be drawing so
just pretend that it's not there and
we're going to go ahead and conceal I'm
going to be using the wet and wild I
really like these concealers it just
says concealer corrector it just our new
ones and these are really affordable as
well
Fedya dolla are also a newer product I
did a video testing I like the new wet
and wild mine so check it out if you
want to know more that's totally up to
you but I can link that video down below
for you guys
I'm going to take my white 11 brush from
morphe this brush is so dirty I swear
guy just pulled a piece of cat litter
out of it don't know how that happened
or if that really was cat litter but
girl we got to have a come-to-jesus
meeting in this house I kept some no
respect for me now I said it I just
think using a little bit of this becca
powder and shea fair set it I don't have
a new really setting powder on deck that
I'm like wanting to test out at all
great I lost the product your
together so I'm going to make sighing
products I will be testing out this is
the hoola kwikki contour stick from
benefit that they just launched that was
like a pretty color I think that's going
to be successful I was scared I've never
tried this in my life so I'm excited
about it I really like the color so
let's see how blends out I hate this
little stippling brush and just snatch
the mountain of hair on the side of my
face it was blending out like
miraculously easy
like I mean link to twice like watch my
forehead just watch how easy let me get
the babies out of the way okay ready
yeah this parks amazing um the only
thing is there's only like one shade for
the thing so kind of a downfall but it's
or it's like the actual product and it's
 it might be my next new favorite
contour product if it's simple and all
this easy girl
okay so I do love that and now I'm going
to try out hoola light I don't know if
it's gonna be too like yeah that's gonna
be way way too light so arch I'm not
going to try this out but I'll let you
know this product is available it's hula
light it's just another color other
hoola bronzer my go ahead and usual I
know some extra contouring so creamy so
the contour stick in the hoola bronzer
they pair well together obviously
they're like I didn't blend out my
channel without I'm leaving this in to
let you know that I am a human and I
make mistakes
I was left and now has a powder on top
of it let's still work down is brutal so
for blood I have this new little star
bronzer palette from Lancome and I'm
going to use this blush shade I'm going
to use a white brush from morphe to get
in there oh very pigmented oh my gosh
you know this blush shade is really
pretty I don't like a lot of pigment on
my cheeks like like it seemed or bronzey
and glowy versus like pink and next time
benefit this video is not sponsored some
benefit ice mattoon event got a bunch of
brand new products in salt you guys
would love to see them but I have the
dandelion
twinkle this is their new baked
highlighter it comes with a little brush
in the box but I took it out from the
brush
hello apply it so this is not this is
more like a little bit of a subtle
highlight this is baked I'm going to add
a little bit of mac fix+ on it and we're
going to judge it up but it is very
pretty if you're not willing to like go
crazy and product and like have like the
extreme nests you see how it's like kind
of settled it very beautiful on the skin
I'm gonna go in with safe word I'm going
to go out with androgyny which for the
hundred times it's purple shades so I
just added a little bit of a cream color
liner into my waterline and on top some
mascara on the lower lashes and we'll
move on to lips so I'm really excited
for lips because I've used these
products and I love them to death these
are the new little lip sticks from
morphe they're only $12.99
so it's like an affordable lipstick out
there and I'm pretty pleased with them
yeah they're a little bit drying I'd be
lying if I did lie
whoo-hoo she's ramen she lying if I
didn't say that but they're not drying
enough to make me like hate them or not
like them liquid lipsticks in general
are a little bit of drying applied
Elysee my applies to color so just
flicking them I love this about how dark
Chelsea is I'm going to apply virgin on
top and if it doesn't lighten it and I'm
just going to take off DLC and just
apply version let's see what happens if
I just end up mixing the two colors and
I like I love the outcome okay I so that
is it for this video as yelled so loud
and I know my mic was like this that's
it for this video
I mean hell I love pretty much
everything in it as you can see I was
talking about the morphe liquid
lipsticks they don't crack she's still
very smooth on the lips they just still
a little bit drying and that's why it's
so tolerable just because it doesn't
look like
on your lips everything else was pretty
much fabulous as you can see on my face
the turn out I really love the way my
makeup looks today I love the foundation
especially when I've said it with a
powder I just have to wear it longer and
see how it wears
I'll leave in the description box how it
wore that way you can read up and like
see my true thoughts and all like the
long wearing of it but as far as the way
it looks I love it and all the products
really worked out I don't think that
ever happened to me in a tested out
video I'm never there's always been
something where it's just a product
today which is a good day that's all I
got to say now I'm rhyming and I need to
get off youtube okay I love you guys
