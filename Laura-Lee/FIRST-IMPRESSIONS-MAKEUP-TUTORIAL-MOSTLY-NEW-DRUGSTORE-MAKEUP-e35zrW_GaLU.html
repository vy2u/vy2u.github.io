princess she said do you look how she's
grown guys she's kingsroad she's gonna
be a big girl hey I love her so much it
just makes me giggle whenever I hold her
hey guys what's up and welcome to my
channel I'm all Valentimes day out and I
got a Valentine's Day backdrop and I'm
ready to test out some makeup and can I
do Valentine's Day look with it so
there's gonna be a first impressions
makeup tutorial I have a ton of mostly
drugstore stuff to test out and a couple
things that aren't from the drugstore
then I'm gonna be using in today's video
but because Valentine's Day it's coming
around and I just picked up this cute
little sweater from forever 21 I thought
it'd be cute to do like a Valentine's
Day look while testing out the makeup
you see what I did there I'm really
excited for today's video because I
partner with buxom which is an
absolutely amazing brand I talked about
them a lot on my channel specifically
their eyeshadows I think they're great
and their glosses but what's awesome is
they just came out with a pop-up plump
new shiny liquid lipsticks and they have
boo qoodles of shades until if you hang
out to the end you will see me use one
of these in the looks and I'll swatch a
couple for you so you guys can see the
shade range have more shape than one I'm
just holding up it legally home they
have every shade you could fathom so
this is a plumping liquid lipstick which
is very interesting it has a shiny look
to it and is also long wearing and
comfortable so it's just like this all
in one little creative creature and I'm
so excited to wear it for today's video
I'll probably choose a brighter color
department since we're doing a
Valentine's Day look to be sure and hang
out to the end of the video to see that
but without further ado I'm gonna sing
some song and we're jump right in to her
video now we can get started and jump
right
okay getting started I want to try out a
new primer that never tried before this
is the Rimmel London lasting finish
breathable primer 8 hour wear makeup
wear and it says it's ultra lightweight
so enough talking about this what it
looks like it has really light great
riding on the packaging kind of hard to
read I picked this up from the drugstore
the other day
remote products are super affordable so
it's excited to try this out and it
looks like a lotion I always smell
products before I put them on my face
and I think you guys should do it too
but you never know like it sounds like a
weird chemical you might not want to use
it so I always keep products like a
really good sniff this one smells like
nothing so it is safe also I literally
just got back from Hawaii and by
literally I mean my plane landed it's 6
o'clock like 6:15 and it's 8 o'clock and
I'm filming I had so much fun it was one
of the best trips of my whole entire
life and I spent it with some of the
most amazing people that I know and that
is a trip I'll never forget follow me on
snapchat you saw the tea
I also blogged it so be sure and
subscribe to my blog channel do that
Steven that video goes up Laura Lee
vlogs also I managed to slide down a
mountainside while I was in Hawaii then
literally went hiking with everybody and
then like on the way down the mountain
somehow my feet went out from under me
and I fell and I slid down the mountain
like in a planking motion I don't know
why would I feel I immediately started
flanking I was like and this is the
aftermath I've literally have scratches
all over me it hurt really bad in the
moment I was laughing so hard it was
like hilarious we're all hiking and I
was go planking down the mountainside
and then after fact everything there's
blood everywhere and then I just found
scratches literally every two seconds I
find like a new scratch on me I'm like
how do they get this me scratches on one
fall little stories time well in the
middle of the video but it was so much
fun best trip ever love Hawaii literally
obsessed for foundation today I want to
be using these super safe foundation by
Maybelline now if you didn't watch my
favorite foundations video well then you
don't know that I love this stuff and I
really wanted to use this in a tested
out video to show you guys more so I
kind of test it out and just show you
guys what it looks like at the end of
that video but I figured why not use it
again in the first impressions it's a
good drugstore product and you guys need
to know more about it so I'm gonna use
it today it's really pretty on skin well
be gonna so it's a little on our face
away see that redness geez
also my face decided to break out and
get bumps everywhere while I was there
because of the humidity which happens to
me whenever like I changed the weather
that I'm in or the atmosphere gonna
blend this out I'm using my white
express from morphe which shops all of
you but say never use this brush do I
newcomers like Steven look at it don't
look at a time because it hurts me if
you're looking at it's hurting me by the
way the shade that I use this foundation
in is 3:10 which is a little bit dark
for me but if you blend it on down oh
but if you wind it down to the neck it's
a colored additional smooth so next up
I'm sorry that's kind of not a first
impressions but I really had talked
about I'm on my channel so I thought it
would be okay to use it in today's video
okay so next up I have the model's own
never really use this brand on my
channel so I thought why not today they
had this new consider that's called
coverage full coverage concealer comes
in this tube like this and it this is
shade light one we're gonna test out
girl that is like Elmer's glue you know
that foundation on my finger now oh my
gosh are we blending this down to my
elbows honey ah no my mom laughs yes
I don't know this combini also the shade
is about 20 shades too light for me okay
so I'm gonna take my wife six brush
which has a little bit of a darker
foundation on it which will help to
morph this concealer shade into my skin
this girl is like tugging my eye to
blend it out like it's so thick it
reminds me a little bit of the bye bye
under our from it cosmetics
but I don't know if it's covering that
well think you'd like
I think this shade of it like
highlighted the area well but the actual
coverage god I feel the weight of it and
I see the pigment and color of it it
should be like insanity coverage because
of how thick it is and it just really is
it so we're gonna set it and forget it
with a little bit of setting powder and
then we'll move onwards yeah went ahead
and Bron set my skin and no I did not
portray you guys and just skip bronzer
not show you guys and tell you guys T
about what bronzer today the reason I
went ahead and Ron said my skin is
because I'm are you trying out like a
shimmery highlighter bronzer on top of
this one I really want us to focus on
the new new so I'm gonna be trying out
the true much lumi glow nude palette so
this is the new highlighting palette
they have a bronze shade right here I'm
gonna try out as well as some of these
for the cheekbones I know you guys
really girl no you did not just put on
bronzer and leave us hanging awesome
having a little bit of like craziness in
the concealer just not my cup of tea
okay first I'll take an hour 14 brush
and tap into whoo a lot comes off its
bronzer
honestly it's pretty I would recommend
just going in with a light hand with it
but it's a really pretty uh like it's a
really pretty bronze bird you can see s
like this golden hue to it so I think
this would be really pretty to bronze up
your skin for the summertime you're
gonna be out in the Sun and let the
light reflect some of your bronzer
reflect the gold and it could be really
beautiful so so far the bronze are not
too bad now mind you it is super
pigmented so I would go in with a light
hand when using it when I take our 36
brush in the peach shade pretty it's
just kind of chunky like I don't know if
you guys can see on camera it's just
kind of like it's literally in my nose
there's just like little chunks I've got
everywhere like powdery chunks of it and
it's also kind of subtle of a
highlighter so if you'd like a more
subtle highlighter and you might like
this I personally go for a little bit
more of a glow and it's pretty though do
you see it's kind of like a subtle the
only thing I don't like it is slightly
chunky like I won't use this every day
but I don't think it's a bad palette
let's see I mean they feel a little dry
I'm not gonna lie to you guys they do
feel a little dried see they're a little
dry and powdery but I mean if you like
the more subtle highlight you might like
these these just aren't my favorite like
just try them out I'm just coming except
I'm really excited to try out this new
brow product total temptation from
Maybelline I got the shade medium brown
you guys see the tip over right there it
is
like a diamond shape is a look at the
lash glue girl the lash glue in the lash
line she cannot get it together
so far it is waxy but this is a good for
all pencil come on pigment
so I do like the bra pen so I think it's
nice it is a little bit heavy on the wax
side which just can cause you to lose
some brow there so you have to be
careful with that but like as far as the
pigment at all
it's a good brow pencil and I like the
little ball fully on there and I feel
like you're really snatches the hairs so
I do like it um really waxy products
will just tear out your brow hair so
just be aware and be very gentle and
careful with super waxy product you know
I definitely could see me using this
again for sure you guys see me a week
later with no brow hairs you're like did
you keep using the pencil or just
getting a man dramatic it's not gonna
tear out all your brow hair your
eyeshadow I'm gonna try out the morphe
at 24g palette I'm not used to so my
channel I used it in a IG tutorial and
it's like perfect for Valentine's Day so
I'm going to go in with this shade at
first and I'm blend it all over I just
carved out my brows a little bit
concealer so you know she's gotta
lighten up the stickiness so everything
blends out really easily and by the way
this is the m57
3 brush I normally always start my looks
with this brush and it's just nice and
fluffy a little blender I just want to
create like a really bright pink eye
with a beautiful fluttery lash and then
a hot pink lippy today it's kind of when
I'm feeling next I'll tap into this
caramel shade right here you know I'm
just gonna go back and forth in the
crease with this a r39 brush
next I'm gonna pack on this pink shade
I'm gonna grab some over the m45 brush
and really pack it on the eyelid cuz I
want this shade to like pop and really
show up so we can show our beautiful
pink Valentine's Day eye Valentine
someone's gonna call me on the comment
section for same time
oh we do next I'll go back to my r36
brush and just soften up all those harsh
edges you can even tap a little of the
pink on the brush and just soften him up
this pink shade was really pigmented so
it made it very easy to work with I had
to add on a lot of color it's rare that
I do like all over one color look which
I technically didn't use one color and
why don't you do something like that for
today I'll grab this light shimmer shade
with the m32 six little detail brush I'm
gonna highlight their brow bone and pop
some of that in the inner corner as well
next I'm gonna wing it out I love a good
thick wing liner
all righty we're gonna try out the total
temptation mascara which is new from
Maybelline and I like the brush I love
the mystery brushes like this ooh these
eyes on pink baby doll pike so far the
mascara is pretty nice I do I do I do I
like the mask oh okay just gonna pop on
a Miami
deal we gonna go in with the pink shade
again with a Y 14 brush and I'll pop
this right there on that lower lash nut
I'm gonna use some of this mascara on
the lower lash line and it is pretty
nice I would say it's more like spread
them out and not so much thickening of a
mascara but I really like it I don't
know why but I so so so so badly gonna
add a little bit of glitter to my eyes I
can't help it I'm such a glitter fanatic
lately I just can't help it I need to
know what this palette is like it's just
this urban light palette I in cheek
palette gonna try a little bit of the
blush and it'll put on barely tap to do
it it's so much product come on oh the
blush is pretty but extremely like fall
out e in the palette has like a lot of
shimmer in the blush so beware because
that can pick up on pores and texture
I'm good I do like the blush oh this
feels so creamy it feel kind of flaky
but like really like these are like
cream eyeshadow I just want to show to
you holy boo goalies these are cool now
the fun time comes we get to try on the
lip it which I'm super excited about so
I like I said I want to do a super hoppy
color but first I'm gonna put on news so
you guys can see two lip options with I
know not everyone wants a super hot pink
look if this one looks really pretty
this one is called honeydew so it comes
on doe foot applicator
he can see I was able to completely
cover my lips with one pullout so it has
a lot of pigment to it and it was very
even in color you guys can see has a
curved applicator so this way it's
really easy to put the product on and
gives you a precise application and you
do get a little bit of the plumping
tingle with these which feels really
good I'm gonna use the color
kiss-and-tell which is a super vivid
pink shade oh girl
I love this hot pink is so pretty
for valentim st. has a shine to it and
also very comfortable to wear so you
could wear it out all night loves it
