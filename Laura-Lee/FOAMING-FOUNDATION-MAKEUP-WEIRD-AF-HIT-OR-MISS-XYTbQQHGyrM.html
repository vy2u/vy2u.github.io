channel today's video is going to be
testing out a foaming foundation this is
called the flawless finish mousse makeup
by Elizabeth Arden New York and they sit
me in this foaming foundation excuse me
what is this this is what it looks like
it comes in a little tin can with a pump
on it and I am just literally baffled as
like how this is gonna work out so I'm
gonna apply it in this video and show
you guys what it looks like and how it
applies and all that jazz and then I'm
gonna wear it throughout the day and I'm
going to do check-ins for you guys and
we're gonna do a long wear test I'm
really curious and excited to see like
what is about to happen to my face so
without further ado we're gonna go ahead
and sing the SUBSCRIBE song and then
look at a jump right into the video
subscribe to my channel you need
subscribe give me that perrolli go ahead
and jump right
my husband's leaf blowing the ashes off
of our porch right now so I'm kinda
hoping you can't hear that in the video
because that would be annoying so we're
gonna try it out I hate they send me the
shade beige 40 it says shake the can
well press down quickly three times for
usage then press once each measured
application palm into hand and blend
using your fingertips so your other
supposed to use your fingertips with
this it says that this product is sold
at Walmart for 20 bucks or Macy's for 35
bucks the light airy cloud color
provides just enough coverage for a
beautiful complexion giving the skin a
natural light feeling so as a natural
finish it's great for minimalist so it's
not full coverage now I'm gonna be
biased and be like I hate it
no I'm kidding so at least we know it's
not specific full coverage so it says
shake it well it sounds super liquidy
we're gonna give it a good shake you
should let me do let me do is what we
can all see together ill oh okay oh just
fell on the floor oh it's all in my
carpet okay it's everywhere oh my god
described as a mess
I literally have it running down the
front of my shirt and all in my carpet
right now can I see that is that not
like the gag of the century watch that
looks like dog poop okay so it says
ticket look how Airy it is it just
kind of turns into like foundation II it
says rub in with your fingers which the
gag of the season is this is like
there's nothing on my skin this was not
kidding whenever it says for minimalist
Lynnae this is for like this is like
moisturizer okay and my face is turning
light
okay Real Talk my skin pills very breezy
very Schottky see how shiny it is it
just feels like I put greasiness all
over my face we have to go ahead and
test it out for you guys like that's
just part of my job
that's just tea so what I'm gonna do is
apply some concealer and some bronzer as
I normally would see how it wears with
other makeup products I'm gonna see how
girls somebody's got a cover these bags
as lord knows that foundation didn't and
these bags are not Chanel didn't cover
any zips it doesn't claim to though so I
can be mad at that it's gonna take a
little why six to go Christmas shopping
after this we'll do check-ins we're
gonna do a little iPhone X log in this
video it'll be fun
we'll hang out together slowly bit a
setting powder for that concealer
oh we've in a setting powder she makes
her whole entire face hmm I'm gonna take
a wild guess
that off I'm gonna add a little bit of
this Stila bronzer my skin like it was
obviously too light for me so I'm
counting I'm not my normal color
that's okay we can add bronzer and it's
more onto that okay her face is I'm
gonna put on a little round my ladder
and then be done next time you see me
will be in a few hours we're gonna do a
check-in I just added the bronzer
concealer and setting powder I'm
actually gonna hit it with some mac fix+
to kinda to kind of settle down all the
powders I put on my face alright guys
I'll be back this is my to our check-in
I figure it would be a good time to do a
check-in honestly like you can see so
much my skin through the foundation just
like right through it mmm
but I mean that still looks pretty
decent
so you can just see on my skin I don't
know I don't know how I feel about it
we're gonna check in a little bit later
and see the tea I need to buckle up
oh she is a greasy AF little shiny so if
you have oily skin I'm not gonna suggest
this foundation to you mm-hmm
I took off my lippy and I have my visit
line in that's the update on that too
soon no I have seen lips and a lisp I
don't know like the highlights popping
okay but that little shiny and like
right there here whoo there's no
highlight right there so we know that
this foundation is not probably skin I'm
gonna do one more check in it is what I
think it's like 4:30 right now an
afternoon so one more check in and we'll
see hey guys I'm doing my last check-in
in a public bathroom it literally I look
so wet and dewy and you can just it
looks like I don't have any foundation
on just to be honest it's like 10
o'clock at night obviously this is a
super long wear test Jesus started like
11 10 11 hour over here test girl you
see all the blue so it ain't long
wearing in a full coverage it's a quick
little beach day foundation I hope you
