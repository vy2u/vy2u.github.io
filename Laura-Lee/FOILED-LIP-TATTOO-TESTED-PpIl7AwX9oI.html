can we get three seconds without someone
texting me today's video is going to be
a very cool video do I say that in every
intro I feel like I do but I wouldn't
make the video unless I felt like it was
gonna be a good or cool video you know
what I'm sorry I found this product off
amazon.com so I bought it this is called
lip rock and it's metallic foil lips
it's like a lip stamp and you peel it
off and it's supposed to give you really
cool looking lips like this
I am super skeptical I don't see this
working out it's high even saw it come
in and he was like what is that that is
not gonna work what better way to test
out than in a youtube video with you
guys because what if it does work so
we're gonna be testing it out in today's
video because who doesn't want foil lips
be sure to subscribe to my channel for
more weird stuff that I might find on
the internet and show you and test it
out does it work we don't know we'll
find out together let's jump right in
the video and get started so in the
packet luckily comes instructions
basically you need to have your lips
clean which is why I didn't have any
lipstick on in my intro nor do I right
now and it has to be cleaned with an
oil-free product that way the lips are
just bare creepy thing that I'm not
really comfortable putting on my list
but I'm gonna do it anyways cuz I'm
doing it for the YouTube is lip gras lip
rock application glue
apply a generous amount of lip Rock
adhesive to the lips leave on for two
minutes until the white adhesive has
gone clear taking your chosen sheet so
we're going to do pinks that's what we
have today I apply shiny side out to the
lips the tricky thing is that both sides
are shiny the little picture it looks
like they applied the metallic colorful
side out so that's what I'm going to do
as firmly holding the corners of your
mouth with one hand pull the lip rock
cheap firmly and swiftly off the lips so
first we're gonna start off by a point I
just read you guys all that you probably
like can you just do it already
okay alright here I go this is stinks
this smells like chemicals and that it
should never be put on the lips okay I
mean it might be say it's got to be safe
right I'm assuming wherever you put the
adhesive is where the foil is gonna be
so you want to get it really even feel
like I got them nicely coated you can
feel the adhesive getting really stiff
and you can feel it kind of drawing on
the lips now I'm going to take a little
foils I think we only get three foils
per packet so you get three chances to
get this right okay the pressure is on
can't even get it open huh okay so the
foils are very very thin and could tear
easy you want to be careful let me
swinging it around getting crazy with it
I'm going to wait for it to dry just a
little more this is supposed to be clear
but I feel like it is all the way clear
that it's gonna be all the way dry I'm
excited all you guys are gonna work
heads up to remove use a facial
cleansing wipe or makeup removing lotion
the foil will come off when in contact
with any oil so don't go out and order a
salad with vinaigrette dressing I'm
gonna do it this feels so tacky that my
lips touch they're gonna like together
so I think we're ready whoo
only a mirror adjusted here we go here
we go are you nervous I'm nervous let's
do it like this oh this is not working
hello hello what just happened I see how
it works and I did apply it correctly
maybe I didn't let the glue dry
correctly so I feel like what we could
do to fix this is now maybe put some
more glue and try again it ripped the
heck out of any little hairs around your
mouth so for us people with mustaches it
will rip your mustache out that glue is
tacky I'm going to give it a go and try
to fix what we can this area turned out
okay like it looked like it was going to
be good and then it just went to hell in
a handbasket over here
to let the glue dry for a little bit
longer hoping that we have a more
appealing look okay here I go I'm not
looking or good I wasn't at work this is
baloney it got on my tongue but I don't
taste anything and I try to open my
mouth a little more so you get really
good in there and nothing happened
nothing why not what's going on what am
I doing wrong I'm going to give the
bottom lip since I'm tough Lu is tired
of being layered up and pulled on I'm
gonna get the bottom lip ago I'm gonna
wipe off what I have and try to do the
bottom lip one more time just to see it
comes off easy this is not an old based
makeup wipe either I don't even know how
to describe what I look like right now
all right guys it's clear and I feel
like we're ready let's do it work
kind of work on the top lip I tried
three different times on the bottom lip
and a total failure I mean I do not
recommend these whatsoever these are
crazy and it looks like poo on my lips
it looks like gold flaky metallic pink
poo so that's it for this video guys
thank you so much for being here and
watching be sure to check out my last
video hanging out right over there yep
