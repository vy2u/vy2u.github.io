weird welcome let me do it one more time
hey guys look at my channel today's
video is going to be testing out forever
21 Nick
you guys have requested a couple well a
couple of you guys have requested that I
do this and yesterday I went to forever
21 so I've been in there forever
just to grab a couple pieces of clothing
and/or see what was good you know see
what's good ever 21 looks good I
actually win the makeup section they had
so many different products so I was like
um hi hello YouTube video right here so
I grabbed up as many products as pretty
much that they had and I'm going to be
trying out for you in this video and
we're going to find out the hots and the
knots and the hips and the Misses and
all the good in the bad but I hope you
guys are excited for the video and share
to show swatch on my channel before you
leave and you can even hit that little
notification bill and it will let you
know when I posted video in that time
spottin let's jump right in and get
started
well okay starting out I had makeup all
over my face because I'm going to be
testing out the sponges and I got three
is sponges for seven dollars and eighty
ninety cents I'm like that around eight
dollars so these so really hard and we
went ahead and wet this one and it feels
pretty darn soft look at the size it was
like the size of this one and now it's
like double the size so it definitely
expands it feels really soft let's see
how it blends out this foundation that
I've put on my face just drinking my
foundation
Oh drink on my cell nation I feel like
this sponge is definitely just Cohen
might be too light for me that I'm
trying out but anyway since life
definitely is not as soft as the
Beautyblender but it is doable like it's
not like a bad makeup sponge like it's
so spongy that it's like literally just
sucked up all my product in it though
because I had a lot of foundation on my
face by the way I was testing out the
Giorgio Armani a powder fabric long wear
high coverage foundation right here and
I truly feel like this bunch just sucked
up every single bit of it I have makeup
forever Make Up For Ever women talking
about it's over 21 foundation so this is
what i am trying out testing out shade
5.5 it looks a little ashy on me but the
foundation looks good I'm just kind of
pissed because I literally drink of all
of my products so these sponges girl
even though it's soaking wet
still I next up I really want to test
out the eyeshadows I'm going to go ahead
and show them to you I was a little
shocked whenever I took it out of the
black box or they came in I paid nine
dollars for each palette and the
packaging is super lightweight it feels
really cheap just be honest with you
guys this how is the shimmer palette and
then I open it up and it's like
exploding shimmer everywhere let's go
ahead and have the conversation we all
know what I'm going to do with this get
out of here the palette just honestly
looks like Dollar Tree makeup I think
honestly I think nine dollars is too
much for this palette granite it's a big
palette and it comes with a lot of
shades but I'm over here like girl well
a little bit they just are really chalky
and flaky honestly they have a little
bit of pigment on them but they still
remind me a dollar tree eye shadow if
you guys don't know I did a video it was
a while back where I just out Dollar
Tree makeup and like that is what's the
peace plum experiment of me up Sonam
Dallas I also got a cooler one it's
called the baked eyeshadow palette and
it exploded everywhere as soon as I took
you out of packaging so it's kind of
like are you kidding me sort of like why
is it
oh my god all the eye shows just like
fell out whenever I try to show it to
you guys okay hey chill literally just
like plummeted out of the packaging okay
let's just pretend that they didn't fall
out and then let's do some swatches
honestly the swatch they're a little bit
chalky and dry still but they swatch
better than the shimmer eyeshadow
palette Oh one was like this videos turn
it into a mess I mean honestly when I
review things I do try to keep it
relative to the price I don't go a
review like a super affordable
foundation it expected to be like a
Giorgio Armani foundation although
sometimes they do turn out to be that
good like it's just thrown together
cheap makeup and I feel like the price
point even though it is an affordable
price point is still a little bit high
just because like I've experimented with
a lot of a little makeup in my time on
the internet and this may commit is like
some of the cheapest that I've dealt
with and it just reminds me of dollars
remake of Anishinabe sold for you know
$8 $9 who you playing oh I'm still going
to try to get a creative look out of it
to show you guys the usage of it I'm
going to go ahead and prime my eyelid
with my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre that
I use pretty much every single day by
the way I did smarsh the liner that came
in here and this is like a bunch of
swatches but it still came off pretty
decently so the on liner not too shabby
any anyway these are your lips come
clean my mirror right now cleaning
killeen first I'm going to go in with
this neutral champagne color on my
eyelid right here because these shadows
are baked and I am aware that most baked
products work better if you dampen them
a little bit I am going to wet them
kidding however I used to lick my
brushes all the time and
if you want to lick your brushes at home
go for it and so I'm actually going to
pack this on and if you wet them it's
actually looking kind of nice you can
see it's not like insane pigmentation or
anything like that but it's not that
it's not bad on this and never here to
have this really pretty purple color and
I'm just going to try a - a little bit
about on my outer corner purple seems to
be coming off more as a black color
alone but it is a little bit more
pigmented mordy mordy
so the eyeshadows wet are actually kind
of pretty and I didn't even let the
purple color and it seems like the
darker colors have a little more
pigmentation and they're not that bad
this palette is so goofy and like puffy
and chalky that I'm not even playing
with this today it's disappointing and I
don't recommend her to you next up this
brow powder duo with some wax and brow
powder it's been a long time since I
used a product like this being dead
honest with you guys I always use a brow
pencil or my dip brow pomade in some of
my music a wax and a powder mix together
in a long time so I'm going to try to do
this wish me luck and see the best
because I believe this was like so
incredibly affordable and if it works
that's amazing this one is in cocoa
cocoa yeah but this shade looks a little
bit warm
girls got me nervous I'm going to take
my morphe e 29 brush and trying to make
this brown come to life y'all better be
wishing me luck
at wax and like brow powder do work well
together and I'm the color doesn't
exactly match it is a little bit warm
tone as I figured for my brows but I
think overall the products really nice
and I am going to recommend their brow
products to you guys I mean that it's
not shabby okay the brow product is
definitely a winner X I'm gonna pop on a
little bit of a calm sea lift and now
we're going to go back to our little
spongey here and pray that it doesn't
soak up all the product please if you
can see it just still drinking a lot of
my products okay I mean they're not cool
I mean it's blending it but it's just
like a freakin Affordable sponge it's
kind of doing more damage than good
whenever it's drinking all the products
clothing right along another exciting
product to try out from them is their
face pallet contour kit it's a way
better a little bit chalky but it feels
way better than the eyeshadows you can
see it's a little dusty don't know it
doesn't feel bad the shade here on the
end though is more of a highlighting
shake its galois shimmer in it like a
contour or highlighting situation this
one kind of - this one's definitely for
setting and I use this one right here to
contour a lot comes all so it's
definitely got some spunk to it and it
seems like I mean this shade is a wee
bit deep for me to set my concealer
because it's darkening it back up but
actually this one has a little bit of a
sheen to it so I don't want to put
shimmer on my under eye not bad though I
think the product itself is like a nice
little product it's very soft so that
was really soft and I liked it - no it's
contour I'm going to be using a more pe4
brush tip an angled brush again a lot of
product comes off oh that's pretty
I wish my eyebrows were kind of reddish
because they're not really matching me
we'll just pretend that they're not okay
when the contour kit is not like
everything you dreamed up but I think
it's a nice contour kit and for the
price I see
it does a good job see a lot of
pigmentation it's not patchy so it's
just a bit dry definitely nothing in the
world women if you want to say nothing
about it we might be onto something here
people except from forever21 I got this
pretty ombre blush it kinda reminds me
of those Knicks ombre blushes I believe
this was around five to six dollars and
just rubbing it all together oh it's
bright disappears once you rub it in but
I'm going to try it on my cheeks anyways
I'm going to try to stick to the deeper
side so that way we don't get too much
of a bright white color on my cheeks
honestly it's very shimmery and it's
picking up a lot of texture it's
literally just putting shimmer on my
face it's not actually putting the peach
color on my face so this kind of sorta
is more of a highlighter so I'm going to
take this in and try to use it as a
highlighter I kind of sound like it
wants to be a blush but instead it's
alter-ego as a highlighter and it's not
being a very good highlighter which is
like a peachy dull highlighter
yeah I'm not living for this product I'm
not going to recommend it to you guys
although it is super pretty in the
packaging and it sold me on how cute it
was a girl now kind of even do it it's
kind of hit and miss situation we got
going on here I just went ahead and add
it a little bit of wine liner cuz you
know when in doubt go fine you can just
wing it on out and next we're gonna be
trying out the VIP lash mascara
I've never even opened it oh well hello
funky wand this reminds me what mascara
my thinking of guys is a drugstore
mascara that looks like this I mean my
lashes are not all that about your chips
so I have to base it off of what they
normally look like but so far they look
pretty good I mean you can see they're
kind of curling see how they're kind of
curling up a little bit with it it's
building up nicely
hey overall thoughts on the mascara it's
spread your lashes out super thin it
doesn't make of chunky whatsoever but it
definitely curls the lashes which I love
about it so I do recommend this mascara
now we all like our lashes a little
different so just obviously to pick on
what you like your lashes to look like
but but I like sin and spread apart but
yet lifted so I do like to mascara she
was cool I picked up some lashes from
them these were only two dollars and
ninety cents I just applied the lashes
and they went on really easy they're
kind of thin so they're kind of hard to
see like was my liner but there are
really pretty lashes and I mean they're
$2.90 so you can definitely use these
because they're plasticky and yeah they
don't look too unnatural or like
anything while so I kind of like them I
also just want to share this with you
while there's pic of this gel eye shadow
and it is a whip cream filling eye
shadow Alice we thought it was a blush
until I got it home and I actually read
what it was huh it honestly feels like
children's play makeup and it's sticky
and kind of a no it's enough for me
get out of here except guys I picked up
some of these liquid lipsticks and I
think these were around five to six
dollars and then I went ahead and swatch
them for you guys to see they were super
watery but they had a lot of
pigmentation
so they could wear really well on the
lips let's try them on and find out all
right so here it's a nude one they smell
really good they smelling vanilla okay
guys so I finished my makeup and let me
do my final thoughts on these products
obviously they were extremely hit and
miss I think about a half of the
products worked half of them didn't the
liquid lipstick doesn't actually dry
down completely so it's not kiss proof I
didn't realize that but it is a pretty
product it's like a semi matte glossy
pigmentation situation here and then the
eyeshadow palette the baked one I think
is really pretty if you wet the
eyeshadows I mean I don't think it's the
best I showed in the world but I think
it's worth the $8 if you wet them
they're good the shimmery eyeshadow
palette is a joke the contour kit is
nice I like the colors I think it's
worth the money the peach ombre the
blush highlighter is a situation that
I'm not up for this punches were nice
and soft but honestly I won't be using
these because I find that they soak up a
lot your product and it was just kind of
a waste mascara I liked it lashes I like
them was that everything on the brow
products girl the color is a myth what
the brow product was nice
so I mean hit and miss per usual and I
completely forgot to show you guys I
used it forever 21 liner pin and I liked
it a lot however does dry kind of
shimmery with a little bit of shine it
doesn't dry completely matte but the
liner pen was really nice it was so
incredibly affordable I definitely think
it's worth some money
and that's about it for this video my
party people I mean that is just yeah we
tried it out and here we are thanks for
being here I'm watching you guys know I
love you so much and I will see you all
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
