happy that she was happy nice what I
would always do could you know I don't
know people like have like they're
saying with makeup with this they know
what they are saying in their vision
looks good on them versus what you do
sometimes like I had a bride that is
just like even my mom told me she's like
a blush fanatic and

her the blush and said go in got it if I
don't think it looks good at your name
