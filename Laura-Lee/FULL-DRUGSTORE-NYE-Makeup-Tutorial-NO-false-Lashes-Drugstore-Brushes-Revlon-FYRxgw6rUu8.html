hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a drugstore makeup
tutorial I used all Revlon products and
I'm creating this festive holiday look
the main attraction is on the eyes I did
a somewhat sparkly eye with a smoked out
plum eyeliner I use some new products
from Revlon by the way I did use the
Revlon Colorstay this is the two-in-one
angled Kajal eyeliner this one is in the
shade fig it has the liner side right
here it's like a little eyeliner that
comes up and then on the other end it
comes with a little angled brush to help
you smoke out the liner and that's what
I did on my eyelids and then for my lid
I did use the new Revlon Colorstay this
is the cream eyeshadow and blackcurrant
it looks like this on the lid as a ridge
tab which is you pull down you get a
little brush with it in my tutorials I
normally don't always show me doing my
eyebrows but I did do my eyebrows in
this world with a drugstore product this
is the Revlon Colorstay eyebrow pencil
this one is in two tin soft brown and it
looks like this has a little spoolie on
the end to brush through your brows and
I show you how to put this bad boy in
work we didn't use any false lashes so
it's super easy peasy lemon squeezy also
be sure and subscribe to my channel
before you leave and we're going to go
ahead and we're gonna jump into the
video let's get started starting out
this tutorial I'm gonna start with my
eyebrows and I use the colors a brow
pencil by Revlon in the shade soft brown
I start brushing them through with the
spoolie and then I start filling them in
with soft feather strokes with the
actual brow pencil this is a long
wearing waterproof formula lasts up to
24 hours it also has a unique angled tip
that helps me give the brows a little
bit of definition and then again I like
to fill them in and use the spoolie just
smooth out the product throughout the
brows that way it gives it a little bit
more of a natural look
and while our eyebrows are done next
we're going to move into a shadow so I'm
going to use not just nudes palette and
also I'm taking is the light brown shade
and the brush that came with the palette
and I'm going to blend that in the
crease and I'm just going to grab a
deeper shade these are just transition
shades and I'm just going to pop that in
the crease as well to deepen it up a
little bit and for the main attraction
I'm using the Revlon Colorstay cream
shadow and this has a built in brush and
just slide it out I'll show you how I
use the brush I just dip it in the
product and then I apply it to my
eyelids this colors really pretty it's
called black currant there are a total
of twelve shades with these cream pots
but I am choosing this one because it
has a little bit of sparkle and I like
the way it looks this is very long
wearing it can last up to 24 hours and
is a cream eyeshadow easy to apply and
it has lots of color payoff this is one
of my favorite parts of the look this is
the liner and I'm going to using the
color stay two in one angled Kajal liner
this one is in shade fig and it has a
chiseled liner tip and it's really easy
to apply very creamy very pigmented so
you don't have to use a heavy hand with
this you can use a very light hand is
also available in for sultry colors and
the smudger brush on the end of it which
I thought was very unique is a great way
to smudge out the liner which will see
me do in just a second but as you can
see like just with an easy swipe you get
so much pigmentation for this look I
actually decided to wing it out you
don't have to if you're not comfortable
with a winged liner you can simply leave
it as I had it right there but I like
the drama and I really wanted the eyes
to be the main attraction of this look
so I decided to add a little bit of a
wing and then I wanted it not to be so
harsh so I decided to take the brush
side of the liner and smoke it out
I've already curled my lashes I'm going
to grab the volume and length mascara
from Revlon and pop this on to my lashes
to add drama like I said in the intro no
falsies included so then I go ahead and
take the liner and I feel it in the
waterline and then I add just a touch to
the outer corner of the eye and then I
use that brush on it to smoke it out and
that way we have a little bit of color
on the lower lash line and this can also
widen the eyes and make them a little
really beautiful smoky sultry and awake
I'm also going to pop a little bit of
that same mascara to my lower lashes now
for the face makeup I'm taking the
Revlon Colorstay foundation and this
foundation brush I'm just going to apply
this to my face as I normally do and
just blend it out and make sure that we
have a flawless finish
that might take the Revlon Colorstay
concealer this one my favorite drugstore
concealers and when I applied this my
other areas a little stripe down the
nose the Cupid's bow the chin adds a
little bit to my forehead and this is
highlighting the face so whenever you
highlight the face you're really pushing
out areas that you want to show more and
look more awake and brighter so now I'm
going to blend that out with the same
brush that I used to blend at my
foundation just make sure there's a soft
ball is finish no harsh edges you
definitely don't wanna be able to see
where the product starts and stops now
I'm going to set everything with my
Revlon Photoready powder to set
everything in place next I'm going to go
in and add some Revlon bronzer I'm using
a fluffy bronzer brush I didn't really
want to contour my face I just really
wanted to bronze it up and give it a
little bit of color so I just add it to
the temples the cheekbone areas maybe a
little bit to the chin and jawline with
a soft brush and this bronzer I normally
go one to two shades darker than my
foundation next I'm going to go ahead
and take this highlighter stick and I'm
going to apply it to my nose my Cupid's
bow and the cheekbone area this is a
really pretty champagne light color and
it just gives a pop of glow which is
super beautiful for a nighttime look it
makes you look really healthy and
glowing next I'm going to take the
Revlon Ultra HD matte lip color and
apply this to my lips and that's it for
this look guys thank you so much for
