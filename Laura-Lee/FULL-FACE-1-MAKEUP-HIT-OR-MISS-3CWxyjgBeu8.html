video it's going to be me testing one
dollar makeup one dollar you guys
suggested that I go to the site shop
miss a calm and they had loads of makeup
for one dollar and you opened up a world
of one dollar makeup so I bought a ton
of it to test how for you guys to see
which products are a hit in a Miss so
that's what we're going to be doing
today I have not tested it out yet
that's why you see the barefaced here
real quick I'm giving away a mess and
all you gotta do is we subscribe to my
channel to enter and I'm going to pick a
winner on I press today but I'll put the
day right here where I'm going to pick
the winner and I'll announce the winner
in later videos be sure and subscribed
and you're injured if you're already
subscribed well then girl you are
already entered I see you without
further ado we're going to jump right
into the video and get started talking
out this super affordable makeup
hopefully some of us a hint I was
feeling there's gonna be some misses
we'll see what happens let's get started
okay I'm going to put my hair back
please make sure you get lots of
rubberband lines in my hair this video
is probably gonna be a little bit of a
longer one that you guys are always
rooting for a longer video so shall we
alright here it is I have every product
but I don't have anything for brows I
don't know why I don't have anything for
brows I feel like there was something on
the side maybe I just didn't come in I
don't know I'll start off with primer I
got the wonder skin poreless primer it
looks like hair gel tell me that does
not look like clear hair gel alright I'm
going to it feels like clear hair gel it
feels just like a wet gel I thought I
was going to feel silicone II but it
does not so smells good it's cruelty
free how do you just apply it to your
moisturize skin okay oh look and again
nigga dead princess oh my primer feels a
little bit tacky but pretty much dry
very interesting we'll jump right into
the foundation I bought two shades aqua
stylish silky milk foundation this is
all free and has SPF 20 in it
I got shade five and six I think I'm
going to try shade six here's what it
looks like in case you guys are
interested it came with a package a
little dirty yeah I think it came like
that that's okay though I mean it
probably was just in a weird house it's
still really nicely so I'm not really
worried about it
that's cake honey cake cakes in them
about foot in my face and now after
squirting it out I'm going to use shade
five because I now know that shade six
is not my shade okay we are learning
here shade five it is or to go ahead and
squirt some out girl this is thick and
it's got me a little worried okay that
looks a little bit closer to my shade
very thick product kind of reminds me of
that Rimmel I don't know how it's called
worker health I hate that I'm being
skeptical but I did a Dollar Tree makeup
tutorial moment a while back and things
didn't turn out so well so I feel like I
have the right to be skeptical you know
here's the kicker I'm not going to be
using my wife's express from morphine
you guys are like cuz I found a brush on
the website that was $1.00 by a toe a
studio hi-def brush it's like a little
slanted kabuki and I figured I figured I
would go ahead and test out the brush
while we're here this is thick it smells
like potpourri it's looking a little
orange the thing that's getting me the
most about it is the fact that it has no
coverage even though it's thickest cake
do you see straight through my skin
super shiny girl what is this I'm
putting on my face I mean you see like
no coverage I don't understand how they
made a product this thick but with no
coverage okay this one we use these
videos because we like to learn together
but I'm looking a mess right now cool so
I I'm going to be honest I feel gross
think my face just feels like very heavy
and wet right now let's move on I
actually got a little contour kit and it
feels kind of nice it was a dollar
makeover essentials contour kit and it
came with a brush and a mirror let's
drop the brush might a the shade right
here and trust that some sound
I am just going to use my own brush a
lot of product comes off whenever you
pat it and it does not smell like
anything so that's good good that it
doesn't have like the chemically or the
potpourri scent okay the foundation is
looking better because I set it with a
powder to try to alleviate a little bit
of the cakiness or the wet look so now
I'm going to mix together these two
shades and I'm going to go ahead and
contour contour it up honey you get a
lot of pigment that comes off of this
this is a M 581 brush I'm going to go
ahead get that cheek
bring it on around the town hmm I mean
I'm going to be honest like it's not
that pigmented on my face I'm going to
build it up a bad though is a dollar we
have to consider that and take that into
our factor means not that shabby right
oh my gosh and bro guys it broke I have
a concealer plus foundation I just want
the shade light to use it as a concealer
and my dope foot applicator just broke
right off the stick cool I'll just shove
it back on there okay but now oh the
product I can just squeeze it right out
look at that and we'll just dab it like
that and now we're going to apply it to
our face it's very thick I'm hoping it's
going to have more coverage than the
foundation that is like okay now let's
stay in there all right cool
I'm going to take a Sigma F 79 brush and
start patting it out concealer is thick
but it has way more coverage than the
foundation so this is not hmm
it's rough as a product has a lot of
coverage oh I mean I'm probably woulda
went with a little bit of a darker shade
but you know it's testing it out and
trying to find my shades online and
honestly they didn't have that grade of
like pictures so did the best that I
could
and the thing is I did buy two shades
with the next shade that I bought was a
shade lighter I'm going to go ahead and
prime my eyelids too with this concealer
not shabby huh we have a win my friends
we have a win okay all right so next I'm
going to go in oh look it stays open I
love that about this I'm going to go in
with the banana shade right here I take
a our three brush from morphe look how
much product comes off whoa and I'm just
going to set it set it and forget it
just going to pack that on kind of like
baking right now even though I didn't
mean to because so much product comes
off interesting okay this is a very
powdery palate but for a dollar it's not
bad next up I brought a little blush and
highlighter duo it looks really cute the
breath of blush is super pink so I'll
definitely go in with a very light hand
because I'm not really into like hot
pink cheeks and all I like a more subtle
blush sometimes to even go without blush
I've been doing that lately I'm gonna
take a more feet Y for brush and oh yes
we have pigmentation very pigmented oh
god it smells and did I do okay
I went in still with a heavy hand and I
barely touched this product this is not
a good color get off of me
it's just not mmm I'm not here for this
blush I feel like she's way too pink for
me the highlight shade though has a lot
of pigment let's see what happens when
applying it to the face I picked them up
on my little okay why is the highlight
so freakin pretty okay for a dollar this
is a win I hate the blush just being
honest tbh I love when people leave a
really mean comment and they put tbh
behind it and it's like that's a way of
justifying your comments since you're
being an honest person that way it's not
rude cuz you're just being honest
highlights pretty contour palette bat
not bad concealers pretty decent I'm
kind of surprised right now I'm not
gonna lie a lot better than the Dollar
Tree makeup I have to tell you so next
we'll move on to some eyeshadow I don't
have any brow products so let me just
fill in my brows real quick let's just
pretend that those magically appear on
my face and we'll keep it the video
rollin I bought some amused cosmetics
these are $1 apiece i shadow z' and they
looked really pretty it well something
nice transitioning neutral colors and
and I brought a little palette which
just wants one of the shades and the
shade so really nice and creamy so I'm
like okay and yeah these are little
pigmented eyeshadows they are teeny tiny
in the pan but they might surprise us
so first want to go in with the shade
nude I'm going to blend this in as my
transition shade just really hitting the
crease it's really pretty and it's
blending out nice like it's got pigment
behind it next I'm going to take the
shade cinnamon look how much product
comes off you definitely do tap it you
get a lot of product I'm just going to
buff this right on in the crease as well
move on the outer corner and then I like
to buff it on out the edges right here
so they're really blended and then I'll
bring it on in and just swipe whatever
is left around the inner corner that way
you don't get too much product on the
inner corner I'm gonna take paparika
that's a cute name for this shadow and
I'm just going to take this morphe are
30 and 9 brush and I'm going to focus it
right in that upper crease right up in
there oh my god these are so pigmented
these are more pigmented than most
high-end shadows honey what in the
tarnation so we got going on party
people
what about would you look at my goodness
I truly have been truck hello when
people get mad at me for saying none
shook alright girls and boys I ain't mad
at it moving along I'm going to take
chocolate which is just a deeper brown
color and these are all matte of course
and I'm going to focus chocolate right
on that outer edge
okay now I'm going to take whoo there's
a lot of pretty colors I think I'm going
to take it look at that look at the
swatch out of this little bugger right
here I highly recommend this guy the
girl what are we gonna do this oh so
what I'm going to do is a little bit of
fallout and the big deal I did get a lot
of it on my brush it's so pigmented like
you could cut your own crease with this
so you see how I just like alright this
is a luxury eyeshadow people this is a
major hit I mean really a dollar I mean
that face think it could be better if
they look really cloudy through here
it's a learning process and these are
hit and miss products that we got to
remember so I'm going to do now is take
my NYC liquid liner now this is a runs
around two dollars they're kind of
quitting selling it in America which
sucks but I'm going to use it because I
really want to do liner I did get a
brace liner which we're going to try out
the purple on the lower lash line I'm
going to get a thirty brush from Sigma
and the chocolate color is a dark matte
Brown I'm just gonna pop it in the
crease just to define the crease a
little more
so I did find some $1 lashes easier
number 5 attend by Cara eyelashes I've
used to before and actually like to use
these a lot on her first on my channel
because they were a money-saving way of
doing makeup so we're going to use these
they are a little shaky looking and the
ban is super thin so really kind of like
long and too long for me
you know not living form but I won't put
them on anyway so we can like have this
moment together this $1 moment together
can the lashes have curled so much that
they won't stay on my eye so those did
not work out like they're literally
popping off my eye eye the bands so thin
like I could make them work really just
ruining the look honestly so I put them
on but or a child someone over up here
in the meantime this is called Framus
lash the one is super big and bold here
let's see what the mascaras got for it
the mascara is not doing anything for me
like kind of watery not really building
up or lifting the lashes so ok and this
smells so strong I a do not like it
I feel like it's about to my eyes start
watering I'm going to add a little bit
of cinnamon to the lower lash line now
I'm going to try out the liner this is a
great pencil liner hello cellphone I
went ahead and washed it um I'll shoot
dadgummit
it doesn't really come off you know you
can see a purple hue but not for rizal
no this is not good okay well last but
certainly not least I'm not putting that
mascara on my lower lashes because it's
just going to end up ruining the look
and I don't approve it so we'll move on
I'm going to add the Wonder metal liquid
lipstick this one is in oMG oh you know
this is not a color I wear every day
honestly they didn't have that made a
pic from actual product is probably one
of the most non streaky metal lippies
I've ever put on be so solid that is
dang
so the lychee like I said not living and
breathing for this color but in general
the actual lippy is not bad so I
approved the lippy I approve the
highlighter I approve the eyeshadows as
were fabulous
I disapprove the foundation the contour
kit was pretty decent this mascara stunk
the blush was like not for me the wand
on the concealer was a little bit of a
mess you know so we definitely have some
history definitely have some misses but
this was an interesting video and we
have way more hits than I thought we
would $1 make of it is I think makeups
all about experimenting and pushing
aside the price time just really getting
down to the nitty gritty because I've
tried out super expensive makeup as you
guys have seen on my channel and it
really didn't work out for me at all so
it's not always about price time
honey-bunny
more so about the performance of the
product that is it for today's video
what what do you guys think about the $1
makeup this is kiss proof - this is
prettier than a lot of high-end
metallics anyways that is it for this
look thank you guys so much for being
here and watching I hope you enjoyed the
video it was fun to film it I love you
guys so much and I will see you all in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
