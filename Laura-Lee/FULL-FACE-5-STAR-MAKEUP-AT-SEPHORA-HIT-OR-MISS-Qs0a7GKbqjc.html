channel today's video is going to be me
testing out five-star rated makeup from
Sephora so I went on Sephora calm and
then I typed in specific errors of
makeup such as foundation powder
concealer etc and then I would go to the
top rated and so only the fiestar makeup
I pull actually had a lot of stuff and I
chose to pull a lot of stuff that I've
never tried before so you guys wouldn't
know my thoughts on the products yet
because I don't know my thoughts on a
lot of the products yet now this video
is definitely inspired by rachhloves I
think she created this video and I will
link her video down below she's the one
that inspired me to do this because I
saw on her channel and I thought what a
great idea
are they really five to our products are
they really worth it these necklaces are
supposed to be stackable but among the
struggle bus with them because they
don't want to thank know what to sing
think if you haven't already subscribed
to my channel be sure and subscribe and
become a lolli today come on in come
join the family No alright just keep
watching go ahead and jump into this
video and get started do you see when
talking about who I'm dealing with here
do you ever buy something online you're
like oh my god that's so cute in the
model and then you get it and it like
looks like this let's get started with
the video first I'm going to prime my
skin so I should zoom in first first
this product has five stars on it and
this is a new product from Smashbox this
is the photo finish primer primer primer
it's a primer plus a moisturizer ahead
Holl erotic acid in it I'm pretty
excited about that I'm really into
moisturizing my skin before I glanced
it's still like a gel moisturizer as of
right now kind of more liquidy but once
you do it on your skin it thickens up
just a little bit and feels like a gel
moisturizer I don't hate it so far let's
see how it wears the foundation so the
types our foundation is yet another one
that I've never tried out before I
didn't really steal it without Sephora I
felt like they were as before then they
weren't up before another backup Sephora
am I wrong
I don't know I feel like that's what
happened it is this one by the way is
the stay of a foundation plus concealer
has foundation in it
so the little press down and foundation
comes out right there and then in the
lid you get a little concealer the only
flaw I see see in this is that the
concealers the same shade as the
foundation and typically like my
concealer to be a little bit lighter
than my foundation but hey I had five
stars on it we're going to try it out
you know just like topping is kind of
weird yeah a little bit on my wife takes
brush and I am going to start applying
it kind of nervous about this one
it feels really cold on the skin I'm
actually going to use hue number seven
it feels like a gel foundation because
it's kind of creamy really heavy feeling
and feels heavier I'm not getting that
much coverage out of it seems to be like
a super unnatural foundation it looks
like really foundation you said makes
any sense
next we're going to go ahead and put the
concealer on that comes with it in the
cap that oh super creamy I don't think
it was going to be that creamy I'm going
to take my white 11 brush and just tap
it out I just applied to my face and I
can with my finger with my concealer let
me just be dead-ass with you right now
girl it does not have that much coverage
and it feels thick AF which is what I
typically don't like in a concealer I
mean I guess I was like a little bit of
coverage but not for real for real like
there's so much darkness up in here that
isn't mean cover may be real I don't
like either of these products like off
the bat and that's really quick
immediate judgment say it but that's
just how I'm feeling right now so we're
going to keep going with the video and
hopefully things are gonna get better
I'm going to add some my Born This Way
setting powder from toothpaste I've
absolutely been loving this stuff and it
is a 5 star rated product when I saw
that all like oh hallelujah praise the
Lord because girl we got to have a good
finishing powder so hopefully that will
help some of my makeup dilemma going on
right now I'm actually just going at 250
under I try to I get a little more
coverage to a little bit
and then I'll just sprinkle a little
around the face because I feel like that
foundation is so wet and heavy guys like
it feels like a cake on my face and now
the next product we're going to play
with it's five so I'm going to go ahead
and do my face okay is the YSL wife L
had a ma you guys are about to cry
you're about to sit down at home and cry
with me look at what I just did I just
clawed through this beautiful
masterpiece with my stupid thumb oh well
if that doesn't make you cringe II I
just don't know what does my say my
inside to a three brush this is our
bronzer I'm so sad right now I don't
want to use except that I destroyed it
kind of a soapy actually call bronzing
stones I'm gonna make oh one a no two
together they're bronzing stone
collection was sun star rated oh I've
never used this product so I did get
this product actually whenever I went on
the why so trip to Morocco but I never
got to eat around to using it and I
thought what a perfect time I use it
whenever I saw it as a five-star product
on the support website it is very
pigmented so you get the bang for your
buck it does feel very silky
tell me girls did it it's a pretty
bronzer you can't decide I'm going to
wisp away the rest of this powder and
we're going to move on this is it a 54
next up for blush the Marc Jacobs these
are the air blushes they've got five
star ratings now these are popular but
they're 42 dollars for blush it's a lot
for one blush and she chose a wisp your
brush back and forth to room to get
beautiful color I have use ISA for this
is king and kisses and this is an r3
brush is where they're like drape drape
the blush I'm just going to apply blush
I'm not going to drape the blush but
these are really pretty I'm not going to
lie I enjoy them I think you're super
pricey but I guess Marc Jacobs in
general is pretty pricey so that kind of
goes hand in hand it's no shock that it
spicy well she was dropped her while
jaysus $42 in the hall so the next
product I'm really excited to try out
and it got five stars of course or else
I wouldn't be using it and this vide
Laura this is the bronze artist heat
wave highlighter from from Estee Lauder
and oh and oh my gosh like girl I've
actually had this for a long time and
look at the packaging and I'm held off
on using it for whatever reason so here
goes I'm going to take my r-36
I don't want to mess it up love jazel
looks well around this get such a good
rating though you guys ready are you
strapped in at home hurry oh my god yes
oh my god girl what was she waiting for
I don't know I don't know why I waited
to use this oh okay well this is my new
everyday highlighter setting sprays you
guys know I like to set my face now like
Pat it down and do my whole judge these
settings ready got pop stars that I
haven't really tried out yet but I did
have it on hand is the meta fiying
setting spray from cover FX in this
green bottle which I was like covers
access to you oh looks like a straight
paint pan okay I'm gonna let you know I
live for the mister whenever the mister
doesn't do like a jet stream and just
stabs you in the face
this would annoy whenever it likes in
this the whole face I'm here all day for
it which that one missed the whole face
oh that was nice I'm gonna take this
brush I detect on the settings breaks I
find it sets on top of the hairs on the
face and you should really like for my
face to exhibit this so you guys I'm
still shook us about the highlight
pretty vulgar oh my gosh these extra
pillows get 5 stars a new brand free the
bird palace a new brand Sephora here is
one of them I'm really digging the
purpley one and then we have the snazzy
colorful one they have really cute
packaging I've never turn out any other
makeup before they did send me these
pallets so I felt very five stars and
again I just saw how perfect for the
video first because the colorful one
doesn't really have mini transition
shades I'm going to go in with Rhys
which is just like using natural brown
color visit e27
rush and I'm just going to kind of apply
this all over I have on down eyes shadow
primer so softening up the eyeshadow
primers discolor it's pretty it's just
like almost the same color to my skin so
you can't see it that much I'm going to
take unruffled right at this properly
shade and this is an m5 7/3 brush I'm
actually going to use this purplish
shade for my transition Jinora
I take my art 38 brush and grab a little
bit of nest egg which is a pretty dark
brown color but I'm going to keep this
color pretty low lay down these eye
shadows like as far as a matte so far
seem to be really pigmented I see how
they got by stars I mean they're really
nice I see shadows they're blending out
really soft now I'm going to take unveil
with the same brush which is this one of
my favorite like purpley matte colors
and these normally come off it's almost
a brown oh yeah it's so pretty
I'm just kind of focusing these mostly
on the outer corner of the eye so which
makes a montage of all the weird faces
that make during making makeup I mean
we'd be here for days I'm always a
blending and eye shadow why am I like
that I don't know gonna take a little
bit of a Paint Pot and place it down
I'm debating which color I want to put
on the eyelids it's like an air doesn't
pink and this is kind of an iridescent
purple I think I'm going to do the
purple shade right here it's called true
colors this is the m45 brush I'm
actually going to take a little bit of
chirp and add it on top of that because
I think it needs a little more luster
than what we got and they're pigmented
so I like them I approve the palace
they're nice I'm gonna take just a
little bit more of unveil and really
smoke out that outer corner make sure
that harsh line I created is done I'm
going to add some winged liner and I'll
be right at it my liner and we're going
to move on to mascara the five star
mascara this one be only five star
mascaras is this gifted mascara from
Tarte and I like the fact you're a lot
my favorite are mascara it's a one in
the purple tube this one's good as well
terming some pretty gnarly mascaras I
just find it likes guitar mascara to
build up really well no I like mascara
that builds I'm normally like fighting
my lashes to stay up I will add salt
washes but you guys know I'll just
scream if I don't have them now the
liner they got it five stars is the Marc
Jacobs eyeliner and I have to actually
use the purple one but up to 100% agree
with that these are the best eyeliners
oh they last all day even in the
waterline this is grapevine that I'm
going to be using today there are a lot
of lip products I got 5 stars the only
malice of lipstick that got 5 stars with
me makeup forever
I like these they are very long wearing
they do stay intact your lips and
they're not too drying the only thing I
find about these because they're a
little in-between like really long
wearing but not too drying and I find
they get like it then today they get
like really goopy throughout here so you
just have to kind of fix that lash keep
up with it and make sure it's not
getting weird-looking on you I'm going
to do 105 symmetric so I look a little
bit better
this is the final look I pretty much was
obsessed with everything for the most
part except for the foundation and the
concealer just being like honest I don't
think my skin looks that good like I
finally it looks like a really make up
Ian super cakey like the foundation and
then it's kind of patchy I don't know I
just
it feels really heavy too which I'm not
so much used to I like more pigment and
foundation and less weight out of the
foundation understand when I was 5 stars
everything else was really really nice
even the eyeshadows which I'm glad about
because my first try Tessa that's my
first time trying any pretty vulgar
products so yeah thank you guys so much
for being here and watching I love you
guys to death and I hope you subscribe
