hey guys what's up welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be a first
impressions makeup tutorial
making everything a song I have gotten
in so much new makeup and it needs to be
tested out including these brushes and
like mermaid this thing go this thing
this thing got all kinds of stuff that
have come in and I haven't done first
impressions
hi and makeup tutorial in a while I did
a drugstore one not too too long ago but
some of these products like gimmicks to
me and we gotta get to the bottom of it
so I'm gonna be testing them out in
today's video and we're gonna see what's
the T on them I'm excited for today's
video I say that in every video but I
promise I don't feel nothing that I'm
not excited about filming so I'm always
excited up in here anywho we're gonna
sing the SUBSCRIBE song and then we're
gonna jump right into the video and if
you are not into the subscribe song
girls you gotta do a skip through about
three or four seconds then you can just
keep rolling with the video subscribe to
my channel before you leave
okay and now we're gonna go ahead and
jump right into today's video
not that anyone cares this on my face
it's gone down a lot but it feels like a
rock in my skin like hard as a rock
it's not sore and it came up overnight
cyst normally don't come up like
overnight and if they do they're
normally super inflamed and painful
this one isn't we thought it was a bug
bite but it doesn't itch I'm calling it
is it I've never had to sit right here
and I've never eyes it felt that hard
okay we need to get into the video Laura
I have to chew it up first product I
have to try out is this pure shake and
boost powder to cream multivitamin
booster so it's kind of like a skin prep
we're supposed to be really good for
your skin I'm gonna go ahead and set up
this mirror right here it isn't from
impressions vanity every time I share
this Miren people asked me where it's
from this is what the product looks like
and it comes with this little pooter cap
right there and so I'm gonna shake some
out on my hand
oh it just like falls out okay so I feel
like I should just oh oh it turns to
cream okay so what do you do do you just
like and just rub it okay hmm let me try
this side before I say anything you know
what that looks like I like how the
powder to cream rubs in so well my face
doesn't fill anything spectacular I
don't hate the product I don't know what
all its gonna do for me but you know
it's okay it's okay
feels kind of it feels very heavy on the
skin actually and like uh tacky kinda so
again I don't hate it but it's kind of
weird I did like how the powder to cream
blend it out but I don't love it ex
product I have to test out is this
shameless foundation youthful look
24-hour foundation from Marc Jacobs whoo
that's pink I have this shade here at
3:20 I out of the shade three hundred
three hundred it's a bit more neutral oh
you sell different these are it's kind
of hard to pick the shade yeah I'm gonna
mix them together and see mixing them
seemed to brought a good shade for me I
think it might be a little light but I'm
one of those people always thinks their
foundation shade is super light and it's
like girl that's your color you are not
that tan and I always think I have a tan
when I haven't seen the Sun and like
weeks I blend this out with my y6 brush
from morphe as you guys know this is my
favorite foundation brush but some
people are new here and they don't know
that and they need to be enlightened I
need to go read and see what the
spectacular Ness on this foundation is
because I just rubbed out my skin and
you can see every thing even the redness
in my unibrow those medium coverage is
for normal to dry skin so basically
people are saying if you have oily skin
on the reviews of it it says it's a
medium coverage foundation for a drive
it come and maybe combination skin and
people are saying you have oily skin
avoided on the reviews I think it's a
light coverage foundation just my first
impressions like I can literally see
everything right through it I'm gonna
try to add a little bit more to see if
it is buildable because we go we don't
knows I'm a full coverage kind of girl
but you know that doesn't mean the
foundation is bad just cuz it's not full
coverage but it just feel like it's
super sheer super like heavy and shiny
like really heavy feeling on the skin
I'm gonna be honest like I don't love
the foundation so far next I'm gonna
move on and try out the flawless fusion
longwear concealer from Laura Mercier I
really love Laura Mercier face products
I haven't tried this one yet oh come on
coverage whoa I mean it's a rarity that
her face products let me down so I'm
excited to try this out I've actually
been holding it off I'm like wait film
with it don't use it without your
lollies
so as you guys know I normally buff out
my concealer with the white six brush as
well and so far the concealer does feel
heavy but gosh the coverage is nice okay
so far the concealer um I like I like
the consistency of it so for setting
powder I have this under-eye brightening
setting powder from Becca I've never
tried this one before and I'm excited to
see how it turns out filling it just
feels like one of those silky super
flash backe powders but let's give it a
go cuz I haven't tested out a new
setting powder girl once I got a good
setting powder it's hard for me to
switch up
creases bring it around so this is
supposed to set specifically the under
eye and be brightening so anyone else go
crazy with setting powder you're just
like start with a little under your eye
it's like okay we're just gonna set the
whole thing
I feel super silky but I felt like the
setting powder was instead of moreso
brightening I felt like it was just more
so translucent therefore setting the
product but not actually brightening my
under eyes I feel like the cover FX and
Laura Mercier one are a little bit
thicker and have a little bit more of a
color consistency to it so it actually
brightens the skin I'm about to take a
picture of my face with the flash and I
swear this has splash back I'm gonna
fight myself in the mirror I'm sorry she
is white honey oh you guys see that like
the flash back I cannot my undereyes the
flash back uh-uh honey honey
uh-uh so you know I think it set the
makeup well I don't think it brightened
in InTouch flashback next up I have this
bronze palette from Hoda Beauty this is
her new highlighter palette but it's
called the bronze sand Edition so it has
lots of pretty shimmery bronzer shades I
think this highlighter could potentially
work for me and like that blush color
could work for me I want to travel with
these new tart mermaid brushes the girl
they got a mermaid collection we're
gonna be diving more into in just a
second so keep hanging with me but I
don't feel like I need to keep going
into detail about how I feel about
unicorns and mermaids
I'm gonna dip it into the bronzer
my bronzers just not for me and that's
just what it is and it's way more
pigmented than I thought
it is obviously too dark for me that's
totally fine I guess I underestimated it
looking at it in the palette but it is
blending out really nice like the
quality of it is so pigmented and it's
like see I just used a tiny tiny a bit
on this more fluffy brush and it's not
so bad so I go in with my efore brush
and bora-bora which is the more blush
shade and try that out on my cheek and
bora-bora is really pretty and it is a
deeper blush like I said but you just
have to use less of it this is the
prismatic palette from Kevin a Quan I do
like the brand but these like looking at
them in the palette just look chunky how
bumpy and chunky they kind of look so
this is like prismatic it's called a
highlighter palette I'm gonna take my
r-36 which this is the highlighter brush
I always use illusion I can't decide
this is more like chunks of glitter
Sparkle rather than an actual like
creamy illuminator
I know what I suspected looking at it oh
Jesus
we're going to Coachella or something
this could be really cute and like a
moment but I just feel like every day
like this is not what I look for in a
highlighter not my cup of tea but like I
said if you're going to an event or had
something fun to go to you really could
use this I'm not trying to say like oh
it's bad cause it's chunky MSA girl it's
just not something I'll be using hmmm we
are not having that good of luck today
here is the Tarte mermaid palette it is
like a cock a clamshell a conch shell
it's like what the little mermaid popped
out of and then you get a nice mirror
and then you get these shades overall it
is a pretty palette like it's
aesthetically pleasing and it definitely
looks like a mermaid palette so I think
that's really cool and it has some nice
shimmers and mattes in it here are a few
swatches like I said the pigment and
quality and the shades feel pretty nice
let me tell y'all some tea you can never
have enough Neutrogena makeup remover
wipes I feel like a couple of the shades
look I did
whole to one another and I feel like
they could have had more fun with that
but that again it's just a personal
preference I'm gonna grab this shade on
it in five seven three brush Jane it's
actually called sure thing and I'm gonna
blend that right there in the crease and
we're gonna use this shade as a
transition I'm gonna take our 39 in
shipwright I'm gonna put shipwreck on
the outer corner of the eye with the
smaller blender brush I kind of sort of
feel like these colors I'm not gonna lie
are a little bit dry and dusty as far as
the matte but the shimmers feel really
soft and creamy I'm gonna apply bubbles
on it m41
I'm gonna put it on my lid
I do like this shimmers I feel like
again it's just the mats and the palette
that aren't like blending that nice they
feel kind of dry I'm gonna take a
sandbar on a pencil brush and just as I
was doing already buff it like all the
way across my pencil brush I'm gonna
grab splash across the lower lash line
next up I'm going to apply at BADgal
bang this is the new mascara from
benefit and I've already tried it out so
I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys
like a rundown on my fillings torch it I
do like the mascara the only downfall I
feel about it is that it's a very wet
mascara so it does take longer than
normal to dry so if you're applying
false lashes on top of it you're gonna
have to wait a minute for it to dry like
I'm going to have to today but this is
probably the best mascara I've ever used
in my whole entire life on my bottom
lashes it snatches those suckers like
there's no tomorrow
so I definitely recommend it for your
bottom lashes girl I'm gonna take nude
beach which is this light top shade and
apply this to my inner corners Tarte is
also coming out with mermaid eyelashes I
have no idea what the heck this is gonna
look like on me but in honor of our
person person's video this is my new
lash I feel like I should do definitely
do like a winged liner though because I
feel like that band is definitely going
to show
please our lashes are kind of cool maybe
for like a moment like again a Coachella
moment can I hate how my face makeups
looking though except at dark bronzer
chunky glitter my foundation is not full
coverage okay next up I have some these
new glosses from Urban Decay their high
shine glosses and while we're on the
mermaids streak we might as well try it
out the shade snapped it's like this
crazy blue iridescent smells like mint
it is pretty but I feel like these blue
arrow dessins kind of make your lips
look dirty or the edges like dirt runmel
next I'm gonna try midnight cowgirl it's
more of a nude shade I like that better
okay let me give you a rundown on what I
think the lashes actually after all
whenever you blink and look down it
looks like there's a shadow that fell
down on the lashes so I'm gonna go ahead
and say no the crazy blue lip color it
ain't for me it makes my lips look dirty
I don't like it I let her palette it's
too chunky you know I want from me the
hoodie Beauty bronze palette I did like
it it is a deeper palette it's very
pretty I shoulda palette honestly I like
this palette I'm a little over mermaids
and unicorns
I feel like the Mattress were not good
like at all I didn't like them setting
powder I didn't like until er I did like
the concealer actually that was really
nice I basically put it out there a lot
of things didn't work out for me in this
first impression but also with this
first impressions there was a lot of
different products so little gimmicky
