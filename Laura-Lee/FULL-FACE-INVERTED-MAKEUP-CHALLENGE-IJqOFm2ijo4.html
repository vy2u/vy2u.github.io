reverse make it challenge it's been well
besides me my husband do my drag makeup
which that really wasn't a challenge
video but it's been a long time since we
have had some fun on this channel and
just did a fun video for shits and
giggles just to laugh a little so I
wanted to do with the reverse makeup
challenge video it's been going around
on YouTube and also I'm going to link
down below in my description box a
couple of my favorite versions of this
video so many people have done it and
some have just made me laugh so friggin
hard and so I'm gonna link them down
below and also maybe it's a chance for
people to grow their channels and for
you guys to discover other really
amazing youtubers that I love so much
it's like hilarious so basically leave
my winged liner goes this way my eyebrow
starts right here my contours here my
highlights here you get what I'm saying
like it's hilarious okay I promise
you're gonna laugh a little because I
think I'm gonna laugh through the whole
video I don't even know how about to do
this to be for real like I don't it
scares me but we're supposed to
challenge yourself because nothing good
comes from the comfort zone I'll go
ahead and jump right into the video
well I already have foundation on as you
guys can see there's no shocker there I
think we should start with our eyes cuz
that's gonna be funny she was driving
their eyes let's start with their eyes I
feel like I'm gonna look like a hot mess
of course I'm gonna use my baby child
you guys want lots of looks out of it so
this will be one to remember I don't
even have an eye primer on like I'm
trying to sabotage my own look right now
I need to get it together let me put a
little bit of my patent pick on top okay
oh now I'm gonna take okie dokie and
just blend it all over just to soften
the primer me don't really follow
through this makeup look if you wanted
to but just reverse what I do and do it
yourself
this has got to be so weird for me I
just can't get over by my hey bomb
diggity this palette is dirty by the way
this is like my baby palette that I've
been using on top I'm just going let's
see yeah I normally focus it on the
outer corner and then blend inward so
we're gonna we're gonna do the opposite
see I can't help myself I can't help
that oh my god this is art okay here we
go and then just taper out the rest
things just aren't right right now for
me is art you guys we do down every
video Laura I'm gonna hate that fluffy
brush and just soften that up I'm going
to take cray cray next which is our
warmer Brown with the same brush whether
this is an m5 1:9 I'm screaming on the
inside we're just really gonna work it
in that inner corner gonna make this
look look good I'm telling you what if
this becomes a trend I already look like
I'm on the cover of those like like very
avant-garde soften up the edges it's
kind of hard to blend with my big old
nose in the way just like I'm gonna go
in with the shade out the other actually
you use in r39
a little bit of a smaller brush the
reason I'm not gonna do like a halo
smokey eye or anything because that
would turn out not really inverse it
would turn out pretty normal so I'm
gonna do maybe I'll be like a cut crease
or like something with a shimmer would
normally go in the inner corner if that
makes sense I keep trying to make it
look really smooth and pretty but it
just it's weird I'm gonna take some
paint pot like this is about to get hard
okay cuz normally I do this all the time
my videos where I carve out like I don't
know where to start begin I carve out
the inner corner after I've blended out
a bunch of
this is not that easy you slight
difficulties it looks like it could be
pretty ok optimism optimism is key I'm
gonna take ridiculous I'm a finger uh do
you see that I tried that on my inner
corner I can't help it you can't teach
an old dog new tricks up backwards I'm
gonna take a little bit of oddball stood
deep in the outer corner in our corner
excuse me uh I just feel like things are
going so I'm feeling odd right now and I
feel like I made a mess of my eyes I'm
not a great experience
backwards makeup artist I'm more of a
like forward makeup artist you know
where you do it pretty normal I don't
know maybe I need to work harder on my
inverse reversible makeup skills we're
gonna move on we're gonna move on with
our life and get over it we're gonna put
on a little bit of gel liner I'm gonna
use this one from a pretty vulgar it
like comes in this old ink container
thing and we're gonna try out some weak
liner backwards winged liner this should
be really easy guys don't know where to
start how do you do a wing in the inner
corner it's the real question oh my God
look at this wing it's a little janky
but we'll keep going
that is not that great of a wing okay
that is that's a swing at it you know I
took a swing I don't know why but to me
this literally it just looks like it
hurts like and now you can really tell
that my wings run even this is really
bad I'm not proud of this wing liner but
times are hard okay I'm gonna add some
mascara and no actually I'm not I'm
gonna put on eyebrows and we're gonna
all laugh together so let's figure out
how to do a reverse eyebrow I'm gonna
take my precisely my brow pencil by
benefit and shade number four and I'm
gonna figure this out all I need to do
is to start my brows off normal like
that's all I evenly know how to do all
right here's the front of the brow ready
we'll comb that out and make it look
better I hope oh my god I just I
understand how to make this area that's
already bushy like how do I make that
thin comb that brow girl yeah that's the
worst ever I've ever seen well I see
that's supposed to be pointing but then
I have all these hairs maybe we gel the
hairs down I'm not that proud of this
eyebrow and I don't want you guys to
follow what I've done here this is also
a train wreck okay eyebrows are on let's
go ahead and contour are you guys ready
to really start screaming I'm gonna take
my quake-stricken quick trick stick from
Mac I'm not gonna sabotage my face right
now
with this right here oh yeah uh-huh oh
my god like I hate myself right now I
feel like I look like that woman
oh so long I'll try and think yeah like
a highlight here I'm gonna take my wire
sail all ours concealer and I'm going to
contour my face has cheekbones
oh that just feels so wrong I look
insane I think it's the eyeliner and
brows is doing it to me not the insane
contour and highlight now I'm gonna
blend this out I'm going to blend out
I'm gonna wash this brush now but all
this contour I don't know what to think
I have like no commentary to say about
it just cuz like I literally don't know
what to think put on way too much
concealer on my nose so that's gonna be
great I'm gonna take this 3d kabuki
brush and tap out that gorgeous contour
yes contour like should I go out in
public and just be like hi like a
completely normal person I mean makeup
is creativity and I am allowed to do
whatever the hell I want with it so what
are you looking at this is not my
proudest YouTube moment but it might be
very funny is oh my there's just so much
happening on my nose like I messed up I
put on too much product okay I messed up
my face is currently asking what did it
do to deserve this so I'm going to now
put on it a little bit of powder why I
don't know to complete the video I guess
to be fair and do the good video you
know make it good I'm gonna take it yet
49 and I'm actually gonna apply powder
where we contoured since yeah that's
right am i wait what bake the areas that
don't really need to be baked I'm gonna
take a brush and just buff the rest away
oh my god this is just so bad like I
hate my face today oh I'm gonna add some
lashes so I decided to pick lashes that
go like bigger on the outer corner
smaller on the inner corner that way we
could invert them and really tell a
difference let me pop on some mascara
and I'll be buck while my lashes are
drying we need some bronzer so I'm gonna
take this makeup heat bronzer it's
called sunkissed and I'm just gonna set
the contour looks a little sunburned
oh wait no that goes in the middle of my
nose I can't I cannot remember how to do
it reverse I keep wanting to put it
where he goes I can't help it okay I'm
going to apply the lashes tie what do
you think oh good you should actually
hurt his genuine reaction but we weren't
recording he literally freaked out
because he forgot I was filming this
didn't you he's like oh that's what
they're saying at home too they're
literally like what is wrong with her
alright I'm gonna take the cray-cray
color and normally I start on the outer
corner with the under eye but I'm gonna
start on the inner corner I mean I will
I won't I probably won't I'm bluffing
right now you call my bluff I don't know
why I'm trying to like soften this and
make it look so good whenever this is
just a lost cause now for highlight
we're gonna use a little bit of the dose
of colors Fuego which is Katie and
desease collaboration I really like this
highlight and we would normally put at
the top of the cheekbone but we're just
gonna put it like in that genre you see
me flying in and then we'll put it on
the side so now is how disgusting
on the sides of the nose instead of them
thinner look at that shiny nose so
pretty I'm trying to hold that busting
out laughing oh I'm gonna take a white
four and the flower of beauty of blush I
don't know where to put it I guess I'll
just put it here or would you guys put
if you were doing it invert it now it
looks like I have a rash lastly for lips
I think we should go with a bold color
just to get our laughs out and I'm gonna
use bloodshot from morphe this is the
liquid lipstick and I'm just gonna apply
it the best that I can in the most
inverted way that I possibly can Oh
whenever you overdraw your lips just a
little bit no one will ever notice right
well guys this is it I heard about have
to do therefore apparently my Copley up
that wasn't me before lip fillers what
are you guys think let us do the slow-mo
role where we do the glamour shots ready
I don't know what I'm doing now okay I'm
just being weird that's it yeah okay we
did that uh yeah this is the final look
I hope you guys got a little laugh on
this video and didn't take it too
serious I never take myself too serious
clearly I love you guys thank you for
being here watching subscribe if I
didn't scare you away with this makeup
look and I'll see you in the next video
my bracelet is about to come off and
