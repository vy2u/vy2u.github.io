welcome to my hello hi hey guys what's
up and welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be me testing out a
low rated makeup from Sephora and this
video has been floating around YouTube
and I think it's a very interesting
concept I don't know who started it but
I've seen Nicole Concilio do it I seen
Kelly's track do it I've seen rachhloves
do it and those are just a couple
channels that I've seen do it so I don't
know who started it but I'm gonna take a
swing at it and I also found something
that I think is very very interesting at
Sephora like that goes on I think it's
very interesting the low rated products
are considered a three point something
because there's pretty much nothing
lower than that rated at Sephora and I
just I think that's such a weird system
and I think that's I think that's
strange because the highest is a 5 so
how is the worst product at Sephora in
the 3 so all these products around 3.5
3.6 rated and that's considered low
rated I don't know what their skill is
or how they're doing that and I also try
to find products that had a lot of
ratings on them I did in the past
highest rated product from Sephora in
the past but then I had picked some
items I didn't realize they only had
like two or three reviews on it so it
was like you know not a very good
representation of a high rated product
and that was my bad so this time I try
to pick items add a lot of reviews on it
and so I was surprised honestly I was
like wow really this has a bad review
because I've tried out some of these
products before and then some I was like
I can see that okay so I have a bunch of
products basically a full face pretty
much to test out of low rated products
and we're going to see her they really
low rated or are they actually worth
your dollar or are they right on point
also as you guys know I am doing
multiple giveaways in the month of

now let's go ahead and jump right into
the video
I also have like little notes on each
product that I don't want you to see
because I want to tell you okay the
first product is low rated and I found
this to be like one of the lowest rated
primers on the support website this is
the milk makeup blur stick is a primer
this is supposed to blur your skin so
this one got a three point six which is
kind of low
I'm Sephora as a site and you're
supposed to just rub it on the skin now
I think it does do a little bit of
blurring factor but nothing at dramatic
nothing like that's like real talk a lot
of people were complaining about the
hardness and I gotta agree just like
with stick products a lot of times they
tend to be hard as a brick and this is
indeed hard to break but you definitely
definitely feel it on your skin I don't
think it's a terrible primer but I don't
think it's like a miracle-worker primer
and I think people maybe thought it's a
blur sticks really interesting and it
just didn't turn out to do too much so
for foundations shockingly one of the
lowest rated foundations or and this one
has like five thousand ratings on it
it's like insane is the all-nighter by
urban decay you can tell I've used a bit
of this foundation and it's because I
actually like it
it's 7.0 is the shade I use and I had
myself found a really hard time finding
my shade in this my correct shade and
that just goes a lot of times with
really full coverage foundations I find
that because they're so thick it's hard
to get the exact shade which versus a
thinner foundation is easier to blend it
in even if it's not the exact shade you
definitely can't tell but with these you
can and so they're really hard to find
the right shade and like I get the low
rating but like I love the thickness of
it but I also - you go we got to cover
all these zits I - um you know I had a
hard time with the shade matches and it
does oxidize a bit so if you can see
that's the fresh swatch and now it's
already oxidized you see the color
difference I'm gonna take a
freshly-cleaned Wyatt 6 brush from
morphe I'm gonna blend all this in and
just Real Talk I don't think this
product looks that bad on my skin I mean
it does oxidize and you can kind of tell
like the difference so it's real tough
with the color matching so let's move
let's move on shall we next is the Too
Faced Born This Way concealer so this
item I thought was gonna be a hot topic
and really it never was and I went and
checked the ratings and it had a 3.6 and
I think the ratings is that way it's not
a bad concealer in my opinion it just
definitely is not full covers if you
really have darkness on the under eye
this is not your go-to like this is for
just a little bit of brightening and
maybe some moisture on the under eye
because it's a very moisturizing one in
my opinion but go as far as the coverage
just ain't there however if you can see
you can see my darkness kind of that
right through there right through this
concealer it just ain't the one I like
it like because it doesn't claim to be
like super full coverage I just because
it's not I don't typically go for it
like I don't typically like grab this
concealer and that's because I need a
little more coverage
okay the next product which kind of
shook me a little bit I couldn't believe
this had bad ratings it doesn't have
many ratings on it hello it doesn't have
many ratings on it but it does not have
good ratings what I found with this
setting powder is that younger people
thought it was too heavy and cakey and
kind of got into like the creases but I
found like more mature skin liked it a
little bit more it kind of targets more
mature skin and that's why younger
people don't obsess over it I like the
product but I get it like it's a thicker
powder and it's kind like a lot of
sunscreen in it so over time I'm wearing
it it does get a little bit cakey and a
little bit much but it's not a bad
powder I think it's great for mature
skin especially how's that well she's
gonna be super full coverage today honey
but it has that uh sunscreen in it 3.6
Realty is I didn't find a brow product
that was liberated which yeah if I
missed that comment down below and just
let a girl know sorry you done messed up
but the next product was interesting to
me that it was low rated and it's the
peach glow palette
like everything with the peach collected
every collection
everybody loved so much and then I saw
this and it got to a what is my to get a
three point five which is pretty
relatively low for Sephora and a lot of
people are complaining that it didn't
have any pigment to the colors I've used
this before and I agree 100% honestly it
smells like peaches it's one of the
cutest pallets they've ever come out
with but the actual quality of the
product just isn't there I definitely
thought it was a bit floppy it so what
I'm gonna do is use the blush and the
highlight real quick and then I'm gonna
contour it a little bit so you can like
dabble it's just so pressed in there
like honestly just as me digging and
product it's like nothing comes off it's
insane I guess them trying to put the
imprint of the peaches on there or
something created a mess so this let's
see I've gone over it like a bazillion
times really trying to work that in and
it's such it's like nothing dude on the
nose it's such a subtle highlight and
honestly that's muth me like really
getting in there the benefit holistic it
got a okay rating I wanted to find a
contour product to talk about today and
this one got you know a three point
seven which isn't terrible but honestly
I get it with this product a couple of
my friends on YouTube didn't like this
product I kind of liked it and hear me
out I thought this product was good for
beginners because it blends out really
easy but it blends out into almost
nothing like there's not a lot of
pigment on it so like I get both sides
of the story I just feel like whenever
you're a beginner at contouring like if
there's so much pigment I just pull a
long hair out of my eyeball but whenever
you're beginning at contouring and
there's so much pigment to blend out I
find that it gets messy and it's really
hard to work with where it says product
not that much pigment comes out so it's
a little easier but if you're a master
at it and you use this you're gonna be
like
so I get both sides of the party I'm
gonna take a morphe and four three six a
little stipler and blend this out do you
see how it's like so subtle it's like
not much of anything also blends out
just so easy you see a little you see a
little contour nothing major
I'm gonna take my m5a1 brush and go into
this bronzer remind you this bronzer is
light AF so yeah I just honestly it's
like slightly patchy as well this
palette I don't recommend it I agree I
mean it's it's kind of sloppy okay let's
move on to the eyes so there were quite
a few palettes that had low ratings
glitter-bombed by Too Faced had really
low ratings
um this Victoria Beckham was one of the
lowest raised products on the site
I think this palettes around seventy
five freaking dollars and he got a two
point nine people said I mean seventy
five bucks for this mini eyeshadows and
they said the quality was bad by a baby
I've had this palette I haven't really
tried it out I tried have this palette
this is the artist number three palette
and I got a three point six which is
definitely not the end of the world
people just did not like the quality of
the eyeshadows and his random AF the
shades in the palette like I don't even
know there's like a yellow matte and the
rest are shimmers and then same oh
there's like a gray and then shimmers in
the Victoria Beckham so it's like just a
mess of colors oddly enough I'm gonna
take that shimmery yellow and I'm gonna
use that as my transition shade today
and I get it like these shadows I'm
diggin in and if you can see you can
barely see any yellow on my eye I get it
like there's not much pigment to these
and they're artists shadows are
typically good I'm gonna take the
lightest shade right here and just hit
the brow bone with it as well try to get
like a little pop looks kind of chalky
don't you guys think what do you guys
think just to play around and see what
the T is I'm gonna try out this
cranberry shade which is shimmery it's
kind of hard to blend I'm not gonna lie
it's a little bit patchy so hard to
blend out I am using my favorite blender
brush I feel like it's like the color is
a little darker than what's in the
palette once you get it on your eye like
that's just not pretty you know and this
is like a satin matte kind of matte with
glitter in it it's not really shimmer
the more I use it I mean I agree like
this definitely is not worth $75 there
are a lot of good pieces to this
collection with Victoria Beckham but
this honey is just not one of them I'm
going with the pink shade in the center
this actually has a lot of pigment those
pink shades pretty oh yeah lots of
pigment so I guess these shadows are
more so hit and miss in this palette
because this one's pretty and I haven't
even hit it with mac fix+
I want to tap into some of this darker
purple just to play like we just play in
now deepen it up this one's kind of
creamy very pigmented it's coming off a
lock like it almost looks black oh Jesus
your friend may have gotten too much eye
shadow I'm Irish
okay believe it or not next up for
mascara oh I actually have an eyeliner
they got a pretty low rating it is by
Tarte
we got the clay paint eyeliner it got a
3.7 and you know people really thought
it um it's kind of hard to work with and
I remember this product is really
popular whenever it first came out and
it was always sold out and this came out
a while ago and I wasn't on tarsier list
and I tried to get it so bad it was
always sold out and I finally got my
hands on it and to be honest I didn't
really love it I felt like it farted in
my face it is shot Oh what does Abaddon
squeeze into it it's gonna have to dry
and I'm gonna have to scrape it off so
that's gonna be on my face for a minute
and we'll just pretend that it's not I'm
embarrassed
okay I got some pretty thick wings on
you know it's not the worst liner in the
world but it's definitely not my
favorites and not one that I reach for
typically so for mascara surprisingly
sits the Too Faced Born This Way is like
them they are better than sex it's like
the number one mascara in America I
figured this one would have high ratings
and it did not this one got a 3.0 which
is pretty low which rhymes and it also
had over 2000 reviews and a lot of
people either said it wasn't waterproof
or it was too chunky and flaky but most
people saying it wasn't waterproof and I
also saw one review where someone was
saying it ripped out the real lashes
which scares me as to why I'm putting it
on my right now 100 that's just the
price of main and beauty table I think
this one definitely is a chunkier
formula than the other original one and
I also think that it sucks and
waterproof mascaras like you have to buy
like the two-faced remover to remove it
that's just crazy like expensive to get
all that I mean one person even said
like on their wedding day like I ran and
smudge so that sucks really bad I'm
gonna take this little Estee Lauder
white shade it's like really flaky but
it does show up it's like glitter to be
honest okay and for lips the tooth I
know a lot of this to face sorry guys
two-face just had a lot of bad ratings
on Sephora so I was like but anyways
this is the Too Faced liquid latex now
I've already reviewed these on my
channel and they don't make any claim
they they make a claim they kind of are
what they claim to be if that makes
sense they are a really sticky gooey
shiny gloss it looks like liquid latex
on your lips they have a really low
rating they have a 3.5 and they are on
clearance right now so it looks like
they're trying to get rid of them I'm
gonna try out I have a neutral shade in
a purple shade I'm gonna try them both
out this is Twilight Zone it's literally
glue ahh
lots of pigment though I personally
won't go for this at all ever
I don't like super sticky things on
ever I can't stand it actually so I
typically won't use these but the only
reason I gave it a decent review in the
past is because they are what they claim
to be but yeah that is it for this video
guys let me try on let me try on the
other in the nude shade just so you can
get a variety of low-rated products this
one is hopeless romantic it's pretty
just sticky AF honey baby doll that is
it for this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it I definitely think my makeup
looks a little heavy and a little bit
gross and muddy um and I think the
eyeliner is okay you know I just think
it's a little weird to apply with the
tube and it also fart in my face felt
like but what piece aren't for me I mean
you guys tell the video you know the tea
a lot of it is accurate in the reviews
and I definitely recommend reading views
never ever I can recommend leaving
honest reviews on sephora.com so people
know the no no honey be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
well you can enjoy the giveaway becoming
lauralee today and I will see you all in
my next video bye guys
smells like nothing I don't know why I
thought it would smell like a poot
