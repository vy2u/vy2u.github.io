vlog channel it's really funny I hope it
will have food in my teeth literally a
whole chicken nugget was in my tooth hey
guys what's up welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be underrated
affordable makeup now I know this topic
is very specific I don't really know why
it's so specific I know I was leading up
to an explanation but I don't have one
and today's video I'm gonna be sharing
with you a bunch of products that I
think are so amazing but like they
aren't hyped up online people don't
really talk about you may have heard of
the brands before but the specific
products from the brand I don't know
that you've heard of and I need to make
sure that you've heard of them because
it's kind of my duty at the Beauty
around a lot you know I don't really
have much tea for you guys today the tea
is like not piping it's like lukewarm
today we're gonna talk about makeup that
is a forkball I love when people hate
when I snap because then they quickly
realize they're on the one channel and
they're right Laura Lee's alright today
I'm going to insert a subscriber singing
the SUBSCRIBE song and then we'll jump
right in
good job my friend
alright let's get started
party going this way my desk is such a
mess right now I don't even know how I'm
gonna film this video okay let's do this
I need to get started start it Oh
in this video let me get it together I
got my boxycharm and I never talked
about boxing on my youtube channel I
mostly talked about it on my Instagram
but today we're gonna be talking about
on my youtube channel I have partnered
with boxycharm to talk about this box in
this video and actually the box is what
inspired the whole entire video because
box of charm I've like found they have a
lot of popular brands in him and also I
found a lot of underrated makeup if you
don't know what boxycharm is it's a $21
a month subscription box you can cancel
anytime
you get five full-size or deluxe sized
samples and it most of the products are
always full size find out about brands
I've never heard of before all the time
and really good products in it all the
time I research like kind of how I built
up my makeup collection whenever I was
starting out on YouTube if you divide
the products in this box the five
products by 21 bucks
how do math got my
huh four bucks a product bucks around a
full time size product so it was like me
adding five products my makeup
collection every month for $21 I'm gonna
show you the products in it we're gonna
use them in today's tutorial
especially this palette right here
because I'm real excited about it so
this is a June boxycharm you guys did
not know this palette came in it how
pretty is she oh the brand had actually
sent me this palette beforehand and it's
a really nice quality but I just got a
fresh one in this boxycharm I got three
full-size Lexi brushes I got a full-size
Oprah liquid lipstick in Veronica I got
a full-size eyeliner in the shade
charcoal and I got a pair of faux faux
lashes ever you sign up for marks each
time you take a little quiz and tell
about like what you like about your skin
tone and things like that so that kind
of depends on what you get most a lot of
the boxes are the same stuff and then I
got a deluxe size sample of my favorite
moisturizer ever this is the Brazilian
bum cream they sell us at Sephora it is
amazing and it smells like well I think
I really didn't have was like an
underrated facial primer I mean I have a
lot of a good affordable ones my
favorite one is my ELF that's affordable
but I've talked about so much I don't
really know that it's like underrated I
don't always feel like it always always
always need a facial primer if my skin
is really nice and moisturized one of my
favorite recent foundation says come out
is this makeup revolution one and I
don't really see that many people using
it already did like a review on it and
it worked so well on my skin even I
don't wear it enough and it's very
affordable I use the shade f10 errata
let's just color on her face has a
really nice coverage too by the way and
I live a full coverage so I'm gonna be
using my wonderful wife six brush from
Offutt and you guys know what to do okay
so I'm blending this out yes good and
you can see like that Big Red's it boom
gone such amazing oh wait the Reds it
was over here gone though so so so so
good coverage what I like to do is
really stipple the product in and then
to kind of rub it in as well until I get
like this airbrushed finish they look
how pretty this foundation looks it
looks like a high-end foundation and I
don't know I see a lot of people talk
about the wet and wild and the Milani
and the ones like that that are
affordable but not really the makeup
revolution and it's so good I have seen
a lot of UK beauty bloggers talk about
this more so than us beauty bloggers
okay for a concealer talked he actually
turned me on to this one this is the
kooky cosmetics be bright eliminated
concealer in golden tan I don't know why
says golden tan it's a really good
concealer it wears very nicely it
reminds me slightly of the NYX HD
concealer which is not underrated that's
a very hyped up but this one isn't
I think houki is sold at I'm gonna
correct me and tell me don't don't dump
stares someone tell me I'm gonna blend
it out with a brush that I created with
morphe this is a really it's like this
mini kabuki with a dome shape so it's
really good for the under eye and I just
like to stipple this product out and if
you can see this concealer it covers so
well it's a really great and it's one of
my favorite products from kookie I am a
full coverage Queen or a setting powder
now most the time when I do affordable
or like full face affordable product
video I always lean on this setting
powder from NYC and it ain't just cheap
girly real cheap never you hear about
drugstore setting powders you always
hear about the Maybelline one or the
Aspen Cody I just dumped half of it out
you guys even see me oh my god is a
Sahara Desert in here just gonna take a
blender and really set her under-eye
this is the only baking I do
that's brownies at 3 a.m. and then I
binge eat the whole entire pan and cry
myself to sleep at night so she's bacon
at 4000 degrees that's right and I'm
just gonna take this big flat top brush
this isn't eat at 54 and I'm just gonna
dust away base I really looks so silky
smooth besides my zit and it just looks
so full coverage and even and these
products are really good I'm telling you
I'm telling you
lotty a face pellet that I really loved
it's affordable is this one by essence
beauty you get a blush a powder and a
bronzer but my favorite thing in it is
the bronzer so what I'm gonna do is take
an art 14 brush brush I like the color
of the bronzer it's almost a dupe for
hoola by benefit I'm gonna contour out
it's pretty silky smooth I gotta say
this bronzer if you guys can see it just
blends effortlessly it gives my skin
like just enough color this is awesome I
definitely recommend it to you and I'm
actually gonna go ahead and use the
blush from the palette as well this is
an e for blush brush and this is such a
pigmented blush but I find it it blends
out really easy which is very important
whenever the blush is too pigmented or
like has so much pigment but it doesn't
blend I might get it the hell away from
me
alright this is like one of the most
exciting products that I'm accepting
most exciting products that most excited
to talk about the new la girl luminous
glow or it's newer
this they're loose highlighters this is
my favorite room wand they have a few
different shades but sunkissed it's like
a pinky gold undertone duo prompt one
let me show you I'm talking about
actually gonna use one my Luxy brushes
from the boxycharm here are what the
three brushes looked like got a 5:16 at
five to two and a six60 but I'm gonna
take the five to two because I'm using a
loose powder I think this would be a
nice brush to use I mean are you kidding
me like I barely put any on I swear I
just dust it a little bit and then what
I love about it is that it doesn't leave
a weird cast on my face for wreaking
pretty and I'm gonna go ahead and bring
it around the forehead and then we're
gonna put a little bit on our Cupid's
bow on our chin we're just gonna bathe
our whole body in it because that's all
I know to do another product from la
girl that I think is great
and underrated is their new brow gel so
this one is in soft brown and it's kind
of a dupe for dip brow it's really nice
and it's a lot less in price so the
brand la girl like overall it's like
magnificent and the prices are pretty
darn low
don't let that Brown looks and it was
such an affordable product I used so
we're gonna do this guy right over here
oh she's looking good ex I really want
to use this palette it is so pretty and
I want to swatch these shades because
they're like wet filling elbows and then
watch are you kidding me girl you guys
just saw me alive swatch them one time
down the hand and I mean seriously is
this a joke it's not a joke this is not
a drill our pants not a drill this
palettes so nice so I'm gonna take some
that NYC powder and just set my primer
because if we don't we're just gonna
have a sticky mess on our hands
hey more Dylan just get it first I want
to go into Koko taxi and then tropica
I'm gonna use an r 39 brush first
tapping into Koko taxi alright here I go
now on a smaller brush I'm gonna tap in
to Tropico I'm just gonna blend this in
the upper crease area I have like such a
little amount on my brush and if you can
see it's seriously it's so much product
comes off so you definitely had to go in
a light hand girl yes huh nice I just
have to take some of this reddish maroon
shade and I just gonna pop it right here
I just got to just a little I can't help
it whenever I see a color like that I'm
gonna get on my eyelid I cannot help it
now we're gonna get dangerous and we're
gonna go in with the blue shade I'm
really nervous right now because once
you go blue you just it well then your
eye look is blue and it just is what it
is but I can't like not use this blue
color because it's so creamy so I'm just
gonna pack it onto the outer corner and
I'm kind of bringing it in right here
and right here and then we're gonna go
another color and kind of fill that in
right there and it looks like I have
little um
Star Trek nests on my eyes I don't know
what that means it just I feel Star Trek
vibes on my eyes this pretty golden
shade I really want on my face so I
dampen with all the colors and that's
just out of habit I dampen shimmers
because I don't like fall out if you do
like fall out oh maybe what you doing
okay here I go
Wow now I like to go back in with the
brush that either used for the blue and
just flicker it back and forth to make
sure that softly blended out right there
in the middle because this is not a
world for harsh lines maybe well back in
with the deeper reddish shade and kind
of work on that outer corner and just
like soften that up a little bit and
we're gonna do the under eye as well
like we're down here we moslem blend out
the under eye for God's sakes now I'm
even taking the red and kind of blowing
it out a little bit I added false lashes
and a wine lonna these are Neely lashes
I don't know if you guys have ever heard
of them but they're really pretty and
these are in lavish okay now I'm gonna
take a little bit of cocoa taxi to
orange color and lid it on my lower lash
line now that we know you can do it I
got about ten thousand lip products I
need to share with you because I need to
make sure you know about them here's the
O for one that came in the bag that
would look really good
I also really like these two glosses
from pixie one is by Chloe Morello and
pixie it's really cool it's like got
this iridescent glitter in it it's like
super cool it's got a little sparkles in
it and then there's this clear one which
is very pretty I love it it's like kind
of a goopy consistency but if you want
just a clear gloss on top of your lippy
and you don't want to pay a lot for it
this one's really good and this one is a
little bit of a lip plumper as well but
these two are very nice from pixie next
one I have from shot miss a it's by that
8o a studio it is a really pretty nude
color and this one is one dollar
are you kidding my and that's actually
what I'm gonna be wearing today that's
like really
it's like really pretty probably has rat
poison in it for all I know but it's a
dollar so okay and then what else on lap
because girl I just got for my Neil a
piece a lot there's food
so this is by essence this is 11 new
love it's a really really pretty nude
color I'm going out a little bit this in
the center of my lips alright guys this
is the final look I really love how the
eyes came out I think girl what's going
on back here I really love how the look
came out I love the colors on the eyes I
love I just love everything I especially
love the skin and Hum glowing beautiful
it definitely looks like a high-end
makeup look the girl we use super
affordable products that you probably
didn't know about I'm at that below some
products that you're loving that you
don't really see a lot of people talk
about me I'm like and why oh I wanted to
share with you this little kooky
cosmetic palette I think is really cute
this is the artist palette but I know
everyone loves their warm tones so here
are some swatches I will say a couple of
the matte shades are a little like not
like wonderful but a lot of them are and
they're super affordable and if you can
see on my hands especially the deeper
colors these are really pigmented in the
shimmer so I think this is really nice
and then these little hypnotic lights
from Milani they're like foiled
eyeshadows they're kind of like the
Stila ones but there are so much less
they're like dupes I think that these
are really amazing as well they're so
cool to pack onto the eyelid and they
reflect light so well this is my
favorite one this one is called
prismatic lights 0-5 it's such a cooling
mermaidy mermaid mermaid vibe don't
forget check out box term 21 bucks a
month subscription box 5 deluxe samples
or full-size products alright that is it
for this video I love you guys so much
thank you for being here watching and I
will see you all in my next video oh it

beehive you let me pick on your face you
