video is going to be super exciting
because I'm going to be doing it get
ready well I'm not gonna get ready with
me so much on my brain I cannot even
keep up anymore I'm doing a makeup quiz
who are using products that I think are
just absolutely fabulous there are no
more than $10 so you can really find
some great signs in this video or
something you may already know about
that are just absolutely wonderful for
10 bucks or less I'm gonna be using on
my face and show you how to get a
marvelous look top ten under pan top 10
T so without further ado I'm running a
little late today on everything so we're
just gonna jump right in and get started
our spark I'm going to go in with is
this elf primer I believe this stuff it
is so poor but I don't know the exact
price I want to say like three dollars
and I think it's one of the best
drugstore primers because it makes my
skin feel really tacky and it feels
really nice and moisturizing
unfortunately the packaging doesn't say
anything on it but I'll oh my god not
seeing our subscribe song before we get
started let's go back okay so one of my
favorite foundations recently has been
the wet and wild photo focus foundation
this one is in bronze beige I believe
this is about five men and then prices
of all these products differ pretty much
come on can I get open differ pretty
much on where you buy them I mean
sometimes the drugstores in America they
have higher prices versus a Walmart
check out the walmart kinda is a
drugstore which is really like a grocery
store so targets a little bit pricey on
makeup to does any money find that those
drug stores and Target can be a little
pricey on common drugstore products so
I'm just going to blend this out
I've gotten a little bit Sun so I'm kind
of feeling like this colors a little bit
light for me that's okay well bronze the
skin and keep this video moving honey I
just have to bring you up because I
cannot like I can't with hair all over
my neck and stuff in like Perry next up
I'm going to go in with my VHS or total
cover concealer I'm using the shade 1:04
and I recently mentioned this in my
products I can't live without video
because I really love this stuff however
I've got to clean the tip off of this
girl it's nasty it gets a little messy
because like I applied the product and
then rub it in and then the tip gets
kind of gross so I just like to give it
a little wipe before I go in and ginks
it kind of has like dried concealer on
it and I will my remind you a little bit
this goes a long way so I'm going to
blend in here for a minute I feel like I
put on a lot just going to start buffing
this out in a patting motion and I like
to go back and forth back and forth to
make sure we get all those creases on
the under eye filled in and then we'll
make sure and set it with powder that
way it really really really really locks
it in and we want problems do you see
the cover just like I would say this is
feels a little more whipped than tart
tape tape so I won't faces do but I feel
like the coverage is almost there almost
of Duplin OTT quite so I won't classify
this as a dude with girl it gets the job
done and if you can see that a lot on
where I keep the video moving even
though I got a lot happening just be a
full coverage girl today pretty much
full coverage girl every day if we're
being real I mean every much is
concealed my whole nose will have to
chisel my nose back out with a contour
because girl I just like so Alyssa
Edwards I'm going to go in with a little
bit of this Rimmel and creamy beige this
is their stay matte setting powder and
I've been using this for a long time and
I've had so many this kind of pink I've
had so many people like tweet me and
tell me their love for it
a couple people tell me there's mineral
oil in this and then it just makes your
skin greasy or over time but just like
being honest I haven't dealt with that
so much so I don't really feel like I
don't know I don't really feel like it
makes my finger easier cuz I have a
little bit of Olli skin and I touch up
with this I don't find that I get it
gets worse I to really press in a
setting powder to just like really just
like press it into my skin force my skin
to drink it up now / bronzer I'm going
to be going in with this shade right
here as this Rimmel this is the coral
glow palette and this is a really pretty
bronzer color who lets carve out some
chicken bone so we're just going to buff
this in hope you guys are having a
fabulous week I actually don't know what
I'm going to be uploading this video I
don't know if I'll be in Africa or
coming back from Africa but I will be
going to ask Oh with YSL beauty and I'm
so excited about it I've always wanted
to travel there but like traveling on my
own sometimes I wouldn't know like where
to go what to book so hopefully it'll be
a really fun trip like I said I don't
know if I will have I'll be there or
back from there in this video goes live
a Pauline back but yeah that's something
that's coming up and I'm really excited
about YouTube has given me the
opportunity pretty much travel the world
I mean it's just such a gift and I value
that so much and I'd like your
experiences or something that I don't
know something that lives with you your
whole life like experiences are more
precious than material things so I'm so
excited do a little bit of no snatching
I love contouring my nose some days I go
a little hard I'll look in pictures and
be like this knows that that is not your
nose girl
but I think it's so so much beauty and
makeup and like the way you can
transform yourself or I don't know I
don't feel ugly when my nose isn't
contoured I just genuinely enjoy doing
it and I find that that is like such a
misconception people find and make up it
but really you're so much prettier
without makeup and I feel like they
think that I'm mentally so I can only do
makeup or else I feel ugly I'm like
that's definitely not the case for
I was recently sent this package by
flower beauty and this blush within it
is called pb4 kind of a weird name
there's like this iridescent blush and
these run around eight dollars if you
buy them from Walmart I don't know about
other places this is so pigmented and
it's really pretty it kind of low-key
reminds me of orgasm by NARS because
it's like pink with that gold silt her
to it Oh kind of sort of making my pores
look big because it's shimmery girl we
go and blush you today oh it's so pretty
though I can't believe yes okay let it I
would it's very pigmented so I recommend
you go in with a really light hand and
then next up or highlight you guys
probably guessed it I'm using when my
favorite highlight this is the precious
petals this is precious petals I went
wild oh man this is my brand new one
that hasn't even been opened and now I
have no fingernails to open it lately
I've been doing my face makeup first for
no specific reason it's just like
something to get out of the way and then
I move on to my eye makeup what do you
guys like to do first your eyes or your
face I thought I'd be using like a lot
of dark colors I normally regret doing
my very first cuz to fall out and you
try to like clean it up but lately this
just held into LaMichael now I'm going
to just set my face with and make it
last setting spray from Milani mani get
me on to the stuff and the weird thing
about it it smells like perfume in it
smells so good so I always show you guys
how it like sets on the hairs on my face
and I like to just press it in press it
in press it in I'm going to be trying
out this brow precise and pull by
Maybelline um I actually don't know how
this one product works seems very waxy
but pigmented it kind of reminds me of
the colour-pop eyebrow pencils
really really really waxy I'm just gonna
use my spoolie for my benefit pencil oh
wait this one has a spoolie huh just
kidding
so the thing is the brow pencil is a
medium brown and I feel like it's so
waxy that it makes it turn dark brown
once you get it on it's not that bad
I just not like dying over it
you know I'm these color pops wake-up
call and I'm going to apply this all
over as my transition shade now I did go
in with a little bit of that BH
concealer and just put it on my eyelids
it's a very thin layer to prime my
eyelids if you don't ever have the
primer on hand you can always tell on
your concealer to kind of do the job for
you using note to self this is another
color pop eyeshadow I'm just going to
pop this right in the outer corner as
well as in the crease keeping it kind of
sort of low
I'm going to use popular demand all
these are by colour-pop by the way and a
little bit of a smaller brush I'm going
to then really keep it low and down in
the crease kind of putting it where I
put the brown shade but using a little
bit less eyeshadow and then I'm going to
put just a dab in that inner corner and
then flip it back over like I'm going to
add the touch of that concealer to the
center of my lid with my finger and then
I'm going to take ego and apply it to
the center of the lid I'm going to be
using my trusty finger to do so oh so
pretty all chill primi and then if you
want to leave your look like this you
absolutely can I think this is just done
nine but because I've done similar looks
to this before I want to jazz it up a
little bit and give you guys some more
info so I got these little sparkly and I
think I'm going to use sand dunes which
this is a bronze rose gold one I have
gold like yellow gold and silver but
this one is just screaming my name the
most especially with the lip color I
want to do now these even find at a
craft store or anything like that
they're so affordable and so easy to
find little glitter so I'm just going to
apply them to the center and kind of
like you dish it up a little bit this is
my little magnifying mirror that helps
create so much I'm going to be really
meticulous and apply these like this
with little tweezers the best tip I have
for you is to grab it by the corner add
a little bit of glitter glue else makes
a really good a formal one and then just
set it down on your eyelid Pat and walk
away if you're looking for specific
glitters from like the craft store I got
these at Urban Decay a set of three it
was a really affordable but if you're
looking forward like a really affordable
little craft store glitter
I suggest finding ones that isn't so
much like tiny sparkles that you get in
your eye maybe more so something like
chunks like this these are like
different colors of rose gold and I'm
kind of living I gotta say
I've seen a lot of looks where people
put glitter on lightly like on the
eyelid and one of my favorite one ever
is the Instagram account by Brooke L oh
my god that girl has the clothes makeup
looks and she definitely is so inspiring
to me
you guys gotta check it out I think
she's just the coolest stuff I think she
should meet our New Zealand or Australia
okay nice thing in my sparkle I kind of
want a little bit of a deeper I show I
don't know if I should though SIA is
super fancy I think it's really pretty
though and once I get lashes on it's
gonna really be ba boom I'm actually
going to add a little bit of cloud 9 to
the outer corners to deepen it up right
there deepen that up a little bit
I added some flashes and I need it you
from violet Voss and these lashes are
ten bucks apiece and now I'm going to go
in with that first shade which was our
transition shade and while that lash
glue trying to grab some of the color
while the lash glue is drying I'm
actually going to go ahead and start
blending out the lower lash line I'm
going to take a tighter brush and blend
that darkest brown color down on the
lower lash line as well and keeping it
really tight to the lashes now that our
lashes are drying I'm going to go in
with a little bit of this new lash
paradise mascara from L'Oreal now this
one really the price varies where you
buy it
so this soon Walmart is going to be your
cheapest option for this mascara and now
I have it this lipstick from colour-pop
cuffs it's called trust me and it is red
and I feel like you haven't read lips
today so we're gonna have some red lips
alright guys this is the final look this
was such a cute little cute and we did
the cool I look with a products that
were ten dollars and under how this
tutorial was inspiring for you guys I'll

below in the description thank you guys

love you guys to death and I hope you
