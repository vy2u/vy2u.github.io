video is going to be a makeup tutorial
using only products that are five
dollars or less I did a light spring
tiny people
Pinkle I need to get my life together
real quick I did a light springtime EP
get purpley look it's really soft on the
eyes that I wanted to keep everything
just kind of light not to cry cry my
eyes are watering so bad let me know the
weather changing
I got it eating put watering now I'm not
wearing extensions today either guys
this is just like my hair also if you
haven't already be sure and into my
giveaway that I got going on Instagram
is under this picture and there are 10
winners 10 prices low the makeup super
easy to enter the head over to lolly on
Instagram be sharing in time but yeah
that's all I got for you on this
beautiful Saturday well it probably
won't be Saturday when I upload this I
don't know when it will be when I upload
this okay let's get right in and get
started our first is hair girlfriend's
got to get out of my way it's like so
fluffy today
well alright jumping right and I'm going
to start with my for my favorite primers
from ELF you just like a clear monster
Iser and what I really like about it
it's just thick it feels so expensive
and not only that it makes your face a
little bit tacky and it's like your
foundation is going to adhere to your
skin really well I've been playing with
this primer for a minute now and I've
really been enjoying it my next it's our
foundation the foundation is from wet
and wild and you guys already know that
I've been loving this this one is in
cream so cream beige can heal it so I've
been eating hot cheetos I also love the
spatulas it comes on it I'm going to
take a white the Express from morphe ss
out this is one of my favorite
foundation brushes in the whole wide
world it it's like the perfect kabuki
and the guilded collection is it's not
like dirt cheap but they're way more
affordable I sleep this brush is seven
bucks then a lot of the brushes out
there on the market and they're like
fabulous precious they're super soft of
Leno's so incredibly well be sure and
get down the neck I'm going to go ahead
and blend it always blend it right here
and like on my earlobe so that way it's
kind of seamless and I try to pick it up
a little bit in my hairline but not get
too much of my hair lengths and it like
makes my hair turn gray kind of a weird
thing
all right so since this foundation is
like five and ninety-nine this concealer
is like $2.99 and I figure if you add
them together it like makes up for the
difference and no so I'm going to be
using the concealer that kind of goes
with the foundation this is the photo
focus concealer and I really like it's
very soft on the skin it's kind of thick
so I have to like get a little bunch of
it out to use it but it's really pretty
I think this one yeah this is
light/medium in case you guys are
wondering I'm going to put this is
probably like too much that I'm putting
on so that'll be fun to blend out here
she's fussing because ty left and went
hiking and she gets upset whenever he
leaves her so I'm going to continue with
the same brush the white stick brush
from morphe and I'm just going to dab
that out in this little patting motion
any type of kabuki brush like this you
can just blend out all your cream now
you're probably going to have to wash
your brush way more often if you are
blending out a lot of different Krampus
is going to get compacted with a lot of
products it's going to stop performing
as well so
blends out some nicely so I just like to
tap it out really you just go like this
and I'll get you a seamless look just
know now that that is done I'm going to
use my tried-and-true this is in creamy
beige this is these stay matte from
Rimmel and this is the e41 brush from
morphe this is part of their elite
collection so these brushes are a little
bit more fancy smancy and what I'm going
to do with this powder here is I'm going
to get some on my brush and I'm just
going to Pat it into my skin which is
really going to set everything and make
it last longer I have to go get her life
is a cat ball princess okay so I'm just
going to step on my makeup and this is
pretty much a translucent setting powder
I'm going to take that I put a nine
brush from morphe and get a lot of the
powder on there and this is a smaller
brush so I can get more precise and
really set pull we have to set that
under-eye to make sure that concealer
doesn't run away it doesn't what does
that does increase that way we'll be
looking the bomb bigger day I know you
may be saying
your face looks super powdery but we'll
spritz it with some spray kind of melt
this powder down so it's less matte and
a little bit more skin like okay so I
had a real problem with the bronzers I
like the next one right here and the
Revlon like right here but they're like
$6 or like $5.99 as well so they're like
oh we sit over the prize by a couple
cents depending on where you buy them
that is like a target I think they're a
little more expensive I'm going to take
the r7 rose-gold brush because I think
this one's a little cheaper the the
Revlon not maybelline one when I get
some this on my brush pull that hair
back watch and then I'm just going to
bronze up my skin with this today and
because I've set my makeup the powder is
going on top of a powder so it's
blending out a little bit easier rather
than sticking to the foundation hope you
guys appreciate all my sound effects
that I always do now for blush I'm going
to do like a rosy Mavi cheek this one is
in nude it's my makeup revolution and it
is exactly five dollars whoa I'm going
to take this angled y-4 brush from the
morphe guild at collections picks up a
lot of product I'm just going to buff it
onto the cheek and now for my favorite
part I'm going it to add a highlight uh
this is my favorite drugstore
highlighter at the moment this is the
wet-and-wild mega glow highlighting
powder and this one isn't / crushes have
precious petals can't reject this is a
whi 14 for morphe brush and I'm going to
slip it on tap off the excess you don't
even need a wet these eyeliners are like
Mac's its pleasant for them to work
because they just honey they glow on
their own they do all the work for you
so I just like to flicker this and I
like to do you see how highlights like
pick up texture in the skin it's like
wine I do we like that though so I try
not to take it like right here I try to
make sure and keep the highlight around
the cheekbone Ickes wiggled around the
temple and then with my finger or you
could do a brush snatch the nose a
little you know little nose match in
action and then I'll go back in with a
little fluffy brush and this
Chris what across my upper lip that way
looks like I've been drinking a lot of
milk alright man go ahead and risk my
face before I do my eyes so I have these
two setting sprays this one cost more
than five dollars so I'm not gonna be
using it but also I tested this one out
I definitely felt like my face for the
end of the day was pretty gross looking
like my makeup was like separating
completely on my forehead and it looked
a mess so I'm going to be using this NYX
Mac matte finish spray I don't know why
I can finish saying that first and I
like to take a Beauty Blender it just
like sits on top of the skin and just
like press in those powers what's really
beating my face oh my goodness all that
setting spray so if you guys do know
morphe make single eyeshadows so I'm
going to be using some of these I'm
going to take silk by morphe which is a
great cream color and what I like to do
is I really like to set the primer that
I have down and I just like to dust it
back and forth all over the lids it's a
really easy step it makes everything
easier to blend out I'm going to take
flawless with a more PR 39 brush I'm
just going to swivel it in the upper
crease as my transition shade just
taking it I like to do like small I
rounded like motions and like do a
little small windshield wipers into the
big ones like this because I find that I
get too messy when I do that so I'll
just take little tiny swipes to get it
really soft and blend it out actually
absolutely no idea what make it look I'm
about to do I just have a bunch of
beautiful eyeshadows laying out in front
of me and I'm like what am I going to do
with them all who is this so long since
I've done a voice over video guys let me
know if you want me to do more voiceover
or talk through let me know in the
comments what you like better because
I've been doing talk through and it kind
of makes a video a bit longer but
voiceovers kind of precise and like
straight to the point versus talk
there's a little crazy messy and all
over the place so let me know what you
like so I kinda would simply use our
next color from morphe I'm going to take
its elaboration I think that's how you
pronounce it and I'm using the same r39
brush and I'm just going to take this
shade and line buff it into that crease
right there just like small motions that
way the color doesn't explode and like
go everywhere and we're going to kind of
push it on to the
outer corner of the eye I'm going to do
it obviously the exact same thing over
here I don't know how to tell you that
I'm going to do the same thing on this
eye
obviously now just to deepen that outer
V of my eye I'm going to take private
agent
same brush you can use this brush for
like a whole tutorial if you want it to
it just blends out the color so
seamlessly so I'm just going to keep
rolling with them because I love as I
wash and the darker the color I try not
to take the colors up so highlight to
keep the darker colors a little bit
lower and that way my eye doesn't like
it's exploding the dark color now I do
remember there's no rules and makeup and
you can do your makeup however you want
these are just tips and tricks if you
can see I'm just doing small motions
back and forth like to kind of blend out
that outer corner I'm going to take
Sweet Escape which is a shimmery pink
color and put it on my eyelid and what I
always like to do is just press the
colors into my lid rather than really
blending them I'm just trying to get as
much pigment as I can out of the colors
any shimmer you can really wet too if
you want to with water or something plus
their setting spray or whatever you have
on deck and it will really enhance the
color of that pigment and it will make
your eyelids pop alright I'm going to
take Lam live from morphine add it to my
brow bone and inner corner we can take
an e30 pencil brush to do the inner
corner this one is by Sigma beuter I'm
just going to pop that in and blend it
on up a little bit and that really opens
up that in our corner makes the eyes pop
and then I'm just going to add a little
bit to the brow bone to lift us above
all and tie the whole look together I
can never decide if I wear wing it out
let me hold up my lashes today I'm going
to be using the foaming lashes from our
dough with an invisible band
girl what is the oh these are a 12 I'm
pretty okay I want to keep the look
light without wing liner and like
springtime and like fluttery flirty
lashes and build up the mascara this I
think this one I'm going to do you know
what saying
I put the Milani stay-put liner and just
tight line oh look so freaky
anyway I like to do just to define the
edge like really tied to the lashes
don't pull your eye like I'm pulling my
eye I'll shoot I like to add a little
darkness so you can't see the lash band
so this liner right here is super milky
and gives you some play time with it to
move it around but once it dries it
settles in really nicely and it doesn't
move down by Milani it kinda reminds me
of the sa water eyeliners which are my
actual favorite so that was a really
nice black eyeliner option if you are
looking for one okay let's trim these
lashes up make them fit my eyelid always
customize your lashes piece don't just
snatch my boss the Papuan your eye
because they are not made to fit every
single eyelid alright so this is kind of
thin but we're in a roll with them I do
really like these and because like they
have a really thin ban is it weird they
like I have a harder time with Dan bands
than I do with thick bands like the six
man just like onto my eye and the spin
was I like aa little pleasers and stuff
now I'm going to go in with some candy
blue and I'm just going to buff this
from I'm not going to take it all the
way in because it's a little bit of a
deep purple color but I'm going to buff
it about a quarter of the way in right
here in the outer corner and kind of
connect it to that outer corner right
there just small little commotion
getting these false lashes on both eyes
so watering the glue is not wanting to
stick and it's so annoying
oh no what I did to deserve this now I'm
going to take private agent and really
smoke this closer to the lash line visit
that stay put liner from Milani in the
waterline and then I'm going to take my
Big Shot mascara from Maybelline and
just pop a little on my lower lashes so
we are almost done now for my lips I'm
going to take these they're five dollars
each I'm going to take these Maybelline
these are D a new line of lip ease and
they're all matte and really pretty I'm
gonna take a beige babe next up I'll
take purely nude just add it into the
center I guess it for this video I hope
