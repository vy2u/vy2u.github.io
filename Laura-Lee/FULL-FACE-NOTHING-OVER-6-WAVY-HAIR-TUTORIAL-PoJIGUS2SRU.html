channel today's video is definitely in a
different room as because they are
working on butts off downstairs in our
new home so in my beauty room like
you're literally working on it at the
door of my beauty room and they're
drilling and all kinds of stuff so
that's an absolute cannot happen can't
film in there today so I'm filming in a
spare bedroom in my new home today and
by the way I want to tell you guys I'm
gonna do a house tour but I gotta get my
house decorated because he not very
decorated house so much I want to do but
I'll do a home floor but it's probably
untaken me a few months because it got a
lot to decorate that is besides the
point
also in this video I have partnered with
new me I mean using the opto one set it
is a curling set with 8 different ones
and then here's the curler right here
this is what I'll be using today I'm
gonna show you guys how I got this hair
look right here I love new me to tools I
use them all the time I'm so so so so so
grateful for them to be partnering with
me for this video and I organically just
use their stuff all the time I've been
using them since I started my channel so
thank you so much Nui for partnering
with me I really appreciate it and I
truly believe in your products and I
think they're great so also it comes in
this really cool black zip-up case is
absolutely amazing for travel and it's
super small and compact which I like
it's not huge roll out case so yeah it's
a hard bag nice cake and you get all
eight ones plus the curler in here and
it does come with a glove for safety so
you don't burn it yourself great for
travel super great kit I'll talk about a
little later and you say to the end of
the video I do have a code that is not
affiliated for you guys for new me
you'll know more about that but just
hang out to the end of the video because
first we're gonna do makeup Aaron's I'm
gonna be using makeup six dollars in
under okay honey I pulled out some of my
favorite products I think are really
great for a really really really
affordable price I'm gonna try to find
the links that I found online where they
are six dollars and under but yeah this
is my favorite affordable makeup and I
have it's been like a little bit since I
have film one of these videos like
really affordable makeup so I thought I
would take advantage
do that today so hope you guys like the
look I created thanks for being here
watching I'm gonna go ahead and throw in
the subscribe song right now
I'm subscribe to my channel if for you
and now we can jump to the beach
I'm using my ELF primer just dropped it
and I am going to apply this I talked
about this so much and how much I love
it so you guys already know about it but
I'm just gonna apply this all over it's
gonna be a little bit more difficult
getting ready in here cuz I don't have
like my stand-up mirror look at that
left hand for foundation I'm gonna be
using my wet and wild foundation this is
the photo focus one and I am in shade
cream beige and I really like this
foundation besides the price point even
if it was it looks on Dacian I like it
you know either way cheaper high I think
it's great I'm not just using it in this
video just because it's cheap I mean
that is why I pulled it for this video
but you guys know I've talked about so
many times on my channel that I really
enjoy it and I think it's I think it's
truly great dealing downfall and a lot
of people complain about this is this
smell is not very good and I forgot to
bring up my white 6 brush from morphe in
here to blend it out so I'm super pissed
at myself right now and super annoyed so
I'm just gonna use this artiste brush
that wasn't the bottom of the makeup bag
and just so you know this brush is so
disgusting and I probably shouldn't you
use that on my face it just has so much
makeup caked in it I'm gonna have to use
it for my concealer as well this
foundation blends it all on your skin
like it's literally a butter just like
melting into the skin it blends so so
easy I really like it and like I scraped
my nose I just forget how much I love it
it just like melts next for concealer
I'm gonna be using the colour-pop new
filter concealer I'm gonna use the shade
oh to light this is a six dollar
concealer and I've tested out before my
channel in a war very well oh mama I
think this shade is a little bit too
light for me sometimes I just have the
hardest time finding my shades and
concealers and I always stick with the
NARS creamy radium just because that
shade is so good to me so so good to me
so I'm just like I know it's right I
know it's good yeah this is too light oh
oh she's gonna be highlighted today
we're setting powder you guys already
know I'm gonna be
saying you guys might not know this but
I'm gonna be using this day map by
Rimmel I talked about this several times
my channel and I really do enjoy this
setting powder so I will and this runs
between four and five bucks if you get
it at Target
I think Walmart is normally the cheapest
place to buy affordable makeup but
Target and Rite Aid and like CBS a
little bit more high so if you google
online you can normally catch the
cheapest price is there a g35 brush I'm
gonna be using it to apply it it's just
a soft little fluffy brush I'm just
gonna push that in I'm gonna push it
right on top of the concealer to make
sure and set it and forget it
I'm gonna take my r14 brush for bronzer
and today I'm going to be using the NYC
Sun and bronze so this has a little bit
of shimmer in it and there's a few
shades to strike back and forth across
you can get this around 4 bucks at the
drugstore it's super affordable and I
like to mix all the shades together tap
off the excess and then go ahead and
bronze up my skin and drugstore makeup
is so interesting because like you you
gotta find the good stuff like you've
got to go around you got to find the
good the right stuff but once you do
like honestly I think the look can come
out just as good as a super high-end
look I just feel you have to go wrong
find the right stuff first some stuff is
a little floppy but let's be real with
high-end makeup honestly some stuff is a
little bit floppy too so that's what
these great youtube use before you know
we break it down for you and tell you
the truth so I have several videos on my
channel where I talk about drug
surprises didn't work out for me so you
can find those on my channel if you're
interested in what doesn't work in case
you're curious but I also do a lot of
favorites and I do a lot of drugs or
tutorials and talk about drugstore
makeup so you guys are and I just
drugstore makeup just affordable makeup
in general because it doesn't have to be
drugstore makeup ooh this is so pretty
it has like a golden glow to it I don't
know if you guys can see because the
lighting of course it's a little bit
different because I have this cheap
little octa light right here and the
overhead light and verses in my beauty
remember have all kinds of crazy fancy
light so it is quite a bit different
honestly this bronzer has me gag right
now like how absolutely freaking
gorgeous it is it is so this is so
pretty okay so next I am gonna skip
blush could you guys know I do that a
lot and I'm not going with my favorite
drugstore highlighters this is the one
from Wet n Wild this one's called
precious petals Oh No today's I'm using
golden flower crowns so this is a more
golden one but I actually meant to grab
precious petals it's called something
like that that's my actual favorite one
but this one I've tried before on my
channel and I love it I'm gonna take our
39 brush highlighter brush and I'm going
to so ready I just don't know how they
keep these in stock because they're so
affordable they're so so so so so pretty
I mean I'm glowing honey I'm goin okay
next up is a product that I'm going to
be using it is from morphe they came out
with their brow pencils and these are a
whopping $5 they're so affordable so I'm
going to use C what shade today I'm
gonna used to say chokolate mousse i
swatched a few of them and these
definitely have like the almond and the
cinnamon have a little bit more of a
reddish tone to it
chocolate mousse is pretty deep I
recommend with these you warm them up on
the back of your hand to get it going
whenever you first buy it and like twist
it around and color on your hand to get
the product melty and warm and get it
rocking and rolling has a really fine
tip on it and it's fully on the back in
about two comb Suzy's brows and then it
just it melts right off the brows can
you guys see that and this is a five
dollar pencil five dollars which you
guys know everybody uses the NYX brow
pencil what does it do for the on
associate brow Wiz but reality is that's
ten dollars it's still somewhat
affordable you know for about pencil but
this is fine
that's half at that one so I think I'll
start you got Dubai next and then new
Dubai morphine who's gonna do more if
you want to make $1 one huh one brown
down the other one ago so now to kind of
carve out the brows I'm gonna take this
$3 concealer stick
I don't really prefer to use sticks like
this under my eye I think it's a little
bit too greasy and heavy
specifically this was from morphe I love
a lot of their products but this one
just is not for my I'm sorry I'm trying
to find a brush at the same time that
I'm like talking to you guys but this
one is just a little bit too thick for
my under-eye so I'm gonna use this $3
concealer shake to carve up my eyebrows
I'm also going to use it as an eyeshadow
primer so guys I really can't decide
what to do my hair the blonde is
literally so hard it is so drying and I
know a lot of you guys know it's so hard
to keep up with and plus like I have so
this is so much gray hair that I can't
not dye my roots so I have to keep my
roots dyed dark to hide the greys and if
I kept blond all the way up at the roots
girl it would be a mess
I'm just so little maintenance I can't
do that so it's just like this constant
battle of keeping this I just got a dyed
like my roots but this constant battle
I'm trying to keep him my together with
my hair whenever it's blond so I'm very
tempted to go back dark
I haven't had dark hair and in long a
long time most of you didn't even know
me with dark hair so I don't here I
don't think I had anything I had yeah
like I've always had some dye in my hair
on YouTube like I probably had like a
hundred thousand subscribers whenever my
hair was dark glass so I think I'm ready
to like take it back there and get back
to my roots of dark hair the only thing
that sucks is whenever I do that like
I'm gonna be committed to it for a long
time because it it's so hard to get this
hair color light because I'm so
naturally dark so I don't know guys
comment down the comments
what you think I should do so now we're
gonna jump into my no kill la collab
with colour-pop and again I make no
money off this every single drop of the
proceeds of this goes to saving animals
lives so and the colors are absolutely
gorgeous I created them myself so first
I'm gonna go in with what color I'm
gonna go in with glitz first which is
the more pinky color so I've been
enjoying using soft brushes with this
I'm gonna use a whi 19 brush and
honestly I know these are a little bit
different about a shadow texture but you
can literally just kind of tap into
there's no tap off there's no fall out
there's no excess cuz these are a little
creamy so it's a little bit different I
still tap because of my hat I like such
a habit of tapping it off which I think
it's so funny um but if you can see you
can just mush it on the eye and then
because the brush is so soft you can
just blend it on out you can build these
up too because if you can see here the
color is super light pink literally this
lash glue girl it's got to go oh I just
pulled the biggest hunk of lash glue out
of my lash and it was the most stress
relieving relaxing thing I think I've
ever done in my entire life which may
sound weird but if you've ever done it
before you know it just like it's like
yes if you guys are wondering why it's
like dark around my eye I started using
a lash glue which I shouldn't have I
can't remember the name of it but it's
horrible like your lashes won't come off
like your false lashes won't come off be
a real lashes will so I'm losing real
lashes left and right such a bad
situation makes me so sad I wish I never
used it I've literally put everything
that I know to put it on my between the
most oily products I know to get this
off my eyes I can't get it off of my
eyes so that is super annoying and I you
guys are like Laura stop wearing clothes
lashes but you know your girl's addicted
and I can't sup I really can't I just
feel crazy without them I feel crazy
with them what am I talking about they
just want to do like this soft beautiful
pinky I look so today I'm going to take
the hiney which is this really beautiful
copper a glitzy very glitzy color and
with the shimmers I like to apply them
with my fingers
slee like that it's so sparkly so it's
so easy you can swallow your finger
around the thing and just pop it onto
your lid I just do like little pressing
motions to apply it when I take a 250s
eyeliner brush and lately I've just been
kicking him back into my wing liner I'm
kind of weird I go like months with no
bling liner then all of a sudden every
single day a wing I don't know I can
never make up my mind I don't know
that's just me or you guys do that to be
using this wet and wow this is ca 1:30
cream eye liner in black and this is
highly recommended from my home to yours
this went wild eyeliner I think it's
super good what a bright time is the
right time to rock so I know some people
like on YouTube are weird about filming
in front of people and me personally
like I will film and from an audience of
like 20 people if I need to Lee I
totally don't care okay so hype I'll do
it like I love talking to people I love
being in front of people I love speaking
to crowd it's like I love the whole bit
and some people are like absolutely not
don't come near me don't listen to me
don't film like nothing and but I'm not
opposite like I'm like yes let's do it
let's have a party mom I feel whenever I
first saw my channel Oh hide in my room
so I lived in a house with two other
girls I really hide it in my room if I
heard like the slightest creak I would
stop someone go run outside to make sure
they weren't home or they wouldn't even
get near me or hear me or anything I
would be bored if I would die if I knew
they heard me filming I'll be still
embarrassing I just think it's so funny
like now I'm just like okay poor mascara
I'm actually gonna try out this new one
I have one eye done but I'm a pause and
do it I'm gonna try this waterproof
lengthening mascara from ELF looks like
this I think it's one of their newer
ones I haven't had that good of luck
with ELF mascaras but actually let's see
this one's definitely better than their
past ones because it's a little bit
thicker it's not so watery which I'm
like
so this is the first mascara ever from
else that I've ever liked
that's goodness gonna take some more of
glitz and I'm going to apply it to the
under eye I also applied some of the lux
lashes from Eylure and don't hate me but
they are I found a website where they're
six dollars and some change rather than
just six dollars that is the only thing
on my face that is just a touch touch
touch more than the six dollar price
point that I mentioned so now I'm gonna
go in with a little bit of the deeper
color and this one is called shiny and
I'm going to take their shiz number
twenty eight brush from ABH just get it
right there on the tip I'm gonna buff it
right in there at the lower lash line
and it's gonna give us a little bit more
dimension a little bit more of a smoky
look
just keeping it really close because it
is a darker color I'm gonna take some of
my ELF mascara and hit those lower
lashes with it
yeah I like this mascara like it's nice
for the lower lashes too I'm gonna take
my morphe lip pencil this one is in
backseat love and this is a kind of
looks like soar from Mac these are only
three dollars a piece they're super
super affordable
come on dry skin I'm gonna go ahead and
line my lips with them okay i line my
lip I mean fill in my whole entire lip
so I got carried away and now I'm gonna
go ahead and take my collab with color
pop in Oak Hill LA in a glam and this is
a really sparkly lip gloss and these are
five dollars a piece if you buy them in
bundle if you buy all three because it
makes them 15 total for three or if you
buy it separately is six dollars so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply this on top
I love it looks so good okay now we are
finally gonna move on to the hair okay
guys so I'm going to take this medium
sized one out of the kit and you just
pop it right in there and you can see
the little turn I'm gonna turn to lock
it boom
so you see that it's locked it's not
gonna pop out it says off right now so
I'm gonna power on by holding it down
and then I'm gonna turn it all the way
up to 450 I like to crank it all the way
out so it gets real nice and hot now I
have my hair sectioned off I typically
comb my hair by sectioning it off how
much already have a tight up and just
the bottom pieces down I'm gonna brush
through it and I'm gonna go ahead and
clip in a little bit of a hair extension
and then I'll curl my hair extension in
with my hair so those tools really easy
to use and it curls the hair in seconds
and it heats up so fast so we're already
at 450 and also it comes with a glove if
you're not used to curling with a wand
without a clip on it I recommend using
go up because you can burn yourself so
what I like to do is hold the one upside
down I have it plugged in back there so
the cords kind of right here but I'll
hold the one upside down against the
hair and then I roll the hair around it
like a ribbon instead of twisting the
hair around it I wrap it around there
great thing is it adds some shine and it
keeps the moisture retain into your hair
this probably one does so because my
hair it's colored hair the great thing
that this the great thing is that this
wand is safe to use on color hair it
helps you retain moisture as well
because I have super dry hair so also I
like to give it a few squeezes oh look
at that curl so it has a pure tourmaline
barrel which makes the one more healthy
to use in the traditional curling lon
so because this is a 1 it does have a
clip on it it helps not put creases in
your hair too because sometimes the clip
on curling irons give you that crease
but this is more of a 1 so you're not
gonna get that for his last few say hey
I'm gonna do the same thing when I'm
gonna point the tool upward and that way
it's just easier and I don't burn myself
especially because I have the cord
plugged in back there I just went ahead
and did this out of my hair and now I
take down the rest of my hair so now I'm
gonna do oh this half I'm going to just
part it with my finger flip it on over
I'm gonna clip in this little to Clippy
right here I know it doesn't match my
hair at the roots one shift flip it over
it hides the track probably why my
tracks are always showing you guys know
that's a part of my hairstyle - oh you
guys didn't know I'm gonna fish my hair
I do the same thing by the way I flip it
upside down and I wrap the hair around
like a ribbon not twisting it and
sometimes I leave a little towel in out
just kind of keeping it a little bit
tight at the root sit there for 20 20 to
15 to 20 seconds release squeeze leave
ah boom that's what is such a pretty
shiny curl coming also new me is giving
you guys the discount code Lara for 20%
off the entire new me website that's
that code is not affiliated they just
give me that code and partnership with
them for you guys to use the website and
also with the link that I'll give you

to use code la bra it is my name I'll
put on the screen if you want 20% off
the whole entire new me website
including the octo onset
I think it helps I mean I'm not the
queen of hiding attract obviously but I
think it helps us somewhat hi - ah if
you put the extensions in and CRO your
hair with the extensions I think it
helps and I don't leave my hair like
this curled
I'll lightly kind of tease it out and
that way it looks a little bit softer
and more natural which you'll see me do
last piece and my whole upside down
release it a little squeezy poo I'm just
going to lightly brush through the curls
and it's gonna give me a nice soft
pretty curly weight and this is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you enjoyed it in this room

different maybe a little bit ah my next
