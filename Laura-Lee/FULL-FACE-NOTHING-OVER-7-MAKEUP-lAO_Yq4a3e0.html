already been doing I did a full face of
makeup using makeup only at five dollars
a full face makeup only at six dollars
and now we are bumping it up and getting
crazy I'm doing a full face of makeup at
seven whole doll hairs like it means
like the makeup there's nothing in the
tutorial used over seven dollars I also
have a lot of products that I have not
used on my channel yet such as the
makeup revolution foundation a couple of
different things from wet and wild that
you guys have been asking me to use so I
might choking on my hoodie right now I'm
gonna be using some of that in this
video and I'm real excited about it
alright now we can go ahead and jump
right into video
I feel like I have a little case of the
Mondays but that's okay we're gonna get
through it
I got a clam I got a meeting my toenails
are chit they look like crap I got a
hundred different
they're coming it's my first priority
today so beginning with it I'm gonna be
using this day mat this is from normal
London is a facial primer and it's also
used to help your foundation in skin
State now I'm actually gonna squeegee on
about a pea-sized amount to my Beauty
Blender this is dampened and I'm just
gonna fish this all over my skin I love
starting with a facial primer I also
have a mustache right now that I'm gonna
work on later but it's Monday so we're
just gonna leave it there and you guys
can pretend like you don't see it next
for foundation which I'm excited to try
I'm like come on dry is the makeup
revolution this is their new stick
foundation I have f9 f10 and f7 let me
open these up her I am NOT if7 check ok
maybe up 10 it might be an f10 it kind
of feels crazy yeah f10 like is
literally the same color of my skin
that's great
so this is a new thick foundation from
then I'm really excited to try I love
their concealer that I tried out in a
video if you haven't seen it I have four
view of their concealer and it is very
similar to the Tarte shaped a pin it's
seven bucks things like $6.99 I'm not
mistaken so I'll be using that today's
video I'm blending this out with a why
six and it's blending like butter so
it's also kind of heavy though like its
kind of heavy filling on my skin
slightly cakey feeling but the blend is
right so we're working on a hundred
thanks for larlie Los Angeles and I hope
you guys this foundation by the way it
looks really pretty and I'm pretty
excited this is supposed to be a first
impression so sorry I didn't ride this
out beforehand but I'm just like oh yes
like I love this so far our launch our
next launch is gonna be in April oh I
dropped it now there's concealer
everywhere our next launch is gonna be
in April I will have
date by the end of this week on the
exact launch date I would tell you right
now if I knew we just have like it's
literally you guys are gonna get it hot
off the press so I just have to make
sure my distribution will be ready so I
have to give you guys a date we're in
between two dates and I have to get the
right date
picked so that's happening and then in
May we'll be launching a continuation
like of the collection that we're
launching in April so I have a couple of
different products launching that
obviously you guys haven't seen before
I'm just so excited I actually started
working on this collection before Kat's
was even available for sale we had
already started this it took me really
long time to get it together because
she's a picky girl and I think my
picking this pays off though at the end
of the day because because I know you
guys are spending very hard-earned money
on these products and I just want you
guys to get the best and get the most
usage out of them so it's very important
by the way I'm gonna take this color pop
concealer in the shade dark 48 and
contour a little bit with it on that you
guys truly enjoy the product and are
able to use it and love the formula so
my pickiness has paid off a lot of
people and a lot of hard work went into
this collection so I truly hope you guys
enjoy it I'm like thrilled for you guys
to see it like I know you guys are gonna
love it I actually spent my whole
morning going through our photo shoot we
did a photo shoot last Wednesday and I
spent my whole entire morning going
through all the pictures and picking the
ones I wanted and they look so good it
like took everything in my body not to
just pick up my phone and start
snapchatting and showing you guys like
everything and just be like look how
pretty these are that was really cool
too and I'm super excited
it just can't come soon enough I'm like
please yeah I'll have a video up
obviously sharing with you guys the
whole collection and sharing with you
guys like everything so you just just
hang tight okay for setting powder I'm
gonna go in with the NYC this is the
smoothest skin facial powder dear God we
have a mess on our hands I'm like still
loving this foundation just like as a
three-minute check-in I'm still loving
it
and then I'm just gonna go in with some
of this natural bronzer from Rimmel so
go ahead and set that contour that I had
applied onto our brush I use every day
is that our 14 from morphe I'm just
gonna dust some of this right on top of
that cream product just a hard-and-fast
note anytime I put down a cream I
literally put a powder on top of it or
else it will Slough slide around
throughout the day
eyebrows have these two brow pencils
from morphe these are super super
affordable I believe these are around 3
or 4 bucks
I have these two pallets from
wet-and-wild I think they're so pretty
these around four to five bucks and I've
always had a really pretty much a really
good experience with wet and wild I
shadow so they're definitely worth yacon
I think I'm gonna go in I'm like looking
back and forth hmm I think when I first
go in with this shade right here this
palette is called the not a basic peach
and then this one is called rose in the
air I always start my looks with a m57
three brush I'm going to take our 39
brush in this transition shade
I'm gonna tap in to this shade right
here on the same brush and what I like
to do is I really like to like Pat these
colors in first you get like all the
pigment and then I'll softly go in and
blend them out that way it's not patchy
but I love like pushing them in like
building up all that pretty color and
then next up I'm gonna grab some of the
dark brown on the same brush and I'll
end up doing the exact same thing I will
just start pushing it in these mats are
absolutely beautiful in these wet wild
palettes like I'm loving them I'm gonna
carve out my eyelid a little bit with
that concealer and then going with this
pretty fiery gold color and then a
little bit of this I really like using
it in 41 brush to carve out
a little bit of that reddish shade just
to soften up where the creases hit that
way there's not that harsh line there
honey we gotta blend it out now I'm
gonna grab just a little bit of that
gold shade on the m41
and just add just a touch of it in the
center that way it like the light
reflects off of it in the center and it
looks so creamy
I'm gonna take some this elf liquid
liner and literally just line the
tightest bed that I can on the water
line so that way when I put lashes on
you can't see a gap I'm gonna go ahead
and curl these eyelashes almost rip them
out god I hate when I curl my lashes and
then the lash curler likes lips and I'm
like about to rip out every hair I'm
gonna go in it with the scandalize from
Rimmel and just hit these lashes I don't
kiss lashes in the shade in the shade
girl the style teddy war highlighter I'm
going to put on the mega glow
highlighter from Hello what and wow this
one's called
Goddess glow I may have put too much but
you can just never really have enough i
legit keep dropping everything today oh
that's so pretty I love it these
highlighters are so pretty wet mouth
make like the best drugstore
highlighters I'm so sorry but girl they
just got that area taken okay I'm like
obsessed with this gold color I just
feel like I need to bathe in it it looks
so natural to it like melts into your
skin that's the one thing I love about a
good cream highlight so for the lower
lash line when I grab that transition
shade I love when I try to do a makeup
tutorial and all my brushes
so I put some liner in the waterline and
then I like to take a little brush and I
put it like right there at the base of
my lashes and then I'm going to take
this little brush and just buff it out
so it's like way softer for lips I'm
gonna mix together two colors I have I'm
colour-pop white WYD what you doin and
then I also have the color pop midnight
snack so I'm gonna put one kinda like on
the outer corners of my lips and then
I'm gonna put the other one in this
Center guys look at the highlight oh my
goodness okay this is the finished look
I love the way it came out I love the
eyes the foundation is probably one of
my favorite parts of the look I think it
looks so beautiful and cool covered this
look I love it and it's so affordable it

thing I used was affordable so I hope
