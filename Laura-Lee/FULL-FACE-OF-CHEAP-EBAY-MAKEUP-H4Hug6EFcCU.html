today's video I'm like half asleep
someone welcome Oh daddy's video is eBay
make if I ordered a bunch stuff off eBay
and I made sure it wasn't things that I
have used before like these random
little eBay brands my sister and see how
the makeup is it's a good is it crap
also if you guys remember on my channel
a while back me enjoy yourself I test
out the derma coal foundation and I
bought a fake off eBay so this time I
wanted to try the real one and so I
scoured eBay for like the most expensive
one to buy and hopes that it's real I
don't know if this is the real one I
don't really know how to tell but I
think it is the row one so now I can
actually see with the world's most full
coverage foundation it's gonna look make
one quick announcement real quickly we
can around a mediocre I let the
lipsticks are back in stock they are 16
bucks apiece or you can get the bundle
where that that is 38 and you save $10
it would be 48 if you bought them all
individually but if you get the bundle
you'll save 10 bucks that's gonna be
back and start on Monday alright it's
time to jump into the video and quit
rambling laura-leigh I will see you guys
on the other side of this transition
okay guys we're gonna jump right in
first I'm gonna get tied to stop
sniffing my makeup I'm gonna get him to
zoom in the camera so you guys can see
more here we go put my hair up obviously
I don't know why I like to narrate every
single thing I do in my videos but y'all
know that's just the team I like to tell
you every little thing that's going on
so going into this makeup it's mostly
from China it's really really really
affordable on there I found like really
cheap things and I make sure everything
I bought would ship within like a few
days because sometimes you order stuff
on there and then three months later you
get it you're like that might just be me
though the first thing I'm gonna try out
is this primer all from City color it
literally just looks like grease sniffer
easy just kidding
trick James really thought it was
burning my skin oh okay I'm rubbing it
in and it just feels very old a figure I
can use this my face primer today you
guys know I cannot talk if smells are
around my nose or powder because then
I'm just like I don't not like it it
feels very moisturizing good I forgot to
sing the SUBSCRIBE song let's see him
right now be sure and subscribe to my
channel yeah
if you aren't subscribed then you
haven't joined the lordly fam and I need
you to go ahead and do that okay thank
you
let's have a derma Kol and I'm gonna use
my y6 brush from morphe you can use code
larlie at checkout save yo some money
and for fast shipping I don't know I
just added that last part now I know a
little bit goes a long way this one
already fills from what I remember this
one already feels a little bit better
than the other one I think I may have
gotten the real stuff okay yeah I
definitely think I got the real stuff
because the one last time
which girl this ain't my color but it
literally it was just like grease but it
wasn't covering anything girl this could
cover definitely a tattoo and I just put
this is like barely a pea-sized amount
that I'm leaning out right now I
probably got the real one yeah
oh I wish it wasn't this light but I
ordered like the darkest one they had
and this in the real one section or
whatever I could definitely see this
getting in my small minds real quick but
I'm a full coverage Queen right now good
love about this literally the world's
cheapest contour palette or concealer
palette do I really need concealer at
this point Jesus I'm gonna add a little
bit of the contour on and then I'm just
gonna blend it out I have a morphe m33 4
brush so I'm just gonna take this little
shade and maybe a little bit of this oh
my god where is the color girl we're
gonna have to go to the darker shades
because this like oddly enough isn't
really having any pigment
okay that one has a little bit of
pigment this is a weird palette whenever
I wear makeup that's literally this
heavy no matter how much I said it I
feel like it just because it's like so
heavy
it just doesn't last long at all it
starts to get cakey looking skin just
like rejects it and I do wear I'm a full
coverage point but I'm talking about
like some derma Col some thick cream
contour like I feel like this contour
has more grease to it than it does
actual pigment in the product so I
wouldn't recommend this palette even
though it is really affordable like mass
will save your dollar dollar bill you
and I spin it somewhere else like on a
gumball machine or something I'm not
knocking the foundation because you have
to remember that foundation is really
for like studio where and stuff like
that I'm like TV we're covering tattoos
like art not for like yeah everyday girl
so next up I got this contour kit from
poof I don't know what that is but I'm
not going to touch it I got this contour
kit for profusion I've never used
perfume makeup before but they are sold
at the drugstore and the kid looked
really cute it's got some brushes with
it the brushes look cute to you I'm
gonna actually go ahead and set all this
makeup I'm gonna add this on my under
eye and then these two shades I'll
probably mix and add them to set the
contour don't ever forget if you add a
cream to your face a powder needs to go
on top because it's just gonna slip and
slide around like a slipper slide okay
so I'm gonna take my morphe sponge this
one's already been dampened I'm gonna
get some of this like banana powder on
it girl we're gonna set it and forget it
just kidding we can't forget because we
have to wipe off some of this today
she's gonna have a hard time today the
makeup gods are gonna challenge me I say
bring it on
I just wanna say this one I'm taking on
as much makeup as I can thank you guys
for like being on my channel thank you
for being subscribers and loyal viewers
and I really appreciate that and I
appreciate the most because you guys
like allowed me and encouraged me to be
myself and you love the most genuine me
that you can get and you know I'm just
glad that you love a version of me that
is me
and not some crazy version of me that's
like fake you guys encouraged my
weirdness and I appreciate that because
like not many places in the world do
they encourage you to be am i trying to
open this up right now with scissors do
they encourage you to be a weirdo but
here they do and I encourage you to be a
little strange and sometimes if I read
your comments and you guys are hilarious
like you are you do you guys encourage
the humor you encourage the weirdness
and I encourage it back like I read your
comments you guys are freaking hole are
us I'm gonna go in with this little
contour brush that came in the kit it
feels like very not dense and flimsy and
the contour powder already feels like
very like dusty it's flinging everywhere
because I got too much on this cheek I'm
just going to take my sponge and try to
dab that out okay let's talk about the
globe palette I ordered this one on eBay
and I'm kind of like is this is what I
ordered because I feel like it
definitely looked different online like
but then what actually came in the mail
it just looks like a cloudy day inside
of the palette it looks so gray I'm like
depressed like mm-hmm
all the colors come off pretty much
white they're kind of going for the
iridescent theme but I will say this a
lot of pigment comes off I'm gonna take
a little highlight brush and the problem
is I feel like all these are gonna be so
light on me girl
so I'll try this one over here called
precious
and I think it actually is really pretty
I had to go in with such a light Hanks I
feel like this kid just gonna be too
light but in the profusion kit I just
want to try out this golden shade and
see what happens so we can give two
highlighters a test run okay that is so
much better like just for my skin see
that glow that's definitely more like it
honey I actually really like this
highlighter in the profusion kit I just
feel like the other ones are just too
great for me and at the end of the day
they don't end up looking that saucy
actually like this helic has a lot of
art contour excuse me contour kit is a
little bit powdery dusty and has a lot
of fallout but like the actual contour
in highlighters I mean they work so I
kind of like this I mean you just kind
of have to get past like the dust
explosion but once you do it doesn't
really look that bad you're picking up
what I'm putting down
or blush I did pick up a full blush
palette it was very affordable it's my
beauty treats matte blush palette now
again when I order it online I don't
remember the colors being this bright I
don't remember being like but this color
looks so pretty in the palette so we do
have a color I'm gonna take it e4 which
is my favorite blush brush and I'm just
gonna okay pigmentation key is to go in
with a light hand and I'm just gonna
take my sponge and dab that out because
again I just put on too much
unfortunately like I wouldn't use any of
these colors I would use this one this
one in this one but it's a cute palette
I mean it just depends on like how
bright you like to go with your blood
the tea is I bought this little beauty
creations irresistible palette I feel
like everything on eBay looks so great
and do you get it you're like also got a
brow pencil drawing eyebrow by etude
house which is that brand they had like
a bunch of stores standalone eetu stores
in Japan but then everybody's like
that's a Korean brand we're gonna test
oh honey so far so good
I mean I like the brow pencil it's
working very well for me definitely like
the brow pencil so we definitely have a
win here I think my blush is so heavy
today
eyebrows are on next I'm gonna go into
this palette first I'm just going to go
in with naked and this just softens up
the primer or concealer that I have now
I'm actually gonna go in my eBay account
and see what I paid for this palette so
I think that would be really interesting
I paid nine dollars for the blush
palette nine dollars for the highlight
palette six books for my lashes I pay 17
bucks for the dermal call or this
palette I paid 10 bucks not to shop
everything I got was really cheap but
not the derma Kohl because I wanted to
pay more for that in hopes that I got
the real thing and I definitely feel
like I got the real thing I'm gonna take
an hour 39 brush this is one of my
favorite medium sized blenders I'm gonna
go in with bare the palette definitely
has like a load of fallout every time
every time you get a shade it like
explodes color everywhere I'm gonna tap
into tender kiss next I mean these are
just they're a little bit difficult to
work with I'm not gonna lie I take a
clean brush and go in with kiss me which
is our pinky matte shade
I am going to actually put some
concealer down I will say the Matt so
far is my review of the palette seem so
dry they definitely a pigment to it but
because of how like dusty and dry there
are it's really makes it just difficult
to blend them if I take a little m41
brush and I like to use these brushes to
pack on I showed it to the eyelid I'm
going to take true love I'm gonna give
it the spritz of holy mac cosmetics fix
plus the shimmers look nice okay it
seems like the matte is the real issue
in this palette but the shimmer seem to
be really nice however there are only
one two three three shimmers in this
palette and now that the more that I'm
looking at this palette you know what
this palette looks like to me it looks
like a modern renaissance but I will say
I think you'll definitely get way better
quality in the modern renaissance
palette versus is this one girl cuz this
one's a little bit on the dry side she
needs some moisturizer I'm now gonna go
in with yours on a tinier brush just to
deepen up this outer corner a bit I'm
gonna take my M 250 liner brush and do a
little bit of liner I just really feel
like this look needs like some liner
just winging it really gives the look a
little bit more like I'm actually gonna
go back in with a dark brown shade and
with like a little angled brush I just
wanted to find this cut crease just like
a touch more did by these lashes and
they actually came in and looked pretty
good like they look like super dramatic
ones but like I'm here for it so I
played six bucks for the lashes get five
pair lashes so that's like a dollar and
some change for a lash and I think I'm
gonna like home hi there I like them
they're dramatic the drama they bring
the drama mama so I am here for the
lashes and then it even comes through
like a little lid for them so I'm
actually gonna keep those and use them
for sure I'm gonna add a little bit of
eyeshadow to my under eye of course so
I'll just go back in with bare and
probably like this warm toned Brown and
just dust it on the inner eye it is time
for me to remove my concealer lips and
apply a lip e I did buy these colorful
lippies I can't remember I think there's
mystery color-changing so I'm gonna try
this blue one well it's moisturizing oh
it's turning no it's not I don't know I
also bought this is attorney I also
don't like this gold lippy from glitter
lips
I don't live for it but I don't I don't
hate it I think it could be a really
cute lib topper all right guys that is
it for this video I that I should have
palate like hood get a good look out of
it I shouldn't work really hard for it
because the shadows are very dry I
probably won't use it again
I like the blush palette I just wish the
colors weren't so like neon almost too
pigmented if that is a thing I did like
the contour kid and the lips are cute I
wish I would have bought more of like a
liquid lipstick or more of a pigmented
lipstick I think I thought the toefl
lipsticks we're gonna turn more like
color changing the gold was kind of cool
like I said lip topper the dimmer caught
actually looks pretty good and the
concealer a little concealer kit it was
just I was awesome definitely hit and
miss products but hey we had some hits
for a very affordable price so I hope
