channel today's video is going to be me
using kind of a full face of color pop
makeup the I think color pop doesn't
have is setting powder and foundation
have concealer eyeliners different lip
products blush highlight it's bronzers
and of course eyes shadow so I'm gonna
be using all those in today's video I
love color pop and I think they have a
ton of great stuff so yeah I figured I
would do a little toot-toot using all
their stuff you love these be sure and
subscribe to my channel
baba yeah Lee subscribe I have no
announcements do I have any
announcements okay well then we'll just
jump right in dang this is the world
short is intro should I just keep
talking to make it long no ok we get
started
my face right before get started so well
I also used the colour-pop concealer
right here to prime my eyelids let's
just talk about this so my nose well
like caca in this video and I am going
to be going to the nail salon at
approximately an hour and 30 minutes so
they'll look better in an hour and
thirty minutes but for this video I just
they don't look good okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and do my face makeup with the
concealer now I really love colour-pop
concealers I'm using the shade light and
they are a whopping six dollars and they
have this really thick whipped full
coverage formula I also like the
applicator on them they're nice I'm
gonna just use my y6 brush to blend this
out also I obviously started with
foundation on because there's no such
thing as a color pop foundation but I
think color pop needs to come out with
the foundation cuz I'll be waiting on it
because their faith products have been
so nice I'm like okay where's that
foundation now what do you guys think so
I'm gonna go ahead and set my under eye
I apologize that I don't have those
products but as soon as they make them
honey I will be using them in a tutorial
I'm gonna start with that all I see is
magic palette which I love this palette
and I told you guys I would do it look
with it so I'm gonna start with this
peachy shade right here and this is it
in 573 a blender and I'm just gonna pop
this shade in the crease it's a really
nice peachy shade to help lighten up the
primer and it's also a great transition
shade it's very light with the r39 I'm
gonna go into this warmer color right
here I'm just gonna work that in the
crease a little bit not taking it to too
low such a pretty color
this is actually a Smith 203 brush and
I'm gonna take this purpley shade and
I'll mix it with a little bit of the
brown together and then because this
brush is a little bit more defining I'm
gonna just pop that right into the upper
crease area try and really not to hit
the eyelid with it because you know I
don't want a purple explosion although
it does a little goes a long way
guys these eyeshadows are so creamy and
like the matte are phenomenal I just
mixed the purple and brown together and
just really work it in the crease and I
drug it out really far but I'm gonna go
and like sweep that away and clean it up
in just a second I'm gonna take a little
bit of shiny which is my very own eye
shadow from colour-pop on that same
brush and just a reminder 100% of the
proceeds for my collection with color
pop girl goes to the animal shelter
which is amazing
you can go back to your fluffy blender
and you can even it like soften up those
edges if you feel like they're getting a
little bit harsh no worries there I just
go back and soften them up time to cut
the crease and one of my favorite brush
to do that is the important one and I'm
gonna be taking the colour-pop concealer
and they'll show you light I like to get
a little bit on the back of my hand
hello focus and then I'll get some on
both sides of the brush like see that I
love how like you see that and you guys
are like we can't respond to you okay
and then I'm gonna carve out the crease
so I start by getting the excess off the
brush and then I don't have to tug your
eye I just hold on to my eye to make
sure it doesn't run away anywhere you
know and then because this brush goes
like that rounded edge I'm able to kinda
cut that crease now you can leave it
like that or you can drag it on out
so now I'm going to take this little
cloth and just wipe away that excess
we'll make up wipe I'm going to take it
III brush and just sweep away the excess
setting powder that I apply down but we
have a nice cut crease and now what I'm
going to do is go back in with another
shade from this palette you kind of want
to do this pink shade I'm like I don't
wanna do the gold or pink I'm gonna go
with the lighter pink now I'm just
slightly gonna pack this on my eyelid
with the same m41 brush
by the way that is the lit color and now
I'm gonna use this color on the brow
bone and the inner cup inner corner
counter just lit for when I mess up
words I don't know why I just think it
is just the greatest some people do not
like it okay this little pencil brush is
a t-34 it's one of my favorite pencil
brushes I'm using here right now we're
actually gonna dip into a really pretty
color eyeliner this is called best zero
it's one of their gel pots and it's like
a maroon e brown color kind of like that
busted fingernail right there and it's
gonna really pretty with the look we did
I'm gonna use a em 250 - one little
liner brush and their gel liners are
very nice liners they're super
affordable which is amazing and that my
friends creates like this really pretty
kind of cut crease look now if you
wanted to deepen the cut crease a little
more you can even take it in five in
five one five and take your darkest
color which in our case was shiny I'm so
close up but you can just pop it right
there the crease to define the little
cut crease a little bit more and this is
only if you want to define it more
popped on a lash and now I'm gonna go
ahead and work on the lower lash line
and then we'll finish our face makeup
but for the lower lash line we'll take
em to Tennant brush and go in weeds this
warmer shade and I'll probably mix it
with the purple I'm gonna put some that
colour-pop liner just right into a key
waterline I'm going to take this color
pop bronzer and highlighter set and I'm
gonna use the bronzer side which is such
a pretty bronzer gonna take out our 14
bronzer brush
I love that bronzer but this is
highlighter but actually I'm gonna use
it as a blush if you can see it's a
really pretty peachy shade I'm gonna
take a wipe or blush brush it has like
shimmer too but I just think it's so
pretty because it definitely pitch like
a lot of peach on the cheek you could
definitely use it as a highlighter
though if you want it to but instead for
a highlighter I'm just using all the
magic collection that I'm going to use
this highlighter that doesn't have a
name on the bottom of it my first time
trying there loose highlighters let's
see what happens is it magic
we don't know yes I realize color
problem doesn't have mascara either so
it's trying to do a full face color pop
and they didn't any products get a plus
forever because we use a lot of color
pop for my lips I'm gonna use none other
than BAM my very own creation because I
think it looks really pretty with the
eye
this is the final look I hope you guys
liked this tutorial I wanted to do it to
show you guys some looks with the magic
palette cuz I talked about it but I
never used to know my channel and also
to share with you guys some good color
pop makeup maybe thee I know like
because I brought websites sometimes
overwhelming because they have so much
stuff but these are few products that I
love from colour-pop and they work
really well and the best part is they're
very affordable makeup so yeah you get
you get your bang for your buck the
loose highlight who basically this is
just a full face as much as I could
possibly get two of my color pop
favorites I love you guys thank you so
much for watching and I hope to see you
all in my next video be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
