like this smells dangerous like I
literally have no idea what the hell I
just sprayed on my face hey guys what's
up and welcome to my channel today's
video is one that I've never done on my
channel before because today I'm gonna
be testing out fake makeup I went
downtown LA and also on eBay and I got a
bunch of makeup that is remade and is
the fake thing it's not real makeup and
also just so you guys know the cat's
pajamas palette is on eBay and there's a
lot of fake ones out there so just
beware and I've gotten a lot of emails
to people being like this doesn't look
like your palette I got off eBay and I'm
like it's fake and that's like a waste
of money guys so I'm gonna test the fake
makeup out a lot of it I did get
downtown LA I saw James Charles do this
on his channel so shout out to James
check out his video it's really awesome
and he just test out guys I got like
Naked palette I got my very own viola
boss palette this is a fake palette guys
I got the jaclyn hill morphe i got Kylie
i got like a full face of stuff I got
foundations concealers bronzers
highlighters brow products everything I
have my tryouts also in today's video
there is going to be a giveaway I told

that I'm doing and as you guys know all

giveaway all you have to do is check the
description box down below all the
information is done in the description
box I'm gonna stop right now
hey okay so without further ado let's
sing the little subscribe song so we can
get into this fake make up fake up well
let's fake up now we're calling it be
sure subscribe
oh yeah week subscribe now let's go
ahead and jump right into the video
you guys see the white fuzz at the
bottom of screen is my mirror sorry it's
just like a tiny bit too tall so let's
go ahead and get started I've already
moisturized my skin and I think we
should start with foundation so I
actually got to fake foundations and the
first one is the honest I'll show
Beverly Hills they look so real tell me
that doesn't look real I mean the box is
clearly like they've been beaten and
abused and I've done nothing to the
boxes and also I am skeptical in the
shades because I'm an NC 35 and Mac and
all they had was NC 40 but yet NC 40
would be way too dark for me and it
looks like it's going to be my shade
also this is a brand new bottle and if
you can tell it's clearly not filled to
the top so this is a phony foundation so
I don't know how I'll be able to use
this one today actually from the anasazi
Beverly Hills foundation but packaging
what feels nice and heavy and it looks
like it could be real I don't know let's
test it out it feels thick though like
it feels like a Mac foundation I gotta
say it's how you guys not to do this at
home because let me be real with you we
don't know what chemicals are in this
makeup because clearly it's like
illegally technically illegally made
makeup so we don't we don't know what's
in it um okay so I'm gonna take my
wife's expression morphe it's my
favorite foundation brush it's a real
brush it's not fake and I'm gonna go
ahead and stipple this out and why is it
like not that bad
why do I feel like the formula is
somewhat similar to the Mack formula so
now I'm going to actually take the a BH
one and I'm gonna utilize it and because
it's such a light shade it feels pretty
look how thick that is I'm gonna use it
like a concealer and highlight my face
interesting interesting interesting
we're gonna take the zach same brush and
just blend that out yes darling what do
you guys feel about pony make up like a
pig make up like how do you guys feel
about it do you guys feel like it's a
huge no-no do you guys feel like hey
everybody's gotta make a dollar they got
to do what they can do um I always
sympathize you know because I feel like
people aren't selling I don't know I'm
in between I don't really want to say my
part because I don't want to get an
argument people to argue online but I
always have this sympathy for people who
are in need and you know they're not
selling it because it's their goal in
life they're selling it because they
need money so you feel bad but then the
same time you feel bad for the companies
who invest it and worked really hard
creating these products and they get
ripped off and lose money off the fake
sell so and I know the money most of
these companies are multi-billion dollar
companies but a company like my own and
cat's pajamas has already been remade
and I don't know you just it's a weird
feeling because you're just like no
that's not fair to the company you know
within I don't know so we are feeling
and you don't know what chemicals are in
this makeup either that it's even safe
so there's that as well I'm gonna take a
white 11 brush my apologies I could not
find a loose setting powder for my life
downtown or on ebay that was fake they
had some on eBay but they looked very
real and um I was like no I don't want
to buy like a real one on accident and
say it's fake because you don't want to
mess up so I was like I'll just use my
own setting powder while my pace is
setting I actually got a fake on Sasha
Beverly Hills brow definer you know I
see that packaging it looks pretty real
huh I got to say it shade soft brown but
the label looks like a pukey yellow
color which is obviously not ABH the top
ones the fake one the bottom ones the
real one so I can definitely
that it's fake I mean the colors way off
the shape of the pencil is just a little
bit different as well this is a real
college interweb set I am just using it
for the mirror so the color looks like
this red Auburn so I'm scared for my
eyebrows right now except that's just
not gonna be right oh boy let's do this
okay
that is so bad it's a flop oh oh my god
like how can I even feel my eyebrow with
this this is like the color of red dirt
in Alabama now you know not to buy fake
brow pencils with his you'll just end up
with crazy eyebrows like this is the
biggest flop ever like I can fill in my
eyebrows with this I just want to share
with you guys some of the fake palettes
I got this is the vacation palette from
Kylie it's a lot smaller than the
original palette and then I got the
naked heat it slides out but the palette
is so funny-looking
the colors are actually gorgeous on the
inside of the palette but the palette
literally just looks so fake like not
even close I got the Jacqueline Hill
palette but these are all faded I think
they've been setting out in the Sun for
too long or else the screen printing
which is not done very well well they
got the new shiny packaging okay and
then it does look super similar but like
colors over here and even this color
it's not the same color as the one in
her palette larlie Belle boss this is
the exact same unicorn I bought it and I
literally was checking out and I was
like I hope she doesn't realize that
that's me right there and she didn't
here is the palette it's pretty much the
exact same except for again like it's
the same but some of the colors are off
on fleek ease off this one isn't really
a duochrome but it's very similar I give
it to him it's similar
I bought the Maine EMU a palette which
is hilarious I need to know who is that
man you don't look like you
and the palates similar is really
lightweight though and then the color
super pink on it and I I think meny
actually swatched these because he came
to my house it was like what but yeah
the clothes are super similar and close
but they're definitely not exact and I
got the brand-new morphe 35o to like the
second one the old more feet logo on it
though and Morpheus a new logo going on
now and yeah the colors are extremely
similar guys so needless to say I just
like saw the eyeshadow palettes now it's
just like oh my god I just like went in
I just excited and we are weirdly
excited I'm gonna take an m5 3/5 brush
and I think I'm gonna use this morphe
palette remember this is not the real
palette though so remember that I'm
gonna take this first shade in the
corner oh oh you know what I'm not gonna
use this guys it smells so strong like a
dangerous chemical like it smells like
like so strong it like almost wants to
give me a headache like I don't want to
put this on my eyes like this smells
dangerous slightly throwing it in the
trash oh my god I dip my brush in it
when the powder started mixing it like
kicked up in my face and I was like HM
this one doesn't so I'm gonna take Chris
Pot my eye is missing tomorrow this is
no joke Oh watch my eyes start watering
so I'm taking Priss pot and I'm just
gonna blend this within 5 3 5 brush and
this just helps soften up I put down a
little bit of that foundation as my
eyeshadow primer I don't know what we
bout to do about the brows I mean I
think we should all vote I just fill
them in normally at the end but I'm
going to take breeches next
this is so weird like using a palette
that's not even mine
but it is mine and I don't know how I
feel about it the colors are not
terrible you know they're blending
they're pressed way harder than what we
pressed my volleyball colors so I'll say
that like they're pressed very hard for
some reason I feel like my eyes are
gonna start watering
I'm gonna take my r39 brush in the shade
fried but it's blending out you know I
don't know I feel like these colors are
really decent but they're just like
slightly patchy I don't know if that's
just me and it's like in my head I don't
know I'm gonna take Alabama which
strangely has like a nick in it that I
don't recall putting in it um and I'm
also using the same r39 brush and I'm
just packing these colors on that outer
corner I'm honestly like just moreso
playing with all the colors to see if
they anything this has no pigment almost
Alabama has literally like no pigment to
it but I don't even know what look I'm
doing I'm just playing with these colors
because I want to just see and explore
and see what happens with them I'm gonna
switch over and grab this red shade cuz
I just want to see their press so hard
compared to the original palettes
meaning whatever machine pressed these
in the pan they press them hard and this
color has a little bit of pigment but
not nearly as much as the original
palette this one smells slightly
chemically but not the kind of camo
coolsex like my eyes gonna fall out with
like the other morphe palette i got
literally scared me i really want to try
out this darker purple maybe from the
Naked heat palette I don't know let's
see what happens
it's muddy looking and I don't care for
it at all I mean it had some pigment
they came off but it just is so patchy
and muddy looking I don't like it so I'm
going to go in and try this more of a
neutral color like a bronze okay that's
way better so whoever made Jaclyn hill
palette did a little bit of a better job
I'm gonna dip into this color with the M
210 brush I feel like my eyes look kind
of messy and I'm sorry for that guys I
just honestly wanted to play with a lot
of colors and just see what happens this
brown has no pigment to it obviously not
loving my eye look but that's okay we're
gonna make the best of it and I'm gonna
try out this huda beauty a false lash
effect
who'da doesn't even have this product
this is just like a randomly made
product with dust on it that she didn't
even it doesn't even exist first it
comes with a pencil liner and the pencil
black liner says eyebrow pencil which
doesn't make any sense to me
it comes with a liquid liner and a
mascara let's trap the liner and see
what happens it's a stiff felt tip up
tip applicator if you can see it's like
super like a rock which is not typically
what I do my eyeliner with ever
pliner's like very sticky and shiny you
guys know I hate this shiny liner but I
mean it's really black the mascara is
pretty gosh-darn decent besides the fact
I coated my finger in it somehow like
it's super sticky but it's like lifting
my lashes like no other like oh my gosh
this mascara oh my god it's good I like
it
next I'll mix these two shades together
for my under eye I also got this fake a
BH kit off of ebay and I actually have
this one for a long time because I
wanted to film something with it
out of like a year um but I've never
used it it's just been swatched and like
setting around so I'm going to take it
in this color little looks great by the
way but I'm going to take a m58 one
brush I'll mix these two shades together
it's like barely anything's coming off
I really hate my look today and I'm sad
I feel like I was just trying out colors
just to see like how they worked and
because some of them were so patchy like
it did a rout oh my god this is like
sticking to my forehead like glue for
highlighter I got a knock up of the glow
kit and mood child by a BH this is
probably the cheapest piece I found it
feels terrible I'm super just flimsy
lightweight I'm gonna take this yellow
shade Lucky Clover oh my why is it
actually so pretty I mean no doubt like
this color did not turn out the yellowy
color it turned out kind of chalky cuz
if you look at me straight on like it's
it's too light looks chalky but it's
actually like super pretty like sideways
if my skin was lighter like this would
really work for me oh my god why is it
so glowy okay so I'm gonna take the
purple shade now oh it's pretty look at
all my fake lippies eye God the Tarte
one obviously looks the fakest I'm gonna
try the Smashbox one because it looks so
real like the packaging looks so real
but I gotta say it's super super
lightweight the actual Smashbox ones are
not lightweight so yeah I'm gonna try on
this color the dope foots the same as
the socks line fortunately this feels
just like a lip gloss okay and last but
certainly not least I got a mac fix+
spray and the packaging I mean the box
is beat up but it's super similar to the
actual mac fix+ spray box so I'm gonna
spray on its it smells like hairspray oh
my god it's like I literally have no
idea what the hell I just sprayed on my
face
like it's actually like the exact same
bottle but the fake one is like a
different color and this one's like I
don't know like I know the specific
smell mac fix+ and that's not a spelling
mac fix flies Oh throwing that in trash
I'm never gonna spray that on my face
again it just scares me because I've no
idea was all right guys that is it for
this video all I did is went on and
added some brows with my normal brow
pencil I mean and the lips did dry down
completely I was wrong on that but the
formula is definitely something
different it doesn't smell or apply like
the liquid lipsticks from Smashbox the
makeup you know it's not the end of the
world like this doesn't look horrendous
it doesn't but just me comparing to
using the real thing in the past like
it's not the same thing it's not the
same formulas and I don't know what's in
this makeup but my eyes balls right here
I could claw them off of my foot right
there
that feels so good I'm gonna wash my
face really soon I just wanted to do
this for the makeup to try it out and
see the T on it they're selling millions
worth of fake makeup every year and you
know it scares me a little bit
okay now I'm itching and now it might be
in my head because it started itching
