today's video is going to be testing out
basically okay here fatigue I had a
bunch of products to test out separately
like do the Kylie Jenner review it does
the colors review this weird shaky
mascara review all different videos
ain't got time to film all different
video so I'm just put it all in the one
I figured we would just do one of my
first impressions makeup tutorials and
kind of just try it all out into one
video so I partnered up with gloss here
to test our new Wilder this is a brand
new powders they just came out with and
I am really excited to test it out today
also have the milk company so I will be
test no nose makeup for y'all and we'll
see the tea on it I'm excited for
today's video
oh my god my hair hello I was like
there's something else I was gonna tell
them what is it that looks in the
viewfinder on my oh so as you can tell
we lightened up my hair like crazy oh my
gosh I'm super excited about it we got
some like really ashy pieces in there
and then we got some bronzy pieces it's
like a fun mix I might keep changing it
up I don't know let me know what you
guys think I don't know if you remember
before my hair it's pretty much all dark
with a little bit of a early ombre I
like not too ombre and then I was
clipping my extensions I have on
extensions right now to keep my hair
flowing but yeah I lined it a whole
bunch and I'm really excited about it
before you leave make sure you pull my
channel oh yeah subscribe and we'll go
ahead and jump right in and get started
okay guys the first product I'm going to
be trying out today is the elf glow
lotion neutral now this is a fresh
glowing hydrating moisturizing lotion
called glow lotion it hydrates the skin
with illuminating effect so this is just
going to be my moisturizer that's a die
it it looks white on train but it's
purple oh it's kind of thick always get
hesitant it's definitely kind of
luminizing let's keep it moving and see
what else happens with it it smells
really luxurious like it smells
expensive
maybe just me being crazy but I think
it's all fixed so I like you don't know
what that expensive smell is my old life
you smell something you're like that
smells experienced actually I'm just
going to add a little bit of this I
don't know why I'm using the sample size
but the associate it's a long little
primer I don't know if I said that right
it's by YSL and I've been liking this
stuff I'm just going to add a dot where
my pores are a little bit annoying and
this is just going to help prime of skin
I just like to massage it in there maybe
a little on the forehead too and this
really helps the blur factor now I'm
excited to try this out as my I keep
reaching for it this is the matte
foundation by milk make with excuse me
my mails makeup it is the assist be like
a blur moment for me here this one is in
shade honey
just shake it up shake it up shake it up
please be my shade because it could be a
little bit warmth for me but that's okay
because my body is a lot darker than my
face so today I'm going to apply it with
my web brush let's sing it together
so what sticks amalfi okay I found it I
couldn't find it for a minute panic okay
okay I think this is going to be my
shade I'm gonna move my mirror a little
closer so I can feel it actually
happening on my face yeah this is a
little bit warm for me but I think
that's okay just first impressions
putting it on I don't hate it
first off though is going to be thicker
it's a little bit shiny but that it says
it's a matte foundation and that might
dry down because I did just apply it 20
here is the finished look it doesn't
look very matte on me it does have some
coverage it doesn't feel that heavy on
my skin I still don't hate it it has a
little bit of luminosity happen in my
pores on looking that blurred but I feel
like I need a way just to suck in like
see how it settles on my skin so let's
just keep the video moving along now I
have another product you guys are going
to be super excited for me to try out
and it is the color pop new concealers
this is called the no filter concealer
and they came out with a bun
new shades in it is what the little
component looks like I'm going to be
trying out shade light neutral lit look
how creamy that looks they did come out
with those little concealer and contour
sticks in the past that didn't work out
for me to shave maybe just a touch too
light but we weren't we already gone in
and that's okay you blend it now it
feels really thick and creamy it feels
luxurious I literally oh let's put a
little bit right there right on my face
okay cool local in for three years I'm
going to hit the Beauty Blender with a
little bit of setting spray
so far they blend out so easy for as
creamy and stick as they are I see just
a little bit of darkness still which
isn't too bad that's about normal for
concealer girl they can all cover my
dark bags you can see like it's blending
out like so easy with the speaking
blender the real question is how is it
going to wear it looks pretty with this
foundation I feel like I mean it's a
little light I know but I feel like it
looks pretty and the foundation is
looking pretty good alright so we'll see
how that wears to the end of the video
and if you didn't know I also put little
descriptions on how things were
throughout the day because I know I test
out so many products in the videos I put
it in the description box so check it
out that out too now I'm excited to test
out the welder no lie I've already
tested out this product and I like it
one little key thing with this guy right
here it's not really for baking it's
more for just applying it you can apply
it in specific areas or you can apply it
all over your face and set your makeup
so it comes with a little spongy thing
in there and you just tap your brush
hello and you can just change that you
can just tap your brush in there so if
they give a real skin finish look it's
also supposed to mattify your skin
completely but yet at the same time
letting your skin breathe which who
doesn't want that here's a little brush
to use with it this is a glossy air
brush this is when the powders I love
because it's not too translucent and
this gives you the illusion of being
poor free and I've really been enjoying
it so again you don't want to get too
much on your brush and you just want to
kind of you can put it all over I'm
really going to set this concealer with
it so velvety this product truly if you
have larger pores and you're really not
into taking it on like you just want to
set your pretty little face this might
just happen and then softly rubbing
we'll do a close-up of my poor areas
that were not looking too great and I'll
show you how they're already mattified
also you're not going to get it
flashback from this product and it comes
in three sheer shades and I'm going to
use the light/medium today but they also
have a deep dark and shade rich can guys
see how my pores are way
or mad and blurred the skin looks soft
compared to before just looks smaller so
there you have it really been enjoying
that product again not really for baking
but more for just like setting and
really modifying the face next I'm going
to try out this new bronzer called Palm
Island from CIPA this is new and talking
so she loves it so I'm excited to see if
I love it
talk to you normally dead on I'm going
to use an m5 8:1 brush okay so far a lot
of product comes off easily so you get a
lot of color and pigmentation so far and
as you can see it just this one's a
little bit warm toned very pretty though
this one doesn't have any glitter or
sparkle in it at all so it just looks on
my whole look is kind of going Matt
today and I think that's awesome you
know I love a good matte look but um Raj
is really beautiful right now just
coming flown with look I like how it's
applying to I feel like its own applying
really smooth I'm not getting patchiness
from it I feel like it's pretty even so
okay see okay I'm digging the bronzer
for sure for blush I'm going to use this
new and from dose of colors this is
called statement and it's from their
collection their little mint collection
here's a swatch of pool of it looks
really pretty and matte - everything's
just mad I think I'm going to take a
white one brush ooh
so much pigmentation segments head these
are subtle - let's see oh there's some
color
I'm very pretty very matte I'm a sucker
for a good peachy pink blush I kind of
did a lot there next I'm going to go
ahead and this is this one they use
today I think this will amaze today I'm
like looking around make sure there's
nothing else here I'm going to use the
one at all birthday collection palette
them from Kylie Jenner here it is I'm
going to try out her birthday shade for
my highlight today and then we'll hop
onto the eyes I might take it inside pin
brush oh my god I just picked up way too
much I know it's pretty but as you can
see like sparkle can explode everywhere
it's a little dusty
but this is a brush swatch so very
pigmented it's pretty things are really
working out for me today yeah it's
definitely pigmented but DC is a very
glittery and dusty do you cut might want
to spritz it with some spray first which
can I go ahead and do girl we got
sparkles plan I put on my brows and I
also went ahead and prime my eyelids
with a Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre that
I always use now I'm going to take a e27
brush and I'm going to take buttercream
frosting which is this neutral shade
right here I like going over my
eyeshadow primer with a neutral shade it
just helps soften it up so that way the
other colors they blend so much easier
if you do this I'm telling you it's like
a life-saving trick you ever Philip
crumb on meros mess up you ever feel
like your eyeshadows are sticking to
your primer too much you can hit it with
the chances and powder or just like a
cream colored eyeshadow I'm going to
take some party time on an R 39 brush
these are a lot of pigment and medium
amount of Fallout which is what I
typically opt for I don't like as you
guys on my review of the a BH structure
palette or structure I keep on in strips
your palette I'd be making it worth my
head y'all not destructure palette D
subculture palette it just had too much
fallout for me so this one I feel like
it's a good medium amount of fallout so
I like that I don't like when shadows
have a zero claw because I feel - I'm
like girl I can't get any pigment off
you know so I'm really focusing this
color right here in the crease and kind
of just pushing it back and forth all
over I really want to have a pink moment
because this is like a pink themed
palette so I am taking this color up a
little bit higher it was a little bit
more pink than I thought but that's okay
I think it's going to be really pretty
I'm just blending it with the r39 right
here and then I'll just take whatever is
left from the outer edge and just start
to work it inward like
that back and forth I'm going to have a
bold moment grab a little bit of this
hot pink but I'm literally going to be
like just on the tip and then I'm going
to focus it right in that crease but I'm
going to keep this color way lower than
I did the first color
I'm going to take it em four to five
brush and take forever young pretty
matte pink color I'm just going to pop
it right there going to keep the lid a
little bit lighter pink you can see a
lot of color comes off with a shadow but
there's not too much fallout from really
enjoying that I'm just packing this on
it's good to you synthetic packing brush
whenever you do your lid whether it's a
matte or shimmer it really cuts down on
the fallout and helps you just to press
it in to your eyelid for like extreme
pigmentation I'm going to take this
Sigma lo4 brush and take birthday girl
this sparkly color how can I not use
this I'm just going to focus on the
inner corner and just a little bit on
the brow bone to make it pop this is
really opens up the eyes and it can lift
the eyes to diffuse just a little bit on
the brow bone too much now I'm going to
add a little bit of winged liner
actually will fully dedicate a video to
how I do my winged liner if you guys
start out my little channel under my
videos but I'll be right back I'm going
to take em to tin brush and take Forever
Young and lit it on the lower lash line
and then I'm going to tap into the new
black P pink is the new black I'm
assuming the hot pink next have a cool
shake it up mascara from Rimmel you guys
seen this it's really heavy this to the
mascara and it has a shaker in it if
volumes and it's plum free and they
clump free with every use shake it to
refreshing it when need it prevents it
from drying out I'm just going to apply
to my lashes and we'll see what happens
here the brush is just like a big pretty
normal looking brush but I can go ahead
and tell you I'm going to despise this
mascara because you can see it's one of
those really watery can you see that
it's like barely putting anything on my
lashes super watery mascara look at it
it's just up just flings everywhere
hmmm it's not doing me any favors at all
so I feel like really wet and I feel
like if I blink or if it even slowing
off my last
like it would splatter everywhere cuz it
feels so watery I hate watering mascaras
I think I said that my favorites video
and they also don't listen my poor
little lashes at all the watering
mascara see they're still pointing
downward
I'm going to take Mika notes from Lily
lashes I'm going to have to go back to
my original dior mascara just to get
these bottom lashes coated have this
super hot pink color from the minis from
the birthday collection from Kylie this
color is called party girl let's see
what it looks like on my change it like
neon it gets too much with the eyes this
is her lip velvet not her lip matte I
like to lip velvet 20 times better
there's not as drawing
all right cool we got hot pink on I
guess we'll do hot pink I think it is a
lot with the eyes but we're going to
rock it so yeah this is our friend a
local and now I have the blur spray from
the link up this is their new setting
spray and shall I just shake it I think
what's the help blow you see what
happens
don't gotta get it going you know I'm
going to Pat it out with smelling
medicine that smell very mentally and
mediciney it's freaking me out a little
bit of that spray but we'll see what
happens
oh my god it's gonna happen to me oh
right this is the final look guys I like
all the products but sadly my mascara I
didn't like I kind of want it to love it
be one of the drugstore mascara check
out the L'Oreal paradise with a big shot
