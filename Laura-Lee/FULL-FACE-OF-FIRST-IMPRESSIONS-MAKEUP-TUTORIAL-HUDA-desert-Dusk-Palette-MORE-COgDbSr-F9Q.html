to be a first impressions makeup
tutorial we are very familiar with these
on my channel and lots of new stuff that
I haven't get I have not gotten a chance
to try it out so I figured I would do a
person pressures makeup tutorial and
test out things like the new hours
foundation from Beauty palette Uranus by
Geoffrey mani and some stuff I ate
cosmetics in Smashbox and all kinds of
new stuff that has come out we have
loved some new makeup and it's hard to
like individually try them all out on my
channel so I figure it will be great to
do a person brushes makeup tutorial and
plus I know a lot of you guys miss
tutorials so I figured this is a great
way to still test products out and still
get it tutorial on my channel hope you
guys enjoy that um any announcements oh
cool announcement okay so with my makeup
line a little update for you guys I'm
going to be releasing the first product
just releasing it it's not gonna be for
sale until October but I want to be
releasing the first product on the 12th
of September so hold on tight follow me
on instagram or you can follow my
brand's instagram at larlie los angeles
or my instagram at Laurel early to see
the reveal of the first product remember
September the 12th you will be able to
see what I've been working on for so so
so so so long and I am so excited for
you guys to see I could just pee my
pants I'm also nervous without further
ado let's sing a little jingle B and
we'll go ahead and jump right into this
video
getting started I have a new primer
which is the YSL oh I was primer this is
a a primer that has sunscreen in it and
it says to shake so what's shaking it up
really well the primer comes in the
sleek black packaging a turn lid and a
little o super watery it just like
squeegees out smells nice smells a
little weird but it smells nice let me
get my mirror ain't even got my mirror
set up y'all she ready she's ready for
this into the spoon it feels very
moisturizing to start off it does smell
I think that chemically smell that I was
smelling in the beginning is this
sunscreen in it I do like when a primer
has some sunscreen in it because it does
give your skin that extra layer of
protection from the Sun we pretty much
face the Sun every day more than we
realize especially walking to the car
and back into the mailbox and you know
trying to get y'all fast food in the
drive-thru the Sun is penetrating your
skin so it's nice to have this daily
protection I'm gonna make it white I
need it now my cat woke me up by jumping
on my head at 8 a.m. I know you guys
would like girl how our day is done at
a.m. but just know that my day ends at
like 2:00 in the morning normally
working on stuff so I like to wake up
late in work late that's just my
schedule that I get to make for myself
so YouTube light is definitely a
different life next we're going to go
ahead and try out this foundation I have
the shade be 45 and be it 40 because I
have a little bit of a tan right now I
think I'm gonna go for it be a 45 now
this is a 24 hour we're flawless matte
coverage in oil free foundation with
broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 20 it's
this also has sunscreen in it so let's
be a great mat full coverage foundation
real quick tip on this I kinda already
got to try it out so this is kind of a
person pressures on my channel but not
necessarily because I got to try this
out whenever I was in Marrakesh with
Whitesell they let us I wish I had the
tube here so I could show you but they
give us a little samples of it and let
us try it out and give us you know give
them our thoughts upon it while we were
there I'm gonna take a clean for once y
6 from morphe I'm going to dab it and oh
this shade is gonna be too light for me
and this
the darkest shade that I got so the
great news is I just found there was a
hair I just found a little sample ball
they sent me this is shade sixty so as
you can see you see how much darker that
is that's actually more my skin color I
don't know if you guys can tell so we're
actually gonna use amber today because
you definitely want to be able to wear
this all day and like have that moment
with this foundation same foundation
just in a different bottle shade amber
is the more rockin and rollin with what
is my wife's egg so if you can see that
was be forty five so now we're gonna
push amber into our skin I really liked
applying this with a Beauty Blender or a
brush it's really up to your preference
I thought I applied nicely with both so
you don't have to fret there oh good it
does apply a little bit dewy as you can
see but I found that it does get pretty
gosh-darn matte scoota and my camera a
little closer so you guys will be able
to see a little bit more next to try out
I didn't get to try this out yet so this
will be a first definitely first
impressions for me this is the all ours
concealer supposed to be a very at full
coverage long wearing concealer I have
the shade of four here yeah I think four
is gonna work well it's not too it's not
too too bright which I don't like my
highlight to contrast that hard so I'm
gonna ply it in those areas I'm going
out with the y6 as well just blend it
out incredibly well the concealer felt
pretty thin but yet had a good bit of
coverage so hey I'll take it why not
this is our skin it feels pretty damp on
the skin but in time this product does
dry down on the skin it you don't have
to worry about such a heavy wet filling
and it also does become quite matte so
next we have a new powder trail which
I'm really excited about we have this
really cool powder from it cosmetics is
bye-bye breakout for Olli or acne prone
skin I'm using the translucent one which
is a neutral shade I'm gonna take a
Beauty Blender and put some in the lid
and then I'm gonna press it come on
little mirror work with me here on the
under eye just to really set that really
interests
in how this powders gonna play me
tonight because I am gonna do a little
carpet tonight and there will be lots of
flash so it's a really great trying time
to try out any product right Laura watch
it sabotage me okay we are gonna let
that set for just a second I'll be right
back to wipe it off and continue this
video it came a TP I'm gonna take it
8:54 wipe the excess powder off and I
think my skin looks pretty gosh-darn
full coverage not too shabby
it's looking pretty good oh okay next
we're gonna try out a new bronzer this
is the Victoria Beckham X Estee Lauder
this bronzer are supposed to be at the
bomb diggity I've heard like so much
rave and hype about it so better be good
hmm I'm gonna come for ya just kidding
it is supposed to be really good it
comes in this heavy AF luxurious
packaging and I got to meet Victoria
Beckham they had like a little admit in
New York for Fashion Week and I got to
meet her I'm gonna take a m58 one brush
by the way this one is in Shea there's
different shades oh one is your ah my
son and let's see what happens
it's really pretty if you can see how
smooth it looks it's not getting patchy
whatsoever which is always a good sign I
really hate whenever bronzers don't
apply evenly and they have like that
grit or that patchiness to it and it's
like chunky on your cheek and I'm like
girl no get out of here this one is so
nice
Estee Lauder has nice bronzers the SA
edit had nice bronzers so I'm not I
always look forward to using the
bronzers because they rarely disappoint
I'm gonna take an mo brush and just try
to work out that nose by the way this
bronzer is super matte so it's great for
contouring or bronzing up the skin
whatever you prefer to use it as do you
think chicken wing
I don't person say I have a new blush on
deck so I'm gonna use sweet for my
sweets sweets for my sweet mmm
super MAC Cosmetics and I'm gonna put
this on the apples of my cheeks I'm
gonna take it e3 blush just tap tap tap
some on and there's hit the apples of
the cheeks this is like a very vibrant
blush but it shows up quite light on the
skin like it's not too crazy I like my
brush blushes I always call blushes
brushes
the word is so close and I'm also a
lunatic it's quite subtle but I always
like my blushes to be a little bit more
so because I don't like that pop of
color so much with Apple I need to be
way more so next we have a highlight
well it is Uranus by Jeff P star and
many this is their second collab and
this one is way more yellow at home or
golden the other one was more light more
pinky tone really excited to try this
out I'm gonna try out with one of my
favorite highlighter brush is the art 30
at 6 it's a nice little wispy brush but
yet picks up a lot of product so we're
just gonna twinkle it back and forth
this is stunning I just put on so much
highlighter and I'm not mad about it but
I just put I'm alive but anyways a
little bit goes a long way I am using a
wispy brush as well and it's still just
like a little goes a long way that's all
I got to say it's a very blinding so if
you like those heavy-duty blind against
highlights girl Uranus will be your
friend now what I like to do once I have
my face makeup on is by the way
everything that I've tried out so far
including that the setting powder is
okay it looks a little bit heavy but I'm
gonna hit it with some mac fix+ spray
because it's so powdery right now to
luminize everything just a little bit
now I like to take a sponge and just Pat
that moisture in this is why I don't
have my eyebrows on yet by the way
because I can just like beat the
eyebrows as well well I think my face
makeup looks pretty gosh darn good what
do you guys think sound off in the
comments section down below now we will
draw on I got mac fix+ all over my shirt
now it's soaking wet I do this every
time now I'm gonna go ahead and draw all
my eyebrows use my precisely my brow
pencil then I'm on the packaging of and
that me the fun begins we're gonna test
out the desert dusk palette from who'da
por ahora hora and it looks like this
Alachua I've heard lots of mixed reviews
on this I'm excited to try it I haven't
washed this haven't done anything with
it as you can tell so far I really
wanted to dig my finger in Cosmo but
what I'm understanding with this palette
a lot of the shades are glitter instead
of more of a pigment people thought they
were pigment and it's more glitter nice
with the glitter glue so I'm going to
first of course use some of the mattes
to blow it out and then add one of these
cool colors on my lid but just like
watching it oh that's so pretty
so I renegade is so pretty which is this
guy right here he's very duochrome if
you can see that it's really pretty um
but like Twilight let's see Oh Twilight
it's stunning I don't know this great
cosmos the one is like a glitter yeah I
just watch this like a glitter if you
can see it needs to be used with a
glitter glue and I'm okay with that like
if I spend money on a poly and you need
to put down some glitter
like I'm okay with that as long as the
glitter looks good so I'm excited to try
it out it is it has a lot of warm tones
kind of like our last palette in it but
it is a different palette and I see they
like the dust desert vibe she's given
off here so I like the color scheme it's
nice the first shade I'm gonna go in
with is desert sand which is a nice
cream shade which I always start my
makeup looks with to soften up the I
shoulda primer Oh a little bit of
Fallout no big deal I like a little bit
of Fallout actually this is an eight
twenty seven brush do you guys like a
little bit of fallout I personally do
I'd rather have like a little bit of
dust flying then none at all I like
whenever the brush picks up that shadow
really easy yeah a little kickback I'm
alright with that so if you're gonna see
I'm just like blowing this all over to
soften of that I should a primer base I
got down which is gonna make everything
easier to blend out in the long run if I
take the r39 which is one my favorite
blenders and I'm going to take the shade
eat-in which is a peachy color
Aidan whoa look at that pigment honey I
just dipped into it once girl girl that
pigmentation has got me shaking and
quaking next I'm gonna take Oh ditz oh
you do
odhh I think that's how you pronounce it
I'm sure the comment section will alert
me if I've done that wrong no one has
ever held back on telling me whenever I
say something wrong so I'm sure you guys
will let me know hey little sister now
so I'm just gonna pop this in the outer
corner this is a really beautiful
chocolatey brown color these colors so
far blending so nicely like that's
beautiful so having some good luck here
I'm still using that hour 39 same brush
happenin I think I'm gonna have to go in
with renegade I kind of died over that
color it's just so poppity pop and
beautiful and I'm actually gonna put a
glitter glue down with it to try it out
just so it performs really well this is
the glitter glue from Too Faced I just
feel like sometimes loose pigments you
can definitely just use a glitter glue
they're not just for glitter look at
that it came out like a little turd just
put down a little bit not too much
glitter glue we don't want it to get too
crazy
are you trying to get that crazy y'all
I'm gonna take renegade with my finger
he's so Queenie oh yeah oh yeah that's
pretty
I didn't wet this either I just put down
on glitter glue well that sure is B ei
eautiful so no I'm gonna put on some
wing liner which I will use at my NYC
liquid liner I tried to Trude taught you
tried-and-true the favorites liquid
liner you just can't go wrong with this
liner
you just can't it's like so affordable
to you guys like I said I put on a
little wing and then all of a sudden
here we're Catwoman whoa doggy
so Realty Smashbox is coming out with
these new metallic lippy liquid
lipsticks and they launched it in
January but I got my hands on super
early so I'm gonna wear one today to try
it out I'm kind of between the shade
vino you know new ah oh we everyone
tried bold thicker which is brown the
only reason I want to try bold digger's
cuz it really matches my desert eyeball
oh I got a do my under eye too so don't
let me forget that you know remind me
let's go ahead and put this on though so
I really love how pigmented this color
is despite it being so bold and dark it
is that I put a but I kinda sort of want
to add this color on it too should I
let's do it
I really like it so pretty now let's
finish off the look by finishing up our
under-eye I'm gonna grab this Kylie like
this little book brush here emma's hey I
take amber which is super warm brown
color I'm gonna buff it okay I'm gonna
take ODE and then I'm gonna take a
blender and just soften that up just to
blend it out I'm gonna take the Victoria
Beckham X Estee Lauder black liner and
hit that water line and I'm gonna take
the Victoria Beckham X Estee Lauder
mascara I like the fact they said that
that with this mascara that they made it
with the one pops out but isn't snatch
much mascara off of it but the only
problem is the one is so tiny I really I
just put on my upper lashes and I didn't
dye forward like the formula and the way
it worked okay I didn't also die for on
the lower lashes either so it's just not
my cup of tea but really as far as this
you know that it cosmetics trance isn't
powder I like it but I felt like it
wasn't good to set my under eye with I
think it would be better just to set the
whole face with so I didn't really like
I'm under iron I didn't really like the
mascara with the rest of stuff I really
liked so far I'll leave down the comment
section how the foundation wore but I
have worn it before and it did wear wear
really well on me but I will leave that
down there anyways for you guys for the
six of the video and because I will be
wearing it for a really long time today
