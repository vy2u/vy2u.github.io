take off the giveaway box hey guys
what's up welcome to my channel first
off let me just say this I'm sorry that
my reveal video of nudie patooty was
such a hot mess
it was Newton's law that day everything
that could go wrong did go wrong
that's his law right you sure I think
that's Newton's law her fees law gosh
there's someone in here that knows news
love is slowly trying to slap me through
the screen I know I want to apologize
and I was trying to refilm half of it
and edit half of it I was just gonna
refill the whole entire video and do a
much better job but I had a promise like
the whole my whole side of the internet
for 4 days straight that I was gonna
reveal everything that Thursday and I
didn't want to let you guys down because
I wouldn't have time to refilm it all
redo the makeup whole makeup part nah I
wanna let everyone down and make the
reveal late so I posted it and some
people were upset that the video wasn't
as professional as they would like it to
be so I want to say I'm sorry about that
I just happens in other news here's
sweet little kitty this will distract
you anyways today's video is going to be
doing a full face of makeup of my holy
grail makeup meaning this makeup is like
makeup you need in your life I think
it's absolutely amazing it's just not
new good makeup that I recommend but
this is makeup I've been using for such
a long time and that I really love and
then like if I travel it comes with me
like this is makeup that like I count on
day in and day out like if I'm getting
ready off camera these are the products
I grab for years like a lot of these
products have literally been using for
years why are we talking a lot about the
products I will also be using girl what
I've been using for months and months
and months and you guys just didn't know
about Plus you guys want to see more
looks with this is the perfect
opportunity that I know this intro is
approximately 10 years long
oh we're gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE song
I'm gonna insert one right now
you can go ahead and jump right into the
video starting out this is just a primer
that I grab all the time now this one is
their new packaging actually my old
crusty one which I feel like I should
have shown you by the way my nose is
burnt kinda from the Sun so this is
their new packaging and I figured I'd
show it to you in their new packaging so
you could see what it would actually
look like if you were to want it
yourself but this is the Smashbox
photo-finish smooth and blur this is one
of their best selling primers one that I
love the most and I feel like it just
really smooths and blurs the skin it
literally does what it says this one's
brand new but like I said I have the
original packaging which is like clear
that's like rusty that I use all the
time I'm gonna have to seriously be
looking at my mic the whole time because
like looking over because this thing
sabotage me and that's the reason why
half my video how'd it be refilm last
time because the freaking mic went out
for no reason like we don't know why it
went out I just know and then quit
working out was that I'm so like
terrified of that happening again I'm
like because on my monitor you can see
the little bars moving you can see that
it's working grab two three foundations
in here I normally travel with more than
one foundation for whatever reason an
hourglass vanish stick foundation in the
shade beige can do no wrong I also use
as a concealer as well the NARS one if I
want my skin to be more dewy less matte
that one's more matte I use the NARS one
and then for an affordable option that's
really beautiful I love this Wet n Wild
what it's like fuck I just had McDonald
it's like five bucks and it's a really
amazing foundation if you're on a low
budget or if you're just tired of
spending fifty dollars on foundation in
general try this out I think you'll
really like it it smells like paint
thinner which I don't love but you know
you get past it it doesn't smell like it
once you got it on your face when I use
this today I'm actually probably gonna
mix in a little bit of the NARS with it
I really love the spatula yeah I could
see the shades gonna be a little too
like she got some Sun I gotta go rebuy
my shade speaking of brushes somebody
use my y6 which a lot of you guys now
have because of the brush collection I'm
so excited about the brush collection
we'll be coming back
very soon so just hang tight look how
pretty this foundation is I know I'm
mixing them but still so pretty
I used the shade of bronze beige and
it's so that's because I got some Sun
yesterday but it's still too light come
on grey hair peeking through another
product I've been loving is this powder
from lemare it's really dirty but it
comes with like this rubber protector on
it because it's super bougie but I could
just sprinkle my brush in it and just
set my face with it so I'm just gonna
take it 8:54 brush and just like push
this into my skin like a very light
layer of it though I don't want to look
too powdery and I avoid the under-eye
because I still have to put my concealer
on a concealer I've been using for years
and years is the NARS creamy radiant I
can't get past it
it just doesn't crease on me and it
covers up these bags that ain't Chanel
real whale am i every single time I take
my m-53 is-6 brush we're just gonna dab
that out all my brushes are dirt ash she
needs a bath and I normally just pop it
on my eyelid and kind of use it as a
primer as well you actually set my under
eye I like the Laura Mercier translucent
loose powder I have a few powders I like
I would say the Laura Mercier is one
that I just grab every single time and
it never does mean dirty like the cover
FX perfecting one I like the Too Faced
Born This Way at theory old you have a
really dry skin you might not want to
put this much powder on stick it make
your skin feel really tight and dry I
like to dust away the excess and then
hit it with a setting spray to melt it
into my skin or eyebrows I actually have
two brow pencils that I love you guys
already know about the benefit precisely
my brow pencil and shade number four
you guys know about that lately I've
been using the honest scioscia brow
definer in medium brown this one I felt
like the word brown was wrong I feel
like I was would say brow they're medium
brown medium brown hmm I've been liking
this whenever I want to do a more quick
brow less precise I'll show you how I
use it whenever you get these things
going I hate the way the tip of them is
so I just rub it on both sides to get it
kind of pointy powder smells like
perfume it smells so good never smell a
setting powder that smells good it's
bizarre but it smells delicious
so I feel like this brow isn't quite as
precise a little more messy per se but I
still like the way it looks and well
know we have eyebrow so next we're gonna
move on to eyeshadow and I'm gonna show
you a look with nudie at patootie nudie
booty launches on 424 which is this
Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. PST I'm Marley Los
Angeles comm honey oh my good there she
is in all her stunning glory she's so
pretty this is a brand new palette I'm
going to show you I'm showing you right
now but I'm gonna use my used one for
this tutorial
she's so sleek and sexy she's a big girl
too first else happen to undress and
then I'll move on into streaking so
undressed really I feel like just sets
the primer it doesn't it does have color
for sure as you can see but color is
really mandatory and a palette as far as
I loosen up that primer because if you
don't your transition shade can stick
down really hard and then it gets chunky
or it's not a softly blend it you just
make your job harder that's why I like
to do this it just makes the job easier
and it does apply a little color so
you're already building up some color
next tapping into streaking just gonna
blend that back and forth and I'm using
the exact same brush and I like to use
streaking as a light transition shade
next up I'm going to tap in to reveal
with an r39 bright I really like to
place reveal right into the crease we're
just gonna build up a couple different
brown shades first a lot of you guys are
requesting a wedding look with this
palette because I had mentioned it's
such a beautiful look with a wedding if
you guys followed the larlie Los Angeles
Instagram account you'll see like tons
of freaking looks with it that I posted
it from the model that literally one on
one was wearing the one's a beautiful
look ever and it's such a wedding day
look just like a stunning wedding or
prom or special event looks just like
next up I'm gonna grab butt-naked and
then I'll tap into some strip I'm using
butt-naked on the same brush now this is
our little bit of a toasty or warmer
matte brown shade it's so pretty and
it's really great to deepen up the look
just a bit these brown sits so pretty on
top of one another as you can see we're
getting it really deep by just adding
brown on top of brown
have you guys ever blended until
literally your hand and wrist are just
sore I definitely have them I um I got
my arm is getting tired girl but you
just got to keep blending honey now I'm
gonna take strip twists our golden
yellowy color like golden mustard color
and I'm just gonna put it up top a
little bit higher I'm gonna grab a bit
of Nicki Nicki which is her deeper Brown
I'm just gonna start pushing this in all
around cuz we're gonna do a dark
chocolatey smoky so for those of you
asking the PAL will be it sold on
beautybay we are shaping beautybay their
units they don't have a specific launch
day although I know it'll be soon I just
have a date for you guys they're
international Anne don't want to spend a
fortune on shipping because guys
shipping for the United States is
expensive cuz this is where we
distribute out we just read out in
California we give it to beautybay they
distribute out of the UK so it's less
expensive on the ship page you guys want
to hang tight for the UK people and
international people for beauty pay to
get it they will have nudie patootie
I just don't know their exact date but
as soon as I know girl you know I'm
gonna let you know everything like we're
all dark and smoky and for the lid you
guys were requesting me do it look with
jaybird which is our fiery duo Kwame
foiled color so I'm gonna show you guys
how I apply this and again I apologize
in the other video me applying all
natural our gold shade those sickening
on me applying the gold shade it didn't
show up on camera so I apologize for
that and just talking eye shadow with
you guys like if you guys want your
shadow to last longer to have max
pigmentation and I showed a primer or a
concealer something tacky down your lid
really helps with that it also helps
with it not to crease as much so if you
invest in an eyeshadow primer or
something to put down on your lid that
will help so much
also with shimmers out of habit I like
to normally hit my shimmers with a
little mac fix+ or you can just wet them
in general I've always done that doing
my makeup and it just makes them stick
on you're able to pack on so much more
shimmer without fallout without a mess
I'm gonna go ahead and put on give a
booger put on my shoe a lip enhancer
this is my favorite product joues ever
made
I am gonna add a little glitter glue
I'll just use some of this two-faced
glitter glue and I'll just pop some on
the back of my hand and only use just a
teeny tiny amount because you don't need
much
it's the glitter glue is down I'll just
take j-bird on my finger and just start
pressing it in this way it's less messy
you have more control yeah I think it
looks so pretty I'm gonna add just a
little bit more of Nikki Nikki which is
our darkest brown shade that we used
last just poke it around this time I'm
gonna apply with a flat synthetic brush
so you guys can see I do have the
glitter glue down on my eyeball right
now so it helps this is the m41
brush I'm gonna take a large Los Angeles
eyeliner which launches in May I'm just
gonna line let me use for mascara one of
my Holy Grail mascaras this is the
volumous lash paradise by L'Oreal it's
so good and I'm just gonna go ahead coat
these lashes who can guess my favourite
lashes in the world how I put on lashes
I've like a super in-depth lashes do's
and don'ts video on my channel and if
you're trying to tap into false lashes I
recommend watching it it's very helpful
I'm gonna take streaking and strip blend
them across the lower lashline when I
say Budnick it which is our deeper
warmer Brown and I'm just gonna blend
that as well then lastly I'm gonna take
Nicky Nicky which is our deepest Brown
just blend that all the way from
Internet or corner I want the lower
lashline to be super smoky I have two
bronzers that I've been loving this one
is celebutante this one's from morphe
and it's 12 bucks
and I like to mix these two together
actually and using them and then I also
love this is the milk chocolate Soleil
bronzer from Too Faced it's really
pretty
I'm gonna use this one today because I
did get a tan and I don't feel like the
toothpaste one the milk chocolate one's
gonna turn out it's pretty on me tonight
a power 14 brush I'm just gonna pull in
this on in Peach Primrose by flower
Beauty has been my go-to blush I love a
peach blush I'm gonna take my e4 blush
and a brush brush I like all the flower
Beauty blushes like honestly you can't
go wrong so peaches in your color like
check these out at Walmart I love them I
think they're great and they're for a
good price pepper highlighter I've been
working on a highlighter formula for
quite a while now I'm just gonna let you
guys know that I don't know when or what
that's gonna look like launching as far
as like the date gonna go ahead and
apply one that I've been working on
because I want you guys to shoot make a
picker what I like the blinding this I
just hate whenever highlighters turn
like a gray color so you're just gonna
get very specific with your coloring I'm
gonna apply my own liquid lipstick
because I live it this is jaybird on my
lips also in the center that I'm gonna
apply this color pop it's called tip toe
such a pretty lipstick color but first I
need this to dry a little bit oh I
definitely recommend their lipsticks
color pop has really amazing lipsticks

my Holy Grail products that I think are
like above and beyond amazing that you
need in your life they have never led me
