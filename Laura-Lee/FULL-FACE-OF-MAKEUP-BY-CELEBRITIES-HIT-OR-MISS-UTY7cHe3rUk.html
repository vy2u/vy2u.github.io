no reason whatsoever it's just being
completely rude to me I'm gonna put on
my me I'll cap that is covered in cat
hair to hold my hair back shows I'm oh
I'm gonna try out the new Kylee
concealers in this video by the way so
the first product I'm going to test out
is the primer from Estee Lauder X
Victoria Beckham it looks like this the
packaging is font sigh this line was so
expensive and I think it's so expensive
because the daggum packaging is just too
nice geez Louise but Estee Lauder
honestly like the Estee Lauder brand is
super luxe makeup brand like their
prices are pretty expensive as it is but
Esther laughter's got some good ass
makeup and they've been around since the
dawn of the dinosaurs so good for doom
this feels like a moisturizer and I kind
of have a mustache today whoa she needs
to so this is by Rihanna her makeup line
is fin t it's at Sephora and on 50 comm
I'm gonna use shade 280 this foundation
does oxidize a little bit and there are
40 shades I believe which is amazing but
I haven't had a bit trouble finding my
exact shade I think to 80s it I've just
gone back and forth with a shape thing
like trying to figure it out if you go
to Sephora obviously you can get the
Sephora workers they'll help you like
really figure it out I recommend trying
to get in store and pick a shade cuz
there's so many cheese from rather than
just doing it online if you can this is
my wat6 brush from morphe and i use this
in every video because it is my favorite
foundation brush I love a good soft flat
kabuki brush to blend out foundation
this foundation though just do you see
like my hairline I feel like it's
turning a little bit this foundation
though it's really nice it's a good one
next we're gonna do we're gonna fix this
cap next up we're gonna do Kylie comb
see today
is lots of talk about these I've to
shade
pine nut and birch Kylie did not play
with the shade range which makes me so
excited look at the shade range if you
can see the two colors I took out on
that side over there and I'm really
excited about all her shades though that
was awesome of her can't wait to try out
the quality of the product if you guys
haven't seen my review of her brushes
check it out first I'm gonna try perch
I'm gonna try birch birches a little
pink baby not huh oh that's too dark I
don't know this is more like if you
don't want to brighten too much the
under eye this is if you do so I think
I'm gonna go with birch they feel super
creamy they don't feel thin and liquidy
like they're gonna like not cover much
like they feel thick if you guys can see
like it's kind of thick looking these
are I would say more of a heavy duty
consider consider she doesn't making out
words now I'm even trying to say words
right concealer I think that this is
actually oh like really creamy wine is
it look you remind me of tart shaped
tape oh it reminds me a tour shape
tape a little bit it's like really
adhering to my skin which is for me and
that's nice I like that I do I do I do
ooh huh nice I put on way too much cuz I
didn't know but it feels heavy duty and
thick I didn't need that much concealer
so just know if you get these a little
goes a long way full coverage mama
coming through okay that's a concealer
um so far I do like it I like full
coverage concealers I like my dark
circles to be covered I use way too much
I ain't known better I'm learning next
I'm gonna take this Victoria but back
home setting powder look at this
component it's like heavy enough to kill
a man which that's a terrible reference
but it is something serious I bet this
is so expense
this was sent to me using my little y11
brush to apply this to my under-eye
seems to be setting the makeup nicely by
the way that Victoria Beckham primer is
a really nice primer I am I like you
next up I'm gonna use none under than
than KK beauty in the shade medium her
contour kit I like to mix the two shades
this one's a little too cool this one's
almost a little too warm but I think
they're really buttery and worked nicely
together
we use our 14 brush so hungry for
highlighter I'm gonna take this manray
highlighter from NARS I'm using this one
because man ray is a famous awti and
Norris I think it is broken it's arrived
drop test approved NARS collabed with a
naughties to create a really beautiful
line so I'm going to use this famous
artist that is so I'm gonna use this
highlighter it's really pretty and I'm
gonna use it are at 30 it's six brush
with it and I just want to show you guys
it's just it just does me right so I
have to hi there pallets from famous
makeup artist I considered Pat McGraw
famous for sure in a celebrity she's
celebrity makeup artist but I do
considered her to definitely have Fame
behind her name she's iconic legend so
this is one of her palettes this is the
mothership
now these palettes cost your arm and leg
and soul so I'd I'm not encouraging you
know we're saying everybody should go
out and buy it
I just appreciate her line I appreciate
her art that she's done for years so I
want to use it and I did like the first
one that I used a second famous makeup
artist is Mario which is someone I look
up to you in the beauty world I think
he's amazing he collab with a BH and so
many
some transition shows out of this one
starting with Isabel so I have the Kylie
cosmetics concealer down oh my god this
color is pigmented AF down as my primer
and I'm using it in five seven three
brush why does that sound like a
spaceship name is I don't know I did not
know this color was this deep and
pigmented until I dipped into it and now
I'm like oh okay we're going with a warm
rusty look not really we're not I wanted
to do something different so we'll see
what happens I'm just gonna blend this
out and still use it kind of like a
transition I never plan out my makeup
looks before a YouTube channel like it's
normally like just me having a good old
time filming with you guys and then I
kind of go with the flow with the makeup
look so maybe in the future all I rarely
do I mean I have to definitely plan them
out before but if I do know tutorial I
normally have an idea but most of these
videos I just kind of rock and roll with
it
something in my soul is screaming for me
to use this blue shade I'm going to use
a m41 brush oh holy pigments not playing
it's not playing I've actually had two I
think two opportunities meet Pat McGrath
and I wasn't able to make either of them
and I just think that that is just
absolutely horrible and if I ever get a
third opportunity I'm gonna take it
honey I'm gonna take our 39 brush and if
you can see the edges are a little bit
harsh from the blue shadow so I'm gonna
tap into Isabel again and just really
soften that up but with a light hand so
we're not dispersing too much blue color
because we don't want a massacre on our
eyes
I tapped into it just a touch of the
black shade from the Pat McGrath palette
to blend out this outer corner just a
touch because a little goes a long long
way honey I'm gonna take some of this
light shade on an m5 one five and just
pop that in the inner corner and while
we're in fancy I'm just gonna hit that
brow bone with it as well because why
not
any Lizzie McGuire fans in the house I
know I was oh my good I'm gonna take the
Gigi Hadid X Maybelline mascara this is
the lash sensational which is one of my
favorite drugstore mascaras I am going
to apply this to my lashes darling
you're like no where else would you
apply it you know what I should have
done before I did this and I'm just now
thinking about it because I'm an idiot
I should have added a little bit of like
I showed it to the lash line there
because now you're gonna be able to see
my lunch ban is just gonna ruin it don't
do this with mascara on guys don't do
this with mascara on I repeat just all
around bad decision I mean you can't do
it mascara and I just it just makes it
harder I'm sorry but this mascara does
my lashes so good like it's good to me
okay
and we all know I don't wear blue often
but honey I'm just these are my favorite
lashes these are Miami from Lily lashes
Lilly ghalichi
is a famous model and she also was on a
reality TV show and she came out there
on lash line and me Lily text sometimes
and she's one of the sweetest people on
earth like she is such a nice nice nice
lady
I respect her so much in the industry so
grandma use her lashes okay they're my
favorite before I knew her personally
and it just made them so much better
knowing that the founder is just a doll
okay I went ahead and put the color
Isabel how'd it look I forgot the name
of it
on my lower lashline and now I'm going
to take the blue shade out of the Patty
McGraw V palette just smoke that right
on top I'm gonna K collabed with
jean-michel who is a artist as well
famous artist and I'm gonna use this
eyeliner it's called vivid I'm gonna put
it in the waterline and then I'm just
gonna throw some mascara on these bottom
lashes babydoll
it's drew on my eyeball Urban Decay's
eyeliners are just right and there's
nothing wrong about them like they're
just good liners okay so something I did
not think through is using this fin t
red lippy with bright blue eyes that
does not match and I'm gonna use it
anyways cuz I promise you guys I would
test it out I might change my lip color
for the ultimate look but I'm gonna I'm
gonna test it out it's like a super
liquidy lipstick but it's very even in
color so far
okay over drew my lips by accident
because the doe foot applicator is a
little strange so I'm not used to it but
it worked nicely I just over drew my
lips too much because it was my first
impressions and I didn't know the
pigment the amount of pigment in this
thing is absolutely unreal like I've
never used something with that much
pigment and I don't think the only thing
I will say is I have a million red lippy
so I'll be looking forward to new colors
and this but it just feels like nothing
on your lips okay these are so overdrawn
like I messed up but I do love the
quality and not let me like that's so
pretty I'm gonna use it naked by none
other miss Kylie she's so famous from
other lippies and her velvet lippies
which this is one of them are the best
as far as the concealer it reminds me so
much of tart shaped tape I'm not even
kidding like the coverage it looks so
pretty on so I'm here for the concealer
let's I hope to see like how it wears
but like as far as the applying creasing
it looks so good alright guys that is it
for this look celebrities make ups good
man to make it's good oh my god I forgot
my Selena blush girl wake up such a
famous collection from Mac um this is a
blush and bronzer I'm gonna tap into the
blush side girl
I'm embarrassed your friend Laura needs
to get it together I really love this
Mavi colored pink blush shoot that
foundation was way too dark for me by
the way just so you guys know it
oxidized and my face is way darker than
my neck and the foundation was too dark
so guys 280 is not my color I need to go
up a shade and try again I just have
trouble with the 50 foundation color of
the foundation but not like I adore it I
think it's great that's how they
consider killer killer Holly concealers
working out great
this stuff is really nice I need to get
used to that doe foot applicator the
setting powder from the Victoria Beckham
was really nice it worked out very very
well thank you guys so much for being
here watching I love you guys too Deb
