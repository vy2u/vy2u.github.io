we'll jump right into the video be sure
to subscribe to my channel before you

I love you Laura now let's jump right
into this video all right so to film
this video I'm gonna turn the hat around
backward you noticed I have gone a
little bit of a tan on my face that's
what is this weekend I went to
stagecoach for the first time ever and
I'd heard a stagecoach before but I'd
never been and I got invited to go with
Estee so I went and I had a lot of fun
but I was like okay I know stagecoach is
like a Country Music Festival and let me
tell you I've been to those four and
hello from Alabama I was like what is
this about to be about like what is this
gonna be like in California and it's
literally if Alabama had a Coachella
that's what stagecoach is I loved it I
saw Florida Georgia line they're one of
my favorite groups ever and I don't even
listen to that much country music but
Florida Georgia line are my people so we
can get them on my channel that's never
gonna happen okay all right the first
product I set right here and rolled up
while I was talking to you guys a lot
pay attention to the fact that I'm
rolling it up way too much this is the
professional license to block this is a
little facial primer and I definitely
don't hate this facial primer I'm not
like I just can't stand using it it does
definitely blot and mattify but I feel
like it's a little thick on the skin and
like creates a barrier between your skin
and your foundation so your foundation
is just setting on top of it I also
prefer a cream primer that can blend
into my skin versus a stick primer like
this so that's the reason I'm getting it
rid of it I don't really use it it's not
a horrible primer I just I'm not really
using it so let's pass it along to
someone who we oh I thought that was
gonna click foundation I'm getting rid
of today is by the body shop this is the
matte clarifying foundation and this is
not full coverage it says it's matte and
full cup high coverage 24 hour long wear
shine control I didn't like it actually
this is this is one product like I just
wasn't here for also the shade is about
18 shades to light so I'm gonna do a
light layer of on my skin but I feel
like it just clung to dry patches had no
coverage I'd also have two tubes of this
and none of them are my shade so it's
time to pass along to maybe someone else
who will enjoy it I'm just blending this
wrong shade out there
my face but that's okay this is the
theme of the video and that's why I'm
showing you okay we're gonna get rid of
her and then for concealer I'm going to
get rid of this I think this one is
newer from Mac if it's not new I just
recently got an MPR this is the Mac
Studio water way concealer I think this
is a gimmick that's right I said it I
said my keyword there you like shake it
up and it's like well water droplet but
it's a concealer and honestly it's very
drying on my eyes but yet feels kind of
greasy once it's like in place I'm not
here for this is so gimmicky it
definitely brightens the area and adds a
lot of pigment but I don't find that it
actually covers the area very well and
it feels so greasy no mom I know I
should a little bit goes a long way this
is just a hard note for me
I feel bad who I give this to I don't
really like it plus the Mac Pro Longwear
the original concealer is like amazing
like one of my tried-and-true so it's
like why would I even go there the
palette ah I'm gonna be getting rid of
today is by Tarte this is their
Amazonian clay finishing powder it has
the worst flash back on this size
Mississippi River I'm just not here for
it tarte has a better one that they made
it's the rainforest by the sea powder
and it's a lot better than this one so
out of the two I definitely recommend
the other wood it's almost like it's too
mattifying like I feel like my under
eyes were super dry and Creasy feeling
they just don't look like skin it's got
to go honey
just somebody else that ain't me that's
all I know the sheen is staying in this
house like a bronzer so pretty by the
way I'm Hello packaging and product
really pretty but it's kind of gimmicky
like all these colors mixed in do not
provide me with a very pretty color it's
also a very intense color I'm never
gonna use it I could keep as a
collector's item but call you try and do
all that she's got enough bronzers that
she loves yes I just scratched myself in
the face another bronzer the cocoa
contour I love this product for a really
long time and actually there's nothing
wrong with
product I'm not gonna not recommend it
to you guys it's a pretty bronzer
palette but to face just came out with
their natural collection and they had
like a bronzer blush highlight palette
in it and it's so pretty and it works so
well and I also love the individual sole
a chocolate bronzers where they change
the packaging I adore those so I'm just
never gonna reach for this again
especially because I have those and I
think those are better than this
I don't know if they're gonna
discontinued this or not but I'm never
gonna use it again so I'm gonna pay for
it and you know send it to someone who
needs a good contour kit I'm just gonna
mix together medium cocoa and dark cocoa
so just swirling the brush around in
this you get like pink and bronze and
all kinds of colors mixed in and I just
go I don't understand that I'm using
this blush but it's just like I said
it's kind of gimmicky okay for
highlighters I just had a bunch I want
to get rid of but we'll hang tight for
that and I just picked one I feel a hair
honey I picked one that I know I'm not
gonna use and it is this Urban Decay
disco stick it's like a holographic
stick like chunks of glitter which for
me I don't really like a glittery
highlighter I'm more so like a creamy
one that just kind of melts into your
skin and you just look like you're
glowing from within not like you
intentionally put glitter on your face
if you like a glitter highlighter don't
take any offense and go I'll keep doing
you but as far as me girl I just named
for me and also stick highlighters
sometimes they pull the makeup and they
shift your makeup around that you work
so hard on to get flawless so it's
enough I'll show you just like god I
cannot you see the chunks then you try
to move it around this is one of the
products that just doesn't work for me
and I love open to K you guys know that
they have so much good stuff their
vacation collection just dropped and
it's amazing we'll talk more about that
in another video but girl not the
glitter stick and also you can see the
patchiness where it's pulling my makeup
I feel silly I feel silly using this
somehow I ended up with this brow pencil
from ABH it's just too dark for me so
I'm gonna
this along as well this is a granite I
typically use a medium brown shade but
this one they're brown fences are nice
actually prefer their brow wiz or brow
the finer before their brow pencils I
really wouldn't use the brow pencil as
much anyways but also the color on this
one just have to let it go feel like
it's nice to like do a tutorial with the
products that I'm getting rid of instead
of just telling you guys what I'm
getting rid of because you get a visual
as to why it didn't work for me and
maybe you can see like oh that would
work for me or you could see like oh
hell no that definitely won't work for
me either you know so you guys can
really get some like it's more
educational still and you can learn
about the products that is a dark
eyebrow honey I have a couple I showed
of Palestine be getting rid of and I'm
going to show you all I probably won't
use all of them but I'm gonna go ahead
and show to you the first one is meet
Matt I do like the quality of the bomb's
eyeshadow palettes with these I'm I
don't know why I just don't use them the
meet Matt typically I rarely do an all
matte eyeshadow look I do like it when I
do do one but I don't do one very often
at all so I don't need this palette
around another one is the new Jeremy
Scott palette from Mac one of the
coolest packaging ever I think it's so
original and sickening but I am never
using this like know like I don't need
this many Purple's or this many blues
and if you can see like the packaging is
so big and a lot of space isn't utilized
because it's supposed to look like the
sound bites bumping up and down which is
cool but I can never travel with it it's
so big and bulky it just never ever ever
found myself pulling it out so I'm gonna
give it to someone who would enjoy
that's the H palette it's 28 color I
should have palette I have a lot of
palettes from BH that I live for and
they're super affordable so just know
that if you're looking for a super
affordable palette you can check out
their website but this one is an all
shimmer palette and I literally feel
like these colors are all like the same
color like these all look the same and
then like all these blues and grays look
the same so I'm like or have you in
touch this and I probably will never you
this so and then lastly this little
palette from Mac this one's called queen
supreme I've never used it and I'm never
going to because again the palette just
doesn't scream to me these colors are
all so wildly similar in the whole
entire palette is shimmer so even
wouldn't I like the size of it I feel
like I could travel with it for sure but
I feel like I couldn't get a complete
look out of it because they're all
shimmers and I don't have any
transitions or anything like that so the
palette it's just not for me personally
and how I use makeup where I do my eye
makeup I'm going to show you this mister
spray that I'm gonna get rid of it is
the festival refresh from Too Faced
typically with a setting spray I don't
just like a refresh spray I like I don't
feel like this one sets my makeup enough
like the urban decay one and then I use
like the tatcha one or this one or
Beauty glow one too if I'm more so
looking to enhance the glow but I don't
feel like this does either for me it's
just more of a refreshed sure night they
don't really need that so I need to be
locked in and load it not just refreshed
but it also smells like cotton candy and
I give it to them I do love that we're
gonna bump into this Jeremy Scott
palette I'm gonna tap into the
transition shade right here also the
mirror in here is super nice I give them
that but I don't know this is not a very
practical palette for my life been
trying so hard to eat healthier in
whenever new deepa tuning launched I'll
say okay now the new diva - do you want
your life is gonna be a little less
crazy you can start eating good again
and I just have not done that so I
actually need more of a brown shade so
I'm gonna tap into this shade from this
meat map palette I can't get over my
black eyebrows right now like it's hard
to make anything I'm trying to blend so
I shadow and make it look good but it's
kind of hard to make anything look good
at this point with my eyebrows are so
dark I take this orange shade on in our
39 brush and I'm going this kind of
upward in the crease area as well
now these shadows do have a lot of
pigment in them which is so nice I'm
gonna grab some of the hot pink and
we're just gonna pop it on the our 39 at
brush as well and I'm just gonna blend
that in but I'll keep it just a bit
lower
I'm gonna put a little bit of concealer
on the lid that way we'll put another
color down and it will really show up
and love doing this it also put glitter
glue down but I like putting down a
concealer to carve out the lid sometimes
they get serious whenever I am
explaining makeup steps and I can't hold
that I'm sorry I just get like really
into it I'm like okay next we're gonna
be putting this on the lid and people
think like something is emotionally
wrong in my life because I'm being
serious and that part of the video and
they think I'm really down and depressed
just know I'm okay that I'm just trying
to be serious and hopefully educate some
of you guys and maybe I'm not goofy the
whole way through the video but just
know I'm good your girl's good and I
appreciate the concern but you know
there are times we're like you're not
yourself and I'm like no I'm just being
serious go I'm just trying to help you
out no I really explain why I do steps
and maybe I don't come across as silly
in those parts of the videos but I just
want to explain that go I'm good I'm
good she's all good over here by the way
this I will say this is like a long calm
nude eye base it's so nice and I don't
want to get rid of it just to clarify in
the video I'm like I'm gonna take this
aqua green color and then I'm gonna take
the even lighter version of it on the
lid so we're gonna have an all matte
look today what do you guys think about
that actually I might put some purple in
the outer corner as well as well I'm
gonna take this purple shade and
honestly that mint shade was patchy AF
and did not show well which was super
depressing and put it on the outer
corner right there okay that shows it
way better I think
I'm gonna get rid of this curb liner
from Maybelline and dry his way too
shiny for me and I have a quite a few
that I've been loving but this one just
because she just ain't for me
not enough ink comes out this liner as
well like I have a lot of felt-tip
liners a lot dry shiny and there are
things that I love and don't love about
them but this one is just one kind of I
don't hate it but I just don't use it
cuz it's like kind of hard to fiddle
with and use I was like this random ball
in the middle of the brush and it also
just doesn't produce enough eyeliner out
of the actual thing the more I got used
to it the less I loved it so I always
had to bend it down on my table and get
some ink to pour out of it and then I
can use it this is annoying me so bad
trying to get like I've bent the brush
pouring out product you know and this
one has been used like two or three
times I'm getting frustrated okay
alright so we're mascara I'm gonna be
using the Kevin up on the essentials
mascara this mascara really didn't do
much for my lashes as far as lifting
them so I never grabbed for it a couple
that I do love I love the L'Oreal ah
with someone called in the pink tube you
guys know tell me down below I'm gonna
take the purple shade and buff it from
up from lower on my lower lash line from
inner to outer corner I might take some
of the orange shade and get crazy with
it honestly I feel like my under-eye is
so dry bust open from that powder on it
and I feel like it's not allowing me to
do a very good job on blending out a
creamy eyeshadow or an eyeshadow on the
lower lash line because there's just
snatching up the pigment and not
allowing me to blink this is so driest
like honestly doing my makeup with all
this makeup I'm trying to get rid of is
slightly frustrating because products
just aren't performing high one.they
them too and like they do you see the
shine it almost is so shiny almost looks
like a chunks of white on my liner but I
don't for lips I don't use
lips don't use them and and I don't want
to discourage you guys out of creativity
if you love using a colorful up lip by
all means I love a dark lip maybe but
just these neon II color lips like when
do you see me well I don't and I'd
rather just get rid of them
yeah at the festivals they do look cool
people but Groff like a clown so I'm
gonna let her go
yeah I feel like the eyeshadow on top is
actually really pretty I feel like my
lot eyelash just like trash can as well
as the liner in loose I have chunks of
lash glue or white on my eyes but I
don't that's how shiny the eyeliner was
it was a pain to work with my under eyes
are uncomfortable they're so dry I have
chunks of glitter on my face girl the
lips are patchy on top of them being
blue it's a different girl the lips are
mess these are products that if you can
see what I'm getting rid of them now
they may work for some of you but
obviously they just aren't made for me
and I don't need them my collection and
I want to pass them forward someone who
might enjoy them so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and enjoyed my
frustration of getting rid of products
that I don't use anymore I love you guys
thank you so much for being here don't
forget to enter the giveaway and I will
see you all in my next video oh she look
crazy so I'm gonna go wash my face hey
