your real nice hey guys what's up
welcome to my channel yeah today's video
is going to be me showing you guys a
makeup tutorial what products I don't
use anymore but let me like specify what
this means because this isn't
necessarily products that I hate just so
we're all clear on that
I recently um did my video on just
products didn't work out for me 40 I got
way too much indigestion today I
recently just posted a video on parts of
the didn't work out for me in 2017 so
that video will be you know somewhere on
my channel and check it out if you
haven't already so this video is more
about makeup that I am tossing and
getting rid of because I'm just not
using it right now for one reason or
another it doesn't mean I don't like the
product I'll just explain product by
product why I'm getting rid of it I do
when I throw it out I throw it out of my
Beauty room into someone else's hand to
try it out because they may you know
start loving it I don't just throw the
makeup in the trash just long enough
basically this is just stuff sitting my
makeup drawers ain't using and it's time
to let it go I kind of sort of wanted to
do like film me going through every
single makeup drawer and like pulling
out things I'm gonna get rid of like a
makeup clean out but I don't know
comment down below if you guys want to
see that that maybe let me take like way
too long maybe anywho I'm going to go
ahead and pop in because you guys know
we are doing giveaways in the month of

them and now we can skip on over and
sing the SUBSCRIBE song right about now
subscribe to my channel
and now we can jump right into the video
now you can see everything including the
lash glue left in my eye from last night
I just pulled out two lashes trying to
take out my lash glue all right starting
out I'm gonna be getting rid of it this
is me oh by the way let me go back
because I didn't give a shout out let me
give a shout out to Michael Finch makeup
and Shani Griffin because they both
inspire me to this video because they
both did this video so check out their
video on their Channel and that is where
the idea came from because I think their
channels are first I want to be getting
rid of this step one skin equalizer
primer this one's supposed to make your
skin radiant from makeup forever and I
really like all these primers that they
came out with a while back but I just
don't think it really makes my skin that
radiant and I don't know I don't hate
this primer I just I never go for it and
use it I think like in my being I just
think it's somewhat of a gimmick so I'm
just like avoiding it at all cost so I
think it's time to let her go I mean it
doesn't really do anything wrong to my
skin it just no just don't like it you
know like their other ones I think are
better and a little more pore minimizing
poor foundation you guys might punch me
in the head but that's okay I'm gonna be
getting rid of the Marc Jacobs
foundation I've held on for this one for
so long I did buy this product myself
and I'd go back to it all the time and
use it because it has such nice coverage
to it and the color of it is great but
it just gets in the small minds and it
has no mercy I swear this foundation is
like deadly if you got you know major
small lines like me it's just part of
how my face is shaped and I don't mind
them you know but they're there so I
don't know anyways this foundation and
just smile lines in it do not get along
they be fighting all the time I take my
y6 brush from MOFA which I will not be
throwing out oh my god Foundation just
flung all over Mike
I hate when that happens Foundation
stains so bad okay so I'm just gonna
buff this out it's so pretty on the skin
that's why I hate to get rid of it and
that's why I like keep going back to
using it but there's so many good
foundations that I'm loving right now
I'm like I don't need you in my life no
mo go ahead and get it all in the hair I
got some major dryness over here and
it's kind of clinging to that which a
lot of like drier foundations tend to do
anyways I am going to be letting go of
the rainforest of the sea
look at that foundation in my thumb
video this concealer I never reached for
after Tarte came out with Tarte shape
like there was no going back to any
Tarte
concealer that ever existed and this one
wasn't a terrible concealer by any means
I didn't mind it like Tarte just makes
good concealer so you might be saying
why are you getting rid of it well one I
just never use it because it's
heart-shaped tape and two it burns a
little bit my under-eye I don't know if
anyone else experienced this but it
smells like paint thinner and it trying
to conceal my bags so I'm gonna let it
go I mean you'll see it's like it's nice
you know it's not a bad concealer
there's just girl I never gonna reach
for this again I'm just gonna reach for
the shape tape if it's a tart concealer
and that's just what it is see it's like
tingling my under eye right now just
interesting I mean I never get a rash or
any bad side effect from the burning
maybe it's just me I don't know poor
setting powder I'm gonna be getting rid
of this amazing cosmetics powder because
it's a flashy baggy I enjoy step trying
out new setting powders and this one
does a really good job of like actually
setting the makeup like it's a nice
powder I don't know if it's like just me
but I have issues with things watching
back sometimes so I'm just I gotta let
them go
so I'm gonna go ahead and set the makeup
though you know really like this powder
like it does such a good job setting the
makeup so I hate to let it go I just
take pictures with the flash all the
time so I just have too many already
that did a good job with setting makeup
then don't do that some bronzer I'm
gonna let go of my ones the bronze from
siping alright and the reason I'm
letting go is actually really beautiful
I just don't use stuff like this that
are all mixed up together because I
don't like the way it looks on my face
doesn't my makeup Joe and I'm like you
know it's time to pass this to someone
else that might enjoy it
I'm gonna use my r14 bronzer brush and
I'll just swivel around see you get the
color it does not fall sembei darling
I'm gonna let go of this pretty vulgar
highlighter because the shade is just
not right for me it's really nice
quality very blinding I would say you
see how pretty that is it's just one of
those highlighters wherever you look at
me straight on it's just too gray
looking you can see that fog right there
it just doesn't look good unless I'm
turned sideways so I really don't like
that and have to be careful with
highlighters whenever it comes to that
kind of stuff cuz go I don't like that
weird residue I mean it's pretty on the
nose because that's not that's like
straight on but you know I don't know it
looks a little chalky from the side so
this is like a nice highlighter if you
had a lighter skin tone and these cool
toned highlighters look good on you but
girl just don't look good I'm gonna let
go of this brow pencil from an associate
Beverly Hills in medium brown really
great formula here it's a good eye red
pencil I know you guys something I
bumped my head but it is great it's just
that the pencil I don't really go for
pencils anymore with the sharpening and
all I
so much better the retractable whether
it be the brow is or the brow definer or
even the these are just more work or the
benefit they're precisely my brow pencil
like all those are what I go for every
single day like I never reach for this
one this one's brand new was sent to me
and PR and I kept it because like I like
her brow products but I'm not using it
ever so I'm just gonna get rid of the
pencils they're still nice though so
just me or is this pencil a little bit
more waxy than the original product what
do you guys think know for eyeshadow I'm
gonna be getting rid of this Kylie
Jenner the pressed powder or while I
reading that this is our purple palette
now I don't know if you guys remember my
review of this it is a pretty palette
but like I send the review I really use
these color ever and so I kept it
because I was like girl you might use it
you know you don't want to be getting
rid of it that quick you know you might
use it well guess what we are here
months later and I never use this
palette so I think it's time to pass it
along I mean it's just not for me these
colors I don't know I like this color
I don't I just I wouldn't necessarily
use them together and that's a personal
opinion remember like you may love these
colors and I'm not trying to be like I
get you to hate your purple palette it
ain't like that I'm just trying to tell
you much okay so I'm gonna take the
Amalfi this is the in about three brush
I'm gonna go ahead and get into this
lilac shade right here I just honestly
need a transition shade and that
transition shade if I'm not mistaken my
video it turned a little bit gray on me
so I don't really trust it can't be
trusted if you guys didn't know I've
been doing music leads like in my spare
time she can
people trying lying
I think they're really fun you guys know
I love to sing even though I can't sing
so music plays like that perfect like
I'm lip singing but I ain't really
singing so you don't hear my voice and
I'm in having way too much fun so if you
guys want to follow me on musically I am
Laura okay I'm gonna go in with this
purple shade next my nail color can I
just say that I same brush by the way I
hate it with everything in my being
because I went to the nail salon it
looks so much different on the little
gel now like little finger that you like
pick your color from it looks so pretty
and red and sparkly for the holidays and
then she put it on my nails girl it was
a mess so I I quickly realized and
regretted my decision and now I've been
stuck with these nails for almost a week
so we gotta get the nail color change I
mean it's not a terrible color it's just
not what I was going that's something
else we're gonna be tossing out
I'm gonna use in our 39 which is one of
my favorite eyeshadow brushes I don't
even know where I'm going with this look
whoops
but I'm gonna do it purple because it is
a purple palette after all oh my god
this color is so pigmented see like the
quality these eyeshadows aren't bad it's
just I don't die for the colors now I'm
gonna talk about a liner I have had this
liner for a long time so probably thrown
in the trash but it's called garnett ink
and it's one of those cushion liners and
I find that these are super cool liners
and I like them they're just a little
bit difficult to work with so I never
use them
this is only ullam I just prefer like a
regular liner just just what I use oh my
god
it is 100% dried out look at this mm-hmm
well that's why I'm getting rid of it
cuz it ain't good no more I told you I
don't use it now you believe me it just
cool well that was my liner so now I'm
like so I'm not gonna do a wing with
this look I would totally what's going
to that liner but I'm just gonna put a
little bit of black on and then we'll
add on some lashes I do like this liner
our liner was a plop they just dry down
on us I've had it for a while though
okay poor mascara I'm gonna go ahead and
get rid of the troublemaker mascara from
Urban Decay this spikey brush on here
the formula isn't that bad I don't think
it's that long long-lasting but the
spikey brush on here it hurts my I like
it stabs me a little bit and it really
doesn't do too much for my lashes I mean
I just don't love this mascara so I
never used this like ever for lashes
I've been sleeping on these lashes
forever because I always swear I'm gonna
do like a really cool look and then they
do it these are like half sea lashes
where they like go like halfway like
flutter out they're not like a whole
bitch I'm trying to like explain to you
guys and really sad manner but I guess
if I use them today then that'll be that
Oh what just won't throw I guess will
throw it out after I put on my eye
see what I mean they're like half of
your eye and I'm just
they don't look like terrible besides
the fact that my real lashes are being
crappy but when I go in with the two
shades that we used and buff it on the
lower lash line I'm going to add just a
little bit of the troublemaker mascara
change my face I'm actually gonna take
some of this pink shade and put it in my
inner corner because it needs like a
little pop and lastly for my lips girl I
bought this and I was always saya if you
saw my authentic beauty if you saw my
Sephora haul you saw this I was like so
calm just try it out
I tried it out and I kind of hated it on
my lips I look kinda like a dead person
but I like these vintage beauty glosses
and I think they're really cool galaxy
glosses if you're going for that look
but I just you know I try to out I
didn't love it so I never use it so it's
going bye-bye but here it is that's what
it looks like I also have another one I
like a little bit better the more purple
one but this was just like a weird
glitter I don't use it so you can see
it's like really cool and just ain't my
vibe
okay my darlings
that is it for this video I mean like I
said the makeup is it bad it's just I
have my reasons for what I don't like
things and I hope that you know you guys
kind of get what I'm going with
I love you guys thank you so much for
watching so yeah I'm gonna pass these
products along someone that will
appreciate them better than me and I
hope you guys have an awesome day and be
