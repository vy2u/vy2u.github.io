nervous with this challenge I have a
dinner to go to a 7 o'clock I'm gonna
look like a hot freaking mess
and uh well what else is new so it was 7
why is it 6:30 now I feel like I'm being
playing yeah I'm gonna go ahead and put
my hand a ponytail because girl we know
she's about to get messy would you guys
do this glass was full with mac fix+
PD on the inside just kidding it is
water it is tap water it should be
Dasani but it's not we're at least a
Fiji for God's sakes this is going a lot
I'm here to entertain you and I hope you
enjoy it and I tag you if you're a born
now homey you want to try found your
board at home and you want to try it fun
makeup challenge go get you a cup of
water and just have fun this will make
us 4 actually I'm gonna recommend this
to you because a lot of powder products
I'm gonna be using today and what is it
like destroys my powder products and I'm
just like oh let's see what happens to
me and then I'll decide if you guys
should do it at home without further ado
I'm gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE song and
then we're gonna jump right into this
video a little crazy
make sure it subscribe to a channel
unique
so we're gonna skip primer today exciton
really know how to add primer with a wet
brush oh my gosh
so with foundation today I'm gonna be
using the milk makeup golden sand matte
foundation I don't think it's gonna be
very mad after I wet it I was gonna use
a dewy foundation but then I was like I
really thought a dewy foundation would
end up looking the same I was wondering
if the water would skew a matte
foundation so I picked a matte one baby
I'm gonna use this little krill a beauty
like thing to like pour the foundation
out on so I can dip my wet brush in it
alright we have my y6 Rushmore PDUs coat
lauralee for a discount of 10% off look
at that look at you we're gonna give her
a good douse dripping so I feel like I
should give it a little tap or Izzy oh
girl it's like really wet I squeezed
you'd a little bit because that's just
gonna be nasty alright I have my little
thing here I'm just gonna switch over
look it's like suctioning to it because
the brush is so wet Wow look at that oh
man I feel like some weirdness going on
you can feel the texture like you see
how it's just to moisturize and it's
like it's weird it's like it's sticking
to my face but it's like it doesn't want
to
I'm getting really descriptive uh it
looks so nasty okay like honestly my
foundation feels about a million times
heavier than this foundation normally
feels I don't think it's messing up the
coverage but it's making me really
difficult to blend out also this is like
dripping water all over me I don't know
how supposed to get the brush this wet
but I took the challenge pretty serious
so it feels really gross on my skin
also for those of you who don't know I
just had a ruler creation to some makeup
so if you're seeing some like texture
right there this has gone better but you
can still see a little bit it is
residual from my catastrophe next up I
have the NARS concealer in custard and
I'm gonna dip a little concealer brush
in here oh yeah
it little squeegee off you know there's
like water down in here now okay here I
go
actually this is not looking I have a
feeling it's gonna crease like I can
just tell but I got that song in my head
for like the past six years and I just I
can't get the song out of my head what
is your favorite song right now I need
new music you guys have no idea like how
about I need new music I'm gonna throw
my phone out the window if I hear the
same song sits on my playlist again like
I'm going to lose it all sanity so
please comment down below let me know
some songs that you're loving right now
I would really appreciate it and please
don't add the song the middle okay cuz
it's been in my head for a week not
hating the concealer I just feel like it
definitely performs better when the
brush isn't wet it makes it really
difficult and look at this creasing can
you guys see that this concealer doesn't
do that to adding it really wet this is
like a flippity-flop or bronzer I don't
really see the point in adding a setting
powder it's gonna turn to cake we're
gonna add a powder bronzer though this
one's my makeup forever have my r14
bronzer brush let's go ahead and dip on
in oh okay
may the gods be with you because honey
you're about to go through it here we go
girl it just turned it to mud I don't
know why I didn't expect that but I kind
of did not expect that like I'm shook
and no one else is oh my god I literally
like turn it into a cream contour but
can we be mad at that absolutely not
now the thing is I think I got too much
because now it seems like a little bit
of this product is go a really long way
whenever I wet it so hey maybe you get
more usage out of your product than you
think you would whenever you wet your
brushes we may be on to something people
we're just gonna blend for three years
I'll be back whenever I'm 82 and we'll
be done blending this out 2,000 years
later okay here's the gag yeah it's too
much bronzer
I don't live but I feel like if I known
what was gonna happen I would have went
in with less Roger and I think this
would have been really pretty I was
gonna say the powder product it ain't as
bad check it I mean it is a little
aggressive but come on guys this does
not look that bad my brush was soaking
wet here's the part where I sink in my
get ugly I'm gonna go ahead and do a
polish I was gonna pick a cream blush
but I kind of looks like it's not
cheating because the products already
kind of wet so I chose to do fearless
from Tarte I'm gonna take my e4 angled
blush brush and I'm gonna dip it right
into the water
oh here I go I've never used this blush
color before Oh like so much came off I
need to go in with a lighter hand
because of the bronzer experience but
the blush is pretty on my face you know
I ain't playing you next I think this
parts gonna be really fun I'm gonna go
in with this color pop highlighter it
doesn't have a name on the back of it so
this is just our mystery highlighter I'm
going to dip a little bit out in the lid
and we're gonna wet this highlighter
brush this is my favorite Heather brush
it is an art 36 yeah I'm gonna give her
swoozie okay tapping it right in whoo
she said that country tapping it
Oh who's gonna see the new Jurassic
world movie I'm so invest in those
movies ever since I was a young little
lad I girl those movies are my living
breathing treasure
I think they should build something in
Hawaii where we can run around those
little clear balls and experience some
goodness oh no my little ball will get
trapped somewhere a roll off a cliff so
far with this challenge let me just do a
little recap I find it's a little bit
more difficult to blend the product out
and get it to apply beautifully this
makeup is gonna last all of three
minutes because I'm not setting it with
powder but this when I do is just gonna
turn to hell on earth I do like the way
it's looking I think it did make it mine
she's really gonna play like she's that
dark oh and let's move on to eyes shall
we so for my brows I always use a brow
pencil but I can't really I guess like
dip a brow pencil in there's confusion
there so I figured I would dip an angled
brow brush and use my dip brow and
medium brown I have this little angled
brush dipping her in tapping her off and
now we're gonna dip into you the dip
brow I know this is about to make my
life a turd there's gonna be a turd see
it's like hard to get the waxy product
on the brush because it's like rejecting
the wax go ahead and spoolie these brows
okay I mean I feel like the product is
so watery it's like if you barely touch
anything like a massive amount comes off
been like 10 years since I'm used to dip
brow pomade like I have not done this in
so long
Brown looks snatched though I mean I
gotta clean it up a little bit before
the most part she snatched I'm going to
now wet this tiny angled brush and dip
it in a bit of concealer Harpe out my
eyebrows this concealers already filled
with water and it's like extra creamy in
the pot so I have to wonder if I ruined
my concealer all right
eyebrows are laid and I thought for
using a cream eyeshadow some really cool
products to use would be these little
color pop eyeshadows they're always
great you know like cuz they're kind of
cream
not technically a web product but they
just have like a really nice creaminess
to them could the wetness ruin them
absolutely but we won't know until we
find out that makes no sense we won't
know until we try it so first I'm gonna
go in with drift I also have a little
bit of cute ologist oh I kind of want to
try some metallicy oh yeah that's pretty
not a warm tone Lara Lee and I warned
home that is just unheard of here we go
our 39 brush swizzle de round and those
of you asking yourself at home is was
the word well I just made it a word so
I'm going to rub my brush in this color
it seems to be picking up a good bit
here oh by the way this is hunks of lash
glue on my eye now that is a Laura Lee
signature if there's not lash glue on
her eye did she really do her makeup Wow
it's performing it's like if you can see
a bit patchy because of the water
obviously like really hard to get like
that soft blend I'm gonna go in with a
little bit more and I feel like whenever
it's not way you definitely get a lot
more pigment from these but it's like
hard to get the pigment to stick to your
eyelid and not the brush this my friend
is a real challenge you see how it's
already like detaching for my crease
this is slowly but surely a hot mess I
may have not picked the best eyeshadows
for this challenge but I really thought
it she really tried it y'all you guys
tell her my brush just went to hell and
back next I want to tap into a little
bit of drift I'm reading the brush just
tapped in some more water
alright here we go now this color seems
to be not giving me as hard at a time
which gives me some relief lid color I
don't really think we're gonna have an
issue because I wet my lip colors all
the time and actually back in the day I
used to lick my brushes to wet them
because I did not have mac fix+ however
I could have used water but that's
besides the point I wanted to use my own
body parts in order to make my makeup
little bling in using m41
brush our waters like this disgusting
film along the edge but girl I'm gonna
go in with Heine now this was part of my
collaboration in order to donate back to
the animal shelters this was a really
cool collaboration so this is hiney I'm
going to now add it on to the lid to
give it a really pretty pretty pretty
Sparkle just gorgeous darling
now hiney is a really cool color it's so
pretty I just want to go back to the
bronzer really quick I'm feeling the
bronzer and it's just fine and it's
already dried so it seems like the water
didn't mess up the bronzer let's have a
look at that blush look the blush honey
she's rocking and rolling that did not
slow her down at all okay so it looks
like the water really isn't messing up
the powder makeup which I did not expect
I'm gonna take a I'm gonna take a 410
brush little tapper I feel like I'm
about to do music like I'm going to go
in with the drift which is our cranberry
shimmer shade and now I have to smoke
this girl
hi i am i under eyes like look at this
creasing that is a flaw right there girl
under eye is like so impossible to blend
out it just looks like chunkiness am i
under I hate it Thanks I'm going to take
my roller lash and yeah I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna dip the one in the cup of
watchit ahh whoo she's only getting one
dip honey I ain't getting crazy here I
go yeah
the roller lash is just pitiful and this
is a bomb mascara but so now we know if
you dip it in water it sucks alright I
have this tart liquid lipstick I really
like this color it's called festival I'm
going to dip it in water you know it's
already like looks pretty good just like
beating the water off like trying to
reject the water it made it really goopy
like and really
feelings not living living living for it
what wow it really likes cute the
formula a good bit alright girl let me
put on my lashes today I'm gonna put on
chummy from morphe and I'll be right
back and we can have toast off this
video alright guys this is the final
look I had at a lash but let me talk
about what I don't like D'Andra is a hot
mess partly because we don't have
concealer and partly because I had a lot
of water to my concealer I think I said
we don't have concealer I'm going to say
because we don't have setting powder on
my face and that is just a Holy Grail
product when you're doing your makeup
and eyes all got it all today so the
under eye blend is rough and the under
eye mascara and lashes are also very
rough I love the eyebrows I love the eye
shadow I love the lashes I now actually
actually the foundation looks kind of
dewy and it's a matte foundation so I
feel the adding water to it actually
it's like a little trick in the tray
this video was so much fun and it was
quite the experiment I hope you guys
enjoyed watching it if you did well then
honey what are you waiting for give it a
thumbs up if you haven't already and be
sure and subscribe join us laura lee's
