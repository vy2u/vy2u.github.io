welcome to my channel I am continuing my
series where I go into a store and try
to do a full face of makeup with their
clearance and today's video is on a very
popular store that you may or may not
have heard of it is called Samara
yay I went to Sephora to do a full place
of clearance makeup I've done Ulta
Target and Walmart look back to how that
went
today we're doing Sephora so in Sephora
they've always had like at the end cap a
little clearance section normally it's
pretty darn small but when I went there
I found out different news and basically
instantly yabbering on forever I'm going
to show you the footage one quick
announcement I'm how to meet up at the
more Fiat store at the morphine's along
a store I'm reading so I don't mess it
up it is going to be on the 19th of May
from 11 to 1:30 come out get a hug get
some love my brush kit in limited
quantities will be at that store for
sale that day as well as new to patooty
cat's pajamas and the 8h and 8l palette
so the store's gonna be full stuff
they're doing lots of Giveaways and
prizes and all kinds of stuff it's gonna
be a moment honey and we're also doing
the official grand opening of that store
so it's gonna be a fun Saturday so may
19th mark your calendars come on out and
let me meet you Anna and that is my
announcement so without further ado
we'll sing subscribe song and then I'll
just take you to Sephora with me now
let's go ahead and jump right into this
video
[Laughter]
there's no clearance section find
something really great okay we're gonna
be doing this online but we do have this
sore intro so great guess this wasn't a
wasted trip huh so that's just the tape
Sephora is no longer carrying Clarence
makeup in store it is only going to be
online only in which they had quite a
large selection of discount of makeup
online which was pretty exciting to me
the great thing about it being this is
Dr Pepper you already knew that the
great thing about it being online only
was the fact that none of this makeup is
used
I never want to use me open or use
makeup that you're purchasing you don't
use it you don't know where it's been
I do it because I'm crazy but I don't
recommend that you do it when I buy it
online none of it was used so that was
just like a pleasant little like well
priced
jaysus I'm kind of annoyed because this
sell items that I got they're not
showing me the original price that has
shown me the sell price and I want to
know like how much I got off when I
bought it it did so I don't know why the
apps being weird a little weird but oh
well so I didn't get a facial primer
let's just start this video off with all
the things I didn't get but I did get a
foundation and I got this spray
foundation which I haven't used before
I've tried the Dior one but this one is
an easy professional airbrush results at
home is what it says go what I think I
paid like I want to say like 15 bucks
for this now I also bought this
wonderful
cushion foundation from Sephora I kind
of just want to dip my sponge in this
and Pat it around my face to start with
it's definitely not full coverage but it
definitely has like some coverage which
I think it looks really pretty so far
I use my y6 sorry guys but it's like the
cushion foundation just dabbing into it
with a sponge seems to be working really
well the shade is a little bit pink for
me let's see what shade we got honey
sable sand sable cyan okay and honestly
I'm just gonna do a light layer of spray
paint what does that look like this is a
shade medium that's so light huh let's
do a little more let's get crazy
oh I hope everybody had a great Mother's
Day I know Mother's Day was this past
Sunday and unfortunately my mom's in
Alabama and I wasn't able to be with her
but y'all know mama Ann on this channel
and if you don't girl check out that
video I glammed my mom I love her so
much she's amazing um my face still is
really heavy and wet with both
foundations on it looks like extremely
dewy but I think it will dry and settle
probably a bit I'm gonna hope that it
will heck's up with on clearance that a
lot of Sephora collection and clearance
but it was this Pantone concealer
palette and it looked like it could if
the quality is good like this could be
like a really nice palette I got the one
that is the correct and conceal in
light/medium just gonna dab my sponge in
this shade right here kind of thick
we're just gonna dab it out wow that's
thick
the concealer it does feel kind of
greasy but I don't I don't hate it like
I'm not like this is awful it does have
some coverage and just feel slightly
heavy for setting powder and I haven't
had a lot of luck in setting powder in
the clearance section they just don't
one of this count again another Sephora
brand product I got the universal
setting powder now I can already tell
you that this one's just super flash
back it's just one of those but let's
just see how it sets the makeup because
I mean not everyday is a photo shoot for
people so don't have to really worry
about the flash back however with
snapchat nowadays every day is kind of
like a photo shoot at least I do anyways
sometimes I take a selfie and I'm like
you literally look like a monster and
then I post it it does seem to be like
really making the makeup smooth
sophomore Matt more wearable so I like
the setting powder for that I just
probably couldn't like go ham and like
take a bunch of pictures cuz it would
probably be flashback he eyebrows look
it's another Sephora brand collection I
didn't really realize I got this many
pieces you know what let's do blush
because it's not a Sephora brand it is
this Co Sangha 22 I have not had a lot
of luck with this brand it is a it is a
Korean brand as a little sponge on the
end kind of weird ha come we're pressed
it and it's like this hot pink color
that comes out which does make me
nervous
dab it out on my sponge and I don't like
it I feel like okay let me guys I feel
like like me being awful cover G right
now and like packing on powders and
things and then putting this on top and
it just ain't gonna work it's also just
not gonna show up on my skin tone and it
just is what it is you put on just to be
a fair skin you only had a BB cream on
and there's a do a girl and you pups a
little bit of this on your cheeks it
would probably be beautiful so I've just
come to the conclusion that I just don't
think that this brand is for me I want
to tell you guys that I think it could
be for some of you for eyebrows the only
thing I can find the clearance section
was this
brow tinted brow freeze is what it's
called it's by the Sephora brand and
it's like this big marker thing wishing
that this would work out for me really
well but I don't know what's gonna
happen okay nervous Wow no one was gonna
tell me I had an eye booger none of you
Wow I feel like this product is so waxy
and I also feel like this product is
simply for people who just have like
luscious beautiful blessed from God
above brow hairs that I ain't got so we
want to I shadow because that's what I'm
gonna use for my brows today and I got
this House of lashes exa for collection
really cool palette it's like a little
jewelry box and you open it and it has
that house Alaska slash clothes you
could put your house a lobster's lashes
in them if you bought them separately
but then you open it and I do like that
was great I kind of like that this comes
out those who I don't have to carry that
whole jewelry box with me to do my
makeup I mean they're super light pastel
II colors but they look pretty cool I'm
gonna have to go in with this brown
color and try to feel in a brow because
heaney
it is named working that other brow
product over their brows to see you guys
know I'm literally missing all this hair
right here okay this is not having my
color oh I'm gonna fill in my brows and
then I'm gonna go back in over a brow
pencil and go over them to like making
more my color so we don't look like an
absolute nut because this has so much
warmth to it and my actual natural brow
hair is more of a cooler dark shade
I'm gonna take it 8:22 brush and first
I'm gonna go in with this shade right
here which is like a matte Mavi shade
and I'm gonna work this in the outer
corner and then bring it right around
like that
this shade doesn't have like a ton of
pigment to it I kind of build it up a
little bit and it's still just kind of
like that's okay because the color is
like slightly the shade of my skin I'm a
mobbing pink skinned girl what next I'm
going to tap into this yellow shade but
I'm using a r39 brush from morphe I
think I know what look I want to do
sometimes do you guys ever like know
exactly what look you want to do in your
head and then you do it and it turns out
nothing like you thought I would I'm
just gonna be real with you guys I'm
real moment that happens to me and I'm
like sometimes I get so disappointed and
then sometimes I'm like extra impressed
because it turns out even better and I'm
like oh yeah but makeup gods were with
me and sometimes I'm like wow the makeup
devil came out to play today I really
this palette is like my house of lashes
and I remember whenever I started my
channel I like always used House of
lashes lashes and I still love them so
much they're really amazing I'm gonna
put a little bit of translucent powder
so we don't get too crazy I want to grab
a little bit this warm brown shade I'm
just gonna pop that as well to build up
color because I feel like that I look
it's super yellowy still so I want to
deepen it up a little bit I'm going to
take it East 17 which is a little bit
more of a smaller detail blender and I'm
gonna take the darkest brown shade gonna
deepen up that outer corner
with the concealer I'm gonna go ahead
and carve out my our lead honey we're
going for a big cut crease today when I
go in with the lightest matte shade and
pack it on the inner corner that'd be
more noise now I'm not gonna lie these
shades I do have to build up the pigment
a bit I don't hate the palette at all
but like I would use it again for sure
it's just like the pigment is a bit
dusty and I do have to leave build up a
ton to get get these colors to show up
and I feel like a little bit patchy so
is it my favorite eyeshadow palette No
do I hate it I don't and I mean I would
use it again but just you know not my
favorite here comes the color I'm gonna
go in with the till shade and hope for
the best
okay this till shade is literally doing
nothing but getting really gross and
patchy which is so disappointing maybe
I'll try the other blue shade in the
palette of the other shade has like a
lot more pigment to it
whoa giving me trouble as well I'm
getting really frustrated I feel like my
look is messed up too because of this
crunchiness right here I think this is
about as good as I'm gonna get it I just
mixed the two colors together and just
packed them on as hard as I could and
hope for the best
um I don't think it looks bad though I
think eyeliner finally we're at eyeliner
I'm gonna use this Sephora stylographic
dynamic line eyeliner hmm I'm just gonna
have to take my time with this too and
just go really slow did just to do the
tip of the flick I did go in with the
Stila because there was just no way on
earth I tried with this the best I could
do was get in the inner corner and it
was very difficult so just a heads up
this is not very easy this is not winged
liner friendly for lashes actually found
some velour lashes on clearance at
Sephora these are silk lashes and these
are in this shit type strut it for
highlighter I got the milk makeup
highlighter on clearance and this one is
Space Jam so it's very holographic you
have like a orange e a blue e a white E
and a pinky they all kind of look
similar but the orange and blue you can
definitely tell a difference it's pretty
cool little glow there you can tell it's
like holographic but not too crazy I do
like and I'm gonna add a little bit to
my nose and I'm gonna go ahead and put
some on my brow bone and Cupid's bow as
well bronzer I got the Sephora
collection bronzing face powder and
number seven that I am going to put on
my face
lastly for lips the liquid latex are
from to face our own self from 21 to $10
so I got peekaboo and they mostly a
bunch of colorful colors or what's on so
I don't not like but they are very
sticky I'm gonna add just a little bit
of these two colors to the lower lash
line and then I'm gonna add mascara
this is the final look and I actually
like the final look a lot I like the
foundation I like the highlighter I like
how it all turned out on my face but the
makeup was a little difficult to work
with as first eyeshadow palette I do
like the palette I just have a look I
take a lot of time building up the
colors I like this having powder I just
know it's gonna have flashback I like
that
eyeliner how it looks it was just very
difficult to work with and I how to
improv and I like the lippy it's just
very sticky so you know I do like the
products on a positive note and how they
turned out it's just like there are
little cons about them there are pros to
look good I'll see you all in the next
video see ya later I'm teaching them how
to twerk with their back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
