today's video is going to be a full-face
a clearance make up I feel like this is
a challenge because I didn't go to like
a bunch of stores and find makeup on so
I only went to one store and I feel like
that's what makes this video a challenge
so that target and I was in the makeup
section shocking I know
me and my husband saw a bunch of makeup
on clearance my husband's like and I was
like so we thought it'd be a cute idea
to basically make it a challenge to do a
full face of makeup with only clearance
makeup from one store in that store is
tarjay the store where you go to and
find all the things that you don't need
but you buy it anyways here's the basket
of makeup I found like the foundation is
definitely not my shade the only blush
they had was a broken one so I had to
get it in order to do the full face
gonna be a fun video I'm gonna take this
makeup off and then we're going to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
subscribe and now we're gonna jump right
so we're gonna jump in and start with
our face makeup and I don't think I was
able to find a skin primer and that's
okay we'll just skip it I typically do a
CM primer but I don't think you have to
have to so the foundation I got in
clearance at Target was for three
dollars and eighty-eight cents it's the
Sonia Kashuk soft focus stay matte
foundation they had like a million of
the shade number and six in there and it
looks kind of it looks really dark I
also picked up some of the number seven
which I've never really used this makeup
room but this is their radiant glow
under-eye concealer and then this is for
6090 since it was thirteen ninety nine
and this was $12.99 so well I got a deal
but I think I'm gonna have to mix these
together or else I'm I'll be looking
crazy honestly this video may have been
done by someone before I don't know I
haven't seen it on the Internet I'm
actually gonna go scour and see if I see
where someone who has done it but I
don't know just thought was that cute
idea oh gotta be strong for this hmm why
is that packaging so cute okay this
shade is an absolute no for me so I am
gonna mix in I'm just putting this route
of my tantastic bronzer don't mind me
we're gonna pop out some of this Oh Rose
come on this is also what shade is this
it's been clicked and used already wow
this video is just turning into a hot
mess and then this shade of the
concealer is actually darker than the
foundation so this can actually be used
for our contour I'm gonna have to mix a
little bit of a lighter cream product in
I'm just gonna add a little bit of
concealer and with it and see what we
can make happen I'm actually gonna use a
white tin brush today instead of my y6
because I need to mix this with a small
brush instead of my y6 okay oh my gosh
okay there we go I just put a tiny bit
of some concealer in the foundation and
actually it's not that dark but doesn't
really look that bad I'm like impressed
of our hair
and I just love the fact in this video
that I am
100% betraying my glorious wife six
brushed it's my favorite foundation
brush for those of you who don't know I
love that brush but I'm portraying it
because I had to mix these foundations
together on that trip it uses white n
girl it's still the guilded collection
in memory the face foundation it is done
this NYX lid primer base so here's
what's gonna happen because my concealer
as we saw was too dark so it's gonna be
now our contour shade we're gonna make
shift and make it work I found a lid
primer from NYX for 3.48 since that was
originally at $6.99 and is the color of
a concealer I think we all know what I'm
gonna do here I'm gonna use a eyes
shadow primer just to conceal some of my
dark circles why do I feel my bones this
is a bad idea it does have like okay
it's not doing anything but on my eyelid
feels like a nice eyelid primer I feel
like I may have been used this at some
point in the past um but so far I do
like it I thought because it was cream
color like it might help me conceal my
face but that's not really the case so
while we're at it I'll go ahead and take
my number seven concealer just contour
I'm gonna go back in with this
handy-dandy a whiten brush and start to
blend it out see what happens
actually it's blending out really nicely
it doesn't seem to have that much
pigment to it so it's just putting on a
really soft faint contour which I don't
mind I think it actually looks pretty
good like overall this is not my makeup
routine obviously with the challenge
videos I think sometimes you can just
make it work and overall looks good I'm
gonna tell you guys how many times I've
traveled or gone somewhere and I
literally forgot half my stuff I don't
know how I do but I like impromptu
makeup and just sometimes you gotta make
it work I don't have a powder bronzer
because they didn't have one so next I
have this busted just this in the top of
the gap four dollars and seven cents by
L'Oreal it was thirteen dollars and
thirty nine cents I'm gonna take my wife
wore angled brush and just dab it in the
top of the lid ooh it's getting product
off so you know it's really pretty blush
too it's got like more shimmer to it
than anything it's not that pigmented
but it's pretty don't recommend buying
broken Omega ever I just did it for the
challenge just know that side note I
feel like the cash valetti is like this
is called I shaded my own broken makeup
should tell her no for highlighter I
found this NYX highlighter it was
originally $7.99 and I got it for three
dollars and 98 cents and this is like
the prism addict
Twilight tint highlighter examinees r-36
my highlight brush and if you're
wondering why I haven't set my makeup
with any powders because they didn't
have any belt okay let's see oh it's
pretty
I feel like I look like a little alien
with my little blue highlight and I love
it struck terrestrial somewhat they call
it okay like outer space
extraterrestrial terrestrial that were
just don't sound right but half the
words I say just ain't for eyebrows I
did not I totally got this little crusty
NYX product it's very sad this is the
brow cake powder this is what it looks
like
I got it probably two dollars and ninety
some since it was originally $5.99
appears that it has seen better days
this little spoolie brush thing with
brow powders it's like I don't not like
brow powder so let's go ahead and get
that out there I do like them but I feel
like brow powder sometimes work best
sometimes work best when ever you have
eyebrow hairs and you're just trying to
kind of fill in the emptiness areas with
your already thick eyebrows they're just
trying to make them a little bolder but
for me whenever I don't I have a lot
like actually fill in I feel like it's
really difficult working with powders
because a pencil can give you more hair
like real life like strokes so it's just
easier to actually fill in and I feel
like powders are a little bit more and
difficult to build up versus a pencil so
if you guys see me use pencils all the
time
that is why versus a powder but I do
like both where I can make this work
it's just gonna be a lot more
time-consuming
Brow's are on so next up is eyeshadow so
where I show I found this Sonia cashew
eyeshadow palette
it says Fleur Asian number 12 yeah verse
7 I ripped it seven dollars and fourteen
cents and it was originally $14 and 29
cents or something like that so I got it
on sale hon I first I'm gonna go in with
this peachy little shade right here
we're gonna let that be our transition
shade today then take our 39 brush and
then I'm gonna tap I'm gonna tap into
this matte purple shade guess I'm just
going to I'm like huh what do I want to
do try to pull in it in that outer
corner it is a pretty shade and these
shadows seem to be working pretty well I
feel like the purple shade is coming off
really light and pastel II I'm gonna
take the shimmery paint it does feel
kind of chalky but I'm gonna pop it on
the lid with my finger so we can really
build up the color like I said it's
filling only to be dry I also have this
color tattoo I got from 464 that was
originally 929 from Maybelline so what
I'm gonna do is like roll it out on my
hand I'm gonna use it as a liquid liner
I got this number seven like blue crayon
pencil which I'm gonna use about water
line and probably smoked out on the
lower lash line I got it from 498 and it
was originally at 999 it is really
pretty
but take a more Fiat 326 little smudger
and just smudge this color across the
lower lash no my darling I'm gonna take
some of the darker blue that we use for
liner and kind of smudge that as well
ball to lippies both from NYX they're
both around three bucks so I'm going to
take off my lip chopstick stuff you want
to apply this matte one it looks really
pretty
it's called Dutchess but you know I
gotta put on some lashes so ah be right
back well I popped on some lashes these
lashes were not from the clearance bin
um but we'll pretend that they were just
kidding we won't did you guys know I
just always laughs you totally don't
have to do that you just pop onto
mascara this is the final look I like
the way that makeup came out especially
with the hand I was given a clearance
makeup not all cleaners makeup is bad
it's just like I needed a lighter
foundation and I need you some powder
and stuff like that but we still made it
work I think that eyeshadow turned out
really cool really pretty I liked how we
mix purples and blues and pinks so I
hope you guys enjoyed it I know me
personally I'll stop blabbering just a
minute but I know I used to whenever I
started my channel I did have some
makeup and not a lot and I wanted to
keep introducing new makeup into my
tutorials and things I was doing so I
would always shop the clearance section
and I would always dig through and find
so many goodies and talk about on my
channel and be able to use them and that
really helps me like the clearance
makeup really helps me kind of build my
channel and build my career and makeup
and so I couldn't afford to just go in
and just go ham and start buying even
drugstore I couldn't buy all that
drugstore makeup I absolutely couldn't I
was in college I was working full time I
was living on my own I had a car payment
you know rent I pay for everything
health insurance like everything artists
makeup was a savior to me and I know
it's like so incredibly cheesy to say
this video is kind of near
near to my heart but it kind of sort of
is in that way because when I look back
you know clearance make it was like
literally something I counted on and
there are so many times that Ulta and
Target and Walmart I would dig through
the clearance section and find my pieces
so it's kind of near and dear to my
heart I know that's weird but I'm just
going to film a little story with it I
hope you guys enjoyed the video give it
a thumbs up if you made you want to go
out in that clearance section and see
what they got I love you guys thank you
so much for being here and watching
subscribe become a lolly today and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
