I stupid
Oh for me
I love twerking have you guys know I'm
the best twerker in the world but it
doesn't mean I don't like to do it we
did the other day I was like um do any
of your guys who's randomly start
working because I do that all the time
and so many people were like actually
yeah I do the great thing was it was 21
days of beauty I think it still is going
on with Ulta the 21 days it'd be B
there's tons of really awesome BTW sales
this video is not sponsored uh I just
went in there at that time so those
clearance section was like bugging out
with a ton of stuff yeah but I just hit
myself in the face I got a ton of like
uLTA Beauty products that I really
haven't tapped into and released right
out my channel so I'm excited to see
like the Ulta brand stuff this whole
palette was $9.99 and so I just want
tests now I mean the eyeshadows look a
little I'm weary I also got like these
little sample bags they were on the
clearance bin says it was $88 oh my god
is that real with these really $88
there's no way I'm for $12 like 12 bucks
let me show you look at all this makeup
it's like the old CBT brand so for $12
like that's a hell of a deal a lot of
this one might be a win the other one we
had a finagle a lot of products to make
it work I've talked enough I think it's
time we're just gonna jump right into
this video start glamming hunty hunty
alright let's jump right in the first
thing for foundation I found these at
L'Oreal visible live serum as whoo
absolute foundations they were
originally $14.99 I got for 749 so they
were half off I bought two shades the
shade looks about 10 shades to light the
shade looks a little bit dark so I
bought both of them in hopes of mixing
them together so we would have a
concoction that would work the only
thing I didn't buy was a facial primer
you know what I'm just now realizing
that this got pumped out I don't know
how I missed
happens to me every single time so I'm
only gonna do two pumps of the lighter
shade and about three to four pumps of
the darker shade this one's brand new
just gonna blend this out and I think
look at that color yes we like concocted
our shade and it looks pretty good like
it's a medium coverage foundation but it
looks pretty on my skin and I do like it
so far
so girls so far so good we're in luck
we're doing good next for concealer I
picked up this Rimmel um hide the
blemish concealer and soft honey I don't
it's not used there's no markings on it
but I don't see the price but I know I
got it on clearance I had so much stuff
it was weird how like when I saw that
clearance area so full I was like really
excited this concealer it feels super
lightweight so far so I'm just gonna add
like half the tube on my face so I'm
gonna take this brush and create it with
a multi and I'm just gonna blend this
out wow this stick concealer is blending
out like nicely thank heavens I mean I
will say like it is a little Creasy so
I'm not like living for it but as far as
for the challenge honey we're getting
the job done and someone please tell me
how every time I do a challenge video of
any sort I don't have a setting powder
how does that not get that active the
sooner I get a whole face and makeup and
I was looking at these and girl there's
not like a setting powder so I'm kind of
screaming on the inside right now so
she's gonna be very Creasy today alright
moving right along I got this little
blush and bronzer palette which is
really cute and it came in the little
goodie bag sample bag thing take my r14
brush a lot comes off which makes me
nervous because I don't have setting
powder on so I feel like it's gonna own
oh honey it's gliding wow it's pretty
nice okay now you say that lately
co-leads
album like I listened to it non-stop I
love it
don't like like the slower smooth music
that's just normally not my type but oh
my god his voice it's so nice like in a
perfect world I would have Khalid
playing in the background as I do my
Maker right now we could all just jam
out together but girl the world ain't
perfect but I take my e4 angled brush
and just tap into the blush shade it's
pretty for highlighter in this kit
there's a little highlighter shade that
I feel like oh I'm pulling my hair I
feel like I must try out it does look a
little bit light but girl it's just what
we got so that's what we're gonna do
today
why is that so pretty sometimes when I'm
so tired and I just feel like poop and
do my makeup I feel like I'm literally
polishing a turd this highlighter is way
too light for me I'm just gonna say it
because when you look at me straight on
you see the ashy nose right here it's
just cuz it's too light but in general
the highlighter is very pretty and I
actually didn't even put on it that much
it's just very pigmented which is nice
for eyebrows I picked up this Mabel on
Mabel on Maybelline precise brow pencil
this one is in the shade deep brown for
$7.99 I don't know what it was it
doesn't say the was price but I'm pretty
sure these are more in general than
$7.99 so I'm gonna say I got a deal
I got this little tinted eyeshadow
primer it does have a bit of color to it
but I do need some eyeshadow primer down
so I got this little palette out of the
set she's good I also got this little
Maybelline palette for 497 and I have
this little kitten caboodle right here I
take it in five seven three in this
neutral cream shade and I normally start
all my looks with a cream shade like
this to kind of soften up whatever
primer I have down and it really helps
the other eyeshadows to blend out by the
way I like the brow pencil but I don't
know if you guys can tell it's super
waxy so I find that my eyebrows do look
super drawn on if that makes sense they
look a little bit harsh I think that's
just because there was so much wax in
the product and then hey today it
wouldn't be like I go to brow pencil for
me just because of that
I'm gonna grab in at butterfly wings
which is this pink mommy shade on the
same brush except I'm gonna take out r39
and try out a little bit of this purple
shade and hope that it's not a hot mess
I feel like deep down this putting this
purple shade on right now is a bad idea
what I'm gonna do it anyways
oddly enough this purple shade is
literally turning into a black blue I
have no idea how that happened
so just a warning like this Maybelline
palette is very deceiving in color it
looks like I tapped into that dark blue
color in the palette but I didn't I I
swear I'm just using that purple shade
and it just
honey it's blue like this ha player was
purple but underneath with dark blue
then we have dark blue here I don't know
what's going on let's take this light
pink shade it kind of looks white on
screen but it's actually light pink I
take it in for it too one brush then I'm
going to start pressing this onto my
eyelid I'm gonna take on this little
pencil brush a highlight shade just pop
it on that brow bone and inner corner
got this brow pencil out of the kit and
this is not a brow pencil this is an
eyeliner I swear to god I know how do
you make up I'm gonna line up here with
it
next up I got this mascara out of the
baggy kit I literally have hogs do my
makeup cuz I do a really quick meeting
like at my house
wait so for my eye I'm gonna take a
little bit of this bronzer color and
just honey I'm just gonna bump it inner
to outer also let me go in with some of
the purple shade and just buff it really
close to the lower lash line
and then I got this purple eyeliner from
maybelline and I got it from $5.99 to a
dollar 47 that is a deal and I'm gonna
pop it into my waterline oh did I not
mention that I put on lashes you guys
know I do it every time you know I can't
myself you know I have to add the lashes
and me adding that eyeliner to my
waterline did absolutely nothing like
literally nothing it just made my eyes
super watery so I mean why I got this
um face and body glitter from Ulta for
three dollars and 19 cents
and I don't know why I just want to add
a little bit to my eyes like I just feel
like do you ever want to do something
really bad but you know you shouldn't
well that's kind of how it's going right
now but I want to so I'm going to have
some on this dampen brush and honestly
you are cool they go I just oh I didn't
wait too much sparkle but it's pretty
like I just want to do something
different when I got glitter what I'm
fine I want to let my nice I mean I
liked it before for sure I'm just no
enhancing we just went from sexy dinner
date makeup to Coachella got this uLTA
Beauty pink chocolate lipstick in the
little gift set it literally almost just
looks like the color of my lips and this
is the final look what do you guys think
I like the way it turned out I just need
a setting powder because this is
creasing and it feels so sticky and it's
not gonna last long but if I had a
setting powder I'm to add to its like
the look would be super complete and
just goes to show you again you get a
full face of makeup with clearance
