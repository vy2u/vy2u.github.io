it's my mic working guys I film so many
intros without my mic working and it
makes me a violent never I go to edit
and I've filmed the whole video with no
sound so if you see me peeping over I
also people the screen to make sure I'm
in focus because so annoy whenever I'm
talking about focusing it's very
distracting for you guys so just that's
why I'm peaking over at the viewfinder
I'm not checking out myself I know what
I look like and some days it is rough
okay that was a weird intro let me start
over
hey guys what's up and welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be a
full face of makeup that is underrated
to me first of all so much makeup comes
out like it's absolutely unreal and it's
absolutely impossible to even try to
even kinda keep up with it I can't even
keep up with it and it's my job but I
have come across quite a few products
that just are really really really
really really good but they just don't
get talked about a lot on YouTube now
you guys may have heard a youtuber talk
about this you may have seen these
products before but they're not hyped up
you don't hear people running out to get
them you don't see the craze about it
like you do about a hooter or a fin team
or fee even you don't get the current
the craze but I think the products are
just as good as some of those brands
products so I want to talk about them
and not only talk about them I know you
guys like whenever I try it on my on my
face as well so that's what I'm gonna be
doing I'm gonna be putting on my face as
we go and we'll talk about like why I
picked this product on why it's not
talked about and so on and so forth and
yeah that's my video idea for today I
normally try to pre film two or three
videos in one sitting but lately I'm
just filming one video day so I've
literally been filming a video a day for
like weeks and I'm like I'm actually pre
filming right now because I'm going on
vacation babe a friend's trip titty
that's all the announcements I have not
what that was an announcement but that's
all I got for you guys so we're gonna go
ahead and jump right into the video I'm
gonna sing this is travel early now we
can go ahead and jump right into the
video
she heard snick don't record me this
close man all right let's start off with
primer and talk about some primers that
are just absolutely I'm under graded not
over it's up to one I believe I
mentioned this in my best of beauty of
2017 what year is it 2013 on Catrice
this is a really nice pore refining and
anti-shine primer and I really like this
because I think it's somewhat
moisturizing and it doesn't have that
silicone feel to it so it's an
interesting little primer and I think a
tres is pretty affordable at the
drugstore and then LC is a really great
brand no I talked about this in my
products that beauty gurus create it
it's just a really great pearl radiance
primer I don't see it talked about a ton
I don't really see it talked about
almost at all but this is awesome
awesome I really think that this one
does a good job of helping with the
pores just a little bit just like a
little blur factor in it so I go ahead
and press that into my skin I don't know
if this is in my head or not but I just
feel like whenever I press makeup into
my skin it like pushes it into the pores
and like putties the pores so you can't
see my skin look flawless okay for a
foundation this is a new one for me to
recently be loving and it took me
forever to test it out because I am just
a much of a bandwagon err if I hear
people raving about something on my girl
hallelujah let me test it out you know
this one I just haven't heard much about
I know people have talked about before
but again it's just not hyped up its
underrated so it's the cooky skin
perfect HD foundation it reminds me a
little bit of the Make Up For Ever
foundation the HD one shade is a little
bit light for me so I'm gonna go ahead
and throw that out there but we're gonna
use it anyways because the only shade of
it that I got I have a clean y6 for once
in my life it's not filthy
go ahead
shrug this on the skin in the messiest
way possible do as I say not as I do I'm
on being like I'm finger-painting today
I don't know so I'm just gonna blend
this in but this foundation has a bit of
a lighter coverage too but you can
definitely build up the coverage too
which I like a lot
I like buildable foundations because I
feel like with buildable foundations you
get options it's not completely matte I
will say this about it it's not like the
world's longest wearing foundation so be
careful with that and be sure and set it
if you do get it and wear it pour
concealer now this is a very popular
brand but the like this brand setting
powder is the hot poppin ish but the
actual concealer has never talked about
especially this one in the pot this is
secret concealer for the under eyes and
three-point-seven comes in this little
pot by Laura Mercier and like I said you
guys know the tea on the setting powder
it's like the best ever but actually
this concealer to me is like seriously
one of the best at honey it will cover a
tattoo I believe does feel a little bit
heavy but the coverage of it it's just
unreal and I really like it so with this
I'm just actually gonna apply it with my
finger you can prime your eyelids with
it too it's just a really great product
I know makeup artists use it as far as
like the beauty guru world and youtubers
you just don't see it raved about or
talked about or used consistently it's
all about NARS which I'm guilty of and
tart shaped tape or the Kylie at the
color pop this is like insane coverage
and just a tiny tiny bit go such a long
way which is why it's in such a little
nugget jar go for powder I really like
this brand I think it's gonna be
up-and-coming this is the the Frankie
rose powder in porcelain which is the
lighter shade which you can dust lightly
OOP look at that you can dust lightly
all over your face and it makes a nice
setting powder has a lot of pigment to
it and this is a powder that does not
flash back so of course what's not to
love about that you get a lot of powder
off like if you tap it like so much
comes off so you can set the under eyes
with this I'm actually gonna lightly set
my whole face with it and it has like
this cream shade to it but if you can
see
it's kind of translucent on the scan so
the works are really nicely I'm using it
III brush to set my face in case you're
wondering okay next product I've
definitely talked about my channel is
the makeup geek bronzers makeup geek
used to be like everything under the Sun
it still might be but I just don't see
these talked about like ever so I
definitely wanted to show them some love
I mix tani and Sunkist together it's a
medium and a fair bronzer so this one's
more fair but I need just a little bit
of depth to it but this one's just a
little bit too dark there are really
really really beautiful bronzers I love
the texture of them and they don't get
patchy at all but like I said I'm kind
of in between shade ranges so that might
be why people feel the way they like
don't talk about as much because I can't
get the right shade which happens
sometimes
he's our 14 brush and go ahead and
bronze up my skin with these actually
travel with these and use these all the
time so good okay don't get four Oh
bless actually have a more view product
so the brand is overhyped
I get that I understand that but I feel
like this product the bang for your buck
that you get that this just isn't talked
about enough all the 35 oz like all 15
versions of that and all of the
different eyeshadow palettes that come
out or just talked about to death and
their brushes I'm guilty of it myself
but as far as this blush palette this is
one of the most beautiful blush palettes
I've ever seen in the quality is amazing
this is the 9 in and you get like every
beautiful blush you could ever want in
this palette shimmer and matte and the
price is unreal I just don't understand
why this isn't it talked about just as
much as that eyeshadow palettes but it's
not so I typically use this one right
here and sometimes I mix in the middle
this is it's like a gold reflective to
it so it's very pretty guys are like oh
if you don't shut up my morphe okay I
just wanted to say that this palette is
really gorgeous no image is it I mean
that's been mentioned before like I said
it's not like no-one's ever talked about
it in her life on YouTube but I just
highlighters our highlighter that it's
so pretty
I get stuck in a rut with highlighters I
got finding one that I love and then
I'll just use it for like a month
straight I'm sure to look some love to
this one this is moon dust whoops
Boop this is moon dust highlighter from
ciate and hmm they're all the
pigmentation that comes off these like
you have to go in with such a light hand
because they're insane I'm guilty not
hook mouth Oh know why I haven't talked
about or even used some more knowing
that I love them it's because I get it
like I said I get stuck in a rut but
they're really really really pretty and
I think everyone should try them out
they're so beautiful so underrated
they're for eyeshadow I have two
different things to talk to you guys
about first are these new color rain
mini palettes I thought these were gonna
be like the most reviewed thing ever
because the Queen of Hearts palettes was
like the best palette ever like oh my
god like wanted to eat the palette it
was so great but these just really
weren't talked about that much and I was
like I will say I don't die for the
packaging I think it's cute how they all
match and like are all different colors
I think that's cute but these weird
flower things are a little strange to me
that's a personal opinion I'm not trying
to reflect that on you make you feel
like you hate the packaging but I just
don't like it
spacey underwater in outer space had a
baby I don't know
once you open them up lemme let me show
ya let me proto yeah you like the color
scheme of that one that's the smoky one
this is the love lies lovelies I don't
know how to read you guys to that
friggin idiot and this one is the rust
Beautyrest I use this one actually a lot
I love this one and this one is very
cute see what they did there this one
having used a lot but it's very cute
really quickly I wanted to mention these
cream eyeshadows these are from jcat
these are really cool this is pris
metals they are like metal eyeshadows
I'll show you some swatches so you
believe me you see that now are you
Shiki wookie are you sho ki wookie when
you see that do you shake they raved
about dang I always try and keep the
plastic on I should
mirrors the long as I possibly can so
that way whenever I travel with the
eyeshadow palettes whenever I pop off
the plastic whenever I get to where I'm
going I have a fresh clean mirror with
no makeup on it because normally
whenever I travel I end up using the
mirror that's in the palette so it's
like I'm savoring the mirror for
whenever I'm in a traveling time and
need a fresh clean mirror do you give
I'm saying I know that that's a little
bit of a strange thing but that's just
like something a little quirk that I do
I also in like compacts like like this
one from Frankie Rose it has like a
second compartment I'll put like rubber
bands and bobby pins in there and that
way whenever you're carrying your powder
out and about to an event to touch up
with you also have a little rubber band
and bobby pins or even a q-tip if it'll
fit and your powder compact it's the a27
soft little brush I'm just kind of
buffing this shade around and really it
just sets the eyeshadow primer that's
arty down from the berry palette I'm
gonna take this peachy shade when I take
out r39 which is a little bit of a
smaller blender so we can be a wee bit
more precise with this color and I'm
gonna oh my I know what was gonna
explode okay we'll just blend that out
for like 10 minutes until it's uh not
looking crazy my forehead keeps on I
don't know if you guys see the little
bumps they're like tiny little bumps and
it keeps on breaking out but it's like
just little bumps and they're annoying
and they don't do anything they just sit
there and piss me off I don't know what
to do about them if you guys have some
great suggestions for these little bumps
I probably just need to get a retinol
and get over it and just dry out my skin
for just a little bit and get rid of
them I'm gonna take recharge on the same
brush and I'm just gonna deepen that
crease a little bit more with this color
these colors have like insane amounts of
pigment so I suggest if you get them and
you're using them to use the lightest
hand that you have to work with like
girl do not get crazy I'm gonna take
this shimmery purple and I'm gonna pop
it into the crease
I'm gonna take a dusk in the e36 pencil
brush and just really define the crease
just deepening it up bit more I'm gonna
take it m41 which is as you guys know my
favorite brush to cut the crease with
and I'm going to cut my crease using a
little bit of concealer
I'm gonna keep this lighter shade and
put it on the lid I don't know I'm so
I'm gonna keep the shade because I'm
crazy and I can't get it together
would you guys really love my channels I
had it all together though I mean be
honest newcomer to mic oh baby you're in
for a long wild ride guys I'm just gonna
pop this on if you guys can see how
pigmented and pretty these pallets are
I'm actually gonna take some of this
Urban Decay glitter which is probably
the most talked about glitter on the
market and I'm sorry that I'm using in
this video I just want to be creative
and I'm going to like line the actual
cut crease like such it makes it pop now
I want to attempt to do a glitter liner
with glam rock I line up
or my lower lashline I'm gonna go back
in with a little bit of kiss berry then
I'll add some recharge and then a little
bit of dust
I'm gonna apply an eyeliner that may or
may not be coming soon first lip
products go there are a lot that I
talked about and but this one I isn't
talking about that much if ever and I
think it's like the best these are the
NARS these are like liquid lip stains I
forget what they call them they come on
lip pigments so much pigment it's unreal
but they're really not talked about that
much I mean I just haven't seen reviews
and things on them so I'm gonna be using
the shade and get it on incredible
amount of pigment they smell good and
they're really comfortable
seriously with these like you barely
have to use any India like extreme
pigmentation so they're fabulous
check them out that is it for this look
I think it turned out really cool what
are you guys thinking really beautiful
with products that just really don't get
that much love and I wanted to do a
little bit of a creative look so I did
throw in the glitter I hope you guys
don't mind that I'll glue the glitter is
talked about but I do love you guys
thank you so much for being here and
watching and I do hope to see you all in
my next video be sure and subscribe to
my channel before you leave and I hope
you learned about some products I mean
some of you meant like I said may have
heard of these products but they ain't
hyped up thank you for being here
watching and I will see you all in the
next video so you guys know what level
crazy amount I just closed down my video
with no eyebrows on because I forgot to
do my eyes I just shows you that I'm
crazy and that I got 10 million things
going on in my head oh my Jesus help me

eyebrows on now this is what I like I
