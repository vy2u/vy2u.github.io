god the tag is still my shirt but
nobody's got to know welcome Marley's
how are you doing today hi kids Owens so
first up in this video if you want to
skip through this little part you
totally can but I just want to say
YouTube is changing things up a little
bit and they are now not sharing all of
our content in the subscription box
they're only gonna put the videos in
this subscription box that they think
that you want to see our personally
thing is really stupid because I'm like
if you subscribe to the table and they
obviously want to see my content but
YouTube thinks that they know more so
what you want to see than what you know
so I can't wait to someone higher up in
YouTube watches this video and just
slaps me my personal content I would say
the only way it's been affected is my
view start off slower but throughout the
week they end up being the same because
people have to come to my channel I've
gotten thousands of tweets of people
being like why your video not my
subscription box and that's because
YouTube is changing up the game a little
bit I've seen a lot of fuss about it but
yeah just turn your notifications on and
they will notify you so basically if
your notifications on it's a way around
it and so anyone you're subscribed to
including me turn your notifications on
by hitting the Bell and they will notify
you every video that I upload versus
what they think you want to see when I
upload I think it's so controlling with
social media tries to pick and choose
what you get to see you follow people
for a reason so that's obviously what
you want to see now that the annoying
stuff is out of the way let's move on to
the content moving onwards with my
series from going to a store and digging
through the clearance section and trying
to get a full face of makeup you guys
requested that I go to Walmart next and
I hadn't been to a Walmart in four years
and the reason being is because where I
live in LA there's no Walmart around me
I had to drive for 45 minutes to go talk
which was totally fine I had like the
best time ever stay to the end for
bloopers I did get all of my face makeup
they had more than target hat and
clearance makeup which might be very
exciting but
to dick for a long time and it was kind
of gross at some point let's just go
ahead and jump into the video so you can
see that t-shirt subscribe Yeley let's
go ahead and jump right into the video
we going to Walmart we going to Walmart
sing out a Walmart we going
did you find it
this is the only section in Walmart
everything else literally walked up
can't even get in it
apparently people still a lot of makeup
Ramallah
let's dude not a good start
so basically I'm having a hard time I've
only found one concealer in here and
it's not my shade no problemo
and the makeups really dirty
I'm gonna have to get a little creative
but tell you too much so I'm just gonna
show what I got as I go through the
makeup tutorial the products I got were
not products that I would typically pick
up on myself and use but you know she
had to make do so basically I go in and
look for a foundation a concealer and
whatnot to get the pool face so let's
get started put my little mirror up
I bought catnip mist which is not for my
face first product I found is from all
made this is their healthy glow gradual
self-tanning makeup it was oh it doesn't
tell you how much it was but I got four
1297 tried this stuff out when it first
came out on my channel and it was
alright I didn't like love it
makeup has two pumps half Foundation
half gradual tanner really weird
concoction colors not bad do you guys
remember last time I got in a little
situation with the shade I gotta say
this stuff is really like shiny and
heavy feeling on the skin but it does
have some coverage so I'm happy about
that
apparently I didn't find a concealer
from the drugstore so I'm kind of like I
did but it's not my shade this was three
dollars this is the Maybelline New York
fit me Oh bitch this sill was broken
okay we can use this to contour but I
don't have a concealer today so what I'm
gonna do is just add a little more
foundation for my dark circles I'm using
a white in brush I use the y6 for the
foundation these are like my favorite
face brushes they're from morphe you can
use michael arlene this is pretty though
like this is blending out nice though
that contour shade is right i'm gonna
have to use this more this is shade 30
cafe it's gonna add a little more of
that foundation right here i found for
$3 unit price 1071 what this elf powder
was never 1071 wal-mart you need to
settle it down it's also been swatched
it's also not my shape Laura you flopped
I don't
what's going on why doesn't say unit
price is the same as my cell price I'm
gonna scream if they ripped me off is a
really pretty stick blush a highlight
blush thing it's been swatched I'm using
used makeup can't wait for me to break
out into a rash or something that'll be
exciting well that didn't really do
anything on my face so don't try this at
home if makeups been used please don't
buy it I'm the only one that's doing
that okay I got a Maybelline bronze
blush for four dollars that was 780 is
six let's see that seal was broken and
if you can see right there it's been
swatch take out our 14 brush I typically
use this brush for bronzer cuz I'm gonna
set that cream bronzer now if you're
wondering how I'm gonna set my
foundation I'm not because guess what I
don't have anything to set it with and
that is just part of this challenge
where you just kind of make things work
blush bronzer is very pretty I mean I
like it so that's that's good I'm
looking very bronzy today I'm here for
it honey I'm here for it found an ombre
blush I'm gonna try out it's purple
$4 it's 250 here we go
and guess what it is sealed closed this
is the first I think the first item
today that I'm using that hasn't been
opened it's kind of cute though I like
the pink and all in it so I'm just gonna
take a wipe or brush oh yeah that's a
pretty blush it's kind of purpley pink
but I like it moving on to eyes I found
this eye primer from Maybelline that was
seven eight uh Dallas
Dallas is now it's four well someone
needs to go through the Walmart bin and
throw away all use makeup okay so this
one isn't used it's definitely still in
its pocket which makes me happy I'm
gonna go ahead and apply this to my
eyelids
girl they're trying to tell me that this
Revlon eye art was $45 in what world I
got it for 450 thank God I didn't pay
$45 for it geez I also got this
covergirl
I'm compact they're saying this was $11
I got it from one dollar we're gonna
have a vibrant eye today because the
only things that they really had on
clearance were things that were like
loud
I'm gonna take my in five seven three
brush I'm gonna tap into the minutiae of
bronzer I'm gonna use this as a
transition shade when I take this blue
shade from covergirl takes me back to my
elementary school girl days I had one of
these compacts just like this but it was
lavender purple and it was the only
eyeshadow I had and I wore it to school
every single day from my eyelid to my
brow bone I'm just lavender purple it
was like I want to see was junior high
school and I put on some mascara honey
girl she was a mess
she thought she was flyy it's all in
your head as long as you think you're
doing good
then you're doing good taking an hour 39
brush I'm just popping this right into
my crease and then I think I'm gonna
take that revlon $45 eye product and i'm
gonna put it on my eyelid not really
sure how this is gonna turn out but my
options were so limited so i think i'm
gonna start off with the dark blue oh my
gosh that's very pigmented and very dark
put this all over oh Jesus am I supposed
to put it with this am I supposed to
blend it out take a white eighteen brush
and just kind of smudge that out
sorry but that rub one thing is so
freakin pigmented as a cream eyeshadow
like that's wild
I've bought really high-end cream
eyeshadows that don't perform like this
so props to Revlon for this product now
there's like this sparkly side I figured
we could just add a couple sparkles to
the mix yeah why not right for mascara I
found a $2 mascara that was worth $2
from Rimmel London the mascara actually
seems pretty nice so goody-goody well I
actually like the mascara a lot so you
guys can go ahead and take this off the
clearance band I got this L'Oreal
palette that was 13 bucks for seven
bucks it's been open but it doesn't look
like it's been touched so that makes me
excited I'm gonna go for this nude shade
since we've got a lot of color on our
eye area the color is pretty alright the
only thing I didn't get is an eyebrow
product and I look like an alien right
now
so I don't even have a brown eyeshadow I
could find to like fill in my brows with
I'm not feeling my brows and be right
back
technically I'm cheating but and yeah I
couldn't find it they didn't have it I'm
gonna do
all right I cheated out of the last two
this is the final look and can I just
say like I love the look which is so
weird I think my skin actually looks
really beautiful it's even without a
concealer like I swear my skin I love it
I think it looks super cool ah we as
well as the blush was so pretty like
rosy on my cheeks like I adore it eyes
like I'm literally gonna go find more of
these Revlon things because they are
amazing and they look so pretty and
nicely blended on the eye and then we
made the blue eye shadow work with it
look I love the weight look mascara was
great the lip product looks pretty with
the eye look like the only thing I would
literally just gone Walmart and looking
for a little more as a lash because I
love my lashes and a brow product that's
it though but I literally like girl we
made this work even though half the
makeup was juste girl we just made it
work I love the look I love the way it
came out like I would go out with this
um I would add a little bit of setting
powder to my under eye just so that
doesn't get crazy everything turned out
really beautiful and whenever I use a
lot of cream products on my face like I
did today I love this like dewy realness
and shine that you get so and I'm
excited about it because I use products
I typically wouldn't use so I love the
way it came out I'm this challenge I
think came out even better than the
target challenge and it was even more
than a challenge however I know my
eyebrows and lashes are not from Walmart
and I'm sorry about that but I dug for a
really long time anyways be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
turn on your notifications so you can
actually sign it yes and I guess
