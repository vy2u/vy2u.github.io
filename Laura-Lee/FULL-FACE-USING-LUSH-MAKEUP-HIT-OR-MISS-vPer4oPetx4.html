much let's do this let's roll
always put a little lip product and I
lips for you to start it so you guys
will have to look at the crusty crust
FYI this is a Lancome lippy for those of
you who might be wondering looks like
this don't know how absolutely I'm so
low I don't know okay I'm going to put
my hair off my face
Real Talk moment I don't really know a
lot about lush product so I did
screenshot I bought all these author
site and I did I did screenshot like the
little detail about it the first thing
we're going to try out which scares the
crap out of me because just opening it
up and looking at it I don't really
trust it it's called dark yellow color
supplement aka I believe it's trying to
be a foundation this was one of their
deeper colors and it still looks kind of
light they have a few colors on line but
I was like girl these look like so I
just went and got the shade dark yellow
cuz I was like maybe it'll work this
color supplement is for Sunkist olive
skin me yell at home complexions me
the skin tans easily me so that's why I
got this one it works brilliantly to
even out skin tone and create a
beautiful matte finish with silky soil
Sol all the haste and smoothing stuff
okay you get it let's go ahead and dab
some on our skin it feels like a nice
soft whip you see it still looks too
light it's like way too light looking
but it describes my skin tone perfectly
so I'm already a little shook there I
mean which I'll do in we're going to
roll with this tutorial
whether it's not my color or not because
we're trying to make things happen today
okay those way too light so not really
trusting their descriptions just real
talk moment it does feel really soft on
the skin but it feels like a thick ass
heavy moisturizer and it is too light
for me you like see streaks of it it's
like took away all my pan it smells a
little weird and it just feels like I
put fake moisturizer on my skin
great just trying to build a little bit
more of it up because it doesn't really
have much coverage to it it is still so
thick cuz I greased just being honest it
feels like grease that being said next I
have the emotional brilliant now the
link that's what this is called and it
is a translucent face powder so we're
going to set my agrees be shiny face
with this pink powder mattifying powder
for all skin tones
here is our translucent mattifying face
powder suitable for all skin types use
it over the foundation to set the look
to create a shine free finish using
ozone to even out skin tone for a
natural look yeah go you can use it on
as home but you can use it with any
foundation I'm gonna take and brush
drill big so I'm going to take a morphe
III brush super pink powder so we'll tap
a little off into the lids we don't get
too much
smells weird and I feel like it's
lightening the foundation a little more
so pink I know if you guys can see a
little bit of pinkness through here um
it is helping the fill of the foundation
because the foundation was heavy honey
heavy as they um with this on top
honestly it feels better the foundation
feels better I look pink and I look
super ghostly but I don't feel it sticky
so and I did use a lot of products if
you can see a pink dividend down in
there to get that mm-hmm yeah we're
right okay moving right along I don't
have any brow products in um yeah I
don't have any girl products so let's
move on to we have eyeshadow eyeliner
mascara to work with - really pretty eye
shadows how smart sophisticated last
night at sophisticated and Happiness and
they come in these little to make up a
little doe foot applicator it's like a
little pre cream eye shadow it says its
long-lasting and I swatch it on my hand
it kind of did last for a long time
creamy smooth long-lasting shimmery
taupe cream eye shadow blends well with
other colors and can be worn as an
eyeshadow or a liner whatever you can
imagine just a cream eyeshadow it's
basically what it's telling me
so we're going to try it out I'm going
to dot it on like I normally would and
then just Pat it out with my finger
once you put it out it's pretty it's
subtle for sure but it's definitely
pretty I think these are $20 a piece go
and I mean they're pretty but I feel
like Maybelline has some cream
eyeshadows that are similar for cheaper
but they're not all natural and cruelty
free so that's a thought yeah so we're
going to move on to the golden one on
one eye I know Mel look crazy but the
point is to test this out see what the
sophisticated that's the name of this
color is
subtle more subtle than the hand swatch
because you can't just let go a plunge
and then be like okay we're done you got
to Pat it out a little bit trying to
layer it up to get more pigmentation
going on I mean it's pretty like no
doubt it's not my favorite thing in the
world
it's kind of pricey it's 19 bucks but
this sides dry and what I do like about
it is that it's not creasing at all let
me add a little bit more to get some
more pigment out of it now it looks even
better it's like a little topi bronze
pewter moment on my eye here they're
pretty where they're not like amazing
I'm gonna leave it at that and move
right along next I brought this really
cool eyeliner this is bothering me
having two different eyes so I'm just
going to go ahead and put the pewter
color on both eyes now that we've seen
the gold and what it can do it says take
a deep breath and apply our baby blue
liquid liner it's bright tor quotes and
reminds us of a tranquil tropical seas
so it doesn't really say much about it
it's just this little liner it's kind of
hard to maneuver these handles because
they're so tiny like grabbing on and
trying to like finagle them the liner
brush looks okay it looks like it's an
eyedropper but actually this part is
hard plastic so it's not an actual
dropper it's just like a gripped it's a
little tube and now this eye is dry
we're going to go ahead and try to do
some liner and see what happens
oh come on blue let's see what happens
here
definitely have some pigment but it's
like so wet
whipped filling and creamy it's all my
lashes and it makes me want to throw up
because it looks so chunky I just ripped
out some lashes great great yeah this
it's just like not it's a whipped
formula I'm telling you guys it's not
like liquid liner it's I whipped liner
so it's kind of like hard to get it on
your eye without coating your lashes or
like getting it it's very pigmented
gotta say I wish it wasn't in my lashes
was up this man does not look good so we
have blue eyeliner now not easy to work
with
it was chunky let's move on shall we
next we're gonna be trying out right
eyes this is their mascara with fresh
wheatgrass to condition your lashes now
this one is the shortest one I've ever
used to simple mascara one so I don't
know it looks kind of watery I'm
skeptical right now guys I'm freaking
out a little bit I'm freaking out
beautiful gentle mascara made with fresh
wheatgrass already read that to you
thicken and won't smudge to go on the
build it up for a dramatic look got it
you guys know I don't like reading
instructions you know that about me you
know literally this one is already
annoying because it's like using I don't
know what it's like using oh it's watery
it's like water you see like it's like
putting black on my lashes yes but doing
nothing else it's almost like a lash
tint because it literally just got me
looking like a crazy mm-hmm honey no
like even the bottom lashes this is not
build up mascara this is a water leaky
mascara I'm not a fan obviously I don't
think I have to say it much more all
right cool it like splattered all over
my face moving on to lip products shall
we about to and I'm going to try out
both for you I brought
hybrids and charm charm vibrance is a
little out but we're gonna try it out
and then charm as well so lay off see
what he has down it says it's a liquid
lipstick vividly pigmented warm bold
apply sparingly for a new tour look you
can build it up cool so let's try out
the orange one a fur it comes with a
little short doe foot applicator huh
like a low key starting to look like a
clown but it's cuz you know I just
bought this stuff and I'm like just
Chuck testa now you wouldn't have to
wear blue liner with the orange lip if
you don't want to I'm just testing it
out guys not really trying to do a
beautiful complete look for you
obviously this one tastes kind of it
like has a nice smell not really tasting
it but it's very sheer and shimmery kind
of says that it is so in the description
so it adds up to what it says it's going
to be it feels super nourishing it feels
greasy but like it has a lot of
nourishing properties to it
it applied somewhat easily easily it
says it sheer that you can build it up
that's what it is
I don't love the color but I'm not mad
at the actual products so here is a look
at by brands and now we're going to try
on charmed okay here we go
this one is like more matte I think this
a little doe foot applicator why is it
like why Dallas girl lush got me all
kinds of messed up up in here
they got me a confidence up it feels
gritty like sands in it great it looks
really pretty right now cool so I hate
this color I'm just gonna say it these
products honestly know like what into
what would the foundation all doesn't
feel too terrible on my skin actually
right now the colors are so far off and
I how to use a setting powder with it
the cream eyeshadow you know they were
okay they weren't that bad
there are $19 but they're not like the
end of the world actually don't crease
and they do dry down so I'm not mad
the liner is just too thick and whip and
it looks chunky mascara as a joke the
lip products this one feels like sand is
in it and very gritty on my lips the
other one didn't so much feel like that
I just don't love the color so that's a
personal preference not just like facts
and yeah so I would say this is overall
big bust I want so silly but anyways
