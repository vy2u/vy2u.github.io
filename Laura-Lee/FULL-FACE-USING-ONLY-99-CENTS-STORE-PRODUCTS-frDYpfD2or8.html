video is going to be a quite interesting
one because I went to the 99-cent store
and you guys know I am a Dollar Tree
girl so I can't cheat it on the Dollar
Tree here I picked up his mini makeup
products as I could fine I went to I
think the biggest 99-cent store in LA
but yet they didn't have a lot of makeup
options and I wanted to do like the full
face of makeup with only 9 I sent makeup
but I couldn't found that foundation
there's one or two more items I couldn't
find there might be one or two products
I have to use but I will use the
cheapest form of this products that I
have um because I couldn't find
everything we're going to go ahead and
jump in the video be sure and subscribe
to my channel boom yummy so strong I'll
jump right in the video so one of the
products I didn't get was a foundation I
couldn't find one in the store period so
I'm just going to use this affordable
Maybelline matte and poreless and then I
did find a foundation powder which they
only had one color in it which I didn't
understand I guess it wasn't options and
it doesn't even say the color who are
this about to be a video from hi oh this
is what the foundation powder looks like
I'm going to fill it feels really soft
very pigmented and probably a little bit
light I'm not gonna pry my skin because
I don't have a primer either Laura what
do you have this is one of my favorite
drugstore foundations by the way in case
you guys were wondering who I'm doing
this like I've never done makeup before
just gonna dupe I got way too much
product on here why did I do this to
myself alright there we go that's better
I'm gonna blend that out who this shades
a little light for me okay girl she got
a taya she could say we're starting off
the video video the video we're starting
off the video is me cheating going to
apply this foundation powder on my face
using the sponge that it came with so
the powder feels nice it just there
wasn't
okay now that might be a little dark
what's going on with my skin coloring
today this actually feels kind of nice
y'all I'm not mad about this
the sponge is leaving it a little
blotchy so I'm having to put in a little
bit of elbow grease to get blend it out
nicely hmm I think I look flawless fresh
flawless flexion of that I think I look
flawless fresh and flat girl we lookin
good nine essence oh you better watch
out we'll go ahead and do eyes there
wasn't a 99-cent store brow product
either I haven't really watched these
videos yet but this everybody have
everything for the night and store in
their video or is it like here and there
I'm going to use this new Revlon brow
pencil which by the way I've really been
loving lately eyebrows check I don't
have any eyeshadow primer on deck so and
I couldn't find any obviously but I did
find this no makeup 21 nude and neutral
shades what does no makeup me whenever
it's full makeup I don't really know
what they were going with that marketing
gimmick Qaeda yeah I found this palette
there and it smells so strong like it
smells like my grandma's basement if
your grandma or do you have a basement
that's exactly what this would smell
like this smells like old potpourri in
books how it looks like it might have
some potential and we're about to test
it out and see what happens
I've been using the morphe 27 brush and
I'm going to tap into this yellow matte
shade not too Shaba and then I'm going
to take this little matte brown shades
kind of hard to get your brush in there
and we're just gonna pop that in that
crease is that pigmentation I'm talking
about it smells so strong next I'm gonna
take my e25 brush from sigma and grab
every time i swish the shadows around
the smell gets so strong guys I promise
I'm not being dramatic like this is real
talk I'm just gonna pop her in my crease
oh well she pretty
oh I've used a lot of eyeshadows in my
day and I have experienced high in
eyeshadows that couldn't fall out this
pigmentation come on now
99 am
yeah guys I'm sure I am shook right now
whoa next time I hate this little brush
from Revlon right here and I mean what
color I do I want like my options are
low-key endless here I kind of want to
do like this rosy pinky purple color
right here it's got some of my brush
right here hey it's okay though so bad
still not mad at the palette yet so I'm
actually going to take a little bit of
this silvery shimmery shade right here
and apply it on top I'm going to grab a
little bit more of the deeper brown
color she's really deepen up those outer
B's next up I did invest in this gold
palette and I know it says 299 but I
bought it at the 99-cent store and I'm
pretty sure I only pay 99 cent for it so
I want to grab a little bit of whatever
that color is just one okay not much is
happening there I thought maybe it would
get more no okay cool so we'll leave
that eyeshadow long now and now we're
going to grab a little bit of our
eyeliner which came in this palette and
actually the only reason I bought that
eyeshadow palettes cuz I had a mascara
eyeliner in it kind of feel like the
dollar tree has more options in makeup
that's just me though that's just me
okay nothing's happening so I am having
to get a little aggressive with this
liner to get it to come off not my best
eyeliner work but it was doable for the
amount of pressure I put on my eyelid to
get that eyeliner to work dadgummit now
I'm going to take the mascara that came
with it it just says mascara so
I've used worst mascaras this isn't that
bad it's not the greatest in the world
but a darn sure isn't bad not gonna lie
it feels a little bit like it's dried
out this product might be a little old
but still I'm still not mad at it it
could have been worse
look at these lashes I know they grow
downward I know okay I know
lucky for me I found false lashes at the
99-cent store and I found two pair that
I am NOT obsessed with honestly but
these um these are a little weird and
then these are little long so I don't
know what to use I feel like I'm gonna
use the little strange ones
it comes with glue too so they're super
strange I don't recommend these lashes
they're very bizarre and fakey looking
rather than like I don't know like wispy
and like someone natural oh this lash
glue it smells so strong like chemicals
like I cannot put that near my eye I
know my eyeball and I know that it's
going to be pissed if I put that near it
some duo lash glue on this little baby
right here all right so these actually
lashes I mean they definitely don't look
natural they're kind of strange but
they're doable I don't actually have a
concealer from the drugstore or the
99-cent store so I'm using this super
super super affordable this is the LA
girl and Siller I think these are like
five bucks I wish I had a dollar store
one now I'm going to take a little bit
of that powder and just set the
concealer I mean it's a little dark but
the actual powder isn't that bad jace
low weighs less a bargain now I'm going
to go back to my no makeup palette and
I'm gonna grab this this bronzer is just
as orange actually going to get creative
and use this little eye shadow right
here and use it as my bronzer you just
have to get some on my brush well oh god
the smells getting really strong so the
eye shadow is kind of looking a little
orange too huh
oh now I'm going to dip into this blush
from the palette
it just looks white no alright so I'm
going to take this highlighter shade
which is it oh god I know I keep
complaining about the smell but it's
getting so strong the highlighting shade
is um kind of like nothing it looks like
a white powder I probably could use that
tickets to set my concealer and that
would have worked out better by the way
that contour turned out really Orange
and kind of harsh
yeah next for lips I bought this
lipstick the color of it I'm not living
for but we're going to try it out and
see what it's all about okay this is not
my color felt this would be like a pinky
nude and it's more like a like a white
you need to use some chapstick color
alright guys so my overall review of it
is the products are definitely hit and
miss and there is not a big selection at
the 99-cent store of makeup this eyelash
over here is stabbing me in the eye
every time I blink and I just want to
rip my whole eyeball we know what you
think in the comments and also share
with us if you had any products in the
night eyes that store that really worked
out for you we might need to know about
it save our dollar bill show or spend
our dollar bills really
