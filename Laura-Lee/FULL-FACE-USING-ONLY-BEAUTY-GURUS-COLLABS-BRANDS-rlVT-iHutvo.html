actually greasy and shitty looking isn't
that amazing
Oh Lauren Chang she's washing her hair
now what is up guys welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be
different than before you today I'm
going to be doing a full face using only
youtubers collabs or youtubers make up
creations whether it be their online or
if they come up with another brand I'm
going to use it today there is one
product I don't have that a youtuber has
not created yet so youtubers where we
yet though
myself included a youtuber has not
created a setting powder
now if that I can think of like I've
looked and looked and looked and they
just can't come up with a setting powder
that a YouTube created or Instagrammer
or an influencer had created someone
like she's my own but other than that
setting powder Oh or concealer so we are
looking for concealer I said in color
guys where we at go anyway with that
being said that was just an upfront
disclaimer girl she will be using her
own concealer Shoei be using her own
setting powder not a collaboration or
influencers sorry about it also comment
down below if I missed that like if
someone created one I just missed it
that also could have happened because
you know I'm Lala and I'm a little bit
cry cry anyways before we get started
we're gonna go ahead and sing a little
song my snaps were terrible and now
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video
I straightened my hair today instead of
curling it and I kind of like it what do
you guys think
I normally straighten it like once a
month and then I leave it curly the rest
of the time I don't know why I do that
because training is so much faster but
well the baby kittens crying okay
mamacita
you can give me a kiss oh she's being
camera shy today nope she just wants to
be destructive in the video and be
camera shy I brought you guys in up
close and personal and first we're gonna
start with priming I'm hosted concealing
my face we're gonna start with priming
the skin and today I'm gonna be using
the LC pearl radiance primer I haven't
really used this on my channel I've been
using it in the past few days and I have
been enjoying it actually so this is
actually by Lillet and Lily it wasn't is
an instagramer and she also had a makeup
studio has a makeup studio but she
created home makeup lying off of her
studio and Instagram and it's called LC
and it's really pretty
she's also as a foundation I haven't
really played with yet but it's been
raved about on YouTube so I need to try
that out as well it says shake it well
woah give the good little shake I'm just
gonna end it feels someone moisturizing
and a little bit a poor poor feeling
next up for foundation I'm big using the
huda beauty foundation and I really like
this foundation it smells just like Avon
did my grandma used to use the Avon D
hand cream of Avon that's an identical
smell like identical it like brings me
back to my grandma's house in Alabama
I'm gonna be using the shade 300 in
today and for the beauty we didn't know
she's an instagramer and she has like 20
million followers
she is a shout out page and then she
created her own makeup line off of that
but she started I don't think she
started as a shout out page I don't know
her full history but I think she started
as a shout out page like I think she
started as her own and then kind of grew
the page into that I will say like a
little bit of this foundation goes a
long way like I find that I don't need
to pump out nearly as
much of this liquid foundation as I do
my other ones like this just goes a
little bit further I'm going to take my
y6 brush from morphe and I'm going to
just stipple out that foundation I find
that has medium coverage it's very
moisturizing I went ahead and I look a
little crazy I went ahead and added a
little bit of setting powder as well as
concealer so now I'm gonna move on to a
brow pencil and you might be saying who
the hell came out with a brow pencil
well if you didn't know I'm actually
endorsing the benefit my precisely my
brow pencil and number four well I'm
actually endorsing all of the shades if
you go into Sephora you will see that I
am on the packaging so that counts right
you guys are like kinda I think account
so I'm gonna be using my own product and
yeah I'll link it down below so super
exciting
what kind of special every time I use
this I feel real special I'm not gonna
lie so if you get it or you see it at
Sephora you see me on the gondola girl
just just snap a pic tweet it to me I
want to see you seeing me it's a special
moment
so first I'm going to use the Nicole
Concilio exit volleyballs palette I love
this palette so much and congrats cool
now I'm in focus and congrats to Cole on
this palette I think it's so pretty and
it is a back and stop so I'm gonna use
the shade Daisy it looking like this
you'll see that I'm just gonna apply
that all over with the m5 35 brush I
think that Daisy is such a great shade
to apply all over and kind of soften up
the eyeshadow primer or whatever you
have down to primary eyelids stays he's
just a good shade for that medium skin
tone girl oh yes mama I really loved
Nicole Concilio I can't remember the
first time I met her but she's such a
sweet person her NIC like the nicest
people ever and I really enjoy being
around her she's such a positive person
has a really good energy to be around
next I'm gonna go in with boop bop which
is one of my favorite colors it's like a
pukey brown colours what I like to call
it it's just such a good color so I'm
gonna apply this in the outer corner and
just really buff it in I'm using the
same brush that was using before hand
we're just gonna go outer inner to outer
corner
boop boop boop boop such a cute name
next I'm gonna go in with chocolate
which is at this cooler brown color it's
like a nice expresso shade I'm gonna use
this with our 13 and 9 and I'm just
gonna pop this on the outer corner just
to deepen it up a bit this is such a
great brown shade
now I'm gonna jump into the Jacqueline
Hill eggs morphe palette which I'm sure
you guys have heard of this is such a
great palette and I'm going to take this
purple shade right here normally I
wouldn't use this shimmer with the r39
brush but I'm going to with this look
and see what happens because I really
want it to be buffed out on this outer
corner so let's see how it performs
come you just purring I'm gonna take my
em up for two one two one two one brush
with a little bit of concealer on it and
just hit that eyelid
next I'm gonna take this light shimmery
shade right here out of this Jacqueline
Hill palette and I'm going to pop it
right on top of the word that concealer
is a placed hey hey hey
she's on the mic this brush is great
really rounding out your eyelid right
here kind of give it a nice cut a crease
look I'm gonna be like a half cut crease
semi cut crease kind of moment here and
I do hit the colors with a little bit of
mac fix+ I just don't think it helps
with them sticking down better you don't
have to do that I'm going to take an e36
brush I'm gonna go back in with that
purple shade and girl we got a buff out
that harsh line right there you know it
I'm gonna take a number 20 brush from
ABH and go in with retrograde right here
this black shade and I'm gonna pop it
right there at the waterline because
this is gonna be our liner it's gonna
help our lashes to blend a little bit
and now I'm gonna take the Big Shot
mascara which make up a Shayla collabed
with Maybelline on and I apply this to
my lashes next I'm going to apply these
Lily lashes these are our Lila and these
were a collaboration with Laura Boudreau
her name is Laura she's a really great
Instagram I'll put over here somewhere
but she created these lashes right here
and I think that they are so pretty I'm
going to go in with hey girl which is
that warm tone of brown shade with this
little 43:36 just making up names I'm
just gonna blend that enter to the outer
corner and I'm gonna grab the purple
from the chocolate uh morphe palette
with the same brush and just go ahead
and buff it right underneath there as
well now I'm gonna go in with my big
shot mascara and I'm gonna go ahead and
hit those lower lashes
next time I'm gonna take two bronzers
from makeup geek and if you guys didn't
know Marlena was a youtuber she still is
a youtuber charge me so post video
somewhere Lina is a huge tuber that
created mega bleep make oblique makeup
geek she created one of the first lines
of makeup from a youtuber which i think
is so cool so I'm gonna take tawny and
Sunkiss and mix these two bronzers
together from her makeup line and apply
those on my face next I'm going to take
this blush from DISA colors and it's
called amazement oh I get it open gotta
be strong sometimes so it's a really
pretty peach blush and if you guys
didn't know dosa puss owned by Anna who
actually fallen Instagram before she
even started to sew colors she worked at
Mac I believe and she was just so really
she is a grill I always talk about
people and paste past tense because I
feel like once their brands are so
successful they're now a brand owned or
not in well it's ever there's still an
influencer so anyways Anna is it really
tells him makeup artists and short
format shows like a pop has a pop and
Instagram with really cool beautiful eye
looks and she always inspired me I think
it followed her since outlet Alabama so
where I might be wrong I think so
anyway she created dose of colors and
yeah she is an instagramer that started
just colors
for my highlight today i'm gonna be
using none other than the artist couture
illuminati if you guys did not know
Angel Marino which was a Mac Daddy on
Instagram created artist couture he is
with a Mac artist as well and he got on
Instagram and has a fabulous Instagram
account and then he created arts couture
who has me and Angel met each other in
Cabo I believe like a while ago and I
just love him death he is such such such
great energy to be around and he is one
of the people in the industry who has
accepted my weirdness I think the most
of anyone almost he always has this
saying around me look at laura-leigh
being Laura Lee because it's just me
being the GUP all day I am at anytime do
anything silly or crazy he just goes
Lorelai's being Laura Lee like because
I'm so I think I'm like super super
super myself whether it's cool or not
I'm not always a cool girl you know not
always super hip and cool and do what
everybody else is do and I feel like I'm
always myself and I am just a goofball
like I'm a knight and I okay with that
and I feel like Angel has I don't know
he always has the sayings with it and I
think he really appreciates my goofiness
a lot so I'm gonna go ahead it wouldn't
take Illuminati and pop it in that inner
corner as well as on the brow bone girl
her lashes lifted oh my yeah Oh Louise
gonna go get a break so pissed next I'm
going to take none other than mannequin
from Jeffrey star and obviously you guys
know he's one of my friends in the
industry
he is a youtuber and Jeffrey's has been
on social media longer than any of us so
I'm gonna take his look a lipstick and
mannequin alright guys that is it for
this video this is the final look I
really really really love it the way it
came out I think influencers make some
of the best makeup on the market and I
say that because I feel like we're under
a microscope whenever we come out with
makeup and I feel like so many eyes are
on us and so many people were just like
waiting to see every little thing that
we did and every little piece of the
work so I think a lot of pressures on
influencers including myself whenever we
come out with makeup and
so as like influencers deal with every
brand from drugstore to the highest high
in testing out reviewing I feel like
influencers work with makeup putting it
on every single day they teach makeup so
they know it works so I think some of
the best makeup on the market comes from
influencers and I'm just so happy for
all of us and I'm so happy for the
success and a lot of these people are my
friends in this industry and I'm so
happy for them and I think it's so great
that an individual can become an
entrepreneur based off their own dreams
it's absolutely amazing so I wanted to
do this video really to support people
and show you guys some really great
makeup from influencers who either
created their own brand or collaborate
it and created something great I love
you guys thank you so much for being
here and watch and be sure and subscribe
before you leave today and I'll see you
all in my next video
