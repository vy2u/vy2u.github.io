random today's video is going to be a
full makeup tutorial using only elf

hard time getting someone to work this
eyes watering so we're going to pretend

situation okay

thank you guys so much for coming I
appreciate it I love you so much I love
you so much and it's like a look I
decided to try to stick with my let my
go to look good I do if I have events
over going out I want to be glam I
normally trying to do like oh no I
switched it up a lot but this will be
the most go to I can give you like the
golden eyes what is one most I would say
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave this post a lot of cool
awesome amazing videos and I don't want
you to miss out okay to finish your
scarf one round down bow and we're going
to go ahead jump right in and get
started
my stomachs growling I'm so hungry about
to go order some Chipotle okay
my first name I start off with is some
elf daily hydration look at a nice
little moisturizer it feels kind of
thick so I'm really weird about putting
stick moisturizers on my skin so in all
honesty this is too thick for me mike is
right off the bat cream so I'm going to
go ahead and use this primer mist
oh god this thing is it shoots the
product out so strong and I knew that so
that's always trying to like back up so
far
oh skin oh crap I'm going to go in with
their foundation sound and then shade
light a medium never use this product a
day in my life and I'm excited to see
the outcome oh it's liquidy yeah also
serum but it's like whoa I'm going to
get some on my g36 brush from morphe
this is like really economizing the new
Knicks foundation but we'll see if it
builds up like that foundation does it
is like water how did you drop down my
pants and as I said I'll never get that
out of my pants what's interesting is I
kind of think that the year 2017 is
going to be a year about skin and like
showing off your skin and maybe going a
little lighter with the foundation see
what happens but I just see the trends
that keep happening and the Kardashians
are really showing off their skin and
runway shows like skin skin skin you see
the beautiful freckles real talk with
y'all I put this on my face and I see no
coverage and I feel crazy yeah I'm gonna
always keep it 100 which I'm gonna work
on my brow to have this little elf just
it's their power wax brow kit and I'm
going to use my own brush
not too shabby it's a little bit dark
for me but this sounds all alright
alright alright what I did there is I
just mix the pomade in the powder
together and they should pretty much dry
on my skin so it don't feel as greasy
and take one of my favorite products
from ELF this is their cream contour and
highlight palette I like to paint this
white hand brush from morphe just into
the little highlight shade just pile
that on honey we get some coverage out
of this I'm not obsessed we using this
yellow as a concealer but our like s
coverage in highlight but I don't have a
concealer on deck so no more using it is
not too shabby but it's like super
contrasting with my skin because that
foundation had no coverage hate my more
PG 31 brush dip into that nice cool tone
shoot real
I'm going to use this trusty elf
High Definition powder product will
flash back on you on camera but oh my
god are you kidding me
and I'll just literally dumped out on
the floor I was everywhere
no what I was supposed to do I don't
have a powder bronzer for mountain I
have to go in with this little palette
right here and the mix these two shades
together this is a new palette it's the
shadow brow and liner palette on this on
top
oh my beyond it something I'm going to
use a little bit of a highlight shade
for my eye primer knees the maid format
- palette and take a shade right here
with some more feet East 17 and bloom
that right on in the crease peg and do
little small flickers in the outer
corner and then just kind of blend it
back and forth in the kree going under
palette called matte imma take this red
color
back up way now I'm going to grab this
little Toki your brown color right here
I'm not sure you don't get all in that
crease
I go into metallic palate I'll make it
I'm going to make these two shades
together and I grab that warmer brown
color I'm just going to dust this color
on the lower lash line so going to from
the inner to the outer corner just kind
of smoking it out a little bit and then
I take the deepest ground color that's
in the outer corner and just do the same
thing but really keeping it on the outer
corner of the eye a lot away you're like
why didn't I make so silly sultry so I
take these wink and bold lashes from elf
they recently came out with new lashes
Crisco low drizzle would happen because
you know the other ones are just way too
fake you for me looking these these are
a little better than fine
your that rain feel like storming right
now I thought it was the lash glue first
but I'm like it's dry in the top of
these bands for some reason are gray
which just looks crazy look at this why
are they gray I'm about to cover a
little bit of my liquid liner because
that is gonna drive me crazy I'm Greg
gray in the bad way I mean it's a little
wonky but that's better
all right let's I have Rosie can buy elf
I'm gonna take nicely nude and add it
right in the center
that's not least for a high that I'm
going to go in with it Jim oh no this is
whether baked highlighters and I've been
highly informed that you have to wet
them before you use all or else they
don't work oh there's a little highlight
there she goes there she blows
yeah see what I did there so my overall
thoughts of this look is I feel like a
lot of the makeup I had a really
manipulate in you know work really hard
to get it to work appropriately the only
thing I'm obsessed with was the
eyeshadow was great the brow turned out
great but I had to work so hard to mix
those together and it took me so much
longer than normally
good the foundation is nice if you
really like your skin to peer through
because the did right now and the
contour kit as far as the cream contour
I love that I already mentioned that I
love that the highlight was way too much
trouble than what it was worth at like
dig my brush in and soak my brush and it
was just barely come off so I don't
really recommend not the lashes were
much prettier but they have the white
band on them which is so awkward in my
eyes watering right here so we'll just
pretend it's not there are q-tip
products without but there are a lot of
products it was just like so much work
to get them to work we're done oh my god
love you guys and I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
