today's video is going to be a fun one
because I'm gonna be doing a full face
of foundation even my eyebrows even my
eyeshadow and even my lips yes I'm going
to literally I have my tray actually
left over from where I mixed all my
foundations together if you haven't seen
that video check that out so I still
have my tray of foundations and I'm just
gonna you know go into the tray also
have some stick foundation and we're
gonna do the makeup with the full face
of foundations this is an interesting
challenge I actually saw first Tina
tries that do it not sure if someone
specifically created this and it's
always a touchy subject like I always
say comment down the person that you
think created this challenge and um we
can show them some love in the comment
section
I saw Tina tries to do it she did a
really cool job she used the nards
little sample ones which look like this
um so I might use one or two of these to
mix some shades to create some cool
shades yeah that's what we're gonna be
doing today a little bit of a weird
video but weird is fun and we're gonna
be having fun together
and I challenge you to do this because I
think it would be really cool the only
thing I'm gonna use it's not a
foundation as I might hit it with a
little bit of setting powder because if
I don't this is literally just gonna
slip and slip around especially with my
eyes and eyebrows it's just gonna buck
so that's the only thing I'll use it's
not foundation and I'm really excited to
see like how I do this challenge and how
it's gonna turn out I'm not promising
anything great but we're gonna hope for
the best so without further ado I'm
gonna go ahead and sing the subscribe
song and then we're gonna jump right
into the video
now let's go ahead and jump right into
the video
okay so we have some bad news
I washed and Oh nope nope nope here it
is I washed all my wife's sixes cuz you
guys know I like to collect these and I
just found one of my jorts dirty but
it's fine I thought I didn't have one on
hand and I was too lazy to get up and go
get it okay okay so first we'll start
with obviously just putting foundation
on my face like normal today I'm going
to be using it these you weigh a
foundation this foundation is like the
most full coverage foundation I've ever
used in my life I just added some on my
y6 and I'm going to dot it on my face
and then I'm going to blend it with this
brush guys look at this coverage this
color I'm using by the way is bronze but
what I like to do is to blend it in
small circular motions which gives you
okay this color might be a little bit
too dark for me but we'll pretend that
it's not but this gives you more of an
air brush stroke free finish we're gonna
make sure and get the neckline that way
we can pretend that the foundation is a
too dark for me and we'll just bathe my
whole body in it and it will trick
people into thinking that I have a
little bit of a tan that I've been on
vacation in the tropics but really I've
just been filming videos okie dokie
artichokie so the great thing having all
these in our samples is I don't really
have a foundation that's super light and
I just need one to conceal with or
foundation conceal with so I'm actually
gonna go ahead and pull one out to do
that I'm gonna use light four point five
the foundation looks kind of good but
girl that's your way foundation is no
joke baby if you like full coverage
that's your girl right there
okay so we're gonna go ahead I love this
little spatula oh yeah NARS makes the
best this is probably like it's weird
concealer but and that best concealer so
I'm counting on you so when I go ahead
and apply that
oh it's like watery because it's
foundation not consider Oh almost
contoured with it lord have mercy
yes what I got I know how to do makeup
okay so I went ahead and like
highlighted in my face in the area that
I like to highlight and now I'm gonna go
in weed what should I use I'm gonna use
this Bobbi Brown foundation this one is
in shade warm almond 6.5 and I'm gonna
contour with it so a little down the
nose I love cream contour I don't do it
as much just because it's another step
and it takes a little bit longer and if
I'm being real I do my makeup pretty
much every day so you know I get a
little tired I'm gonna take a wild guess
it's such a soft fluffy brush and we're
dealing with a super liquidy product so
it's really great to work with so I'm
going to blend out our concealer
foundation oh my god why is that like
really pretty it looks like a concealer
guys I used that NARS foundation and it
looks really good
how interesting and a little bit goes a
long way so I kind of feel like a little
bit too much on my forehead
I'm just gonna blend this part out with
my finger so we can get a little bit
more specific okay and now I'm going to
take a white ten brush which is a little
bit of a more dense brush and a little
bit more smaller so you can be it
somewhat more precise with it to blend
out this contour this stick foundation
is a little bit of thicker product so
it's a little easier to blend out
whenever you have a denser brush so I'm
going to be using the white in
go away just uh playing it away I'm
going to take an m5 7/9 and because this
is a little bit more precise we shaped
it's perfect for the nose contour so I'm
gonna blend out that she used a lot of
product on her nose so it looks like
she's been brown-nosing you guys know
when brown-nosing means I'll let them
explain that to you in the comment
section alright now that my face is um
you know foundation fight it looks so
good to me I'm sorry besides my nose I
gotta add a little powder which will
lighten this up this looks so good to me
it looks beautiful actually this is like
a super highlighter and contour skin but
it's like really pretty to me okay shall
we move on for eyebrows I'm gonna take
this icon it London foundation stick and
I'm gonna take it has a big long hair on
it
you an r44 angled brush has a nice
little spooley on the end and here goes
the brow part so now we're gonna say a
little soft prayer for Laura and hope
that it all works out well okay we're
not gonna use that scratch that we're
gonna go to one of my guitars little
samples why do I feel like I'm gonna
have to use the shade it's the dark
number six shade from NARS and I'm gonna
use this for my brows so it's kind of a
liquidy air product but let's let's try
let's see what happens
I don't know if I showed you guys the
color I forgot I think but that's what
it looks like thing my looks really good
now this isn't specifically the color I
would typically go for I tried probably
could it go went a little bit lighter on
foundation but I think it looks really
good that shows you how much pigment is
in these foundations I'm gonna take a
white 21 brush and this Lancome
foundation and carve out my brows
I'm gonna take an r32 brush and the icon
in London pigment stick and because
we're dealing with cream product that's
why I'm using such a dense brush but I'm
gonna start like buffing out my outer
corner and we're gonna try to finagle
and make like some type of pretty eye
shadow like she's got like this gorgeous
bronze smokey eye I'm actually gonna mix
in just like a tiny touch of that
foundation that we use to blend do our
eyebrows not blend right well why don't
you messed up
I'm gonna go back to that really light
shade that we use as concealer take a
dot and apply that to my eyelids I'm
laughing because this is just so funny
I'm gonna take a little bit of
translucent powder on a loose brush
because girl we're about to have a mess
on our hands so and plus my eyes are
already creasing pretty badly so we're
just gonna set it all right I'm now I'm
gonna put on some mascara and lashes and
then we will continue onward with all
lips
for my lips I'm gonna apply some of the
huda beauty and I'm just gonna use her
finger hmm she went nude y'all she did
nude lip I'm actually not gonna add
false lashes just by the way I just want
to do like natural lashes today
call me crazy because I am but I'm going
to take some of this pigment stick and
just bombs it up this this feels wrong
on so many levels
it just stay right the ones that
actually are pretty nude and that's it
for this video this is the finished look
and why is it kind of pretty I did not
expect this though I expected it to be a
train ride but actually like even the
brows look good the lip color looks good
that I show those good yeah it's kind of
pretty I don't know tell me what you
think down in the comment section right
down below and I again challenge you
