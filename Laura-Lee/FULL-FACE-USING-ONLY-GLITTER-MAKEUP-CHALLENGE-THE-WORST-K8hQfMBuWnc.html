I've already done it and wash my face
hence the glitter that's in my hair ears
nose and eyes which is gonna be in my
ears nose eyes and hair probably for the

the STD of makeup which think about that
yeah that's true

win a MacBook I will jump right in the
video watch me destroy myself to start
with I'm going to put up my hair because
we don't know it's gonna be in the way
if I don't
next I'm gonna apply some of my Mac
strobe cream I just my skin's dry and
then I feel like it'll stick better onto
like a cream I don't know because we're
about to put this all over our face it's
gonna feel horrible plus strobe cream if
you can see it has like an arrow doesn't
glow to it my skin just dry because I've
been using a retinol and it's like I
guess the question I have is like what
do you put all over your face like what
color should I look that up and looks
like people are using siller's Moss I'm
gonna put some matte fix
it's the brave feel like I could just
like now I'm going to take this glitter
injections because obviously this is
just going to work better however these
smells so strong like wax crayons and
I'm probably going to use this whole
entire thing the skin is going to love
my after this like I'm slaying this
challenge
how much glitter is gonna get my eye can
anyone guess huh so this is a New Year's
Eve makeup tutorial if you ever want to
outshine your friends this is a good way
to do it do you ever get a new
highlighter and you do like one swatch
of it and then you realize you need a
little more and then you need a little
more and then you need a little more and
you end up looking like this well at
least this is exfoliating my skin I just
got past the toughest part of this
challenge I feel and that was the whole
face interested to see the aftermath of
how I'm gonna get this off of me let's
move on let's do um some of this pink
color same glitter injections like
because I feel like the cheeks need some
blush oh pretty oh my good every time I
breathe in I am inhaling glitter
therefore that mean want poop out
glitter is that what that means that
would be cute um now we're gonna do the
eyes I want to do like two different
colors on the eyes really fortunate to
have these by the way for this challenge
I feel like they're definitely helping
me make this come to life I'm going to
use my Sigma e 70 brush this is a great
angle to make a brush that is going to
be it see this stuff doesn't really work
on makeup brushes it just works on your
finger well this one's dried out guys
these try out shoot Oh see I'm gonna put
this one on the outer corner because
it's like the deeper glitter has darker
glitters in it and then I'm gonna put
you just got to do it with your finger
this is the no brushes challenge as well
how many of you guess I was gonna do a
tongue click there some of you know me
too well some of you know me
well I just heard the doorbell ring and
that means my Hardee's is here but i'ma
keep filming okay now I take this really
pretty golden color and I will put on
the lid this one isn't dried out so if
you can see that it's like 20 times more
pigmented I feel like mine isn't turning
out that bad what do you guys think make
sure you're commenting down below with
my commentary that's beautiful so for
the eyebrows because hair is like
involved I felt like it would be easier
to take like a liquidy glitter this is
the heavy metal glitter from Urban Decay
almost said Urban Outfitters but it's
not a clothing store it's makeup and
these are some of the best products that
you can buy with your money
especially if you're into glitter if
you're not into glitter with an
obviously it's not but if you are my
friends my family my subscribers will
love these I just want to just use it
like a brow gel you know to take the
wiry hairs we don't want my brows to
take over this look we really want the
glitter to be the main focus someone
comment down below and tell me what TV
show that songs off of comment down
below if you know we still have too much
brows I'm gonna take the volleyballs
glitter glue best glitter glue and all
the land I'm actually gonna go ahead and
plaster them down this is I I want my
brows to be like a fun color do I really
want to be brown or we'll come back to
brows cuz I feel like there's some
patches missing up here that I need a
contour so I go back in a lot more
support now I'm starting to look like a
clown I see what's happening here you
guys at home are like she looks like a
clown so this is just an everyday makeup
store for you guys to try out um it's
very simple it's very easy you can wear
everyday okay I'm going to use this
chocolate swirl glitter from above also
this is one of my favorite glitters I'm
actually I'm gonna use a makeup brush is
an e30 brush from Sigma I'm just gonna
pop it right onto the
ooh this is brown you know and my
eyebrows are brown get it to get what
I'm doing here tell me to be praying for
me right now
cuz we both know this is not gonna end
well for me I want to do my lips who's
excited about my lips I am so I know I'm
obviously gonna have to put down a gloss
first I feel like the best way to do
that is take frostbite which is you ways
new lip topper and it's like you see how
shimmery it is it could pass for glitter
these tastes and smells so good and now
I'm just going to put some glitter on
top I'm gonna do the pink yeah that
looks good for pink lips
how much glitter am I gonna eat by the
end of this probably a lot if my poop
comes out glittery I'll take a picture
of it for you
face feels like it's covered in glue and
sand right now in case you're wondering
at home we add a little more glitter in
the spots luckily none of this has
really got in my eyes yet like I'm not
feeling it in my eyes you know whatever
I listen to my own voice you know who I
remind me of Danny McBride cuz it does
anyone know who Danny McBride is if you
don't you don't you should watch more
comedy videos you know editing my videos
listening to my own voice I'm like girl
you are the female Danny McBride the way
I'm gonna put on false lashes whatever
false lashes I put on I probably little
ruins they'll be covered in glitter
these are some Lily lashes I'm not 100%
which ones these these are because I had
these laying around
I just want to wash my face so bad right
now I just I just squirted out enough
lash glue for a week you guys requested
this on Twitter and I feel like you did
that because you were like Laura crazy
nugget we want to see you jack up your
face in your eyelash the glitter the
glue isn't sticking really well to the
glitter oh that does not look good girl
this is how it in 2016
really hard to get a wash to stick to
this much glitter go lashes look a
little janky did I just complete the
glitter challenge I think so I mean I
probably need a little more is to really
bog my shower drain
