have to do it again her eye
lorilee larlie hello guys I have a
switch of scenery I have run over to
this little lady's house and this is
Kristin Dominique hey we're so weird
even the highlighter challenge we are so
excited this video has been floating all
around YouTube's interweb and it's just
taking over glazed donuts every which
way
we've got to light it up okay okay okay
okay Kristin has done her challenge and
as you saw this is not my challenge I
was wearing over here to film the intro
you should have got a Christmas channel
and check out her highlighter challenge
if you want to like a golden glazed
doughnut mine looks more like a Tin Man
I would say it does so it's actually
completely different how they turned out
let's agree this is a great look for
school work everyday makeup just like a
5 minute makeup challenge this is it no
mirror makeup challenge this is it I'm
still be sure and watch her video I'll
have it linked down below and subscribe
grab before you late subscribe before
you leave we don't work we miss now a
lot of fun on a crazy there's a lot of
nine things happening on this channel
you should know what eyes are you
subscribed I'm I'm possibly subscribe
you possibly if she's not there's a lot
of guys channel I will flip a table if
you're not subscribe
I've been subscribed to you since from a
long long time he is a proud fan and
supporter of this Laura Lee channel so
guys we're gonna pray in the video when
Kristen gets finished digging lipstick
out of our teeth for starters I'm going
to go in with my Smashbox primer water
just to prime my skin feel like
everything on like a hydrated
moisturized skin is gonna like stick
better like the highlight would stick
better I don't know that's just my game
plan and using this you'd be using the
new champagne pop shimmering skin
perfecter liquid kind of as my
foundation
come on go come on little guy I think
I'm gonna put a lot of it cuz I'm pretty
sure this is like a sheer liquid
highlight and we're trying to get loud
up in here
my V yeah this is like super sheer so
really this is just gonna help I'm about
to look crazy oh it smells so good
oh wait no it's my Beauty Blender this
smells good I wonder if this is gonna
come off easy I think what any normal
person doing their makeup would do next
is set their foundation especially if
it's this liquidy I'm gonna be using
Illuminati this is a diamond glow powder
from the artist couture line and they
are so pigmented I couldn't think of it
like a better thing to use look at that
ah come through like come through
I look so good like I look so good
getting a smaller more detailed brush to
get around the edges
Oh Manish look at the eyebrow it will
never be the same
great literally I didn't even know how
to sit there or there but like highlight
brings out so much texture in the skin
any little flaw I have is now
intensified can you like see my
highlight can't can't see it
do I need to get more more I'm going to
be going in with this cream highlight
this is Golden Age from Mac I'm actually
going to use my nose contour brush this
is an 870 eye shadow brush from Sigma
and I'm going to contour my nose because
it's a bronze color I'm going to go in
with my pure sunkissed glow palette this
just sounds like a bunch of pretty
highlight colors in it and I'm going to
start off with the darkest and that same
brush I'm going to do my eyes I'm going
to take this cream color and like buff
it in the outer corner and work it on up
into the crease now I'll take a little
bit of the lighter shade and pack it on
to the lid and then we're going to set
it with a little bit of a powder
highlight I literally look so good for
my powder highlight show I'm going up
this little violet Voss trio
it's a highlighting palette and I'm
going to take moon gleen which is the
lightest shade
it's actually a beautiful eyeshadow just
pushing this right onto the lid this
flat be 58 brush from Sigma I'm actually
going to go ahead and do that the brow
bone with a little bit of moon bling it
looks pretty good I'm going to take a
bit of star glow which is the medium
color in the palette and just blend that
right in that outer corner I'm going to
take a blush topper highlight this is
Broadway from the artist Couture diamond
glow collection so pretty I'm going to
apply this on as my blush needless to
say I'll be washing all of my brushes
after this because if I touch my face
with them again I might be a little
shimmery I'm gonna take this morphe 4
brush and this is the betty loumanizer
Mayon Iser betty loumanizer
and it's like a bronze highlight color I
don't think this quite counts as a
bronzer so this is like the only thing I
know to use hey yes contour yeah I like
a frosted wedding cake
and I'm not mad about it I'm gonna go in
and add just like a little bit of a
winged liner because I'm gonna add false
lashes and my ban on the lashes is kind
of thick so if I don't do this you'll be
able to see my skin actually I'm not
gonna wing it out I'm not gonna wing it
out
and I'm gonna be adding some mascara
this one's by Lancome let's get a really
weird one I'm going to take these little
lashes in NYC they all quite lovely a
day Simon tell me to I mean if I
had lashes that were made of a highlight
I'll probably be wearing I'm know I
would be I would wear them look I'm a
little Lily lash coming through
yes I'm gonna do my lips now first I'm
going to apply a little bit of this
bronze shade from Mac as like my bronze
lipstick it's actually like really nice
and soft next I'm going to take skinny
dip buys you a this is like it's
literally a liquid highlight for your
lips essentially and you know what I
really I just want to go hard and I'm
gonna fly a little bit of gold digger
artists Couture right on top clearly the
most important part of this whole
process is my highlight which I mean you
can't really see yet I know it's a
little dull but there it is there it is
now you can see I'm going to add a
little bit of nude to my waterline just
to open it up and now I'm gonna melt
like everything into my skin using a
little bit of my mac fix+ spray and this
is it so this is basically my everyday
makeup tutorial from now on I kind of
love it okay I really love it I love
