community section like what challenged
me to you want me to see and like the
top one what's between web makeup
brushes and kids makeup so kids makeup
it is
I literally have quite a few different
sets of kids makeup what the hell and oh
my god secret compartment just shot out
I even know this was there I'm really
excited to be filming this video I
really want to try really hard to do a
good makeup look with the video the only
thing I don't have it's like a kid's
mascara or lashes but I mean I think
happily literally everything else even
concealer yeah I bought mrs. makeup off
Amazon just a little tea the reason I'm
so late I'm filming this video I mean I
could have summed it before definitely
kiddie owes this challenge just like a
year old and I'm just now getting do it
and everyone on the internet did this
challenge but me um it's because I try
to do this challenge when it was popular
out or does it makeup off Amazon and
whenever I start having the video all
the makeup I order was pretend kids
makeup so the makeup wasn't even real
that's how fake it was and I was like
now I am actually gonna be filming it
and I made sure the make it was real so
yeah that's what we're gonna be doing
today and I'm really excited about it I
think this could be interesting you know
and I'm not trying to sell you on any
kids makeup here don't try this at home
anyways without further ado we're gonna
sing the SUBSCRIBE song and then we're
gonna jump right into the video so let's
go ahead and sing along hi sure and
subscribe to my channel
yeah link now let's go ahead and jump
right into the video
some of this stuff together on camera to
see what all we actually got to work
with oh this just fell right out I did
peek at it in order to make sure it was
real didn't get played again my Amazon
all right
opening her up we have oh my gosh look
at all the stuff we have we have
concealer brow wax body glitter Wow
lipsticks blushes girly about the gets
heart so got this little makeup set it
says do you want to be trendy on there
kind of creepy and we a blush and
glitter and then whenever I was talking
to you guys earlier a secret compartment
shut out that I didn't know anything
about there she is oh baby there's
another secret compartment huh net and
then I don't know if you even have to
use this but I have it on standby in
case we have to grab for it you know
that is what we're gonna do so let's get
started and apparently I'm gonna have to
use the concealer that's my foundation
because I can find any foundation Vava
just take this out because it's just
gonna be easier right this makeup look
might take me a little while to do I so
don't have any face primer for this okay
you know kids don't wear face primer so
I don't wear face primer well this is
gonna be bad just dug my finger in it
and like nothing but like grease and a
little bit of color came off so okay
let's uh let's do this oh my gosh
nothing's coming off hello already off
to a bad start
it's gonna be a little bit more
challenging than I thought that's okay
literally just dug a hunk of it out yeah
that's better
okay we got a little something yeah cuz
I mean you gotta have some makeup on so
yeah there we go you just gotta like get
in there you know oh yeah we got color
we got slight coverage can't wait for my
face to fully break out after I do this
but you know it's all for YouTube it's
all for you guys just a day in the life
I mean I'm not gonna say we got great
coverage or anything here but we got
something we got foundation on and
that's what counts it feels heavy and
sticky that's great okay moving on I'm
excited where we're going it to apply
dig out a little bit of both of these
and mix them for concealer I'm just
gonna take out our teeth brush to pull
this out this so oh yeah that's thick we
didn't cover that
okay well that concealer actually
provided highlighting and coverage so
I'm shook it go get your kids makeup
today it appears that I don't have any
powder that is a skin like not even an
eyeshadow I feel like the makeups so
good oh god it's crazy I feel like the
makeup is so great that you really don't
even need to set it so here we have brow
products I think this is a brow wax and
then these oops our brow colors I'm
actually gonna go in with this shade
here
I mean it's a thick brow but it's not
like the worse and we're gonna carve it
out and clean it up a little bit so the
brow looks pretty good it's pretty good
I actually ended up mixing the darkest
color because this turn a light
transparent but the darkest color with
the wax and I just like made my brow
pomade and I'm just gonna dip into this
shade and carve out these barrels got
excited like this is a real challenge
what's making it a challenge I feel like
it's me actually trying to like do a
good look with it hey my brows look
really good you have quite the selection
of eyeshadow so I wanted to do a really
colorful look there's like 19 pinks in
this thing you see there's like the same
color pink it's a ripoff guys is a
ripoff okay I'm gonna dip into one of
the three yellows they're all pretty
much the same she's not gonna give this
a good review you know they're gonna put
the same color in the palette how can I
give it a good review I mean let me just
say this
the yellow eyeshadow is pigmented okay
I'm dipped in other yellow eyeshadows
from other brands they don't have this
much pigment so I'm a little shook it
I'm like okay what lab are we use it on
all serious note is very pigmented so
that's something to think about you know
this kid makeup is really coming for
these makeup brands out here and dip
into this lovely oh my god now girl that
orange color is so honey what the
pigment
I'm sure why does it have so much good
pigment
well how is it actually a pretty color
mixed together this pretty shimmer harp
hold is actually like really pretty and
then this neon purple don't blend that
in that outer corner and if you notice
every time I put on a color I try to
keep it a little bit lower I know this
isn't a makeup tutorial tutorial so I'm
not trying to be too explanatory because
you guys aren't at home with your
children's makeup playing along or are
you did you steal your little girl
makeup that would be funny I'm just kind
of doing it and we're gonna see like
what immaculate look I can create with
this snow ain't mad at the makeup okay
the purple doesn't have much pigment
it's more of a pink but I'm okay with
that because I'm so impressed with their
colors how could I be mad and I'm gonna
take the neon pink I'm just gonna work
that on the outer corner and kind of
bring it in a little bit went back to
our concealer right here oh yeah I am
I'm gonna like try to add some glitter
we're really doing this guys I told you
it's not joke to me
have the second palette here that I
showed you guys and I really want to add
some of this pretty pink light pink
purple glitter I mean I'm just gonna add
with my finger so if you guys don't know
I hate these things like I hate them and
I don't think make a brand should be
putting them in the packaging cuz
they're for little kids in this case of
course they should but I'm gonna use it
today even though I hate it does it pain
me to use it yeah you know it does but
it's all for YouTube and it's actually
working way better than my finger and I
actually need this at this moment never
did I see this day coming but yeah so
what it looks like these are these
glitters so it's just like clear
vaseline or grease with a little bit of
glitter sprinkled on top of the grease
that's okay I mean this is not that bad
does that have any eyeliner I'm just
gonna take the black shade and kind of
line my lashline a little bit so that
way whenever I put on some mascara
lashes it looks decent why is this black
eyeshadow so pigmented I will tell you I
have like the grease on it what have the
grease on my eye from the glitter like
that Vaseline agree stuff so it's making
the black like super intense on top of
it all right I'm gonna add on a little
bit of mascara since I don't have a
little kid mascara I'm sure that would
be I guess kind of dangerous it's not a
mom I do have a lot of nieces though and
I would probably give him a mascara of
the asshole I'm during Christmas time my
niece that is three I was putting on my
makeup for Christmas morning and she
came in the room was sitting by me and
then she wanted makeup so I would just
like take the makeup brush with nothing
on it and put it on her cheek and she'd
be like
yes it was so cute though it was just a
moment you know just put on some lashes
in Lila these are really pretty lashes
but let me just update you on what's
happening the grease from the glitter is
creasing and it's also making the lash
glue not stick well now I'm going to add
some a little bit of makeup on the under
eye area I'm gonna go in with our orange
shade and then go to the pink and purple
shade as well I'm just using a 36 oh
shoot we do have major creasing right
there well let's just look past it
pretending it's not good take some in
that black shade I'm just gonna add it
really close to the lash line and now
I'm gonna add some mascara to those
lower lashes I'm using the lash
sensational in case anyone's wondering -
hi like I paid on my face I'm gonna try
this why oh yeah this is like a shimmery
white shade a little bit too white but
we're gonna highlight with it anyways a
little highlight not bad oh like my
eyeshadow is kind of morphing all into
one I'm gonna add this pink shade I put
a little bit of blush
I don't have a bronzer and I don't have
yeah I don't have a brown eyeshadow I'll
use a little bit of eyebrow product just
for shits and giggles you know oh I have
four Gretz right now because I didn't
set the makeup and it was super greasy
so it's just sticking I have a forward
grandmother right now forehead is shiny
actually got a little kitty lip liner so
Alice sharp this lash oh oh it won't
stay okay so I'm gonna put on the
lipstick the little kid lipstick that
goes with it this is my final look guys
what do you think I mean it's not that
bad it could be worse I clearly did this
with kids makeup
besides the lashes I think I look pretty
good I'm impressed
okay I just want to say that I like the
makeup look and do I plan on wearing it
out maybe I'm just kidding no it looks
good and this makeup was cheap AF as
well on Amazon so what do you guys think
