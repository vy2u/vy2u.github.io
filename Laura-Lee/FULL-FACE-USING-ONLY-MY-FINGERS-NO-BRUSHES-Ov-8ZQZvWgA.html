pictures hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be me doing a
full face of makeup with only my fingers
I don't know how this is going to turn
out so I figured it would be best to do
my intro with no makeup on in case this
is a total fail and then my intro I look
wonky and crazy I always look walking
crazy I saw in the key tutorials do this
video and I was really inspired as to
list you know please don't focus on my
finger nails because they are a hot mess
I have just got back from Belize and
Paris like I was on a plane for 15 hours
yesterday I haven't had time to do
anything with my nails and I haven't sat
down and filmed a video in a long long
time so I just really wanted to get back
in here and start filming some videos
for you guys
even with my nails busted watch how do
you do your eyebrows also if you haven't
subscribed to my channel be sure and
subscribe today we're gonna jump right
in and get started let's do it I want to
start off with my Too Faced hangover RX
facial primer this one will be an easy
one to use the fingers for this is just
a hydrating primer oh I just like that I
didn't cut my hair by the way in a
ponytail oh my gosh a choker disappeared
I'm going to go ahead and do my
foundation with my hands which kicks it
back to my high school days when I used
to always do my foundation with my hands
so I'm going to be using the nude sister
your skin foundation I'm in shade zero
three zero just kind of it feels weird
doing this with my hands and I probably
need to get some makeup wipe so I can
wipe off my hands whenever I get done
with each step I wonder if I can slay my
eyebrows with my hands that parts got me
shook because color is too light for me
and I am now realizing that I mean it
kind of looks good but like my shoulder
is a different color I'm going to take a
little bit this hourglass um
stick foundation and just dab it out try
to like you must get some color and a
little bit of extra coverage this one is
not as easy to blend out with your
fingers I'm learning
that very quickly I'm now going to take
my genki genki fingernail and apply some
brow pomade this one's - aw it's
their deep brown and medium brown now
lately I've been using my fat brow
pencil but that's not really an option
for me right now I don't know how I'm
gonna do this I think I'm gonna try to
get it on my fingernail and like use my
fingernail as a tool use my janky giant
fingernail as a tool it's already under
my fingernail so so crap
Oh see actual under the fingernail
method if you can see it's pretty much
working I mean it's starting to come
together oh my gosh my brow kind of
looks like it's gonna look good guys
looks like I've been digging in a you
know what this one turned out pretty
much just as wonky as this one we're
gonna do some Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre and try to carve these little bad
boys out first I'm gonna start by
dabbing it on my eyelid for my primer I
mean I guess is better I need to fill in
a little more right there alright so my
eyebrows right now they're pretty
they're not the worst but they're thick
and they're uneven so we're just gonna
keep going I'm going to take this
palette from Tarte it's called style by
faroush and I'm going to grab the color
vamp which is a cold tone great
transition shade I'm going oh my gosh
okay
I don't know guys it's not the end of
the world because my finger is my finger
not brush it's like getting all down on
my eyelid ah it's not that bad I take a
little bit of pinch and just apply it
kind of like right on in there I don't
really know exactly where I'm applying
it because this is this is hard I'm just
rubbing it in my eye I want to take a
little bit of kitty but I'm really
scared to so I'm just gonna use my pinky
to do so cuz it's darker and trying to
like darken it up
I'm gonna take some my violet Voss
glitter glue which is some of the best
glitter glue in the world I want to do
some glitter guys which may not be the
best idea but I got some on my finger
I'm just gonna dab the glitter glue
around uhm glitter glue I have these
glitter injection like eyeshadows I
think I want to use this confetti one
it's like multiple different colors are
full pinky but very silver at the same
time I mean that's pretty I mean I kind
of got it everywhere but we can fix that
I'm hard to get that inner corner
without getting it absolutely everywhere
like look at my bottom line now next I'm
going to take a little bit of smitten
just on the tip of my finger and just
highlight the brow bone although I'm
getting it all the way down kind of low
by accident I'm now gonna take a makeup
wipe and try to get the glitter out of
my inner corner ochre this is where the
video gets crazy because I'm about to
apply mascara with my hand I don't know
how to do this I don't know I'm just
gonna pinch my lashes you know I'm going
to add false lashes and then you just
blink onto your thumb
next I'm going to be applying drunk in
love lashes by icon lashes
icon lashes icon lashes now we're going
to move on to the face I'm going to use
the shape tape concealer by Tarte this
one is in light/medium and it's one of
my favorite conceals
this part is going to be easy I've done
my concealer with my fingers many times
and watch it turn out like a train wreck
I'm sure you guys notice I skipped out
on eyeliner and yeah I think I've
benefited myself to the max by doing
that because I have no idea like there's
just no I just I wouldn't be able to
work that out to set my concealer I've
been using this bus a bus a Samba saw me
saying the same EECOM setting powder and
I lost the filter to it or the sifter so
now it just kind of blows out everywhere
I'm gonna bake this little cake of a
face so I love trying to do powders cake
underneath my fingernail and it's not
they give me a like freak out a tag like
I can't stand the feeling I didn't
really think about the part of dusting
it away that's probably not going to be
easy
so I've concluded that a cream contour
would be easier than a powder contour
I'm going to be using this cameo contour
by pure and shade light and I'm going to
apply it my finder come on canto there's
trash that place
so it's looking a little bit patchy
through here luckily this is not a very
deep contour color so that helps the
situation but this is I'm promise you
guys this part is way harder than it
looks
my face is like yeah click rubbing need
to add a little bit of Laura Mercier
this is their bronze Oh to powder just
stopping it up oh I think I just made it
worse Oh huh I'm going to use the rocket
or blush from benefit I find it the
shimmery products are way easier to
blend out on the skin then the matte
products especially your fingers so this
feels so we're just like digging in my
blush like next I'm going to take my
current favorite highlight which is
joues topaz I know they just launched
these and they are they're so good guys
let's say give me a 15% off discount
code which is Laura 15 off so you don't
have to pay full price for them I mean
so I've been avoiding my under-eye area
because I don't know how this is gonna
the hair there is a hair in my palate
you know I don't know how this is gonna
play out exactly I'm gonna try to get
like a smidge a pinch at the tip of my
finger and just blend it I just mix the
three Brown shades together and I'm just
blending them I'm just hoping for good
things people gonna go in with my March
a kiss velvet and you would must get up
I'm gonna get some on the tip of this
finger and the tip of my thumb together
and I'm gonna pinch the lashes
now I'm going to take value from issue a
this is one of their new fall colors and
it gets some oh my fine go
all right so I did it I did this full
face to make it with my fingers only I
mean I know the eyes are not like some
dramatic there's lipstick on my teeth no
the eyes are not like a dramatic smoky
eye but I feel like I did the most
dramatic I could with what I had I love
the way the lips came out although my
lips my eyebrows are what took me the
longest for sure I literally sat here
and meticulously like it took me a
really long time I would not recommend
doing this on the daily I recommend
buying makeup brushes like for the most
part I won at this challenge like it's
like it's wearable I hope you guys
