today's video is going to be me using my
mom's makeup ooh girl she got an
extension clip just loose fluffing
around back there I'm gonna be using my
mom's makeup for a full face tutorial so
my mom came to visit me and she left me
her makeup bag so I'd be able to film
this video so she's like girl can you
film the video and send it back all of
her makeup that she uses on the regular
is in here and I'm gonna use it for a
full face makeup I'm like mom what are
you been using so she definitely has her
favorites it was like it cosmetic lorac
and shuwei are her favorite brands but
I'm excited to do the video and see what
my mom she poo has been up to with her
makeup bag so I said my mom PR I think
if there's pure I'm not gonna be using I
show her things and ask does she want it
and she takes a lot of it so she's a lot
of these products I have sent her and
she's like picked her favorite saw and
uses them see that's all I got for you
guys I wanted a magical announcement in
the intro but I ain't gosh hey so I
guess we'll just jump right into the
video and get started first you to thing
this is
alright now let's go ahead and jump
right into the video
this is it honey ain't a lot in there
yeah first of all the makeup bag is full
of baby powder mom I'm gonna wash these
brushes for and then we're gonna send
them back but first they're gonna get a
good washing
ok first she has this tarte maracuja
vitamin C eye brightener and she's used
a lot of it so we can definitely tell
that like this is her jam so you know
I'm gonna start by putting a little bit
on and we're just gonna do the mom she
posed routine next she doesn't use a
facial primer because she didn't pop one
that's this it cosmetics oh she loves it
honey this is the confidence and the
compacts in medium tan she also has this
a cosmetic CC cream so I think I'm gonna
use a little bit of both mom has always
since I've been little used compact
makeup like this she used to always buy
the covergirl kind this is the world's
first solid serum foundation I remember
reviewing this it's really awesome
anywho she used to always buy the
covergirl kind in the blue container and
I remember growing up if I had like
picture day or something exciting like
homecoming and junior high like she let
me go use her expensive covergirl makeup
and I would always go in there and dab
some on my face even though I'm 90% sure
it wasn't my color at all like mine the
little memories with makeup you build
and have you never know what your kid if
you have a kid or if you're planning on
having kids you never know like the
little things that they'll remember so
you know I just know she's a compact
makeup girl and always will be she keeps
her little sponges mom is one of those
people who like if I showed a brush or a
sponge or whatever she always keeps it
in the compact so we're gonna make sure
not lose that now I'm gonna put on some
of this CC cream just a little bit the
coverage is nice I haven't used that in
a minute but girl I'm here for it I want
to put some of this on my morphe sponge
and tap it out for a little bit of extra
coverage thank God her color and my
color is similar okie dokie artichokie
next for concealer
has the Mac Pro Longwear yes mama bird
my nails have to go get them done
tomorrow so they're just gonna look like
shite so I'm gonna put some on my sponge
this is just a tried-and-true concealer
I literally this is the concealer I wore
all through high school if I did wear
concealer that is like I didn't wear
much honey that's just a good concealer
you just can't go wrong with it so the
shade she has is NC 30 which is my shade
hallelujah now she does not have a
setting powder in here which I'm like
okay yes to brow products for the eye
brows first she has the bombs for
ferocious this is a brow pencil in the
shade of blonde and then she is a blonde
oh Lord
oh we might have to use a little bit of
a dark brown out of this palette from
g'way mom you have baby powder all over
your makeup it looks like she likes this
palette first time I try to use this
brow pencil you like this shade is not
even remotely showing up on me okay so I
think I'm gonna have to go in with just
her eye shadow
so the brow color is not what I
typically would go for but girl I don't
think it looks that bad we're gonna move
on to eyeshadow as you guys to see this
palette is the essential matte and
shimmery eyeshadow palette this is a
very simple neutral I should have
palette so I think we should create an
all matte eyeshadow look since I pretty
much never do that I always like to
start my looks out with the m57 three
brush so I'm just gonna tap into to this
shade right here can you guys see it
it's like a super neutral bone shade I
like forgot how much I loved that Mac
concealer and then it's like got me back
into it I'm like okay I'm sorry using
that more color
I'll go in with the transition this
little tan shade right here and just
blend oh come on
pigment blend that out I'm using the
exact same brush and I'm also gonna
blend it like all over the outer corner
as well didn't really plan to do that
but it relates how much like pigment or
forgot much pigment this palette has in
it which is amazing sorry the volume
ever goes down when I'm speaking I
haven't got a mic right here and I
always forget that I'm you know hello
talking to the camera I feel like I'm
talking to you in person so I hold the
palette up in front of my mouth to see
in the mirror and I always forget a box
the mic until I'm editing and then I get
so pissed at myself I'm like Laura it's
gonna keep on building up that same
brown color if you notice the more you
build it up a little bit darker it gets
which looks very pretty so today I'm
filming this video and it is the 26th
that is the day of March and today on
the 26th of March in 2013 yep that's
right in 2013 it uploaded my first
youtube video Wow
like that it's just like alright am I
going with this color next r39 it's a
little bit smaller of a blender really
great for medium eyelids or if you just
want to be a little more precise with
your blend it's so crazy the journey
that YouTube has took me on
and YouTube has been a lot of hard work
but it's been a lot of passionate work
like everything I do for YouTube is a
lot of work but it's hard to view it as
it is work innocence you know but it's
hard to exactly view it as just work I'm
gonna mix in some of this red-brown this
is such an amazing journey and it's
creating your own content you know
without anyone breathing down your neck
huffing and puffing which we've all had
the jobs where the bosses do that and
just being your own boss like there's
nothing like it and having that creative
freedom so like I said it is work but
it's also like a dream come true so when
I tap into this matte shade and we're
gonna apply this to the eyelid okay I
really like the way that I look came out
like I said how did you just mat sit on
the ball time and I think it turned out
but our liner my mom has loved this
liner forever this is the Tarte so fine
liner and she's always wore a black lip
liner like out of the womb she had it on
honey
all right mom CP this one is about dry
down I am struggling so hard right now
okay I feel like my wing liner is
turning out like a garbage can because
this is so dried oh my mom doesn't do
wing liner she just she just lines her
eyelid for mascara my mom has this
double-ended lorac mascara pretty good
mascara come on see you I see you
bronzer she has this confidence in a
compact kit and it was blush highlighter
and bronzer but the only thing that's
confusing me in the hell is it all
bronzer now like this was all
highlighter this was blush and this was
bronzer but like underneath the first
layer a couple layers it looks like it
turns to all bronzer did you guys know
that I had no idea that was happening
it's a really pretty bronzer shade also
my face isn't set so the effort got and
like the powder is sticking to the web
makeup hmm for highlighter my mom has
this little as you a highlighter called
rose gold is a bomb highlighter also a
code was you a 15% off if you guys
didn't know I'm a damn plan to promote
it in this video but you know since
mom's using at all its Laura Lee good
God Almighty
I forgot how pretty this highlighter was
so I went ahead and applied Miami by
Lily lashes my mom's obsessed with those
so she just had these lying around her
makeup bag okay she didn't but we can
pretend that she did look at the
lipstick shades mom packed you ready to
see him I wonder what color she likes to
wear a lot that's a Power Move mom she's
rushing red chilly and Ruby woo she is
the three Mac classics in here so I'm
going Ruby woo you know mom took it
there so we got to we got to take it to
you know what's crazy about this makeup
look is it actually looks like my mom's
makeup she likes a natural eye and a red
lip she will wear a red lip every single
day of her life
clearly I saw three MAC lipsticks
rolling around in here and I was like oh
well Mama's wearing my back and know I'm
high girl already knew anyways I really
love the makeup looks I love the way it
came
oh I mean that highlight J does my mom
slays okay I just wish there was a
setting powder so I'm just gonna sue she
forgot to put that in there but other
than that that is it for this video guys
that looked her I mean this is slay H
right here so the lashes is the only
part I cheated on oh my god I forgot to
do my lash line all right add a little
something to the bottom lash line rather
than that that's it for this video thank
