have pallet so my biggest rolling on
trial I agree you are I have an
advantage because like I I don't even
know how to do eyeshadow you're gonna
struggle a little bit so I gave us each
one like big morphe palette with like
neutrals and shimmers because I think

challenge has been going around so I
thought it'd be cute yeah I'm excited

fuck ya week okay we did sound good
already so I think we should do like a
medium brush to like buff like the
powder all over for fun okay let's do
action - I'm hoping this color
foundation I'm thinking like this for me
that's clearly not my shade but it's the
closest this one's gonna be yellow yeah
give me a little tan ish vibe I didn't
put on myself down under there let me
tell you oh how did you get so much
product I'm like feel like I have to
like hold it together and then I jam it
in there it just looks like I have a
kind of a rash coming on now you stuck
your visited cheeto bag its bags girl
you're looking kind of good I feel dry
oh yeah I do really dry especially like
right here I might yeah no right here
definitely these two shades I think I
got like a good contour color yeah I'm
pretty sure one of those is like this
shade it like hoola by benefit like that
it's a kazoo music it's like the exact
same color oh you're about to be asked
you just actually put a lot on I
literally like a person that was in the
tanning bed for way too long or you use
this too much self-tanner
thank you I actually like I got these
nails done and I was like it made me
like like my skin yeah it looks really
good
but I do like summertime when I'm like
tan oh yes I mean I love using a little
bit of a self-tanner no I think when you
turn your faces I just lie that you like
a pure orange stripe like don't look at
my neck maybe I should zip this up I'm
gonna use this like way too shimmery
shade that I should have used for my
blush I also don't usually use blush
because I feel like my cheeks always get
Rosie I so many people that I know
Aurelia's blush now yeah you do have
rosy cheeks I think it's just when I get
nervous
I just got punched in the face I feel
like that's like how people do their
makeup like way back when it is I think
I looked at old pictures I would look
like that yeah and now I feel like we
all figured out makeup and the tricks of
the trade so no one does isn't it's like
old Kim Kardashian yes yes yeah this is
old Kim K like super bronze the intense
blood concealer where are we going with
this I don't even know how we can
possibly do concealer sweetie MUA Hey
okay so I said makeup makeup artist yeah
bye
in like bright shade is this guy it's
actually gonna be like a super pretty
like highlighter oh that is so pretty
here is eyeshadows for highlighters all
the time really mm-hmm
I'm so out of it I really do how you
doing this looks bad
oh god I still look bad they're not like
lighter but I feel like I they don't
leave oh and your blush looks really
good don't use this brush yep I also
feel like I'm really bad with
highlighters I don't know it was just
like how I apply them we've consulted I
should mix these you have is this one
yeah for sure that's actually a nice
broker like how we only get to use
powder I like like what are you use
typically for your eyebrows I have the
Anastacio brow pencil nice like the thin
one brow is and then sometimes I use
like I had the angled brush that they
have and I use it with the little pomade
oh the brow powder but I feel like I
don't always love my eyebrows I um I
used like I definitely love the on
associate brow Wiz I also use the
benefit precisely like it's like the
same thing essentially but it's um
benefits like a brow pencil I feel like
like taking a test pretty good I'm not
ingrained to you and I think you're
doing awesome I always raise my eyebrow
and it just makes everyone thinks that I
have like a high bro but I was raised
this voice is like hey brows looks so
good first of all this one does not
swing I think it's gonna be good
what do we do next I say we do eyeshadow
okay what if we add our eyeshadow with I
don't do eyeshadow like when I say I
don't do eyeshadow like I don't do
eyeshadow
I'm going into a trance these will paint
your fingers so hard because they slam
closed and my fingers always get stuck
my way summer happened to me I'm like
trying to pinch myself yeah I'm using my
foundation shade by the way I've seen
people like tap it oh yeah girl get the
tab knock off that excess shadow do you
know I do instead of like putting on
mascara I like put water through them
like powder yeah powder so that's smart
they're not blacker than they were but
they you know are like clearly dark that
way back there my eyeshadow doesn't look
bad that's cuz I have one color eyes
it's all about it oh I don't know where
to go I like nervous I'm like stuck I
feel like okay so you have your brown
mat down right okay so I feel like maybe
like even with your fingers so I put on
my whole lid I don't even know where am
I going with it it looks good it looks
good how you have it I really like it we
could show um pick a shimmer you like
and like maybe like just lightly press
it off with your finger I watch a decent
amount of viewed at your wrist now and
I'm like oh god I just packed it on I
don't know the right thing to do you it
looks good you need she's lying to me
yeah this is lying I'm cheating yes hey
anymore oh wow yeah nobody follow my
makeup routine cuz it's just cringy I
should do a video following no really I
[Laughter]
like it it's pretty right nice okay what
color are you doing like the way it
feels though like even more yeah I love
that stuff they're gonna do something
like just not too crazy I don't know
just like skin color no it's really
pretty I mean I don't hate it I don't
love it
I just like how it looks with the gloss
like just looking actually looks like it
turned into like literally looks like a
glowy downward I think so we're good
besides my face I like your lip it's a
little it looks like a glove if you only
had a palate you could definitely work
it I would just skip the foundation yeah
but you it actually worked
depending on your skin tone yeah I might
work a little bit give us a a B C or D
