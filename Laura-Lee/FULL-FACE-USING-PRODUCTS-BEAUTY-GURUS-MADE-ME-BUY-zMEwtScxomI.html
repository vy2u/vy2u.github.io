welcome to my channel I'm laughing
because look at the third time I've done
this intro because I keep messing up
today's video is going to be talking
about our beloved beauty community and
talking about the products that beauty
gurus have made me by they have the same
effect on me as they have on you i watch
the tutorials and then i'm like okay
well then I need all the products they
dish use so basically a couple these
products were sent to me and PR but they
are the beauty community is the reason
that I use them because of how good they
look on their skin so I'm gonna be
talking about different products that
people in the beauty community made me
fall in love with so that is today's
video guys I hope you're excited for it
cuz I'm excited to film it so we're
gonna be doing a look with all the
products now explain who made me buy or
who made me start using each product I'm
so excited to be back filming I've been
out of town I went to New Orleans for
the sugar ball roll tide and for New
Year's Eve and I met so many of you guys
you guys are awesome thank you for
coming out to me hugs and pictures I
love you guys so much and I think that
is all the story times I have to tell
you oh my god okay I guess we can get
started filming and I'll stop rambling
so without further ado we're gonna sing
the SUBSCRIBE song and then we're gonna
jump right into subscribe my channel
yeah
and now let's go ahead and jump right
into the video
the first I'll start out with primer and
for primer carli bybel has got me stuck
on this one this is the Becca velvet
burglaring primer I really like this
product I think it does an excellent job
of blurring out imperfections and
smoothing out pores so I saw Carly used
to someone of her tutorials and I really
stopped to like it and I just forgot to
shake it up because you gotta give it a
good shake for foundation Jacqueline
Hill you were 100% responsible for the
reason I use this foundation this is the
doer forever foundation she swears by
this product there is another Dior
foundation that I love so much and I
didn't want to quit using it and try out
another one I just wanted to be stuck to
my old ways and be happy
it looks so good our skin so I was like
okay let me try it out and guess what I
love it it's a really really great
foundation it looks so beautiful on the
skin I'm using shade zero three zero and
oh my gosh and it also blends out so
good it's just good the goodness so I'm
gonna blend that out with my Wyatt 6
from morphe this is my favorite film ooh
found braces it's my favorite foundation
brush look how pretty this foundation is
I also love this shade it's a great
shade next up for concealer it's the
Tarte shaped tape and there is a beauty
well there's a lot of beauty bloggers
they use this but Jim Charles uses this
no matter what and he's got me hooked on
it if I'm not using this I'm using my
NARS creamy radiant which was Nicole
Guerrero so many years ago started using
that and I got hooked on it from her
even use the same shade but this I think
James is responsible for James II Wayne
Z I see you boy and this sponge I'm
gonna be blending it out with today is
another Jacqueline Hill recommendation
this is some morphe sponge and it's hard
for me to change out my sponges and like
believe it another sponge after the
Beauty Blender but this one works really
well it's wet so it's like huge if you
can see up next to my face
but it it gets really soft and it has
like this very slight denseness to which
I think it helps it not eggs orb absorb
you guys know I make up words right as
much product if it really good sponge
and I also like this in to carve out so
this is a multi you sponge and I think
it's great and it's way cheaper than the
Beauty Blender as well I just blended it
out flawlessly okay for setting powder
honestly I did have like a youtuber
recommendation I feel like we all use
the same stuff so I'm gonna be using the
co effects perfecting setting powder
which is something I swear by um so much
this is what it looks like without the
lid but this is a really great one I use
translucent light this is good stuff
people and I like to take a white
actually I'm gonna use the sponge today
because we talked about our YouTube
family here okay so I'm just gonna press
this on with this poncho and we bake it
365 degrees I just put it all over my
face okay
I make it ain't going nowhere today
nowhere X we're gonna dive in it to
bronze darling are really just
contouring my face so I'm gonna be using
the Smashbox this is a little contour
palette I had this product for a long
time and I saw Casey homes using it and
it just blend it out and looks so pretty
on her face and I'm like why am I not
using this Smashbox makes great products
so I'm gonna use this to bronze and I
really love this
you should glue one by the way they're
using the M 105 a brush to contour with
this brush is really nice I like it
because it is a little bit raspy and it
has it's kind of flattened so it fits
perfectly your cheek bone the contour it
out it's a really good brush and it's
also an extremely affordable brush on
more fees website like this is not part
of their elite collection so the
bristles are a little bit more raspy but
I do let it honey
it sometimes I feel like if I pull my
hair I can just snatch my face more
maybe maybe not so I always hit the jaw
line as well but I'm careful not to do
too much because girl I could make you
like he got a pop o'clock shadow and
said it's not the look I'm going for
okay yeah so when I was out in Louisiana
in New Orleans which it by the way I
forgot how much I loved that wasn't the
first time I've been there but I hadn't
been there in like five or six years and
Islands it's like one of my favorite
cities so what's on my New Orleans
people I am not used to really cold
weather clearly I live in California so
I'm kind of spoiled with the weather and
whenever I got out there I was like
freezing that's a really bad
interpretation of what it looks like to
be freezing but I was freezing that's
why I was trying to tell you there I
made it you know I made it out alive and
I shouldn't say this because I'm gonna
jinx myself but I never get sick and
when I was out there in the cold I was
like I guess what I came back just fine
but at one point I was like walking
through the cold and the wind was
blowing so hard in my face and I was
kept trying to wrap my scarf or my mouth
but my lips they're like froze I
couldn't feel my mouth okay okay so I'm
just gonna dust this away and only add
powder with the e49 brush but today
we're dusting it away with the e29 brush
cuz we get in crazy for blood Michael
Finch got me using this blush from
benefit not the whole palette but the
California or Gala for Nia blush
especially I didn't learn about this
product on the benefit trip but after
seeing it on his beautiful face I fell
in love with it so it's kind of like my
thing now also I just in general love
benefit blushes oh this peachy color
it's just right up my alley
oh but if it makes a good blush honey
blush is done we're gonna move onward oh
my gosh hello
I caught it London these illuminator
drops Holly Boone says he's on her face
and she's turns into a radiant angel and
then I put them on my face and I turn
from a potato to a sparkly potatoes
I love these I tried these out in like
an Instagram video and they were great
and I use them all the time you can't
mix them in your foundation you can mix
it in your body lotion for your body a
glow this product is not a gimmick this
is a serious product and it is to be
used very seriously so the great thing
about these that I find is that they
work with powder so I just baked my put
my place my face and it doesn't really
matter with these drops because they
still just blend out fine so I'm gonna
hit the sponge with a little bit of mac
fix+ and then I wonder who got me in a
mac fix+ probably my sister it's just
like a natural but yet blinding glow
hold it the world needs that is so
pretty oh okay eyebrows are on and I'm
gonna go ahead and pry my lid with the
love this is the Smashbox primer and
Sydney black uses this and it works so
well she's this often I do believe on
her channel and she got me into it and
it's great I should a primer also like
it because it has color to it so it
definitely like she sent her video which
is what got me onto it said it helps to
alleviate or cover the discoloration
alleviate covered the discoloration and
I do have discoloration on my eyelids
that are a little bit of a red brown
color which I don't mind use in mind
like I've eyeshadow on when I don't
maybe not but we can pretend that it
does anyway so it just helps to cover
that and even though with this nice base
and you're ready to start and I like the
way it feels to it gets a little bit
tacky that right there is leftover
eyelash glue so pretend it's not there
for my eyeshadow palette today I'm going
to be using the juubi is place the
nubian 2 palette and it looks like this
really beautiful colors and I'll go
ahead and tell you the reason I'm using
this is because negative toriel's uses
these palettes and like every tutorial
that she does and I mean can we talk
about her makeup Jesus so good it like
shaketh me I say shook I her makeup
skills they're amazing
so I'm gonna be using this palette today
because I'm Nikki I actually bought my
palettes because of Nikki I was like
okay I'm obsessed first I'll go in with
a Madagascar within our 39 brush is this
just a matte brown color it also has
that kind of like pukey puke e undertone
to it which you guys know I'm a sucker
for I love a good light pukey
yellow-green so I'm just blending this
right in the crease of my r39 brush so
if you guys notice I'm keeping this
color mostly in my crease and not really
putting it on my eyelid cuz I want to do
like a sparkly look I haven't done one
in a long time and then when I was out
this weekend because it was new your New
Year's of course I wore a lot of sparkly
makeup but now I just want to keep
wearing it so lets woman do I'm gonna
take some jezebel which is this purpley
shade i legit just put a tiny bit on the
tip of the brush and then I'm just gonna
pop it right into that crease this is
such a pretty color I'm going to take a
dab of the Tarte shaped a concealer and
m41 brush to carve out the crease
I'm gonna grab a bit of this gold shade
right here on the same brush Nicky Nicky
Nicky you're responsible for these two
and I've been using these for a really
long time but these are the heavy metal
glitters from urban decay and they are
like the best okay so I'm just gonna
take you can use them like an eyeliner
or you can use them all over the lid you
use them how you want to but I'm
actually gonna apply this all over my
eyelid and make this look sparkly
they're so easy look how it makes the
eyelid look kind of wet Oh salt pretty
huh I'm gonna grab a bit of Kenya and
I'm just gonna define that crease oh
just a little bit more for eyeliner this
is just like my favorite liner that I
use every day so I don't have a youtuber
that recommended a liner so I'm just
gonna wing it out I'll be using with it
the the morphe into 50-1 brush which is
my favorite eyeliner brush to use with
gel liner I'm gonna go ahead and wing it
out
girl my wing liner is popping so I am
going to now add mascara and I'm gonna
use this lash paradise mascara from
L'Oreal Takhti is 100% responsible for
this and this is an amazing drugstore

Miami by Lily lashes he wears these
every single day to the point where I
was just like time I loved and I'll I

a Miami on and they are the best so yeah
I love them I'm gonna take an M 408
brush and grab that purple shade Jezebel
and just blend it and now I'm gonna take
a white teen brush and just soften that
up with a little bit of the Madagascar
which was the first shade that we used

that lash paradise from L'Oreal to my
lower lashes I'm gonna add this pretty
