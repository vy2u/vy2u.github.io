video is going to be a video jam-packed
full of clothing items that I just got
for this fall keep in mind it doesn't
get that cold in California so a lot of
the clothing that I picked out are not
like sweaters and stuff just because I
wouldn't be able to wear home really I
did do some serious shopping at a bunch
of different stores and I'm really
excited to share with you all the
goodies that I got Wow thumbs up if
you're a Shopaholic I did want to say
that I am gonna be at beautycon New York
so if you're gonna be there I will be
super excited to see you and I also want
to mention really quick in this video
that I happened on periscope and I make
doing live sessions so follow me on
periscope Laura 88 Lee and I tweet and
snapchat you guys before I do a large
session so you know that's all my
announcements let's jump right in
I can't wait to show you my club the
first item I want to talk to you guys
about is a watch that I got I don't even
own a warrant so I finally got a really
nice watch which I'm super excited about
this is a Daniel Wellington watch I'll
have the link down below for everything
so this watch is really pretty it's very
feminine and it comes in this nice
leather packaging but I love the watch a
watch looks like this and it is Navy and
pink they have a bunch of different
watches on their website but I chose
this one so I thought it was super cute
and feminine and girly and I love girly
watches and I wanted to try something
different so I chose this one but I just
thought the watch was adorable and it
has rose gold detailing around it very
nice watch so I'm very excited to wear
this out I thought I would share this
watch with you because I did get some
clothes and shoes and this is the only
accessory that I got so yeah super
pretty next we'll talk about clothes and
then we'll jump into shoes ease so far
is cliff gear I'll show you what I got
from Toby you guys know I love the
website Toby so much I will spend my
whole life on there if I'm not careful
like three days will go by and I'm still
on the web site on my home first item
that I got is this beautiful little
skirt it's actually a maxi skirt but
this has two slits on each side that go
almost all the way up
I love the Mavi pink color that it
is because it's not really springtime II
just because it's like this brown pink
color and then it is super chic in showy
showy because it comes with this little
bandeau top as your top with the skirt
so it's a matching set and I think it's
the cutest little thing in the world and
not to mention that it's super
lightweight but good quality material so
it's comfortable to wear like super
comfortable to wear EXA got a skirt
which isn't necessarily a full-time
color but i doll the skirt which is
absolutely beautiful and it was very
unique in the design of the skirt and I
love anything Barbie pink I saw it I had
to have it and plus whenever I go out in
LA and stuff this is like the stuff that
I like to wear especially with the
unique shape of the dress and how its
cut out and it fits really well so this
brand is actually tee and Cup but I got
it off Toby's website then I got another
dress that is a hot pink color and again
I bought it because it is a unique
cutout of the dress I just thought it
was so freakin pretty I love the way
it's like a big crisscross across the
front I have some ruching down by the
legs it's a super pretty well fitted
dress and it just zips in the bag just
in case you're wondering how to put it
on I also adore the sleeves I think the
sleeves that is just so original and
different I'm so happy to finally find
something different to wear out in a
belt and not that same old same old body
con dresses that I always wear this next
piece is probably my favorite item that
I got off Toby's website and it is this
top I couldn't believe it was still in
stock and I believe it still is so I'll
link it I'll link everything there I
always do just like a plaid but it's
just like really bold plaid a font on it
her font what am I talking about this is
not letters who had a ring on it and I
love the black and white color black and
white everything yes yes look assured
I'm wearing today black and white yes
honey then I love love love the ruffles
at the bottom it just makes the shirt
everything oh this sure is super super
thick and well made I warn you so it did
get a little hot when I was wearing it
just because it's so nicely made
it's not like a thin little pootie sure
this is a really good char the next
shirt I wore I took a picture I put up
on Instagram of me wearing cuz I wear on
my birthday
I'm hello it is this little shirt here
from Tobi and it has like all the
Victoria's Secret models on it so yeah
you're all I lunch of absolutely
fabulous women and I'm so so so excited
to have found this shirt and plus like
I'm wearing this shirt today it's kind
of similar
I love comfortable graphic tees like
this they are everything and they match
everything what does that piece of hair
doing all right I got one more piece
from Tobi and then we'll jump into the
Victoria's Secret stuff that I got
because I'm addicted to buying
Victoria's Secret pink clothes get this
little it's pretty plain but it's black
so it's just one of those outfits that
whenever I have nothing to wear I will
go and wear this and I think it is
absolutely gorgeous how the bottom
splits up like pretty high I just think
it gives it some sass rather than just
like a plain black maxi dress it just
gives a little attitude and I like how
it has elastic around the waist so it
just keeps the skirt up from from the
dress from being too heavy because it
rushes up at the waist a little bit I
love the halter top too to it I'm so it
gives it a great secret I have problems
so we'll talk about the her sweatshirt
and it looks like this it is just a
plain black sweatshirt however it's
really not that thick which makes me
happy because in California I would be
too hot to wear something like this but
it's like a medium thickness to it it's
not too heavy it's not a real sweatshirt
it's like a medium Swisher I don't know
what I'm trying to say but I really like
how they put the pink up on the shoulder
rather than like across the front it
just I mean don't get me wrong I love my
tacky pink clothing but it's like bag I
got some of those shirts too but I want
it one with a little less detail on it
but still says Victoria Secret pink okay
yes please and thank you
I picked another zip up sweatshirt
jacket and you guys are the one that
told me to get it because I was
snapchatting while I was shopping as
usual and I saw this I just love this
color it's like this beautiful baby blue
and I have had
this really two weeks now but I still
wanted to include it in this hall
because it is still Purcell epic tour
secrets and it's still a new considering
for me so key yeah it's only 40 bucks
which for a Victoria Secret zip up
jacket that was a good deal okay can get
pricey they try to get loud at
Victoria's Secrets with them prices on
them t-shirt and I bought few shirts um
because here at pink I told you guys I'm
addicted to them they're so pretty
they're so comfortable too so I got this
one this one is super plain which I love
the super plain shirts actually wear
this out one night with my white jeans
and like a plaid shirt tied around my
waist it was super cute so just gray
really really stretchy tee so
comfortable then at the loudest most
summertime Essure ever why did they get
it I have no idea just bear with me
because I did it it was 26 95 and I
don't know why but when I saw it I fell
in love I fell madly in love with it I
love the floral pattern so much and it's
another one they're stretchy like comfy
tees lastly I got a really good deal but
this weekend I was going they had these
little tanks for $10 well click cheaper
than a forever 21 shirt and it's just
like a little workout sure because I
have started running it's like the
biggest challenge of my life but I'm
going to keep doing it and I'm gonna be
a runner again and yeah I will not get
hit by a car in this shirt so obsessed
with it and then it just says peg push
they would make one that said pang click
PA inkay pag like one that'd be funny I
would buy it then I bought a couple of
their body sprays however I can only
find one of them I bought the green one
and then about the sweet and flirty I
just think these are great and they're
at the checkout counter for people who
are impulse buyers like yours truly a
couple other things from a boutique and
it's called J be boutique but I got some
clothes from them I got this cute little
skirt which is a suede material and then
it has these little fringy French recess
ass down the side it's super cute and it
just zips up in the back and I think
that's a material of this makes this
perfect for fall and it's black like my
favorite
hello yeah I got another skirt from the
same website and it is like this quarter
raw material and then it buttons up in
the front like all the way up in the
front this skirt reminds me so much of
the 90s I don't know what to do but they
are coming back and they are coming back
quick so I'm going to try to wear this
with some tall boots or something like
that I think we can make this skirt
super cute and trendy at least I'm going
to attempt to and then I got this little
white mesh top from that website it is
so cute I think this can be worn I don't
know how I want to wear this yet but I
think I'm gonna put it in my leather
skirt with a black bra and just be like
really trendy one night and wear this
out possibly with a chunky necklace do
you ever see I don't look close and you
just like and visualize what you can do
with them you're just like yeah and then
I also got from the JB we take this
little crop top right here and then it
kind of Criss crosses in the front so it
gives it a little bit of detailing and
it comes up pretty high on the neck it's
almost like a turtleneck crop top it is
so cute and I love olive green all green
is becoming one of my favorite colors to
wear which I never really thought it
would be but whenever I put it on I just
love olive green I think it's such a
good complementary color for my skintone
so I have been rocking a lot of olive
green and you'll probably see me wearing
the shirt a lot it's correct guys from
adora million it is a really cute skirt
and it's kind of hard to tell like how
cute it is unless you're in person but
the front of the skirt is like this
pleather material and then the back of
its caught in and then in the back it
does this cute little fancy crisscross -
really girly up the skirt and I also
love the baby pink neutrally colored
that it is so you can pair so many great
things with it this isn't necessarily a
fall time skirt this more so definitely
reminds me of this spring so I don't
know that I'll be wearing it until the
spring really I mean who knows I'll
probably wear like tomorrow or something
that's how the clothing items I got now
I'll show you some of the shoes that I
got a I got these the most girliest
printed shoes of life have a gold hill
and then they're just like black suede
with the biggest bow that goes around
your ankle these are from shop rocks
calm and they are cutie patootie they
have like a ton of shoes on their
website and I just love them so I had
sharing with you if you pull me on
snapchat you already saw these but oh
you're from ego calm and they give me a
discount code for the website I'll put
that down in the description box but
these are like ass white ass white hey
old horror get swayed Hill and then they
have these little holes which give them
so much detail and then they lace up in
the back oh I got a fresh pair of vans
I love Anne's tennis shoes who doesn't
they're like the most durable
comfortable cute shoes ever I got these
ones which kinda like heads so these are
the like smaller version ones these were
fifty and they just have their black
with like a pretty floral print and I
think these are really pretty for Paul
time especially a little sneaker to wear
around and like I said they are so
durable they're well worth the money
Ashley I finally got a new purse I'm one
of those people who carry the same purse
for like three years I'm not a big purse
shopper I am moreso of a shoe khlo
jewelry makeup everything else in the
entire world shopper I got this person
H&amp;amp;M it was super affordable I think it
was like 39 bucks and it's square shaped
and it's really deep and I love it it
has two pockets on the side and the
zipper pocket on the inside and I want
to say that I have another one of their
Frenchy purses and they are so durable
they can go through hell and they will
still survive so I love these purses and
