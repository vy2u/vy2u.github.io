I hope you guys are excited about seeing
this tutorial and we're gonna jump right
in and get started first things first
I'm gonna go in and fill in my eyebrows
with my NYX micro brow pencil and
Express though if you're in the market
for an affordable brow pencil I highly
recommend this one to you because it is
the bomb diggity then I will go in with
my NYX dance to tide eyes shadow as my
transition shade I'm gonna be blending
that in with a 820 fiber from Sigma but
if you were wanting more drugstore
brushes I will link some good ones that
I've used in the past down in my
description so there is those options
but basically I'm just gonna blend back
and forth into the crease with this
color I did prime my eyelids beforehand
with a little bit of concealer and you
seeming use that concealer torch the end
of this video then going in with
glistening garnet this is a L'Oreal
infallible pigment and a little bit of a
smaller brush I'm gonna focus this color
right into the crease I am taking a
little by little color and building it
up this is just gonna give us a little
bit of a warm cranberry feel to our
blackout smokey eye for fall time the
shade cranberry reminds me of all time
so much cranberry everything cranberry
acai yes girl and I'm gonna take my time
blending it that out making sure there
was absolutely no harsh line and
everything is seamless then I'm gonna go
back in with that 825 brush and I'm
gonna blend a little bit more with it
look like this you definitely want to
take your time with blending well I mean
I guess that's with any look right then
I'm gonna go in with this eye studio by
Maybelline this is gel liner and I'm
gonna take this little cos tape liner
brush you can use a little bit bigger
brush if you want to and I'm gonna apply
this all over the lid the reason I'm
doing is this is because black eye
shadow can be really patchy and not show
up as bold as we want it to but by
applying a black base where I lid this
is really gonna enhance that color so
this is an awesome trick to do with any
eyeshadow that you're gonna be covering
the whole lid with today I'm just gonna
grab this matte black color out of my
Maybelline the nudes palette you can use
any matte black eyeshadow you have on
hand
and with a real techniques blush or Real
Techniques brush
whoo I'm gonna pack this on to that lid
I'm taking a little by little color and
just building it up and then I'm gonna
spend a lot of time right here in the
crease trying to blend out that harsh
line because that harsh line is not okay
it gots to go so as you can see I take a
little bit of color swipe back and forth
with a super light hand that way we
weren't getting the shadow any crazy
places we're keeping it intact where we
placed it then I'm going to grab the
lightest shade from the Maybelline nude
palette and I'm gonna apply that to the
brow bone just to tie the look together
together and give us a little pop next
for mascara I'm gonna be using this
loyal butterfly mascara and I'm just
gonna apply a few coats of it nothing
serious because we are gonna be applying
a false eyelashes I'll be using that I
lower lashes with Vegas nay and
grands glamour these lashes are Viva
boom
they are drama and I just love them they
are super feminine too and they are
awesome from the drugstore so check them
out then I will work on my face going in
with the NYX shine killer this is a skin
at primer and it just helps to prevent
any shininess going on then I will go in
with my Maybelline matte and poreless
foundation and just apply that all over
my face I'm gonna be blending it out
with my f88 kabuki which is my favorite
brush to blend out my foundation it just
helps it look nice flawless and seamless
and I love this foundation so much it's
the perfect shade for me I'm and Shay to
20 and I wear it it's probably one of my
most worn foundations it's awesome you
guys should check it thing I'm gonna go
in with the Maybelline better skin
concealer I'm gonna apply this to the
under eye area to highlight my face a
little down the nose the forehead the
usual areas and I'm just gonna blend
this out by doing a little bit of
padding that way we're not moving the
color around too much then I'm going to
set all of this concealer with my
favorite powder I'm gonna be using my
NYX CC correcting powder and banana so
this one it will brighten you for days I
just applied it all over the concealer
and then I swiped away the excess with a
clean a little fluffy brush as far as
bronzer this was the first time I used
my makeup revolution palette and the
color was a little bit yeah too warm for
me unfortunately so I don't know that
this palette is the right shape for me I
am using an elf blending brush here or
like this little contour brush from ELF
I'll try to find it and link it down
below because I definitely think it's
worth the money and then I'm also gonna
contour the nose
I typically contour my nose with an
eyeshadow brush just to get in there and
not to get too much color moved around
then I'm gonna go in with this baked
blush from Milani pop it onto the apples
of my cheeks I think this one's called
love amore this one is a super pretty
flattering fall time blush then I'll go
in with Dan citize to finish up the eyes
I'm just gonna blend out on the lower
lash line with this little short shader
brush and now to smoke it out I'm gonna
go in with again with that black
eyeshadow from the Maybelline
dude palette and I'm gonna apply that
from inner to outer corner on the lower
lash line and taking my time blending it
back and forth then I'll just take a
little bit of that gel liner and apply
it in the waterline and this is just
gonna make it even dark and more sultry
yes girl then I'll go in and add a few
strokes of this mascara to my lower
lashes trying to be careful not to touch
the skin and lastly taking razzin no
it's raisin hello by elf cosmetics it's
just a lip liner and I liked it so much
I just ended up doing it my whole entire
lips with it and I think it's such a
beautiful color for fall that is it for
this look give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed don't forget to into the
giveaway and I'll see you all in my next
video bye guys when you just don't care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
