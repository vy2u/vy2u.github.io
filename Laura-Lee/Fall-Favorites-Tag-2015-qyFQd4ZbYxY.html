excited how much lipstick do I have on
my teeth how about the whole tube of
lipstick on my teeth right now great so
for today's video because today's video
is going to be the fall tag the fall tag
mani tagged me in this video and I just
love him to difficult but Manny's
channel I love mani outside of YouTube
well he's like the same person very high
hey mani is such a delightful person and
anytime I'm around him I smile just cuz
he's so happy and so positive and just
so full of joy he tied me to do the fall
tag so thank you Manny
for tagging me I'll send a call with
Jung wall and polish tag me to do this
video so thank you so much Nicole I love
the cold of death and I will have maybe
a Nicole's tag video down below if you
want to check out theirs and see what
they picked for their call tags
I believe Jacqueline Hill created this
video or created all the questions and
stuff with a pause hack and it's just
kind of been going around and I'm gonna
be tagging some people as well so be
sure to check out all the peoples
channels that I tagged and yeah cuz I'm
going to tag some amazing friends of
mine here on YouTube I'm gonna try not
to tag the same people that mania Nicole
tag that's gonna be really freaking hard
okay just a few questions it's nothing
too crazy I'm really excited to share
this video with you guys give it a
thumbs up really gonna jump right in and
get started so let's do this time okay
all my question is right down on my
handy-dandy little notebook right here
and the first question is what is your
favorite fall candle and of course it's
gonna be a bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks candle too
and I literally sat there for five
minutes contemplating what my actual
favorite one of all of them are and I
even had Tyler helping me I was like
Tyler if we could only have one what
would it be it was like that who wants
to be a millionaire with the questions a
B C or D our number one candle was
leaves we have it we burned it one time
because this camera
candle is so sacred to us that we
literally would like okay we are like
you could have burned it on special
occasions
that's how big of psychopaths we are
over this candle and about all of the
wall flowers and leaves and they're all
around my house house whenever you open
the door just smells like one big of
leaf it smells like a dagger
but I do have a runner-up and I'm gonna
mention it really quickly okay so it is
apple pumpkin pancakes and it's green
and it makes me so happy this candle can
make the most pissed off person in the
world a happy person that is how good it
smells mmm
honestly I had it burning in the back of
my videos this is pumpkin pie but I had
this one I'm burning in the back of my
videos and I was like I feel like I'm
not appreciating the candle enough by
just it burning long talking like I need
to appreciate it and burn it wow I can
like concentrate on the fact that the
candles burning I don't know I'm being
weird who mix candle is I mean the next
candle do you hear me the next question
is what is your favorite fall lip color
and I'll swatch for you a few and I had
one on my lip and I was like okay out of
the three which one is it gonna be like
if you're stranded on a desert island
you can only have one full lip color
which one would it be
and I chose Veronica by Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick hopefully
this was it this one is in stock because
I hate what I mentioned thanks to you
guys it's not in stock that's so
annoying I know am i crooked I feel like
I'm crooked this is it right here at the
darker one and it's just so pretty oh I
just love it so much and I especially
love pairing colors like this with a
neutral eye wham bam thank you ma'am
yes favorite fall drink so I'm gonna
mention a Starbucks drink and I don't
drink lattes I don't drink coffee I
don't drink any of that jazz because I
am a soda drinker and that's how I get
my energy and caffeine I encouraging
anybody to be a soda drinker with that
it's just my preference but anyways
whenever I go to Starbucks in the
summertime I get the passion fruit tea
but in the fall time the only thing I
get from them is the Plain Jane
hot chocolate preferably no whipped
cream on top I know crazy right like
literally can I get the plainest thing
on the menu please and thank you my
favorite fall blush this one was very
easy this is the same blush that was my
favorite fall blush last year and it is
breezy by Mac I just love this is like
the fall color it's such a beautiful
cranberry color and another thing that I
really like about this blush I'm wearing
it right now but my lights oh look at
that highlight
sites are kind of like flushing it out
but another thing I like about this
color a lot is it is a beautiful
eyeshadow so instead of buying like
another cranberry shade eyeshadow if you
have this blush by Mac or if you get it
you can use it as a beautiful fall time
I shut up favorite fall time clothing
item besides the plaid shirt that I'm
wearing now that I've been wearing for
three days straight because I'm a psycho
and I won't take it off because it just
is so comfortable
besides this shirt another item that I
can't stop wearing is this jacket and
it's like so lightweight and it's only a
quarter sleeve I guess it's long sleep
but I keep it rolled up and it's so cute
from Windsor and I slip this hunter
green color and it comes down pretty
long it's just so grunge but this is
coming in style I feel and I love it
I'll pair it with black jeans blue jeans
white jeans anything they don't want a
pair of this jacket with I feel like it
goes this is such a good color and I
feel like there's a fly flying around my
room feel like this color right here is
my color and I like there's very few
things I feel like I know about myself
like I know that it looks really good on
me but I feel like this olive green is
made for me I mean there are these socks
