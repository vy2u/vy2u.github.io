all right jumping right in this tutorial
wasting absolutely no time I'm going to
go in with Peach Smoothie from makeup
geek and an e 40 blending brush from
Sigma and I'm just going to blend this
basically all over the eyelid this is
going to soften up the primer I have
down which is Mac soft ochre then I'm
going to go in with creme Brule by
makeup geek and I'm using an e25 brush
which is my all-time favorite brush that
ever existed and I'm going to blend this
into the crease
this is going to be our transition shade
and make everything flow together and
much easier to blend so I'm just going
to pop that into the crease makes mainly
focus it on the upper crease then I'm
going to go in with Swiss chocolate I
love this very unique brown color and
I'm going to blend that on the outer V
area of the eye and kind of work it up
into the crease a little bit using that
same good ol e 25 brush from Sigma you
can't beat it with a stick this is
literally the best brush that ever
existed I promise you anyways and I'm
just gonna blend blend blend until my
arm falls off and runs away and then I'm
going to go back in with another
blending brush and I'm going to blend it
out some more then I'm going to go in
with a mocha from makeup geek and I'm
going to darken it up and create some
dimension in the crease so as you can
see I'm just working on that outer edge
of my eye mainly and then focusing a
little bit of it in the crease just
going back in and building it up the
more colors we layer the softer and more
gradient this look is going to look so I
just keep going back and forth back and
forth with this brown eyeshadow which
actually looked a little bit purple with
the lining I don't know what was up with
that anyway said I'm gonna go in with
pink champagne buy on Sacha Beverly
Hills oh this car it gives me life like
it literally makes me a happy person
when I look at this color so I'm going
to go in with a 58 shader brush from
Sigma and pack this onto the lid as you
saw I did damping because it with a
little bit of mac fix+ spray I discussed
this on a periscope session if you
dampen your colors with mac fix+
it enhances them times a thousand next
I'm going to go in with a bitten from
makeup geek and this is just going to
warm up the look a touch and give it a
little bit of color that way it's not
just like brown and sparkle it just has
like
and a polar this step is optional then I
will go in with corrupt which is just a
plain matte black eyeshadow and I'm
going to deepen that outer V once more
and make it super dark and super pretty
and just blend blend blend it out doing
the same thing to the other eye
I absolutely love this makeup look I
think it will look flattering on anyone
who wants a glamorous night out then I
go in with treasure and pop it on the
brow bone and this is gonna highlight
our brow bone and tie the whole entire
look together yes girl we see you I love
how I look back at the camera sometimes
then I'm going to go in with my favorite
black gel liner this is the morphe black
gel liner and I tried out using this
Tarte liner brush and I didn't like it
like the struggle is real so then I just
went in with a little bit in my NYC
liquid liner and went over it to sharpen
it up because we got to make sure it's
sharp enough to kill somebody oh yeah
then I cleaned up clinda cleaned up the
outer edges and I'm gonna pop on some
mascara I am NOT trying to LinkedIn or
build up my lashes because I'm going to
add falsies but if you don't want to
wear false lashes do not wear them why
does someone always text me during a
forever I'm going to be popping on
smokey muse by house of lashes these are
currently my favorite lashes ever they
are brand new by house of lashes and I
think they're still in stocks okay
I had already added my primer and
foundation which I used to make up
forever primer and foundation this
foundation is the bomb calm so we're
just gonna jump right into highlighting
I used the NARS creamy radiant concealer
and custard and I've just highlighted my
face with it and then I'm going to blend
it out with this beautiful blush from
Sigma let's see this is the tapered
kabuki f-86 and I'm just going to blend
everything out make it look nice and
gradient next I'm going to go in and set
it with the laura mercier translucent
powder I'm going to pack this on this is
going to make the concealer not crease
is also going to make it last that's why
you see me sprinkling it kind of all
over my face because I want my
foundation and concealer to last then
I'm going to go in with the good ole
anastacio contour my book has seen
better days or palette has seen better
days and this brush is from makeup
addiction it's so old and crusty but I
love it to contour with so I'm just
gonna runs up the face and itches a lot
of those cheekbones then I'll run a
little bit down my nose just to give my
nose a more straight appearance you
don't have to contour and do all this if
you don't want to you can just bronze up
your face it's up to you then I'll go in
with a little bit of Milani
very a more faked flush such a beautiful
color and a beautiful highlight which is
gilded honey but laura geller you can
buy this online at Ulta I'm going to pop
this onto the upper cheekbone holy Lord
can we go yeah we see you AHA then I'm
going to enhance everything by giving it
9,000 spritz a mac fix+ spray next I
will go back in with a little bit of
that creme Brule color I'm just going to
blend that back and forth I think I have
a little bit of Swiss chocolate mixed in
this too and then I'm going to take with
this awesome brush here this is the flat
definer 80 15 by Sigma I'm going to
really tight line the lower lash line
with a little bit of corrupt which was
that blacks matted mascara next I'll
fill in the waterline with a little bit
of black eyeliner just really smoke out
this book then I will go in with some
lip liner okay I had seriously Liv
troubles today because first I'm going
in with spice by Mac and I was like why
am i using this color it is not gonna
match the lip shade of any new so then I
went back over it with cork by Mac which
did not match the liquid lipstick so you
know what I just put the liquid lipstick
on and SEC Hill with it I went in with
sepia by Anastasia Beverly Hills which
is a really unique color but I did love
it with the eye look they paired
together really well so pop on this and
basically that's it for this look I hope
