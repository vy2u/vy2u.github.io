is going to be best of elf makeup
mementos whether the products from elf
then I love the most because as most of
you know with the brand L they're not
allowed a hit and misses there's a lot
of amazing products for such a great
price and then there's a lot of products
that look amazing that are in I'm so
great and I was gonna film a best of Mac
like show you my favorite Mac products
and I still might do that but I kind of
felt like I was beating a dead horse
because I talked about Mac so much on my
channel you guys basically you know what
I love her bag but I might let me know
again in the comments what I need to do
we're gonna get started with this elf
videos the first product I mentioned
from elf that I just live are their
prism palettes and I only have two of
them I have sunset and naked naked is
the more neutral e1 and then sunset is
the ones that has two pink in it I have
done tutorials with both of these you
just have to search them on my channel
they're just titled drugstore makeup
soils or something like that bad or
drugstore in them these palettes run ten
dollars a piece and they are well worth
your ten dollars keep in mind one back I
shadow that's not in the pod is ten
dollars so you're getting all these for
$10 and I find that they last a little
bit longer on the lid whenever you wet
them if you don't let them and apply
them to your lid I find that they kind
of wear off easily and I don't have dry
eye lids so whenever I put them down
into my crease they kind of set and they
look good but just on the lid I feel
like you need to wet them I personally
like cheese mac fix+ pray on them but
you can just use water if you want to
they're beautiful they're super
pigmented they are all shimmery colors
so you definitely don't get a matte and
I do prefer a map I show to do a
complete makeup look but they're ten
bucks
the colors are super pigmented super
shimmery they're beautiful they kind of
look like a foiled pigment and I'm all
about them next we'll talk about
something that's like been in my
collection since the dawn of the
dinosaurs this is the Mac HD or High
Definition powder and I do I love this
powder whenever
I'm at home and it's a great transition
transition is a great translucent powder
and it does its job really wonderfully
just soaking up those oils on the face
or you can just Pat it on the areas that
you know you're gonna get greasy during
the day and it does an excellent job of
preventing that and just saving you your
time from all the grease but the only
thing that I don't like about it is it's
not compacted I don't care for loose
powders that much because I wear the
tresses and powder I like to carry it
with me and use that as my touch-up
powder and I can do that with this
because we'll have white stuff
everywhere so I definitely go to my Mac
press powder one I wish else would come
out with a pressed powder one because I
bet it would be awesome but I do like
this one for at home moving right along
this is the elf BB cream with SPF 20 in
it and I only like this one for days
that I'm not gonna be really wearing any
makeup no mascara or anything like that
and I know I'm gonna be outside such as
a golf day a beach day whatever life may
bring to me it is an excellent BB cream
super sheer coverage has lots of
sunscreen in it and that's what's most
important to me however you do have to
set this because I do find it is a
little bit too lotion E or too creamy
and if my forehead is gracyk eraser
whenever I wear this use it just you
just want to be sure to set it and you
can set it with yours truly our HD
powder next product is actually pretty
much a dupe for Mac's shell if you don't
know what Mac shell it is their cream
like highlight and it's like one of the
most beautiful highlights ever this is
lilac petal and I got this off of shop
mist a calm it was a dollar they have
some elf stuff on that website it's a
jewelry site so random I know it's shiny
that's all you need to know you can put
it wherever you want to I mean you can
put it on your eyelids if you wanted to
like in my tricks video you can run it
down the shin of your leg make your legs
look super long like a supermodel I
personally like to use it just on the
high points of my cheeks and a little
bit down the nose to give me that shimma
shimma this was again a dollar and it is
so awesome for a dollar
it is amazing I'm sure
at Walmart or Target the next product
we'll go into is the beloved shoes I
love their blushes I liked their older
blushes and the square packaging but I
wasn't like obsessed with them and I
mean I guess I'm not really like
obsessed with these but I do like one
lot they've done an excellent job with
them and I'm not gonna mention their
bronzer in this video because I felt
like it was a little bit chalky and you
know you normally put a little bit more
bronzer on your face than you do blush
you wouldn't like put blush all around
your face you just go in so light hand
it leave a blush well most of us do
I love the blushes and they pretty much
have the same texture as the bronzer
maybe a little bit more creamy but they
said on the face nice they are matte
they don't have any shimmer and oh these
are they're pressing their own blushes
and I have three of them and they're all
through my favorites I have jet setter I
have sweet retreats and look cabo coming
these three are awesome they're mineral
blushes I definitely recommend
especially if you want to expand your
malysh collection this is definitely a
cheap way to do so two more things to
Chetty us up about it's another blush
this is our HD cream blush and I don't
use cream blushes a lot but I did try
this one I think this one was $2.00 this
is like the thickest cream blush ever
like the tiniest amount was the craziest
long way but if you take like this
smallest possible amount on it and just
really lightly blend it into the apples
of your cheek and on back a little bit
it gives you a really nice natural
beautiful flush and I love that and
they're really long lasting cream blush
it's gonna last you way longer than a
powder and that goes with saying just
about anything that you should consider
your cream contour oh that mess it's in
the last longer because the cream so
this is just a great option especially
if you feel like your face eats makeup
blush is the first thing to go for you
guys and this cream blush is thanks
lastly I won't talk about this forever
because I mentioned it in my current
favorites but this is their smudge pot
as you guys know I don't really care for
their other smudge
that much but this one is just putting a
little gym to me this one is back to the
basics and it's gold and I wear gold
china and I wear gold eyeshadow all the
time show before I apply my gold
eyeshadow I like to use this as the base
to intensify that gold eyeshadow I am
wearing it today and I'm wearing a shape
any gold eyeshadow today thanks for
watching give a thumbs up if you want to
see more like one brand favorites videos
I love you guys and I hope to see you
all in the next video I got makeup all
over me and it's gonna get on my white
pants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
