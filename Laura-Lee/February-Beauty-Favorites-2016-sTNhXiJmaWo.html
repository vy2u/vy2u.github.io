right in and get started so I hope you
enjoy the video okay like every month
starting out we mentioned our favorite
song in the month and our favorite TV
show movie at the month so my favorite
song in the month is a song that stuck
in everybody's head and I tweeted it the
other day
and it rose a lot we just had that song
of our head why'd you just tweet this
Briana's Web go quick quick whipping and
then and then they live quick Shimon I
might not know what quickly words of the
song that I know so that's the only part
I could sing TJ's but I know you know
what song I'm talking about right let's
do it I just want to like where I want
to dance but the same comment would be
productive my favorite TV show of the
month is Nurse Jackie you guys hooked me
in to a thing or two watching that on
Twitter I'm always talking to you guys
on Twitter but you guys told me it's
such a good show and you all right the
show is about Nurse Jackie
she is a addict and she is an awesome
nurse but she basically screws up her
life with drugs and then the whole show
is about her trying to fix her life
which as soon as she fixes it she screws
it back up with drugs it's very
frustrating but a very good show to
watch so no Jackie is where it's at you
haven't seen it go watch we're gonna
finally jump into this is what the
products the good stuff so yes let's
talk first thing is first I want to talk
about these guys because I could not
tell you how many questions I get on
them the artiste brushes this video is
not sponsored by the artiste brushes I
saw these like on the internet I saw on
Instagram and I was just like that is
the stupidest most gimmick dumbest
overpriced product I've ever seen I will
never try them it's how I got them for
me a for Valentine's Day
cuz he knows I love like makeup and
stuff and he thought I had won
triumphant expensive yeah these are not
affordable they're just way overpriced
but anyways I tried them and they're
like the greatest thing ever
I swear to you guys I'm not joking I'm
not kidding I'm not over exaggerating
you can blend anything out with this in
seconds I will tell you I got the
smaller set which I have the bigger set
coming um so I used these for my face
this is the oval number four and number
six the bigger ones the bigger ones six
small ones for and I use these the four
to blend out the concealer to get up in
there use this one for Foundation which
getting the 10 for my foundation but
just to blend it out for the contour to
work so incredibly well but I really do
like the round number one and this is
for lip because I always blend my liquid
lipsticks like I rarely put on just one
liquid lipsticks I normally put in two
but you want to make sure they're nice
and blended this works so well they're
very soft and gentle on your skin
they're not like a scrubby brush
whatsoever I haven't decided how I want
to clean them I'm sure on the website on
the internet it tells you how to clean
them I'm sure I'll just use my regular
little cleanser I have I wouldn't
awkward amount of palettes I want to
talk to you guys about I fell in love
with the palette the first one is one
that is coming out by Too Faced I was
hanging out the toothpaste headquarters
not trying to brag or anything
they're awesome there they gave me the
peach palette it's called sweet peach
the palette smells just like peach rings
I will do a tutorial with this palette
so good I have it on my eyes today
I love the arrangement of colors in the
palette it's definitely a warm tone
palette my favorite color is probably
summer young and just peachy literally
living for this color arrangement here
it's gorgeous
it's such a great summer palette too so
I have just been dire love can we talk
about the packaging seriously seriously
favorite thing is just like the ombre he
goes from like a light peach all the way
to like an orange oh this brush I just
did a blog post on my favorite this is
literally soaking wet from the shower
bag just did a blog post on my favorite
skincare products if you wanna check
that out Laura Lee blogs calm I use this
like twice a week is a complete and
total dupe for the Clarisonic give me a
code Lorillard lead get like 70% off
which makes it super cheap like very
affordable and you get like additional
heads for the brush so you get like a
soft head or a more abrasive head you
like a pew --mess sponge and you get a
big head for your body so you get a
multiple heads and battery power so yeah
I don't worry about charging it I have
never changed the batteries in it and I
was
have had this for close to a year I love
this product it buffs away the dead skin
and just really polishes your skin and
it also gives the texture of your skin a
much smoother texture I am paying for
this brush it is worth every penny I
should just buy a new one because I've
just used it to absolute death new price
I really want to talk to you about that
I'm super excited about these launched
March first they did a pre-launch okay
first let me tell you what they are are
these you a new liquid lipsticks and the
thing I like about the most is they're
very creamy so they're kind of like I
don't know they're not like you're not
gonna get that crack you feel whatsoever
with these I love the arrangement of
colors there's not really any wild
colors they're all pretty simple but
they're gorgeous colors and she also
came out with some shimmery ones which
sold out really quick and the pre-launch
I think they're pretty much all sold out
now as far as when the pre-launch
happened but um they're gonna be back in
stop on the 1st of March held a rose I'm
pretty sure the name of this one it's a
complete do propose ek by Kylie Jenner
looks identical the same noisette I'm
probably butchering these but this is a
pretty brown color kinda like the one I
have on today kind of a dupe for the
sold out one by NEX sandstorm and noise
that next product the there are ten
lines by hoola um and I just realized
like after the fact that it comes with a
sponge that I actually I don't use the
sponge let me just put it that way um it
is a self tanner but it's like a jelly
it's weird
I don't want to squeeze it out cuz I'm
one of the blob of self tanner but it's
literally like a jelly look at it do you
see that I just used it with my um my
body blender by the Beauty Blender and a
hacks video I showed you how well that
works but um very very even tan with
this and you are able to build it up
really easily without getting an orange
tan so I apply like three full layers of
this to get a really dark tan but
because like the hoola bronzer is just
so cool tone
no orangie and it whatsoever the actual
bronzer that I love so much as well as
everybody else it's literally the best
contouring bronzer I feel like they took
the exact same shade obviously and
create a self-tanner so it has no orange
undertone in it which is exactly what
we're not going for whenever we're
self-tanning I'm really hot this
sweatshirt was such a bad idea
I just panicked when I mentioned to you
guys is this palette by violet Voss this
launches March the 3rd so it probably
won't be out by the time I upload this
video but this palette it reminds me of
the morphe 35o I'm not gonna talk about
what happened to the mirrored but just
know that Tyler was involved I mean I
didn't beat him with her or anything but
he did it he broke it get out literally
wanted it look so big everything looks
so big on my head February favorites
right there if you are a warm tone girl
this is like the goddess of warm tone
palette I am serious right now it has
the most beautiful shimmer and matte
colors I can gray a bazillion looks with
this palette shades are quite large that
you get a lot of I said it like white an
arrangement
I'm obsessed this palette you'll see
some looks with it yes general except on
my radar as a Beauty favorite is my face
first aid beauty this is the facial
radiance pad toner pads but they're
alcohol-free so they're not like stinky
stinky not stinky but stinky to your
skin they work awesome and what I like
to do with them is I pop them out right
before I do my makeup I know I do rub it
around my skin right before I do my
makeup and just clean everything out
that way we are working with like a
fresh really clean palette my have like
two left in this little big packet next
up is a product by Maybelline this is
the master prime long-lasting eyeshadow
primer and
I think that this is the best I should
have power at the drugstore seriously
bomb diggity it works so well they have
different shades in it and I only have
tried this shade but I feel like I like
this shade the best even though I
haven't tried the other shades I always
opt for a lighter I should have primer
that way it doesn't manipulate the
shades of my eyeshadow there I'm gonna
put on top of it so I just like stick
with the lightest one I don't know the
name of this one what are you this is I
don't even know see I don't know the
name of this one also notice the line
this one and I love it next time again
next part I'm in love and this is almost
empty well write this up at like Walmart
no Target
no I think this is like the grocery
store like Mons it was weird I saw it
there and I wanted it so I got it this
is a Juergen what Jurgens wet skin
moisturizer and it's like how when this
gimmicky things were like is this gonna
work or is it gonna be stupid but it
works
it's so cool like when I'm in the shower
I just rub this all over my body even
after I finish and my legs and I don't
even have to like apply lotion sometimes
I still do though cuz I can be really
ashy and actually it doesn't look good
on anybody you feel a little bit greasy
I'm not gonna lie but I love like that
lotion II feel like lathered in lotion
and that's like what this does for me if
they have two different scents um I like
the calming green tea oil another
eyeshadow palette shoutout to my friend
Manny mu ay Manny I am so proud of you
in this palette Manny is a fellow
youtuber as you guys know already but
there may be someone out there who
doesn't know when I need to let you know
but an awesome friend of mine too in the
beauty community and I just want to take
this time to congratulate me on this
palette we actually talked about this
palette months and months months ago and
he showed me pictures of it on his phone
and we were like
like freaking out giddy I didn't say a
word to anybody I kept my mouth shut and
here it is in my hands I can't believe
it's here
congratulations it's completely sold out
right now makeup geek is restocking this
pallet so hold tight people calling me
neon it's criminal he will be sure to
let you know when it will be back in
stock next up this product I have been
alluring this is speckled this is the
under makeup primer by Laura killer so
this is a cool product because it's
actually a primer that helps to make
your makeup last longer whenever you
apply this all over your skin it gives
your skin kind of like that I don't know
like a dampened sticky feel and then you
put your foundation and you feel like
your foundation is adhering to your skin
that way it's not going to slough off
really quick it also has like an opaque
iridescent pigment within it so it makes
your skin look really luminous I love
this product think it looks amazing
under multiple types of foundation so
I've been using this a lot lately bomb
diggity high that I have been loving is
the this is the strobe lighting powder
the ambient strobe lighting powder by
hourglass this one is an iridescent and
I like these a lot
I'm wearing this one today because um
I've just been seeing all over the
internet I don't know just people being
like I see these highlighters on
Instagram but what is that like in
person like a chunk of highlight you
know and how flattering can that be well
I mean I'm not knocking it because I'm
guilty of doing it but for those of you
who just you know you aren't feeling
that really strong strobe highlight on
the cheekbone area you are the product
for you they just give your skin that
natural a nice radiant glow instead of
like an actual like super highlight if
you are super high light person you may
not like this product because this isn't
gonna give you that crazy bold strobing
look this is gonna give you that soft
natural radiant glow care products I
wanna mention to you guys is by origins
this is the mask a miser mask you miser
mask I don't know but it looks like this
is sold at Sephora and stuff like that
wherever origins is sold but what it
does is you spray I've only tried it a
few times and I seem to like it
when you spray it on after you wash your
face and you're gonna do a facial match
you spit on your face before you put the
mask on and it helps to spread the mask
out and it helps your face - like in
take the mask it also it like
intensifies the mass that you use so it
like powers up the mask it helps it
spread out on your skin and not only
that it also hydrates your skin so a lot
of harsh masks will like dry out your
skin whenever you're trying to like
clear up a breakout or something but
this will also add some hydrants to your
skin I'm making up words I know that was
a lot of product but we went through it
we went through it that's it for my
favorites video thank you guys for
