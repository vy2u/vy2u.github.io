video is going to be another testing new
products video and I did this cool
makeup look for you right here my
highlights on fleek as well so go ahead
and have a look at that do you've your
sunglasses on do you I love the way this
look came out I wanted to do a different
type of makeup tutorial for you guys so
it's like all matte eyeshadow with a big
fleeky foiled liner also I'm gonna be
showing you guys how to do my hair how
straighten it with my t3 strainer hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you do be
sure to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't subscribed already we're gonna
jump right in and get started hope you
guys enjoy let's do it
we're gonna get started with hair first
because that's normally what I do when
I'm getting ready today I'm going to be
using the t3 single pass luxe to
straighten my hair and I typically
always run a brush through my hair as
I'm straighten it that way we get every
single piece of hair and none of the
hair is bunched up in the straightener
and that way it gives you a better
straight effect for your hair I promise
this method that works the best and if
you have thick hair like mine I like to
clip up the top half and straighten
piece by piece
what's special about the strainer is it
has tourmaline infused technology which
helps with the health of your hair as
you use it there style edge technology
helps the body of it glide slowly
through the hair that way it's not
pulling or ripping out your hair this
one it has adjustable heat settings 260
to 410 Fahrenheit I like to crank it all
the way up their hair tools are made for
any style of hair any type of hair any
condition that your hair is in I got
mine and the lugs gift set which comes
with a straightener and a hair clip by
Patricia Morales who is a jewelry
designer she designed this hair clip
just for the t3 gift set is rose gold
and it's so frickin pretty so next up
I'm gonna take the top half of my hair
and I like how little the straightener
is that way we can grab the hair all the
way at the root also like how it doesn't
make me have blunt ends that my hair
makes my hair soft it kind of flow with
the rest of it so it doesn't look sharp
and pointy at the end you know what I'm
saying sometimes straighteners just make
it way too blunt it makes your hair very
soft and don't forget to use my code
larlie SP luxe for a free gift with
purchase of everything linked down below
that's how I straight my hair I hope you
guys enjoyed the hair tutorial now we're
gonna jump into the makeup alright guys
first I'm gonna go in with my precisely
brow pencil for
benefit and I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows
next up I'm about to try out this elf
this is a clear this I think it's a brow
wax kind of scares gonna mess up my
eyebrows low-key let's see oh guys this
is a pretty heavy-duty brow wax holy
crap this stuff is a very strong brow
wax and it works very well I'm impressed
next up I'm going to add one heck of a
blot this is a primer by soap and glow
red I just get some on the back of my
hand and then I massage it into my skin
next up I'm going to be taking the
covergirl this is to clean matte liquid
foundation is for all control which i
think is perfect now that we're getting
into back-to-school season and I'm going
to give it a good shake and we're gonna
be trying this out today I got shade
soft honey which I'm hoping is kind of
my shade this is my Sigma f80 8 this is
the angled kabuki and I start to stipple
this on my skin which it looks like it's
matching my skin pretty well so it
actually goes on kind of shiny instead
of matte I would say it's a medium
coverage it's very liquidy so I wouldn't
want to put too much of it on my skin
for fear that I wouldn't it would like
get too cakey it's almost a sheer
coverage because I can see a lot of my
skin so it doesn't do a lot of covering
I'm not obsessed with it right now
we'll see how it wears throughout the
video cuz I'll be sitting here for
another good hour next I'm going to try
out the covergirl clean matte this is
their powder set it with which is
probably going to enhance the product
this is the F 25 brush from Sigma very
light powdery so that definitely
modified the foundation and give it a
little bit more coverage next up I'm
going to be trying out a new concealer
this one is from Kardashian Beauty it is
in shade light this is their no
apologies concealer and
and so far it's not extremely liquidy
which is actually what I thought it was
going to be which is good I'm going to
blend all this out with my f88 kabuki
brush and ooh guys which is hot
this concealer just blended it out too
literally nothing like it just vanished
off of my face oh look it's like
disappearing and it's like really what
what the hell was that I I'm gonna be
honest I had really high hopes for this
concealer I love the packaging it came
out kind of thick so I thought it's
gonna have full coverage it looks like I
don't have any concealer on right now
alright so anyways we're gonna be using
the Tarte shape tape concealer I do not
recommend that Kardashian beauty
concealer oh my god alright here I go
again I do adore the Tarte do you see
how this is postable into out concealer
like come on I'm just gonna add a little
bit of my Laura Mercier translucent
powder to set the concealer and I'm just
going to press it into my skin I'm going
to go ahead and move on to eyes and so
maybe you've requested me to start using
my larlie Bella Voss palette a little
bit more I'm going to be using this
today I have a creative look in mine I
hope it goes as planned this is the
palette that I did in collaboration with
violet ball the first color I'm gonna go
out is basic from my palette right here
it is a great universal color just to
set the lid I named this color after a
bunch of my friends next I'm going to go
into breeches which is just the greatest
transition color on this side of the
Mississippi River it is and I'm going to
lindblom that right into the crease and
then I take it all the way to the inner
corner all the way the outer corner go
back and forth like a windshield wiper
motion by the way I'm using an f-35
brush from Sigma this is their medium
blending brush which is just perfect for
medium size medium to small eyelids if
you have a little bit of a bigger
lid I recommend the Sigma e-40 brush
it's the same brush but the bristles are
a little bit longer in the brush is a
little bit bigger to cover your big
beautiful eyelid next I'm going to grab
a little bit of whiskers which is the
shade right here it's like an expresso
brown color using an e25 brush I'm going
to start blending that in the crease as
well taking all the way from inner to
outer corner I'm going to keep it a
little bit lower than Britches that way
it's not too dark too high up I'm also
gonna mix it with a little bit of bulbs
with just a little bit of a deeper brown
color to deepen it up I just dropped my
child next I'm going to dip into a bit
of fried which is like this dirty sandy
yellowish brown color I'm using an 8 32
brush from Sigma to do this and I'm
going to press fried all over the lid
with a clean ether tea brush I'm going
to go in with a little bit of sugar
which is this this really nice shimmery
shade and then apply right onto my brow
bone I'm also going to take a little bit
of sugar and pop it into that inner
corner next I'm going to be trying out
these Urban Decay metallic razor-sharp
liners this one is in gold rush it is a
very golden color and then I wing it out
I have no idea how this is going to turn
out so just wish me luck like this could
be a total flop if it is we'll figure
out what's gonna happen next one thing
about these liners is you definitely
want to shake them up because if you
don't the product separates and just
comes out as like a gooey liquid that's
interesting
whoa that's really pretty oh my gosh so
you can add a black liner whatever color
liner you want I just want to try
something different for once in a
tutorial and do some different liner
next I'm going to be trying for the
first time the new primer from L'Oreal
this is their volume Ness primer and
it's supposed to be really good from
what I hear so now we're going to apply
on top a little bit of mascara I've been
loving this one from Estee Lauder this
is the sumptuous waterproof bold I don't
even know sumptuous sumptuous this is
their waterproof bold um volumous
lifting mascara oh la la cual lashes
that primers not so bad guys they kind
of liked it for lashes I'm going to be
using spaced out these are by icon
lashes and they look like this they're
very pretty and spaced out
I'm going to using the contour case this
is my Kardashian beauty and I've already
used this and I liked it a lot this is
the f65 brush from Sigma that I'm going
to apply the product with and so I
noticed with this palette this product
blends out like so easy and it's very
pigmented I don't know what the hell
happened when their concealers they made
a really nice contour palette that do
you recommend if you want to get into
cream contouring I don't know about the
highlighter shade because I haven't
messed with that I typically don't use
the highlighter shade out of contour
palette I mean unless it's a powder
contour palette but I really love the
contour product next I'm going to be
going in with the blush and bronzer
palette this is a Coastal Scents palette
that came in my August boxycharm and it
also came with this cute little brush
actually going to use the brush and I'm
going to dip into both bronzers and mix
them together ones a little bit shimmery
than the other for my blush I'm going to
go in with a lighter shade from the
Coastal Scents palette this is an f15
brush from Sigma it's like a stippling
brush which is really nice to apply
blush you can see this very pigmented Oh
next up an exciting new product from
Oprah cosmetics this is their new
highlighter called
Rodeo Drive I'll use my Sigma F 35 brush
and apply this to my face
next up I'm going to dip into breeches
from the larlie bivalves palette every
time you say lordly and once you say by
the house and I'm just gonna blend that
on lower lash line now I'm going to go
into a little bit of my handy dandy
color fried like a fried piece of golden
chicken you know that looks like a piece
of fried chicken and I'm going to grab
just a smidge bit of britches and bring
it real close to that lower lash line
I'm going to add some tart in a rim
liner to my inner waterline to really
open the eyes up and make them pop I'm
going to add a little bit of mascara of
course to my lower lashes for my lips
I'm going to be using this hood of
beauty this is her liquid matte
I've already been using these a little
bit if you follow my Instagram you
already know that and if you aren't
pulling me on Instagram I would like to
know why not this one is in Venus and it
is pre Tay mm-hmm
do you all ever have those days when
your eyelashes are just acting plumb
stupid I don't have my kago Lee beauty
elixir with me so I'm going to be adding
a little bit mac fix+ spray to finish
off my look and that's it for this look
