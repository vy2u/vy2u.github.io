is going to be a fabulous flawless
foundation routine it's going to be
super full coverage as well how many
else can I say in the beginning of this
video can we count so I'm going to show
you how to get a really wallace makeup
look but it's going to be very very full
coverage covering everything this is a
routine they'd been doing for a while
this is how I get that full beat that
Instagram glam makeup look and what
we're going to be using any new
concealers from NARS these are the top
Mac complete concealers NARS and I've
really been enjoying them lately if you
follow me on Instagram then you already
know that they have a total of 16 shades
so you can definitely find your shape in
this I like to use need to call my
eyebrows out to conceal to highlight to
contour the you should sorry here are
three of my favorite shades what I like
to contour with is keiko dark - it looks
like this as well as custer medium one
is my favorite and then there's also
candle light this is light 2.75 here is
a close-up of swatches the darker one is
Caicos the middle one is custard and
candle light is the one on the end there
I like it because of the coverage you
get but also you get this flawless
natural looking finish which isn't too
cakey or crazy looking so I'm really
been going down rage ever in the video
show you how use them as well as a
couple other parts that I use to get
this look awesome you're still hanging
out with me in the intro I just wanna
let you guys know I'm giving away two
MacBook Airs
I'm giving away one for being a
subscriber to my channel so all you have
to do is subscribe I'm giving away the
other one to being a subscriber for my
vlog channel so subscribe to my channel
f lauralee blogs this giveaway is going
to end on March 15 so hurry of enjoying
me if you're already subscribed to my
channel then you're already entered so
we're going to jump right in and get
started let's go okay I starting out
this is my skin and what I like to do
first is typically prep my skin today
I'm going to be using the easy way
anti-aging moisturizer primer now if
your skin is oily you might want to use
a anti-shine primer or if you're doing
with pores of pore minimizing primer but
for me I'm just going to use a hydrating
one because my skin's been extra dry
from all the traveling I've been doing
so do you whatever primer your skin
needs because all of our students
it I can't let that dry and kind of like
set into my skin before I jump right
into finale right into foundation so the
foundation I'm gonna be using today is
what I've talked about a lot this is to
conceal imperfect
from Milani and issues issues as a
foundation it's super full coverage and
I love the way it blends out I'm in
shade sub-1 burgers gross so we also
have foundation to our face in different
ways I don't really see that that part
matters what I like to do is like dot it
on it pretty much always have done it
like this and then I blend it out I'm
going to take this morphe white six
brush and I really like this brush to
blend out the full coverage foundation
the reason I don't have eyebrows on in
yet is because lately when I do my
foundation I was wipe my brow right off
and I'll be so pissed because I worked
so hard on jaws on my eyebrows and just
one self light and that suckers gone so
I've been filling in my eyebrows a
little bit later like after the cream
products have gone on this way my
eyebrows will not get sacrifice ah now
I'm going to take the soft matte
complete concealer from NARS it looks
like this this one is in a custard
medium one which is my favorite shade
you can mix your finger in there warm it
up or get a brush in there and really
warm up the product and they come
beneath the airtight little pot I
probably have you had this one for like
two months or so and it hasn't dried out
whatsoever so the packaging is nice I'm
going to apply this product with the
brush today that way I can get really
precise so what I'm going to do is just
apply to the dark circles circles
circles dark circles to really cover
those and then we're going to go ahead
and highlight a little bit of this goes
a long way as you can see I've dipped my
brush into a once and it just still
rolling with me the reason I didn't do
the big triangles under my eye it was
it's because I really like to blend this
out first I'm just going to use a damp
Beauty Blender and it really covers look
at that coverage I like to highlight and
contour with these so I'm going to show
you how I do that today they're very
comfortable so they don't feel too cakey
or heavy and they still kind of
lightweight but you get maximum coverage
with them and it was a natural looking
cover so when you don't look too cakey
with the make
makeup on put a high my undereye I'm
going to use a product I've been using
for years this is the radiant creamy
concealer from NARS and shade at custard
my favorite you get medium to full
coverage out this and it's really nice
and buildable and I like this because it
has like a hydrating formula to it so
it's not like really cracking and a dry
out your under-eye and be really Creasy
so this is the part where I'll take this
little friend right here and just
highlight away and now I'm going to take
my Beauty Blender and just blend that
right out you can also use a soft matte
creamy concealer to to prime your eyelid
or hide any veining or redness next time
and take this off matte complete
concealer this one's in at k keeo CAC a
Oh choco choco I think that's how you
say it this is dark number two and of
course on our contour my face with this
I love cream contouring I do it almost
every day once you have it down to a
science you do it really quickly so what
I'm going to do is start at kind of the
top of the ear line but I find it truly
important not to come down too far which
is a mistake has made several times in
the past and then it is one way too
close to your mouth so now I'm going to
snatch a little nosey
I to add some here which can kind of
give you an appearance is like a perfect
rounded chin and then naturally where
the sunlight hits your forehead you want
to go ahead and contour to get my
contour really precise into the beauty
blender I like to use a brush this is
d-57 9m brush from morphe if you
actually use this brush of powder or
cream Parata and as you can see I'm not
driving the product down because I want
it to kind of be specifically where I
place it so blended out cream contouring
is a area where you really want to take
your time don't rush it you know fans
don't create a mess that wasn't there
okay
but as you see these concealers like
just you know in a couple swipes go they
blend it I'm going to do this and
because my eyebrows are not going in I
can just go to town and really get that
product smooth out nicely without trying
to avoid my eyebrows do you guys love
this one end I'm trying to let y'all get
all up close and personal and know
what's going on for real with this lens
there's some forehead and now we're
going to do this little cheeky - mm-hmm
just match that little cheek oh she
stamped
whenever I put any type of cream product
on my face I will set it with a powder
to matter like if it's cream is getting
set with a powder that would think so
fluff around get greasy or move
throughout the day I'm going to be using
my color of eggs this is the perfect
setting powder right here so that looks
back right there mm-hmm so what I like
to do is get my beauty blender and tap
it into here yes I'm Beauty Blender is
dampened and no it really to me doesn't
make a difference if my Beauty Blender
is damp or not I like to go ahead and
bring it up the sides of the nose like
that to go ahead and clean up that area
make sure my nose looks really nice and
contoured if you put it in your smile
lines it will definitely will help with
the creasing but I don't really
recommend putting it this product on to
your contour you know because then
you're going to mess up all your hard
work
so also a cool trick I like to do if you
feel like you drug this down too low you
can let that set right there and you
won't believe what a beautiful leg
straight contour you'll get out of that
after that has set on the face for a
while you can just take any brush and
just blend it on off blend up all that
excess now that hit this morphe y9 brush
and go in with my Physicians Formula
this is herb butter bronzer and we could
touch up the contour like I said is how
I set down the cream I just go back in
with the powder
she really nicely set it just finishing
up I'm going to add some blush using the
9b pout from morphe I'm going to mix
these two shades together and just pop
it on to the apples this really isn't a
part of my actual foundation routine
blender showing you over I'm going to go
with our do drive from Oprah and use
this as a highlighter with my Y 14 brush
from morphe
so this is a very cool covers look like
I said in the title of the video this is
meant for like full full coverage it's
going to look great in pictures is
definitely the Instagram go and full
coverage makeup tutorial you don't see
dark circles and very stamped highlight
contours you don't fire give up brush
hair in my eye
whoo okay guys so that is it for this
video I hope it was helpful and really
getting down that really full makeup
look with it without looking too too
cakey but getting all the covers that
you want
thank you guys so much for being here
watching I love you all so you have an
absolutely amazing day and I would hit
you on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
