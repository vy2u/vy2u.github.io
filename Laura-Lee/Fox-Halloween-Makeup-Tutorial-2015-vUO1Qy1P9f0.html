of the dark you've never seen it look so
easy I got a river for a soul and baby
is gonna be this thoughts of oil not
your typical makeup tutorial I look so
weird talking to you right now I keep
looking in the viewfinder because I'm
like who is that over there I saw a
picture of a fox like a fox costume like
the headpiece and I was like you know
you're really cute I did thoughts make
up so I just had a picture of saw
sitting right here on my computer and I
just looked at and created this book I
hope you guys are excited however the
ears I just picked up at a local
Halloween store and they are not looking
like rabbit ears but they said Fox ears
but they're so big I'm like I just look
like a rabbit but you know we're gonna
pretend that with our foxier so you can
visualize fox ears above my head my cat
right here wants to attack the ears
because they became his cat toy as soon
as I bought them and I had to take home
way to put them on my head for this
tutorial I'm really excited I hope you
guys are excited see this look please
subscribe before you leave we're gonna
jump right in and turn ourselves into a
box wasn't what does the Fox say I don't
know
all right let's get start turning
ourselves into a fox I'm gonna go in
with this morphe concealer palette and
I'm gonna go in with the lightest shade
which is basically okay it's white
so this shades why I'm gonna go in I'm
gonna cover my whole jaw line including
my earlobes I'm just using a damp sponge
to do this with it just made it really
easy to apply I'm also gonna cover my
upper lip and my actual lips I'm using
concealer instead of a Halloween like
paint product just because it works so
much better on the skin then I'm gonna
go in with this little morphe powder
contour palette and use the white shade
to set everything you're definitely
gonna want to set this whenever you're
putting this much makeup on your face
because it's gonna smudge and smear feel
gross and sticky so I'm setting it just
makes it last longer to stay I'll go in
with the same morphe palette and I'm
gonna grab the orange earth shades and
I'm gonna do this right above where I
did the white on to the cheeks and just
kind of do like a c-shape around my
temples a little bit with the same
dampened sponge this tutorial is super
easy I promise guys so once I've done
that I will then just smooth it out a
little bit more and then I'm gonna go in
with this shades that are basically the
color of my skin you can use your
foundation at this part cuz we're just
gonna be covering at the top of the
forehead I mean I guess these shades are
a little bit lighter than my actual
foundation but it's just to even
everything out so I'm just gonna cover
down the nose in the forehead area
basically whatever's left including the
eyelids then I'm gonna grab this medium
shade you can use your foundation powder
if you want to out of this morphe
contour palette I'm gonna set everything
this just really helps it to last longer
and not to be gross and creepy and
sticky then I grab the warmest brown
shade I'm gonna run it down the nose
we're gonna create a fox nose so
basically taking this flat a little bit
of finer brush here I'm gonna start at
the brow bone and just run it right down
the nose like a straight line and I'm
just gonna curve it around the tip of
the nose then when I get it rabs some
more people actual liner and I'm gonna
cover the tip part up my nose giving us
a little Fox nose I'm using that same
brush that I used to draw the lines down
the nose which is like the Sigma flat
definer brush and I'm gonna cover the
tip of the nose
next I will draw a line straight down my
Cupid's bow where it touches the lips
and then I will outline just the top
parts of my lips and I'll draw a little
line up I'm trying to create the
illusion of a fox mouth foxes are so
sweet and cute I was googling pictures
in the film but that's besides the point
of this tutorial
anyways then I go ahead and draw a
little polka dots on the upper lip area
giving the illusion of whiskers you came
and make whiskers if you want to next is
eyebrows which this was the most fun
part to me I started off really small
with the eyebrows just kind of outlining
my natural brows and then I started
flicking it up a little bit to create
little hairs and then I got really crazy
with it and made really dramatic little
hairs and even brought the product
closer to my nose that way it gives it
more of an illusion of an animal this
part just really made the look to me and
I use the Anasazi brow pomade in dark
brown
next I'm gonna grab a little bit my eye
primer and plop this on to the lids like
how I said that flop it onto the lids of
some random anyways I'm gonna grab a
little bit of beaches and cream from
makeup geek and I'm gonna blend this
right into the crease this is just gonna
give us a softer look whenever we add
the black eyeshadow you don't have to do
this step especially if it's just a
Halloween costume but you know I'm gonna
go all out and then I'm gonna grab a
little bit of that morphe black gel
liner in that same flat brush I'm
actually gonna cover the eyelids with it
and that's gonna create little Fox
eyelid basically the black gel liner is
a base for the black eyeshadow we're
gonna step on top just to deepen it up
I'm gonna go in with corrupt which are
which is our black matte eyeshadow and
just gonna plop that on to the eyelids
and then I'm going to go in and line out
the eyes I'm not gonna touch the
waterline with this black liner because
I'm gonna go in with a lighter liner and
that point in the inner corner I make it
way more dramatic than what I did there
you'll see later anyways then I've
smoked that out a little bit of black
eye shadow as well as increased area and
what I put my waterline Sarah was the
Tarte interim liner it's just a nude
liner for the waterline then I'll pop on
a little bit of mascara and false lashes
obviously you don't have to do false
lashes if you don't want to I just added
on because it's just more fun for the
look especially if you're going out for
Halloween and want to wear some falsies
and basically we have completed the look
this was so much fun to create for you
