made me love each other in the first
place is because I call dirty love okay
barks I have this - I like I'm
definitely like that's my fault I will
say when it comes to makeup as once I
find something that I love
I don't wanna try anything else so guys
I'm not trying other concealers I'm like
it's not gonna be better than that
that's why it's so hard to do monthly

yeah same she's perfect she could do
anything and I'd still be like being so
sad yeah I like the x-men movies there's
my favorite weasels oh my gosh would I'm
a very big Marvel oh gosh but you took
me to see through and honestly I didn't
really
it's so fucking good I love to see
movies like me and John's favorite thing
is to see movies we love I mean hello
it's Chris Hemsworth there was need and
he cut his hair in this movie right yes
you did he was so fucking funny when you
show this I was like oh yeah I know I
felt it in my fucking basement now your
nether regions what else do you have a
dick a dick Laura the fucking thing was
I just an asshole oh just fucking flat
go you know your relationship makes more
sense the more you guys know you have to
watch okay let me think I love
everything okay
categories I love everything in rainbows
and smiles no for movies I have to have
a category it's really hard for me let's
do romance I love everything by Nancy
Meyers which is like father of the bride
okay holiday it's complicated
something's got to give like that new
movie with Anne Hathaway what's it
called
um come on come on come on with the
intern yeah like they're so calming it's
like sweet I love it so fucking funny I
think you would love it I think it's
great I love the movie safe haven with
Julianne Hough and Josh Jamal okay oh my
god Josh Duhamel Josh Duhamel hates my
funny bone me too it's my sex bone she
don't want Chad sad shit I'll try to get
her watch Brian you saw two days after
me but I'm actually not a big crier in
movies oh no once I start the scene it's
literally that movie like literally as
like change my mindset on the fucking
life I agree Oh gasps brow it's time for
me to do a little something I've been
working on the brows like a good 20 okay
I'm gonna start it so that there's that
there's that they don't have so much
brow yes look at that
you barely leave it you barely even need
to fill honestly no I do you just need
to feel to get like the powder dust off
I love to blend I live for blending
everything it so much shoot your dead
ass like your arm is tired oh no Joe I'm
not kidding
like my fingers will start to cramp I'm
just like just keep going this is what
it gets good yeah that's the one you
start to really see how do we meet no
Laura we met how was the first time that
we mean you met hold on you did come to
the party um the New York City Becca
shampoo party right that is the first
time the first time is but we didn't
even talk like having conversation oh
there are so many people there yeah
tell me the first time that we ever
actually talked actual conversation I
never had a time where I like met you I
was like oh this is Laura because there
was it was just like what's up Nicole
are there that's why I first met them oh
yes yes everybody was a better event see
everyone the biggest event back then
yeah I mean like it that's what everyone
met each other that's crazy
yeah hate like it's so weird to think
back like that much time you remember
the first time that I met you
yeah when he let me stalked my ass and
flew to Florida but he literally came
down to Florida and that to be metaphor
generate no joke which Adam mm-hmm and
we found love emails yeah we honestly it
was love at first sight instant
connection I look loving
I love getting to like to see other
people's as a audience like kill and
because everyone is such a different
audience people get so upset when like
certain people go onto their channel cuz
they're used to seeing a certain thing
wait I was like that's not like you're
like messing with goodbye one time I
heard like the best piece of advice it
actually came from my friend Jackie and
it's funny cuz she's someone you she's
not someone to give invites like she's
not like an advice giver like oh he not
she's not like she just kind of like
listens to you and like we'll be there
for you but she doesn't really give
advice yeah every time she opened up her
mouth that gave me advice and it changed
my world she told me she said not
everyone is gonna be your everything and
when she said that I was like oh my god
and she was like you just have to take
people for what they are and appreciate
them for the good in them but you're
expecting to be everything yeah and so I
think that I feel like I have ease up on
everyone like just in life and social
media everywhere cuz like maybe
someone's videos maybe they're the best
at blending but maybe they're not good
at other things yes oh well no the
greatest salt and appreciate their
bloody skills and be done yeah yeah you
know and it's like you don't have to
hate all their other like assets you
know just me and the thing too is like
I've come to realize like about like
because this is like I used to get to
that I used to fall exists of like I
would be upset when I wouldn't get I get
certain amount of views and I would be
like feeling some type of way when like
everyone else is doing is more
successful things than me it's like you
know what like in that moment when you
upload like people like want to hear
your energy and see how you do things
yeah don't it's not always like that do
they need someone else's energy at that
time exactly you know what I mean
like I really kind of like thinking
about that I was like you know what
that's so true like maybe the reason
they like a baby while watching because
they didn't want the energy at that time
I really want a different work or calm
energy or they wanted something more
intense like people feel like it would
make people like a lot nicer if everyone
would live by that and depreciated have
good in them yeah I agree anything if
that's what people want to expect too
much talk online they think that we're
gonna be there everything all the time
we're gonna fuck up and it's well when
people leave me comments they're like
Jacqueline you should be better than
this you should be a better role model
in this I might provide I never claimed
to be
we have claimed to be is new sometimes
we have a really bad day horse doctor I
say to I'm just kind of like honestly I
literally don't even fuck anymore like
you guys if you want that like great if
you don't do it yeah like I don't care
exactly I I personally love following
people who just keep it very real yeah
that's my favorite yeah like a real real
not like a fake real exactly I did it Oh
mean you did an interview real like you
know you guys never once said you're
real or fun she was like can we
interview people all the time they have
to say like what do you do yeah well I'm
a really fun person that's how you
describe you so this will tell us how
you're fun like how are you fine I'm
really funny
this was bronze all three coach yeah I
love it when you guys joke around about
your codes more serious than what it
actually yes people get so upset and
like in anyway but at the same time like
if you walk into a Nordstrom like
they're working like in the video
Department I know if I worked there you
work on 3% Commission yeah and they push
you shit they don't even like and
they've never used just because they
want to take on that paycheck when you
walk into a Nordstrom do you expect
people to be like just you know making
3% off of all these sales or do you
don't even use this product yeah bitch
at least we use it I like it and like
show you how to use it and showing you
why we like it yeah it's like that's
crazy to me because it's like it's a
it's legit the same thing but I think
the people's get really upset because
they there has been a lot of misuse but
you want to know a uzs industry I will
say but you don't know that I think is
super misused and I see it happen all
the time in the industry
I see people down a popular product and
it is a good product they down and say
it's bad when people do that when people
do that about your appellant I know
there was a lot that hurt me like that
way
your heart I was so sad crying crying to
Linda and Linda kept on me Jacqueline
your palette is incredible it's because
they actually haven't released yet once
the public gets it in their hands they
will she was right people bought it and
then once like the actual like actual
customers I mean one negative comment
about my palette consumer since its long
yeah
thank you Jesus no literally thank you
Jesus but that was scary there for a
minute and they don't realize that

much hard work and dedication I also
don't realize they're messing with the
