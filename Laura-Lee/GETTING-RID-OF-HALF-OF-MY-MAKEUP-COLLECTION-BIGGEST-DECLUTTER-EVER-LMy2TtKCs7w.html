the SUBSCRIBE song to do the damn thing

we're not dabbing anymore alright let's
jump right into the video just to show
you guys what we're gonna be working
with today this is my setup for makeup I
have to Alex nine drawers here some
acrylic containing some acrylic
containers from the Container Store that
go all along here I have five Alex five
drawer sets from Ikea and then on this
end I have one Alex nine drawer in
another acrylic container so as you can
see we have a lot to go through most of
the top part is drugstore sorry we're
backlit because my window but most of
this is drugstore makeup and then down
here is organized and we'll go through
and I'll show you but yeah it's time to
get rid of some makeup honey let's do it
where is a highlighter drawer so I'm
gonna go through
and yeah get rid of what I'm not using
here is what I got rid of out of the
first Shore a couple of these products I
just aren't using or they don't look
good on me and then this one do or one
over here just it's so beautiful but I
have two of them so god I'll need to
pretty good our next drawers
highlighters again and this short is a
little bit more cluttered and definitely
a lot of these have to go girlfriend so
I'm gonna go through monster again one
of these
oh we are getting rid of oh my gosh look
at all these girls they just don't work
for me or again I'm not using them and I
know you may be thinking girl you are
Christ but honey I got a lot left and
this Shore alone we just got rid of
twenty highlighters that's right I said
twenty cheeks that won't be blinging the
Jordan did look like poopoo caca but now
it is so organized and there's only a
couple couple girls what and what world
am i living only a few highlighters and
they don't go all the way to the back
they stop right here next door honey I
do but it's at the Kylie and then some
of the back of one sheets aren't great
for me I had about 30 purple
highlighters come in at once so girl I
don't need any more of those the
supposed to be real and I'm not wearing
them and then over at our drawer it
looks about a hundred million times
better what is this in the back and you
can see this oh we like over girl cuz we
got a code just getting my actual our
next short here we have bronzers and
it's a mess and probably a lot of these
don't work for me
right in this case we get rid of 12
bronzers from fighter you rock the bomb
Bobby Brown Lyla B and then some ciaté
this is our drawer now I think it looks
so much better
hey what is next oh god it's more
bronzer and I know what you're thinking
they don't look any different but it
does because look at this we go to 13
bronzers I had a lot of old two-faced
ones they need it to go cuz that the new
packaging and like this darker one just
doesn't work for me
so shall we move on next sure oh girl is
the liquid highlight I'm about to have a
field day in this bitch good honey I got
rid of 23 or 23 yeah let's pick a random
highlighters liquid highlighters and we
still have a ton but there's a lot of
space to add more here's some of what
I'm just noting I don't like going I'm
just not grabbing for them and so it's
time to let them go a little bit maybe
watch this joke on me seasick sure is
full of my hopes and dreams and in the
next or is face powders which I think
you never have enough of these guys here
we go
all right so we ended up with all eight
Laura Mercier at powders as well as some
of the other good goods like the cover
FX the senti the welder the toothpaste
girl let's go step I'll be busy talking
one drawer there's a lot of talent honey
anyways I'm getting rid of the following
that cover effects this in my shade just
these little bad boys that they got the
flashback Mary to them and I'm not about
it oh my god how did we get here with
freaking setting spray some we have like
so many duplicates of and stuff that
it's just like in ten years I can't use
all this girl only got one face you know
what I'm saying one face okay
it's thanks pretty store is a little
full still but we did get rid of ten
different setting sprays because some
are old some are glittery and sometimes
need to go home look at this one first
dollar these however are my little
soldiers they're gonna stay we have Mac
lamb glow iconic London
oh my morphe preppin set my Smashbox and
then ya good to face Mel C yes next
because I'm too lazy to get back up and
go all the way up there we're gonna
start with the fudge oh god here we go
you guys know I did some work on this
drawer there are a couple that have like
one or two of each of bran but I still
got rid of a bunch and yeah I'll
probably continue to get rid of more how
many what's the golden number here 22
honey I heard of 22 foundations and this
is not my only foundation door so hold
on to your panties since we still have
more to show to you with
gosh you guys remember what this joy
looked like about 15 minutes ago girl it
looks better now we ended up getting rid
of 17 foundations majority of them
wasn't my shade and I just haven't had
time to like go through and figure out
which one's work for me still so are not
sure so we have more foundations most
these your foundation is sticks and
makeup over and O's in here so shall we
okay let's do it have a problem yes I do
and I'm not planning on fixing it with
my hourglass you can't take it from me
but we still got rid of 19 different
stick foundations in this drawer
somebody likes stick contoured sticks
but still girl sorry my fate hour left
there and I just want you to know that
that is not my shade and that's the only
reason she's leaving the family okay and
then we had a couple powders we got rid
of next is for contour this is iris get
rid of I did a video getting rid of this
and it's in my drawer so I'm just
sketching here we go
remember when color crackers was a thing
for like a month and then there Rose
like oh no they're for people actually
need them not for the general public
I'm sorry it's getting dark but this is
our most successful tour so far I've
gotten rid of 26 items lots of BB creams
that are just old and then I'm not using
anymore and then the color correcting
thing girl we're done with it I kept a
couple of the peach directors favourite
drawers the word that haunts us all on
this channel concealer there's a pattern
of a problem there's a lot of the same
product girl would I ever get rid of any
of these other and now they're spread
out so it may not look like I did but I
got rid of 37 highlighters 37 guys
majority of them was in my shade I
didn't have time to go through and pick
which ones on my shade but now we know
so a little bit from every brand went
out even tart so this looks like it is
eyeshadow primers as well as old school
YouTube video and I kind of loved it but
like Princeton we have three of the same
primer go away goodbye in this door and
I'm like I'm pretty sure this mini is
from like the 80s so I'm gonna go ahead
and let her go so many primers already
went through these little pot concealers
and got rid of a ton of have so much
space in this drawer that I didn't have
before
and basically I have some of my primers
I got two more drawers of primers that
hang tight this was just overflow and
we'll probably be able to ship the
overflow up I have some pot concealers
and
some eyeshadow primers in this drawer
now I ended up getting rid of a 20 sorry
it's shadowy 27 I pry MERS and face
primers and then some concealers none of
these are my shade I don't know what I
was thinking and yeah a lot of these are
expired yeah now we're getting into
facial primers and a lot to go through
so so I ended up combining the doors as
the top one was almost empty and these
are a lot of hydrating primers and some
lux primers a little bit tea in there
and then this one is just the overflow a
lot of another amazing primers but
they're just in the overflow jewelr do I
need to get rid of more primers yes am I
going to absolutely not because I did
get rid of 21 primers 21 I had
duplicates of all these so I don't need
two of each some are old pointing to you
sister you're looking a little old there
so we're on the lash or for the Alison
nine system and we have moisturizer
which let's be real this parts probably
boring to most of you guys but I do plan
to get rid of quite a few of these that
I'm just I use it almost like hot you're
doing up here
so this is the moisturizer drawer we did
limit it down of a few body oils and I
have some BB cream in there is what we
got rid of I got rid of some duplicate
things of course and then the rest of
knowledge is saying using so it's gots
to go how many items
let's count 16 things which is not bad
at all
thank about day two of me doing this
guys and now we are on to the five
drawers so these first five doors are
all lip products so I'm gonna do all
those lip products at once they are
organized by Apple bit and if you can
see we just had the brands on each Shore
and the lettering and so obviously can
never use this mate lip product in my
life so I'm gonna do the first five
drawers what we pull out so a lot of
these I'm actually not gonna get rid of
I'm gonna continue hoarding on stage
because like I like these a lot like I
like the colors now there are because
there's like I know for a fact that I
won't wear and actually I'm gonna go and
get rid of Sunday's know what I've had
this neutral lipstick from Calvin Dean
for about 20 years and I don't plan on
getting rid of it because it's like it
keepsake and this one too I bought these
a long time ago
sharing with you guys the next five
jours we just have they're not
thoughtful but the way you can see what
we just have more lippies in here oh my
gosh look at all these Mac with these
can I get rid of some of these colors
here we go the piles getting pretty big
of what we're getting rid of
okay I'm gonna let you count those okay
I'm gonna count every time say I'm not
gonna do that wow this is this is liquid
lipsticks lip glosses lipsticks that I
am getting rid of that I don't want
anymore than literally every brand in
here lots of high-end brands I'm not
wearing these colors and I did keep a
lot of nudes but the thing is like I
wear more nudes and like if I have
already like a purple lip gloss I don't
need three of them because I probably
wear purple lip gloss once a year so I
got rid of a lot of stuff like that oh
my gosh and the doors actually my Mac I
didn't get rid of a lot since my staple
shades but the other drawers like we
have so much more space
anything idea of course goodbye because
I don't want to go to waste a lot of my
Pat McGrath I kept got rid of a lot of
NARS I didn't get rid of a lot out of
this store because honestly I haven't
had time to play with all of my Sephora
Smashbox and some of my favorite liquid
lipsticks so I'm gonna keep those I got
rid of a ton of tart and a ton of Too
Faced liquid lipsticks and lip stick
YSL I just organized it got rid of all
loads of urban decay that I just was not
using and now we're about to move on to
eyeshadow which is gonna get really fun
done all of these drawers and now this
drawer is single eyeshadows and then
these are I showed a palette so this
part I think is a really fun we're gonna
go through and get rid of lots of
eyeshadow oh god I'm so sorry Kylie I
just bought you on the head here we go
oh my god
clean out these drawers already I know
it still looks full but I promise a
little stuff you guys are gonna see it
in just a second we have our abh drawer
coloured raine we have mac cosmetics and
mark Jacobson this Shore Natasha didn't
illness so makeup forever and in our
mortgage we're actually limited it down
so we only you have eighty two morphe
palette so wow bar look at you go bro
and now we have the last bit of
eyeshadow drawers which there's still a
lot to go through and obviously we're
gonna nip and tuck it so there's some
eyeshadows back here and in the front
there are some contour kit so this is a
little bit of a mixture and then this is
Beauty Blender heaven they're also a lot
dirty ones but I'm not gonna get rid of
any of these because you can never have
too many Beauty blenders and don't let
anyone ever tell you different
morphe makes the new contour and
highlight palette l8l and ail
l8 Al and 8h palette so I'm gonna let
these and go I'm so sorry but this is a
good dumb palette and this is one of the
best things that ever made so it's
amazing
maybe we'll bring it back one day when
you have it all the eyeshadows I'm
getting rid of oh my gosh
we have tart Fiat a lot of singles it I
just like the morphe palette some let
those go some other stuff I
Wow look at that guy's it's so good like
my doors now are like have so much space
for new makeup to come in they already K
into vision we're still a full booth I
love a lot of the palettes but there's
space for more now and look at my
contour palette like drawer so good and
then this is the tarte and smashbox
store so much more space now it's not
amazing so we have this alex night door
to go through now what who is this man
what are you doing so the first thing in
these eyelets nine drawers are blush
blush and palette I have this much blush
long ago no I wear blush maybe twice out
of the week palette okay I am going to
go ahead and start with this blush
drawer I think it's time to let a lot of
these blushes go
from the blush drawer I am getting rid
of all these and as a grand total it is
38 blushes like this is a whole drawer
in itself I did move all my own morphe
brushes down here because I had more
space for them those are the little trio
sets and then here is what my blush
sources right now it's just it's cool as
before and yeah I feel great at that but
some high tech 38 blushes out of drawer
I don't know hot close
this small amount of highlighter
palettes I'm getting rid of really shows
you my issue and how much I love
highlighters and highlighter palettes
but these are the ones these are cream
from ziwei I'm just not using this one
broke and then these I've had since
December and I'm not using them so it's
time to let it go and this was a
duplicate so goodbye palettes see you
later pal adjourn now it looks like this
now I have so much room for a hundred
new up highlighter palettes I mean
wouldn't it be so sickening I'm Laura
Lee Los Angeles did a highlighter
palette now we're gonna do this blush
palette drawer and then I will get
mascara girl I know I'm gonna go in hard
with these mascaras hard hard

favorite brands but like there's just a
couple pimp in there that aren't my
style I did keep a lot here are toys
that looks so good I got my Lily lashes
lashes lashes and some blues back there
the next thing is like this humongous
thing and I'm gonna clean it out all in
one and show you guys the end result

craziest thing
give you guys a quick rundown I got rid
of blush bronzer setting sprays it's an
additional pounds back there foundation
drawer we have some empty spots now this
was back to the top powders
whenever I have a drawer full like I
