video is going to be a bold makeup look
it's got dark sultry eyes and even a
dark lip I typically always pair a
neutral lip whenever I do more bold eye
shadow and I did cool tones so yeah all
my cool tone makeup lovers out there
this video is for you and if you're just
not really up for cool tones just hang
in there because I really love the way
this look came out okay in this tutorial
I use the NARS and filtered cheek
palettes these are so beautiful they are
absolutely amazing for every single skin
tone out there this is the unfiltered
one palette and it has great warm tones
in it and then this is the unfiltered 2
palette which has more cooler tones in
it which is also very beautiful and I
use this little friend right here a lot
in this tutorial it's one of my favorite
shades out of the palette so yeah these
palettes are really gorgeous for this
look and I can't wait for you guys to
see me use them girl I got my green
contacts in today which means this is
Abel Laura I'm just kidding to always
say it's my alter ego though so it's
like the sassy or Laura whenever I have
my brown eyes is the sweet Laura also be
sure to subscribe to my channel before
you leave today we're going to go ahead
and jump right in and get started and I
hope you guys enjoyed the video for
starters I am going to prime my skin as
usual I'm going to be using the G way
this is a moisturizing primer I'm just
gonna it's like a little squeezy tube
and I am just gluing it to a shorter
under skin wintertime comes
and my skin it gets dry but then if I
put too much moisture on it my pores get
clogged so it's like super annoying time
of year for me with my skin it tries to
play me you know I don't really let it
but it tries to moving right along for a
foundation I'm going to be using it the
Maybelline Dream cushion foundation I've
used this for three days in a row and
I've been loving it so I'm going to use
the SAT to whoop kabuki brush just to
apply this all over my face I'm in shade
true beige with this foundation I try to
meet him
beige and it was an epic fail I have
that video posted where I review this
foundation if you want to see it now for
concealer I'm going to take my NARS
concealer in shade custard and just
apply this to highlight we're going to
go ahead and do the face makeup I do
that sometimes oh it's my hyuh
not my height I'm going to take that 79
kabuki and just blend all this out I'm
going to take the new cover effect
setting powder and just sit all this
maked
next for my contour highlight and blush
I'm going to be playing with the NARS
unfiltered 1 &amp;amp; 2 palette and I'm going
to be using a few different shades for
blush I'm going to mix these two shades
together the shades are called
watch me and me first I'm going to mix
these two together and apply them at the
blush going to take my f40 brush from
Sigma and look how much pigmentation you
get I'm just going to apply this to the
cheek it's so pretty
I'm going to take my art 14 brush from
morphe then I'm going to tap in to take
over which is a little more of a bronzey
color these palettes have a mixture of
shimmers and mattes
and um so with that being said it's
really easy to use these in a variety of
ways you can even use it as like an eye
shadow so definitely get your money's
worth out of the palettes
I'm going to take the end filter to
palette and I'm going to take conquests
we're highlighting which is a really
beautiful Oh such a pretty highlighting
shade and it has such a pretty shine to
it
gorgey can even add a little bit of the
highlight to the forehead to really get
the glow going now we're going to move
on to working on the eyes I'm going to
use these little shadows shield
eyeshadow since we're going to be
working with more of a bold colors I'm
only gonna peel the sticky off right
here which these are really gentle and
they're made for under the eye this
isn't weird at all
I'm going to grab the morphe 35c palette
this is a cool tone palette I'm going to
use cool tones because I never show cool
tones any love on my channel I rarely
use them and I my past two makeup looks
have been a little bit soft and I just
haven't been very dramatic so I want to
add a little bit of a deeper colors
there are cool tone to the eyes I'm
going to take this cool Toby brown color
as my transition shade with the e-40
brush from Sigma
next I'm going to mix these two purpley
shades together and blend them in the
crease because I want this to remain a
really cool tone deeper look with almost
like a very slight hint of purple
peeking through so we're just going to
apply that right into the crease as well
I'm going to take this deeper brown
color and I'm just going to pop that in
the crease that way the darkest color
we're about to use kind of close with
everything now I'm going to take this
really pretty shimmery brown color from
colour-pop it's called moaning and I'm
just gonna swap my finger whoo
super pigmented probably get a little
too much on my finger and I'm going to
just pop it onto the lid
there is miss smooth out and the
craziness oh hush edges what is that /
dia ah and then we have a really sharp
unblended edge but don't worry I'm gonna
go touch that up in just a second I love
how dark and seductive the eyes are I'm
now going to take this little flat brush
and take those two purple colors we used
and just really get up in that lower
lashline girl we're gonna get up in
there and do some work I'm gonna take
little baby strokes HQ to really blend
that out if you do a dark smoky eye
don't neglect that lower lashline honey
and then I'm gonna soften up this crazy
edge cuz I should have better stop
playing me oh because that edge doll oh
and I'm going to connect them right
there in that corner there because you
want it to be like nice and like smoked
out all the way around well that's what
I'm going for here anyway just be sure
and take your time at this parks it can
be a little bit meticulous trying to get
like this little corner and all softened
out and I tell you this because it's
taking me a long time to do it I'm going
to take an F 30 pencil brush and take
the pretty highlight shade and I'm going
to pop it in that in our corner to
really open the eyes and give them that
glow next I'm going to pop on a little
bit of my Maybelline this is the push-up
angel mascara and it has kind of a weird
one on it but
I've really been enjoying this mascara
I'm actually going to take this pretty
high light shade and apply it to my brow
bone as well because I'm in love with it
all right guys I added some lashes from
icon lashes these are called jealous and
they Purdy they're so pretty in drama
which you know I live if you aren't
comfortable wearing false lashes simply
Lilly and Melanie simply leave them off
and just add some mascara to your lashes
and I'm sure look will be just as V
Vavoom and you'll have comfortable eyes
unlike me so last but certainly not
least I am going to add I think I want
to add this lip color this is called
chocolate wasted it's from dose of
colors and it's just our deep chocolatey
lip color let's see if I like it though
and this is the finished look thank you
guys so much for watching by the way
ended up loving the brown with the dark
eyes I don't really always do a neutral
with the dark eyes the guys we are going
to make it bolder so yeah this is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed the
