gonna do the hair I'm gonna be using the
t3 world trio it comes with a curling
iron base as well as three
interchangeable ones whenever you
purchase the world trio with the promo
code you will get the 1 inch and the 1
point 2 5 inch barrels for free so
amazing deals which will be down in the
description box below for today's video
I've decided to snap on the tousled
waves wand this is gonna help us get a
little nice tousle waves throughout our
hair and I'm gonna show you how I use it
first I mean look at my frizzy frizzy
hair I'm just gonna wrap the hair around
the one like I normally do taking very
small pieces of hair some pieces I'm
gonna wrap around like a ribbon and so
I'm gonna twist around this is gonna
crown and create a messy fro for me and
absolutely love the way it turns out you
will see in the end just to give you
guys some info on T 3 it has tourmaline
ceramic technology which creates shiny
frizz-free curls it also has a single
pass technology which means the barrel
heats the same from the top to the
bottom so it's the same amount of heat
throughout the barrel which means you
get a longer-lasting curl which I always
had at the end of the day whenever my
curls are droopy and they're almost out
of my hair but with this curler your
curls will not do that so I absolutely
let that about it but basically as you
can see with the curler I'm just doing
the same thing throughout my hair and
pretty much this is the final look I
love the way it turned out and I hope
you do too
and now we're gonna move on to the
makeup
it makes me wanna scream out loud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
