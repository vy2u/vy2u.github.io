guys what's up and welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be a much
requested video you guys wanted me to do
a look
but another look like a no makeup makeup
look and I've done these a long time ago
in the past and I want to do it again
I'm excited for it this is a really
beautiful look to look natural but ya
have a little bit of coverage very glowy
very dewy beautiful fresh face serving
looks but without all the glam and I've
kind of been into a lighter glam lately
I don't know how long that will last
but I've kind of an into like this
softer glam so I'm excited to do the
video I'm like yes this is right up my
alley and what I've been working on
lately so hey also I will be using the
wilder in this video I've partnered off
the air and I'll be yeah putting a
little bit of this on this video you
guys are familiar with it I've already
used it on my channel and I've been
loving it so also if you haven't already
girls and boys be sure and go to my
back-to-school make it tutorial because
in that video I have a huge
back-to-school giveaway and I'm going to
be giving away Matt Busby's by dre gift
cards makeup school supplies the whole
shebang super easy to enter just go to
that video and I'll have it linked down
below so without further ado do be sure
and subscribe for more song oh yeah
these I always think it a little
differently but was the same beat I like
it let's go ahead and jump right into
the video news
I know ahead and let you know we will be
doing a lot of skin prepping in this
video so to start out I like to use this
Tasha dewy skin miss I've been using it
for a long time and it is the greatest
dewy skin setting spray ever so you can
prep your skin with it you can set your
skin with it you can use in a couple
different ways today we are going to go
ahead and prep our skin with it going to
do a couple squirts like 20 squirts and
now I won't be eating it I'm going to
take a dampened Beauty Blender and you
guys know that whenever I like to put on
any type of spray as I do push it in
with a Beauty Blender it's just the way
I do makeup I want to look really glowy
now as far as primer I'm going to be
using the alarm RCA at foundation primer
and radiance this one actually gives a
beautiful glow and it's a little bit
hydrating so it leaves your skin looking
fresh and glowy throughout the day you
can see almost has like a champagne e
color to it i squirted it out way too
much squirt it out enough for like 10
faces but that's okay
so I actually going to rub this primer
all over the face I don't even know what
that is we're going to pretend like that
wasn't there I wrote some on the photo
head you can tell already my skin's
looking really fresh and dewy just
starting out so next up we're going to
go ahead and go in with a little bit of
foundation I've been really enjoying
this one this is the infallible pro glow
by L'Oreal I am in shade I can never
remember 205 I can never remember it off
the top of my head I just can't do it he
is I'm not going to use that much of
this I'm just going to use a little bit
to add a little bit of a color and just
a tiny bit of coverage because we want
to like we really aren't wearing mica we
trying to fool people out there and of
course I want to be using my y6 brush
from morphe I'm going to see when we
know that this guy will be back in stock
is out of stock and I know we're angry
about it
come let's talk okay here I go so I'm
just going to stipple this you see how
like gloomy and and then this foundation
it blends so easy and looks really
natural because it's dewy do you see how
it doesn't look like an cakey I really
like it and brush
once it L so nicely I'm like obsessed
with that look yet side we're going to
ask them over here and it adds just a
little bit of coverage but it's like
secretive coverage because you can't
really tell that I have on like looking
at the bottom of my face you can't
really tell that I have on much makeup
and that's all the foundation that I'm
going to use today now for concealer I
have to conceal this is just like sunken
in in darkness like a valley of death in
my eyes and we have to do something
about that okay I'm going to be using it
the Becca this is their concealer it's
the aqua luminous perfecting concealer
you don't see me use this product a lot
because it is super lightweight it's not
full coverage and it's a little bit more
natural and typically girls I want to
full of coverage concealer I can get on
my hands but not for today because that
would be a dead giveaway girl she's got
a fake time so we're going to be using
this one it's just so much more natural
by the way I'm using shade it fair and
just a little right there if you have a
skin color concealer and you have just a
couple blemishes or whatever you want to
put on your face you can now go in and
kind of just add that to your look in
those specific areas that way you still
get the makeup make it a little a little
but no makeup makeup look so you still
get the no makeup makeup a look but you
get some coverage so here we go we're
just going to blend this out with a
dampened Beauty Blender going back and
forth you guys know I like to stipple
back and forth it's just the name of the
game for me if you can see it just you
can still see my freckling a little bit
and it's kind of Loony so it's a bit
natural but with just a little bit of
coverage so it normally offer a little
coverage to more coverage than that but
not today because we want expression
look afresh we want to keep our look you
know I cannot talk today how is she even
on YouTube I don't even know I want to
keep my look really glowy and dewy and
natural like is that so we're still
glowy we're still doing but yet we have
on a foundation and concealer and a
primer and all that jazz moving right
along I'm going to go ahead and bronze
it out by adding a little bit of cream
contour using Mac's quick trick stick
this one is semi-sweet to have a couple
different shades and I love this product
or cream contour with
so I'm not going to go in and like do a
full sculpture look I'm just trying to
add a little bit of blondeness to this
look so we bring back our natural
shadows of our face so I'm just going to
hit I mean just a touch and then we'll
just do oh oh
mm and that's it I'm going to take a
damp Beauty Blender and start to really
softly blend that out and you'll see
that it really doesn't make that big of
a difference it just barely adds a
little bit of dimension to the face
until the Beauty Blender is dampening
these baby hairs it's okay though I
don't mind it you know something's going
to get them under control something so
I'm just going to dab it now this
product also blends out really easily so
I love that about it so if you can tell
we have just a little bit more structure
to the face and now I'm going to blow it
up today I'm going to using some of on
especially Beverly Hills liquid gloves
as a new highlighter just came out and
I'm using the shade Perla I tested this
out in my review of some of her newer
products and I really enjoyed this frog
DUP so I'm going to squirts them on the
back of my hand take my damp in at
Beauty Blender which is now loaded with
it
and you can see my freckling steel which
I think kind of gets away that I'm not
really wearing that much makeup or any
makeup maybe I don't know and I'm going
to actually take this and curl it all
around the temple area to get that
natural glow can you even hit a little
bit like right in there oh so pretty
gonna go just a little bit on the nosey
Posie keep it's go chin if you get
really only into these areas you can
avoid the highlight in those areas so I
feel really doing almost my skin looks
like more wet and shiny than it does
more foundation II and makeup II so what
you can do now but those reality of this
situation is this makeup will not stay
as it's not set it's just so much cream
product on my face so I'm going to go
ahead and hit it with the wowser I'm
going to be using the router because
is not a baking powder it's not really
heavy to set makeup and it's not to cook
and all that snazzy stuff it's more just
like a really light natural product it
gives you more of a real skin look than
a powdery look you can mattify your skin
but at the same time it let your skin
breathe I'm going to use the glassy
airbrush to go with it and you just tap
some on now this probably won't flash
back on you so you don't have to worry
about that it comes in light medium dark
deep and rich three shades I'm using
light medium and I'm going to hit this
area where the pores look a little
larger and we've got to set the
under-eye with it so I'm just going to
pop a little on that under eye and then
on dad before head where I get Olie
really badly right there
for my eyebrows we're going to have to
make them a little bit more natural so
I'm going to comb through them with my
precisely my brow pencil and instead of
shade 4 I'm going to use shade 3 which
is a softer color and a little bit more
natural for me I'm not going to do the
bowl fill in brow I'm only gonna fill in
the sparse areas which my brows in light
years from the time that I started on
YouTube till now like compared to how
many hairs I had I just wanted to scream
looking at my old videos like oh now I
have so many brow hairs that I didn't
have before and I'm really excited about
those hairs I just want to know why if
you pluck one brow hair and may never
come back but if you shave your leg hair
off or pluck it out or wax it out it's
going to come back every single time
what why can't I browse through this
doing soft butter like strokes not
putting nearly as much pressure on it
flicking it up for hair like strokes
bullying it so shockingly enough I'm not
going to put anything on my eyelid I did
whenever I was blending out the cream
highlight I did like tap the brow bone
an area kind of like that I do have a
little bit of redness on my eyes right
through the crease area it is a little
red I'm still going to leave it alone
because I think that if you add
concealer on top of that or heavy covers
it's a dead giveaway that I don't allow
makeup and for my lashes I'm not going
to add false lashes and I'm just going
to curl my lashes and I think it opens
up the eyes and make them look a little
bit flirty a little bit fluttery and
open whenever you just simply curl your
lashes it can make a world of difference
she's in this little house of lashes
lash curler and now I'm just going to
split through these little lashes okay
for a lip I'm not really going to do
much at all of course I present this
whole look I'm just going to add a very
natural obviously you can leave your
lips alone if you want to because if you
can see my lips are naturally pink but I
was going to add some Mantha by buxom
this is just a gloss it also has a
plumping agent in it just nice and just
shines on up as you can see it's kind of
a transparent gloss I don't want my lips
to
this is the final look I have on
foundation concealer can contour I have
on setting powder and cream highlight
and I feel like the look looks like I
have a little something on but not
really any makeup and actually I want a
lot of makeup and I think this is a
really great way to do it I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I hope it
was helpful in showing you guys how to
get this look it's also a really great
quick look for school or work or if you
just want to go out to the beach or have
a day on the Sun maybe add a little
sunscreen in the mix but I think it's
just an all-around great look thank you
guys for watching be sure and subscribe
bye Dan before you leave I love you guys
so much and I will see you all in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
