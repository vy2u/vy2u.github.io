introduce myself in this video which I
normally don't do
I am larlie I post three videos a week
and Wednesday Saturday Sunday normally
so welcome to my channel we also sing in
like a lot of weird noises on this
channel today's video is going to be a
life update video I did this a while
back and you guys really enjoy getting
to know me a little bit better and like
hearing what's going on in my life and I
actually have a lot coming up and a lot
going on that I want to announce to you
guys in this video so I thought it was
time to make an updated life chat video
I will also be getting ready in this
video but I won't be talking to to too
much about the makeup more so about
what's going on in my life answering
some of your questions it's not really a
Q&amp;amp;A just more me chatting with you guys
but if you want to know about the
products that I use in today's video be
sure and check the description box group
I linked in list everything down below
we got a beanie we got a baby oh oh he's
so big hey man hey man yeah yeah the
puppy that we are babysitting he's not
mine hey kid - man yeah yeah oh my boy
no big - baby you whoa that's one heck
of a puppy now I'm gonna be really red
for this video on my neck area like any
animal here makes me red and kind of
wealthy but I love animals so much I
don't care well that was quite the intro
huh don't put your handle oh yeah and
let's jump right into the video
oh we don't have it on this primer I
just recently recently recently tried
this out and I adore it this is super
solid a unicorn essence primer I need to
wash my hands girl so what I've been
doing is putting like a couple drops on
my face and then blending it on and I'm
going to take a Wi-Fi and just massage
it
anin oh it smells so good - it just
moisturizes the skin honestly so we were
babysitting that little baby bulldog and
he's the sweetest his name is Ziggy and
I just think he's so cute
yo she loved him but he's like a dog so
you know he's like jumpy and stuff and
she kind of backed up from that but she
loves him she stays by side Lou my black
cat is scared of anything that breathes
walks moves blinked at him so of course
the dog has never seen Lou because Lou
likes senses him coming goes and hides
under the bed so he actually stays at
his owners house during the day and like
we bring them in and you know spend some
time with them so he's not home alone
all day because one of the owners is
traveling right now and then we also
take them go poopoo and titi outside so
we're learning how to be dog parents hi
once it's all really bad in the future
I'm more of a cat lady than a dog person
but got to give the hubby what he wants
so one day we will be getting a doggy
for him here's a life update my husband
died his hair blue come on
come on it's not styled right now but
there it is he did this this was not
much everybody blames me for this
everybody's like Laura made you dye your
hair blue I didn't did I know you did it
I did it
this is 100% him I even really know he
was doing it he just told me not on me
people even his mom and dad really what
a bar do yeah I do this morning silver
kinda neck yeah I think I can do that
hmm and then back to brown what'd you
guys think
next up I'm going to add some foundation
I'm using the Laura Mercier flawless
fusion ultra wear foundation I'm mixing
shades 4 in 1 &amp;amp; 3 c1 together foundation
was sent to me and neither shades are my
shade ones way too light ones way too
dark what if I mix them together it's
literally the perfect foundation shade
so I'm like did they plan that all right
life update I am working out guys and
let's talk about this a little bit
because you're like well no one cares I
get it but I've never really worked out
my life I'm never really haven't gym
membership like a number I don't even
know how to work out so I have a
personal trainer who's helping me out
and basically I've already can tell a
difference in my body I am improving my
eating as well I'm not like 100% dieting
which my trainer
she's such a realistic trainer so that's
why I like her a lot because you know
she's not like oh you got to change
everything overnight and be a perfect
eater and a perfect worker out or and
all this me and Manny are actually both
working
and trying to support a healthier
lifestyle we both you know pretty bad
eaters so we're just taking baby steps
and we're working on our eating
decisions trying to get wipeouts then
quite a journey
I've eaten bad my whole life pretty much
and I just have a really fast metabolism
which is what people would call the luck
of the draw
I'm going to take this new color
corrector by brightening corrector by
benefit if any of you guys I have some
healthy I don't eat fish I don't eat
seafood periods if you guys have besides
that any healthy snack options dinner
options food options I'm trying to eat a
lot more meat to to get some protein in
this body because she she needs protein
trying to get stronger to also we have
found I'm a very weak individual
unfortunately and I'm trying to like
build muscle and just be healthier
altogether I've noticed a difference in
my body like the bloating has gone down
drastically so my stomach looks flatter
I don't really think it's because I
might lost so much weight which my
trainer was like you're going to build
so much muscle don't pay attention to
the scale that much because muscle
weighs more than fat and so you lose fat
automatically by building the muscle you
know your body will look different but
don't pay so much attention to the scale
because a lot going on in this body and
just let you know I am sore every day of
my life like I'm just used to being sore
now my arms are sore my abs are sore
mastis or my legs are sore everything on
this door even my shoulder blades are
sore from working out and then once I am
NOT sorry I go and get really sore again
so it is part of my life now this is the
NYX HD concealer and I love it to spritz
this new Beauty Blender and it's kind of
cool it's like marble pink marble put
some prep and set I'm going to blend
that out so that's been like something
I'm focusing on it takes a lot of time
on like day and that's the reason I
haven't worked out in the past and like
spent time on my body but I highly
recommend you guys invest in your soul
you know it doesn't have to be a workout
way I can just be like and taking baby
steps like eating one healthy meal out
of the week if you always eat bag like I
was doing or just like getting rid of
the french fries and eat the
cheeseburger but something healthier
than the fries with it like making baby
steps and just investing in yourself any
way that you possibly can
I recommend that it doesn't even have to
be
with help from food you know it could be
taking time to really study for that
test or make sure you're on time for
work that day whenever you're normally
late those little baby things investing
yourself when they start your day out
better and two they make you feel better
as a human being they make your
conscience clear just make you feel all
around mentally better and depending on
what you're doing you can make you feel
physically better as well so I really
encourage that guys I'm going to take a
little bit of the Born This Way at
setting powder and I'm going to go ahead
and set the under-eye so also you guys
know I'm coming out with Murch I hope
for it to be out towards the end of July
I'm working so hard day and night on
quite a few things by myself not in
collaboration with anyone and it is
taking all that I've got and you know I
can do it it's just like a lot of
sleepless nights a lot of work work work
think you guys don't see because I
haven't really told you guys about a lot
that I'm working on so you guys like
don't know you just see me on snapchat
sitting in my bed or I know it's like
hard to visualize like what I'm doing
cuz you guys don't know but in today's
video I did want to talk to you guys a
little bit about some of the things that
I've been working on and I am excited is
not a good enough word to whenever I say
I'm excited about it just know I am just
exploding about I'm also something
really nervous about but I'm excited
it's gonna swipe away that excess powder
I'm going to go ahead and add a little
bit of this true blend bronzer from Cup
and this is the M 105 bronzer brush okay

butterflies in my stomach right now

like lol lol oh I have been working on
this for a very long time and of course

first products is going to live

piece of my energy and my being in I
don't know why I don't know
coming out with a makeup line sounds
like something that's easy to do I don't
think it even sounds like something easy
to do but if it does just know it ain't
easy if it's done right it could be
easier but if you do things right and
perfect and great it's a really hard
thing to do and still working is so
friggin hard and so happy about a
product that I'm coming out with that I
worked on for so long
oh and it had me perfect and that is the
hard part about it how to be absolutely
perfect and I frickin busting my ass to
make this product right and you know I
went back and forth back and forth back
and forth to I'm sure the labs want to
like take me hang me upside down and
beat me because of like how meticulous
and picky and I am but you know this is
my brand this is me cream this by myself
no one's helping me I set my own money
on this brand I am doing this and you

let's touch on st. Jude oh my gosh we
had such a successful run with st. Jude
and about if you guys don't know what
I'm talking about I did a fundraiser
with st. Jude raising money it is a
place that treats childhood cancer and
it is tricky for the children you know
what's so honored to be able to work
with them and do something great like
that and use my social media for the
greater good if you want to donate to
st. Jude all have a link down below you
can still donate but we did add a little
campaign in June so was to reach around
$50,000 and we blew through that goal so
quickly we raised at the exact number we
raised right here we killed it guys you
guys really did that and I can't believe
like how we all came together and you
know change the world for the greater
good I am firm believer that we changed
the world if you were able to do any
money you're changing the world for the
greater good shout out to Linda Morphy
the owner of morphe cosmetics and morphe
brushes who donated $25,000 - thank you
$25,000 guys that is a lot of money
charge every star and many MUA my few
best friends in the world who donated
thousands and thousands thousands of
dollars you guys killed it it's just so
amazing to to have best friends that you
know that was my little journey with
Saint Jude and they took it upon
themselves to make it their journey as
well for me to meet that goal and
donated their hard earned money to st.
Jude and I just love them so much and
it's just so awesome to have friends
that back you up 100% on things that
you're working on or that are dear to
your heart so I love you guys you
already know that and thank you so much
for donating but I take it inside three
side brides I take the shade Daisy also
while we're on the subject of friends I
have so many questions about like
friends in social media and I know it's
interesting and like the T unfriend
friendships do change throughout social
media they you guys have seen people be
friends and they you see them not hang
out so much and I just wanna say that
doesn't always mean like there's some
massive giant
- a story behind it it sometimes means
that people drift apart and other people
come in I think that is a normal thing
in life have you ever been really close
to someone and maybe have a new friend
like has it ever happened
I want to throw that out there and for
you guys you know I just see on Twitter
every time you comment something
someone's like what about this person or
that person or this person is that
person is like guys human beings are
allowed to get closer to another person
it's natural it happens it doesn't mean
like there's some giant t story on what
happened now there are falling out
absolutely people have falling out
thanks half of what we know is life next
I'm going to take angry with an R 39
brush again bring it back and try to
keep it about the makeup because
sometimes there's no T and it's just
like us living our lives that people
trying to stir the pot well there's no
pot to be stirred to begin with life is
live friends come and go and sometimes
people are there for a season or reason
you know and maybe a season maybe
they're there to be to get you through a
certain spot in your life or to be there
with you w to grow to the next part of
your life and then they're out or maybe
they're there for a reason and they stay
and they don't go anywhere that happens
you know and they're friends for the
rest of your life so you just live your
life be a positive person and you know
I'm going to talk to you a to a little
bit of all your energy and what you keep
around gonna take hey girl right here
and what you keep around you because I
just find this to be so important and I
like to put a little inspiring messages
throughout my get ready with me video so
here goes so the other day on Twitter I
think it was like Gabriel's the more
that actually like showed this to me or
something like that
I leave this section a couple months ago
or so but it was Oprah and God knows it
was good as it was Oprah she was saying
you're responsible for the energy that
you put out into the world being the
person that you are but you're also just
as responsible for the energy that you
keep around you if someone's negative
shady or doing something sketchy or
they're not a good person in general and
you know that you're responsible for
keeping them around you and I know I
know I am well aware that that is easier
said than done to keep people out your
life because it's a family member or
your partner spending all of your energy
suffering because of their decisions is
not okay life is
very short it truly is I was 16
yesterday and today I'm 28
life is short it moves fast guys you can
get through anything they you've set
your mind to if you need to get someone
out of your life because you know it's
wrong and you know they shouldn't be
there you know that they're toxic let
them go
it's going to be hard it is hard it's
always hard letting going people I've
let go friends before I've let go of
multiple friends and I've let go of
friends and and let them come back and
I'm like what the do I do this I
know sometimes like it can be a
financial burden or it can be dangerous
to let people go but your life is so
short you think you can't get past
things you think you can't get through
things you think you're not strong
enough without you know these toxic
people in your life but you are and
you're better than that and you can let
it go and you just have to find strength
within in and also find a good support
system around you with good happy people
around you to help support you and get
you through a hard time of letting go
whether it be you know a boyfriend or a
bad family member or you know even a
co-worker I've had you know toxic
co-workers I'm going to take this
chocolatey color and put it in the
crease but I've even you know you're
stuck you like ant get away from Memphis
or at work but you can distance yourself
from them and you don't hang out around
them at work you know and you can just
be professional and leave it at that
leave it at the door whenever you leave
work leave it at the door you're very
responsible for the energy you keep
around you and that's something I really
focused on in the year 2017 and someone
is just kind of toxic and not right for
me I had a Lome go and that happens in
life and I'm not just talking about
friendships I'm talking about everyone
in general around me but I live such a
healthier life and I know it sounds so
selfish to you know kick people out of
your life but just remember your life is
very short and if you spend it with
people who are dragging you down or
making you do bad things like you have
bad thoughts making you act a certain
way then let them go you know what I
find it people like don't believe that
there's a happier person out there they
don't believe there's better friends out
there they don't believe there's a
better job out there
you gotta believe that to let someone go
you got to believe that you'll get past
something you'll get over
thing you'll move on I've been in the
area where I'm like no this is the best
person in the world from me I'll never
find a better boyfriend never find a
better friend I'll never climb better
you will and once you do it once it
makes you stronger and throughout life
like I've let go of people and it's been
so hard and I've cried in there crying I
cried and cried and once I let him go
the next toxic person in my life on my
bitch I know I won't get over you
because I get over the last one it like
teaches you in your brain I am strong
enough identify and I'll do it again I'm
gonna take palm tree with my finger and
put it on top of that concealer I hope
that this message speaks to some of you
guys out there just know that I know me
youtubers would just know I'm a real
person in my home right now who's
experienced real situations and letting
people go in hard times and I just want
to encourage you guys the tricky thing
is I find it with letting people go
sometimes once they're gone your heart
automatically remembers all the good
parts about it and blocks off anything
bad about that person in your brain your
heart gets in the way and really all the
good the good be good and you're
blocking out all the bad and why you
need it to let them go in the first
place so remember to get really mind
strong and remember the bad things that
they do the toxic person that they are
and to let them go take them matte brown
skinny liner from G Way and top line as
well as trying to get in there really
thin line above the lash line like up in
there speaking about people in your life
I think there's a fine line between
helping someone and you know not just
abandoning ship and helping them through
a hard time versus you know keeping a
toxic person in your life and you need
to be sure not to get the two confused
because if helping someone is hurting
you or making you a toxic person or
keeping bad energy around you and making
you sad depress in a horrible place
maybe it's time to let that person go
but as you know helping a person get
through a hard time or helping a toxic
person become a better person is making
you so good inside making you feel like
you're doing right making you happy
inside and you're watching that person
grow and change then absolutely by all
means I think there's just like about
fineline of using that like oh I'm going
to fix this person and you really hurt
yourself in the process of doing that
I'm gonna take hangry and hey girls to
brown shade
and buck them on the lower lashline this
is an M 210 brush I take a little bit of
the chocolate color and also buff it on
the lower lash line I'm going to take
some the duo pomp and show mascara and
apply it to my upper and lower lashes
I'm going to apply some curvy by color
pop and then I'm going to take and make
it from Kylie Jenner this is the velvet
liquid also guys I have some travel
coming up which I'm really excited about
and I have a vlog channel really to like
taking the time to vlog some of my
upcoming travels I haven't been doing
that lately because I feel like people
you know it's like you go here you go
here you go here as like enough is
enough
but you know some of you guys requested
to see the blog or tweet I can't wait to
see the blog and I didn't blog the trip
and I feel so bad so I want to start
blogging a little bit more my trips I'm
more so than vlogging just my everyday
life versus when I go on vacation I'm
going to try to blog them for you guys
and I take and dress by abh this is a
lip gloss and just a llama in the center
she needs some shine I wanted to sign
out this video leaving you guys with a
positive method message girl let me
close my door that you know I remember
thinking back whenever I started my
channel and way back in Alabama be like
what you want to do for living and I
constantly didn't know I was always
confused and I was in college working
really hard for something that I really
didn't even want to do I was trying to
get a marketing degree I don't really
want to work in marketing I didn't want
to work in an office that just wasn't
for me and it's like why am i busting my
ass failing at getting a job that I
don't even want sending thousands of
dollars on a career and I'm not trying
to stop anyone for going to college
because I actually encouraging it you
know it's an expensive life lesson but
you'll learn a lot of life lessons in
college and it'll make you tough but
besides the point for me personally in
my journey it just wasn't my calling and
that's whenever I took a really big risk
with YouTube and I started my journey
and I started before YouTube even is
what it is today
YouTube was not this big not this many
people watching youtubers my favorite
makeup youtubers
had millions of subscribers like that
wasn't like now a lot of people have a
million subscribers times of brands work
with influencers back when I started it
wasn't like that was a nearly first soul
soul dream of happiness I knew I can
make some money on YouTube but I didn't
know I could make good money off youtube
I didn't know I could create a makeup
line and I remember wanting to create
and make up my mind but I always told
myself well that dreams a little big and
a little unrealistic don't know why I
always tell myself there I was just like
you can't do that that's a little
unrealistic let's find a dream that you
can actually achieve and it makes me
want to punch myself I just wish I would
have had more someone just to tell me
this you can do it you can do whatever
the you want to do and no one can
stop you let me just tell you that you
can do whatever you want to do whatever
you truly put your heart soul mind blood
power energy into you can do you can't
have ask something and do it you can put
your whole heart into something your
whole entire life invested into
something you can do it absolutely
whatever you want to do no dream is too
big no telling what might happen with my
life and what other injures I might do
besides a makeup line but now that I
prove to myself that I can do anything I
know that whatever else I want to do I
absolutely can do it and I will make it
happen if my heart soul and mind is
invested in it I'll make it happen
I love stoppable you are unstoppable you
need to be a really strong headstrong
person a really invested person and with
those things I feel like you can really
make anything come true whether you want
to be a youtuber you want to be a doctor
you want to be an astronaut you going to
be a deep-sea diver you wanna be a
professional sports player whatever you
want to do you absolutely can do but
you're gonna have to put your all
everything you got into it make your
dream something you work on day in and
day out not once a month not once every
other month not once a week every single
day you're doing something to get a
little bit closer to your dream because
what's going to happen is you're going
to look back in a year and go back in
two years three years and that little
inch that you took everyday to get
closer to your dreams you're going to be
all the way over here so this video was
encouraging and leave
feeling a little bit lifted if you're
lost in the world or you know if you're
down or if someone's pulling you down I
hope this video lifts you up and gives
you just a little bit of strength to get
through the day I love you guys I love
