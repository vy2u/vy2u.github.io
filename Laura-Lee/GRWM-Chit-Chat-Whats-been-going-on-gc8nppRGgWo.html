video is going to be a get ready with me
video and I haven't done these in
forever and honestly this going to be a
long-ass video I can already feel it
it's gonna be a chitchat video I'm going
to update you guys so much that I've
been working on and so much that's
happening in my life and you guys don't
know about um I just it's finally been
like I would say like almost a year I
feel like since I'm done with these
videos which is such a shame and for
those of you who want to know more about
me or what I'm working on and what's
going on in my life you've come to the
right place and also if you want to get
ready with me just grab your makeup at
home grab a snack grab your mom cat dog
grandma whatever you got and chill with
me and we're going to jump right in the
video and it's not so much going to be
about some makeup and I will link all
the makeup that are used in this video
down below so if you have questions
it'll be there about whether it is
subscribe to my channel before you leave
we're in different in this video so I'm
just gonna start getting ready and like
I said if you have questions check the
description box for all makeup I'm using
but also I wanted to say that I am
having a big giveaway going on my
Instagram right now if you want to enter
it my Instagram handle is Lara Lee and
it's super easy to enter all you have to
do is tag a friend and follow me so be
sure and into that and I've isn't Lana's
got to come out it gives me the worst
lift I guess how many questions about my
teeth and I had the Invisalign which did
a whirlwind of straightening on my top
teeth and now this tooth right here
doesn't want to move back so that this
one can come forward and then these can
lay straight this I got pretty straight
but this one's being a turd so I got
these extra hooks Oh put on my teeth and
they're going to help pull the teeth
back I've had such a great experience
within this line like it's been a true
dream it's fix my teeth so quickly it
wasn't that painful at all however
whenever they put a hook liner tapes and
new hooks are kind of sharp so they're
rubbing their mouth raw but like in a
few days and we sharp anymore they kind
of dull and it's so much better cool so
it's had to wait it out inside of my
mouth will be raw and then we'll move on
but anyways that is what's happening
with my teeth right now I get so many
question
and I also get so you see on my teeth
are dark back here I'm super open about
my teeth by the way I don't care I get
people all the time like hating on me
like fix your nasty mouth your teeth are
rotten in the back they're actually not
rotten they were run I guess you could
say because those four cavities and if
you have money you can afford to get the
feelings that are the cover color of
your teeth
they cost extra to get the feelings that
look like your tooth color so you can't
see the feeling but these are really old
fillings which I'm having them redone as
well it's all a big working process on
my mouth guys just hang with me my teeth
I'm working on it but I got those
feelings when I was in my early 20s and
living on my own I had no money and I
barely had money to get the fillings
done themselves much less the teeth
color feeling so I just went with the
cheapest option and girl fix my teeth so
they don't fall on my head and they're
dark so every time I'm like oh it looks
like my teeth a run I was a broke-ass
girl so I honestly don't open up to to
too much about my life because I find it
on YouTube now like it's so sad
everybody just wants to use everything
against you and you have to be
vulnerable and just put yourself out
there knowing that these drama channels
and whoever will use whatever
information they can about you against
you rather than for you and it just
sucks so it makes you want to clam up in
a show do I will we'll just keep it
about the makeup and you won't know
about me like it that's how it makes you
me feel inside but you know there are so
many of you guys who follow me and stay
out of that out of the mess so it's just
like not fair for you guys to not know
anything about me come on come on guy
god this is a new concealer my other one
like expired so I got to do one and I
couldn't get it to come out this isn't
Mac Pro Longwear concealer what else is
good with me
well I will tell you I'm working on a
lot of projects one is the biggest and
you guys can't know too much about it
what you can I'm just choosing not to
tell you too much about it because I'm
working on my own project by myself I do
not have anymore
a plan i've actually had some planned
and that ended up not doing them because
if my heart is not into something 120
percent it's not happening and i would
never you know collab or create
something that i'm not using on the
daily or something that I'm not
absolutely obsessed with at with as i
would want you guys to be I won't do it
and I mean I feel like I haven't collabs
a lot in my career time and I could have
collabs you know a lot on my career time
on YouTube but I chosen not to because
it's got to be right not to say like I'm
too good or pick too picky it's just my
heart has to be in it and the products
got to be right and when it's not I walk
away and that's to protect you guys and
you know make a good honest decision
YouTube is such a weird industry and I
feel like it's just weird that you know
I started this career on YouTube not
knowing that I would be where I'm at
today and never in a million years
guessing that talking about YouTube
makes me so emotional so you hear me
have a whimpering voice it's no excuses
in fact it makes me emotional talk what
you do because of how hard taking me and
well it's done for my life and like I
know you guys don't know what I know you
guys don't know like how much it's done
for me
that I do so it like makes a heart weak
the whole point in YouTube is creating
it yourself and their logo back in the
day was broadcast yourself on even knows
that YouTube's logos still and it was
basically you know you create your own
journey with YouTube and like I created
this and YouTube's allowed me to create
this and you guys supporting me as made
this happen so it's just crazy and it
always makes me like whenever I talk
about my journey a little bit and this
is Charlotte Tilbury setting powder and
I like to put them on a Beautyblender
I'm like oh like all over the place I'm
so ATD by the way I can be upset one
minute and the next I'm like Oh Becky my
mom has been like a huge supporter of my
youtube since day one
she literally watches everything one of
my vid
Leo's including my vlog videos you still
watches every single video thanks mom
anyways YouTube is such a weird career
and the saddest thing about it like I
mean you have to wonder what some people
you know background from in Alabama say
about it and the saddest thing about it
is a lot of people the first thing they
say about it is that's not going to last
her very long and I just think that
that's so sad like to see someone come
out of your hometown and make something
big happen and the only thing you have
to say about it is that's not going to
last long and I've heard that like here
and there like it's disgusting to me
because what that says to me is you saw
someone succeed and the first thing you
did is tear it down in some way that way
it makes you feel better about what
you're doing in your life maybe you
don't like you're where you want to be
so if someone else is the first thing
you do is find a way to tear it down and
I just think that's so gross and
disgusting and not only that I have to
say this and if you know any other
youtuber off there you're working on a
dream and people don't believe in it
listen to me when I tell you this if
you're smart enough to get where you're
at you're smart enough to stay there you
know what I mean you're smart enough to
keep it going
I guess people think I'm an idiot who
just puts on makeup on the internet
whenever they don't realize how many
people have not been able to have a
booming career out of YouTube just
because it is a hard thing to do and
there's so much that goes on the back
end that people can't handle or don't
want to handle or don't want to be a
part of and you got to be tough to do
this and I'll tell you that anyone who
made it on YouTube is a tough person
whether the mental abuse the cyber
bullying the business it goes behind it
all like you got to be smart and you got
to be tough and anyone who's made out on
YouTube is those things this is who look
lion sir and I'm just adding into my
cheek if I'm smart enough to get where
I'm at today and four and a half years
get to over three million subscribers do
you not think that I've invested my
money into myself like come on people
like I I hope that speaks mountains to
you whatever you're trying to do in your
life you know if people try it or have
anything negative to say about how far
you come
go you know they're sitting in the back
of their head cringing because of your
success and it makes people feel small
whenever you're really successful it
makes them feel like they haven't done
enough or their life doesn't compete to
your so they're mad about it honestly
and that's how people feel and don't let
them ever tell you your dreams not big
enough your dreams aren't going to last
what you're doing stupid if you believe
in yourself girl roll with it because at
the end of the day it's you that you
have to count on not those people so I
hope that's inspiring for you guys and
that's truly the way I feel about it and
I know my career is going to last and I
also know that I am a smart girl and I
know I got here from being a smart girl
and an honest person and true to myself
so I hope that is inspiring for you guys
and I hope that you know maybe some of
that will rub off on you as well this is
like my quote to live eyes I don't like
to gamble but if there's one thing I'm
willing to bet on it's myself and I can
agree with that more there's one girl in
this world that I would put every dollar
on and that is me I would invest every
penny in the world in me because I know
how smart I am and I know how far I can
take myself and I hope those of you
watching right now I hope you know that
and I hope that you feel that too and I
hope that you know you're not depending
your life on a man or on a woman or on
your parents I hope that you invest
every penny in yourself and I hope that
you all believe in yourself that you can
do and achieve anything that you want to
and I hope you invest your time your
efforts your life loving yourself taking
care of yourself investing in yourself
and that way end of the day you're who
you have to count on nobody else now I
got to say at the end of the day there
are definitely people who are super
excited for me in my career that I've
created for myself and all that I've
accomplished like they just right with
me and they're so excited for me and I
feel like those people right there are
people who do believe in themselves they
believe in themselves other people and
they're genuinely happy for other people
and you can't expect someone like me the
most annoying person on the inner
it for everybody to love them and I'm
not here for everybody to love me girl
you love me stay you don't keep it
moving I will grow on you though I'll
tell you that
you know I grow on people you watch my
channel a few times and I'm super
annoying and you hate me and then all of
a sudden you're stuck watching 20 of my
videos I grew up people what can one of
my few projects that I'm working on is a
merch line I'm trying to come out I'm
not trying to come out March I am coming
out with March I'm going to come out
with some shirts and hats and some other
cute things I'm working on them right
now I'm working on designing them um
they're gonna be very largely merch and
I hope you guys are excited about it I'm
so excited about it like I just looking
back it always again makes me emotional
because I never saw anything like this
happening and then now it's happening
and I'm like who are you and it's just
like one of the most joyous things that
I've ever done creating things by myself
even in collabs is one of the most
joyful things that you can ever do
because everything about it is your
creation and it's just like it's just
like the forms of Sluttery feeling in my
heart whenever I see X I'm like this is
me and the fact yeah you know I don't
know it's just something about like
creating anything yourself there's
something truly genius about it and it
just makes me feel all kinds of ways can
you use a little bit of this Maybelline
blush palette because I didn't really
like in it this is really freaking
pretty so I am working on merch so hang
tight for that we are building a website
we are built it there's a lot that goes
into it by the way it's not like I'll
put this pretty name here I'm also
creating more than merch that under the
hair and hopefully these things will
launch this year I will tell you Labs
take a real long time to create anything
it is not a day and night process it is
a month-to-month process and we are
doing things right we are taking our
time and it's got to be perfect so just
know there is a lot more coming and I'm
doing it by myself
so so because obviously my face looks a
little powdery I like to wet it and if
you can see the product is setting
on the hairs my face so it's still like
this weird spray as like on the hair so
I like to take a Beauty Blender and look
at how it like pushes it into the skin
and it sets everything it's locks in
that setting powder too and it makes
everything look more skin light versus
powdery on top of the skin you can't go
wrong doing this and it also just takes
seconds to just do this and like fill in
your face also wanna say I know this is
it's kind of cliche to be like I it is
well that thanks you guys
but I want to thank you go out I guess I
could turn this on silent right I just
want to thank you guys for allowing me
to be myself on my channel and
supporting that I get comments all the
time like almost every day telling me
they love Who I am and even other
youtubers have told me that they
committed me for being a raw myself
person on my channel and just let
anything go most you know I'm like the
opposite of perfectionist if something's
wrong something's in my teeth so think
on my lips have lipstick on tape it's
going to keep rolling because I'm not a
perfectionist and I've never put myself
out there on the internet to pretend to
be anything that I'm not I'm a little
bit of a mess and I think not only I
feel like that's relatable but that's
not why I do it to be relatable I do it
because like I can't be anyone else but
that person I can try to be perfect but
no matter what the end of the day I come
off a hot mess because that's who I am
I'm a human being and I am Lauren Lee
and I am quirky and weird oh I have a TV
I'm all over the place I messed things
up I mess up my makeup I'm a human being
and that is who I wouldn't be on the
internet I want to be me and that way if
you meet me one day you you meet the
girl that you saw behind the camera and
not some other person who looks
different or acts different when I'm
going to be honest it would have been
easier my career would have been so much
easier if I would just would have been a
perfect beauty blogger who was super
perfect and everything that I do and
didn't show any mistakes because then I
wouldn't have to take any of the
criticism because I show my mistakes and
if I mess up my lip liner or my
eyeshadow or I have a booger or I have a
moustache hair I get criticized to hell
and back and I'm okay with it
and you have to be tough to be able to
take that but um I'd rather be
criticized to hell and back then to be
this person this fake person that I'm
not I'm just post videos for you guys to
learn how to makeup I also post them to
connect with you guys and for you guys
to see a real human being doing real
makeup I know a lot of you guys see that
and maybe to like take your mind off
your day and focus on a video there's so
many out of you out there who don't
criticize me for being myself you moreso
encourage it or thank me for being
myself and you're the ones who stand
behind me and help me to be this person
that I am and help me to like stay
strong when the whole world's telling me
to stop being annoying or stop making
those weird sounds or stop doing this or
be like everyone else and I refuse to do
it was those of those that stand behind
me and push for me to be myself and like
that's something that I can't thank you
enough or there's no worse that I can
say to thank you truly for that I'm
going to grab this lighter shade to
start off with I'm going to dust it all
over my eyelid to soften up my eyeshadow
primer and grab this shade right here
and I'm going to blend it in the crease
as my transition shade oh I got some tea
for you guys it's super new and you guys
are literally going to have a lot to say
about this I'm sure in the comment
section so for whatever reason people
are get really obsessed with the fact
that I don't wear a wedding ring in my
youtube videos I've already told you
guys a couple of times that I don't wear
it because like my a special piece to me
that it wasn't really to show off or
she's constantly have on my hand in my
videos for people to look at it was just
like this prized possession to me and I
just felt like not really keeping it
private because so many you guys have
seen it in blogs from my snapchat just
more so I don't know it's just like a
special little piece to me my wedding
ring is gone I lost my wedding ring I'm
99.9% sure I left it in a hotel in
London it was a ring that I got when I
think I was 23 24 23 picked a ring out
and pretty much designed the ring myself
I was 22 title
I mean it wasn't as beautiful ring I've
ever seen and I still didn't buy the
Iowa's still most beautiful ring I've
ever seen
all this trouble I had the craziest trip
of my life and I went to London and came
home without a wedding ring and I am
realized my wedding ring was in London
until about a month after the trip
because my ring was missing I didn't
wear my ring every day was a thick big
ring that stood tall it was a big guy's
wedding ring it was beautiful let me
grab the shade right here and then me
and I you know have been looking for it
for a long-ass time and we couldn't find
the ring anywhere we traced it back to
like pictures and everything me having
it in London and then me never having it
again we've torn apart everything in our
life our house our luggage gone through
every piece of clothing pocket that we
have every purse every drawer we've
picked up living room rugs and flip them
upside down and shake them just to make
sure it wasn't in the shaggy carpet
we've moved furniture the ring is gone
the ring is in London I'm pretty sure
I'm 99.9% sure I left at a hotel and now
I don't have a wedding ring so that's
why I wear in my videos now because I
don't have one so if you see people
asking please and light them on that
knowledge or tell them to watch my video
and they would know I am I'm already in
the looks of redesigning the same ring
maybe a little bigger that's so terrible
just me be real with you pretty much
creating the same ring over again and
yet I'll have a wedding ring hopefully
not too long again and maybe I'll share
it with you guys maybe you want I don't
know corn ahah spills out of it um but
that piece of jewelry can never truly be
replaced to me because from a tech pot
that me and how I met when we were in
high school for those you don't know and
we've been together nine years straight
and I grabbed this beautiful purple
shade think about it and it hurts to
think about it but I'm just not the type
to have a panic attack over it or
honestly I won't have a panic attack
about anything unless I think it starts
being losing my life or someone I love
getting hurt I don't have panic attacks
I don't even have an anxiety which is
something super audit about me and I
haven't really had
IIT and like I think I had probably
exactly when I was little but I think my
mom literally has never been the type to
have anxiety or to be like a worrywart
and my mom was author that has a person
who didn't hide things from me you know
we were broke we were broke and I knew
we were broke if the power was getting
turned off I knew I was getting turned
off mom never lied about things girl we
broke you daddy didn't pay the bill the
powered and turned off
I lost melted things because they're my
childhood and they made me smile because
I loved my childhood and looking back
like it just makes me smile like just
knowing like how crazy it was and just
how unconventional my family was and it
was just it was what it was and I feel
like just like my mom just being like
well you know and moving on with
her life instead of like having anxiety
attacker and our life was so crazy and
there would have been so many good
reasons for her to have panic attack so
she was just like well and she
still liked that and I think that that's
why I'm like how I am today like I just
well
life goes on keep it moving that's
literally my life motto if you're
friends with me like Manny Jeffery Alden
have probably heard me say keep it
moving 10 million times because that is
like my motto when it's all falling down
girl you better just keep it moving get
out of the rubble and keep them moving
don't slow down you have to leave I get
history and say okay so our power and
water got turned off and we were broke
pretty much my whole childhood and Here
I am 28 years old looking back in is
everybody okay yes it's everybody safe
yes
how are things now they're great so why
worry just move on and if your home life
at home is not conventional or you feel
like you're not enough or you feel like
your family doesn't have enough or
whatever girl you cannot worry about
that or compare yourself to the worst
rest of the world it doesn't define who
you are as a person
it doesn't make you or break you you
define you as a person you decipher your
value and Worth and not what you have in
your bank account
all these things are just things and at
the end of the day I wouldn't be where
I'm at without myself because I can tell
you one thing straight money did not get
me where I'm at today I had no money
when I started this career people are
like oh she had a husband that worked at
Amazon and made money no I started this
career way before he worked at Amazon
and his Amazon money didn't buy any of
my career I worked full-time and did it
all by myself with what I created and I
don't know I'm like going on a rabbit
trail but I just want you guys I feel
like people get stuck in a rut all the
time and feel like they're not enough or
they're worthless like I truly feel that
people feel like that I see it in my
comic section I'm like how can you think
like that like that is not true if I can
do one thing right in this world I think
I can change people's way of thinking
about themselves and get girls and boys
and girls and human beings to understand
their value and work and once you've
done that you are unstoppable once you
know your value and Worth you're
unstoppable that's why I guess getting
people to understand their value is so
important to me because I think it takes
you so much further than you would ever
believe knowing what you're worth this
is like a deeper bronzy gold and then
I'm actually I'm going to mix it into
this Inglot pigment as well for those of
you who don't know I think a lot of you
probably do with some of you might not
know about my family I lost my dad and
December last year December 10th 2016 my
dad passed away it's something that I
don't really go on and on about because
I'm not strong enough to talk about it
really um and one day I will be and one
day I will talk to you guys about it
more and the reason I want to talk to
you guys about it because I know there's
those of you out there who have dealt
with loss and I want to be able to help
people get through it losing someone
like a parent is an indescribable
feeling and it's not easy because I'm
able to outreach to so many people
I want to be able to talk to you guys
about it and maybe help people get
through their loss or just be you know a
moment to then and breathe about it and
how you're feeling about it I'm not
really strong enough to do so right now
but eventually I will be and I will talk
to you guys more about you know me
listen my dad so I'll get back on that
night
these are black magic by icon lashes
also I want to let you guys know that I
recently went to Tennessee Matt this
Tennessee that is and I was there with
Saint Jude I chose to volunteer my time
to go out there and learn about st. Jude
this is a hospital and I actually got to
hang out with some of their patients and
the children there it was a super big
experience for me I'll put it that way
it was an eye-opener and I got to learn
about so much at the hospital and what
all they do and how it all works and you
know they actually incited a lot of
beauty influencers and sadly only four
of them win um I just wish if I'm being
really honest I'm not trash be shady and
call out the beauty community I just
wish more people would have went to
support the cause and I really stood up
for a beauty community and show us how
strong we are and and that we are here
for more than just the makeup but hey
they got four of us that went and I
think that that is a big movement as it
is and I'll take it for what it is now
I'm putting this shade in this shade on
my lower lash line
it is a hustle where their patients
don't have to pay a penny to go there
and to be treated and could you imagine
you know could you just imagine hearing
your child has cancer and all and God
not being able to afford going out and
getting the treatment so that's the
beauty and Saint you there patients
don't receive a bill and it's because of

Tyler are going to be donating to st.
Jude because it is a huge part of my
heart and I will definitely be donating
to it for sure
and I want to encourage you to donate if
you can donate $1 that is huge to them
and that means so much to them to keep
the hospital running it takes boo cools
as you can imagine to keep a hospital
like that sighs that running is huge
they need everyone's help and I think in
life whenever you give you get in so
many ways that you don't even know so
I'll put the link down below to donate
to st. Jude I'm not being paid to talk
about it I hope that that's obvious it's
just something that's dear to my heart
and I would love for you know you guys
to have the chance to get back to a huge
cause which everybody and world Couture
that Hospital and just be a part of what
I saw and that experience because it
changes your life and it makes
everything in this world comes become so
small to you this is kim k by charlotte
tilbury but give what you see fit in
your budget and I hope you guys you know
give it a chance and you can own the
website and read out more and more they
treat teenagers as well and they just do
so much for the children to make it seem
like they're still at home they throw a
prom for kids in high school so they can
still have that prom and also they're
able to bond with other people their age
that have cancer and so they're not
alone st. Jude is also a Research
Hospital where they're able to find
cures and work on cures and work on
treatment different treatments to get
rid of the cancer it costs a lot to keep
that running and keep those that
research going but they have now raised
I believe the death rate a survival rate
of cancer with 20% and they've gotten it
up to 80% now and it's growing because
of their research so your money also
goes to that and I think I mean if you
got anything to donate this would be the
moment to donate it or the cause to
donate it to dear to my heart and what
