I wish I had dollar family youtubers
look at her body it's not look at this
scar I fell down a ladder when I was a
kid I thought that was a tiny little
birthmark no it's a scar I'll add our
parents should we get a better climb got
a huge ladder can you give us a better
story shark I was there it is that's
what I want to hear are you have make a
good story behind uh-huh it's okay I'm
so where do you know what level ratchet
I am now
Gabby Hanna ratchet okay how do I make
myself look pretty on Dixon Noah uh
honey you're the prettiest of them all
you think I'm pretty
you make me okay I mean I just got a
walk from your Chipotle when you did
that probably just blowing in oh by the
way guys I don't have foundation on
right now
but don't you think her skin looks so
pretty I was so shocked so this is new
in the community that's right Gabi Hanna
she's a beauty blogger she's just
starting out she really hasn't been on
social media very long all I need to be
a beauty youtuber is the lights now
that's right I everything I was like
last collabs yeah I'm coming to the
events I'm here Karlis that's right
I did a makeup review the other day you
did she put on her makeup with her hair
hey you know what that doesn't have
enough use on it okay we're gonna
promote that video right now I really
thought that that was gonna do something
I did I thought that people were gonna
click it I did my entire face full of
makeup with just my hair like would you
not click that apparently not okay so me
and Gabi just finished filming the video
on her Channel and that's why I don't
have foundation on cuz we swapped beauty
routines that's why I'm Colby and that
is why I'm not a full coverage girl
today
ask him if they knew before you said it
did you guys know like something was off
she doesn't have on her full keg like
foundation did you guys know before I
said it down below they're all they
don't know I love how we started this
video without an intra so basically
Gabi's entering the beauty world pretty
fast okay
she knows makeup a lot but I I feel like
I pulled products that I really don't
think you know okay and I'm gonna make
you guess the price I'm on I'm into this
challenge okay I watch reviews okay like
say like somebody comes out with a
foundation I will watch every single
damn review I'm gonna wear foundation
you better stop what what makes you want
to do that I don't know got it I just
like listening to people talk about it
Wow
fascinating it's a weird guilty pleasure
I love the drama too so like if there's
like a drama around a friend oh honey
she's in it I am sure like if you like
to start off a review by saying like no
this brand should have done this and I'm
gonna tell you right now that this is
not okay
you're going to like review the product
as its own but then the person never
actually like you may or may not be
talking about turn shape tape foundation
but I loved heart okay so check out her
channel subscribe to her she's amazing
she also will make you laugh thanks very
um in today's video because Gabi is not
she's like entering the beauty giver
world and she knows makeup but that's a
wife success sacred grounds and I don't
know otherwise things like that I watch
Laura Lee it's her favorite brush she
has a million of them too I will show
them how many there's more I start
growing
that's a thumbnail can you can you for
me no no we're not doing it well are you
guys seeing my subscribe song yeah you
are got too much and no subscribe
subscribe to my channel
yeah leave my voice on how do you a bra
you go sucks
exactly like that yes honey okay we're
doing this is the first product gonna
let you hold it and touch it and feel it
here's the thing I know that la Prady is
an expensive phrase dang it I didn't
want you to know that I told you I
watched beauty videos is this a
translucent powder maybe okay cellular
treatment loose powder let me read being
greed Ian's because that'll help a lot
okay so this is a translucent powder
it's 56 grams net weight 2 ounces I'm
gonna say that this is $80 no more yeah
120 105 wow that's a lot that is a lot
repair I would expect that from a brand
like Sicily right but from a la Prairie
did you buy this um I have bought lots
of library to review but they actually
because I reviewed it they sent me that
one okay here's my thing let's hear it
does this work well it has horrible
flashback that is unacceptable
absolutely if you have a powder for a
hundred and five dollars it better if
you cook you dinner that better flatten
your stomach flatten your stomach that
better fucking your picture hairline
are you kidding me 105 with flashback
who invented is James Charles like
probably you sir mr. James no but that
that's asinine yes even if this was the
most perfect powder like I love Laura
Mercier this is cream powder same if
that was better than this that should
not be $105 in makeup industry this is a
normal girl who wears a normal that's
right I don't think so
well like they're a brand that they're
selling enough to like be in stores and
look because their markup is like 100
per
true see there's your markup so there's
a thing god only knows how much that's
you shut bonkers yes shook I know you
know this wait is this the fucking
teardrop you see everybody on the
Instagram with two tears no yeah I can't
believe that people still do that
because it was like funny for like a
second but then it gets serious and now
people still like do or they're like but
no it's like one of those jokes that
like doesn't die yeah like you know when
people like how it onto on fleek for way
too long yeah this is one of those
things were like oh wait let me work
that one sleek use reminded me no one's
like one of those things where everybody
at first they're doing it like oh my god
I'm a beaut watch me be an Instagram
video and now they be still doing it
like okay we get it was it smell like
I like it 80 why do I keep guessing 80
[Laughter]
that is 54 bucks
dammit I really thought I was going to
kill me you thought it was someone I
really thought this was Lux well I
understood I think 54 is still Lux but
you thought this was like la Prairie 54
for what is it primer yeah I didn't
think that into consideration of just
like what it was yeah fuck I mean dang
yeah Dan okay this is expensive this is
what's the brand again
um I can't pronounce the brand but it is
this Lee no it's fine this is it this is
a random expensive brand you haven't
heard of this I know but I know the
brand where they just have like the
foundation the primer the highlighter
it's called DD and that search through
the P plate app oh yeah you've never
used this no I'm gonna do a review on it
I think it's a really pretty container I
mean it makes my heart melt I would buy
this as a paperweight from my office for
at least not fifteen to twenty fifteen
to twenty for sure for a paperweight
decoration yeah this is $140 more which
is like that's bonkers I'm naming high
prices because these are those you know
I know is expensive I'm saying a price
that I think is ridiculously high 200
more shook I almost said but I know that
you can't say that on your chance say it
before I would ever in your home it's
more than 200 it's more to 20 more
you're planning this is 250 yeah I in
what in what world honey now this is my
career so you know I buy it to like
review it but you bought this with money
I did see i buy i buy this stuff yeah
two hundred and fifty dollars that is a
hold on I need to do some math you could
buy 31 she pull a chicken bowls with
that girl I'm done
that could beat you for a month how many
how many uses do you think you get out
of this like realistically
oh let's think let's think let's think
like I I can see the size and kind of
you're gonna you're gonna use more
product whenever it's in a tub because
you know you're squeezing out a little
bit that you're gonna pour out more and
use more I would probably say 30 uses no
30 I wear a lot of makeup how much do
you get out of a bottle like a
fluctuation look whatever it is I don't
know because I switched foundations like
every three days you know so I'm not
very consistently used it's garbage
let's say a hundred just to be nice okay
that's generous let's say it to be nice
100 that's three dollars a day it was
like 250 a day if you get a hundred uses
justice foundation are you sure you're
like what is this dead-ass I thought
that this was um like a lucky stone
really yeah I like to skip but I was
gonna cute oh it's like a sidekick
trickery yes but how do you remember
that I love how your brain immediately
went so I think if I couldn't afford one
me either never travel guys I've never
even heard that I knew you wouldn't know
okay I actually didn't think you would
have heard of this one though i watch a
lot of videos sure that's true and it's
a bronzer I'm gonna say thirty bucks
I didn't say it was very fun books by
the way is right I didn't say it was
worth 30 bucks when I named these prices
it's like that it can't be 50 what do
you but that's crazy to me but this is
an eye shadow hunty no no that's an eye
shadow what I'm saying that is an eye
shadow can and did you pay for this with
money yes it did I bought it that's
crazy right $42 dude for an eye shadow a
thing I put that in my crease let me
tell you how fast my eye would go
through this if I use this every day as
a bronzer like dipping in going on yeah
but I just like don't understand why
like who's buying that because that's a
given love wanna go my question yeah
always my question I'm stressed okay
oh my god this has to be at least $100
it has to be right wait let me look
oh wait hold on with this type of foil
shadow no 120 minimum lower she's lying
low
lower lower than 90 lower not 45 45 oh
my god one two three four five six seven
14 shades at this pant size and this
consistent user stop forty five sheets
all you can do so many looks with this
you could do daytime looks there's so
many nice transition shades all over
shades there's a couple shimmers and
foils she just reviewed my whole palette
this is a date tonight
high-quality 14 pan shadows she deserved
and it's only $45 plus shipping it's a
very great competitive price for an
indie brand I think so too I think that
like super fair right I've seen things
cost a lot more with a lot less coming
on that's what I think and you worked
your little ass off on that and I said
this in a video I did about a week ago
but my favorite thing about this palette
let me tell ya see was your then I want
to hear it this bitch took notes yes she
really did and I think that everybody
should commend that shit because okay
cats do not you like shit yeah I
actually mean that before we were even
really friends I like texted Manny I was
like yo I actually really like this shit
please tell Laura cuz I didn't even that
thing says I love that shit but this you
know she got a lot of flack on your
packaging yep but your fucking took that
note I did and you did something about
it yeah and that's all I think you're
gonna ask her people she's a brand new
brand yes you learned you learned and
you took the criticize take your
criticism
- why she could have like fucking's
right I keep swearing
that's fine you could have turned that
on the world said they're all haters
they're gels you did it you have made a
beautiful sleek current usable you put
more shades in yep that's right she's
growing she's moving in she helped me to
gas me up every morning okay
no but I've been like dying too
I know I want watches so bad but like I
know it's like skincare right mm-hmm
what's this one um oh that's right
momento Elmo that's a face primer this
smells like dicks and I like it oh my
god I didn't realize that until you said
it $80 you're dead on the dot I mean
don't 52 on support and then you know
I've just been throwing them but
everywhere else is 80 think Sephora well
you want to it's cheaper at Sephora but
it is also tatcha if you want to know my
email address let me know how much was
this one okay I mean this one was 250
that one was one 105 that one's 105 140
let's see because I don't know it's
concealer and foundation actually don't
live yeah but anybody who uses this
foundation when it use that shade
concealer 140 40 more 200 more than 200
mm-hmm 250 lowered to 30 that makes me
sad technically this one's like the most
but yeah so this isn't a good pairing
that's what classy people do that's
probably true oh um I know this I know
you know this brand come on Tati loves
these yes she loves their great quality
my hands are so brave I must make up
life so pretty too sexual to me I don't
know what it is how many $80 it's

feels good
