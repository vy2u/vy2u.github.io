video is gonna be a top three get ready
with me we're gonna jump right in I'm
gonna be doing my hair with a new hair
tool called the InStyler which is
something completely different on my
channel and it turned my crusty second
day here into something fabulous so I'm
gonna let you know about that we're
gonna get started so just keep watching
getting started I'm really excited today
because in every hair video I am glad I
shaved my armpits in every hair video I
do
it's either straightening or curling my
hair and like that is it so I'm very
excited it's amazing a new little tool
here today and now it's I'm clipping
half my hair up and I Harris condition
right now is leftover from last night
called my hair last night get some
leftover hairspray in it and the curls
are crunchy and they need some help my
hair is frizzy I'm going to do is go in
with this installer which it's like this
tool that has this bristly brush here
that helps to fight the frizz and that
has the ceramic barrel on it which
rotates whenever you press down lightly
you don't have to squeeze it hard and
then it rotates left and right so you
can just like DoubleTap really light and
it'll switch the way it's going to
rotate I like to take a smaller section
of hair so what I'm going to do is I
like to do it like this click I like to
put my hair in it and then kind of give
it a little twist and slowly run my hair
through it
and wallah it looks nice and sleek but
my favorite thing about it is it's not
like straightening my hair flat to my
head it's giving me like a blowout
almost and giving my straight hair
volume so it's not just like but it's
like family curly hair and you get out
of the shower your hair is I really
thick and curly and wavy that's what
this tool is like specialized for it's
awesome for that or if you have thin
hair that needs some volume at the root
I would recommend this tool for that too
so again I got squeezed this thing hard
on my hair either I just lightly press
it and run it down my hair so there the
ionic bristles right here they really
help to get the frizz out of your hair
typically to do my whole head just
depending on like how straight I want it
it would take me about 10 minutes and I
have a lot a lot of hair so if you have
less hair it's definitely not going to
take you that long to curl your hair
with this little guy right here and
maybe I'll show you in another tutorial
like how you can do it get the beachy
wave or like the nice soft waves with
this tool I hate 7/32 it has four
different heat settings so just
depending on your type of hair I turn
mine all the way up because I'm trying
to get this curl out of my hair so here
is where I did my hair so I can like
flat straight a little bit of volume in
it and then this is my leftover frizz
piece that we're gonna do next
so yeah
also I just want to say it comes with a
heat guard and a little nozzle to help
you control it while styling your hair
but you can add that on if you want to
just to help you protect yourself or
just to help you get more control with
the tool being able to use two hands I'm
okay using it without it but that's just
preference that's one half in my hair
the smaller pieces I hear that you do
the easier it is so that's just if one
eye and wallah
there you have my hair it is all done
and it has just some volume to it so
this is what I was talking about I mean
yes girl yes a new friend that I have
and I thought I'd share with you I'll go
in with a little bit of the Tarte this
is their clean slate timeless primer and
I'm just going to apply this to areas
that need a little extra love and
smoothening out I say the same thing in
every tutorial so I wanted to do this
talk through get ready with me just to
chat with you guys because I feel like I
never get to talk to you guys about
anything but makeup because this is a
makeup channel and that may be all that
you want to hear and that's why I was so
hesitant on doing this video also I'm
going to be using the Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless and shade 220-pound
ation one of my favorite drugstore
foundations by the way and blend this
out with the trusty Beauty Blender
anyway so I figured I wanted it to just
chat with you guys about I'll just live
for channel which we are almost at
300,000 subscribers
we may already be there fully Polito
thank you guys so much for that I'm I'm
just like dumbfounded as to how we got
there that fast but I'm also very happy
as soo as being there that's so amazing
such an accomplishment like we did that
in a month guys we went from two hundred
to three hundred thousand a month found
going with a little bit on my on
associate dip brow pomade in the number
twelve
yes the number twelve brush from
Anastasio which is probably one of the
best brow brushes first like to comb the
beast up I'm out of breath
I'll take this warm neutrals palette
from Sigma it's just a really great
neutral palette and I'm going to take
this a cream color and what I like to do
with the e-40 brush is just soften up
the mac primer that I put on my eyelid
and that just makes everything blend out
easy I still going with my favorite
brush from Sigma this is the e25
blending like this is the best brush
from Sigma I think this one is like rose
gold and I'm going to tap into this
light pinky color and type out and tap
off the excess like I'm making this too
much like a makeup tutorial rather than
chatting with you guys blend this right
in the crease but I just want to talk to
you guys about my channel um and I'll do
crazy nice comments that I get I was
talking about on snapchat if you follow
me on snapchat you definitely should
because we chat on there guys we have
some serious conversations
yeah I'm snapchat about just the crazy
influence of nice comments that I get on
my channel I mean I know we all talk
about the hate comments because those
are the juicy ones to talk about you
know but I want to talk about the nice
comments first change and just say that
it's incredible and just reading through
you guys's comments legit gives me hope
in humanity because sometimes reading
through just comments on celebrities
pages and even other youtubers the
disgusting comments and some aren't even
that mean it's just no one can say
anything nice and no one you just you
have to be constantly correcting
somebody or just stating something that
was messed up in the background or you
just can't be nice like why can't you
not compliment the video but and that's
what literally makes me like is there
any hope in humanity like is this what
it's come to is this all that we do now
like we don't even we cannot say
anything nice but just reading through
the nice comments on my videos I'm like
oh yeah we still we got a little bit of
hope the exact same brush I'm gonna grab
this like a light brown
warm brown color with the same little
825 brush just gonna work that right on
top of the other color in the crease but
anyways I was just saying like you make
a difference you're warming people's
heart and not only if you realize it or
not you're warming your own heart when
you leave an a/c I mean everybody's
entitled to their opinion you don't have
to like everything on the internet you
have to agree with everybody whenever
you leave that nasty comments thank you
your makeup looks like poo if you didn't
like someone's makeup do you really feel
better did that make you feel better do
you really feel like a good person now
did that make your day better like
really think deep down inside like no
you feel guilty you should feel guilty
you feel guilty because you know better
and you know what you're doing is wrong
you know that you're tearing down people
and you think it's okay to do it just
because they have a bazillion comments
and they're not going to read it but
people read their comments they may not
always reply they're reading their
comments and they see it and you're
tearing down people next we'll grab this
dark brown maroon e color that's like
this red undertone and I'm still going
to be working in the crease oh man then
it turn out how I wanted it to so I
actually now go in with a e57 brush
which is like way more defining oh I
missed my eye and I'm just gonna put
this color right crease but I guess
that's just the point I'm trying to get
across like save yourself and save your
ugly comment like keep your ugly comment
to yourself in it I'm telling you it'll
make you feel better for not leaving me
in comments cuz leaving mean comments I
don't care who you are it is not make
you feel good or make you have a good
day this is kind of a mess but I'm gonna
clean it up on the lid I'm kind of mad
like you got taken too far down so I use
too big of a brush I made mistakes guys
we're all human I'll grab a little bit
of this shade the Lighting's making it
look a little bit lighter than it is but
it's like this topi paint color I'm
going to apply it to the lid this is an
e 58 shader brush these colors are a
little bit more pigmented than I
actually thought so that's why I messed
with the dark priests parks I didn't
think it was going to come off that much
and it did I'm going to be doing a
little bit of winged liner with my NYC
liquid liner and I'm not very honest
with you guys when you are for me it's
either goes so good that it just scares
me of how perfect it turned out or
either I do it and it's like Laura it's
just your first day ever doing the liner
like ever remember a happy medium is
either zero or 100
now man take a YP and I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of my mac prolongwear
concealer and then I'll go back and
finish the eyes per usual up F 57
concealer brush and I'm just gonna do
this
yeah and then I'm gonna blend it out
with the f-86 kabuki this one has like
this dome shape so it's really good for
getting up in there in the crease but
yeah sorry I'm nice I mean like I
totally just had a vasp you with you
guys on the nice comments thing because
I just don't want you to think we're
guys the whose page you live in a nice
coming on I didn't want you guys to
think that it it goes unnoticed because
it doesn't next I'll set all that with
my favorite translucent powder by Laura
Mercier and I'll be using another dome
shape brush this one is the tapered face
eat 20 RF 25 by Sigma I'm just going to
pack this on this is going to like help
to just give us that soft flawless
under-eye area and no creasing no crazy
business now go in with my Coco bronzer
more help me chocolate Soleil bronzer by
Too Faced and I'm just gonna pop this
all over my first
it's like to make sure to bronze up my
face really well because I believe
whenever I put on like so much highlight
and concealer and yada yada yada then it
kind of washes me out if you don't go
back in and like do some defining could
you just like your face and hit this
small eyeshadow brush just like this
knockoff name-brand even know what this
brush is I might have run a little bit
of this right down the nose never blow
in your makeup brushes or your eyeshadow
I mean or your eyelashes if you are
working on a client that was a hard rule
for me to learn cuz I'm a time we can
get gingivitis in your eye from going on
your eyelashes and I'm like honestly
like what to add some blush and my
current favorite blush has been mocha by
MAC Cosmetics I've had it for a long
time and forgot about it and now I'm
back to using it I've been loving using
this number eight brush from it
cosmetics however it is like way pricy
um but I just enjoy using my blush you
know use what if you're following this
look which I probably made it a little
bit difficult for you to follow the look
because I've been just chatting but if
you are you can use like whatever blush
brush I'm just saying like if you do buy
this you'll love it
before I was like on YouTube and in
beauty vlogger I every gift that I ever
got was a gift car to also Sephora no
matter what like if somebody got me
something different I would be like wine
using gilded honey from Lauren Geller
you can order this online at Ulta I know
everybody's having trouble finding it
but really it's just like on old Sue's
website and this is supposed to be like
the best thing ever
but this is the first time I've ever
used it so wrap that up alright so it is
so far living up to its reputation oh
now I just a little bit Cosmetics hello
lashes this is one of my favorite
mascaras I have a few favorite mascaras
I have some drugstore ones and some high
ends that are my faves but the it
cosmetics
hello lashes it's not even the formula
of the mascara I mean there's like fuzz
from my
or either cat hair or my hair I don't
know it's probably about to get all up
in my lashes but I don't even notice the
formula in the mascara is more so the
brush like the way they made this brush
just have been used and abused these are
Bambi by house lashes get all up in the
mirror to apply my lashes just saying
like the more you reuse your lashes the
easier they're already used because
they're like fit it to your eye word on
the street is the Rimmel one is a dupe
for this I would love to try I'm gonna
I'm gonna go buy it just to try it out
the see if that's true because this
stuff stays in your waterline
I mean $21 for inner rim liner is a lot
but if it works it works then go in with
a little bit more of let's see what
color I'll take is this a color we put
on the lid I'm just gonna blend that on
the lower lash line this brush is fully
loaded with dark color great this the
short or 8:20 I'm gonna take that
darkest color right here I'm going to
apply that right closer to the lower
lash line and now I'll add a little bit
of mascara using those hello lashes
mascara just to those lower lashes to
give them to like pop out once you're
done you're in a room liner like the
nude color I think like try to be very
careful not to touch the one on the
waterline just get a small mirror go in
and just have fun with it but lips I
think I'm going to try out spies I just
got this lip pencil from Mac and I'm
just gonna do the whole like lined the
outer part which is what you do with
eyeliner typically
nice I'm going to mix it with blankety
which is like this great Hopi dude
ah Spinelli's good old trusty mac fix+
right and here we have the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed this talkie talk
