in May
you
hey guys for this look I'm going to be
using my nume lustrum set and I'm
actually going to be using the skinniest
one it does come with five different
ones to choose from and it meant last
get ready with me I use the biggest one
so if you want to check that out you can
watch that video I'll link it down below
then you'll just pop it on and lock it
in and turn that bad boy on and you will
have your wand ready to go so I really
like the one because it has constant
heat so you're going to see how fast I'm
going to be able to do these curls
because I don't have to wait for it to
heat back up in between each and every
curl and my hair is pretty poufy just
because I washed it dried it and the
teller naturally is so hyper poufy hair
this one has six hundred percent more
negative ion technology and it helps to
make nice glossy curls rather than
crunchy curls so I don't have to like
round brush my hair or anything like
that before I use it I can actually just
let my hair air dry and then use it
because it's going to smooth out my hair
and I love the lustrum set because you
get a whole bunch of different wands you
get five different wants you can create
waves curls big's curls small curls and
they gave us a discount code so you can
get the full set for 98 plus the Argan
all with the discount code love Laura or
you can just get a single one for 39
bucks with the code Laura loves you so
super cute 2 sound codes but anyways
what I'm doing is using the tiny one
taking very small pieces of hair and
wrapping it around kinda like a ribbon
rather than twirling it around and I'm
just going to do this all over my head
this look was a little bit more
time-consuming just because I took
smaller pieces of hair but I love how
volume as the hair came out and in as
you can see my hair look how goofy it is
it just doesn't go too
they're wise my heart to be like that
anyways I will have everything I use in
this tutorial link in the description
box that be sure to check it out I love
you guys and thanks for being here
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
