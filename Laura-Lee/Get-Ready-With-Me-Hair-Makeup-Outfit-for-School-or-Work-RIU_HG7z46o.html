today's video is going to be very
exciting because I'm gonna be using the
tarte double duty beauty products that
are only at Ulta Beauty these are
absolutely perfect for beauty lovers on
the go in this video I'm going to show
you how I get ready really quick fast
and in a hurry and no false lashes so
starting out on me going in with the
empowered hybrid gel foundation this is
a full coverage foundation which also
has skincare ingredients within it to
help moisturize the skin blur fine lines
and wrinkles as well as smooth out those
pores I'm buffing this and with a brush
that is sold separately at Ulta and it
has a little scoop II to apply the
product to your face with and scoop it
out of its jar and this pretty much
leaves a nice flawless finish now we'll
move on to the double duty powder I'm
just gonna apply this foundation powder
around the foundation just to lock it in
and set everything that way we make sure
that it lasts all day long next up is
the eyes we're gonna be using the double
duty Beauty eye and cheek count for this
first I'm going in with ladies night and
I'm just gonna blend this all over the
lid with an e forty brush just to soften
up any eye primer that I have down this
is just a great transition shade as well
this is a super cute palette it has five
different eyeshadows as well as a blush
that you will see me use in just a
minute next I'm gonna be going in with
Twilight which is a topi bobbi brown
color I'm just gonna pop that into the
outer corner of the eye and blend it
into the crease this is just gonna give
us a slight bit of dimension
as far as my eyelids I'm gonna be using
the IR key tech and I said to go in with
bronze gold they have a cup of couple of
different shades I just put the powder
side on my lid and then what you can
actually do is pop off the other side
and it becomes an eyeliner so it's like
a two-in-one and I'm just going to go
ahead and tightline that way it my lash
just looked fuller because I'm not gonna
be wearing any false lashes in this
tutorial crazy I know right then I'm
gonna be going in with the lights camera
lashes double into mascara one in is for
your upper lashes and the other n is for
your lower lashes easy peasy lemon
squeezy so you just need one mascara I'm
just gonna pop this all over my lashes
and then I'm gonna pop off the other end
and apply it to these lower lashes the
other end has a very teeny tiny one
you'll see just in a second and it's
perfect to coat those lower lashes and
mascara and not get the mascara
absolutely everywhere you can see that
I'm doing right here next up to add a
pinch of color to my cheeks I'm new
grabbing the blush out of the palette
and just popping that on to the apples
of the cheeks for the lips I want to be
using the lips kultur it is a
double-ended lipstick and lip gloss so
I'm using the shade basic which is a
pretty peachy pink color first I applied
the lipstick and then I'm gonna pop on
that gloss and just so you guys know
these products launched on altas website
on February the 21st and in store on
March 13th so mark your calendars we are
done with our makeup this is the final
look I hope you like it and now I'm
gonna show you a cool hair tutorial to
do whenever you're in a hurry first what
you want to do is part your hair on
whichever side you prefer and then put
it in a side ponytail pretty easy it
gets a little bit more complicated but I
promise this hair so super cute and I
also showed you guys this hairstyle in
my hair hacks if you saw that video so
you're gonna split the hair in two parts
the front part you're gonna tie it in a
little rubber band and pull the hair
through kind of like a Topsy tail I
don't know if you remember those from
the 90s then you're gonna take the next
part and do the exact same thing
basically repeat itself all the way down
the hair until you have this really odd
fishtail looking braid this is what I
like to call the bubble braid and I know
it doesn't look bubbly yet but it will
so you'll tie off the end and this is
the trick you start pulling the hair
gently you don't want to pull too much
hair and then you create this really fat
looking Bree
it makes you look like you have tons of
hair but really it's just the way the
hair is looped through and pulled out
absolutely love this hairstyle and it
seriously takes me minutes to create
hope you guys enjoyed the video I love
you guys thank you so much for being
here and I hope to see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
