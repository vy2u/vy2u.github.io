video is going to be a get ready with me
it's been so long since I've done with
these and I'm going to be testing out
the new tarp makeup you guys have been
wanting to see this stuff in action and
today I'm going to be using it for you
and also I'm gonna be chit-chatting with
you a little bit hopefully through doing
my makeup I will be answering some my
most asked questions on YouTube that we
for those of you who don't know me very
well you can get to know me a little bit
because I know I don't do a lot of q and
A's and things like that so I thought we
kind of cool to incorporate throw and
makeup tutorial so I'll be chit-chatting
and if you want to get your makeup out
at home and do your makeup and get ready
with me it could be fun we could do it
together this video is probably gonna be
pretty long so grab a snack grab a
friend your grandma your dog your cat
your boyfriend and let's get ready
together you also be sure to subscribe
to my channel before you leave first I
want to start with my Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre and carve out my eyebrows I'm
going to be using the new sigma e60 2
brush
in order to do this I look down along
this area in my videos and it's because
I don't have autofocus and if I move
back I'm out of focus I'm constantly
looking at my viewfinder to try and make
sure I stay in focus and that's what I'm
doing I get a lot I don't actually get a
lot of comments about that but I notice
I do it and so that's what's going on
and I'm trying really hard not to do
that anymore so we're going to do the
eye brows I've already drawn my eyebrows
on I'll do an updated browser toriel if
you guys want to see that let me know
down in the comment section after I do
my eyebrows I like to use this Paint Pot
for two things to prime my eyelids of
course and then it like carves out and
cleans up the eyebrow as well alright
next I'm going to go ahead and do my
foundation I don't know why this is the
routine that I always do my makeup in
but it is and I'm going to be using the
Tarte this is the clean slate timeless
primer I've been using this stuff
forever it's like one of my favorite
facial primers if you try it you have
texture on your skin you'll love this
stuff you have a purple lid now it has a
gold lid it smells so good and I
just get a little bit out and then I
work it into areas that pores are a
little bit more prominent because I
don't want them flashing around and
showing up so then I'm going to be using
this foundation from Urban Decay and I'm
so extra and I feel so like annoying
even saying this but I mix these two
together the Marc Jacobs remarkable and
the all-nighter by urban decay and it
becomes this flawless concoction of
makeup like guys I'm so weird like if
you meet me in person and we hang out
like it's not the right lid but if you
met me in person we hang out like I'm
different okay
I'm gonna be taking this Sigma f80 to
kabuki and I'm going to blend it in the
foundation and start to stipple it on my
face while I'm blending this in I'm
going to go ahead and answer one of my
most asked questions which is what is
your race or background it's been asking
a lot of different questions but I'll
tell you actually my great-great-grandma
is a full Native American Indian I don't
know what tribe because I've been lazy
and I haven't like looked into it
but that is where I get my dark eyes and
my tan skin kind of tan skin it's not
like super tan but um you know and the
dark hair and all and then I don't know
honestly what else I am mixed with I
don't know I haven't done research I'm
just living like things like my
ethnicity I've never been like I don't
know like a huge part of like Who I am
I'm just Laura and I don't know I don't
want to say it doesn't matter to me but
she's never been a huge part of my life
like I think everybody's different and
we're almost so special let me just say
that you're all so special and we're all
so different my birth certificate says
Caucasian though I can tell you that so
there is the first major question answer
for you guys all right we'll move on to
high shot so today I'm going to be using
the tar Diaz pro palette it's like a
bunch of matte shades and then you get
four duo chrome shades I don't know what
make it look I want to do I don't want
to do like the same look over and over
again I want to do something different
but first I go ahead
we will start off with a cream color to
soften up we'll go with this cream color
called classic this is the e30 eight
brush this is the diffuse crease I'm
just gonna soften up that out I should a
primer mix everything else way easier to
blend my next question I get asked all
the time well let me grab my next shade
so I can people indignant in the
meantime I'm gonna grab bold with the
same brush Laura and I know you guys are
gonna be like holy she's finally
answering it why don't you ever wear
your wedding ring are you still married
guys let me just say this just with him
a woman doesn't have on her ring for
like five minutes doesn't mean she's not
married you know don't make accusations
like that I am still married I've
actually never really wore my wedding
ring in YouTube videos and it's because
my ring a it gets in the way it's it's
it's up kind of high so makeup gets in
it even if I'm not doing my makeup I
don't know I feel like and I know I'm so
weird but let me be me everybody's
different I feel like my wedding ring is
like this is so weird but it's like a
personal thing and it's not something I
like - like flaunt into the world I just
like to keep my wedding ring to myself
so me and I go out or go to an event or
something I always have it on but I
don't know I'm just weird about it I
don't really have like a specific reason
why I don't have it on in my videos I
just don't wear it in my youtube videos
it's like a little precious gym that I
have and I like to keep it for myself
you know I don't know I'm weird about it
so I don't wear my youtube videos don't
really have a specific answer for you I
wish I did but like I said I am a
different little creature so I just
don't also another thing about me
whenever I talk a lot like I'm doing
this video my voice always gets
whimpering because I don't breathe a lot
when I talk it's like and it's something
I'm about to cry or like I'm nervous
it's not the case it just means I need
to take deep breaths and breathe next
I'm going to take edgy which is a darker
brown color this is an e25 brush from
Sigma it's called a blending brush and
is my favorite brush in the whole wide
world if you even follow my channel you
already know that so then I'm going to
blend this color in the crease and
keeping it up kind of high so answer
another question I see in my comic
section all the time and it's Laura
weary from is it Texas and no I am NOT
from Texas is so weird like whenever
people here is at wine or somewhat of a
country accent they immediately ask me
am i from Texas like no I'm from
cultures and actually all my friends I
know from Texas don't have a country
accent at all so Texas is like really
Western - kinda I'm from the dirty dirty
south I'm from Alabama
that's like southern yeah I'm from
Alabama and I moved to California almost
three years ago not really I would say
like two and a half years ago I moved to
California Los Angeles to be exact I
rarely use the shade purple I just I
don't know I don't wear it a lot but
today I'm going to so I want to mix it
up a little bit I'm gonna take a bit of
the shade drama on my 825 brush the
blending brush that I learned I'm just
gonna like kind of make this look like a
little bit of a purple hue to it by
blending it right into my crease my
overall review of this palette I like it
I think it's one of tarts best eyeshadow
palettes the colors blend out really
nicely I mean as you can see on my eye
like they diffuse out really nicely like
you don't have to fight them and then
sometimes when colors like blend too
easily like they start to disappear as
you blend them out but these clearly
have a lot of pigmentation left and I'm
still after you blended them out so I'm
basically focusing these colors on my
crease and kind of avoiding my eyelid
area of exam put one of the pretty
duochrome colors on my eyelid now I'm
going to go in with glam which I've
never used this color before it's like
very pretty and champagne like I frickin
love it and I apply it to my eyelid to
do this I'm going to be using the i50
six this is the lid or shader brush it's
really great for applying color to your
eyelid and I'm going to spritz it with a
little bit of mac fix+ because i love
anytime i use a shimmery color just to
enhance
a little bit with mac fix+ it's just my
thing Oh golly now you don't actually
have to wet these I just do to get like
max pigmentation and I live on so now
just because I want a little bit more
purple love I'm going to go back in with
drama in the e25 brush and I'm just
going to sharpen up that grease that
looks so pretty okay guys if you see a
lot of Fallout on the sides of my eye
not fallout but like a lot of mess will
clean it up after we do our winged liner
which is what we're going to do now for
that I'm using my handy dandy NYC liquid
liner and this stuff is so affordable
it's like $2 at the drugstore
when in doubt wine get out and there's
my winged liner and see all this mess
outside here we will wipe away with a
makeup remover wipe I'm gonna grab one
my ELF makeup removing wipes which
honestly these are like some of my
favorite makeup removing wipes and
they're so affordable so good I'm
missing a thumbnail to anyone else
notice that that looks so much better
alright now I'm gonna go ahead and do my
lashes I want are you applying the Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara one of my
favorite mascaras you can actually get
this at Ulta sometimes for like 10
dollars whenever they do their 21 days
of beauty and only goes on sale so
another question you guys always ask me
is the gray hairs you see a few of them
hanging out up there well a lot of
people ask is that way here as I see and
my answer to your question is yes that's
great here's you see my hair started
growing pretty noticeably whenever I was
16 and now I am a little more than
salt-and-pepper like I would say the
vast majority of my head
is gray all right dude I my roots every
now and again it's just like I have so
much gray hair and I'm so like I swear
to you I know you guys are like BS
you're not that busy but I swear to you
guys so busy I promise you like I'm
balls to the walls and I don't have time
to sit in a salon so I dye my own roots
like I touched them up with like the
gray hair dye like gray cover hair dye
and so some still peek through I don't
hate my gray hair it just is a lot
because it's like brown all the way to
ombre and there's gray so there's like a
lot of color going on my hair which is
dark I probably went die um and just
wouldn't brights them because I've
embraced him from majority of my life
into ion braids my hair and then it was
just like too much happening like it was
just like it looked unkept rather than
me embracing it so then I started
covering it which is a never-ending job
and it sucks because I started so young
I'm sure some of you out there have
experienced the same thing if you can't
embrace it embrace it I embraced it from
like 16 to 25 embrace it in the past
like two years I started covering them
just because like I said whenever you
have like like all these different
blondes and like this brown and then
gray it's just like a lot happening by
the way my favorite thing in high school
would be when people walk up to me be
like oh did you know you had gray hair
and I'd be like what yeah I know I saw
on it yeah next up is Alanis you're like
you just add a mascara but you guys know
I'm gonna add the drama and put on these
I mean these are freaking gorgeous there
by icon lashes I'll have a link down
below because I don't know like the
exact name of them by the way if you're
like not into knowing about me or don't
like the Q&amp;amp;A part what you to do is keep
skipping through the video as I know if
people are gonna complain it's too long
so just skip through the parts that you
don't want to hear another question I
get asked all the time is how is my
Invisalign going and yes I'm doing
Invisalign and these teeth look and
sanely better if you watch my older
videos hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be my teeth
were a lot more crooked so I did
Invisalign alright I'm doing a design
I'm halfway through montre well I just
started try 16 of 30 and my teeth have
dramatically changed
it's a really great thing and I'm really
happy with my results so far I do
experience soreness for sure but it's
going good it here's to these little
hooks a little dot to my teeth that's
for the Invisalign it like gives him is
line something to pull the teeth back I
had Dennis tell me that I wasn't a
candidate for Invisalign on how to have
braces and they wanted to remove teeth
all my extra teeth not extra teeth make
more room in my mouth and I was just
like completely opposed to that I was
like that's and you're not
taking out good teeth that I have in my
mouth just for straightening out my
teeth like no and so then I found a
dentist who was like you're an absolute
candidate from visit line and it's been
a great experience and only halfway
through my teeth have dramatically
changed I know they're so crooked but
it's just changed them so much is even
changed my face shape a little bit
because it's made like my jaw widen out
it just looks better like everything I'm
just so happy with it I'll put my
dentist down in the description box down
below if you're local to the LA area but
she's so awesome okay so next I'm going
to use the sharp just sharp I just said
sharp next I'm going to use the tart
shape tape concealer this is always sold
out I know because it's the best
concealer ever but you can get unlike
ulties email lists and I'll email you
when it's back I'm using shade
light/medium and my camera stopped
recording that points already on my face
I was talking about my teeth and dentist
and I don't know if it coming off but I
was expressing to you guys if you ever
you know want to look into straightening
your teeth or having work done get other
opinions than just one don't go to just
one dentists I would like go around and
get opinions
that's just my advice to you guys now
men take it f-86 kabuki from sigma and a
little bit of yellow setting powder I'm
just going to press it into the
concealer while that's setting I'm going
to jump in and use the tar Diaz pro
globe palette I've been using this a bit
and I really like it
today I'm going to be using the powder
shade sculpt to carve out my cheekbones
and to contour with but they have four
highlighters in and then a cream contour
I'm not really in like
cuantos kind of filled today so I'm just
going to be using school to do a powder
contour which is a little bit lighter
I'm just going to take a little bit on
my fo5 brush from Sigma and I'm going to
start carving on the cheekbones another
question I get asked a lot is how long
have me and Tyler been together and
we've been together I think it's over
I think this February will be nine years
I think it might be eight anyways it's
been a really long time and that is
eight straight years no breakups or
anything like that ty is my husband he's
a really nice guy like super sweet I
promise you and um most wives after you
know that long would be like he's a
shithead but I just like a really
genuinely sweet person and we've met our
senior year in high school and we
started dating and we just never broke
love I've been really happy in my
relationship with him it's been just a
really I've had bad relationships in the
past and I'm glad they're water under
the bridge but I just been really happy
in my relationship with him
he's such genuinely a good-hearted
person and I think that's what really
makes it work because just know I'm
crazy like not in like an arguing or
like throwing stuff away but like I'm
just a little kooky in my own way I'm
loud I'm all over the place and he's so
settled down and he's opposite of me
we're opposites now I'm going to take my
f40 brush and I'm just going to dust
away the excess powder that is left next
I'm going to take this blush from Revlon
this is called RACI rose and with the
f23 brush I'm going to pop it on to my
cheeks it's some really pretty it's kind
of glowy I'm going to go back to the
TARDIS globe palette and I'm gonna mix
together stunner and lit this is an/fo
six brush
just going to apply that to the upper
cheekbone area to give us a nice clothes
super pretty
alright now we're to go back to the
TARDIS Pro I should have pellets I'm
going to finish the under eye area I
have an itch I'm not picking my nose
from my under eye area I'm actually
going to take edgy which is this brown
color I'm going to blend it from inner
to outer corner it's kind of darker
that's all whoops
and then I'm going to take minx which is
this pretty duochrome color by the way
this is a e57 brush I'm just going to
blend this right on top I'm going to go
back in with glam I'm going to pop it
into the inner corners now I'm going to
take this liner from Estee edit I'm not
this to edit Estee Lauder X Victoria
Beckham I'm going to take the dark side
which is black and just apply it to the
waterline and we're going to go back in
with that tart mascara and add it to my
lower lashes another question I get
asked a lot is a my only child or do our
brothers and sisters and yes I have an
older brother and an older sister and
they live in Alabama and I'm the
youngest I'm the baby of the family my
mom loved me the most just kidding kind
of my whole family lives in Alabama my
parents are divorced they divorced
whenever I was 16 years old it was a
good thing wasn't like a bad divorce
like oh I'm sad I divorce it was like a
good thing they it was time to and I
won't go into detail on that but
honestly I don't have that much of a
relationship with my dad and I have a
really great relationship with my mom
sister and brother and I talk to them
all the time and I love them to death
and I go back to Alabama if you hold me
on snapchat like you already know a lot
of this stuff but um I go back to
Alabama and visit them a lot and a lot
next I'm gonna line my lips with this
makeup forever this is the in 21 they
came out with a bunch of pretty nudey
pink colors I'm gonna line my lips with
this first people legit ask me all the
time do you miss Alabama and
uh I lived in Alabama for a long time so
I don't I don't miss Alabama I do miss
my friends and family from Alabama but I
don't I just I don't miss Alabama I
don't know it was like I was there long
enough like I get it it was time to move
on you know and and I definitely don't
want to live there my whole life and I
was able to move to California and
luckily and Here I am and I love
California I love Los Angeles it's such
a great diverse city and you meet people
from all over the world all over the
country all different aspects of life
here and you learn so much about
yourself and other people out here I am
obsessed with Los Angeles is such a
great city yes for my lips I'm are using
the tardis lip paint and bestie so this
one is different from their this is
their new lip paint their other one was
kind of like a whipped lippy where I
didn't dry completely these do these are
like liquid lipstick once are pretty and
one last question I get asked all the
time have you had lip fillers and yes
have a head lip fillers recently no I
probably had him like two or three
months ago I am done by Dr Kaplan MD yes
he is the doctor who created the brand
Kaplan MD that's at Sephora and my
experience was really good I actually
had a couple of times but probably need
to get a touch-up sometime soon because
lip filler for those of you don't know
it doesn't last forever
it goes away the more you get the longer
at last but the less you get it's just
it goes away so yes I keep getting it
touched up so I probably need to do a
touch-up sometime soon some people in my
last video were asking me about it and
I'm like no I mean I haven't gotten lip
filler in like three months but okay
this eyes watering and it's playing a
game alright guys so that is it for this
video thank you so much for getting
ready with me I hope the Q&amp;amp;A answered
some questions about me I love you guys
thank you for being here and watching
I'll have everything I use listed in the
description box down below and I'll see
you on my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
