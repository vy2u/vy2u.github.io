video is going to be a makeup tutorial
for oily skin if you have promised your
makeup moving around not lasting very
long you have oily skin and your like we
have to do something with this okay I
got you covered
okay today's tutorial is great for that
and not only that I think today's
tutorial is great for a date night look
a little fancy wedding you have to
attend you know you're gonna see your
ex-boyfriend out and you want to look
Slade
well honey you have come to the right
place also in today's tutorial I'm gonna
teach you how to cover some zits or
unwanted areas because I got some
friends hanging around and I'm gonna
show you how to make them kind of go
away well cover them up nicely I am
going to be using the Born This Way
concealer by Too Faced this is their
brand new to concealer they just came
out with which I am so excited about
because I've been using it non-stop most
of you already know that who follow me I
think is amazing is all free ad so many
high hopes when this came up because I
love the foundation so much by them then
I was like this concealer has to be
bomb-diggity and it absolutely is the
best it is an amazing job covering it
hydrates the skin but not too much it
brightens the skin and it also blends
out super easily I use the shade light
for my under eye and I used to shade
medium right here to cover well you know
anyways we're gonna jump right in and
get started if you haven't subscribed to
my channel yet well you should okay okay
now we are officially gonna jump right
in and get started let's do it starting
out I like to prime my skin if you have
Olli skin sometimes you have big pores
not all the times but sometimes I have a
little bit of a poor showing issue
through here so I like to use the pore
minimizing primer by Smashbox I'll take
just a little dab of it and really just
kind of press it into those areas
there's not really a need to apply this
all over your face just in areas to give
you a little more trouble especially
with texture also this one is a really
lightweight silicon based primer so it's
not going to make your skin oily or feel
heavy or greasy or any
that jazz / foundation I'm going to be
using the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation this is one that I count on
if I'm going to be in a hot area or in
at an event or have to wear put a long
time this is a nice long wearing
foundation and the best part about it is
it's all free so you definitely want to
look for an old free foundation if you
were having problems with breakouts or
you know you get greasy easy Aubry is
the way to go I'm just going to take
this our teeth brush this one is an
oval-8 and I'm just going to smooth this
out on my skin so what I'm going to do
now is cover a couple of things ask some
friends on my face that we're not
invited to the party but they showed up
anyways I'm going to be taking the one
this way concealer this one is in oil
free concealer so it is great for oily
skin but at the same time it is a bit
hydrating so it's not going to dry out
your skin or get cakey or flakey that
rhymed and I did not mean for it to so
I'm going to take the shade medium which
is like the color of my actual skin tone
and I'm just going to apply a little bit
over my friends I don't know why I'm
calling them friends because they're not
very friendly in my opinion
and then I'm just gonna dab it out you
don't want to use the concealer that is
a lighter shade when trying to cover
things but you do want to use a
concealer there's a lot of shade
whenever you want to highlight your face
which is what we're gonna do next I
think it covers so good but at the same
time it doesn't get greasy or move
around or sloshy on the skin or patchy
it just works out really well and you'll
see how easy it blends out so I'm going
to use the shade light I typically go
one to two shades lighter than my
foundation shade when I'm trying to
highlight my skin these are the areas
that I typically like to highlight and
you'll see how smooth that looks once I
blend it all out I'm just using the same
brush just to very lightly blend it out
voila it's so easy and my skin is Olli I
typically don't like to use a beauty
blender because pressing the wet or damp
Beauty Blender into the skin can retain
moisture into your skin a little bit of
moisture that you might not need you can
brush it away like it's a hairbrush a
great trick to make your makeup not get
greasy oily or slick away until
last longer is to set it this part is so
important what I like to use is this
overall control pressed powder like how
perfect is that this actually came in my
June boxycharm what I like to do is take
my big powder brush and press it into
the powder like this I do get a good fit
and then I'll literally just press into
my skin you can either press it all over
your face like I'm going to do today to
make sure everything's locked and loaded
or you can just press it into areas to
get oily very easily and this will help
control that next I'm going to add a
little bit of bronzer to the skin I'm
just going to use this angled bronzing
brush this is an e4 from morphe and my
Laura Mercier bronzer this one is bronze
oh - so I like to use a powder bronzer
especially if I'm dealing with old
because I'm telling you cream contour is
a little bit of heavy makeup and just
applying that much make it to your face
on top of trying to control the whole
issue can be a mess it's just less
makeup on your skin and then you would
have to go in and set the cream with a
powder anyway so it's just a lot of
makeup and we're trying to control oil
and make everything shine free so this
is the best method to do that and I'm
just going to apply this right
underneath the cheekbone swiping back
and forth and then I'm going to dabble
it on the temples area where the Sun
actually hits my skin and then I'm going
to contour my nose was a little bit more
of a smaller precise brush that way the
powder doesn't go everywhere for blush
I'm going to be using this Tarte clay
blush palette their blushes are made to
last normally blush is the first thing
to go whenever you're dealing with Oly
skin so I'm going to take a little bit
of laughs which is this shade right
there I like to tap off the excess
because I don't want to like flake and
fall out on my face but this blush is
made to last longer so I like to go to
my clay blushes from Tarte just add a
little bit of color to the cheek and
just to make sure it's gonna last a bit
longer and for my highlight just to
things don't get too crazy or greasy I'm
going to keep the highlight right here
and a little bit on the nose but I want
to make sure and keep it away from in
the area that gets Oly or greasy I'm
gonna definitely keep it away from this
area right here I'm going to take a
little bit on my brush and just make
sure and just keep it right there and
leave it at that if this is one of your
areas that gets Oly
easy I would skip this part that it's
still on fleek now that we have the face
done I actually like to go ahead and set
it while we work on the eyes what I like
to use is the best
oil control and long-lasting makeup it's
the all nighter setting spray by Urban
Decay is so good what I like to do is
take this Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre I
find that this one works so well to
prime the eyelids if you have Olli
eyelids on the eyes I'm going to use in
my palette I create it with violet
laughs isn't she lovely I'll be taking
Priss pot which is a warmer tone orangie
color I'm just going crazy with it on
this blending brush and I like to soften
up the eye primer because like I
mentioned before it's super tacky so I
gotta just blend this all over this is
something I do in every tutorial and you
guys are probably tired of it next I'm
going to go in with my favorite
transition shade in the whole wide world
this is Britches it's such a great tan
color and again I'm just gonna blend
that right into the crease next shade
I'm going to go in with is Alabama I'm
just going to take a very small amount
of this shade on this e 25 brush I'm
going to be sure to be a little bit more
precise with it now moving it around too
much but taking it in the upper crease
area trying to avoid the eyelid and then
I just make sure and blend out all the
edges and make sure it's very soft for
the next part I'm going to take a
smaller brush and get a little bit even
more precise and I go in with bubs and
whiskers and just mix them together
these are just two dark brown shades I'm
only going to keep these shades on the
outer corner of the eye
little pencil brushes are great for
detail work like this and I'm just going
to kind of keep it really low pressed in
that inner corner and move it around
very small motions I'm not swiping
really big I'm just keeping it very
detailed and small we're going to go
even darker in that outer corner and add
loo this part can be a little bit scary
because the color is like really dark
and then take it and apply it right on
top of bubs and whiskers the dark brown
color that we added to the outer corner
just really deepen it up and smoke it
out a little bit but being very careful
not to take the color too high first I'm
going to go in with hissy-fit this shade
right here this is a golden bronze shade
it's so pretty I I love it ma mine and
I'm taking this tiny brush I'm going to
just start packing it onto the lid and
teeny tiny motions like this and then
right in the center I start to buff the
color a little bit over the black that
way its gradient right there and there's
not like a harsh line where one color
starts and one color stops I'm going to
add just a touch of this flaky shade
right here on top of hissy fit and
lastly I'm going to go in with a little
bit of sugar sugar mama just sugar but I
my eyes sugar to the brow bone and this
is just going to tie the whole look
together it's also going to give us a
little lift and a little drama on the
brow bone I'm going to add some winged
liner now I love the drama of the winged
liner I have a full dedicated tutorial
to this though I will be right back
how annoying is it when mascara decides
to run away and you're like get back
here I tell you to go anywhere so I like
to use waterproof mascara especially if
it's gonna be like a hot sweaty day I am
gonna be adding some false lashes from
flutter lashes because I love the drama
now we're gonna finish up by working on
the under eyes I'm going to go back in
with breeches the grid is transition
shade over I'm just going to blend that
with a fluffy brush back and forth like
a windshield wiper to the lower lash
line now I'll go in with a little bit of
Lou and smoke it out and make it like
sensual dark and smoky I am going to be
using a smaller more defining brush to
do this
and then I'll grab a little bit of
Alabama and apply it right underneath
loo to make it more transitioned and
softer then I'm going to take my
favorite eyeliner for the waterline
because this liner does not budge and
this is gonna be the Marc Jacobs liner
this is their high liner black lacquer
crayon and no this one's called blacker
what is this I don't even know what this
is it's just good okay I will link it
down below we're gonna add a little bit
of our trusty better than sex mascara to
the lower lash line now I'm going to
line my lips which helps make the
lipstick last so much longer with
stripped down by Mac by line my lips I
mean I'm going to over line my lips I
can't help it I have to then I'm gonna
take a little bit of sand from dose of
colors this is a nude liquid lipstick
and I'm going to apply it to the center
and then blend it out and lastly one of
the most important steps is to set my
gob so I'm going to be taking I'm gonna
cave all nighter setting spray and just
make sure everything's like intact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
