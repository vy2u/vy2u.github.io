video is going to be this super glittery
New Year's Eve look I absolutely love it
and we're gonna jump right in and get
started and don't forget to give the
video a thumbs up if you do enjoy it
starting out we're just gonna jump right
in with this foundation this is the
Becca brand new aqua luminous perfecting
foundation and I already primed my face
with a little bit of facial primer I'll
link down below so this is the first
time of me using this foundation and I
liked it a lot however I did you shade
medium which was a tad bit too dark for
me so I'm going to have to bump up to
the shade natural but I've been wearing
the foundation all day and it looks
absolutely stunning on the skin my face
looks really wet and moistured because I
added a moisturizing primer underneath
because I'm dealing with some major dry
skin issues this winter then I went in
with frappe from makeup geek and I
started blending that in the crease as
my transition shade I use my e 25 brush
from Sigma and I used this brush in
every tutorial basically all tutorial
along then I mixed together cocoa bear
and bitten by makeup geek and I blended
these kind of in the outer corner and
then I took whatever was left on the
brush and I moved it into the crease in
the inner corner and then I just took it
and switched it around to make sure
everything was blended out if you notice
I'm using a super light hand and
blending things out really soft and
that's what gives you that nice gradient
blend it out look if you ever feel like
you're getting choppy and you can't get
it blended out enough try blending for a
longer time with a softer hand so also
what I like to do is go in with a big
fluffy brush and just soften up any
rough edges especially whenever we're
dealing with bright colors like that
radish color that mine going with
americano which is the come with my
favorite matte brown color from makeup
geek again using the 825 the same brush
you know your girl is just not gonna
switch it up I'm gonna pop that right on
top of where I pop the other colors I'm
gonna push it into the inner corner and
just start blending it out and
whatever's left on the brush
I'm gonna blend it in the crease in the
inner corner then I took corrupt and
this color from honest Oscar Beverly
Hills I'll link it down below because I
can't remember the name of it off the
top of my head what else is new and I'm
just gonna keep building up color you
don't have to add this many colors if
you don't want to I just like pro look
to look really gradient just to have
like a whole bunch of colors building it
up with the darker and darker colors and
smoking it out that's just my preference
and makeup but you don't have to get
this extreme with it if you don't want
to but I'm doing the exact same thing
I'm blending it in the outer corner and
taking what's left on the brush and
blending it into the inner corner and
crease and of course we'll just take a
fluffy brush of any sort and soften it
up my favorite part
taking motives of Speyer aspire glitter
and I pop this right into the center of
the lid and I worked it a little bit
inward with a flat synthetic brush and I
did have a glitter primer right on top
of my lid as you can see my other little
shiny so else makes a really great one
and to face did I use one from a violet
Voss which was awesome but you don't
have to use it as that same one as me
I'm just throwing out some options then
I'm going in with the Tarte lights
camera flashes and basically I'm just
trying to cut my lashes with one quick
coat that way they will mix in well with
my falsies cuz you know yeah girl let
that drama
okay I'll quit singing now my favorite
part of this tutorial is the false
lashes mostly because I get to do this
with them I'm going it with a whoo
beauty Alena number 10 lashes you can
buy these at Sephora that's where I
bought mine I'm gonna pop those on I
like doing super dramatic lashes
well basically everyday but especially
whenever I'm not going to be wearing an
eyeliner now I'll go in with my naked
concealer by urban decay and I'm gonna
highlight the face for some reason I
thought it would be cool to me spider
legs I don't know I love it and then I'm
going in with my Bobbi Brown foundation
stick and I'm gonna contour the face I
have a full cream contour video on my
channel I have like a bunch of them
honestly cuz it's like my favorite
contour Matt
it and I love breaking it down for you
guys so if you search that on my channel
you will find those videos and basically
I'm just gonna put it in areas that need
to be darkened and then I'm gonna blend
that out with this chisel contour brush
from Sigma Beauty I did this in fast
mode because again if you want like a
really broken down version of this then
go to that video but cream contouring is
amazing for night makeup and most the
time on New Year's Eve you're going down
at nighttime you guys be safe anyways
I'm just gonna blend all that out and
then I'll take a clean kabuki just to
soften it up a bit and then I'm gonna
take a dump shake kabuki and I'm gonna
push in the highlight into the skin and
then I'll also do a little bit of
swiping it to blend it out now let me be
real with you for just a minute and let
you know on my wall my right your left a
forehead temple area you'll see a patch
of brown and I didn't get to blend out
the freakin contour very well I looked
at it afterwards and I was like darn it
Laura anyways what I'm doing now is
going in with my favorite Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and I'm
pushing it into the areas that we
highlighted and then I'm gonna let it
sat on my face for like five to seven to
ten minutes and then I will blend it all
off and this made it look so flawless so
matte so gorgeous it just made the look
in my opinion I'm just gonna take this
fluffy doll J shaped brush you can use a
powder brush and dust away the excess
powder oh look at this palette so I'm
gonna go in with baby love which is this
is ma B blush color I'm gonna pop that
onto the apples of the cheeks this is
where you could especially see where I
didn't blend that contour good it's
killing me and then I'm gonna go in with
what's up I benefit and pop this on to a
few areas strobe a little and I'll blend
that out with this little Real
Techniques drugstore our brush and just
to soften all that cream color out I
love cream everything except for cream
blush I'm not a big fan of cream blush I
don't know what I'm telling you all this
I just feel like I should
once that was all finished I went in
with stripped down by Mack and lined my
lips and then I went in with a violet
Voss liquid lipstick which was a nice
nude color and applied it in the center
real quick let me just let you know that
I completely brought to hit record while
I was adding mascara to the lower lashes
so I did take a little bit of cocoa bear
the warm brown color added it to the
lower lashes and then I just popped on
some mascara and I didn't do any liner
in the waterline just because the
eyeshadow was so dramatic it was just
not necessary but do you boo
do as you please take what you want from
this tutorial I truly hope you enjoyed
it if you did please give it a thumbs up
