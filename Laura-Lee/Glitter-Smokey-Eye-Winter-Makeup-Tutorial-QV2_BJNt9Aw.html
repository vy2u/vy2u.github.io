already knows that my love is fine
his heart was a stone the dance hands
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be this makeup look
that I'm wearing right here obviously
was wearing this look on snapchat my
snapchat family was like girl they gave
me death threats they were like you
better recreate and I appreciate those
death threats because I appreciate you
guys requesting looks from me it's very
flattering to me whenever you guys
request to see me recreate what I'm just
wearing so thank you for that and here's
the look for you guys also I just wanted
to say very quickly that I have my 500k
giveaway going giving away lots of good
makeup and different prizes so be sure
to enter that we'll have it linked down
below as well as the end date for the
giveaway we're going to jump right in
and get started we are not gonna chit
chat too much so let's get started oh
and don't forget to give me that thumbs
up if you do enjoy don't be stingy first
what I'm going to do is I'll go in and
pry my skin this is what I do always
before I start my foundation and today
I'm using the timeless Tarte primer this
is a smoothing balm primer and I just
put it in areas to need a little bit
more help smoothing out right where my
pores are a little bit larger they
aren't larger on my forehead but it is a
mattifying primer so it does help the
skin to look a little bit more matte
then I'm going to go in with the Makeup
Forever HD Ultra HD stick foundation I
really like this stick foundation this
is the only stick foundation I have ever
liked in my life and it blends out super
easy as you're going to be able to see
while in this tutorial and I'm using an
80 brush whenever I use this take
validation I automatically think goopy
thick cake makeup but not the case with
this one now I will go in with the first
shade which is creme brulee by makeup
geek in ie 25 Alyssa def e 25 brush from
Sigma I will be using this brush
throughout the whole entire tutorial I'm
going to blend this in the crease as you
can see this is going to be our
transition shade it just helps all the
other colors blend out so easy peasy
lemon squeezy
our next shade is going to be frappe by
makeup geek same brush what I like to do
is pop this right on top of creme brulee
so the trick with this tutorial is to
really build up color and that way you
get that soft gradient look and that is
exactly what I'm going to be doing so I
do use quite a few different colors in
this tutorial but the outcome is
gorgeous
then next shade I'm going to be going in
with my favorite shade for makeup geek
this is Coco bear and this is a nice
warm brown so I like to focus most of
this color on the outer edge and then
whatever's left on my brush I start to
blend it forward and then I take a lot
of extra time to make sure that outer
corner is really soft because we don't
want any harsh lines or like clumpiness
in our eye makeup now for the next color
we're going in with cherry cola this is
a new color for makeup geek which I
adore it looks scary because it is like
a maroon e purpley reddish color but
once it's all blended out with browns it
really just gives a little bit of hint
of color to the look and not make it
also brownie if you get what I'm saying
so I'm doing the exact same thing I'm
blending it in the outer corner mostly
and then whatever's left on my e25 brush
I'm gonna push it forward because this
is a darker color I'm gonna go in with
my a footie blending brush and soften
everything up and poke myself in the eye
now I'm gonna go in with another color
from makeup eat that's newer I think
this is called americo americano
I don't know but it's the dark brown
color and it's really pretty so again
I'm doing the exact same thing I'm
focusing majority of the color on the
outer corner and then blending forward
that way we don't have super dark color
in that inner corner of the eye and it
doesn't look too patchy now I'm going in
with a little bit of Urban Decay primer
for my eyelids and I'm going to cover
the whole actual lid of my eye in this
primer because we're going to be using a
pigment for our glittery color the
glittery color we're going to be using
is called utopia I pack that right on
top of a flat shader brush from Sigma
and I'm going to be spreading it out now
as you can see I dampen the shade
that is going to make it show up more
and stick to our eyelid better creating
less fallout and notice if you go little
by little with this color and press it
into the eyelid you will have less fall
out because litter can be super messy
then I'm going in with my Sigma black
liner and this is an eat-in small
eyeliner brush which allowed me to get
really precise with the liner which you
can't see because I'm looking downward
and I'm sorry about that but I'm going
to flick it up and aquaria taste
fabulous now I'm going to add a few
coats of mascara to my lashes I will be
wearing falsies if you don't like Falls
Lee's do you boo and make this tutorial
your own and just pile on loads of
mascara or even a little bit of mascara
do whatever your lashes see fit I'm
going in with the iconic by house of
lashes I'm also gonna make a little
mustache out of them and I'm gonna pop
these on I've one these lashes probably
ten times so they're already shaped to
my eye so they went on pretty easy I'm
going to go in with this new concealer
from Make Up For Ever and clean up the
wing or that eyeshadows on the outside
of my wing and this is just a trick our
dual or you can use like a web makeup
wipe to do that this concealer has
quickly become one of my favorite ones
like I said this is the brand new silard
concealer from makeup forever and I'm
just in love with it as you can see look
how soft it blends out and it looks
flawless am i calling myself flawless no
but my concealers looking pretty good so
amazing this big fat kabuki brush to
blend it out and I really like this
kabuki brush to blend out my makeup
because it does it so quick and it makes
it seamless I love this brush now I'm
going to set everything with alarm RC a
translucent powder which I use in every
single tutorial since forever ago
I think it's Patrick Starr who got me
hooked on this stuff honestly like I
maybe it's Patrick Starr I can't
remember some other youtuber got me
hooked on it
YouTube's fault that I balled it and I
can't live without it now but it's a
great setting powder doesn't flash back
whenever you're taking pictures so I'm
just setting everywhere I place the
concealer not really baking I'm just
pressing
into the skin and that way we don't get
Creasy then I'm going in with this pure
contour stick and I have a full tutorial
using this but I really just like this
to contour my face with and this one is
in shade light so I just place it in the
usual areas that I contour my face and
then I'm going to blend this out with
the new contour brush from Sigma Beauty
I'll have all the brushes and products
use linked down below as usual I'm going
to take a little extra time and blend
all this out that way it looks nice and
soft this being a more dramatic look I
love the contour but honestly this
contour stick looks so natural you could
totally wear it out during daytime and
rock that cream contour now what I'm
doing here is I'm applying a thick coat
of the Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder to my jaw line and this is going
to clean up and sharpen up that contour
but you're going to want to leave it
setting here for just a little bit I'm
going to go in with the benefit rocket
or blush which is a beautiful knobby
shade which I think will look gorgeous
on any skin tone and pop that onto the
apples of the cheeks then I'll go in
with a fan brush from Sigma and the
Stowe Hollywood highlighted by Anasazi
beverly hills and pop that on the high
points of the cheek to give us a golden
glow and that way it matches our eyelids
then once that's that there for a while
I am going to blend off all of that
translucent powder and as you can see
which I've said as you can see like 20
times in this I'm sorry for being
redundant but it just says a beautiful
sharp line I stabbed my something I
again I don't know my Shias issue is but
it just makes the contour look nice and
clean now I'm going in with the very
first shade that we use creme brulee and
I'm blending it on the lower lash line
then I'm going to take a smidge of cocoa
bear and blend it right on top of creme
brulee to warm up the lower lash line
and lastly I'll take that dark brown
color americano and I'm going to take a
definer flat brush and I'm going to pop
it on right at the lower lashes and
we'll add a few coats of mascara to them
lower lashes and we're not done yet
we're going to
add some color into the waterline well
not really color well I guess black is a
color we're going to add Blacky to our
water line using this NARS eyeliner I've
really been loving this NARS eyeliner
now for my lips this is my favorite
go-to lip color at the moment this is
soar lip liner and then I've been adding
bear with me by dosa colors which is one
of their new liquid lipsticks these pair
together are just a phenomenal pair and
I've been wearing them non-stop so I
thought it would wear in the tutorial
and basically that's it the color looks
light but once it dries you'll see it's
a much of a darker pink there it is hope
