video is going to be this makeup to the
world that you see here it is a very
very blacked-out smokey eye with a pop
of gold glitter in the center hello
fabulous
that's a paired it with a nude lip
because most of the time whenever I have
super dramatic eyes I don't want to do
too much of a crazy lip because I find
that it clashes I feel like it should be
like one or the other I hope you're
excited to see this video like I don't
know what to do my hands they're always
like involved more than they should be
I've been really trying to a pond or
different looks to come up with you guys
I wanted to do a lots of color but I
know a lot of people don't wear like
bright green or blue eye shadow on a
daily basis so I don't know I want to
come up with looks that are more
wearable but involve a little more
pizzazz for you guys and this is one of
them I hope you liked the video if you
do let a girl know be sure to subscribe
for you leap or more fun videos this
hand is just going crazy okay we're
going to jump right in and get started
and you know that's what we're going to
do is to let them let's do that first
I'm going to go in with colace and start
blending it in with an e-40 brush from
sigma and this is just going to soften
up the eye primer that I have down and
make everything else easier to blend
this color is pretty transparent on my
eyes I'm going to be using for the zueva
cocoa blend palette I'm going to be
going in with substitute for love and
I'm just going to take this e 25 brush
from Sigma and this is a really nice
warm tone color and what I'm going to do
is pop it in the crease I'm going to go
all the way from inner to outer corner
and I will be using Lea's as my
transition shade so we're just going to
blend that back and forth I'm going to
try not to take it up too high because
I'm going to use so many dark colors in
this look I want to keep them all a bit
lower next I'm gonna take freshly toast
it was just a little bit more of a
warmer color because I want the base of
this color to blend out to like a warmth
so I'm going to take freshly toasted and
I'm just going to pop that right on top
of substitute for a love with the same
brush and I'm only adding a dash of this
color because we don't want to get cook
too crazy if I'm going to take my loyal
smoldering Lila
enter and just apply a touch of this to
the inner and outer corners of the eye
and then I'll blend it out and this just
helps us set up a dark base and for all
the colors that we're going to be using
in this video I'm going to keep this
Center clear though because I don't want
to get too crazy and that way we don't
darken up too much what we're going to
put a little bit glitter and take this
pencil brush right here is an e30 from
Sigma so a little bit of a mistake this
liner is kind of drying really quick on
my eye and it's hard to blend out so I'm
gonna have to like tug my eye to get to
dry out I made to get it to move so that
sucks but um maybe if you use like a gel
liner this might work out better
I'm gonna go in with a smidge of hot
chocolate from Anastasia Beverly Hills
which is a dark matte brown color now
we're just going to take this clean e39
and just like make sure that crease is
just very very smooth and Gloria ATL yes
honey yes blend away those lines and the
way all your troubles in life blend away
your money spending problems on makeup
then I'm going to take the dark shade
beans are white the name of that I
should have freaks me a little books I
don't even know like remotely what that
could possibly mean to dark dark brown
color borderline black and with this
little pencil brush I'm just gonna pack
it right on top of footage
I'm just gonna take a smidge of smaug
and just really lightly tap it on to the
lid right there no I was just thinking
it would suck really bad if I bugger in
my nose entire time I was filming this
because I have such a close up of my
nose like how bad would that be you
can't edit that out now for the fun I'm
going to be taking the heavy metal
glitter liner from Urban Decay in
Midnight Cowboy rides again the reason I
wanted to use his color so freakin bad
is because I went to three sephora's to
find it and I found it at Ulta what I'm
doing is obviously you see I'm just
laying the brush and just touching the
eyelid just to be honest nikkietutorials
is the one that is totally 120% got me
hooked on these freaking things she
slays everything she does and when I see
her using wind Oriels that's how I know
I want this mmm now I'm gonna take a
smidge of Midnight Cowboy which is the
actual I should have color not the
glitter and I'm just gonna pop that onto
my brow bone you know I'm just gonna add
a little bit of liner just to deepen up
right at the lash base we're using a
doughnut care by ballot boss lashes
these are faux mink lashes now we're
gonna work on the face I'm gonna be
taking this Estee Lauder app or
vanishing stick poor vanishing always
sounds good to me
oh is smooth this the first I've ever
used it very very very smooth I just
want to color all in my face with it
um and I'm gonna banish my pores within
shoes as my facial primer my god oh it's
so cool
okay okay I'm gonna be shaking up and
using my NARS luminous all-day
foundation the lesser amount that you
use the better it looks which is just I
don't know it's a weird concept but it
works well so I'm just gonna blend that
out with my Beauty Blender
pentagons my ex ex-wife anyone with my
next old reishi concealer and W I'm
going to go in my next altar HD
concealer in color see wo for base you
like at this stage of the game we all
kind of know where this product goes um
it goes under the eyes you know I'm just
gonna highlight my face and now I'm
going to blend it out my be blender but
first I'm going to give a few spritz of
mac fix+ spray and I'm going to add a
little bit of the larmor see a
translucent powder just to set that
concealer Sena concealer just makes it
last longer it also gives you a nice
crease --less flawless finish
I'd this one by Laura Mercier so much
because it does a great job in setting
it but also it doesn't do that flash
back on camera where you get that white
powdery look now I'm going to be using
this adorable sweetheart bronzer it's
called sweet tea literally it was made
for me
hello I'm from Alabama sweet a fan frame
I'm not really gonna contour today I
just pretty much use that side comes out
March 17th I don't know when this video
will be posted so it might already be
out we don't know
grab a little bit of dainty within more
feet 58 kept tab I tap things because I
feel like I pick up too much product
it's a great way of getting it off or
you could just like sling it really hard
without just pressing all that park up
on your face for my highlight I'm going
to be going in with hot sand by NARS
this is what I think the shades now I'm
like pretty sure it's new front to
finish smoking out the eyes I'm going to
take substitute for love which is that
warm brown color and just dust it from
the inner to the outer corner with the
e25 one of them I'm going to take a
smidge of freshly toasted and just dust
it below as well and I'm gonna take a
little bit of hot chocolate as well you
know we're really really really really
gonna smoke out this lower lashline
because like he's gonna make the look so
I'm filling I went back in with that
liner I'm just gonna do the waterline
and I grab just a smidge of ol slick
making sure to use a really flat definer
brush so that the color doesn't make me
like a raccoon and drag it right along
the lower lash line and of course coach
all the lashes with whatever mascara you
know that you're feeling that day Wow I
dropped the brush now there's can't here
all over it
I'm going to go in with creme brulee and
apply this to my lips and that's it for
this tutorial thank you guys so much for

see you all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
