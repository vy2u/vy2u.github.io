glam makeup look I will be creating lots

to go to Disneyland like that's how
excited I feel right now I hope you guys
enjoyed the tutorial this is my go-to
blam look I am told you guys like one
snapchat I was like I have this look
that I kind of go to if I have events
and stuff because this is a trusted look
and I know that it looks good and I
don't try anything funky or new when I'm
traveling because I don't want it to end
up wonky or weird if I'm not at home you
know what I'm saying and you guys were
like okay girl
but um where's your tutorial it's like
okay so here I am filming it yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial also be
sure to subscribe to my channel before
you leave so you don't miss out on my
other videos da all right let's jump
right in first I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of the hangover RX primer I
like to do this because I have dry skin
and this really just gives my skin
nourishing and it hydrates my skin and
if you if your skin is more Olli prone I
would suggest skipping this step but
your skin's dry it can really affect the
way your foundation lays on it
not moisturize so I just like to do this
around the areas that don't get too
greasy like my temples and you know I
know I'm being a little high-maintenance
using two primers but I'm going to use
the photo finish foundation primer by
Smashbox like cheese this one to cover
any areas where pores seem to be an
issue and it may look a little funny
right now I can have my brows filled in
but once we have everything on it will
all come together so what I like to do
with this one is kind of like tap it
into my skin I feel like it gets gives
the best effect that way because this
one is not for hydrating the skin is for
you know smoothing out the skin or any
texture in the skin next up I'm going to
go in with a Born This Way Foundation
from Too Faced this one is in shade
sand sand is too dark for my face
however it does match my neck and I wear
a lot of sunscreen on my face my face is
lacking Lane I use a darker foundation
to kind of compensate but you don't want
to do too much of a dark foundation to
do that then you should be looking crack
right in the bad way I'm going in with
the e30 one this is the brand new elite
brush from morphe I don't even know if
these have launched yet but I'll link it
below I'm going to buff in this
foundation I like to go and like
circular motions and just move it around
my face and make sure I'm dragging it
down the neck and around the ear area
because it is a darker shade than my
natural skin and so you definitely don't
be able to tell your foundation stars
and where it stops now I'm going to go
ahead and do the eyes I'm going to be
using my very own pallet with velop boss
um hi hello I love her oh my child okay
I'm gonna grab some Priss pot with this
e22 blending brush from morphe and I'm
gonna blend this kinda all over cuz I do
you have my Mac Paint Pot primer down
and
I want it to soften up the primer this
does also give you a warm base to start
with I'm going to swipe it around the
circular motion and just kind of buff it
all over the lid this softens up our
primer it makes everything so much more
easy to blend out the next shade I'm
going to go in with the same brush is
Britches which is like the best
transition shade you can use this shade
every single day to do any look is
literally the perfect turn just
transition shade and I think this shade
is great for all skin tones and I'm just
going to work that right into the crease
I'm not really going to put it on the
lid at all actually and I'm doing the
same thing just like circular motions
and just blend it until it's very soft
and there is absolutely no harsh edges
you want everything to look nice and saw
next I'm going to take fried which is
one of my favorite colors in the palette
and since I got to create this palette I
this was like an absolute must-have
color for me but I never see an eye
shadow palettes and I'm like where's my
mustard yellow at or if my brown mustard
yellow now that I have it I'm going to
blend that into the crease with a e25
brush from Sigma and I get it on one
side of the brush then I flip the brush
upward and then I just set it down like
right there and then we start working
the color back and forth blending it in
I have very little color on this brush
and then I'll go in with more because
just remember you can't take away color
but you can always add more so you want
to start with this little color as
possible especially whenever you get
into the shades that become a little bit
deeper with that same brush I'm going to
take Alabama which is a nice warm brown
tone color I'm going to pop it right on
top of fried I'm just blending really
softly like I have the lightest hand you
don't see me push in and work in the
color in you see me really softly softly
moving a color around because whenever
this shade is getting darker you don't
want to blow it out all over your lid
and a way to not do that is to use a
nice light hand when
thing and I'm just lightly moving the
color barely any color my brush mind you
these colors are crazy pigmented and if
you have a heavy hand with makeup we're
all a little different just try to
lighten your hand my sister has the
heaviest hand in makeup
she digs in her makeup and we argue
about it all the time I'm like stop
taking in your makeup so now we have
some built-up warm colors in our crease
and I'm going to deepen it up going in
with whiskers which is a nice expresso
brown color this one has a little bit of
warmth within the brown and I take even
less color on the exact same 825 brush
this is one of my favorite brushes in
the world for the eyes and I'm gonna
blend this right on top of Alabama just
building up multiple colors giving it
that nice soft gradient fill I'm gonna
do it the exact same way but I'm gonna
take it as you can see I'm taking this
one and just moving it a little bit
towards the lower lash line like so I
personally like to add just a little bit
more of my Paint Pot by Mac this one
since off oh Clark
it cleans up with some of the crease
shades have taken over the lid just a
little bit now my favorite part I'm
going to take particular patch was the
first color I picked for this palette
and I'm going to pack it onto my lid
this is an e fifty eight brush from
Sigma is perfect for adding color to the
lid this color is so incredibly
pigmented it's almost like a foiled
eyeshadow it literally is life you could
wear this color every single day and if
you notice I'm just doing light swiping
motions across the lid rather than blend
and oh pretty
next up going back in with my tried and
true my 820 Bible and the brush I
mumbling out the crease make sure it's
really soft and there's no weirdness
going on by awareness I mean harsh lines
next just for a little bit of fun uh -
hey bubs which is a really deep color on
this pencil brush this is a e30 I'm
going to see right there in that crease
and a really important step to me just
to tie the whole look together I take
sugar this is a tiny little East sixteen
brush I'm gonna apply it to the brow
bone and this can even lift your brow
bone and make you look almost like an ax
I'll if you may not even want that
though trying out this new liner pen
from la girl this is line art matte
eyeliner see what happens
now I'm gonna go in with this mascara
from Lancome look how weird how weird
the wand is and I'm going to apply some
mascara to my lashes and then I'm gonna
pop on some falsies from flutter lashes
but guys if you don't want to do falsies
absolutely don't just build up your
natural lashes with your favorite
mascara and your look will be just as
beautiful I'm just addicted to false
lashes and super glam makeup so you can
always just make it your own now I'm
going to do my concealer and finish my
under why I mean my under why when I'm
and was a Born This Way concealer this
one's really nice this one is in shade
light um I really like this concealer
just so you know I'm going to take the
artist brush the our teeth brush oval
six and blend this out these little
artis people who sell mad at me fuss a
artists I feel like I'm just gonna call
artist this little artist brush are some
of my favorite products in this make
industry they make life so easy this
concealer is so good just like the Born
This Way Foundation I love it so much
my take this e 53 brush and then this
banana shade from the honest Asha
Beverly Hills palette and set everywhere
I applied the concealer this just helps
it last longer also helps it not to
crease next I'm going in with the
beautiful pur cosmetics jumbo bronzer
this one is called glow together it is
half shimmery half matte and what I like
to do is mix it all together I'm going
to be taking this efore brush from
morphe I'm like makeup and I just kind
of like rub it all together so we need a
little bit of structure to the face so I
like to typically start at the top of
the ear and bring it on down add a
little bit of a contour then I'll bring
it all around the temples where the
sunlight naturally hits your face and
then I will just drag it all the way
around
I never neglect my jawline like I always
sweep it right around the jawline area
I'm going to take this blush from Revlon
this one is in Class C coral and I'm
gonna take a busy 53-foot like powder in
my nose and eyes hit this 83 brush from
morphe and I'm just going to dab a
little bit on the brush and pop it on to
the apples of the cheeks this just gives
me a little bit of a flash a little bit
of color to my face and I just blend it
on back like that you apples and then
one back
I'm gonna take my artist tour highlight
and Illuminati and then blend it on to
the high points of the cheeks and the
nose so
Creedy I'll do a little bit down my nose
by a little bit I mean a lot if someone
tells you you're wearing too much
highlight their line yeah what I like to
do now with the highlight is to set it
and let it melt into my skin and I do
that with my mac fix+ spray this is a
brand new one gotta get her going mm-hmm
I love the way mac fix+ smells it's just
like everything to me so now literally
it's the one city where too much
highlight I'm going to take breeches and
blend it all the way from inner to outer
corner with this 825 brush and just
smoke out the lower lash line now this e
15 this is a definer brush I'm going to
take bubs and whiskers just mix it
together the two dark brown colors I'm
going to push your really close to the
lower lash line now I'm going to take
just a little bit of Alabama and just
like buff out the lower edge of those
darker colors just so they look a little
bit softer more gradient I'm going to
add some of my Marc Jacobs liners to the
waterline as I mentioned before this is
one of my Holy Grail eyeliners and of
course pop on some mascara to those
lower lashes just wiggling it being sure
not to touch my skin for my lips I'm
going to go in with you ways at noisette
I do have a discount code for 15% off of
her liquid lipsticks and this is just a
nice brown color I'm going to apply it
all over my lips you can leave your lips
like this but I like a little bit of
dimension so I'm going to go in with I'm
nude by Jeffrey star this is another
liquid lipstick and apply it to the
center and then just like to Pat it out
my finger
love me afterlife</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
