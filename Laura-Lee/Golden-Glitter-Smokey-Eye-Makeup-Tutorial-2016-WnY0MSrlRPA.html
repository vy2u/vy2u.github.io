somebody to unlock my love
what can I never put my keys no looky
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be this very requested
look from Instagram this is the look
there were on New Year's Eve and I
posted look obviously I posted on
Instagram I couldn't let it go to waste
and a lot of you guys really recreate it
and I was like oh my god I kind of don't
want to because New Year's Eve is over
but you guys are still at Laura don't
hold out on us so you know what here
right now hope you guys like the look it
is very glamorous very glittery I would
wear it every day like this is a good
everyday makeup look in my book it's
great for any type of birthday party any
type of like going out you're gonna be
doing if you're going to like a big
fancy event you're going to a wedding I
mean you never know what comes up you
may need this look Barracuda fish or may
get started don't forget to follow me on
my social media it's right there be sure
to hit follow that way we can stay
connected and best friends forever go
glam a fire so have a sneeze now get
started I'm going to go in with my Mac
strobe cream this is just a moisturizer
and the reason I'm putting this on first
is because I just washed my face before
you start it and my skin so dry right
now next I'm gonna go in with this
primer that's pretty much been my
favorite lately this is the Lancome
Lancome visionary 1-minute blur primer
I'm going to take a smidge of it and I'm
just going to put it right here where
I'm having a little bit of pore issues
and I just want it to look very smooth
next I'm going to go in with this new
this is an actual skin tent not a
foundation by NARS but it has such great
coverage I've been using it as my
foundation and I am in shade medium one
they have a lot of different shades to
choose from
it's a mattifying skin tint I don't know
to me it's just kind like a foundation
I've been in love with it so that's what
we're gonna use today
got a really nice coverage definitely a
flat matte finish
I'm going to take the foundation end of
my luck see 180 brush from JT weighty
180 off Instagram
I really got this skin tint all up in my
earrings so it's no longer a rhinestone
all I got in both you that's kind of
gross next we're gonna start with the
eyes I pretty much use all making peak
eyeshadows for as far as the Browns and
the maroon ease and then I use a glitter
for the lid obviously so we're going to
start off in my favorite makeup geek and
actually some of these are honest Tashia
too but this is one of my favorite
palettes that I created first day i'ma
do is go in with an e Footy brush by
Sigma and I'm going to grab a little bit
of this color which I've never used
before that was sarcasm it's actually
called I think it's peach smoothie and I
just like to blend this all over because
I have my Mac Paint Pot down in soft
ochre and it becomes a bit tacky and the
other colors won't blend as well if I
don't do this so it just softens it up
now I'm going to be using my e25 which
is my all-time favorite eyeshadow brush
and then I'm gonna what I'm gonna go in
with a bit Keener see that I'll go in
with a little bit of creme brulee which
is just a pretty much in neutral shade
and I'm going to put on one end of the
brush and then I'll flip it upward and
I'm going to start blending that in the
upper crease this is a very subtle
transition say shade so my first shade
that I use actually is in a transition
shade it was just to soften up the
primer and now I'm transitioning to
another color next shade it minute grab
is fawn by anastasiya and I'm going to
put that pretty much right on top of our
transition shade if you notice I'm not
really focusing on the lid much I'm just
really focusing mostly in the crease
to get that really soft gradient look
I'll normally tap off the excess I
shadow that way I'm not going in with
like a brush with a load of eyeshadow
and then I'll use a soft hand taking a
lot of time just softly blending back
and forth back and forth kind of like
that small circular motions and I'll
just keep pushing the shadow around
until they're like it's very gradient
there's not going to be any harsh line
so you definitely want to just make sure
you're taking your time if you're having
a hard time getting out that really like
smooth look you see on Instagram but
some of that stuff is filtered okay now
a stable color that should be and
absolutely
everybody's eyeshadow collection is this
one right there that's Coco bear and
we're going to get a little bit of that
kind of on the tip of the brush tap off
the excess and pop it right into the
crease this is a deeper reddish-brown
color that warms up every single look
you
now we're just going to grab a small
smidge of americano because this color
is so dark you really want to take this
light and we are just going to blend it
right in that crease and I'm getting out
on the tip of the brush so that way I
can just blend it and focus it right
into the crease and not bring it up too
high cuz we don't want to be looking
crazy however I will tell you you see
how this eye shadow we've blown out on
the sides we're going to clean that up
have faith in me
okay we're gonna get it together it's
going to look good now I'm going to grab
a bit of corrupt which is just a matte
dark brown or not dark brown matte black
color and again just getting it like
boop-boop-boop on the tip of the brush
and blending a smidge of it in that
outer corner and then we'll just drag
whatever is left and work
now I'll take that e-40 brush which is
just a nice blender and we'll make sure
everything is soft and gritty now I'm
going to take a bit of this violet boss
this is glitter glue it's my favorite I
love this stuff um so what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to push it onto the
lid just all the way from the lower lash
line up into that crease both eyes as
far as the glitter I did use the matte
glitter and gold if you don't have this
from their Holiday Collection
violet Voss has a gold glitter very
similar to this on their site and I will
list it down below so don't panic but
I'm taking it 58 this is a flat shader
brush ideal for creams glitters and
packing on eyeshadow that's what we
gonna do and look at that glitter baby
your eyeball should start resembling a
golden disco ball at this point as well
as your face because the fallout is real
case you're wondering I hate the fallout
from the glitter so I actually what I do
is I take instead of a brush I like take
a cloth and I'll dab it away safer liner
we're gonna be going in with a morphe
black gel liner and I always use my 810
liner brush just because it's so little
it's so precise I love it
now that we have our wings on and we are
ready to fly away we're gonna take a
little wet wipe and I'm gonna I mean oh
I messed up my way now I'm going to go
in with my NARS creamy radiant
constituted and I am going to apply it
to the places that I always apply it in
every tutorial I'm going to do the under
eye area
by the way this is shade custard I'll do
down the nose the forehead
I'll be taking this what even is this
this is an f-86 kabuki and I'm just
going to like push it into the skin now
I'll take a little bit of my Laura
Mercier translucent powder on the end of
my 181 luck see beauty brush rut and
most are pushing this in to set that
concealer
I'm going to be using my mirror on
contour palette this is probably one of
the best pro pallets out there for
contour kits the shades are mostly cool
tone so they're amazing and I'm actually
going to be taking the opposite into
this Lexie beauty brush and then I'm
going to use it to kind of not to kind
of but I'm going to be using it to apply
the contour just to get it right in the
perfect areas like right under the jaw
bone I'm going to take one my favorite
bronzers of all times this is Tahiti by
NARS this is my favorite brush ever this
is the 180 the fan brush side so I just
go like shoop shoop shoop tap tap and
then I just swipe a little bit of it on
now I'm going to take the 182 brush and
it has like this sleek angled in and I'm
just going to contour the nose the great
thing about this brush is you use the
opposite in to blend it out before I
finish the eyes yes I'm going to add
false lashes and all that don't you
worry
you already knew I was I'm going to be
taking a little bit of Mac peach s just
going to put this color right here blend
it back right here right on the apples
of the cheeks but really I like to blend
it kind of on back to not just like the
front of the face because I don't want
to look too light huh now I'm going to
take what's up by benefit this is a
cream highlight and just apply it to the
top of the cheekbones and of course down
the nose I'm gonna go in with my e35 and
I'm just gonna blend that out
you can leave it there or to enhance the
glow I'm going to be going in with the
glow kit called that glow and I'll just
mix in bubbly and a little bit of
Dripping Gold I don't know I just like
both of these colors they're kind of
similar and I'm just going to pack that
on top
this is the Marc Jacobs of Marc Jacobs
velvet noir mascara and I'll just add a
few coats these upper lashes I am going
to be on adding false lashes because you
know you know you girl
I'm going to take a bit of fun and I'm
just going to blend it from the inner to
the outer corner which was I think like
the third brown color we use go in with
a touch of cocoa bear and just blend
that right underneath as well and last
I'm going to go in with a e65 on an
angled brush and take her up which was
some matte black color and just blend it
as close as to the lashline as I can lay
out a little bit more at that mascara
from Marc Jacobs I'm going to pop it
onto the lower lashes you get to make a
very ugly face to make this successful
I'll take a little bit of stripped down
by Mac this is a lip liner obviously and
it has a really sharp point on it which
is scaring me a little bit I went over
Zilla sharping it my lens has a cat hair
I'll grab a little bit of myth by Mac
this is a lipstick
I don't know I'm telling you that like
you're likely get it it's a lipstick by
the way this is my go-to lip color that
are probably where 5 out of 7 days of
the week
oh no where my keys are I think I need
some needle one I love what can I never
put my keys no Lukey you can
nobody's I don't know how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
