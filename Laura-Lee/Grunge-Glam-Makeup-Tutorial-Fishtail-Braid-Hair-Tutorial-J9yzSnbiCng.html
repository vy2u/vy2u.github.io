video is going to be this grunge glam
makeup tutorial this is something
completely different than I've ever
really done before because I either
either do super girly glam or just
neutral and I feel like this is a great
in-between tutorial too great for you
guys I did use the emerengcy palette and
I know it is discontinued but you can
buy every color that's in that palette
single or there's other Dukes out there
I mean I use pretty neutral II kind of
color but dark colors at the same time
and if you stick around to the end of
this tutorial I'll show you guys how I
do this big messy a volume S fishtail
braid and I don't do it the regular way
where you just pull one piece of hair
over and the other I have a super cool
trick to help you create this braid and
it's really really really easy to create
anybody can create this spray stick
around at the end of the video or you
can skip to that part of the video if
you just want to see the hair tutorial I
cannot wait for you guys to see this
look I really hope you like it I love
the look all of my lips are like grey so
cool but anyways I love you guys stick
around and we will get started to start
this tutorial i have already primed my
skin you see the primer water from
smashbox was surprisingly turn out to be
really cool and i did like it and then i
did go in with my NARS weightless
luminous foundation and stromboli and I
did blend this out all over my face and
my brows are clearly done I'm gonna go
ahead and pry my lips with my lips I'm
gonna go ahead and prime eyelids with
Mac's Paint Pot in soft ochre this is my
favorite primer however it is really
sticky so I am gonna go in with this
e-40 blending brush from Sigma and I'm
gonna blend makeup geeks Peach Smoothie
all over the lid basically well really
in the crease and a little bit on the
lid this is gonna help us blend
everything out and make everything soft
and really warm if you don't how about
Warren shade like this don't worry just
use any cream color you have that won't
really show up that well because
basically this just lays a base down
over our primer I'm gonna go in with
caramel first and I'm just gonna dip it
on one side of my brush and I love this
brush by the way this one is by morphe
this is the in 412 brush and
just have that dome tapered shape at the
end which helps blend the crease so
easily so I'm going to take that color
and blend it in the upper crease area
I'll hide a little bit of Morocco which
is a red warm color if you don't have
this color makeup there's Omega bear
makeup these cocoa bear is a good deed
for this and I'm going to pop that right
in the crease if you get some on your
lid that's okay we'll fix it later but
try to aim for the crease I'm not going
back and forth swiping motions and I'm
also gonna go in circular motions to
help blend all of this color out so I'm
gonna take a little bit of the color and
work it in the outer V area by just
pushing it just in that outer corner of
the eye and I am using the same dome
shape brush from morphe kind of
obsessing over this brush so if you do
an order from morphe definitely just
throw this brush into your bucket
I just recently discovered that I had it
so I did go way out on the corner of my
eyes and I do go back in and clean it up
later with concealer if you are a
regular viewer you already know the
business but if you're new to my channel
I'm probably scaring you away with this
madness I'm going to take this shader
brush from Sigma this isn't a 54 and
when you take the color vanilla and I'm
just gonna pop it on to the lid you
don't have to add much of this color
because it's basically gonna be covered
up anyways but I just wanted to lighten
the lid a little bit now I'll just take
the tip of my brush here and I'll dip it
down into a deep plum Mac has deep
damson which is an OCO that's just like
this one if you do want to order on
associa and I'm going to pop that into
the outer V area right here and work it
into that outer crease and then start
pushing it in the outer V just like I
did the red color
now I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
that vanilla color which is just a low
white mad at color you can use whatever
color you want to use I'm just gonna
pump this onto the brow bone as our brow
highlight this is just gonna help pull
everything together as well as give us
that bright lifted eyebrow bone eyebrow
bone that bright lifted Brooke I can't
talk okay now I'm gonna wing it out with
this little ao6 brush from Sigma this
brush is so perfect to do gel winged
liner with and I'm using a lot number 77
Blanc gel liner unforgiving the liner
I've ever used wherever you put it like
it stays there and it's even hard to get
off with makeup remover so you can't
mess up and I'm really good at messing
up with this stuff but sometimes I just
like to test myself and see my best face
I swear the first I'm just gonna cover
the lid with a crooked line but that's
okay we'll fix that in a second and then
I'll take the pointy ankle side and then
I'll just draw a line like that and now
I'm going to connect the line right here
and I'm just gonna start sliding it back
like that and start filling it in
now I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
my NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
color custard and I'm just gonna
brighten up the under-eye area
I'm just gonna blend this out with that
flat top kabuki tooth now I'm going to
go in with a little bit of this becca
cosmetics eye corrector and brightener
and i like to put this on top of the
concealer i find that it's really pretty
that's really pretty on top of the
concealer and it does work to really
brighten the under eyes me I don't know
if you can tell the difference that I
feel like I can't but it may be all in
my head I'll take a little bit of just
translucent powder I'm an f-35 brush
from Sigma and I'm just gonna set
everything that way does it crease where
it doesn't run
nothing gets crazy everything stays in
place I'm finally breaking down and
using my sweetheart bronzer this is the
Ross and Rachel from Too Faced and I'm
just going in with a huge fluffy powder
brush I'm having a hard time talking and
I'm just gonna blend this all over the
cheese I am NOT a contouring I'm just
warming up my face here
and this brother has just a little bit
of shimmer in it which is actually the
eautiful go in with between the sheets
which is a blush from colour-pop
cosmetics this one our new blushes they
just came out with and I'm gonna apply
that to the apples of my cheeks and
brush it backwards it's a really creamy
blush but it actually works well with
the blush and brush rather than your
fingers but I'm am sure you can use your
fingers to sounds go in and highlight my
cheekbones if you don't like to hunt
your cheekbones totally skip this step
but I'm gonna be using the jersey mirror
and illuminizer argan Luminizer I'll
just pop this onto the high points of my
cheekbones and blend it out with my
fingers
such a pretty eyelid because I have a
crazy high layer John can't we go in
with a little bit of back with cosmetics
opal and just apply that to the
cheekbones right on top of that argument
I started going with this mid sweeper
brush I'm gonna go in with caramel and
I'm gonna blend this from inner to outer
corner on the lower lash line this is
gonna warm up our lower lash line make
it look really soft I'll go in with just
a little bit of Morocco and bring it up
closer to the lash line and start
blending that out and lastly I'll go in
with deep plum and just a little bit on
the tip of my brush and just blend that
out towards the lash the lashes the lash
now I'll go back in with a little bit
that gel liner in this same brush I used
before and just fill in my waterline
I'm going to add just a little bit of
benefits roller lash and this is just
gonna cut the lashes because we're gonna
add false lashes if you don't want to
add your phone slashes do not fret just
simply load up on your favorite and
scare us by the way I do love this
roller lash by benefiting you're
probably wondering why the tube looks
like this and that's because support
sent me like this mystery sample of it
they came out saying oh the mystery
sample you've been using is benefits
roller lash I'm gonna be adding icon it
by House of lashes these are my favorite
lashes and lush history of all eyelashes
stars lips I'm gonna be adding Sebastian
write obsessive cosmetics lip liner
then maybe adding naked biker lactic
and now we're gonna go work on dish hair
gustaf this look our hair I'm going to
be using this root ant spray and my hair
is a little bit damp at the roots and at
the bottom of my hair but basically I
just spread this all through my hair and
then I blend it in with my fingers and
next I'm going to use a round brush and
my fingers to blow-dry all this out so
it's not hard and this just gives my
hair tons of volume I hate when I braid
my hair and it's stuck to the top of my
head and looks super flat so this is
gonna prevent that so here I am just
blow-drying my roots and blow-drying the
rest of my hair that was a little bit
damp at the end next I'm going to bobby
pin this back crown part of my hair up
we're gonna remove the bobby pins later
so it doesn't have to be perfect this is
just gonna help keep this part up as we
are braiding that way it's got flats
we're ahead then I'm going to take two
separate pieces of hair from each side
in my head I'm just gonna simply tie a
little elastic rubber band around them
then the trick to get this fishtail
braid is I'm going to create a Topsy
tail I don't know if you guys remember
these from the 90s but my mom did this
to my hair like every day so I just
looped the ponytail right through and
then I tighten it a little and
straighten it out because each one is a
little bit different doing the exact
same thing again from each side of my
head grabbing two separate pretty big
pieces of hair and then I'm going to tie
in a little elastic around it and
continue to Topsy tail each piece of
hair I call it Topsy tail and a lot of
people call it upside down ponytail and
different stuff like that but then I
just tighten it and straighten it and I
continue to do oh and I add this texture
tease to my hair because my hair is kind
of sleek and it will slide right out of
these elastics and it won't hold so this
texture taste berry helps it have a lot
of obviously texture and it helps it to
stay and it also helps the volume of the
braid to stick out bigger and that's
what I like I like a big fat fishtail
braid so doing the same process over and
over again and as I go I do spray the
texture tease spray down in my hair and
yeah it's really simple to do
I hope you guys like this tutorial is
just a quick trick way to do a fishtail
braid because I can't do it the other
way like I said my hair is too sleek and
it just slides right out of the braid
and it's really messy so this will
definitely stay in tact all day
lastly I just obviously pulled the
braided pieces just to get it to look a
little bit fatter and I did just tie the
end off and taking a rat tail comb to
poof up the edge and I did pop out those
bobby pins but you can leave them in if
you want to overall I'm obsessed with
this look and it's just a super cute
classy messy fishtail braid thank you
