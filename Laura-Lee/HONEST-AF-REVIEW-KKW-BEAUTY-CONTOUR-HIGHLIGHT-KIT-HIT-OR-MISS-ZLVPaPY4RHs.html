what's up part of people today's video
is going to be pretty exciting because I
am trying out the new and famous k'kaw
beauty contour sticks which are kind of
obviously already floating around
YouTube I'm going to say it just in case
tell me what I'll do don't know kim
kardashian I had an event and she
invited a lot of creators which I
thought was oh we have to meet can't
wait to take pictures she was so
freaking cool and we also um cover it up
so hello I'm going to review for you
guys it is such an in-demand product for
review and so you know I'm going to give
it to you this spot my neck is so much
more prominent and red today because I
got it lasered so it's going to be gone
soon but now it's all red puffy because
I literally got it lasered a couple
hours ago so girl she is she is having a
moment and I think besides a little
nugget right here this is all the
announces that I have and the only other
one else that I have is well go ahead
and you're ready to get started okay
let's jump right in I swatch these at
the party I only swatch the medium one
but mine personally scrub my armpits are
sweatin and I'm just in this t-shirt
today I am NOT like going all out it
comes in this bag which I saw a little
people being a little scuff that it came
in the bags they wanted like a box the
first thing I did when I saw the bag I
said oh it's a cool way of you know
switching it up from the Unipart in' and
then you get a second bag that comes in
where it's like sealed whatever mommy is
like medical moment like you pull out
you know this you get your medical tools
out that has been sanitized I don't know
maybe that's just my derm like speaking
but let's go ahead and open it up just
going to use my last dessert organics
cut it I am do you have the brush that
is sealed in its own container it's so
cute as I go it's like a tiny little
brush and it has a sponge on the end
like I said this one isn't medium so
first we'll open it and so here's the
product rolled all the
out realtalk that's not a lot of product
your pro makeup artists and wanting to
use something like this on your clients
it's not going to take you a long way
for personal use it's probably still one
last you that long but personal use will
probably last you longer than like a pro
makeup artist who wants to use this on
client I wouldn't really recommend it
for that just because that's going to be
pricey you know just keep having to buy
these and then you get the highlight
sticks so one side is shimmer and the
other side is the cream highlight which
we'll be trying out on our face you get
the exact same amount of product
watching them right now they are
extremely oh no lateral damage for the
review so far this watching really
creamy I mean they swatch really creamy
at the event okay with the medium I
didn't realize one side is a little
darker than the other I'm learning as I
go
and there you have the swatches the
product more warmer caramel a little bit
of a deeper medium highlight and then an
actual light coverage highlight a little
bit more coverage in this more of a
bling bling moment so brush feels like a
soft very soft kabuki my first
impressions of it it did not look soft
at all but feeling it is soft the sponge
I can go ahead and tell you I'm not here
for just because it's not sanitary and I
hate personally I hate sponges on
brushes like on a stick I just think
it's too weird thank you and you know it
definitely moves the product um it's not
as soft as a Beauty Blender and mousse
the product but I find that it drinks a
lot of your product and there are uses
to blend out of contour now it's just I
think this punchy go I think they should
have put a I mean listen to me I'm less
professional I just think that they
should put a secondary brush on it they
should have put a type of brush to blend
out the highlight and a brush to blend
out the contour here we have the dark
highlight in this is the shimmer and
then this is like the conceal highlight
moment and then here we have the dark
contour and almost this and down here
the contour would only work for me it's
not too deep here our swatches see
that's the color that would almost work
for me
it's a little bit warmer and then this
is a highlight shade which you could
even use is a pretty cream eyeshadow the
conceal highlight moment and then here
is the deepest end of the stick on the
dark one here is the deep dark shade
this is the deeper end and then this in
down here is the one that's a wee bit
lighter and then this is the
highlighting stick for deep dark you
have a nice peachy highlight end and
then the shimmery highlight is a
beautiful golden bronze there are some
swatches of the deep dark they blend out
so easy as you can see there just a few
swatches and blend out easy and again
because I have this on hand i've
swatched it I could use this as a pretty
eyes shadow moment here we have light
this is the deeper end of light here are
the swatches of O and shown to you
before I show you the hell I don't know
why I did that
but here are the swatches now this
highlights a girl that's super light so
I don't know how that's going to pan out
obviously it would work out for me but
the highlight on it off the shimmer
highlight is beautiful and let me go
ahead and show you the actual stick and
of course each packet came with a brush
just dealing with the packaging it
rattles a little bit on the within there
rattling I love the coloring of the
packaging I love the convenience of the
packaging it's not luxurious packaging
I'll just put it that way so like light
weight and they feel a little bit a
little bit cheap for the price okay so
now I'm going to wipe off my face makeup
I already have a little highlighting
contour on and I've got to reapply
foundation and then we're going to dive
into contouring our face with it I'm
sorry a side isn't on me hopefully not
though so I've already put on a little
bit of foundation and add just a little
bit of concealer because the highlight
sticks are not to conceal darkness
they're to simply highlight your face
because we're highlighting and
contouring not concealing and covering
concealer I would prefer to go ahead and
put it on and put the highlight on top
of it a little bit versus putting the
highlight on first and then the
concealer because I want to go ahead and
cover the darkness and then add the
extra highlight in areas
a little bit more brightness because
we're highlighting highlighting my face
adding the brightness and then going in
and cover the darkness I just really
don't want to mix in my concealer with
all the highlights so we have one to use
the highlighter on top of the little bit
of concealer that I have on these appear
to be going on really pretty smooth and
matte for whatever reason I feel like
that medium shade is a little bit deep
for me yeah so we're actually going to
use light on my skin today to highlight
because I just the medium shade is
almost the exact same color as my skin
tone so what I'm going to do is go ahead
and highlight under the eyes you're
going to highlight and triangular motion
because the light shines down on you and
naturally snatches the light light and a
triangle in motion so just a little bit
more of a natural fill you can get a
little bit more of a prominent round
chin a bigger upper lip a straight nose
and a beautiful highlighted forehead
these are just breaking off left and
right because I feel like whenever
they're not rolled off all the way it's
like a little nugget that I'm like
digging into my skin so that's a little
awkward for me right now actually going
to go ahead and use the medium contour
stick on my skin so the lighter edge is
for just a nice contour and if you want
to really get in there get a deeper
contour or more bronzed out look to your
skin way more color you would go in for
the constable number two the deeper edge
and experience first impressions using
these on hand I think the packaging is
really cool sleek and beautiful but it
is so hard to read the name every time
I'm like what because the name of them
is so incredibly similar to the color of
the packaging I get it is a cool trendy
and fun but I'm like struggling a little
bit over here however if you have one of
these sticks at home or one of the kids
at home you don't have to read the label
every single day so it may not be that
big of a deal
I feel like this shade is a little bit
the lighter shades a little bit too
close to my skin tone so I'm going to
contour with the deeper I don't like to
take my contour down too far because I
find as you blend it out I'm left with
like this weird darkness in the
area where it should be bright so just
try not to take that contour down too
far and you can really just like fill
out I'm doing it so I'll be right there
but you can fill out your cheekbone and
make sure you're not dragging it down
too far either and these are the areas
that I would come for I'm going to take
my kkw brush and go ahead and start
smoothing out the highlight which is
actually has a little bit of coverage to
it I mean it's pretty thick like it goes
on honey this is not a joke
I'm actually surprised in how much
actual coverage goes into this highlight
and it looks like a little bit of
product goes a long way so maybe the
little bit of product that you get in
the stick for 48 bucks it actually you
know will last you a little bit longer
than I thought that I would they blend
out pretty easy I mean I literally just
took me probably two to three minutes to
blend out all my highlight and the brush
is really soft I don't mind the brush I
was switched over to brush in because
this plunge is something I'm not really
wanting to use because I just don't use
stuff like this because it's too
gimmicky for me no I love the word
gimmicky you know I'm going to use it on
this tie my face for the sake of the
video so if you're interested in using
the brush at home or you won't forget
that you'll be able to try it out I
think it just is like literally eating
the product off of my face too
I don't know I feel like it just
literally sucks the product off my face
so the sponge maybe that can be revised
in the future I don't know I'm actually
going to take a clean brush not
everybody will have two brushes I
understand that but if you wanted to use
like a beauty blender for your highlight
and then use a brush for your contour me
show you now how you can use a brush for
your contour because I mean the brush
obviously is not just like sweeping this
off my face is more so trying to move
the product around and blend it out on
my face I find that this product is
blending out really easily which tells
me that this is a nice product for
beginners you're not going to be
fighting the product to get it blended
out or if you're not really into cream
contouring I think this could
potentially be a cool product for you to
like test it outing give it a go
sucks that they sold out cause it
doesn't suffer kilm which
congratulations to Kim for them selling
out bad they'll be back in stock for
sure so I'll typically go ahead and
blend up my contour my nose and no my
finger I'll gently tap out my highlights
I don't want to move the highlight too
much you know when I get a funky nose up
on them like this my pinky animal and
just like you just do to do and really
try to keep most of highlight their
overall performance I think it looks
beautiful I'm going to add a little bit
more of the number two contour from the
medium stick I'm doing my cheekbones
could use a little bit more drama even
if this brush heads those like
double-end it with the same brush on
each side I don't think that that would
be bad now I'm going to take the medium
shimmer highlight side so this is going
to be number two side and highlight the
cheeky bone area I'll put one little
dash here run it up the nose right on
top of that keep it slow and now I'm
just going to tell you all my stuff is
broken because I keep rolling it up too
far because I cannot draw with the stick
not out that much such a bad habit for
me I don't know why I have to ruin
everything now I'm just going to dab
this side out with my finger the
highlight is so incredibly not
where the natural highlights so it
definitely wouldn't be like her to come
out with something with blinding I think
my skin has a soft natural contour I
think it has a soft natural highlight
and I think my highlighter is so natural
and beautiful but natural I could have
taken it more by going in with the deep
contour stick and really contouring and
the lightest is the light with a
highlight stick and really highlighting
I could have taken it there but I don't
think these are meant to do that with I
think these are meant for this everyday
beautiful soft look I don't always wear
soft everyday makeup I like the full
beat I like that the contour highlight
look I think that if you're going to
produce something that represents you
and what you wear which Kim now wear
such natural makeup that this is the
product that she would come out with and
it makes sense I think it's a beautiful
product but I'm just gonna be honest if
you are a like oh I like it cut
cheekbones
I like the brightest under eye is the
most blinding highlight you might not
like these if you are trying to get into
cream contouring and highlighting and
you know you're kind of weird with it or
a little confused with it I think these
are a great beginners product don't roll
the product up that much you don't get a
ton of product so if you're using it for
just you that might be okay but if
you're getting into artistry these
probably are the best thing because
you're just going to run through them so
quickly they blend out easy but you
might want to get a second brush because
this brush is probably going to only be
good for one of the two blending because
you'll have dark or light on it and you
don't want to mix it I like the product
I think it's a great product for
everyday use and I will probably use it
again honestly this was just so easy and
quick to use I just try to put out the
socks and then let you guys decide what
you think be sure and leave the poll in
the comment section what do you think is
it worth $48 you are buying the Kim
Kardashian name by the way I'm just
gonna throw out there you're paying for
her name and I like him and I've never
heard anything bad about her when I met
her she was just is nice
as a human being as just normal and nice
as she could possibly be and I
appreciate that for her status in the
world that she was that kind and just
nice it was is really refreshing to meet
like that I'm still going to keep it on
until it sticks and tell you the pros
and cons which I think that that is once
you gave them to us to do that with and
this is our first product and as a brand
you grow as more products come out and
you perspect them as you go and I'm sure
she'll be perfecting I mean look at
Kylie's first lip glosses the brushes
were all wonky and then you fix it she
isn't human and you have to respect
things as you goes I'm sure she'll be
perfecting more makeup that comes out
for her which I'm excited about
there are pros and cons with these and I
think I listed them in the video I'll
probably be using them again I had a fun
time using them it's a soft makeup look
it's not harsh but it's pretty so I laid
it out there on the table there are hits
and misses about this product honestly
if I was a was an influencer and didn't
get these into me I would buy them but
that is just my thoughts on it I hope
you guys enjoyed the video and I hope it
answer some questions for you guys and I
hope it really gave you like the inside
scoop on the k'kaw beauty I love you
guys so much thank you for being here
watching oh and by the way I was in and
go on top of this makeup instead it was
a little bit of powder and add a little
bit of power plants or any time to put
on a cream grow up put a powder on top
of it armpits are hot don't forget to
