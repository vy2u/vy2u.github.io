channel so today's video is going to be
helping you guys out with foundation and
how to make it not look cakey but yet
still being able to use all well
majority of the products that you like
to use it on your face and still get
that good coverage but yeah it look
really smooth and flawless on your
foundation and that's my goal with
today's video and you guys know I do so
many reviews and fun stuff like that on
my channel but today I love like TG
makeup and teaching tips and tricks and
I kind of feel like that's kind of how
started my channel with like tutorials
and my Hox videos and like all my do's
and don'ts and tips and tricks like if
you look back like that's what I did
like all 2016 and 15 I feel like kind of
those years were the years I spend doing
that and then I shifted a little bit
more into reviews I've so much fun doing
reviews and you guys really enjoyed
those but I love kicking it back
sometimes and doing the little cheetah
cheetah chat teaching videos and just
talking makeup with you guys and how to
perfect it and get it to looking a
specific way so today we're gonna be
talking about how to get the makeup it
looks super super super smooth on your
skin this Friday I will be announcing
when cats pajamas is coming back in
stock so if you're not following the
larlie los angeles Instagram page we
should follow it if you want updates on
my brand new stuff coming out and when
things will be back in stock also I've
had a couple people buy the palette off
eBay and received a fake palette I can
only assure you that you will get an
authentic couch with you if you buy off
morphe brushes Beauty Bay or larlie Los
Angeles calm that's the or the morphe
store those are the only places that
dupatta is being sold anywhere else
there's so many fake versions of my
palette already made I was like Daniel
don't waste no time but that it's just
fact and I'm had people email me saying
is this a real palette and it's
absolutely not a real palette it's just
a waste of money so be sure that you
aren't buying it off the Amazon eBay
because I can't guarantee that those are
gonna be real cat's pajamas palettes as
you guys know the world of fake makeup
it's getting really really big so beware
I don't know I don't know what they do
when to make that makeup
anyways I just want to say that for the
safety of all of us okay so without
further ado I have to each my ear and
without further ado do we're gonna sing
a little
subscribe to a channel
did it
subscribe to my channel before you gone
subscribe now let's go ahead and jump
right into the video
okay jumping right into this video let's
talk about skin I think just getting
like that flawless oh oh so smooth and
silky it finished I've no makeup on my
face my basis and my eyes are done and
if you have a lot of rough texture
exfoliating helps somewhat so I put a
good exfoliator right here that I enjoy
using one is from your ad it's just
super super good and our recent just
well the Kate Somerville one it's really
good superfine green exfoliator however
I don't recommend over exfoliating
because then you will all of a sudden
and start getting a rough skin if you're
overdoing it because your skin on your
face is still very sensitive it can't
take that hard abrasive scrub every
single day your skin will start to build
up a tolerance it's trying to protect
itself from the scrub so I like to
exfoliate once maybe twice a week and
leave it at that and we my skin feeling
gentle I feel like it really helps buff
away the dry dead skin and then I'm sure
to moisturize over moisturizing I put a
good moisturizer right here a gel one
cuz you guys know the tea I'm Jill
moisturizers on my channel if you don't
like water-based moisturizers which are
gel versus the cream based moisturizers
which a lot of time cream ones are old
based so they're a little bit heavier if
you have mature skin you might like the
green ones better than the gel but the
gentleman are very very very hydrating
especially the Garnier moisture balm or
the Aqua balm which is a little more
pricey gosh there's so many the origins
ginseng moisturizer there so this is so
many gel moisturizers that are great
they hydrate your skin leaving it really
plush and get rid of dry spots without
overdoing it because if you overdo it
you can get little whiteheads or milia
on your face which again is texture and
it's not gonna look so smooth here we
moisturize but you might just be
overdoing it and clogging pores which we
don't want so now that we've touched on
skin I will recommend to priming
products so priming the skin hey you're
gonna have to find the prime of this
right for you because the farmers right
for me might not be right for you
and vice versa if you were dealing with
big pores and you need to smooth that
area out I recommend getting a pore
filling primer the professional is a
great one from benefit if your skin is
dry and you're not so much worried about
pores you can use something like this
for Sally one I think it's
super-super skin and retching it's super
moisturizing and also the also the one
from smashbox the prime Iser it has
hyaluronic acid which retains moisture
into the skin super super super great
for moisturizing so here is some tea on
primers and not getting your makeup to
look cakey with them if you're using a
hydrating one I'm gonna show you both
just for the sakes of the video but I
will take something like this guy and
I'll kind of rub it all over because my
skin is dry it all over moisturize a
thin layer all over my face but let's
say I didn't just apply this to my face
normally I would leave it at this I
really like this cuz if you can see it
gets a little bit tacky and I love I
feel like it adheres the foundation on
really well anyways so if your skin does
not you want the pore feeling moment I
recommend not applying pore filling
products all of your whole entire face
it's too much makeup and it can make
your foundation not look as smooth and
make it look a little bit cakey or
trying to avoid cakey makeup here in
this video so I recommend taking
something like this and taking maybe
half a pea-sized amount like seriously
the smallest dab I warm it up which
makes it apply a little bit better in
between my fingers and then see here's
my poor area right here so I'm just
gonna mush it in and I feel like it
fills those pores kind of press it so
good and I'll leave it at that maybe a
little on the chin pore filling primers
or something that kind of sets on top of
the skin and I do feel like they do
somewhat separate your foundation from
your skin and in some cases it's okay
because it's filling the pores but I
don't like it all over my skin I think
it makes the makeup look cakey so if
you're gonna moisturizing one I would
put it all over my face using a pork
filling one put it on those specific
areas that you need it and that is gonna
help to cut down on the cakey cake
alright next up is foundation actually
applying the foundation and it's so so
very important that you find a
foundation that is not too cakey lately
they've come out with so many good ones
if you want a full coverage that's
affordable the Milani one the
three-in-one Milani one
it's amazing if you want to every day
one the Maybelline fit me it's great
Madame poreless I'm gonna be using the
hood of beauty 1 today I think it's
great I think it's super moisturizing
and not cakey whatsoever also the new
Laura Mercier wants another full
coverage one that is great but not cakey
and very long-lasting I've so many
foundation videos that break down
foundations for you you can type in
foundations like on the search of my
videos that you'll find so many
breakdowns of what a good foundation if
you already found a good one for you
let's talk about the application now you
guys have already seen me apply a
foundation a bazillion times and I like
to use the Wyatt 6 from morphe you can
either apply your foundation dabbed on
to your skin like this or you can put it
on the brush and stipple it I really
don't think it makes a difference that
is your preference it's not gonna make a
break in the makeup so today I'm gonna
be applying it I already have it on the
brush I assumed you guys in a little bit
and if you notice I always do this in
stipple foundation on so there's a
couple reasons I do this one is because
it really helps cut down on the brush
like strokes in your foundation don't
know if you can see the strokes
stippling helps cut down on though
whenever a makeup has a scent to it
which this does it's not that I don't
like the simple whenever it gets really
close to my nose and I try to talk to
you guys and breathe it the same time so
much is happening I'm always like my
issue is I'm just applying it and not
talking to you guys it's not an issue
anyways I do CIPO because it helps cut
down on the brush strokes it's really
really really good to give you that
flawless airbrush finish it also pushes
the makeup into the skin and I believe
pushing it and stippling it with a brush
or Beauty Blender this is my favorite
brush to y6 it helps them make it to
last longer also I feel like if you just
put a primer such as the professional
one like I just did all over my face I
feel like if you're pulling and pulling
and pulling you're literally just moving
that primer around whenever you are
stippling I feel like you are pushing
your foundation right on top of the
primer without moving the primer around
so these are really great tips to get
that flawless flawless foundation let's
talk about concealers so with concealers
it all truly depends on the concealer
that you're using one of my favorites is
the NARS creamy radiant concealer I
really like the new
when wild one if you want an affordable
option the photo ready photo finish or
put it ready it's a newer one from one
wall it's really nice it has a weird
scent to it but it is a nice concealer I
just tried a wipe away a freckle that
I've had my whole life I need to get it
together
anyways today I'm gonna be using the
NARS one I know this heart-shaped one is
a tarp shaped Cape one is really popular
so what I like to do is just pump into
the thing once like one little and then
apply it if you are using something like
Tarte shaped tape I can never apply this
much of it because I will be blending it
down to my freaking elbows I'll just put
a little bit on my forehead whatever's
left
I feel like adding too much concealer is
such a culprit for getting cakey makeup
and people wondering why crease and why
it doesn't last that long and I feel
like concealer just adding too much of
it is a lot of the reason of that tarp
shaped a the thicker the concealer let
me just put this way the thicker the
concealer with a more high coverage the
less you want to apply to your skin
blend that out and if you feel that
later you know what it's just not enough
consider girl I'm gonna need more you
can then go back in and add a little bit
more but you don't want to start out
applying an assload of concealer to your
face it's just too much it is going to
leave you Creasy and so I'm gonna take
the same brush and I like to stipple
back and forth so I used to not do this
but I recently like this year I have
been doing this I go oh did she mess up
her winged liner a little bit that's
okay I like to go back and forth because
if you notice if you swipe one way
there's like creases in the eye the
product cannot get into so if I go back
and forth it really works the product
into all the creases and it leaves you
looking less Creasy and what bam baby so
don't lay it with a lot of makeup
artists will tell you to do whenever
they do your concealer and I don't want
to crease look like keep looking up and
then they'll go ahead and apply the
powder back and forth back and forth
back and forth to make sure the powder
gets in all the creases so TTT on this
it just depends on the person you are
really and the makeup look you're going
for but I prefer you using a translucent
powder if you don't want cake a lot of
cake so this Laura Mercier powder is a
foundation powder it isn't meant to be
worn kind of like a foundation it's
meant to be worn like a foundation or
lightly over a foundation or
a really lightweight foundation it's not
meant to technically but you want you
can do whatever the hell you want being
honest like what are the rules but if
you wear it on top of full coverage
foundation after eight hours you might
be looking a little bit cakey so I
prefer to use something like the
ethereal power about powder by Born This
Way by Too Faced it's a really good
translucent powder it's much more
lightweight it's really I know you guys
have seen this 110 times on YouTube but
it's really good for baking so again
with baking in and out in and out in and
out in and out and I like to use a butyl
beauty blender to do this because I find
that the product sticks to the Beauty
Blender and it won't explode all over
your face and this is also gonna lock
the makeup in place it'll make it last
way longer and it will help you avoid
that creasing honey and my smell lines
are pretty gnarly most the time so if
you bake your smell lines a little bit
it helps them not to crease so badly it
just depends on the person and we don't
all have these small lines that are just
like attacking us every day like me I
apply a little bit of powder in the
smile line area down the nose and right
there in that t-zone the t-zone it's
gonna help it not look greasy and cakey
and I really like to just beat it in
there just beat it baby normally after I
let this set for however long doing it
so you can let it set for one minute you
let it sit for five minutes whatever you
want to do I'll take a fluffy brush this
is a G at thirty at five and I'll buff
away the majority of it that way it's
not too cakey the software to the brush
the better for the under eye area
because that under-eye skin is so
delicate and you don't want to pull on
it I'm still glad when I ready my line
I'm like wah-wah you're gonna have the
wrinkles mama so I wiped away all the
powder with this brush and using the
translucent powder instead of the
foundation powder it's just gonna be way
more lightweight and if you can see my
skin looks velvety super velvety I can't
help I have natural like this is the
shape of my skin I I don't have filler
in my under eyes I've considered it but
um I'm too big of a push to do it so I
won't do it but this is just my natural
creasing that's such bear like if I
don't have those creases there would be
no crease
at all because my skin but I feel like
it looks super smooth on the other eye
we have good coverage so if I was going
to do a cream contour I would have done
that before I applied the transcend
powder that way the cream product goes
on top of a cream now on top of a powder
which is a big no-no I just wanna
mention that um you know you put a
powder on your face and then you add a
cream on top of it that you can run
yourself into a cakey mess because the
creams not gonna blend out as well
having a powder on top of it I'm going
to take an r14 brush this brush is
perfect medium sized a contour brush I'm
gonna go ahead and contour my skin today
I'll be using it the hoola bronzer and
I'm just gonna go ahead and contour and
I know again like I said I look super
powdery don't worry about that I'm gonna
show you how I get rid of like this
super powdery look subs gonna buff this
into the hairline and again everything
that I mention in this video I'll link
in the description box down below as I
do 90% of the time sometimes your girl
Laura gets really crazy and busy she
only has time to list the products and
not link them but I would try to get
them all linked before this video goes
live to help you guys figure out where
you can find the product or just look at
the prices of the product or you know
check them out so I've been using this
blush non-stop I don't think it really
matters like what blush you use as far
as cakey makeup I like to personally
apply my blush a little bit like on back
like I'll hit the apples but then I
really like to work it on back you guys
know I'm not like a blush fanatic or
anything I really do like this peach
blush from dose of colors the actual
name of it is amazement okay next up for
highlight i'm gonna be using glow glow
glow goals from Oprah and
nikkietutorials so I'm just gonna get
some of this this is a our 14 our 36
what does she talk about she she is the
our 14 hour 36 brush and I really like
to kind of keep this product a little
bit more on the cheeky area right up
here and not so much up here because if
you apply a highlighter more so in the
pore area baby girl is going to pick up
every pore in your being
and magnify at times ten oh she's
blowing okay so the trick I look like
super powdery right now and that's no
lie and I hate it and I used to not do
this and I would be like use the powdery
girl but what I like to do is I like to
really not you to set my makeup but
really to cut down on the powdery look
I'll take a Mac fix plus or whatever
sang spray you got on deck and I'll hit
the whole face with it so let me hold
this her back okay now what I like to do
because you can see this setting spray
sitting right on top of my skin I have
to take a sponge do you see that same
spray sitting on top of the baby hairs
and I like to melt it into my skin I
feel like it makes this makeup look I
mean obviously it's gonna look up makeup
on but it makes it look a little bit
more skin like and not so cakey and I'm
not rubbing I'm padding so it doesn't
move the makeup around it's just
pressing it into the skin and a pop on a
lippy you guys can't know about yeah I
think this is like the best color ever
that is it for this video guys I hope it
was helpful and I hope it broke down
do's and don'ts and how to avoid that
cakey makeup and less is more and apply
right where you need it I feel like my
smile lines are not cakey it filled my
under eye I mean I just have the creases
that I'm just God bless me with but as
far as like under here it's not cakey
it's super smooth it's like everything
looks velvety I actually do have a good
bit of makeup on it's just applied in
the right way so again I hope this video
was helpful I hope you guys subscribe
before you leave be sure and give this
video a thumbs up if it was helpful
and I will catch you in my next video
