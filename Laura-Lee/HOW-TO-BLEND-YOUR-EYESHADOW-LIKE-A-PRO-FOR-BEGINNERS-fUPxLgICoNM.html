makeup has nothing to do with this video
basically I filmed the video and I
forgot to film an intro and the way that
that happened was because I normally do
my intro starting out the video but I
decided hey I'll wait till my makeups
complete since we're teaching makeup and
show them the final look but because I
did that I forgot to film the intro and
we can't have a video without an intro
hello sometimes I'm just so easy in my
mind so crazy I'm a human being I mess
up so I'm making the intro right now for
this video and yeah that's what it's
gonna be so today I'm gonna teach you
guys how to blend your eyeshadow like a
pro this is a very in-depth video I'm a
little bit more serious in this video or
more calm I should say my version of
calm but I really wanted to focus in so
many people asked me so many questions
about eyeshadow and blending it and how
to apply it and get it that soft smooth
gradient look so I thought I would take
the time in this video to really go in
depth and teach you guys this is a very
very in-depth video so why it's kind of
long and that's what we're gonna do
today but without further ado let's go
ahead and sing a little song be sure
yeah that was probably really loud cuz I
grabbed my Mac but let's go ahead and
jump right into the video
good by the way I paused about halfway
through this video and how to go to the
store and I've been gone for like three
hours and my makeup still looks good
so this makeup last telling you guys
you're gonna learn some tricks today
hope you ready hope you're ready okay so
jumping right in my gray hair has come
to haunt as all you know always comes
back and it brings all of its friends
first I like to start off with my eye
makeup doing my eyebrows if you like to
do this last there's no wrong in that I
just personally like to do my eyebrows
first so I'm gonna be using the precise
leave of my brow pencil and shade number
four I've been using this for a long
time I like to start to do is actually
start the eyebrows at the bottom will
have a nose itch I'm not picking my nose
like that and I always this pencils very
pigmented as you can see I barely
touched my eye so you want to use a
light hand and you also want to do baby
hair like strokes that's the point in
the pencil having it small tip like that
Shazam so I like carve out the bottom of
the brow first I'm awesome missing a gap
of hair right there on both sides so I
like to draw a straight line and not
follow that gap that way we're filling
in the missing hair gap and then I'll go
ahead and line out the top I won't start
right here I kind of start
midway through and then start slowly
combing it through little hair like
strokes this is gonna make it look a lot
more natural so right about diagonal I
go ahead and start my little Archie
right there I'm also missing a lot of
hair it just will not grow back from all
that waxing I did back in high school if
you didn't know me important influencers
partnered up with benefit and we are on
the packaging of some benefit products
and my product is that precisely my brow
pencil so if you go in Sephora and
you're able to pick it up you'll have a
little piece of white Latino glam on the
packaging thank you so much benefit for
working with me on this product and this
is my tried-and-true favorite brow
product go in with a little bit more of
a heavier hand and then this area what I
like to do is draw like one two three
four five hair strokes upward where is
very sparse I don't want it to be too
block
and the key is combing through in the
front of the grouse so it's not they're
a square and then I always use my finger
and just swipe up and that is my eyebrow
and as you can see it's honestly a huge
difference I'm gonna go ahead and fill
in this brow and then we'll be right
back cool we now have both eyebrows
drawn in and now a really good trick
we're gonna get into eye shadow and this
part has to do with eye shadow and I
highly recommend this trick is to take a
concealer for me I like to use the Mac
Paint Pot in soft ochre I've probably
been using this for 6 or 7 years on my
eyebrows to card them out and this is
just the best I should a primer to me
you're not into a concealer eye shadow
primer I know Smashbox makes the great
one so I like to use this product with a
flat synthetic brush something that
looks like this
this is m41 and this one is genius for
carving out the brows because it's not
too long and it's very flat so you can
get precise so I like to brush it on
there and get it on both sides of it
coating both sides of the brush and then
I will go underneath the brows now
sometimes if I'm feeling more natural I
won't carve out this eyebrow I'll leave
it as it is because it looks pretty good
carving out the brows also allows for
like covering these hairs that need to
be plucked
I'm gonna do that I like to go right
underneath small strokes it's one big
stroke and then whenever I like run thin
on product I'll just flip the brush over
that's why I get the product on both
sides of my brush a little trick right
there
we'll just carve it on out like that and
I'm gonna get a little bit more my brush
and just paint it all over my eyelid and
this is the great part that we're gonna
use because guess what guys we just
applied our eye shadow primer I'm gonna
tap it out make sure your products also
on there really smooth guys if you feel
chunky this that might mean your Paint
Pots dried out you know it's time for a
new one my normally dry out before I can
use the whole thing but I pretty much
use the whole thing and will do the
exact same thing on the other eye but
this just looks a little bit more clean
these hairs probably need to be plucked
but I don't think they ruin the look I'm
saying
now we're jumping into a shadow I highly
recommend you find yourself some good
I shadow that's just a great tip and I
know it sounds stupid but using crappy
eyeshadow it may not be you having the
problem and maybe the product that
you're using and good eyeshadow doesn't
always have to be expensive today I'm
gonna be using the 35 F palette from
morphe this is like a 22 dollar palette
and you get all these shades and also I
recently just did a drugstore dupes
eyeshadow palette so if you want to
click that video find something palettes
from the drugstore they work out great
you can do that you don't always have
spent a lot of money to get great eye
shows but just make sure you're getting
the right eye shadow because there are
drugstore or really affordable palettes
that are crap and not worth your money
and they may be forfeiting your eye look
for the price so just make sure it's
been your money saving your money the
right way on eyeshadows I think these
are great and the reason I'm going to be
using this palette today and picked it
specifically because of this row right
here I'm going to show you guys how to
use you know do a neutral great
eyeshadow look in this palette has those
and it's also I find that makeup brushes
helped too we're gonna go over makeup
brushes as I go and what makeup brushes
I love and why I'm using them this is an
m5 35 it is a fluffy brush and it's a
medium fluffy brush and because this is
so look at that how tacky that is you
don't want to go in with some eyeshadow
it's not gonna blend on that it's gonna
be way too tacky so you take a cream
bone shade or you can take a shade like
this guy right here which is very it's
like warm but it comes off very
translucent light I'm going to swirl it
on the top of my brush and then I'm just
gonna kind of go all over like all over
like back and forth one two three four
and what we're doing is we're softening
up the eyeshadow primer with this color
and that way whenever we go in with a
transition shade it won't just like
clunk and stick together and a pallet I
love when I see a pellet has like a
neutral matte shade in it I'm just like
yes please and thank you give me
something to soften up that eyeshadow
primer and this brush is so soft so it's
great for just fluffing around color
like that
the next brush I'm gonna use is an art
39 is tapered at the top and it is a
small i'm tresh oh you hello get excuse
me it's a smaller blending brush so it's
great for medium to small eyelids if you
have really big eyelids you can continue
on with the first brush we were using
but I like to downsize a little bit more
and this is just a tad bit more dense so
it's gonna pick up a little bit more
color so next what I like to do is bump
the color up one our actual primer is
soften but we don't want to just go in
and explode dark color all over our eye
so I'm now gonna go in with this shade
right here which is just a little bit
deeper you see we're moving on up in
life you can even use something cool
like this I'm gonna go with something
warm as a transition shade one thing I
like to do is get it on one side of my
brush not both sides and tap off the
excess and you literally see we lost
some color there and that's good because
we don't want that color to explode and
fall right and what I'm gonna do is flip
the brush upside down clean I'm shadow
plug it in your crease and then very as
you can see like my hand is so light I'm
gonna start at the outer corner and I'm
doing like the baby is possible like
motions to softly blend that out not
having a fully-loaded brush also helps
the process so I am just very softly and
so once I feel like the color is pretty
much all placed on the outer corner I
will take what's left of the color and
start to sweep it forward into the inner
crease because I don't want this much
pigment over here unless I'm doing like
a spotlight smokey eye where I got the
inner and outer corner looking deeper
but right now we're just doing like a
typical eyeshadow look so we'll do very
light pigment in the inner corner and
then darker pigment on the outer corner
so you can do a little back and forth
I prefer both motions it's like the
whole winch wipers when swiper win wiper
oh my lord I forgot how to use words
when she wiper motion and then I also
like to go with the small baby circles
those are two different ways of doing it
and then here I go it's okay if you get
it on your eyelid too
look at that I mean you can literally
even just with that learning how to do
that and getting a good medium sized
brush in that crease that could be your
eye shadow look I had the brush up where
I'm gonna flip it downward I'm gonna go
ahead and hit that outer corner look how
soft and small strokes I'm going be sure
to take your time to you
breathe in breathe out look at these
tiny strokes just oh I'm not going back
and forth huge I'm not blending it
hugely and I'm getting a really soft
look out of doing this go ahead and hit
it in the center and again whatever is
left on the brush we're gonna move on
right there right on in that inner
corner mm-hmm and if you notice I'm
getting a little bit wider and it's
because I barely have any product left
on my brush so I'm just moving that
outer edge of the shadow right there I'm
gonna do this eye and be back with a
darker color all right we are ready to
move from this shade I'm gonna skip this
really cool shade and keep moving on and
going with this guy right here it's a
little bit deeper and what I'm gonna do
is I'm literally just going to tap the
top of the brush the tip of the top of
the brush and then tap off the excess or
you can like flick it if you want to and
so now I have such a small amount of
color at the tip of this brush it's the
same brush that our 39 them using yes
our 39 and I'm going to focus it right
same spot but we're gonna keep it a
little bit lower girl a little bit more
I just tapped again into the color a
little bit lower also if you hold your
brush like a looser hand instead of
really tight you'll be able to flex the
brush around more so kind of like gently
hold the brush like really light
handedly like you could almost drop the
brush yeah you're gonna do those tiny
tiny circle motions muscles motions
right in that crease girl and now I'm
gonna take a little bit more I dipped
into the color again look how soft I'm
going back and forth back and forth
really close to the lower lash line
keeping it real low have such a small
amount of color I don't have to worry
about exploding everywhere
it's like a mukbang I feel like I'm
talking so soft but I'm really close to
my mic right now and I don't want to
blow you guys as eardrums because the
color is deeper if he knows we're kind
of focusing it mostly towards the outer
edge the deeper you go the lower I
typically keep the color you can also
take that in five three five and where
this edge I mean is that just honestly
fine but if you want to get real soft
since it is
got that soft shade that doesn't really
show up on it you can take it and just
go ahead and smooth that out give it a
little extra blend right on that edge
notice I'm not pushing it in the crease
I'm gonna go back in you gotta go back
and forth of that motion now I'm gonna
do my other eye we have ready to
transition down to a different color you
can use like a chocolatey Brown if you
want to or you can use a warm tone since
this palette has a nice warm tone right
here I can't help but to use it kind of
creepy with me like poking my head
around the palette but I'm gonna use the
same brush still r39 you don't have to
have 50,000 brushes this brush is really
just a gym but do your makeup I'm gonna
get it onto the exact same spot just
right there on the tip of the brush and
I'm going to tap off the excess and
we're gonna keep this color pretty low
because it is very warm and I'm gonna go
ahead and start putting it right on top
of the other colors you're wondering why
I use so many brown colors if you notice
is very gradient as the color goes up it
doesn't look like I just have one color
on my eye so I normally start from light
to dark and then I normally keep it the
darker I go the lower I stay kind of
moment there and it really helps the
eyeshadow look to look really beautiful
like he used 20 colors but really we
just usually only use four okay so
there's a lot of color but it just looks
so pretty whenever you take your time
and use like a few different Browns and
I'm kind of doing the same thing you
know focusing the bulk of it on the
outer corner the outer corner can take a
lot of shadow and then whenever my brush
is pretty much empty of shadow I'll go
ahead and swing it forward just really
lightly and I'm gonna go back with that
in five three five that fluffy brush and
do the same thing smooth out those edges
this palette has like quiet an
arrangement of soft shimmery shades I'm
actually gonna go in with this one
that's a little bit deeper do you have a
lighter skin tone these are really
beautiful but I'm gonna go in with this
way that's like a gold undertone would I
use that in four two one the one we
carved out our eyebrows with we have two
of these brushes as well cuz I love them
a lot for a lot of different uses and we
are going to Pat the color on once
and the brush like wait where's my color
oh yes this one Oh
swiping that color on one side so you
don't have to wait your eyeshadows I
actually love to I mean she's a little
bit setting spray he's watery he's your
favorite setting spray he use whatever
you want but you can see right there the
brush is wet
and I love wetting the shadows cuz
you're gonna see why you deal with so
much less fallout and they just become
sticky it's so much more pigmented these
shadows don't have to be wet a lot of
shadows don't have to be wet I just
prefer it and once you start doing it
it's kind of hard to go back so with the
shimmery shade if you notice I'm doing a
completely different technique and I'm
placing it in the opposite in I'm
placing it in the inner corner and I'm
pressing the shadow down this brush has
a rounded tip so it's really nice
because it snatches the crease perfectly
right in there because it does have a
square tip so you want to get a brush
with a rounded tip and then boom put it
right up to the crease right where your
crease starts if you have hooded eyes
you can cheat it and like take it up to
here make it look like your crease and
then whenever you're looking forward
your eye shadow see how you would be
hooded your eye shadow would be up here
and it makes you look a lot less footage
take your time pressing shadows I'm
going about half way on the eyelid where
this harsh line is we're gonna fix that
no worries I have a little bit of our
deepest brown color on a my r39 brush
and just smooth out this harsh edge I
mean I'm so lightly going to take the
tip of the brush and just pull that
shadow outward little baby strokes like
that and then you can also take your
shimmery brush go back and forth pull
the shadow as well for eyeliner I'm
going to take one of my favorite liners
on the market this is the NYC liquid
liner it's just honestly the best for
beginners it's such a good liner brush
too and this is so Ford we'll have to
get out Amazon now it's kind of hard to
find in the United States but I'm gonna
go ahead and
very thinly starting at the inner corner
so I'm just going it to take it all the
way across and then I'm just gonna go
whoop just the edge and get such a tiny
amount of product on this brush so time
and today I'm going it to wing it out so
I like to start in that corner of my eye
with a at flatten brush and then I'm
gonna I kind of two weeks they're gonna
see this okay cuz I'm just gonna bring
it on back small baby strokes
I'll flick her up to clean up that wing
and we got a little bit of work to do
right here I'm gonna pop on some Lily
lashes I will link them down below Leila
while the lash glue is drying hello I'm
gonna take this shade right here about
our third shade is I believe I'm gonna
take it in two tin brush it's still
fluffy but it's kind of a straight line
pretty flat at the top and dense so it's
great for the under eye area I'm gonna
get some on the tip of the brush and tap
the brush off and then I'm gonna blend
it on the lower lash line I don't like
to neglect the lower lash line I feel
like it looks pretty ball down there and
you can really complete look by just
smoking that out a little bit so I like
to strictly just kind of go back and
forth back and forth right underneath
the lashes but keeping it kind of tight
to the lashes and the darker the color I
like to keep it more towards the outer
corner versus like pushing a darker
color all the way across it comes off a
little bit heavy this color is pretty
little light not too too dark so I'm
gonna go ahead and pull it on the inner
corner next I'm gonna take the warm tone
color
with the exact same brush I'm gonna do
the same thing but I'm going to keep
this color a little bit tighter up and
I'm also not gonna take it all the way
to the inner corner I'm just gonna take
it about half way and like that you have
an easily done smoked out lower lash
line I'm gonna take Mac feline liner
this is just a black pencil liner and
I'm gonna do the waterline I'm only
gonna put this color in the waterline
I'm gonna make sure and not put it down
on the skin sometimes I accidentally do
and that's okay last I'm gonna take my
Marc Jacobs velvet new or mascara and
I'm gonna pop it on the lower lashes by
wiggling the wine back and forth back
and forth trying very hard not to but my
skin although sometimes I do that
anyways lastly if you want to the steps
optional you can take em two three six
and three to six
hello Dyslexic and you can take a light
shimmery shade I'll take this second
chain right here you can pop it on the
inner corner which is really gonna open
up that in our corner of the eye and
make your eyes look very awake and open
and you can also take the same brush and
just pop a little bit on the upper lash
line but not too much this can give you
a little lift and tight everything
together and lastly I like to take a
little bit of the NYC liquid liner and
just run it across the lash band to make
sure everything is matte and black this
is the final look guys I hope that it
was helpful for you guys I hope you
learned something to answer some of your
questions when it comes to applying
eyeshadow now you can apply eyeshadow
like a pro I'll have everything I use in
