video is going to be talking about Ali's
skin and how to I'm going to talk to you

perfect foundation and not having the
Olli mess I am a super greasy greaseball
during the summertime you know I get the
grief right here and mostly on my
forehead and it is a never-ending battle
but I have done specific things to help
control the ole now I am well aware that
I say the word all wrong instead of oil
I was raised in the south and girlís
always always is oh okay so you're just
some happy Bob has that in this video
because I'm trying to produc pot it also
may be talking about a lot of products
that are great for oily skin they will
all be in the description box down below
so check that out before you leave that
way can help you decide on what products
you should be using I will be talking
about drugstore and high-end products or
I'll have them listed down below anyways
but yeah this is I don't have any lip
product on I completely forgot to put
lip product on I don't use the final
look and actually like looking at myself
in the monitor right now it's very matte
and beautiful and we're going to get
there subscribe to my channel and don't
forget to turn a little notification
bill because that will let you know that
Lauren Lee is posted a video and then
you should be watching it alright we're
going to write Anna get started okay
yeah Oh Lord my nose is bleeding I
scratched myself okay guys this is my
skin you are looking at right here super
close-up this is my greaseball area and
occasionally right through here which i
think is like the typical was about
please stop bleeding with it a is a
pretty typical area to get Olli
throughout the day so I'm going to teach
you on my tips and tricks and we're
going to jump on and get started bar
stuff I'm going to recommend you guys
wash your face I know I may not feel
like anything's on your face in the
morning but there's lots of grease and
let there residue from sleeping for 8 6
5 hours how long you slept
go ahead wash it off and begin with a
clean start next step is moisturize and
you need a moisturizing a very specific
way do not use a cream moisturizer if
you have oily skin I'm telling you it is
full full ears packing oil on your
already Olli skin there are so many
great
yo moisturizers out there that a water
basin still obeys that will hydrate your
skin even more than a cream moisturizer
it just doesn't have oil in it there are
legit loads of gel moisturizers that are
amazing or free and will grease up your
face they will moisturize it they will
end any dry skin and dry patches on your
skin day I'm going to be using tar to
h2o drink of h2o it is such a great gel
moisturizer very lightweight just two
dots that's good enough and this just
creates like a flawless base on your
skin once that is done I like to let
that set in before I move on to the next
step just give it a minute 60 seconds
something like that and then we're going
to move on to priming the skin this is a
pretty important part
it creates a great barrier between your
face and makeup and if you use the right
primer it can help control the amount of
all you're producing one that I love is
the anti shine flawless base by Natasha
de Nona
this one's great for oily skin and
another one that's new that I'm loving
is the self adjusting complexion primer
shine control by Urban Decay today I am
going to go ahead and use the Urban
Decay one literally just going to do a
small pea-sized amount nothing cray-cray
and then I like to rub it in the fingers
and I only apply it to areas to get a
little breezy I literally don't take my
whole face in it it's not your
foundation it's just your face and you
know you don't want to use too much
product X we'll go ahead and move on to
foundations you really want to look and
make sure that your foundation is all
free you want to make sure it doesn't
have a lot of sunscreen in it although
that is great for protecting your skin
from the Sun some cream usually leads to
creasing this all over my face granite
if I know I'm going to be out in the Sun
all day I'll just go ahead and add some
screen and say you know it's going to be
a grieving day to protect my skin but if
we're going to be indoors all day honey
I skip it to dress some ones I don't
have on hand because I can't find them
because I am a cluttery mess is the pro
infallible Pro matte infallible by
L'Oreal and then the matte and poreless
by Maybelline and then to higher in ones
that I'm loving is the this is the
makeup for ever and then
Clinic beyond perfecting these are both
really great foundations today I'm going
to be using me make it forever stick
this is in 1 5 5 so I'm going to show
you a way of doing your makeup but not
using too much soot a little bit on the
chin a little here a little there and
then one stripe and then we're going to
work on blending dis out now be careful
your precious friend called the
Beautyblender because it retains water
obviously you wet them and you're
pressing water into your skin you're
adding more hydration you're adding more
water which could leave you a little bit
more greasy so I personally like to use
in our teeth brush this is a little palm
brush or just like a kabuki or something
like that to blend I'm gonna make it out
with today I'm just going to use the
palm brush and go ahead and blend it out
now if you notice I have not added
foundation around my under-eye I
couldn't think what that sculpt it's a
crazy also make sure you're washing your
brushes I'm in 2017 we all know to wash
our brushes and if you're not doing it
you can be putting bacteria on your face
an old grease old makeup just taking it
on every day in conclusion which could
leave you with more breakouts should be
a lawyer I could have taken the
foundation and added it right here and
under here but I'm going to go ahead and
put concealer there anyways and same
rule applies even sillier make sure it's
all free and not too taking cakey if
you're dealing with oily skin because
I'm going to add cover to that area
anyways I'm not going to double a home
makeup of negative put foundation and
concealer if you dry skin you might be
able to get away with this much easier
but if you have oily skin this is a good
way to skip out on the grease
not going to use as much product as I
normally would so I want to be a good
example for my friends with always skin
you see on Instagram and all your girls
that you love to watch do makeup
tutorials including myself I'm not
saying you love to watch me to makeup
tutorials I'm getting to a point I
myself we use a little bit of an oil to
blend out a cream contour and how I
really hope the products move easier if
you've always seen don't be doing there
girl don't do it and you might want to
stick with powder contour which is just
as beautiful as cream contour
so I'm just going to take this little
brush and just tap that out and I am
fitting some truth the next step I'm
really going to suggest you guys is
setting your foundation this is probably
one of the most crucial steps of the
yang concealer foundation if you put on
a cream be sure and set it I had a
history of not doing that myself and I
would add a little concealer to my
under-eye and literally because I didn't
set the concealer it would snatch little
pigments from my mascara and I want to
have black running down my face and it's
because there was no powder there to
stop the mascara grease from blending
into my concealer I was looking about
another mistake people can make with
setting their foundation and I would
you're thinking how can you make a
mistake once I add well if you set it
with a foundation powder your it will be
beautiful but you're in for a head of
your outcome you're going to be wearing
way more makeup it's doubling up on
foundation foundation powder and
foundation and you double the coverage
you double the makeup double over highly
recommend finding more of a translucent
type powder that's merely furrow control
and setting the make of a setting powder
nice foundation powder you can read on
things long lasting pressed powder okay
cool this one doesn't say it so it's
just making me look like an idiot it's a
setting powder though and then this one
is the perfect setting powder one of my
favorites from covered eye so I'm going
to go ahead and use my Rimmel one today
take my morphe 41 brush and really just
go ahead and girl we gonna lock it in if
you want to add a little extra setting
powder to the forehead or the areas you
specifically get extra Olli by all means
get on in there
so here is my foundation that I'm going
to go ahead and add a little bit of a
powder bronzer because like I said
before you want to use the power bronzer
or not like the cream contour if you're
really fighting the Oly battle also the
more shimmer and shine your products
have within them like the luminosity
primers the shimmery bronzers they're
really sparkly blushes they can really
enhance the only look if you already
have that natural glow coming from in
you might want to stick with a little
bit more of a matte product this makeups
also because you said it and you've used
all these parts so don't put this slide
off the face it's going to last longer
we're myolie girls out there I'm not
saying like don't wear highlight don't
wear anything shimmer I our face yes it
can enhance the Olie look but if you are
going to wear highlight let's make sure
we never are taking it down too far into
this vicinity because gross make sure
and really focus it right here and just
not really go you know
much further so the makeup still looks
beautiful you know it's not nearly as
much makeup as I was typically wear
because this is the wintertime is my ten
month I can get away with it in the
summertime girl it is not a game so last
but certainly not least is setting your
makeup with a setting spray I don't
always do this I'll use my Mac six plugs
which isn't necessarily for making the
makeup laughs and help with all control
or my touch of dewy skin miss same
difference it doesn't really help
without setting your makeup with an old
control setting spray there's a lot of
them out there in the market makes makes
a great one
Urban Decay has to just be slick it's an
old free what you want to make sure
you're setting spray is and that when
this foundation is really locked in
place and you don't have to worry about
it moving right guys this is the file
look I really love the way then make it
came out it's it's super matte but it
doesn't look to fakie really too cakey
either and I hope my tips and tricks
helps you guys out and I'll see you
while I'm a next video with the problem
but boom your lady go you better set
that face well alright manny has been
yanking women you cannot do it it makes
you more successful wearing and you're
