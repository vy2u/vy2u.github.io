of my videos would never throw one of
these angels the more I wave the more
cat hair goes in the air never a good
day to wear a black shirt when you have
cats hey guys welcome to my channel
thank you for being here today first and
outs are really quick I just want to say
my 500k giveaway going right now and it
ends - timber - the scent whoa it's
December the 10th and I'm just gonna
have that link down below if you want to
enter that giveaway also this video is
going to be me shooting with you this
load of stuff I have it right here I'm
gonna share with you all these super fun
holiday goodies I just so tight share
with you tomorrow is Cyber Monday and
that is just super exciting some help
with hoping to kind of guide you as to
what you might want to get as gifts or
for yourself because I know like every
year on Black Friday I would go shopping
and I'll just end up buying a bunch of
stuff for myself and it would just be
like Laura you didn't do good girl we're
also gonna do stop stop trouble talking
also gonna talk about some stocking
stuffer stuff that could have been a
tongue-tie and actually get that out
really well stocking stuffer stuff yeah
girl range up right in be sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
okay first what I want to do is I want
to start with like smaller idols that
would be good for stocking stuffers or
to give to your friends so you're not
trying to bomb like a hundred dollar
gift or something crazy like that just
something small we'll start with those
items and then we'll move on to the big
good stuff first thing I want to talk to
you guys about are these little
colour-pop mini set cute I can just cry
when everybody saw em I was like I love
miniature anything I'm just obsessed
with mini thing so whenever I saw these
so it's just like they're $20 apiece so
really good value dill if you need to
get someone a little gift and also the
pink one right here these are all new
shades I were gonna get any of this set
I would get the liquid lipstick and pink
this one is called kitty now the gold
one is also very gorgeous and neutral
but these are their shades they already
have out and this set is called foxy and
out here not like liquid lipstick gal or
your gift giving to someone who isn't a
liquid lipstick lover you can get
trippin which is actually just they're
the piece ago just the regular lippie
stix again filled with super neutral
colors I feel like you could wear any of
these colors at any point you're like
and how happy would you be if this
wasn't your stocking next on the agenda
these are kind of random but it's just
something that my sister and her
co-worker discovered so I kind of jumped
on the bandwagon with them these are
called essence essentials sugar scrubs
and we kind of went crazy and ordered a
bunch of them we found a coupon code off
the internet like I'll free told me not
and if I find that coupon code or if I
find out it's still good I will link it
down below but I just wanna let you guys
know that these are for the holidays the
price went down well on this side the
other day and I noticed I guess for the
holiday season that the price went down
so they're having specials long I'll be
sure we see my favorite these are salt
scrubs so I think these will be a cute
gift like if you got someone and tied
them together with a bow that would be
such a cute gift to give someone or you
could just pop them in someone stalking
individually super nice gift so this
one's called sugar mama this is actually
my all-time favorite one out of any of
them and then this is sweet Lemon Drop
for lemon lovers out there my mom will
love this one although that one
empty and we don't want to do another
order I'm gonna get her another one
sweet Island girls so this is another
one that smells like coconuts and then
Cherry Bomb this one reminds me slightly
of Japanese flower blossom from Bath and
Body Works but this one's actually a
salt scrub not a sugar scrub a little
bit so I think these are precious and I
hate the packaging on them though I
think the packaging is super just plain
I think that they need like a bow or
something tied around them from jouer
cosmetics I think that this would be a
super cute gift to give somebody this is
like the little cosmetics bag but inside
you get three of they're pretty shimmery
lip glosses so if you have a friend out
there that it's just not on the liquid
lipstick train ride they might like
something a little different I would get
them the lip glosses this cost 35 bucks
so I think this is a precious gift to
give a friend or a stocking stuffer and
oh I have a discount code with them now
so it's like 15% off so I'll put that
down below but eclipse ysidro and
stellar are the three colors that you
get and they're just really pretty
glossy lippies and then you'll get the
cosmetics bag as well next little gift
how freakin precious is this toothpaste
come out with this last year and I
wanted it so bad baby didn't get it this
year I got it it's such a cute bag it's
just covered and glitter and then it has
the Eiffel Tower a little on the
keychain little shim dig little paper
and then you get three of their
lipsticks so these are full-size lip
cream lipsticks this one is WAM taffy
and nude beach what you could do is buy
it keep the bag for yourself and then
like gifts these individually to friends
or pop these and stockings I don't know
or you could give like your best friend
the bag and a lipstick and thank you
brother to way and a set is 30 bucks
from Cielo cosmetics they have a little
mini liquid lipstick set which I think
issues precious love the arrangement of
colors and this because you really get
everything and these are pretty big
they're like half the size but still
that's a lot of liquid lipstick I'm
gonna be very honest with you I cannot
find these online so I'm one
this is an in-store only kind of deal
but I think that that I would just be
stoked if this was in my stocking as
well as giving this as individual gifts
to friends again like you could just
either give like a whole gift set to
your friend or honestly could tie a
little bow around each individual one
and give them to your co-workers or your
friends just anybody you know that you
need to give a gift for maybe like get
the whole set to a cousin you like a lot
and then like a cousin gets on your
nerves you can just give a homage to
stocking stuffer ideas is from first aid
beauty so this is 15 bucks this is her
hydrating vitamin spray and a lip
therapy I love the hydrating spritz
especially after I wash my face and your
face like all hot and flustered and
pissed off at you either just adds
vitamins and nutrients and it also
moisturizes your skin and then the lip
therapy awesome so this little set is
$15 and I think it would be so cute as a
gift to give or something stuffer and
then there's also the fab cleanse and
exfoliant so this one is ten bucks this
is a very affordable gift to give
somebody and I think anybody would love
this oh and it says bonus ten days ten
day facial radiance pads so it looks
like they added some little pads in here
too not for your panties for your face
all right we are officially done talking
about soccer news heifers we're going to
move on to like the big good juicy stuff
to ask for for Christmas or to give to
like the best person in the world or any
beauty lovers out there we're moving on
to that gel Soleil RCA starting first I
have to mention this little case by
two-phase it's not a little case at all
this one's sold at Sephora
now I'm not going to go in detail with
all their Baker's ins collections
because I did a big full blog post with
swatches and close-up in a million
picture so I'll link that blog post down
below but this one's at Sephora and it's
like a pop-up house and you get the eye
shadow insurance and the mascara and the
lippy and then you get like this really
big palette which comes with blushes and
bronzers and highlighters and eyeshadows
I think that the kit is quite lovely and
I used to every year ask or to face for
my Christmas present I have some in UT
this kit because I think it's just such
a good deal I wrote down all the prices
so I could tell you
the stuff I could find prices on this is
a $60 set which I think will be a great
Christmas gift because I'm going to show
you what's inside I really want to do a
tutorial with this get a big ginormous
mirror as well as four other gorgeous
blushes and then you get it how many
eyeshadows can't remember form one two
three four five so twenty eyeshadows and
a mini mascara which this is a good
mascara but there I shadow I just love
the color arrangements this in this set
I don't know if they're like super
shimmer but super matte and super
neutrals so it's kind of like right up
my alley and the blush colors are really
pretty as well so I just think like as a
big Christmas present won't in my
household this would be like a big
Christmas present that this would be
super awesome
I have some crazy big sell on their
website this one's $28 right now and
like everything is on sale on their
website so again it's like a mini
envelope what's not really mini cuz it's
still pretty big but it's smaller than
that oh why me this one you get twelve
eyes shadows in the mascara and a little
lippy which is a pretty peachy color now
I do like the colors in this one again I
do prefer I don't know that's a hard
call which one I prefer
I get like literally a hunka eye shadow
just fell don't hit me lastly is there
sitting my love gift set right so here
is the palette on the first one you get
a pink a super shimmery like cranberry
color a very pretty champagne color a
shimmery brown color and a nice matte
chocolate color and then this is the
blush bronzer and it looks like a
highlight so it's like all for your face
because it's like a kit to do all of
your makeup in like your eyeliner your
blush your bronzer your highlight your
eyeshadow and your um lippy so I don't
really like this set is that right here
is originally 50 but right now on their
site it's 34 which I hope these things
are still gonna be on so whenever I post
this video I'm gonna talk about the
bigger sets from colour-pop cosmetics I
just think these are such awesome
products and all their stuff is
manufactured right here in Los Angeles
that's are $30 apiece
and I think this would be also like a
nice gift to give your sibling or
something like that it's like a nice
medium gift so the first one is a liner
gift you get three of the gel liners as
well as three of the pencil liners
purple one is called vixen I'm not even
telling you the names of them and you
get these colour-pop lippie x' and you
get six of them lastly which is my
personal favorite one is the eye shadow
one this one is called blitz I love
their eye shadows I think they're
amazing they're five dollars each so the
set is thirty but it comes with a lot of
super sparkly eyeshadows for the
holidays add that pop of color to your
lid girl and you just work one of my
personal favorite things and I would
love love little of love to get this for
the holidays so this is soap and glories
bright and bubbly holiday gift set so it
comes in this super cute little box oh
it smells so good something that's elite
oh my god oh that right now is 18
dollars which is just crazy affordable
it comes with a loofah the bath gel the
body butter which is my favorite the
hand food as well as witnesses this is
the scrub but the scrubs my favorite
scrub is my favorite all this in this
cute container as well as a loofah how
freaking cute / $18 for $18 I love this
oh oh alright let's talk about tart a
little bit this is my favorite set from
them this holiday season I had a little
trouble last year with their eyeshadows
and their holiday set so I was like very
untrustworthy but they do have a new
really cute holidays that I'll share
with you in just a second but I want to
focus on this one because this is my
favorite holiday set from them first of
all this packaging it's just so it's so
2015-16 like this is this is what it is
like literally I don't know why I say
that but that's what I think of like
it's just so mmm this is the brush set
another thing I'm having a lot of
trouble finding online if you do find it
please let us know where you found it
online I think this might be one of
those in store only things this big
fluffy powder brush which is personally
my favorite one you get like this little
angled really nice soft brush you get a
stippling brush and then you get like a
powder brush I would just said with this
brush I would set my under eye and then
lastly you get this little eyeshadow
brush but my favorite part is just the
package to the
then we have the holiday you set that is
$49 and it comes in this packaging which
is just stunning the theme with this
whole thing is you get for individual
palettes and you can pop it into your
one to go palette right here they're
chunky lip pencil as well as a mini of
their mascara so I like the color
arrangement in the set I think they're
all neutral with their blush which is
always amazing I love love their blushes
but I'm gonna test out these eyeshadows
and let you guys know what I think about
them but I think 50 bucks for like for
eyeshadow pallete mascara and a lippy is
a pretty good deal especially you can
keep the box because it's so gorgeous so
something I want to mention to you guys
it's kind of from the drugstore and I
say kind of cuz it's from Target but
this is pixie Beauty which in my book I
still consider drugstore makeup was the
only place I know to get it it's at the
drugstore or like Target or like on
their website it is actually their
natural contour kit why is it called a
contour kit when there's eyeshadow in a
24 bucks so this is another affordable
gift which if you tied a little ribbon
around it and gave it as the money would
have been super cute it comes with six
eyeshadows I guess these are eyeshadows
down here too and then a highlight a
blush and some bronzers to contour and
highlight your face with so it's just
like an all-in-one little holiday set
and I think it's super cute from pixie
to things and I'm obsessed with from
shuwei that I think again our beautiful
holiday said so this is their brush set
I believe this brush set is $75 case
right here which it looks like an
eyeglasses case which you can use as
your eyeglass case and then you get like
their these are like silver but they
kinda like rose gold the handles of the
brushes so you get a powder brush I
would use this one for contour and this
one for highlight and flip the brushes
over and pop the lids off oh yeah yeah I
did that right I was like be that wrong
you get three eyeshadow brushes so you
get a big blending brush a medium
blending brush and just like a mini
little this could be a lip brush I would
probably use this for my lip products
that from anyway this is like a $25 set
it comes in this gorgeous little it's
not so key like a suede bag and it's her
loose highlighter and it comes also with
the
rush so you get the highlighter and the
brush together and a cute little bag I
should have mentioned this with stocking
stuffers but I didn't but this would be
a super cute stocking stuffer well Rock
cosmetics of course they came out with
our mega Pro palette which I highly
recommend to you guys because I think
that palette is so awesome and you could
come up with 25,000 different makeup
looks with that palette along there's so
many great colors in it also they did
come out with their lip glosses so you
get six different full-size lip glosses
for 25 90 so for like 26 bucks it's a
pretty good deal if you're a lipgloss
gal these look like none of these have
shimmer in it and honestly that's like
right up my alley just because I don't
typically typically do the shimmery lip
rocks eyeliners are like top of the line
this is one of their strong points with
products in my opinion I love a good
lorac eyeliner and so they now are
selling the set for 30 and you get four
you get a black a charcoal a gold and a
silver eyeliner from Kaplan AMD they
have like the most sophisticated nice
skincare line so amazing especially with
their lip products and they're super
knowledgeable about being protective of
the Sun love that about them with my
dermatology background because you guys
know I am a dermatologist I'm just
kidding don't believe everything you
hear on the internet I used to work for
a dermatologist and you get the lip mask
which actually comes with the mask and
like a gloss and like a spatula and then
you get their firming facial mask
I hope these things we're gonna be like
this big and now I'm opening them
full-size holy Sh I stop it's the old
part your face that cost 48 bucks and
here is what the little ol looks like
right here and it just takes a drop to
cover your whole facial area Ashley I
mean if you say here to the end of the
video I gave you a high five I want to
talk about the big per se Beauty set
this one is my favorite of course
because it's the biggest one but this
isn't one is $54 and it comes with the
facial cleanser the ultimate pear cream
the hydrating mist the facial radiance
pad hide your firm sleeping cream so
it's like the whole shebang from first
name Beauty stuff is full-size that
comes in the set if you're just
want to tinker with some new skincare
then I would definitely get something
like this for the holidays lastly I have
one more set from first day Beauty I
want to share with you guys this is a
$32 set which comes with their ultra
Repair Cream and then it comes with
their facial wash as well as a lip
therapy so face wash night cream and
then a lippy put all over your face that
is the holiday babe residence oh I hope
