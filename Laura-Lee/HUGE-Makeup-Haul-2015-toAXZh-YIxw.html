video it's going to be a big fat
humongous makeup ha I have done so many
different goodies in the middle and I
was like opening packages not a bad
thing not complaining but it's just hard
to share it all with you guys so I
figured I would just do a dedicated home
video and just share it all with you one
there are a lot of new things coming out
on the market and I have got them in and
I just want to talk about them I want to
swatch them for you on it
what's that curl doing and by the way I
am sweating bullets over here okay I'm
gonna talk about I want to share once
you want to let you know about them and
we're gonna do that in this video so be
sure to give it a thumbs up if you do
enjoy the video and let's get started
it's like overtaking my life okay we're
gonna get started hearts I'm gonna talk
about these bracelets which are just the
cutest thing ever I actually just got
them in the mail so just talking about
them but they're just a bunch of
different colors you can buy them
individually they come in a bazillion
different colors you can buy sets of
them they're so cute and dainty these
are handmade bracelets and so there are
good cost and I really wanted to share
them for you on that point they help
provide full-time jobs for local
artisans in Costa Rica's and they
support over 165 charities what that's
crazy
I'm super excited about the bracelets
and I think they're the cutest thing the
world and a really funny story really
quick about them is the fact that I went
home to Alabama and one of my cousins
had them on their wrist and I was like
yes they're so cute you know yeah so
that's how I discovered them but I just
think they're the most precious thing in
the world and it came with a cute little
sticker and also they have like an
Instagram I'll put right here if you buy
the bracelets you can tag them you know
let them see your bracelets and I
mentioned they're waterproof so they
have like a nice coating on them which
keeps them protected from the water so
they won't go bad and you can just keep
them on and wear them forever and
apparently this is all my nice ones for
her birthday so I'm the cool aunt all
right what is next next is this fund
which is a mystery sponge because it
came in the milk for me and it works
better than the Beauty Blender I repeat
this bunch right here works better than
the Beauty Blender especially
you get it damn it is so friggin soft
and it came with no frickin website so I
don't even know where it's from but I'll
find the website to it I hope I can if I
can I'm sorry but I'm gonna look really
hard to see where this came from and
I'll link it down below but I don't even
know if these are expensive or cheap I
don't know anything about them I just
know they're freaking awesome so I
wanted to share it with you I said bard
came in my sit Barda is in my monthly
subscription which is 14.95 a month and
I get to get a new perfume a month and
it is in this little side so it's like a
month's worth of perfume but honestly I
can't even use this whole thing in a
month because it's it's pretty big and
it also comes in this like twistable
container we can throw it in your purse
and your bottle won't break and so this
month I got Juicy Couture oh the second
time I've gotten Juicy Couture they have
a bazillion perfumes to choose from on
the site so what you go online you take
a few quizzes you answer about like what
you like and then yeah you get your
little perfume I love sim bird I have
talked about this before on my channel
I've actually talked about that bird two
or three times sharing you guys my
monthly subscription but they did give
me a 25% off discount code is lar lar 25
if you want 20 peppers in off so check
them out it is sit bird calm birdy birdy
and I mean look how cute this is this is
a curious case a brow dilemmas by
Benefit Cosmetics this came in the mail
for me and it's like a pop-up book which
makes me so happy to like be alive right
now I don't know why it's so happy and
it even has little I mean like this is
like a little kids dream book so it's
mine but it has all these little flat
B's we'll get to the good stuff and then
inside it has this nice mirror as well
as old thing older brow products which
included the brow powder the high brow
and then their brow gels which is my
favorite which is gimme brow and then oh
that was these so yeah this was the brow
gel and I think this is more Kimmy brow
so it came with a bunch it became a four
of you me brows hmm very interesting but
I just thought this was the cutest thing
ever and I want to share with you guys I
don't know that that's gonna be for sale
yeah I don't know if they're gonna be
selling the books but I know they sell
the
stuff like that alter they have brow
bars can you go get your brows done I'm
going to talk about this little booger
right here from Sigma so this came in
the mail from me this is through washing
that and you're like we've already heard
about both it's it's the smaller one -
it costs less and I highly recommend the
smaller one over the bigger one one it's
just easier to store and use and two you
don't need one that's that big and three
it's cheaper this is only 25 bucks and I
think this is well worth 25 bucks
it is awesome so you just like stick it
is suction to your sink turn on your
water use your favorite brush cleaner
and you just slip while your brushes
around um I love the cleaning mat so
much so I would get the $25 one if I was
gonna get any of them blow the new lorac
mega pro 2 so believe it or not I didn't
even get the first one of these so I
never got to use it but I did get this
it did show up in the mail for me and
I'm just like so thankful because it is
so beautiful it's what I have on my eyes
today I'm gonna be doing a get ready
with me using it so stay tuned for that
it is the prettiest palette I am so in
love with the colors I mean you get a
lot of matte colors and then you get a
whole lot of shimmer colors I would say
it's half and half but also I mean I'm
gonna be honest with you this is not the
most neutral palette in the world but I
kind of like that because I feel like
every palette that's coming out mouths
like neutral neutral neutral let's break
it up a little bit so you get some
Purple's some warm tone shades some
blues and then you get a few neutrals in
here but not too many so if you're super
neutral ground I don't know this is
gonna be the palette for you but I think
this is a gorgeous palette the quality
of the colors are outstanding as they
always are and I wanted to share it with
you X oh my gosh can you believe I
haven't even opened it yet this is the
vice palette I can't believe I went to
an Urban Decay even and we got the vice
palettes there it was actually for the
launch of the vice palette haven't even
opened it haven't even swatch the colors
I honestly don't know what to tell you
about it if it's any good I've heard of
mixed reviews on the palette but the
colors look gorgeous I mean it is super
spunky little palette here as the vice
palettes typically are but I just can't
get past the packaging the packaging is
just all that in a nutshell it is so
freaking cool it comes with a
double-ended brush as well so that's
pretty nice but occasionally supplies us
with that brush
then from Smashbox I got the Smashbox
camera-ready BB water and I've never
tried this and I've seen stuff about it
and I don't even know that much about it
but I got medium and light medium I'll
probably be light medium but I'm excited
to use it from what I understand you're
supposed to add a drop of the water
formula supposed to wear this stuff
alone or mix it with something I'm gonna
have to do my research maybe watch a few
videos on it and then I'll let you guys
know what I think about it but I got two
of these it's another new cool product
out on the market I have to wonder if
it's gonna be like the cover of eggs
those drops from them I wonder if it's
similar I don't know alright next from
morphe I got their small contour brushes
as well as a few other these are so
freakin cute I don't know what to do I
don't know why I love anything mini but
I do I love mini everything and these
look amazing to contour with like you
could just out that cheek and get
yourself those mouth decent cheeks for
days and I'm obsessed but these little
brushes are the cutest so this is the
m45 9 and this is the m45 8 the 5/8 is a
little bit smaller than the v 9 then I
got some lashes in which I'm wearing a
pair already because I just couldn't
resist it myself
it is the art mmm it's gonna be fun
pronouncing this our team is I don't
even want to try to pronounce this you
know what I'm not even going to I'll put
the text of what they are right here
we're in a roll with it these are
gorgeous now they are mink lashes they
are super pretty the packaging is like
this velvet inside and are like suede
filling and stuff it comes in this nice
leather packaging with a suede inside
and then you get your gorgeous lashes
and did I mention it comes the box comes
in a velvet case wrapped up in a ribbon
I mean this is like luxury to its
fullest degree with these lashes but I'm
very excited
where I'm I'm wearing a pair right now
and they are gorgeous Eckstrom lamb come
I got this little cute makeup bag it
says drama for days and I got a little
note that was really cute and sweety and
then I go I ball I like it and then
there's some skin care in this bag which
I mean
why anyways I got their Hypnose drama
mascara let's see the wand looks
interesting looks like a DNA cell which
is a weird way to describe it but call
it like I see it and then I got this bag
full of ribbon and colorful eyeliners
that I am so it's like the coolest color
eyeliner some are matte some are white
some are bright yellow oh my goodness
they're super super creamy so this is
gonna be like a heyday playing in
eyeliners maybe I'll get really creative
with a makeup look and I got the new
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
which I have heard of raved about on the
YouTube community and I got shade 155
and this like it's gonna be my shade now
I never wear stick foundations
it just feels heavy normally to me but
I'm so tempted to fall in love with this
because I've seen so many good things
said about it I haven't tried it yeah I
just watched it on my hand and it like
blends out to a creamy nice foundation
it's not like cake I don't know I feel
like I'm gonna fall in love with it but
I haven't used it yet it absolutely
cannot wait to try it so I assume I have
the Ultra HD in liquid form and I assume
this is the exact same formula but stick
form alright so that is it for this haul
video I hope you guys enjoy the video it
was a lot of me rambling on about all
these new products but I just have a
share with you guys I love you guys
thanks for being here and I hope to see
you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
