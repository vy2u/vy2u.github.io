channel today's video is going to be
very exciting because holy moly I don't
think I've ever had this any big PR
packages tend to be on once in my life
the reason I have so many worked up is
because I recently went to Marrakesh
with YSL beauty and yeah the boxes just
came on in and I wasn't opening them
because I was at home so I was like what
a great time to appear in PR unboxing
video I snapchat it all the boxes
stacked up in my kitchen you guys are
like paint to paint ok ok ok why does
everything I do have to be a chance I
don't know anyways this video is going
to get longer than so much to go through
but I want to put out there a friendly
reminder that makeup companies send over
free PR for free marketing these videos
can go out to hundreds of thousands of
people and make of a shared oh and they
don't I'm not being paid so it's free
marketing it's free advertising and that
is the incentive there if you're
wondering how that works I've worked
very hard to get to the place of that am
I in my career PR did I not come in like
this whenever I start at YouTube Point
Blank and period because it wasn't as
big as a marketing thing as it is today
and I think it's really cool because I
get to use the products paste into me to
review give an honest review of how I
feel about them on my channel and you
guys get to see the T on the makeup
without further ado the sky cam came
through and let's go ahead jump right in
okay I have boxes stacked if I can
trying to go through but first I have
boxes stuck on the ground to open it
show my address law geniuses don't show
up at my house now do you are Christian
