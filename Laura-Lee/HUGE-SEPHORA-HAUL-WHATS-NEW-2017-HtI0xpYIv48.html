math justice for all now the whole bag
doesn't look that big but don't let that
deceive you look about loads of stuff in
here and also out of you think you
listen to me NPR then I'm going to share
with you guys that are at Sephora that I
think are definitely worth sharing with
you but I didn't buy it because it was
sent to me so but I probably would've
bought it if it wasn't sent to me so I
still want to share it with you guys but
I did buy myself to a marvelous girl
okay so anyways we're going to jump
right anything it started don't forget

so we're going to go ahead and jump
right in this video okay it is been so
long since I've been in Sephora haul why
I don't know okay
I tend been sharing with you guys my
goodies I got Sephora but the first
thing that I got is the Kevin of Kuan
neo bronzer and I didn't get the one
that I wanted because it was out of
stock in the store I went to Sephora
Beverly Hills which is huge and fabulous
but the packaging is so pretty it's like
ombre maroon and black and then this is
what it looks like there was something
in my eye
it supposed to be a bronzer blush and
highlight and oh this one's so good they
feel like butter and they're like really
freakin pigmented of playing with this
sample in the store they have one that
has a peach blush in the middle and
that's the one that I really wanted but
it was not soft because everybody else
wanted it too apparently these still so
good I cannot wait to freakin use this
palette
it looks amazing I love how it's like
ombre across I'm going to see how that
plays out whenever putting it into youth
and it is it a really nice compact with
a mirror so I can't wait to use it it is
so nice and sweet one of the things I
bought isn't very stable support it what
is cheap in there
next of all something would come forward
so I've never owned anything from
telling for what I've used some of this
products there were other people's I
used Geoffrey stars in his calamities
Mac - in our class so I just went using
other people stuff but I finally got
some my own so I bought the Tom for this
isn'ta primer that I was like dying to
get but this is a bronzing powder the
packaging is just gold honey
literally but I used it today actually
and then I put it back in the box
because it's so special
very bronzing I like the packaging it's
like all foam today and you turn the lid
it pops out I'm using a little Garnier
face lights these are really good by the
way
so I want to show you guys there's a
little pump of it and it really I mean
it really bronzed up my skin and I love
a blonde space to start off my makeup I
love looking tan in the face whenever I
got back from Bora Bora so many people
were like you look so good I don't know
what it is I'm like this because I got a
tan this it felt really nice and smooth
it felt a little bit hydrating it didn't
have shimmer in it it was almost like a
matte bronze finish and it really bronze
my skin so I feel very scared this may
be a little harsh of a bronzer on you I
don't know that for a fact but it's just
a pretty bold bronzer for a primer and
if my skin was much lighter than it is
it might contrast a little bit too much
make me look a little orange but I'm not
I mean I love it I love it I love it
next I bought the cap on the Starlight
College and I bought this because
everybody had it but made lose I bought
it in the past and I gave it to my
sister she ended up wanting it I believe
and so I was just like fine take mine
but everybody has raved about it and it
looks really pretty and nice and I want
to try it out myself so I've gotten a
chance to experiment so experiment
experiment experiment experiment was
much Kat Von D makeup so how do we
testing this out leave your comments
down below on your thoughts did it work
out for you did it not work out for you
what do you think about the shade light
palette if you try it out next so I
bought something fun
while being Rome I bought they bought it
shadow and long wear gel eyeliner
palette and packaging golden palm saying
and the palette was had a fancy price
tag on it too but should I drop the
paper still wanted it I mean that's like
so luxe and pretty and then you open it
and to be honest with you I wasn't like
screaming over the shades and the
palette just because they're so neutral
feel like these shades are in a hundred
palettes and I definitely have the shade
coming they're nothing new or
extraordinary but these little cream gel
eyeliners aren't are misty however I
didn't really think this through because
I haven't had much luck with Barbie
brown liners however that washed
beautifully and what I've done in the
past if I you had used gel eyeliners as
like an eyeshadow base so their shimmery
Brown this one looks like it ate one I
hope it's not something black it looks
like it would be like a green it and
then the last one is a black which my
black Bobby Brown eyeliner I didn't have
much luck with just little black little
mini eyeliner they're so cute shadows so
okay nothing I paid the matte still
beautiful shimmers are nice too so the
ice is nice
this was my point I got the lamb blow
little beanie insider if you're not part
of Beauty Insider you get points really
line stuff and you get free little
goodies inside here I'm pretty sure to
try to all these by the way some such a
Glanville junkie and if I'm not mistaken
which I might be so don't go quote me on
Twitter but I think we're going to
number one skincare line in Sephora so
you go girl if that's true
anyways I tried just before this is
thirsty mud to hydrate your skin this is
the mud to foam mask so if you're
dealing with acne this is a face wash
and you massage this in your can leave
it on for five minutes and wash it off
and shower it can really cut down on the
acne this is probably their best selling
mask this is super mud and this mask is
so good a good big pores or if you're
doing with acne
and literally help so much and then this
is you smud it's like anti-aging my math
I've done it a few times and I really
enjoyed it
so everything in there I loved in a
travel size and I'm traveling shoulder
bounce back that lighting art out but I
am traveling so much and I need little
things like that
next I brought something I consider be a
priest stupid person but I didn't
realize this was $36 I want a mini Tom
Ford lipstick and it was a $36 hell this
is called Evan and the color is the
exact same color of stripped-down lip
liner by Mac it's like the lipstick
color but I thought 36 with surprise for
the big one I think the big one for like
50 but I still love it and then using it
actually use it twice but it's good I
can't use it too many times because then
I won't have it anymore
this on the Tom Ford lipstick Evan oh so
freakin pretty well you do this to me oh
my I bought I bought two more things
another thing I bought with the Marc
Jacobs this is a velvet new aura mascara
this is one of my favorite mascaras on
the planet it is so good and I needed a
backup here's my old crusty one and it
was getting a little dry so I needed
this I just love this up here I like
grabs my lashes and coats them within
like one or two slides it's so good and
then I saw Katie Holmes on her Instagram
I think this is what she bought so it's
going on snapchat and so I bought it so
it might be good this is the Brazilian
bumbum cream helps tine and smooth like
no other the staff is ordering body
cream so this would be a body cream that
helps to tie in your skin I guess I
bought it in that little section before
the no case gives me it's literally
right whenever you check out all those
little goodies are like wow you're like
include open linens and like $50 more in
your cart so that's what I bought and
I'm gonna show you some things in PR
that came and
at I wanna share with you so the persons
at Urban Decay after dark palette I
adore the packaging and then you open it
up and it is a really pretty palette I
was hoping for maybe like I don't know
some matte so you can make it a complete
palette but typically whenever I speak
talents like this I look at them and say
this is the palette with some cool
shimmery shades in it do I want to do
some funky looks do I already have
eyeshadow palettes that have all my
transition shades that I'll need because
this palette I won't be able to do a
complete look alone with and those are
the things that go through my mind to
ask you know is it worth the money I
think it's a really pretty palette and
really cool it's just there's no like
mass in it or transition shades the
eyeshadows are Urban Decay eye shadows
they're just extremely pigmented it
makes me want to do a really fun makeup
look right now
okay the next palette that I got is the
skin twinkle volume 2 palette from Tarte
and it is their highlighter palette
which is so pretty oh oh I'm not taking
it well yeah this palette mm-hmm so good
it's so pretty and then you get a really
light shade and then like of this candle
light shade literally that's the candle
it shows like a little golden oh my gosh
these are unreal I highly highly highly
highly recommend this palette this is so
nice I didn't get the first one this is
volume 2 this is my first one of these
and I adore it text on from chart is
there rain fourth of the C volume to
palette so they have another palette is
very similar to this one and this one is
very cool toned and the pigmentation is
almost the exact same as the highlighter
palette it's it's so pretty these are
all shimmers no I think just like one or
two maps in here but this is such a
pretty palette how friggin pretty is
that I'm screaming right now
more of a warm to home type of girl you
might not like this tile this much but I
think it's so pretty from make it
forever I want to share with you they're
highlighters I'm all about the
highlights
this is Oh to the golden one have a
smart fit yet so it looks really pretty
done the packaging that's a swatch of it
it's so frickin pretty oh and then I
also got the first one which is a
lighter pink more pinky tone that's this
iPad sitting right here making noise and
I wish you would shut its little face
Shay a little bit this one's a little
more pinky toned it's much lighter oh my
gosh that is so pretty
you know it's weird I sound like these
like the makeup forever Broncos that was
in this packaging and had this design I
felt like they were so compacted in the
packaging you couldn't get your
pigmentation out of the bees like a
couple flights and it's like so
pigmented I don't know they switch
something up but they're different and
they're better I would say so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
