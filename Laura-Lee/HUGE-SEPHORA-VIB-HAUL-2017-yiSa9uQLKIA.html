like I just can't wait for you guys see
what else the brand Laura Lee Los
Angeles has in store for you that being
said I think we can now go ahead and
sing the special little
 you
and now let's go ahead and jump right
you know what I was thinking about when
I woke up this morning Lauren get your
ass up and get to Christmas shopping
oh my god I have to stop buying things
for myself it's start buying things
other people because Christmas time is
lurking and it is time to start
Christmas shopping every year I'm like
I'm gonna start Christmas shopping in
July and now I by zombie simmer comes
I'm 100% ready and I want to worry about
any of the madness and then I never do
it so yeah I got it I gotta start
Christmas shopping anyways let's get
start it into the hole the first thing
that I bought I bought a makeup forever
let's just I should palette why don't I
buy this I don't know because I don't
have an imaginative house I guess but I
was super excited about it so here she
is this is the first time between this
bad boy really cool packaging and it
feels like it's feels like jelly on top
let's go ahead and open her up oh the
lid just comes right off okay Oh weird
it's like look the whole like palette oh
do I love this or not I don't know if I
love this like it just like comes out on
phone okay well there's that and it has
quite a few of my favorite shades in it
and it also has a bunch of cool toned
Browns in it so I can't wait to play
with this makeup forever has really nice
shadows so this is like super
interesting to me the fact that that's
fun it just comes out I don't know if
I'm confused I don't know if I love it
or hate it but we'll play with this
palette the lustrous eyeshadow palette
next up I bought something from Givenchy
and this is a powder I'm really into
trances and powders because the thing is
with them like I have to use them every
single time I do my makeup so I'm really
into finding the best one so far I
really love Laura Mercier cover of bags
and to Fable Too Faced Born This Way a
cedral those are some of the best I get
asked all the time what's the best
setting powders and those just have no
wrong as well as the Charlotte Tilbury
press setting powder that's a really
good one so the packaging looks like
this little square and this is a
universal nude setting powder and you
turn it like a lot you get your spongy
poo it's super soft and then it comes
out and the typical is you're benching
geez like the powder comes down like
that let's open it up boom bitch oh my
god I'm about to be so pissed this is
like one of those powdery ass flashback
translucent powders girl that's ugh I
thought this was gonna be like a Laura
Mercier situation you can definitely
tell the difference between the ones
that flashback like it can fill them and
I can look at I'll be like that's a
flashback one like this is gonna so
hardcore flashback it has like those
crystals in it that's a light reflects
and it just mm-hmm it's a flashback
powder so I might return that actually
next up I got the prism palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and I know I
opened this in PR but I actually bought
this one because one of my family
members really really really wanted it
and I got a PR so I just sent them mine
and so I revolve one for myself you know
so this is my second one and I think the
palette is really pretty it looks like
this has a little double ended brush in
it and yeah Isis has a bunch of unique
colors in it that I think are really
pretty and I'm really excited about so
bada-bing bada-boom and their packaging
I wonder they're gonna start doing all
their palettes velvet because they did
modern ROSAT subculture and now prison
and the dull bit kind of the similar
packaging so I wonder if this is just
their new theme all velvet packaging I
like it and I think that the print on
this one is really really cool
no I feel like the shades are creative
so I want to create a cool look with
this no one's just gonna rebuy it
because I want it to
I bought two things and from fifty I did
not get the eyeshadow palette because it
is moon dust eyeshadows like
kay ones i swatched him there and
honestly I have so many of those I
should have palettes like to face just
came out with one and urban came a
million of theirs and I have enough of
those and the palettes kind of pricey so
I was like hmm
I won't get this because I should want
to use it so I just didn't think it was
worth the money but the lip glosses is
something I really don't have something
exactly like this and they look super
super pretty like super shiny super
pretty so I definitely wanted these and
thought that these were a little more
work than something I didn't have
already this one is called girl what is
your name gal on the mood it's like this
purpley color and then I bought a second
one because I thought they were both
really pretty this one's like more of a
maroon the other one's more purpley and
then this one is called Astro naughty
super cute definitely won't be everyday
lippies for me look at that powder but
for a cool look or looks like a really
cool moment I think these are really
pretty damn ones darker I'm excited to
wear these so I think they're really
cool the one day out of the week that I
don't wear nude lip I will wear one of
those next up I bought like one of the
best things ever organs sent me this
product a while ago and it is the spot
remover it's an acne gel treatment and
this is pretty much a little miracle gel
and they only had one left in Sephora I
went to and I snatched this bitch up oh
my girl it says man don't fight someone
for it so basically this is a little
spot remover acne treatment and if you
have like one big zit and you just pop
this product on it at night it will
literally reduce it by like 50% for the
next day I mean it's just like a miracle
spot remover and I absolutely have to
have this like five is it I'm just
dotting it on there and it reduces it
and it like helps the redness and all
the swelling to go down in the zit it's
a lifesaver and I think I lost mine in
the move Louis my first time coming in
video and my name is epyck Izzy I was
like okay I need a repurchase I would
have bought two of them honestly if they
had to Battalion one smells like Max and
then when I was at Sephora I didn't have
any makeup on there and indeed was like
hey
I'm doing a free facial you were
fresh-faced why not you know what
sometimes I really don't want a facial
but sometimes in life I'm just like just
say yes just do it Ted yes and I did it
I mean he was such a sweet guy and it
gave me a little facial with all his
Kate Somerville products and then he
sold me on this kit which hopefully I'll
end up liking but I bought a 75 $75 Kate
Somerville kit it has the exfoliating
cleanser it has the moisture glow and
then this actually this is the soft gel
cleanser and then this one is the
exfoliating cleanser and so the kid is
worth 127 I bought it for 75 bucks
I've skin care coming out of my a-hole
and then I got talked into buying more
skin care I think it could be a really
good kid got a free little Christmas
vote on it I'll probably give it to a
family member but it's my sister and mom
loved tote bags they're like bag whores
they can never have enough I got some
Sunday Riley which is a really boozy
skincare brand
brightening serum so I actually tried
this out little samples if they don't
give you samples at Sephora go you
better say you got some samples cuz
they'll drop them in your bags I got the
milk makeup holographic powder duo Space
Jam so this is a highlighter quad and it
has four highlighters it's a holographic
I definitely whoa they feel so creamy
they're definitely not holographic
Christine was simply not logical
would be screaming right now hopefully
not hollow but they are very pretty and
the highlights feel super super creamy
so they have a nice texture to them I
think they're super cool galaxy colors
like the blue the pink the purple one
like a yellow and they just feel like
super wet and creamy
whenever you rub them like a good
quality can never help myself I wasn't
this in PR this is the Lily lashes
lashes is now in oh she's an itch Billy
lashes is now gonna be in Sephora and
they came out with this Sephora
collection kit I'm gonna open it so you
get two pairs of their her lashes and
these kind of like a softer like eye
and then these little more wispy kind of
like Miami and then you get a lash
applier it's a metal lash thing to help
you apply them on that hangs onto the
lashes at the end right here I don't
know I think the kit is really cute and
these lot just looks super nice so I'll
definitely be wearing both of these
pairs I'm wearing Lily lashes in Miami
right now
I wear Miami every day they're like my
favorite lashes I got this really cool
holiday kit which I think will be at
Sephora I'm like pretty sure by Smashbox
and it opens so we're gonna see what
Smashbox has to offer us
for $25 had to be legendary lipstick kit
with the insta map mattifier they're all
minis and they all have like holiday at
packaging and they are really cute so
it'll be 25 bucks so these are a little
bit glossy and that's when they put the
instant matte in there in case you want
it to make the lipsticks not logg see
