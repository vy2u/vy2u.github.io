sometimes I like to skip through videos
when girls be talking too much this is
not an affiliate thing I just partnered
with Ulta to get back to you guys so I
hope you enjoy it okay
hang on I mean so many makeup companies
coming out with the most amazing stuff
and I'm gonna be sharing with you some
of the stuff that I've gotten the first
thing that I have been just absolutely
loving is this I don't know if it's new
I actually don't think it is new this is
the tint oh man this is what is Lancome
German French this is French so anyways
it's the ultra wear makeup stick it has
sunscreen in it this is from Lancome I
am wearing this one today I am in shade
260 bisque in for neutral I believe and
these are extremely extremely
lightweight but yet they smooth on like
so smooth it feels like it almost turns
into like a little powder whenever you
put it on your skin because that's how
lightweight it is and they do have nice
coverage to them I haven't worn them
long enough to tell you like if they get
greasy or cakey throughout the day so I
don't know and I don't want to tell you
that if I don't know how to bring 10%
for sure this is the second day wearing
it and I think it looks beautiful on the
skin next up I didn't get to talk about
this palette on my channel yet and I
think it's so important to support other
people in this industry on YouTube and
graveyard girl who is the most unique
encouraging confident self-esteem
boosting good person that I can think of
on the internet and she came out with a
palette in collaboration with Tarte it
is called the graveyard girl swamp Queen
palette and look a little alligator it's
so cute and the packaging is absolutely
adorable
so the palette looks like this you also
get a bronzer a highlight and a blush as
well as non different national shades
and this guy broke on me sippy sippy
brow so it's a little mixed in over here
with sassy bun but that's okay you know
I'm still gonna create a cool look with
it and rock it I don't know if it's sold
out at all so but I just thought I would
mention it to you because I don't know
like if it's gonna come back in stock if
it's not I just wanna let you know it is
sold at Ulta was sold at Ulta might
still be sold at Ulta but I want to talk
about it this Smashbox blush and
highlight palette this is Malibu berry
and this is actually called La Lights
palette I've never used a Smashbox blush
and then I started swatching these and
they were phenomenal I just I really
loved the arrangement of colors in them
this one is like a shimmery highlight
like blush topper one and then you have
a matte bright pink and then a little
bit of a matte berry color
I think this palette is so pretty okay
next something that everybody's been
really excited about I post a picture
this on my Instagram and everybody's
having a hissy fit because it's so
pretty
this is a new glow hid from Anastasia
Beverly Hills this one is in Sun dipped
and this one is a little bit more of a
bronze versions compared to her other
one I think the quality of these is just
as good as her other ones and the pans
are enormous they're huge so the one
shade that I've been using the most is
summer I've used this one so much it's
my favorite out of the palette I don't
know about these two because I haven't
used these two at all only swatch them
my finger just accidentally tapped it
and look at that where's your sunglasses
at blinding I typically don't use bronze
highlights as much I typically like my
bronze things to be matte on my face and
then my highlights to be shimmers but
I'm gonna tinker with it
it's beautiful another palette I want to
talk about that that Ulta is the modern
renaissance palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills I love the packaging it's
velvet and this pretty mommy pink color
and then when you open it up it is very
warm toned however I thought it was way
lighter or brighter whenever I saw it
online when I got it in person it was a
little bit of more of a deeper mommy
colors and what I thought that was just
like such a warm tone palette but
actually like I don't know they're kind
of like I have a little bit of coolness
in it I absolutely love that I'm
actually wearing the palette on my eyes
today and they are crazy pigmented okay
next up from pure I got some items which
I haven't tried yet but I can't wait to
first it's the afterglow highlight from
pure clearly I'm all about eyeshadow
palettes and highlights look how pretty
so this is a lighter highlight I think
this one would look very nice on a
lighter skin tone I mean I think anyone
could rock it but I think it would
really complement a lighter skin tone
because of how light it is I'm gonna try
it out and see how it looks on my skin
tone I don't know yet but this is their
Africa
right and I know that it feels very
powdery but yet very pigmented it
doesn't feel a wet creamy feels like
really lightweight and powdery but I
can't wait to try it out and then the
correcting primer which looked really
good pure has like a full skincare line
that's really awesome and so I want to
start using more they're like face
products like their primer and
foundation and stuff like that this is a
correcting primer but it's also
illuminating primer so I don't think
this is gonna be a friend of anyone with
oily skin but if you have dry skin or
normal skin the illuminating factor can
be really pretty to give you like a
glowy finish to your skin again I
haven't tried it out yet I will try it
out and tell you guys my thoughts that
it looks really pretty and I can't wait
to play with it from Smashbox I got
there full exposure mascara oh yeah I've
tried this one before and this is a
really good mascara it has a nice big
fat chunky brush on it and I really like
it a lot
but I do really like Smashbox full
exposure mascara I meant to show you
this with a Smashbox blush palette but I
get a little crazy and I'm all over the
place so I'm just I'll showing you it
but this is a good mascara trying it out
before okay
Too Faced is coming out with brow
quickie and these are supposed to be
like a brow gel but they have little
fibers in it they're supposed to mimic
brow hairs to give you your brows a
little bit of a thickening since say
Shawn I believe benefit and NYX has a
similar product which I'm excited for
the brow game a two-faced to be amped up
but it comes on this little spooley
which I love when brow products come on
little spool ease because I feel like it
doesn't get all over your face and your
eyebrows don't end up being caterpillar
fighting for the middle this is brush on
brow fiber cream and I'm excited about
it I will probably be the deeper shade
it looks like they're going to come out
with two shades a lighter one and a
darker one the darker one is Universal
brunette and this one's a universal
taupe for my Blondie's out there that is
it for this old AHA hope you guys enjoy
