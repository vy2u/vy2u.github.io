going to be a very exciting video that's
a big humungous Victoria's Secret haul
for you guys I know you guys as favorite
videos are haul videos so I cannot wait
to share with you all the goodies that I
got we're definitely gonna be talking
about the new victoria secret fantasies
spray collection yeah I am such a
Victoria Secret in chunky you guys know
my love for them is unreal so we're
shooting jump right in where to get
started
yeah so let's do is there is nothing
like bringing home the big pink bag we
talked about the tissue paper guys a
always used to save the tissue paper and
always used to wrap presents and like we
use the tissue paper whenever I had like
a baby shower to go to or birthday
present
they always got Victoria's Secret tissue
paper I think I'm going to start doing
that again we're gonna talk about person
this haul video is the new collection of
victoria's secret fantasies of body
sprays hello look at this new bottle I
know you're like what is that I don't
know what that is this is the body
sprays the fantasies collection and they
have this nice new sleek clean beautiful
looking bottle I love the big gold heavy
lid on it and it's just a little spritz
bottle as well they have 19 different
fragrances you have all day to pick out
your fragrances I'm gonna talk to you
guys about the fragrances I'm going to
talk to you guys about mixing them ooh
and I'll kind of go over each scent and
tell you which ones have my favorite and
then I have some clothes and some other
sets I'm gonna share with you from
Victoria's Secret and I just want to go
ahead and let you guys know that these
are a new formula so they're not going
to be the same formula as you're used to
they actually last way longer than the
actual old formula what I've come out
with some new scents and I'm gonna be
talking to you guys about so yeah these
are so much fun because you don't
actually have to use just one of them
you can mix them and kind of create your
own thing customize what you like about
these I know as for me I whenever I
bought these they always have deals and
I would never buy just one of them but I
would never be able to use up a whole
bottle so I would mix and match this
scent and they smell so good and you can
just kind of customize and see what
smells good together
I'll add you guys had a couple of my
favorite mixtures first one I'll talk
about here is romantic romantic it's
such a sweet floral Lisa
it I think it being the color pink
describes it perfectly because I think a
pink flower whenever I smell this one it
is so good and so feminine next we'll
talk about kiss which is in this purple
bottle here and this reminds me of it's
a little bit floral II but it has like a
little bit of a touch of vanilla in it I
think this is one of the most unique
smells out of all of them personally I
do love it a lot and I believe this one
is gonna be awesome to mix with other
body spray next let's talk about rush
and I have to go ahead and let you know
the rush is one of my all-time favorites
I love the blue color but just because
it's something different and not only
that it smells super fruity I love
pretty sense it's kind of what I opted
for most the time oh it smells so good I
honestly will wear this one alone all
day long I'm obsessed
the next one is dream which is this aqua
color and it is very clean smell it's
not too heavy it is a little bit floral
but it just has that nice clean fresh
scent to it the next one is a pure
seduction i'ma go ahead let you know
that I've been wearing pure seduction
for a long time I have always been a
huge fan of this one I think this is the
sexiest smell I think if you're going on
a date are you gonna smell sexy I don't
know what it is about pure seduction but
you will seductive made you want in your
life okay very powerful smell to it
oh so sexual oh yes boss
we have sheer love and this is probably
the most floral e one out of all of them
has a very sweet flowery scent I should
say floral sama to making up things now
and this is probably one of the most
girly sweet ones out of the whole entire
collection is that it gives a little bit
any difference and I'm gonna recommend
this one to you if you are not for the
floral juicy fruity scents and you want
to smell you want to get perfume scent
on you I hire come an exotic for you
might be a little bit of a beachy scent
but again it's not like fruity girly
girly girly so but it is a very nice
scent and this is another one that is
super nice to layer up with some others
lastly I have total attraction to share
with you guys this one is probably one
of the most strong ones it is very girly
and very fruity almost laura-leigh but
again it is very strong it doesn't take
much of this one and remember the
formulas do last much longer than the
year pass formulas I was eight of the 19
nuisance so there are so many to choose
from but my all-time favorite is pure
seduction and rush I don't personally
like to mix these two I do like to wear
these two alone but they are just my
face so check these out if you're in
Victoria's Secret's give them a snip
okay if use it smell so good mixed
together is romance and kiss these are
like two peas in a pod they smell so
good together so these are awesome okay
and then I really love mixing sheer love
and exotic because sheer love is super
feminine and girly and then this one's a
little bit clean but if you mix them
together they create this bomb scent so
I'm all about mixing these two yes FYI
exotic and rush hour two of their new
sins next I want to share with you guys
the new next step I have some of the
fragrances in the mini mini little
misters so these are amazing for travel
they come in these nice little bottles
right here and it's not a rollerball I
mean it kind of looks like it might be
rollerball but as a spray which is very
convenient so it's like a little bit of
the spray to pop them in your purse or
if you're traveling and you don't want
to take your full-size bottle with you
hello I didn't get to talk to you guys
about vanilla lace which I really wanted
to mention it to you guys because it
smells so warm and so good and I
honestly think vanilla lace is one of
the most perfect ones for fall time
because this is such a warm beautiful
vanilla scent that coconut passion if
you are a beachy girl you just love that
coconut Eason this is gonna be the one
for you I also love love a dig which has
been around but this is another super
fruity fruity fruity scent oh it smells
so delicious can we just have a moment
talk about love spill whenever I was in
high school everybody used to bathe in
love spill before they went to school I
guess we all thought it was going to
help us get a boyfriend but literally
now so I can think about is high school
smelling this right now it smells so
good then there's secret escape which I
think this one is a little bit different
from them as well I think this one just
had I want to say that as florally but
it also has a clean scent within it so
it's just super different and I have
secret charm which if I had to be honest
with you this one seriously I just feel
like if you are sweaty or you came back
from the gym or gym
class and you needed a little spritz I
feel like this one would mix really well
with that because sometimes covering up
sweat and odor like that it doesn't end
up smelling good but I feel like this is
going to be the one that what actually
makes really well and it's just a really
nice scent so this one is secret charm
then we have passion struck this one
smells a little bit warm and it smells
fruity but at the same time it's like a
mature scent it's very strong and fruity
but it's still it's not too girly girly
it's a little bit more mature of a scent
then we have aqua kids and this one
it smells like water almost it smells
like that really clean water scent oh it
smells so delish I have sheer love and
total attraction which I already went
over these in the big size bottle that's
a little bit of rundown on all this
scent you have a little card which
recommends some to mix together and
sheer love and love spell mixed together
makes a good scent which I can just
imagine us being the best thing ever so
I'm probably going to keep these to my
person they also coconut passion and
pure seduction as a good scent oh my
gosh how unique would that be so this is
the one that I said was very sexy and
strong and then this is coconut passion
which is a little bit beaching coconut e
mixed together but there are so many
fragrances to pick from that's kind of
the whole theme of it being able to wear
more than one and makes and customize
and make what you like out of them I
love them to death I think they're
amazing I love the new packaging I
especially love the little minis for
travel check them out at Victoria's
Secret I'll have a link down below and
now I'm gonna go over some of the other
stuff that I got first I got some of
their little nightgowns which I think
are the cutest thing and can we talk
about how comfortable these are so these
were 2 for 49 to like 25 bucks apiece
you can't beat that with a stick at the
little leopard print one because I
thought it was so cute and then I got
the black-and-white striped one and then
it just says Victoria's Secret across
the front and hot pink how adorable they
are long sleeve that's one of the
reasons I wanted to get them because
wintertime and fall is on its way and I
don't want to be freezing to death and
these are just so comfortable like oh
it's led me to my next purchase which
are these absolutely adorable house
slippers which I also think these make
great gifts I love giving stuff like
this to people because who doesn't love
a fuzzy pair of house slippers they're
really cute that is great
and they say sweet dreams love these
then I got two pair of leggings from
Victoria Secrets what can I say they're
leggings are the best okay the reason I
got two is because I literally could not
pick which pair was cuter so I was like
thinking I have to get both
firstworldproblems at these like gray
ones that are like feathered or Heather
nice black and gray print and down the
leg it says vias at ten
yeah like ways that one is it backward
to my camera B is 10 these are the most
comfortable thing ever to travel in and
I have a lot of travels coming coming up
and then I got this plain gray pair ooh
I'm just calm on fire I have the cutest
little and I don't know if you can see
but it's like an iridescent in white
yeah let's see it says angel V is love
angel biggest love who you get the point
lastly the last thing I need is new
makeup bags but this is like the perfect
one for travel because I feel like it's
gonna be more sturdy than my little ones
clock ones as I move around because this
one's gonna stand up straight and it's a
lesser chance that's my makeup being
broken or up heal the broken makeups are
trouble
okay it's just so cute and girly no
picked up this but again like I said I
have a lot of travels going on so I'm so
happy I had these to carry with me and
then this for my travels and then my
legging so I'm comfortable on the plane
