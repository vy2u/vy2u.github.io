with makeup you're beating me where you
keep it hidden from them girl I know

let a child in this room do took the
camera equipment and how much things
that could go in their mouths and I
would probably have liked them there
play make kids to everything in the
mouth they say something goes in their
mouth I don't know what it is

hi I'm Laura what's the secret to having
a long successful relationship I would
say communication and trust easy was it
hard to build the confidence to start
your YouTube channel and was ty always
supportive it was really hard to the
confidence to start my channel actually
a lot of sleepless nights because anyway
I just had to do it because like I would
have an empty hole in my heart if I
didn't do it because I wanted to start
the channel so bad but at the same time
I was so shook and was just scared
shitless and I was very supportive were
you nervous that I won't support you
doing YouTube when you guys first met so
we were already together whenever I
started doing YouTube and it was also
something I would consult him on like
die help me get a camera you know I do
this so bad so he was like in the mix
with me tireless and most challenging
thing about being a husband of a you to
of me like a YouTube husband keeping up
with the busy schedule and knowing how
to separate between our work life and
our relationship with each other
