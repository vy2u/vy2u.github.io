video is going to be a review of the
absolute my phones we can never I just
cannot remember what these are called
they're called the heart lip hybrids so
these are pretty much showing viral all
over Instagram or have been for quite a
while and you guys twit me and ask me to
review them for you and tell you the
four one one on them
are they good are they bad are they sad
I don't know okay she's thirsty so I
just ordered a bunch of colors in them
and these seem to be kind of popular
colors or Marquez's because it won't
open up Oh didn't work the models on the
website have like these super beautiful
beautiful really cool looking lips on
hoping these are gonna be just as cool
as they turn out online as you guys know
a lot of times that's not the case but
sometimes it is so this may be the case
of these there were fourteen dollars a
piece
I believe there's like this code online
yes for 50% off your total purchase
that's not affiliated I just saw it on
the website and I don't even know if
they're gonna be good or not so I'm not
suggesting you buy them I'm just stating
what's the truth okay I don't have on
any lip products obviously so I can test
it out in this video
but without further ado we're gonna go
ahead and jump reading it so do
subscribe to my channel ok let's start
first I really want to try out it showed
people trying them like with a little
brush but the first one I want to try
out is called a unicorn and oh it's like
super gooey
let's get that close-up shot so you guys
can see unicorn it's kind of like arid
essent has that super okay here we go
oh my gosh
it isn't really smell like anything
specifically okay I'm excited to try it
out kind of nervous I'm going to try
this morphe wyatt 20 brush because I've
seen girls try it out online with a
circular brush or like an artiste brush
but I know not everybody has artiste
brushes on hand so I want to
realistically just try this out what's
kind of like a pen
our situation and super air that sinking
I see that it feels thick I say this is
really interesting looking it feels like
a lip gloss but it's not sticky at all
as gooey as it was in the packaging
feels so good on the lips
this brush applied it so well so I don't
think you need that fancy artiste brush
to apply it I think like a pencil brush
or a small fluffy brush works as well I
think it would get a little streaky with
an actual lip brush that's why I kind of
went into using a little more of a
smaller fluffy brush but we definitely
don't feel long wearing whatsoever the
lighter colors are in every lip product
are normally less tricky I got some
darker colors we're going to try out to
see if they're strictly or not but I
think this looks really cool if you're
like going out to a cool restaurant or
bar and like I have black lights like
this would be so aired essent you can
tell a little bit more in person it's a
little more arid essence and I'm looking
in my viewfinder but if my lights are
kind of bright so they kind of dim it a
little bit of the air in essence but I
like it this is a lippy number one now
we're going to move on to the gold color
and then a fun color
they're the darker ones are not so easy
to get even and by the way I was going
to say on the air at us and when we just
tried unicorn I think it would be really
cool on top of a darker lippy would be
so cool but look it's kind of getting
everywhere so I feel like these would be
a lot of maintenance to wear like you
would have to keep checking it out you
definitely don't dry down you have to
use a little bit more of the brighter
colors they're so comfortable on the
lips they are the best way to describe
them I would say is good they just still
like freaking goo and not like that like
they're not sticky that's why I say goo
like they're very gooey but they don't
so sticky like a heavy lip glass from
Mac or like one of those thick lip
glosses it feels thick but just not
sticky it's a very strange texture to it
so it's the best way like saying it to
describe this I would definitely say is
goo like lips blue by the way this color
is called Python comes off so easy and
they don't stain the lip so that's kind
of like a little bonus with them too now
next we're going to try it 24 karat gold
no just 24 karat oh it's an old colored
girl on its side it I know some of these
colors are taking and trying but there's
a lot of normal colors on the site this
one stinks just this isn't picking on it
like this one has a quite a smell to it
whoa so here we have gold I think it's
really pretty on um are you kidding me
story of my life oh come on it's just
like you have to wear a lot of the
darker color so you had to like keep
checking to make sure it's not like
smeared or touch because again they
don't throw it down they're kind of
goopy on your lips and you don't to be
talking to someone and have this
happening so I think maybe working a
little less product on would be the
better option we're going to go ahead
and move on to the next color and I'm
going to try to use less product and see
what happens
whoo my lips I'm gonna try chiffon next
chiffon looks like this as you see it's
gooey across my hand and now this is our
like pretty average normal ish color and
I'm just going to apply this with a
pencil brush chiffon is so pretty and
why was so go too much in and I use a
little less product and I find that it
worked better this is a lighter color so
it went on a little bit more even with
super easy to blend out I probably
wouldn't full with the darker colors
much because it's just hard to get them
even without using a lot of color but
they work best the less amount of
product that you use so it's kind of
tricky to get on the deeper colors but
now the lighter ones are super beautiful
lightweight to where don't feel sticky
mmm and you can put these on top of a
liquid lipstick and honey so beautiful
I'm really excited about these I think
these are great these are really cool
product I'm not mad at it you know now
they're $14.99 each and I think that's
with some money off I don't know if it's
one of the sites that always has like
some money I'll still I don't know this
is gorgeous and unicorn is gorgeous and
I think like the gold color could be
really cool moment if you want it to
like switch it up and do like a fun
goldish look but again it just like the
lighter the color the better these work
and the less park you use the better
they work so I approve these any of you
these are a really innovative
interesting hybrid lip goop
and I think that I would enjoy wearing
this like this color I would enjoy
wearing like on an everyday basis super
easy to match with different looks so
let me know what you think in the
comments down below it is a tiny little
pod that it comes in and it has all the
ingredients on the back case you guys
were wondering and I got this at house
of beauty Co I will obviously link where
I got them down below yeah I guess I
will be honest I get super like homemade
product vibes like not made in a lab I
don't know if that's true or not out of
this just like the stickers and
containers I like homemade vibes from it
but it came in you know nicely tightly
packaged and everything looked great so
and the website shipped well so all that
was a great experience from them I'm
just cleaning my beauty discs won't give
it a review don't mind me that is pretty
much a wrap for this video guys thank
you so much for being here today and
watching I love you guys so much and be
