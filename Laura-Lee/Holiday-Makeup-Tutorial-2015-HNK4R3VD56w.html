video is going to be in this makeup look
right here it is really really pretty
and Ida paired it with a dark lip if you
don't like or are not comfortable with
rocking every time that was actually a
really important phone call and I'm glad
that I answered it but anyways I hope
you guys like this tutorial it is gonna
be a talk through video and I see a lot
of comments on my past Emeka toriel's
cuz I did a quick voice over and I mean
it's a 50/50 thing I think 50% of people
like the quick get to the point videos
and then there's 50% of the people out
there who like the slow talk through
break it down have a chitchat moment so
just know I see your comments I'm trying
to do both in my videos I'm not just
like gonna do all click voiceovers but
some are gonna be and some are going to
be longer talkers like this video right
here bear with me I see you I'm trying
to please everybody with switching it up
so here we have our longer top 3 videos
I hope you enjoyed the video please give
it a thumbs up we are going to go vampa
fire self right now we all just take a
moment to appreciate my sideburns
already have my eyebrows applied and
I'll have that video linked down below
if you want to see how I do my eyebrows
and they're gonna go in with a little
bit of the next angel bill primer I'm
gonna apply that all over my face
this one is oil-free and skin perfecting
so it's kind of like a two-in-one primer
doing a lot of work for you
so going with a little bit of Smashbox
to you Skin Foundation and 2.5 and an
ankle kabuki from Sigma this is the f88
the famous f88 that you've seen
everybody on YouTube used before now
we're going to be using the vice palette
from Urban Decay this is like the Vice I
don't know it's like the four or five is
it seven and out remember like what
number this is but we're gonna be going
in if you don't have this palette I
think you can totally still create this
look just be creative and use what other
codes you have on hand first I'm just
going to go in with this cream color
called framed and this is just gonna
smooth out the primer make everything
easy to blend out so just all over I'm
using the e-40 blending brush from Sigma
now go with the e25 brush from sigma and
pick up a little bit of bitten which is
this one tone Parmalee color of the
color on one side of the brush I'm going
to flip the brush upside down I'm going
to blend this into the upper crease area
like that all the way from the inner to
the outer focusing most of the color on
that outer corner right here I'm gonna
grab a little bit of delete which is
just a matte dark brown color with the
same 825 brush I'm just gonna look at a
little bit of the color right on the tip
of the brush I'm going to pop that in
the outer corner and blend it out
I'm gonna take a little bit of that
shade on the tip of the same brush I'm
gonna pop it in the inner corner and I'm
just gonna very softly blend it out
notice I'm taking just a little bit of
color and building it up instead of
going in with a fully loaded brush
because I don't want to like I have a
black eye trying to avoid that but again
I'm just trying to focus it on the inner
and outer corner and then I'm just gonna
go softly and blend it in the crease
alright I'm talking about counts because
I am an animal whisperer this looks a
little bit crazy right now but don't
worry we're gonna clean that up just to
deepen up a little bit more I'm gonna go
with deadbeat which is like this matte
black color but it has like the tiniest
bit of sparkle with it if you have just
a plain matte black eye shadow I think
it would work just as well gonna go over
the crease cuz I just feel like for some
reason it needs to be a little bit
darker by the way I wing all my makeups
oils I do not plan any of them out I
just kind of do them so bear with me now
I'm going to wipe off some of this
excess eyeshadows it's like come out way
to further clean that up a bit
I'm gonna grab a little bit of this
shade robbery which is a silvery color
and I'm going to dampen the color with
the mac fix+ spray I'm using a flat
definer brush anything obviously any
synthetic brush that you have on hand
will work great for this part what I'm
going to do is take the color and apply
it right to the center of the lid
you can leave the look just like this if
you want to I think we turn out I was
literally gorgeous pop on some lashes or
some mascara but what I'm gonna do is
enhance it just a little bit with stud
this is the new Kevin Klein NARS
eyeshadow and it is so gorgeous it's a
silvery color but it has a little bit
more sparkle to it so I really just want
to add that on top to enhance the color
more like I said this part is so not
mandatory it doesn't make the look so
you could stop where I was at but I just
have to go the extra mile always now I'm
just gonna take a little bit more of
that Browns elite shade the dark brown
and I'm just gonna blend it just to
soften up the edges that way there's no
harsh craziness going on add a little
bit more deadbeet to that outer corner
just to deepen it up and I love the way
it looks dark I'm all about it but like
I said you can stop where we were at or
you can keep going make the tutorial
your own do you do what you want to do
take a little bit of bones which is this
light creamy shade and I'm just gonna
apply it to the brow bone
add a little bit of the NARS audacious
mascara who knows we skip wing liner on
this look I feel like I've been doing so
many looks with dramatic liner that it
was time to do something a little bit
different so we're gonna leave that off
and just do false lashes I'm gonna be
adding the Akito lashes
it was hard the big city at night so I
think these are newer lashes from them
and holy Toledo beautiful we're gonna
work on the face a little bit and I'll
come back to finish the eyes I'm gonna
go in with a little bit of my Maybelline
better skin it comes in there and I'm
going to just kind of highlight the face
apply it in my usual areas and I'm going
to blend that out with an f-86
that is done I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of my Laura Mercier
translucent powder I'm going to set the
concealer that way it doesn't crease
it's gonna last longer it's gonna be
happy all the lids long day now that
that is excuse me I'm going to go in
with a little bit hoola bronzer from
benefit I'm gonna be using the new a
sigma contour chisel in trim contour
brush this is an SS 77 it comes out on
Monday I am ecstatic about these brushes
only gonna chisel some cheeks yes honey
we're done anyways I'm just gonna work
this back and forth and blend it out and
then blend it up just a little bit I'm
gonna do a little bit on the temples per
usual and drag it into my hairline as
well as along the forehead do a little
bit down the nose
then I take that ad 57 which is another
one their new brushes I'm gonna dip it
into a little bit of the loose well I'm
gonna dip it into a little bit of that
Laura Mercier translucent powder and I'm
gonna cut that contour and make it
really sharp and pretty and perfect
we're on the chin too so we'll let that
sit there for a minute while we do our
blush in our highlight but I'm gonna go
in with this morphe 9b palette I'm gonna
go in with the center color these are so
pigmented you have to be careful with
these blushes if you have this palette
like you literally have to tap tap and
then apply you know I seriously look
crazy I'm gonna go in with this Bobby
Brown highlight and bronze glow so
gorgeous another brush from Sigma from
their little collection is the high
cheekbone highlighter the so3 our
cheekbone area I'm gonna bring it around
the temples like just whatever is left
on the brush now I'm gonna go in with
this lovely a super soft brush this is
the F 23 I'm gonna desktop all the
excess translucent powder
yes there are Oh yo-yo finished the
bottom half of our eyes so I go in with
a little bit of biter which remember was
our warmer brown color I'm gonna use an
e at 57 and I'm just gonna go I sure
hope you guys can't hear my stomach
growling so the bottom matches the top
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
delete on the tip of this brush and just
blend it to smoke it out a little bit
now I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
this NARS black kohl liner and must fill
in the waterline as well as this inner
corner where my fault / and like my
eyelid starts and there's like a gap of
darkness I'm just gonna go in the inner
corner and we'll do a little top lining
while we're at it always look so freaky
Bossa mascara okay cool
I'm gonna line my lips with a little bit
of night moth by Mac just to stay in the
light and this is Reese's and new liquid
lipsticks with lip flan
tell them one front finger on the pump
make the sixth straight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
