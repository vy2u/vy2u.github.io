video is going to be this gorgeous
golden smokey eye with a pair of the
nude lip I love how it looks super
metallic right there in the corner and
then it's like smokey on out we did do a
full face look in this tutorial
including the highlight mm-hmm don't let
it blind you I am of course very excited
for you to see it I partnered with Ulta
to create this look so therefore all the
products that you see this video are
sold at Ulta or uLTA Beauty calm I will
have them all linked down below be sure
to check them out I cannot wait for you
guys to see this look I had so much fun
creating it as I do all my fake it looks
yeah I think that's all I got for you so
I hope you guys enjoy be sure to give it
a thumbs up indeed and let's jump right
in and get started to start this
tutorial off I'm gonna be going in with
my honest Tashia dip brow pomade in dark
brown I'm gonna be filling in my brows I
have the full eyebrows tutorial linked
down below if you want to check that out
next I will go in with a little bit of
the Urban Decay eyeshadow potion I'm
gonna put I don't know why I did that
evil laugh anyways I'm gonna put a
little bit of this to my eyelids and
blend it out with my finger then I'm
going with this gorgeous Christmas or
like holiday palette from Too Faced this
is sold only at Ulta and I'm gonna go in
with reindeer which is a really neutral
subtle color i blend this right into the
crease but once I build it up you really
couldn't tell that how much of a color
on my eyelid I like to use a nice soft
color like this to begin with because it
evens out and blends out and lightens up
that eye primer then I will go in with a
little bit more of a deeper mauve color
called dreams I'm gonna pop that right
on top of reindeer in the crease and I'm
just gonna pull in it this is gonna be
our transition shade and help the other
colors to blend out seamlessly so like I
say the same thing a majority of my
tutorials but not everybody sees all my
tutorials anyways I'm just gonna blend
that all throughout the crease next I
will mix together after hours and
honeypot first I'm gonna go in with
After Hours I'm gonna pack this onto the
lid with a shader
brush notice I'm not blending the color
I'm simply it popping it onto the lid
because I'm on my eyelid up a play I
want a little bit of a golden look to
this so I popped honeypot right on top
of the after-hours I love the titles of
the eyeshadows I think they are so cute
then I'm gonna go in with a little bit
of knockout which is a chocolatey brown
color I'm gonna pop that in the outer
corner more so rather than the crease
I'm gonna be blending this out notice
I'm not taking the color too far and I'm
trying to be careful just to make it
gradient in that corner instead of
covering up a lot of the gold because I
just want this to smoke out that outer
corner of course doing the same thing to
the other eye then I'll go in with
secret lover secret lover oh I'm gonna
pop this right on top a knockout and
then I'm just gonna blend it in a little
bit more the only reason I'm going in
with secret lover is because I didn't
feel like it looked dark enough and I
want it to be smoky smoky so I'm just
gonna really light handedly softly blend
that out just make it small little Pat's
and small little strokes to blend it out
then I'll go in with a clean blender and
I'm going to soften up the edges make
sure there are no harshness going on
next up I'm gonna go in with paper roses
which is a light rosy shimmery shade and
I'm going to pop that on to the brow
bone to tie the look together and to
really give our brow bone that nice lift
then I'll go in with chocolate moon just
because of course I was just like it is
not deep enough in the outer corner it
needs to be darker so I went in with the
darkest shade and I'm just gonna gently
pack that right on top of secret lovers
just building it up then I will go in
with this lamb come eyeliner to Wang it
out I'm gonna go ahead and line the
upper lash line and then draw a small
line straight out to create our wing and
then I will come back in with that I
need to do an updated winged eyeliner
tutorial coming soon to a theatre
then I'll go in and curl my lashes I'm
gonna be adding false lashes but if you
want to do that you can simply build up
your lashes with your favorite mascara
and they will be on poly but as for me
I'm not gonna do that because my lashes
are pitiful but I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of the toothpaste it's better
than sex mascara which actually came
with this palette and I'm gonna pop that
on that way my lashes blend with the
falsies or somewhat blend the issue in
my lashes is that they grow straight out
instead of curl up so it they just irks
me I'm gonna be going in with the
biggest nay and I'll or lashes in
shining star which are my favorite by
eyelure they're so pretty and then pop
these on and these came with the glue
then I'm gonna go in with the NYX shine
killer primer I'm gonna pop this all
over my face
this really smooths out the skin and
gives it a nice even tone for your
foundation to set on top of your
foundation today I will be using the
Smashbox Studios skin foundation in 2.5
I have been using this foundation as my
everyday foundation lately and I have
just been loving the way it sets on the
skin just for a good not too heavy
coverage not too light coverage but
medium coverage foundation for everyday
use it's just kind of been my go-to
lately and it's been working for me now
we're gonna hide any dark circles or
unwanted area as well as highlight our
face with the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and medium light I'm gonna do
the under eyes down the nose the
forehead the Cupid's bow and the chin
these are areas that I want to be pushed
out and to be noticed more but yet also
I want them to have some coverage so I'm
gonna blend that out in those areas in a
patting motion and then I will swipe
away the excess of course I'm gonna set
this with the Anasazi Beverly Hills
contour palette I'm using the shade
banana to set everywhere I put the
concealer this is gonna help it not to
crease and just to last longer I love
this yellow tone shade for my skin tone
then I will go in with Jabba and I will
contour my face I'm just gonna blend
this out with this little this is not a
little brush this is a big brush by
Tarte so it's hard to get really precise
with this brush but it is really soft on
the skin so I did enjoy using it but if
want a really precise contour I don't
think this is the brush to create that
with so I'm just gonna blend Java around
the area's really bronzing up my face
rather than like strictly contouring my
face just because that brush then I'm
gonna go in with the makeup revolution
blush this is a pretty peachy pink shade
and I love it in this brushes blush this
blush is super affordable next I will go
in with the mood stone highlighter and
this is such a pretty light shade I'm
gonna pop that onto the upper cheekbone
to keep its bow down the nose and just a
dash of it onto my temples that way my
skin looks a little bit luminous then I
will go in with dreams and I will blend
that all the way from the inner to the
outer corner on the lower lash line next
I will go in with knockout which was the
darker brown color and just pop it on
the outer corners of the lower lash line
and of course we're gonna add some
mascara to our lower lashes as for lips
go I'm gonna be using the NYX lip liner
in nude pink which is a great neutral
lip liner from NYX and I'm just gonna
blend that pretty much all over my lips
and right on top of that I'm gonna go in
with this essence lipstick in number two
which is a pretty pretty nude color and
again this one is super affordable and
pop that onto the lips for a neutral lip
and of course we have to set everything
with the Urban Decay setting spray and
we are finished thank you guys so much
for watching if you liked it please give
this video a thumbs up and I hope to see
you all in my next video bye
