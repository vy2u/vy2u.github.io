today today's video is going to be kind
of like a try it out does it work what
the hell is the situation we're gonna be
trying out some products from milk
beauty these are the first products I've
ever owned from milk beauty I got I'm at
Sephora the holographic highlight which
is the main product run to try out and
then I bought another highlighter in the
same form it's not nearly as cool but I
figure we tried out my other cheek and I
just got some other junk I thought I
would share with you just since I bought
it
these are twenty four dollars each a
seems really cool so we're going to be
testing them out we'll see what happens
also if you want to watch on my eyes
right now it is a floral available
palette which is for sale right now if I
sold out it is gone forever this is a
limited edition palette if you're
wondering what I have on my eyes today I
have on smash lay on my lid you get 20
eyeshadow shades have her matte half are
shimmery some are like duochrome
is really awesome I'll have everything
leaked down below shameless plug I got
her a booger oh don't know you've never
had a booger first we will review the
coolest thing ever or I hope it's gonna
be the coolest thing ever this is the
milk makeup this is called supernova and
it's a holographic stick it is meant to
be a lavender hump
I had a clear cover on it it's meant to
be a lavender holographic highlighter
what does that even mean I don't know a
highlighter stick that gives a hyper
lavender Araneta effect foreign at
other-worldly
aurora provides a prism attic glow for
an out-of-this-world whatever a lot of
people are saying they like this product
and a lot of people are saying they try
it from their cheekbone on from their
fingertips on to their cheek I want to
color on my face with it and see what
happens it comes in this little
container right here and you just scroll
up it looks like you get a lot of
product I don't know if I could ever see
myself using that much holographic
highlighter I don't know I might cut out
my whole face with it we'll see depends
on how cool it is what if I mess up I
make it
oh my boy I definitely should have went
fingertips to face and the texture of it
is really thick whenever you apply it
the way I applied it blending out pretty
well but it's making my other makeup
look a little bit patchy just because
the way I went in with it but oh it's
pretty ok let's add more purple do you
see like the hint on lavender anybody
yet I mean that may seem scary but same
time it's so pretty look at that this is
a really cool product and I I like it I
wouldn't apply it again the way I
applied it I would more so do the
dabbing fingers to face mode but it's
really pretty it feels sticky on the
skin so it doesn't turn into like a
cream to powder kind of situation it's
mostly just a cream but it's definitely
something different I think it would
complement lighter skin than mine even
better I don't think it looks bad on my
skin but I think it would complement a
lighter skin tone even better because if
you can see it's super like white like
so now let's put a flash on it and take
a picture with it and just see like what
it looks like in pictures or the flash
on here I go doesn't look any craziness
I'm gonna take a picture with flash and
it almost just looks white in the
picture which is a little bit
disappointing because I wanted it to
look
holographic so it's not as cool as I
wanted it to be the swatch of it which I
have a crapload of it on my finger
whenever I swatch it is hella
holographic look at that you guys think
comment down below if you think it's
worth $24 it is a really cool concept on
this cheap just because I have it this
is called lit this is another more
down-to-earth wearable highlight I guess
you could call it no no it kind of runs
me a smidge of opal by Becca cosmetics
Oh
it has exact same texture and feel to it
as did the holographic lavender oh I'm
going to apply this one with just my
finger I feel like you're outside the
other one with just my finger we
wouldn't have gotten much of the
holographic fill at all I feel like I
had to go in pretty deep with it but to
make it extremely wearable definitely
apply it with your finger for the video
sake I wanted to apply it just rubbing
it on my skin so we get a lot of product
that way we could actually tell what
it's going to look like but this is just
a pretty simple subtle highlight and
it's really grazie which I don't like
that the greasy texture to because it's
like really sticky like in here going on
my skin so they are a little bit heavy
filling versus like a light cream to
power powder highlight just a little bit
about the brand if you want to know it
is a sulfate free paraben free this is a
free vegan cruelty free makeup brand
says you can just use it on your skin
you know you die you know you die ah
it's even oh it's the most cool on the
skin like do you see my cheek kind of
looks like that but that's so dope on
the skin if you're going to a festival
or if you're just going out to the club
with your girlfriends and you wanted a
little extra cool glow in the light
that's that's just dope right there I
love it more so for the body come on
body it has like a crayon waxy kind of
smell nothing special going on there
almost better for the body than for the
face about two more of these things I
just thought it would be cool to mention
them to you guys this one is the cooling
one so it's actually pretty neat I've
already tried it out it is just a
cooling stick for like the under the
eyes the bag and the stick is pretty
much always cold and it just goes on
clear like that and you rub it in it
feels so good it's not greasy or heavy
or anything like that it's actually
quite lightweight and it just feels so
good all over the skin it just helps to
deep up the face another one I haven't
tried yet is a hydrating one this is
like a hydrating all and
oh it still got the cover on it go you
stupid oh it's so crazy and groans I
don't know if I could put this on my
face y'all oh it's like a it's like a
stick of Greece which granite if you're
like into those putting oils on your
face you mic like this I'm not living
for it it's just like a stick of grease
like this if you if you're having
breakouts or acne oh it feels like a dry
hole kind of like an Argand royal you
haven't breakouts or acne I don't
recommend this one to you it's just a
very um it's the stick it's a stick of
grease I mean could you fryer chicken
with it I don't know maybe that is my
review of the holographic supernova
highlight I think it's absolutely
amazing for the body I think it's really
cool in the face I think it would
complement lighter skin tones the most
but I think everybody could wear it and
it is a really neat unique product is
heavy on the skin and a little bit
patchy and it doesn't show up to
supernova II in picture so if you're
looking for that cool Instagram picture
with a supernova hey I don't know that
it's going to do that for you overall I
do like the product and I'm really glad
I got to review for you guys hope you
guys enjoyed this review and like my
review of all the other sticks from milk
beauty that I picked up if you did then
subscribe to my channel and I hope to
see you guys in my next video I love you
