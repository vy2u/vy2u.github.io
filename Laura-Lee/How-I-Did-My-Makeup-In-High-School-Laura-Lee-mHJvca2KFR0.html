might have like a little list but I feel
like we can work through it cuz apps
start wearing them more um good for here
oh okay hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be how I did
my makeup in high school and you're
looking at it this is how I wore it this
is how I wore my hair in high school
just so you know I'm also wearing one of
my high school t-shirts right now this
is actually Tyler's high school t-shirt
I don't have any high school t-shirt yes
me and my husband met in high school
also in this video I tell you my
interesting high school experience also
I had this many gray hairs and that not
this many but I have a lot of gray hairs
in high school and my hair was all dark
I'll put some pictures around so you can
get a good visual I know you want to see
it Bart genki genki was my name I'll sit
who's ringing the doorbell up team don't
be stingy with him the subscribe button
you know show me a little love I feel
like the only way to start out this
video right is to put up my hair like I
wore it in high school I either put it
in a ponytail like this had a lot of
this going on in the ponytail normally
and so then I would pull it tight and
then for whatever reason I would pull
the ponytail from the back and let it
lop over like that this is this is one
of the ways I would always wear my hair
in high school high school was an
interesting time for me and I wouldn't
go back high school I always wore makeup
every day there wasn't really a time
that I didn't wear makeup but it wasn't
like a lot of makeup and I wore a lot of
Mac makeup and of course drugstore
makeup first in high school I don't even
think facial primers existed I'm talking
about the year 2008 which was the year I
graduated I did wear Mac Studio Fix
foundation and I remember I only used a
very small amount of product because I
knew I could never afford to repurchase
it so like I would basically let a
bottle like this last me my whole entire
school year good for
you Laura I'm pretty sure I was the
wrong shade as well I would dot it on my
face I'm trying to remember guys sweetie
long time ago it was a dotting method
and then with my hands I would rub it in
every morning I didn't have acne in high
school I was very fortunate it was
hereditary my mom and dad had good skin
so me my brother and sister had good
thick skin and I think it was just
hereditary because I went to bed every
single night with my full makeup on and
we just wash it off in the morning when
I took a shower every night oh thanks
mom and dad for that versus girl my
school who had really like velvety
smooth skin like she didn't have a
freckle on her skin so her skin was just
like all one shade it's like perfect
no acne either and she always asked her
I was like what are you wearing she was
I I wear foundation powder and I saw her
applying at lunch one day and I was like
so I went and got it and I remember at
the time it was covergirl in like a long
blue packaging which doesn't exist
anymore so I'm just gonna use a
drugstore one and long packaging I don't
know this is the closest thing I can get
to it and I always use a sponge that
came in it so I'm I use a sponge and I
would just like apply it right on top of
the foundation the matte guy was like
his name was Matthew and he worked in
Montgomery Alabama which is where I'm
from
hey my gum right and he was like I don't
think you should wear the foundation
powder on top of your foundation and it
changed my life I quit doing it I'm
beyond to the back in 2008 eyebrows went
on everything and my eyebrows were like
three hairs like it was like a straight
line there was no like even a curve and
it was just like straight across mine
did I do that for I shadow I didn't have
a I shadow primer nor facial primer
primers were just not it for me and I
had two Mac eyeshadows that I wore only
two and what's embarrassing is I still
have those two eyeshadows I don't use
them anymore but I still have them
they're like a collection piece so here
they are they're from Mac this is orb
and this is cork for the actual ones
from high school this is
Mack pal what was I thinking mind you my
senior year of high school I worked at a
pet store as a cashier I had a brush I
don't remember what brush I had but I'm
just going to take a brush I think was
similar and I would just take some form
no eyeshadow primer just and I would put
it in the upper part of my I worked at a
pet store and I remember my mom got me
the job because I needed money because I
didn't have a car and I was trying to
like get a car and there was a lot going
on man I remember it was our senior trip
and like we were all going to Panama
City Beach I think was a Spring Break
hmm for a lot of kids from my high
school that hung out together and they
worked at the pet store and I didn't
really hang out with them much and they
all asked off work together for their
senior trip knowing that I would be left
in the dust and would have to work what
does flora do she doesn't even mention
it to her boss because she already knows
that they're gonna tell her no she can't
have a work and when it came time person
your trip she goes doesn't call and work
and just quiz by not showing up yes
don't ever do that so it's terrible with
me and I can't believe I had the balls
to do something that ratchet I would
take orb with the finger and I would
just apply orb to the lid or it's like
pretty much invisible so I don't know
why this was such thing for me next up I
wore eyeliner day in day out no matter
what eyeliner was like my thing and it
still is today so I always wore matte
black track eyeliner which at the time
gel liners were not popping every brand
didn't have a gel liner Mac had black
track liner it looked just like this
this is one of their fluid lines this is
in wave line so it's blue but I want it
to give you guys a visual but exactly
what I was using I'm gonna use this one
by went and Wow because it's very
similar but I would wear the Mac one
every single day I had a little eMac
eyeliner brush brush was identical to
this this is exactly what my brush look
like so I'm going to use this this is
actually a sigma eo5 brush
just like that
that was my eyeliner I always made sure
to have it way thicker on the outer
corner and then go in thinner because I
thought it like widen and open my eyes
and then we're not quite done yet I
would also go ahead and line the bottom
part I would built in my waterline with
the brush and then I would take it on
the bottom and go half way
so that was my eyeliner this is looking
very familiar to high school and then I
did the colossal I think it was like it
was by Maybelline it was in a purple um
to mascara but I don't have it and I
looked and they dont sell it anymore I'm
just gonna use this push-up Falls these
by Maybelline but it was a Maybelline
mascara back then was really popular all
the girls had it and makeup bag
I did also wear bronzer in high school I
don't for the life of me remember what
bronzer was I'm sure was it drugstore
bronzer so I'm gonna grab this bronzer
from L'Oreal called glam bronze I've
racked my brain I cannot think of the
bronzer but I specifically remember
exactly how I wore the bronzer I'd put
the bronzer on my cheeks like blush and
then always on the front of the nose
like a lot of bronzer on the front of
the nose that was a crucial thing all
over the forehead I mean really it was
just like another layer of powder to me
never wore any lip product other than
chapstick like there was no lip product
for me so this is exactly my makeup in
high school I remember messing your
pictures my mom let me borrow her Mary
Kay eyeshadow so it was a little more
glamorous but the eyeliners and lashes
look just like this I had had it with
school by the time I got to high school
because I've done bad in school my whole
entire life I was held back in
kindergarten because I wasn't doing well
mom put me in a private school fifth
grade and you had to take tests to get
into the private school and I tested so
low getting into the private school that
the school was like she should be if she
goes to school she needs to go to fifth
grade again because her tests are so low
mom was like okay
so that left me graduating high school
at the age of 19 because I had already
been held back in kindergarten which
would have made me graduate at 18 and
would make me kind of normal with
everybody else hard because like as a
kid you don't have a choice and I guess
I'm glad I didn't have a choice because
I mean I got through it so it's fine but
it it just sucks because society tells
you schools for everybody right school
was hard for me in elementary school it
was even harder for me my mom put me in
a private school because those schools
they're a lot harder I struggled and my
mom would sit there with me and study
and study and study and it didn't matter
ever I came time for high school I
begged my mom to get me the hell up out
of the private school let me go and she
was like yes you can go back to public
school so I was like deuces so I went to
public school and
and I was old one year older my grade
but it was whatever so I took a
psychology class and it talked about
people that were a DD or dyslexic and
they described me to a tee and it made
me realize that really allowed me to
accept why I was doing bad in school and
it realized that made me realize that
was more than just an idiot like I
wasn't just a stupid kid like that I
thought differently than people and
that's why I did not do good in school
that psychology class definitely changed
my life it changed my thought process it
really didn't give a about my
grades for the rest of the time in high
school which actually was I mean not a
good thing but it was just like the more
that I studied the worse my grades were
had a lot of fun in high school of my
friends but as far as like the grade
part of it and school part of it
it really sucks for me and left me
feeling unconfident about myself that I
feel like a stupid individual I think
overall in high school just me caring
about my grades made me feel inside more
stupid and less confident because I
would do so bad either way on my tests
and on my grades I'm a homework than
whatever so me not caring about my
grades and skipping school and doing all
that let me have the excuse that maybe I
was doing bad because I skipped school
not because I really don't get it
yeah high school was a trying time for
me I got nothing I got in trouble
because I was sneaky but I would go out
and drink with my friends and skip
school as much as I could because I had
if I made good grades or school kind of
came to me a little easier I think that
I wouldn't have skipped school as much
or focused on partying with my friends
which I shouldn't have done but I just
chucked it up as a loss and end up
graduating when like a 2.5 GPA like I
graduated by a hair on a horse's ass
like barely all my friends went off to
college and I was like well society now
tells us we have to go to college so I
have to go to college and of course I
applied to go to college like everybody
else and I don't get in in he college
here I was unemployed because I had quit
my job to go on a stupid senior trip and
I couldn't get into college and my life
depended on it and um I felt like a
total failure again in life like as soon
as high school got out
I always lost I learned very quickly at
that point that colleges stop looking at
your high school GPA whenever you turn
21 so whenever I turned 21 I applied to
get into a night school because I found
a job at Dick's Sporting Goods and I was
unloading boxes from an 18-wheeler at
night got into night school and then at
that time as well some of the fellow
girls from my high school worked at a
dermatologists office and they got me a
job as a medical assistant where they
trained me there and I stayed there for
four years while in college now the only
reason I went to college was because
that's what all my friends did that's
what society's tells you you're supposed
to do after high school so that's what I
thought to be a good person to have a
good life that's what I had to do and
all I did was rack up a lot of college
debt and I end up flunking out of
college had a really good job though the
dermatology is honestly could've worked
there for the rest of my life and paid
my rent for my little apartment and paid
for my little Honda and been a happy
girl but life was calling more for me
and I started a YouTube channel so I
didn't start the channel really as for
my career I just started it
for an outlet because all's I did was
work and I was young and I kind of felt
like I was at a loss you know like what
am i doing in the world so I'm getting
teary eyed where I will tell you in high
school I was really good at art I was
art art art art art I had a an art I
went on all the art field trips as a
creative outlet it wasn't studying it
was just creativity and I loved I
remember on the last day of high school
I had a really hard math teacher mr.
Smith and he called me up to his desk
and I was like this is where he tells me
he's gonna fill me a hmm I'm gonna be in
high school til I'm 23 he didn't tell me
if I pass or fail but he said tell me
whenever you go on the world to exceed
in the things that you're good at or
your strong points in life and just
leave the rest behind you that has
literally stuck with me my whole entire
life and I sat down my desk and of
course I was just like oh my god so does
that mean like
he's passing man this man told me that
you know I'm not my wife it's not a
total loss and I'm not an idiot just
because I'm not yet as cool just know if
you're a teacher out there you have the
opportunity to completely change a kid's
life by small things you can tell them
even your worst student who makes all s
keep encouraging them you know as want
to leave this message with you you're
doing that in high school don't just
chalk it up as well I'm just bad at
school so s it definitely don't chalk it
up as that try your hardest because hard
work never goes unnoticed and move on
with your life you know do great things
Excel what you're good at and then leave
the rest behind you you know I was good
at creativity and art and I let that
path you know carry me through life so
here I am because of it I know this
video was a little bit like sad and
emotional but I really wanted to tell my
experience in high school you know it
was a hot mess I skipped school I drank
I filled and I was all over the place um
don't let your past make you think that
you can't do anything with your future I
love you guys thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoy the way my
hair and makeup looked in high school
