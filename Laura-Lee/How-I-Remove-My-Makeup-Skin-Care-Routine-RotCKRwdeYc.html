my channel today's video is going to be
a much requested one because I posted
this picture on my gram and a lot of you
guys asked me to show you - my skincare
routine as well as how I remove my
makeup because I'm possibly show you
guys how I pack on all the cake I love
the cake I pack on the cake I'm going to
show you God take it off why just do
like guns I don't know what's happening
getting very aggressive in this video
very quickly
but now I'm going to show you how I take
off the cake as well as my skincare
routine because it is truly been working
with for me so well my skin has just not
giving me any issues thank you so much
please please say this way I was like do
I have any announcements for them but
this is skincare like let's keep it low
maintenance in this video okay we're
going to jump right in and get started
hope you guys enjoy let's go do the skin
care all right let's get into removing
some makeup so there's a cat til in my
way there's always a cat tail in my way
and the first thing I like to do is
squeeze my fur baby because I love him
so much and then I do the thing that
feels best remove those daggum lashes
yes gotta rip them off hmm I can see
again then I like to take my pixie
moisturizing cleansing loss which you
can use any wet wipe and yes I do need
to get my nails redone we're gonna
pretend they don't look that gross and I
like to remove any lipstick liquid
lipstick lip liner whatever
I've been wearing I like I've been
eating a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich but I like to go ahead and take
that off first
then I'll go in with the garni err micro
cell mica cells
ginseng water it's cleansing water it's
alcohol free and it's Bowl free it's
just awesome so I like to remove the
brows my brows are growing out and I'm
quite proud of them
what I actually like to use to cleanse
my face with is the Clarisonic me if it
is a lightweight compact cleanser that
cleanser way all the makeup all the
impurities and what I like to use with
is the Tarte rainforest of the sea deep
dive cleansing gel you just need one
little drop mm you like that sound
effect that was annoying I like to dip
in my face and then I will start with my
cleanser I just
it around with a light handed motion it
cleans six times better than your hands
it cleans away absolutely everything it
has two settings a gentle one and a more
powerful one I like to use the more
gentle one and then I will wash
everything away it's so easy and my face
is super clean and then I will Pat my
face dry with a towel as far as skincare
I like to go in with my belief aqua balm
this is a gel hydrant for your skin and
it's not going to clog reports because
gels are water-based more cream
moisturizers or old base I have dry skin
and this does plenty for me as far as
moisturizing my skin I've been using
this stuff for a long long time
next is for serum so I've been using the
Murad advanced active radiance serum
that these things have steps to them but
I just use this one because we break in
all types of roles and just massage this
all around my skin it repairs your skin
it protects it from the horrible
environment out there
it gets crazy other people be careful
then for the under eye areas I like to
use its potent by benefit this is a nice
eye cream I use this every other night
that way I don't get too much moisture
under my eyes but it does help to make
your makeup look beautiful and your
concealer not crease if you have nice
moisturize under eyes so this is a great
product for that next for any acne
treatment I use the daily repair
treatment all from Shu a it has acne
treatment in it I put two drops in my
hands and just push it into my skin and
it's so good some good and then I will
take the rest and rub it through my hair
isn't all you know make that hair
healthy yes girl and that's pretty much
it I hope you guys enjoy the video you
know leave me a comment if you did and
I'll see you my next video bye guys
