quite a few of them in store that I like
to do to my hair because I hate to say
it ladies but I'm a little bit lazy with

hairdryer and I really like it this
one's my Rusk and of course I'm gonna be
using some product in this video that I
got the site one of my favorite products
that I got from there is the Kenya kenra
not Kenya Kenya is a place in Africa
kenra volume spray oh my goodness I love
this stuff the other product that I'm
literally just like it's the joy Co joy
miss medium so this is their styling and
finishing spray so basically what I love
so so so much about this is like
whenever I finish my messy buns I just
give my spritz with this to lock that
sucker in you do go on the side I got
two big cans of this for a really good
deal and the other ones in my cabinet
bathroom so check it out I shave my
armpits for this video because I had to
lift my arm so many times doing my hair
tutorials and I didn't want you guys to
see the hair oh they're gonna jump right
in and I'm going to show you guys how to
whip up some messy buns in your fro
starting out with messy bun number one
first you need a dance around like a
crazy person and then you'll need a
rubber band some bobby pins and some
volume spray
first I'm gonna spritz a little bit of
the kenra volume spray to add texture
throughout my hair this is gonna help
make the messy bun even Messier then I'm
going to pull my hair up to the top of
my head I'm gonna run my fingers through
it just to smooth out a couple of the
bumps but not all of them because
remember this is the messy bun then I'm
gonna bring my hair and cut it into a
half ponytail cap there should be a loop
because it's only a half pony then I'm
gonna cut that in half again so it's
like you have two separate buns on your
head and it should look something like
this then you're gonna go to the back
bun and you're gonna pull from the back
and you're just gonna pull up it's gonna
tighten it to your head and loosen it up
on top then this is where your bobby
pins are gonna come in you're going to
twist the hair around and connect them
you're gonna connect the two buns on the
side and pop a bobby pin in connecting
the hairs you do it really messy and
just pop a bobby pin in if you have any
hairs hanging out the side eye then wrap
them either around the rubber band to
cover the rubber band in the center
which you can't see from straight on
or I just wrap it around the bun
whatever I'm feeling that day and voila
oh and I almost forgot you have to pull
out all the little stringy hair zor-el
to just look to sleep to your head so
yeah baby here I'll sleep
this step is optional I didn't stick the
end of a teasing comb in and just poops
the front this just gives an appearance
of even a little bit Messier and there
you have messy bun oh yeah girl messy
bun number twos alright this one's not
actually that messy so you're gonna need
an elastic some finishing spray a
bristly brush and bobby pins we're gonna
do the same thing by listing our hair up
on top of our head except for this time
we're gonna smooth it out a little again
this is optional depending on how messy
you want it to be I like this one to be
just a little bit more smooth then I tie
up a really high tight ponytail on top
of my head make sure the ponytail isn't
slouching south to you or else it's
gonna fall down the back of your head
then I'm going to simply twist the hair
as I'm twisting the hair I'm going to
wrap it around and you want to be sure
to tuck the end piece under the bun not
on top or around the bun but under the
bun and you are move on then you're
gonna secure it with a couple of bobby
pins and most importantly don't forget
to spray it with a little bit of setting
spray I'm using my Joyce Pooh setting
spray and what this gonna do is walk
through that little momma in spray a
little here a little there a little
everywhere and voila there is kinda
messy bun number two it's a quick hairdo
now we're moving on to number three
you'll need two elastics a bristly brush
bobby pins and then we're gonna go back
to that kendra volume spray now this
time I'm really gonna work very hard on
smoothing out the hair of course you're
gonna pull it up on top of your head
make sure it ends up it on a pony
setting on top of your head that way it
isn't soft backwards and I'm going to
start spraying the volume spray which
works really well as like a sleek inning
spray and I'm gonna use the bristly part
of the brush I'm gonna really sleek my
hair down to my head and making sure
everything's really tight really soft
and really sleek I guess this one isn't
really a messy bun but
you know it's a bun
and it's quick so again do it the
ponytail and tighten it and then split
your hair and do whatever braids you
want to do I'm just gonna do a regular
braid and I'm gonna secure it with a
little elastic actually secure it with
two elastics that way doesn't go
anywhere cuz my hair gets a little crazy
and I has a mind of its own
so then I'm going to pull apart the
braid as much as I can to make it really
fat and then I'm gonna do something
weird with it and then I'm going to very
gently wrap the braid around my head you
don't want to wrap this spread around
your hair too tight because it's gonna
make it really tall and weird and you're
gonna tuck that in piece underneath and
then you'll secure it with the bobby
pins oh and then I ended up going it
with this a little bit of the volume
spray and I spritz the hair to lock it
in and I also spritz those baby hairs
hanging off my neck there yeah we had a
tight dose up a little bit and we have a
very nice sleek bun that took us like
literally two minutes to create so
amazing hope you guys enjoyed this video
I love you guys and I'll see you all in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
