video is definitely going to be a
different video today I'm going to be
showing you how to contour and highlight
your chest area I love highlighting and
contouring and I think this is great not
only if you have smaller breasts and you
want to make them look look like you
have a little bit more cleavage which
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that um even me I do have quite a bit of
cleavage sometimes my bra doesn't push
my boobs up enough and I'm like oh so
you can create your own way bitch there
without having to choke on your own
booze whether they're large or small for
those of you who don't have very big
breasts and you just want a little more
without plastic surgery well then you
can just contour your breasts a little
bit and you can also we're going to be
contouring the clavicle area which is
going to give us that nice sleek skinny
feminine appeal on the chest area and it
turns out so freakin gorgeous I cannot
wait to show you this tutorial I cannot
wait for you to see it if you do enjoy
it and learn something from it give it a
thumbs up I love you guys and let's get
started get started I'm gonna be going
in with my Bobbi Brown foundation stick
this is in shade warm almond 6.5 and I'm
going to start contouring the chest
versus highlighting the chest to contour
the chest first I like to actually
contour my clavicle so I'll go
underneath the clavicles
like that I'm going to add a little bit
on top it's a little more difficult to
do it on my right side I am right-handed
I'm gonna go underneath the clavicle and
then drag it down kind of like a natural
just whoop so this is the places that
shadows naturally hit so it keeps it
kind of natural and then the boobs what
I like to do is pick up the boob and
then you see that natural contour but
whenever my boob is flat I don't have
that so we're going to create that I'm
going to start in the center and just
contour that natural shadow doing the
same thing if you don't have like any
move at all to push up it happens you
can push up your skin and you can see
what your skin naturally folds there
there is our contour easy peasy
that's all we have you want to take a
look at that screen shot the video do
what you need to do Oh almost forgot so
there's a natural you in the neck I did
that sloppy but we'll blend it out I
like to create a contour at that too
next for my highlight just because this
shade is so good for my highlight it's
y31 by then makeup forever
concealer I'm just going to go in with a
little brush I got it on the back of my
hand here and I'm going to conceal or I
shouldn't be saying it so I'm going to
highlight the areas that I didn't
contour so we want to push these areas
out and make them look bigger or where
the light naturally hits more so then
look bigger but we do want this part to
look bigger so I'm going to go ahead and
highlight that I'll do the shoulders
I'll add a little bit of concealer right
under here right under here I apologize
that my chest is red is because I kind
of wiped down my chest to get I don't
know I just want a really nice clean
palate before I start it and that's why
my chest is red from where I wiped it
down a little bit there just a touch
right there that's pretty much good and
we'll focus on blending it out you can
use either a brush or a sponge I'm gonna
start blending out the highlight with my
brush I'm gonna hold the boot because my
boob is pretty not pretty large I guess
it's it's it's there and so it jiggles
so I'm gonna hold it still a little bit
and then we're just gonna blend that all
over and the trick is really taking your
time with blending out that contour
really want to take your tone both but
that contour you want to be really
precise blending out so I'm just gonna
drag that down and then really just
start stippling and doing sort of small
swiping motions
you
and we're actually going to go in with
the end of this brush here bite hard and
we're just going to swipe softly and get
all this lid it out and then we'll go in
with a Beauty Blender just to really
soften it up and make sure there's no
harshness going on
and we'll go in with the Beautyblender
and just soften that up even more even
more can barely talk some pounding on my
chest
now we have everything pretty much
blended out and soften and not only this
this makeup on your chest it's just
gonna make your chest look so flawless
so if you have a little bit of
discoloration which I've dealt with in
the past or in the chest area this is
going to help out with that too there's
a bit of coverage with all this makeup
so now what we're going to do is we are
going to actually set everything that
everything first I'll go in my
tried-and-true Laura Mercier translucent
powder this is an awesome setting powder
and I'm just going to take s25 brush
from Sigma and I'm only going to place
this pretty much in the areas that I
highlighted this is going to make it
last all night long make sure it doesn't
smudge I would say make sure it doesn't
crease but this is in the under eye area
so we don't really have to worry about
the creasing then I'm just going to take
this on the Sacha contour kit and I'm
going to take the shade Java in this
little tart contour brush I use this in
to blend out the contour now I'll use
the other end just to deepen it up a
little bit
I want to do is go in with a highlighter
and this is pearl buy back with
cosmetics it's a super light highlighter
you can go in with any highlighter you
have on hand and this is the fo3
highlight brush we're going to highlight
the clavicles it's going to make them
look really beautiful soft shimmery and
even stand out more and it gives your
chest like that thin appearance I mean
this is all preference if you want all
this preference if you want it or not
you can even highlight the boobage a
little bit just to give it you see that
little bit of glow you only want to
highlight the areas where you highlight
it and not the areas where you contoured
that is it for this tutorial
that is it for this video don't forget

think that's all I have for you guys so
