have a super full face and makeup on
today because I'm going to be showing
you how to contour and highlight I'm not
just gonna put the color to my face but
I'm gonna apply them and tell you why
I'm gonna apply them in white and
benefits you and what you're doing you
get what I'm saying a heads up I am
going to be using these quick fix sticks
by dermablend
these are awesome for contouring and
highlighting because one the shape it's
like a little stick so it's super easy
to contour and highlight with and also a
little bit of these goes like a super
long way so you know you just want to
use like a touch and not be too too
generous with these because you will
have a face full of makeup so you just
take a little swipe and then you'll see
how I use them but just know a little
bit of these goes a really long way
these are awesome for contouring and
highlighting because of their shape and
because of how easily they blend out so
I have a link to all the products I'm
using from dermablend down below as well
as a discount code called face sculpt
you can save 10 to 15 dollars off your
products and more information is down in
the description box so check it anyways
we're just gonna jump right in this
video and we're going to get started on
contouring and highlighting our face to
start off contouring and highlighting
I'm going to go ahead and add primer and
foundation to my face for primer I'm
going to be using the NYX angel build
skin perfecting primer and I like to use
this one because it is oil free and it
smoothes out the skin leaving you with a
flawless finish for underneath your
makeup that Willing your makeup sits on
top of it it looks really good
typically I just apply this in places
that need a little bit more smoothing
out because we are going to be using a
heavy makeup today I especially like the
fact that it's all free next time
foundation I'm going to be using the
Maybelline matte and poreless is one of
my favorite foundations and I am in
color 220 I'm just going to be applying
a thin layer of foundation you don't
want to go too heavy but remember we're
going to be covering a lot of our face
with the contour and the highlight did
you did you did you do do do did it I
did it alright watch parts done so now
we're going to move on to the
highlighting section of this video what
are we using natural which is a really
good color for me I
one to two shades lighter than my actual
foundation color with the concealer that
I'm choosing to use which again this is
the quick fix by Dharma Blin when you're
highlighting face what you're doing is
you are pushing the areas out you want
these areas to look bright happy
awakened so just the under eye area
whenever you highlight down the nose and
the forehead you're kind of pushing that
area out therefore you're not trying to
sink it in and hide it you want it to be
shown and happy so remember you put the
highlight in the areas that you want to
stand out your highlighting it get it
starting out I'm going to take this
concealer stick the shape oh it's nice
because it allows for a precise
application I'm going to run this
underneath the eye area like that now
I'm going to do a triangle shape rather
than a rounded shape that the light
naturally shines down on your face and I
triangular shape so this is going to
give you more of a natural appearance
rather than rounding it out in the under
eye area alright and my voice is getting
a little cracky a little bit of this
stuff goes a really long way by the way
so if you notice I apply it and then I'm
kind of smoothing it out with my finger
make sure you wash your hands if you're
touching your face so I have a small for
it so I can actually bring my highlight
up a little bit higher because that's
gonna push the forehead out and make it
look just a little bit bigger because my
forehead is it's super small once you
see my whole face and like my hair's
down it looks really small but if you
have a big forehead at this point you
want to make it look smaller you're
gonna bring your highlight to about here
maybe a little bit lower than Midway
because you don't want your forehead to
stand down you love your big forehead
well then all by all means do you thank
girl
highlighter pin I'm literally gonna do
like to swipe ease and I'm just going to
kinda I'm gonna go ahead and cover the
whole unibrow area too so now what I'll
do is I'll go ahead and run it down the
nose this is going to give us the
illusion of a perfectly straight skinny
symmetrical nose just running that
highlight straight down so it even
connects to the poor head area now I
want my lip area to look nice big and
plump so what I'm going to do is that
just a little bit to the upper lip area
now I want my chin to be a little bit
more poked out and nice and round it
just going to add
they're right there so now what I like
to do is add a little bit right here and
we bit right here I mean you can even
add just a touch with these sticks and
just blend it with your finger that way
you don't get too much product on your
face it's not going to actually touch
the chin but it's going to come down
pretty far and will actually blend all
this up that is the highlighted areas
these are the areas I want to stand out
I want that beautiful jawline I want my
under-eye split freshman awake I want my
forehead to look a little bit bigger my
nose to look straight and my chin to
look perfectly round now we'll talk
about contouring I'll be using bronze
and the Quick Pick stick same product
looks the exact same
a little bit goes a long way don't
forget it typically to make the forehead
look smaller you'll go ahead and hit the
areas where the Sun will naturally hit
which is the temple areas and this is
going to give you a more of a natural
type of contour rather than a super
harsh contour so what I'm going to do
again because a little bit goes a long
way I'm literally just going to do like
three dots and I'm just going to kind of
tap it to move the color around with my
finger and then I'll do like literally
the smallest amount right here that
should be enough for the forehead for me
and I'm actually gonna bring my
highlight up a little bit more on point
your nose you can literally make your
nose look almost any way that you want
it to I have a pretty skinny nose but if
I make like contouring it it just
doesn't match my face because I have
like this structured face and my nose is
like white from the hot light so I want
to contour my nose even though it's
pretty skinny like it's the skinny
pointy nose but that's okay so normally
I will run the smallest amount straight
down the nose on each side if you want a
little cute button around it nose at the
tip you can even kind of come across the
end of the nose right there and you can
just like blend that part out too or the
cheekbone areas this is my favorite part
of contouring just making those
cheekbones pop you can slenderize your
face a ton by contouring your face the
right way so what I'm going to do I'm
pulling this hair back because I want to
start in about the center of the ear
right about here where the tragus is and
I want to bring it but if you bring it
too far it can start to like you have
like a mustache or like a five o'clock
shadow growing so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to apply the product
like that very
in amount same thing over here this is
like I do a fiber little foundation
brush I don't even know where it's from
it's just super affordable little cheap
brush here and I'm just gonna gonna add
a little bit more really want to keep a
straight line right here that way you
have a sharp nice crisp contour if you
move it around too much you can kind of
just like you have a really rounded
brown cheek and it's not really doing
anything as far as changing the
structure of your face so yet Linda yet
I'm talking about with the lightest hand
possible if you don't have a lot of time
to blend your contour I highly recommend
doing maybe just bronzing up the face
but if you have a lot of time to do your
makeup well then by all means contour
away but basically you see how I'm not
moving the product down any I'm focusing
on really moving it up rather than down
and that way we're keeping that straight
line what I'm doing here spreading out
the product on the face and that way the
product can get settled where it needs
to be and that way the body heat from my
skin and my body is going to warm this
up and it's going to make it even easier
to blend out but I want to first place
the product where it needs to go where I
just add a little bit and as you can see
it's just going to end up giving that
perfectly round beautiful chin good as
you can see like that little base wide
look how much it blend it out and
covered it's crazy the product now has
set on my face for probably five to ten
minutes the highlight ten minutes to
contour probably more like five minutes
it's warmed up the more it's warmed up
the easier it is to blend out so what
I'm going to do now is I'm going to go
in with my Beauty Blender I'm going to
blend out the highlight bugle inner is
dampened in a very important part you
should know about this before you start
blending is you don't want to move this
product Realms we place this product in
a particular area to do certain things
to our face so you don't want to like
bring the highlight all the way out here
or just move it around crazy you want to
keep it in the same place you wouldn't
believe how much a product would blend
out by just simply dabbing and pushing
it into the skin it's gonna blend out
it's just going to take a little bit
more time this is like a really great
product to blend out that highlight so
I'm not going to be swiping I'm gonna be
more dabbing to keep it in the
particular area
we've strategically placed it in
with a nose area because it's such a
tiny precise area I'm actually going to
use my little finger right here and I'm
just literally going to dab it out with
my finger now we'll work on blending out
this contour I prefer using a brush was
letting out my contour so I'm gonna go
in with this little duo fiber brush I'm
going to start swiping I'm come out I'm
using the lightest hand possible because
again this is going to take a little bit
of time that way it is nicely I'm
actually going to blend it out into my
hair that way it looks more natural
I do these teeny tiny circular motions
be sure not to blend it too hard down
here because I don't want to mess up
that perfect little line that we created
bringing it around the forehead I'm
going to do the same thing I'm going to
blend it into my hair and then so this
chakra line right here from the
highlight looks really unnatural and
we're actually going to blend our
contour on down and that way that's
going to soften that up a little bit and
that way we don't have any harsh lines
and everything looks really nice more
ant thing with a nose area I'm just
gonna soften that up a little bit with
my finger now we are nice and blended
out but we're not done yet so I have so
much cream product on my face right now
that if I just walked away it would
start to move and slough we have to set
it and that is super crucial when doing
this I'm going to be using this setting
powder from dermablend
is their professional setting powder
what I like to do is just knock a little
bit out into the lid and take this brush
right here which is dumb shapes it's
perfect for getting up in the highlight
we're setting the highlight first by the
way I'm going to get a little on the
brush tap it off and then I'm literally
going to just press it look how lightly
I'm we're going to sharpen up our line a
little bit or where we moved it a touch
but I will literally do this is a form
called cooking what it's going to do is
let my body heat and actually warm up
this powder and it's going to set this
concealer for days it's going to make
the highlight last longer it's going to
help it not to crease mainly lasts
longer and also I noticed with the
highlight under the eyes that eyeliner
and mascara can kind of run down and do
it if you don't have a powder to set it
so it's going to prevent all of that and
it's going to make it even brighter and
it's even going to sharpen up and clean
up this contour a little bit so it does
a number of great things and we're going
to cook we're not just going to rub it
in I apply it I apply an abundant amount
in strategic places and I'm going to let
it set there and let my natural body
heat warm up the powder and make
everything work just so much better and
be more intending minutes gone by same
brush go back in I'm going to very
gently just swipe away that excess
because our contour has faded a little
bit just because we've been doing so
much highlighting I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of my urban decay powder this
is actually a foundation powder by them
and it's a little bit too dark for me so
it's perfect for setting the contour men
take a little brush like this about
medium size I'm actually just going to
run it right on top of the contour and
I'm just going to really light hand I'm
just going to start blending it out and
basically I'm going to keep that nice
stripe on my face and I'm just going to
soften it up just the upper part of it
doing small circular motions with a
really light hand
as far as the nose goes I'm just going
to take a little bitty bit of the
bronzer like the smallest amount and I'm
just going to set the nose as well
typically at this point I would then go
in and add just a little bit of blush
and whatever highlighter I want it to
add and this is our finished look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
