have partnered up with jargons and I'm
going to show you how I get my tan I'm
going to be using with Jergens natural
glow instant Sun all over my body than
the Jergens natural glow face for my
face I've been using jargons forever
they're affordable and they're so easy
to use so if you guys want to see how I
tan at my body and my face keep watching
and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel for you lead up those 3 videos a
week and I don't want you to miss now so
hit the subscribe button just to run out
of each products this one again it's
more of like an instant tanner so it's a
self tanner and you just apply it as
opposed to dry and 60 seconds for
instant tanning product comes out like a
mousse and it does come in this nice
little convenient pump bottle which I
like a lot and you can kind of build up
a tan with this stuff so if you wanted a
darker color you can just up repeat the
process the next day I like to use shade
deep bronze because I really like to get
my tan on
for best results when tanning my body I
do like to shower and exfoliate my skin
first that way I get any of the rough
dead skin off and I just get a nice
flawless even tan going over how I
actually use the product I like to pump
out two foam pumps in my hand rub it
together in a small circular motion
start with the top of my leg when
applying the product in the knee area
you want to use it sparingly that way
you get a nice even tan for the second
half of my leg I do two more pumps and
massage it into the bottom part of my
leg and then whatever's left
I'll scooch over the knee ankle and the
top of my foot area and then I will let
it dry for 60 seconds and I'll show you
the difference so as you can see on the
left side that leg has been tanned and
the other leg hasn't been touched here
is a picture of both of my legs
completely finished after its dried for
60 seconds and you can see quite a bit
of difference let me just let you know
for best results I like to shave and
exfoliate and moisturize my legs before
I add any tanner to them it just
provides the most even tan on your legs
now let's talk a little bit about the
natural glow daily moisturizer this one
is made specifically for your face so
this is a gradual tan which I like a lot
for your face because it can be kind of
scary applying like a deep Tanner just
an instant deep tanner to your face like
to build up in the weekend
estimize your tan on your face as remain
my face is a lot lighter than my body so
I really enjoy this product it does have
SPF 20 in it be sure to use it as
directed and actually apply this to your
face kind of like you would a daily
moisturizer just make sure you apply
evenly all over your face
it does moisturize the skin and of
course it builds a natural tan so to get
a natural gradual tan you want to use
this daily you want to use it after you
wash your face and just to get a
flawless tan you want to make sure
you're blending it you know into your
hairline avoid the eyebrow areas and be
sure you're dragging it on down to the
draw line area you want to be sure to
wait a few minutes for it to fully
absorb into your skin and then you
definitely need to wash your hands after
one that I like to use is medium to tan
hope you guys enjoy the video be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
and I'll see you all in my next video
