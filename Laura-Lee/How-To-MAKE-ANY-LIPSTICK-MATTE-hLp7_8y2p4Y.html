video is gonna be a how-to video it's
going to be very interesting moves we're
gonna turn any luster ii glossy lipstick
into a matte lipstick AKA kind of
looking like a liquid lipstick and i
know that super popular right now
personally all i wear on my lips
normally is a matte shade i tend to
always opt for matte shade i don't know
what it is but I'm just like so freaking
obsessed with it have two different ways
to show you guys how to do it one
there's a product that came out that
does that I'm going to share with you
it's really freaking cool I'll demo it
out - and - there's a DIY way that I'm
going to be showing with you that I
learned up a Pinterest hello -
everything off of Pinterest I'm really
excited you're here thanks for being
here subscribe before you leave because
there's a lot of cool awesome videos
going on on this channel and I don't
want you to miss out join the YouTube
fam Jam today you can click right here
or if you're on your cell phone you can
click down below because that is where
the scribe button is chances are it's
probably down here and I'm pointing down
here I hope you're excited to see the
video we're gonna jump right in get
started your first way to get that magic
lip out of any lipstick is a new product
from Smashbox this video has been
sponsored by this product or by Smashbox
or anything like that I just got it and
it's amazing so I want to share with you
guys but I do have a DIY way I'm about
to show you but anyways this is instant
matte so you can put on top of any light
luster or glossy lipstick and it
basically turns it into a liquid
lipstick or it gives you that nice flat
matte finish which is so popular right
now so we're gonna be using a lipstick I
happen to have a Smashbox but I'll also
test it out with a Mac one as well but
this one's called inspiration and it's a
lustre so it's glossy looking whenever
you finish applying it so I'm gonna demo
it out and show you guys how we're gonna
make this
right so we have fully applied a regular
luster II lipstick so now we're gonna
apply the insta matte and we're gonna
make it a met Libby
it comes in a tube like this it's like a
lip gloss
just like that easy peasy lemon squeezy
our lips are just as mad as they can be
this is an absolutely amazing product
one recommendation I have for you
obviously wipe it off whenever you get
done to your next color or like push out
the excess so that your next color
doesn't have the pink in it like if you
want it to wear a different color now
the recommendation I have for you when
you think is is to only use a little bit
of product and try to like smooth it out
as much as you can you can even use like
a lip brush or something like that this
is not a lip brush I use a lip brush cuz
I like to break rules and stuff like
that but just to spurge the product out
so it doesn't become chunky too so you
can get like those edges on your mouth
and get them matte as well so you don't
have like some shine going on there but
it's a really cool product very easy to
use just very simple product to use so
and I think it's an amazing invention
now we'll try it out with a MAC lipstick
just to show you it works with different
brands other than just smash book book
cash box products because I mean that
way you wanted to buy all Smashbox
lipsticks to be able to use it because I
would defeat the purpose of making every
lipstick matte so we're gonna try that
with this next oh yeah now I am applying
blankety which is a let's see and
amplify so it has a lot of pigment in it
that's what that means by Mac but it's
also like a luster it's very glossy
looking once you get it on I'm going to
apply and we're going to do the instant
mount with this lipstick aid I mentioned
that blink these when my favorite
lipsticks a verb
here is a blank me with an instant mat
on top it works very well I really like
the product honestly it turns it into
like a soft matte lip cream so it's a
little bit more moisturizing than just
wearing a matte liquid lipstick so it's
beneficial in that way
I like the promit product I don't think
it's too gimmicky or weird I think it
works I just think you have to apply a
little and it is truly best just to kind
of buff it out with a brush around the
corners of your mouth to go back in just
to get all the corners really nude
well your lipstick is glossy that way
you have like a nice even finish of
madness if that makes any sense that's
my one go I'm creating any lipstick
being matte with this product now I'm
going to show you a DIY way if you don't
want to get this product on how to do it
I've gone ahead and applied to bonnet by
MAC Cosmetics to my lips now the trick
is to take an eyeshadow shade that is
matte that has no shimmer and then that
is similar to the color on your lips
that's right
and you're just going to gently take an
eyeshadow brush and dab it on to the lip
color and it will mattify any lipstick
look how matte my lips turned out and
honestly to me this looks better than a
little lipstick just because you're not
going to deal with any of that dry
cracky see it's just very very smooth
application whenever you do this I did
totally darken up my lip because the
eyeshadow shade was bitten by makeup
geek so it's just like a little bit of
darker shade and I knew that going into
it because I didn't have an eyeshadow
that was quite that bright in red color
that was Matt I didn't have any shimmer
but that's okay because I like this
color better actually but just a quick
tip if you were going for a you know
matte pink lip and you didn't have a
matte pink I showed you you can also use
a matte blush or if you were going for a
brownish lip color that has shine in it
you want to take the shine out you could
do a matte bronzer on top just any matte
powder or makeup product set it on top
and it will mattify your lipstick it's
an absolutely amazing trick that's it
for this video I hope it was helpful for
