video is going to be a hot topic and it
is how to get perfectly liner every
single time you do your liner and I'm
going to show you how I do pretty well
with winged liner I mean I do have bad
winged liner days because I am human but
I am going to get you the gist of like
how to get it really good how did it get
in a good notion emotion I have a couple
of tips and tricks to share with you
guys because we're going to get you to
slick that white liner also if you
haven't subscribed to my channel yet
subscribe before you leave join the
YouTube fame gym I post three videos a
week and I don't want you to miss out on
my video so uh subscribe but if I sound
a little stuffy it's because I am stuffy
allergies are welcome my hiney let's
jump right in to get started it is
really quick when I tell you what tools
that I'm going to be using um I eat a
lot of questions and everything will be
linked you know where where they gonna
be late
let's say it together in the description
box I knew you knew first we'll go with
the brushes that I use so first um where
is my liner brush first I mean there's
two that I like a lot
first is the e10 I use this brush every
single day pretty much it's just like a
teeny tiny perfect winged liner brush
it's by Sigma and the second is the eo6
is teeny teeny tiny but it has like this
angle on it to get you get though and
it's just like all in your preference I
used to use this one every single day
and now I use the e10 every day so I
just saw I mentioned both so because it
was really awesome brushes and also the
liner that I prefer it's a more people
like gel liner and slight if this liner
is dirt cheap look it's the cheapest gel
liner and if it is a liquid liner I
prefer the NYC liquid liner it's like
two dollars to the drugstore I like both
of them because they're very matte black
and that's typically what I always go
for whenever we're talking about winged
liner I want to be very very black and I
want to be mad
there's one more product I want to
mention to you guys this is English
duraline out a friend I'm going to move
to California recommend this to me we
went to Namie's together and we got it
and this is a really cool product it's
not even that expensive
I don't think um you can dip it into
your eyeliner or you can even mix and
eyeshadow with it and make eyeliner or
basically the point is if your eyeliner
dries out this will prolong the life of
your liner it just makes it it almost
turns your gel liner into a liquid liner
if you put a lot of it if you put just
like one small dot it will just bring
your gel liner back to life cause you
jump right in and do some wine Ilana
yo yo they jumping right in the first
thing I always like to do is start in
the inner corner and then I'll kind of
do a little bit on that outer corner I
don't know why I do this but it helps me
like get a guideline on the base of my
upper lashes that way we don't get too
crazy another thing that helps me is to
get just this very small amount of
eyeliner on my brush and go back in
several times dipping the brush into the
product instead of going in with a fully
loaded brush because then it can slip
and slide around and get a little bit
messy and it makes it more difficult to
work with I also have a pretty terrible
habit of grabbing my skin to tighten it
to get a really straight line across my
upper lash line I don't recommend doing
this it can be damaging to your skin in
the long run it's just one of my bad
habits we're going to do the most
important part the wing I like to start
heavy at the base with a little bit more
pressure and I'll lighten the pressure
of the brush as I go up then I will
start about a quarter of the way out and
push the liner all the way back in and
then I will fill in that area obviously
where there's no liner and I'll just
keep kind of brushing it over to make
sure that line is super super super
straight and here's an overview of the
end result of that was my fault flashes
on of course it just looks nice and
clean so now what I'm actually going to
do is I'm going to show you how if you
mess up the wing part how you can
correct it all right so here goes if you
mess up that outer corner of that wing
you'll take a synthetic brush and a
little bit of concealer on both sides of
the brush oh so gently you are going to
very lightly feather that concealer on
the edge of that wing just to swipe away
and clean up any mess this is a great
way of cleaning it up and not mess
up your eyeshadow as well and also if
you have a blunt in on your wing you can
sharpen up that wing with this trick
right here as you can see my wing is
super sharp and normally I'll just take
like my finger and Pat it out make sure
it looks really smooth what the
concealer is let me just tell you really
quickly a little story that's my
background wing liner and how I got used
to doing mine just like quick and easy
and pretty good I consider myself pretty
good at it
pat myself on the back before I took my
shower cuz I'm a night shower or wash my
face whatever I would get out my liquid
liner and I would practice doing my wing
liner and if I screwed it up completely
I was washing my face anyway so what did
it matter but I would just give me two
chances to practice I did every single
day like I practice my wing liner like I
was studying for tests I was like okay
tonight's the night you know I get it
like oh okay
one thing too about liner I know this is
funny but it's not it is but it isn't
um you do have to be like not nervous
like you have to be like look you're my
bitch and I'm gonna own you and you're
gonna act right okay okay if you're like
oh god I'm gonna screw it up or nervous
or any kind of jittery or shaky it's
gonna happen
you're gonna freak out you're gonna mess
it up so just be cool calm down lay your
winged liner know you're scared of it
show who's boss and may and handle that
winged liner I just gave you a pep top
