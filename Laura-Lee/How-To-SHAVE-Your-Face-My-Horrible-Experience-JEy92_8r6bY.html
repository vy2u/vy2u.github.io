video is going to be have it shave your
face I'm going to talk about why I shave
my face and I'm going to talk about all
the mistakes I've made in the past with
shaving my face so that way maybe can
help you with shaving your face if
you're interested in doing that or if
you just saw this weird girl on YouTube
you said to click this video I hope it's
somewhat entertaining for you at least
the part with all of my mistakes because
oh yeah I've made um have a super hairy
face it's really attractive shaving my
face was something I neglected for a
long time until I really gotten to make
it which I've always really been into
makeup but the amount of makeup that I
wear the more you wear it's just better
whenever you shave your face this is
probably something I should not be
saying in an intro it's probably
something I should moreso be talking
about like during the video so let me
stop there we're gonna jump right in and
get started but be sure before you leave
to subscribe to my channel because we do
lots of fun crazy weird awkward cool
videos on my channel and I don't want
you to miss out so subscribe join my
youtube page gym today don't do
dig-dig-dig to take do or not do
whatever you want I don't care I care
yeah so let's let's go shave our face
first thing you want to do whenever
shaving your face is get a really good
shaving cream I like to use barber so
thick and rich shaving cream put it
everywhere honestly just kidding
you don't need shaving cream okay I'm
gonna go wash this off
honestly I saw that on Hulu beauty's
Instagram and I had to stop shaving your
face with the Rays there is a no-no let
me tell you why I did it weren't from me
actually you know what if you shave your
face with a razor and it works out great
for you you're not having any issues
with it by all means shave your face
with that razor girlfriend or boyfriend
whoever you are out there it didn't work
out for me and don't
I like you've never taken a razor to the
stash every woman goes a little bit of
peach fuzz some peach fuzz is darker
than others mine for instance is
probably darker than my husband
what I can't help it I'm only human okay
I've been there I took a razor and I
went for it and it didn't turn out well
for me and let me say this I worked a
dermatologist for four
dermatology is skin hair and nails and
the number one question we got asked
well if I shave my hair doesn't it grow
back thicker a myth a completely total
myth it appears thicker and it feels
thicker and the reason why is because
your hair naturally comes out and the
end of your hair is a fine point if you
shave it with a razor it's going to grow
back with a blunt point at the end and
it's going to appear up here a bit
thicker and it's definitely gonna feel a
lot thicker but it's not actually
growing thicker hair if that was the
case I always shave my eyebrows off
every day and wait for them to grow back
thicker but it doesn't work like that
mythbuster Here I am is Mythbusters
hiring No
okay that's a myth but it does change
the texture of your hair and the way it
grows back so that is more shave my face
with something like this No also I've
seen lots of videos and I've done it
before with the little straight blade
racers where you just it and get the
hair off it's kind of does the same
thing as making it grow back with like
that blunt end and Phil's way thicker or
just looks thicker it didn't work for me
and let me tell you the main reason it
didn't work for me it cause razor bumps
razor bumps on my face not my crotch it
wasn't well um and I tried it I mean
like I have a full manly sideburn but
also I've hair that goes right here it's
dark Pete peach fuzz and that's where I
did it and it was just like bumps
everywhere was it was bad it was really
bad so then I went in my parents like
get your face threaded they just thread
your face six cruciate Upen but it's
over and then like it pulls the hair
from the root so your hair goes back you
know with that fine point so it doesn't
feel a weird texture so I go and I'm
like okay I'll get my face threaded it's
cheap it only takes a few seconds it
hurts very bad but beauty is pain so I
did it do you know what happened to me
do you want to know what the hell
happened to me the thread just she just
thread it she did a great job
I didn't have razor burn or breakouts or
it didn't grow back weird or anything
when I put on my makeup
the next day you could see a little like
I had tiger stripes on my face where the
thread had bounced across my cheek and
it like ripped out some hair like it
looked like I live
really had just drew lines with makeup
and it was because it was like hair no
hair hair no hair where the thread just
went across my cheek look crazy for like
two weeks until my hair could grow back
in my face so threading didn't work for
me if you don't wear a lot of makeup
like a lot a lot of makeup um
threading may be the answer for you
although you do have to go somewhere to
get it done your hair goes back just as
fast and it hurts like a bitch
I mean my face wax it was the same issue
as threading unless they wax my whole
entire face you could tell where the
baby hair started and where it was just
pure smooth skin so I'm like okay I'm
just gonna be Chewbacca I give up
finally I found one of these little guys
right here it is this video isn't
sponsored by the way but it's like this
little electric razor I've seen them on
infomercials I got off a website and
honest to god I can't remember the name
of the website but I will do full
research find the website and link it
down below I believe it was like 10
bucks but also I've mentioned this
before in a favorites video and someone
said they found them at like Ross or TJ
Maxx for like 5 bucks
these are everywhere you get these at
like the dollar store they're like
little electric trimmers a term on and
this one actually has like a light on it
it's super fond say and it's kind of in
the answer to all my issues I'm gonna
show you how I use it it's very easy to
youtube real clean up my brows shit
moustache I'm not why guys I've like
stuck it in my nose before what oh you
have nose hair too
don't judge me Jesus is not hiring it
does cut the hair off to a blunt point
but I don't notice my hair being as
stiffly as if I cut it off with a razor
like it's a much smoother outcome and
like if I'm in my close-up mirror do my
eyebrows and I see you like little hairs
coming back I'm like oh hell now let me
get my mirror so we don't screw anything
up the light on my face that I don't
want the blade touch my face like I
literally just set it down and just move
it up I'm only setting the plastic on my
face not the blades and I go up and see
like so much hair coming
for that I do it to my neck all right I
know you see like look at that hair I'm
a hairy beast I get the unibrow and then
I'll even like pull my eyebrows this
parts tricky you can shave your eyebrows
and if you do don't call me I told you
the first tricky but I will literally
get these hairs if I'm too lazy to plus
on my favorite part is getting above my
eyebrow look at the hair coming off you
can do the upper lip it doesn't get such
close of a shave where it's going to
leave different marketing in your makeup
but a gets close up shows close enough
shade to where the hair isn't visible
it's not too close where you're not
going to get razor burn because the hair
is still outside of the skin it's not
like cutting the hair at the base of the
skin you're trying to do something at
home that's affordable this is where
it's at with no issues I know not
everybody's going to get razor burn from
using a razor but I did and I would
never do it again because it looked like
I just had a bunch of acne from the hair
on my face it was just a big mess and
actually took a long time to get rid of
the razor burn hope this video was
helpful for you guys and show me your
face be sure to subscribe to my channel

all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
