hurt Justin Bieber Justin Bieber's hair
today hi Justin you're watching this
just Hey
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be talking about the
cake face disaster that may have struck
us all at one point or another in our
lifetime of makeup
it's definitely habit of me I come home
look in the mirror and it was like so
I'm going to talk to you guys about how
to avoid this it's gonna be a little bit
different than my makeup do's and don'ts
it's just more so tips and tricks on how
to get flawless finish but not look too
cakey you cray-cray
I got a lot of tips and tricks for you
in this video I'm going to be testing
out a trio here the Smashbox photo
finish primer at the Smashbox Studios
Skin Foundation and I'm going to be
introducing you guys to the new Smashbox
Studios skin concealer brand new people
also if you haven't subscribed to my
channel yet and I said yes be sure to
subscribe you know join my youtube fame
gym do lots of weird crazy testing out
stuff on this channel alright
interesting
sorry illness right so that's what the
announcements of how we're gonna jump
right in and get started right now
alright the first tip I have for
avoiding the cake base or just get that
flawless smooth skin finish when doing
your foundation is to exfoliate your
skin i exfoliate my skin only one time a
week because I'm normal to dry skin and
it dries it out if I exfoliate any more
than that but I don't recommend over
exfoliating over exfoliating your skin
will definitely lead to a lot of texture
on your skin and breakouts I wouldn't
exfoliate more than three times a week
and yeah maybe like once a week
exfoliate your skin and get all that
dead rough skin off and get that polish
skin to get a beautiful flawless finish
my next tip to get that smooth beautiful
skin under your foundation is to
moisturize your skin and even if you
have oily skin I recommend moisturizing
i recommend motorizing every single day
with a gel moisturizer versus a cream
moisturizer this is a tip I learned
while working at the dermatologist a gel
moisturizer is water-based so it's not
going to break you out versus a cream
moisturizer which most of the time is
old based and things just get cry-cry
from there on so you're going to use a
gel based moisturizer it may feel oily
skin you just use like a tiny pea sized
amount of moisturizer
and add it on to get that plush smooth
hydrated skin to my favorite gel ones
this one's actually a serum so it's
really lightweight this is the tatcha
pore perfecting water gel moisturizer
and then another one I love both these
can be found at Sephora is the belief
true cream aqua balm it says true cream
but it is definitely a blue gel
moisturizer and its really awesome how I
use a cream moisturizer loma hold I have
is it like the next day and I have dry
skin and then crazy my next tip is
definitely a facial primer so you know
the texture on your skin or the pores
that shows through a facial primer can
eliminate all of that I like to use the
Smashbox photo-finish this is their
foundation primer this one actually on
an award this is like the number one
primer in the u.s. it is bomb calm and
it's amazing for smoothing out the skin
another key thing is don't use too much
primer don't go crazy and with primer
don't cover your whole entire face
ear-to-ear forehead to chin with it you
can just apply in areas that you really
need it which is what I typically do i
just massage it in a circular motion
right around this area where my pores
are just a little bit larger than I
would like them to be don't add too much
product because we want to keep it light
want to keep our skin airy and we don't
want the cake face to attack next up
we're going to talk about applying
foundation now I have quite a few tips
and tricks for you with this part and
not getting it all Keiko cooker first of
all don't use a heavy cakey foundation a
good one is the Smashbox to your skin
foundation and a bonus this is a 15 hour
where foundation is amazing for lasting
through the heat the sweat the tears and
the book I'm just kidding that was too
much it is amazing for lasting through
heat your sweat you're gonna have a long
day you gonna be wearing a long time
you'd be working a little tushy off this
is a great foundation for you for
lasting power bonus there are 22 new
shades in this foundation let's color
consistent in any light so it's going to
look great no matter what lighting
you're in it looks amazing and studio
lighting so when using this I like to
start off with a very small amount of
foundation and dab it on my face and
then start to blend it out you don't
want to start with too much foundation
all over your face and then trying to
work all that foundation in you can just
start with a very small amount and then
you'll start to blend it out on your
skin which leaves me
my next tip when using a beauty blender
or your makeup brush whatever you might
be using to blend it out you don't want
to rub and start scrubbing your
foundation into your skin when you get
brush streaks but that's not the whole
point it will give you a very textured
feel it could irritate dry skin bring up
little flakes if you have a zit in the
area and you're rubbing your foundation
it can irritate the zit make it a little
bit inflamed pull up some dead skin and
then you have that unfollows finish so
you just want to do a tapping stippling
dabbing motion just blend out the
foundation you will have a flawless
finish
mark my words so if you have a pimple or
something you don't want to actually add
concealer first in your foundation on
top of it one you just kind of wipe it
away whenever you start dabbing out your
foundation and to your foundation may
actually cover the zits you may not even
need the concealer so you could take off
that makeup that you don't need less is
more especially when we're trying to
avoid the cake face less is more that's
a very hard concept for me to learn but
you know I'm trying first apply your
foundation all over your face I have a
lot of redness around my nose but most
the time a foundation takes care of it
if it doesn't then I go in and touch up
with a little bit of concealer but first
just see what your foundation can handle
all right so let's talk about setting
our foundation setting your foundation
would be very important if you want
long-lasting foundation and for it to
not like slough and run away setting
your foundation can also lead to a lot
of cakiness in your makeup routine so
you definitely don't want to actually
set your foundation with a foundation
powder because technically foundation
powders will be create it to be worn by
themselves and if you add foundation
powder on top of foundation wear it for
like 3 to 4 hours you'll start to see a
little bit of a cakey fluffy mess
happening Plus foundation powders have a
lot of color to them because they're
meant to cover and be the color of your
skin so if you're adding that on top of
your foundation you could switch up the
color of your foundation by adding too
much of this on top and think just get
crazy and they get cakey so a way to
avoid that is you can still set your
foundation just use a translucent powder
one of my favorites is the Laura Mercier
loose translucent powder and it doesn't
flash back on camera it's basically
invisible and it's orbs all and it will
definitely set that makeup so sometimes
whenever you set your makeup you can see
the powder on your skin or you just
really white and powdery just a quick
little tip I wanted to share with you
guys that I like to do is I like to take
my damp Beauty Blender and take that
powder that's all over my face you take
that damn Beauty Blender you just Pat
the powder just like you're pressing or
melting the powder into the skin and
then you can spray it with a little bit
of whatever your favorite setting spray
is at the moment it is like melt all
that makeup into your skin and it's just
like flawless finish but without too
much makeup happening alright let's talk
about concealer so I have a special
little friend here with me today this is
the new Smashbox skin concealer and my
first tip is if you don't want cakey
makeup don't go in with like heavy
concealer because they're out there on
the market there's very very very full
coverage but after you put on your full
coverage foundation and all that jazz
and then that full coverage concealer
you're just asking for cakiness it
happens I really been enjoying the
studio skin concealer it's a waterproof
concealer but it also covers well but
isn't too heavy on the skin so I know as
you've seen me and all your favorite
Instagram artists hmm so me I'm just
kidding apply concealer and a triangular
shape all the way under your eyes that
is a lot of makeup and you want to avoid
the cakiness
you don't necessarily have to completely
cover the whole under-eye area whenever
you're applying it to your skin you can
just add a little bit and then blend it
out and a triangular like spread that
concealer out and a triangular motion
and drag the product around just a
little bit instead of taking it all
there and then working it all in trying
to get it all blended out and then also
once you're done with your foundation
and your like or redness likes around my
nose then you can add a very small
amount of concealer and just dab it out
and so doing is swiping back and forth
motion like I said will irritate the
skin make sure you're pressing just
slightly dabbing stippling out the
concealer and my last tip for avoiding
the cake face is whenever you feel like
your makeup is just like sloughing off
your skin is gotten greasy it's just
looking really textured and not pretty
you can use toilet paper this is use
more than just wiping your heinie you
can actually take a piece of toilet
paper some people like to then take the
toilet paper and pull it into another
half where it's like this very thin
tissue sheet but in my high school our
toilet paper was already thin tissued
sheets we did not have double ply I just
like to fold it like this and just take
the whole piece and just lightly press
it I've also heard of people taking the
seats to cover the toilet just NAB in
one of the bathroom cut it up and using
as an old blonde sheet which is a nifty
trick and thirdly they have these
blotter Otte by the Beautyblender
and it's just like this little gimmicky
sponge right here and you can just like
you know absorb that old the only thing
about these I can't horde bacteria so I
throw mine in the washer machine to
clean them and it works out just fine
hmm so help all my tips and tricks help
you it will definitely create a lighter
form of makeup that still has that nice
coverage that you want and it also will
help you have that nice flawless smooth
finish on your skin there are times that
I do some of these and wear heavier
makeup but it's when I'm know I'm going
to be wearing the makeup for a very
short amount of time so I don't mind if
it looks a bit heavy alright guys that's
it for this video thank you so much for
watching I love you guys be sure and
subscribe before you leave you don't
want to miss out on the craziness that I
put on this channel I'll catch you all
