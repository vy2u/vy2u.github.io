video is going to be focusing on our
nosey posies and we're going to be
talking about how to contour our nose
also in this video I want to talk to you
guys about like what contouring is
swimming I really wanted to break down
what contouring is and how it works for
you guys Before we jump into the noses
but I teach you guys how to do a couple
of different noses in this video but I
know everybody's nose is completely
different so with that being said me
teaching you just how to contour my nose
it's not gonna work for everybody's nose
out there so that's why I wanted to talk
to you guys about like how contouring
works we're gonna jump right in and get
started so oh yeah let's just do that oh
don't forget subscribe before you leave
because this is an awesome channel and I
don't want you to miss out I have just
contoured my nails and so let me just
talk to you guys about contouring and
highlighting
so when contouring you're actually
shadowing there for areas that you want
to make look smaller you're gonna add
the dark color to to shadow to make them
look smaller therefore like wearing
black makes you look smaller wearing
white may make you look bigger not
always the case well it is for me
anyways
any area that you want to make look
smaller so you have big nostrils or a
big you know the bottom part of your
nose at Triangle ischium nose you would
then put dark on the bottom part and
white on this to make it look even then
highlighting is to push areas out areas
that you want to look bigger that's one
we always highlight that under eye areas
we wanted to look push out and plush and
full and healthy and awake so we add
that triangular shape of highlight to
our under eye area so that is contouring
and highlighting and it all just depends
on your nose your nose shape doing a
dark lines down each side doesn't work
for everybody
so again just figure out your nose shape
play with your nose if you're wanting to
contour it and we can go from there so
jumping right in we'll get started we're
going to start with contouring my own
nose and I have a skinny nose but I have
a hump in the center of it I don't know
if you can see the little bump so it
whenever I do a brown contour just down
the sides of my nose it actually
accentuates the hump it makes it look
even bigger so what I like to do to fix
that is I'll grab a little bit of a
darker color right here what I will do
is I will take the brush and I will
actually put the contour
on top of my nose and then kind of come
down like that instead of dragging the
contour straight down the sides of my
nose I'm telling you it just makes it
look ten times worse so it would be
better if I just didn't contour my nose
if I was going to do it like that and
this goes back into me explaining that
this that one contour method does not
work for every nose so again just kind
of just to make the tip of the nose look
nice and round it that way my nose just
doesn't look so skinny this is such a
great way of doing the nose without
having a nose job and it wash this off
if you don't like it that will highlight
the nose as well I will add some
highlights I want that nice rounded nose
and then I will also just highlight
right up the bridge of the nose and then
we'll blend all this out and this works
really well for if you have a skinny
nose or like a hump in your nose I would
just like to add a disclaimer that I
know my nose in the intro looked a
little bit harsh and that's because I
was trying out a new bronzer to contour
my nose before I start the video and I
didn't realize how crazy it looked
forgive me that's not the outcome of
this what I'm doing right here you will
see the final look of this also every
product I use in this video will be in
the description so be sure to check it
out
now I'm going to bring in my friend
Linna so we have a guest star today and
we're gonna contour her nose we're gonna
hook it up this is my friend Linna and
she has this fabulous nose she's gonna
let me play with today
first of all linda has this lovely nose
with a nice flat top on it so we're
gonna actually be able to go straight
down on her nose with the contour she is
a very very slight hump so just like me
well actually yours is a little bit
softer than mine so I'm going to take a
shade or two darker and so I'm going to
start at the top and you're gonna want
to like invert the hup invert the hump
go like inward and then come down if you
actually went outside the hump you would
actually accentuate it and make it look
bigger than what it is we can actually
give her a nice round button nose at the
end but just like curving it anywhere
that we're shading we are going to try
to make it look smaller we're gonna give
her a nice sheer it has nice straight
nose but it's gonna look a nice thin
skinny nose so to highlight we're
actually just going to take a little bit
right here and we'll go ahead and
highlight the areas that are not
contoured and we're just going to take
our time to softly blend that out
you
also just a tip that I always do is add
a little bit of a highlight to the tip
of the nose and drag it straight up just
for more of a contoured effect and make
the nose look straighter so here is a
before-and-after look at the amazing
difference to me both noses are
absolutely gorgeous one it's just a
little bit more skinny that is it for
