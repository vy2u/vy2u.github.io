video is going to be teaching you how to
get rid of dark circles also I think it
with Maybelline so I'm going to be using
some of their concealers to show you a
couple of different concealer hacks and
maybe show you a couple things you
haven't seen before that you can do with
concealer I know I say the word
concealer weird it's cuz I'm from
Alabama concealer I say with an eye
instead of a ceal ER moment there you
know I just switch things up and make
them my own on my channel but the focus
of today's video is going to be on
different ways that you can cover up the
dark circles I get so many questions
asked how to deal with them
understanding that dark circles are
sometimes hereditary and you don't
really do anything to earn them but they
just come and they're there and they
hang out I will let you know in this
video my dark circles are a little bit
Zim's because of the lighting so bright
in real life right through here they are
a bit darker and when we get closer up
and pull the camera closer hopefully
you'll be able to see that a little bit
better
I guess we'll jump right in the video
and get started and be sure to subscribe
to my channel before you subscribe to my
channel for you and we'll jump right in
to get started alright alright jumping
right into the video my first trick a
really tip I should say in the dark
circle business and the under eye
creasing like the whole moment for the
under eye I say moisturize even if you
only skin you can just leave it to
moisturize in man dry or using a gel
moisturizer because those tend to be
water-based versus the oily cream
moisturizers today I'm going to be using
the tarts h2o moisturizer this is not a
specific eye cream this is actually a
face cream but it's mini sample size
looks so so good also a cool thing you
can do to like help with bags just put
like a little moisturizer in the fridge
and just like that coolness in the
morning will help tame the beast I think
you can see a little bit more of my bags
and darkness I really deal with bag
bagginess honestly a lot of people get
under ice pillar which is the same as
the lip filler they just put it in their
under eye to fill this areas there's no
longer that I did it and their eye which
if you ever look at some
equal and you see just like perfect not
one little slide back I'm not saying
that they all everyone has under I who
has perfect under I pest filler but a
lot of people do I'm personally just not
brave enough to do it also I've heard
bad side effects about it causing your
skin to sag over time I haven't that
wait a filler in the tender skin if your
under-eye and also I'm a chicken
you know I'm just a chicken with these
things so there's absolutely nothing
wrong with doing it I'm just putting
that option out there and letting you
know it is a thing see I'm too scared to
do it so it's not going to happen today
we'll be working with things that are
filler moisturizing going to definitely
help the way the products S on your face
as well it's going to help majorly with
creasing make sure your moisturizer is
completely dried down before you start
applying a product CC so I have quite a
few different hacks on covering the dark
circle so I'm going to start explaining
those to you color correction is one of
them and how kind of color correct look
it up fuzz on my finger robot how color
correction kind of works is these colors
around here or what the dark circles are
made of and if you go straight across it
will show you the correction and your
orange e yellow Selman colors over here
are typically the things that just are
opposite colors and they help blur out
the darkness this is a master camo color
correction kit from Maybelline and it
comes with these different color
correction items as well as some
concealers and a little brush here to
use which I'm actually going to be using
and I'm going to be taking the correct
orange shade to dim down the darkness a
little tip when doing this I don't
really recommend dating your finger in
and like taking on on shade I think
justice feint is the dark colors that's
how much faint orange color you need
reality is I mean just a little bit and
then because you're going to be putting
product on top of this and honestly a
girl we don't want to do too much
product because then we end up with the
creasing and the caking and it not
lasting and it's sloughing away so do
you see like how small amount of product
I use I just get a little on my brush
and I find that that is more than enough
and you know what if your dark circles
are bigger or darker than
mine you can go in with a little bit
more product or even a more aggressively
orange color just kind of plagues we're
all different and we all have different
colors going on in our under eye and
girl we all got to treat it differently
so this is one of my hacks just doing
the color correcting honestly it works
you can already see that my darkness is
faded just a little bit you can do your
finger to whatever works for you just
pat pat pat pat pat so another problem
that's hard to fix is not just the color
of the under eyes the actual dividend of
the sunken in eyes which I have and a
lot of humans do because we're human
being it's okay to have those don't ever
feel bad about them so the sunken in
parts right here I'm looking at my
viewfinder so make sure I'm pointing in
our area it's kind of a trick little
hack that I do where you can kind of
dilute those I'm going to be using a bit
of a thicker product this is the
Maybelline cover stick corrector
concealer and I'm going to be using a
yellow this is yep yellow looks like
this looks like a little lipstick tube
this is a waterproof product and I like
that but you're going to be putting
product on top of this and this really
locks in place and stays while you put
product on top of it so the trick is to
take a lighter a thicker product and
just kind of outline I need to look in a
mirror hello I am literally just going
to outline all right with the darkness
is so if you can tell just looking
straight at me it kind of gives you the
illusion that I'm flat right here and
not sunken in like it literally is
trickery so whenever you're blending out
your actual pencil you don't want to rub
really hard or take your brush and start
doing this really hard you want to take
your brush or blender and just dabs
you're not moving this product around
too much so that leads me to my next
hair now you don't have to do all these
by the way you have to go you can pick
one or two of these or none of these
whatever you want to do I'm going to
actually go in with concealer and I'm
going to do some covering one of my
favorite concealers of all time and
what's funny as a subscriber actually
recommended this to me like two years
ago I think and I was reading my comic
section but it is the instant age rewind
by Maybelline and the
is a super full-coverage concealer and
it just works so beautifully this is a
brand new tube my little spongy ball on
top of mine was way too disgusting to
show you guys on camera so I'm just
going to open this one up anyone is use
this mostly I mean it's just good
feedback on it and just reading up on
this product it says right here that
this is a super punch treatment
concealer featured a micro corrector
applicator to help instantly erase their
circles and fine lines as if I just
didn't say it myself
so let's crank it up well there she
comes so what I'm going to do is just
apply this and another little hack with
concealer you can the reason we do it in
triangular shapes is to highlight the
face because if the light shines down on
your face and naturally shines like and
triangular not in a circular motion so
you're going to want to apply it in a
triangular shape and it kind of gets a
natural fill I like to just as you salt
spongy this out and then I'll take a
dampened Beauty Blender and what I like
to do is Pat my product out like I said
I'm not going to swipe and another thing
that I think helps prevent creasing is
whenever you pop the product out going
like this back and forth back and forth
because I feel like you get it in every
little crevice in the skin even those
little micro crevices underneath your
eye and that way it's like really smooth
and you can keep looking up too if you
want you to really get it in there and
then you're going to go ahead and pop
that out you can see that coverage is
real honest it's real I'm going to make
a g37 brush from morphe and a little bit
of my cover FX setting powder and I'm
going to set my under eye this step is
crucial crucial crucial crucial setting
the NRI definitely is what makes the
concealer laugh it's also going to help
it stop from creasing you definitely
want to look up whenever you're setting
to really get it back and forth and all
those little nooks and crannies in your
under eye and then that way you make
sure and you're setting it really well
one time I didn't set my concealer
honestly this was years ago and I'll
never forget I came home from work and
my mascara had leaked
all down in my concealer and I feel like
it leak down there because it was like
this wet moisture in my eye so it's just
like grabbing any little black dropping
that scare that fell down and it's a
train wreck kind of scarred me for life
and I'll never forget about it I'll just
swipe it away all the excess powder
another little tip and trick that I like
to do because of the setting powder
being so powdery looking and I'm really
not for like the whole like poofy
powdery look I'll take a little bit of
setting spray wet my sponge with the
setting spray and I will just lightly
dab the powder with the setting spray
and I find that dish just really locks
and loads everything and not only that
it gets rid of the powdery look I really
like all that powdery I mean I do what I
don't you know I like it to look a
little bit more like skin luminous and
it does like dry and powdery and I did
add my foundation on the bottom parts of
my face in case you not trying to play
easier now if we will notice the under
eye looks brighter and then it's kind of
not as obvious that did it right there I
mean it's still there physically but I
don't think it's quite as obvious
because we've given the illusion with
switching up the colors and my whole
under eye just looks brighter and more
awake a little fresh-faced going on here
and because we wet it with a little bit
of setting spray I find that it doesn't
look like so much makeup it helps it
really melt into the skin it kind of
looks a little more luminous II than
powdery and gives it more of a natural
feel happening again you don't have to
really use all these tips and tricks and
hacks in one setting like I did today
you can pick one or two of them and kind
of take from that to use these of you

helpful for you I'll have everything I
