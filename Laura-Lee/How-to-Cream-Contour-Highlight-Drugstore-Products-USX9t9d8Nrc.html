and contouring my face always moisturize
my skin before I apply anything so I
normally do a gel moisturizer this is
the Olay fresh effects I got this one at
Walgreens and I'm just going to do a
light layer of this all over my face
dressing your face will allow any
foundation or anything else as you said
on your skin just to set down so much
more flawlessly and just your skin to
take that in more easily this is a
primer I'm going to go in with next this
is the master primed by Maybelline this
is their new primers and this is the
blur and smooth one
I always prime my skin before applying
foundation so this one is white and I'm
basically just going to push this into
the skin and I'm only going to apply it
to places where my pores are just a
little bit more visible this one right
here it feels like lotion it's not
really silicone filling and it's really
nice and smooth so this is my really
only problem area and I'll just do a DAB
on my forehead now I'm going to add the
thinnest possible coat of foundation
this is the Maybelline fit me matte
poreless foundation I am talking super
super thin because we're going to be
using so much more product all over our
face to do the highlighting contour you
won't really be using much foundation
for your coverage
to highlight cocktail my face I'm going
to be using these master conceal
concealers this one is going to be my
contouring one this is medium deep and
then this one is going to be what you
like for me this can be light and this
is obviously going to be my highlighting
one and I'm going to first start with
highlighting my face because these are
like in little tubes I'm just going to
squeegee out some on my finger and warm
it up by warming up the product you get
the product a little bit thinner and way
easier to spread out so what I'm going
to do is with my finger I'm going to
start with applying the highlighter in
places that I want to push out and then
I want light to pick up so first and
foremost we'll go under the eyes you
always want to do it like a triangular
shape because the way light hits down on
your face it's gonna do like a
triangular shape of light so that's
what's going to keep us looking really
natural here
and same thing over here
the next year even a highlight is the
forehead area if you have a really large
forehead go ahead and bring your
highlight down to about right here and
don't go help any higher and then you
can contour the rest of your forehead
and that will give the illusion that
your forehead is much smaller I have
kind of a small poor head I mean I made
a little eye except my hair up but
before that isn't that big they're in my
face so I do a pretty large highlight
and then I'll go ahead and I'll drag
this right on down the nose to give the
appearance of a straight perfect nose
and now I'm going to do right here I
basically cover the whole Cupid's bow
area and then I'm going to do my chin
and I'm going to highlight my jawline
right here you can even connect that
I'm even going to drag some right here
in the nose because I am super chapped
in red right here my nose and this is
going to help to cover that the areas
that you see left is where we're going
to be going in with the deeper concealer
and we're going to do the same thing
we're going to squirt them out in our
fingers we're going to warm it up and
then I just got the synthetic brush here
from 100% pure like that size and that's
what's a really good size brush to do
this with and a synthetic brush so it
really picks up a lot of the product and
doesn't absorb the product so first I'm
going to do the temple area I love doing
my temple area temple area I'm going to
bring it on around like a c-shape and do
those cheekbones
right here this is really going to sink
in our face this is also going to give
us the illusion of having like ginormous
beautiful cheekbones and then I'm just
going to do like the smallest little
stroke right under here you're not
careful it'll give you like a five
o'clock shadow and then do a little bit
right here to give us a nice rounded
chin and then I'm going to drag a little
bit down the nose and bring it all the
way up to underneath my eyebrow
now even going to bring it all the way
around my forehead as you can see I kind
of did a thinner area whereas at this
point if you had a large forehead and
you wanted it to make it look smaller
you would bring it all the way down to
this area right here but my forehead is
kind of sort of small per se so I'm not
going to contour it too much but I love
the way my temples and forehead area
look whenever I get them really bronzed
up but it's time to blend everything out
the longer you let this stuff set in
your face the easier it is to blend out
because it gets really warmed up by your
body temperature and the warmer a
product is the more it just moves around
you do want to move this product around
a little bit as far as blending it out
but you really just want the colors to
stay in the place that you have them
strategically placed on your face so
using a beauty blender and it is damped
per usual I'm going to be blending this
out but I'm mostly going to be doing a
dabbing motion because if you swipe
you're going to move the product away
from an area because we have these
products put in a very strategic place
to do certain things to our face so
let's get started blending
now that I have my highlight pretty much
blended out all the way I'm going to be
taking this 3d kabuki brush from Sigma
as you can see it has like an angle on
it
so it makes it really nice for blending
out this contour and the way I like to
blend out the contour on my cheeks is
I'd like to work it upward and I'm going
in with a light hand with this brush and
basically I'm blending it kind of up
into the cheeks you want everything to
look really gradient you never want to
be able to-- one color starts and one
color stops when everything you should
flow together really nicely blending out
is key whenever contouring high
highlighting your face it's something
that you definitely want to take your
time with
you
you
you
next super important step is to go ahead
and set everything on we'll be using
this translucent setting powder by elf
you can use whatever translucent powder
you have on hand I don't really
recommend using a foundation powder
consent is just way too heavy but any
mattifying or just like a translucent
lightweight mineral powder that you have
on hand go ahead and set your highlight
this is going to prevent a lot of
creasing this is also going to help this
not to slough off during the day it's
going to make it last much much longer
and stay more powerful and not only that
it's going to create this flawless soft
appearance
next to set the bronze I'm going to take
this smaller brush that is quite dense
and when I go in with the wizard I'm
going to go in with this elf mineral
bronzer and I'm just going to tap a
little bit on my brush that cheekbone
area and kind of buff it in
and last but not least I'm going to set
my face without a drugstore setting
spray I'm sorry guys mac fix+ spray is
where it's at so basically my face looks
soaking wet but this stuff dries into
your skin and just locks everything in
and it also enhances all the colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
