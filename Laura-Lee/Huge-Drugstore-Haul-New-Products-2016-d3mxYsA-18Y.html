haul it's good title hey guys welcome to
my channel today's video is going to be
a drugstore haul my videos may seem a
little bit backwards and that is because
I filmed this haul video and then the
footage got to leave it and then I held
your makeup tutorials so basically
you've already seen me use a lot of this
stuff in my drugstore makeup tutorial um
but I'm decided I would go ahead and sum
the haul video because Lauri else and
over a package I want to share with you
a lot of the goodies that were in there
so if I seem redundant I am a sorry
oh but also it's a good thing too

though in their fingerprint in this
video and this just started the first
thing I want to talk about right now is
the wet and wild ombre blush it is such
a gorgeous blush color it is like this
peachy pink that fades into like a happy
highlight I don't know it's so pretty
I'm obsessed with the way these ombre
blush just look this one is called The
Princess Diaries which is a super cute
name and of course they're very
affordable next blush I got from wet and
wild Beauty this is the color icon blush
and mellow wine I just thought it was
the prettiest color blush I don't even
think I have a high-end blush that looks
like this is that color I love it so
much I can't wait to use it and plus
when while blushes are always awesome
blossom so these are gonna be ma same
thing I picked up from Target or the
Vegas thing and our war collaboration
lashes these are my favorite ones out of
the collection actually my all-time
favorite is shining star I've worn these
boobles on my channel and also gland
Grammer
brand glamour are amazing these lashes
look like high-end lashes but
our drugs my lashes and they are very
affordable next one I picked up from the
drugstore these are some of my favorite
feast why peas make it remover wipies
these are the Olay however these are
from sensitive skin because they were
out of my kind that I get that are just
regular never sensitive skins your only
option that's just what you buy but I
mentioned these a bunch of my channel
because I bomb all the time because I go
through and like toilet paper but not
wipe my butt with them or anything but
there's like 20 in a pack I don't know
what am i doing the next thing that I
got is this push-up drama mascara from
Maybelline
actually I subscriber recommended this
to me cuz I always complained that my
lashes grow outward and this is supposed
to help lift the lashes up I tried it
out in this tutorial
it definitely lifted the lashes up the
only thing about it they didn't like is
the fact that I took forever to dry to
add that second coat they got really
clumpy so you're gonna want to let it
dry and then add a second coat you know
what I mean so it just takes a while to
dry I get a little annoying for me but
other than that I do like the mascara
next thing that I got is from Maybelline
which I was very impressed with I use
this in my last makeup tutorial it is
the master prime long-lasting eyeshadow
base now they have different colors that
they come in this one arrow doesn't say
no really doesn't say I don't know this
is the lightest one that they have I do
believe and I loved it I loved it so
much
good stuff right there the next thing I
picked up is by covergirl this is the
true blend minerals loose mineral powder
and I got it in light pill 405 the
reason I bought this guy right here is
because I wanted to use it like I'll use
my Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder kind of to bake the face however
it didn't really work out that great for
me I don't know why I just I just didn't
like it that much
I think I don't know I think that it's
still like really Brown even though it
says light pill it was too Brown so just
like I set my makeup with a um semi make
up with like a foundation powder which
is just too thick to be setting your
makeup with but I clapped I just saw
dust explode for my
and that is gross except something from
Milani that I picked up at CVS this is
the press set go translucent face powder
I haven't tried this out yet so I don't
know what to say about it but it's just
one of those powders to help me stay
matte if you're dealing with oily skin
it does seem very powdery but honestly
most of Milani facial products are
awesome so I can't wait to try this out
I can't imagine it being anything but
fabulous just fabulous
so a few more promise share with you and
then I'm gonna jump into like the boo
qoodles the L'Oreal makeup Oh
next I picked up and NYX ombre blush
which actually the color is so Brown II
it just looks like a gorgeous bronzer
from the drugstore this is new to be
number oh six I like it a lot I think
it's very pretty
and I like this as a highlight shade or
you can mix it together as a shimmery
bronzer the Josiah is lacking on matte
bronzers which we're gonna get into next
I liked weird faces I don't know I think
it's funny
I'm sure if you do too okay and also I
picked up this blush by Milani and
coralina Corley ma I think this is this
is a blush let's talk about all the time
everybody loves it I'm super mad that
L'Oreal pussy stupid stickers that I had
to try like seriously
yeah then I had to get off its like the
stickers because people still makeup
stop stealing makeup come on don't do
that they had to put it on there and now
my packaging ugly but yeah funny story I
got home with this and I have this drive
drugstore makeup that's just all for
joke so makeup cuz that way whenever I
do is your so I make it or I can just go
to that drawer and just get those items
out that I mean well I already had the
blush so I have a duplicate next time
that picked up is from L'Oreal is one of
their infallible pigments which these
are like the best I own like five or six
of these are ready I love buying them I
used to go to Target and whenever they
would go on clearance I would scoop them
up because I think I'm like eight
dollars a piece which is getting close
to a MAC eyeshadow hello rude this one
is in eternal sunshine and it's just a
pretty golden color I'm really hurt to
do a tutorial with it so maybe I'll
incorporate it in a
coming up last Adam before we jump into
the lore'l madness is a color molten by
Maybelline now I am super super
interested in this product and let me
tell you why it reminds me so much of if
I'm looking over theirs cuz I'm looking
at my monitor and I want to make sure
I'm in focus they remind me so much of
the color pop eyeshadows is like a cream
eyeshadow like if you do this your
fingerprints do you see that fingerprint
in it so if you go I'm saying it's a
creamy eyeshadow but with that being
said it is extremely pigmented I cannot
wait to use this guy out it looks like
it's been used so much honestly is
because I keep putting my fingers with
it like I literally sat here before I
filmed and I was just saying hmm like
rubbing back and forth in it it's all
over my hand I don't know I can't get
enough I'm probably gonna go back and
buy more of these because it was just
really fun to play with okay something
that I'm sure you guys have heard about
on youtubes I feel like I've seen look
like you can see that I've seen these
I've seen videos on these or something
like I've seen these on people's
thumbnails but these are the infallible
Pro matte lip glosses I cannot wait to
try these out I haven't tried about yet
but I love the colors they sent me this
video isn't sponsored by L'Oreal by the
way they're just a little PR package to
a bunch of bunch of blockers and I got
lucky enough to get one so thanks
L'Oreal but um yeah these look amazing I
cannot wait try them I'll do close-up
swatches so you guys can see the colors
I'm really glad the drugstore is finally
coming out with the matte lippy because
as we know that it's just like the thing
right now which I pretty much only wear
matte lippies so now that we have them
at the drugstore it's way more
affordable next up is the infallible Pro
contour very exciting stuff coming out
of the drugstore I'm glad they're coming
out with contour stuff because it's just
like slim pickings you have to spend an
arm and a leg for a contour set unless
you'd go with makeup geek or morphe or
something like that
but being able to access it really
easily at the drugstore is super
convenient so this is the light one
which i think is going to be the one for
me it comes with this weird shaped brush
obviously to use like that I will be
using this guy um I just think that's
too gimmicky from me I'll personally
just use one of my own brushes but I
really love love
love this I love that they had the
banana color to highlight with I loved
it they have that cool tone matte shade
to highlight our to contour with they
really thought it through on this one
so good job Laurie oh and I also got it
in a darker shade which I think it's
gonna be too dark for me this one is
medium I think the light next up from
the drugstore by L'Oreal is the brow
stylist prep and shaped pro kit I think
that these are like the cutest thing
ever
they come with the tiniest little brush
in Paris tweezers ever and then it comes
with like a color wax as well as your
brow product to kind of mix it you like
to see the side of my face right there
is so weird that you can mix together
and kind of make your own brow pomade
the shades that I got men are light to
medium and medium to dark I'll probably
try light to medium because I've been
trying not to go so dark on my eyebrows
lately but they always just end up
really dark tip from L'Oreal I'm just
gonna have to do like a picture of
review of these because they sent me 15
of their new eyeshadows these are just
color rich eyeshadows I will show you my
favorite color which is number 207 this
one just looks so pretty it's a nice
shimmery color except I got a mascara
from L'Oreal this is the volumous
superstar red carpet black that is a lot
going on but it's a double-ended wand
mascara I remember when I was in high
school there was this double into one
mascara oh it's like a primer and a
mascara I used to love love at least
whenever I never wore false lashes in
high school there was one that I
remember I would like use it until it
was like bone dry I was like addicted to
I think is Maybelline in a purple tube
then I got sent the metallic mmm wait
manic
matte I'm just making up things matte
manic infallible eyeliners I get a great
a black and a navy and I can't wait to
try this out as well I'm always looking
for good options for the waterline and
to top line with so hopefully these will
be really creamy and nice to work with
and then lastly got the infallible black
velvet liquid liner by L'Oreal and it is
oh my god and I expect that whatsoever
big felt-tip whoa oh my gosh it's like
really black - okay
okay at first I was gonna be like man I
won't use Excel use pens but listen I'm
interested I don't know I'll be trying
that out but again that is the
infallible black velvet liquid liner and
shade black noir but I said for this
video guys i just talked my head off and
cottonmouth um that's it i love you guys
thank you guys so much for being here
and watching and i hope to see you all
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
