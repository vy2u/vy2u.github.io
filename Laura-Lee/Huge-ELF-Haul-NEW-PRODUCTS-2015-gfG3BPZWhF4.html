video is going to be a very exciting
video because I'm like yelling and it's
really annoying and I need a stop do you
start over oh my god
today's video is gonna be pretty legit
it's gonna be a massive alcohol I did
get a huge package from ELF with so many
amazing new goodies in it that I
absolutely cannot wait to share with you
guys and I asked you guys on Instagram
do you want to see a halt and somebody a
lot of you guys said yes but some of you
guys probably do some reviews so what I
thought I would do in this video is kind
of like haul it and first impressions it
as I go to give you guys my thoughts on
it yada yada yada the video gets a
little bit long I'm sorry about that but
just know that that's what I'm trying to
accomplish here you guys notice there's
like a massive CRO outside if I cat is
about to like busting my window to kill
it
and if you guys notice my lovely wedding
ring I did get married in San Diego I'm
gonna have a vlog up on it on my vlog
Channel um to tell you guys more about
that so I'm a married woman
anyway is enough jibber-jabber we're
gonna jump right in and we're gonna dig
in this wonderful box of elf products
first thing honestly I want to talk to
you guys about Hell air so this is there
oh my god video brush set and I'm really
excited about it and I want to go ahead
and tell you guys my experience with elf
brushes the ones with a black handle
which I think cost like $1 more than the
ones with the white handles white handle
fast longer the ones with the white
handle are still really good soft
brushes they're great for blending I
love them but whatever you wash them the
glue loosens up and you loose bristles
quick I've had a lot of these fall apart
but these normally cost you about a
dollar so it's nothing heartbreaking
okay you're not gonna cry over it but
these right here are still very
affordable and they hang in there I love
the black handle brushes so whenever I
saw this I squealed favorite brush and
this kid is this little fan brush right
here I've been looking for an affordable
one of these everywhere because I want
to spend a lot of money on a fan brush
you know so I'm going to be highlighting
my face with this and tutorials now and
then separately I got the ultimate
kabuki brush which I'm pretty excited
about I think it's a little bit big to
contour your face with because I like to
be really precise whenever I'm
contouring my face that's how you get
that chiseled look you want to be really
strategic when placing bronzer on your
face whenever you're trying to contour
not just bronze up your face this would
be great for just bronzing up the face
even adding a little bit of blush think
of like a mustache or something I'd say
this would be cute sitting out on the
vanity I got a bunch of pieces from
their new skincare line and I want to
talk about the packaging first really L
they have like you've amped it up this
stuff looks like something really high
in it Sephora love the packaging looks
really clean and it looks really nice
and expensive the only thing I've
already tried on my skin I took this on
vacay with me it's the Norse noshing the
nourishing night cream Laura you know
you should try to pronounce words I
think we all have a common ground where
we know I just kind of say things
however I want to on this channel so
it's the nourishing night cream and it
is a little bit thin for night cream
which I actually adore that for the
summer time because if I use a heavy
night cream in the summer time I start
dealing with a lot of clogged pores but
then whenever I go to a job oyster Iser
just not enough so I feel like this is a
great in-between night cream um
especially for summer in springtime you
know when all the grease is starting to
come out of your face lid does mine does
it smell like anything it's like
sim-free
and I like that because in my opinion I
feel like that's less chemicals putting
it on your face here's the daily
moisture Hydra and I haven't even scared
me a little
this one has like a teeny tiny scent to
it smells very clean
I don't know I'm showing you like look
at my moisturize hand I actually think
I'm gonna love this too this is not I
don't know like this is gel base there's
no from it there's probably information
on the box
cos hand it throw them away but this one
isn't I wouldn't call it gel base
because it feels a little bit thicker
than a gel which is weird because the
cream feels a little bit thinner than a
cream I don't know but this seems like
it would be a good good good daily
moisturizer and then we got some
smoothing serum for your face if you
remember L'Oreal came out with one in
the pink bottle which was a smoothing
serum so I guess this is supposed to be
something like that I don't know if it
works obviously because I mean I haven't
tried it but um it is very very thin
serum if you can see it kind of looks
watery it doesn't feel all like or
anything like that like it would clog
your pores but I'm actually gonna start
trying this out because I've been
looking for a good serum to put on my
face um so I want to try this out you
know see what it does for me I'm gonna
smooth something out this is the
illuminating eye cream and I'm a sucker
for trying out new eye cream oh goodness
gracious
honestly the eye cream actually isn't
that thick of an eye cream it kind of
feels almost just like the face cream
and it doesn't smell like anything it's
just like the face cream and I want to
talk to you guys about this little brush
that came in here is called the blending
brush Megan is a black handled it didn't
come in the kit it is so incredibly soft
it feels like a high-end kabuki brush
and what I'm thinking because it's it's
kind of flat as you can see is to put a
little bronzer on one side of those oh
yeah honey chill out that cheekbone oh
my god I'm so excited about this please
let me know down below if you guys want
me to do a
you of their foundation serum I want to
do a review really bad on this for some
reason we'll let you guys know that it
doesn't come in very many shades
whatsoever but I got shade medium and it
is very liquidy oh but the colors pretty
but it's very thin and very liquidy so
I'm really curious like how this
goodness into my face is it I just get
it on my white shirt weren't so I'm
really curious like how it's gonna set
my face like what its gonna do to me is
gonna make me crazy it's gonna make me
dry what's gonna happen so let me know
you want me to review I haven't tried it
out yet or anything alone alright so
this is another product I pretty much
been dying to try like Laura why don't
you just come by it's like three or four
two-horse does the elf mineral infused
facial primer and I wanted to see how it
compares to the hourglass veil mineral
primer because they look very similar
and elf has been doing a good job and
creating dupes of products oh it's
completely different okay so this well
now we know but this is actually clear
silicone based and it rubs in really
good hmm
definitely not what I expected so it
comes like in a white bottle but the
products actually clear yeah oh it says
clear on the bottom doctor I get two of
their like cream blushes the first one
is rosy royalty the second one is peach
perfection i tried their cream blushes
before and i like them a lot
buts watching this one on my hand i feel
like i like these a little bit better
because whenever you get into like cream
blushes you don't want it to be too too
pigmented because then you will look
like a little cracker i would like let's
say you got like slapped in the face a
little bit like a cream blushes pigment
to be a little bit more subtle and that
is what these are also with the cream
blush i don't like them to feel heavy
because i mean we already have so much
on our face these cream blushes they
feel really lightweight they kind of
form out into a powder well that's what
like i'm getting off of these by
swatching them they kind of like rub off
into a powder and they're very subtle
the color payoff I don't know which one
I like better honestly because I really
like wearing pinks and peaches so it's
kind
like Hello they know me too well okay so
this is their mascara defining mascara
it comes in this little silver tube oh
my God look at the wand these are two
different things I didn't think that
this was the same thing like tricked me
kind of scared me a little I was like oh
my god what happened to the one so I
think this is going to be kind of like
the cosmetics tightline where you're
able to get up in there in the base of
the lashes I'm just gonna get stuck in
my claw fake eyelashes then I got in
buff black there Tapani mascara so
obviously this one is the real mascara
oh yeah and so this is the one of those
um and looks like has fibers in it weird
it comes with like the plastic one
instead of a bristly one but the plastic
one is really bristly this is their
baked highlighter and I've used their
baked products before and then come off
really pretty but the problem with my
fine with them is they don't last very
long
but I mean I haven't drawn them in like
two years so they could be different oh
my god it's beautiful
I don't know how long it's gonna last
but jeez Louise that is an absolute like
can you sing it hello huh do you guys
see you in a pirate about here okay oh I
am just breathtaking comes up really
light and bright definitely has that
pearly finish to it and if you guys want
an affordable highlight I mean I don't
know how long it's gonna last but my god
it is a beautiful oh my god like it's
not coming out like not having it I've
never tried their baked highlighter and
that was like my try with that and I
kind of loved it but I did the baked
item they've tried with the baked
eyeshadows and that's what I had a
little bit more of a problem with so I
got a gold can't hold on to things today
got like a rose gold a bronze a really
deep dark brown one and then like a
regular gold one eyeshadow I'm just
gonna swatch to kind of see my thoughts
on them but even with the primer last
time they just weren't they weren't
lasting and they kind of sort of weren't
staying in place like I wanted them to
but they may have changed the formula I
going to use these eventually I'm going
to see my thoughts on them because
they're coming off way more pigmented
than I remember them coming off
literally I'm a ten year old right now
but just get a few more their black
bristled uh black bristled black handled
black brushes huh so amazing and then I
got a white bun I then I got a whole
bunch of their moisturizing lipsticks
and I did an L Paul long time ago our
bought a lot of these and I really liked
them and just gonna go ahead and let you
guys know that a lot of times whenever
you deal with a moisturizing lipstick
that's really soft and creamy you don't
get quite the color payoff oh my gosh I
like extremely extremely creamy but you
get the color payoff of something that
it's like a matte or liquid lipstick
like you get a stream color payoff with
these then I go I mean really is this a
joke highly recommend these to you guys
especially a lot of people have asked me
you know how do I build a makeup
collection because that's the makeup
peeps we want options and the way to
have options is to you know build up
your collection have a few different
items so a good affordable way to have
options is I mean L hello especially
with your lipsticks like these are just
Holy Grail to die for lipsticks so check
them out and Elvis sold it one more on
target guys
lastly got these matte lip colors okay
this is a product that I've never tried
for them so I can't say but yeah I can't
say that I love any kind of matte
lipstick even though I have horribly dry
lips I just love them can't get enough
of them I can't wait to try these oh my
god I get so many colors to look how
many colors they come in O so it comes
like a pencil they remind me a lot it
probably a dupe for the lorac mad at lip
pencils they look the exact same
packaging the pencils look the exact
same oh my god the color payoff is just
amazing I'm gonna swatch all these for
you guys let you guys see like a
close-up of it get your own opinion
album um but oh my god they're beautiful
one of them does it have a name though
Oh No
okay so this red maroon one does it have
a sticker on the back so it doesn't have
a name so I'm not gonna be able to tell
you the neck I'll look it up so I'm
definitely gonna be trying out these
products more when you play with them
you'll see
coming up in some tutorials hope you
