amazing and so whenever I met her you

like gosh I hope there's a cool as I
hope they are and she was so cool she
was so kind down-to-earth like I was
asked her question about our line and it
wasn't like a scripted answer it was
more like just chitchat answer like her
line is beautiful nail polishes I'm
going to show it with you there's a lot
more stops on the star-studded September

you also Beauty for inviting me on these
cool adventures with you guys I think
it's so amazing celebrities are gonna be

crazy so I'm really excited all right
you guys ready to see what this time I
also do tea bag let's jump in the hall
cuz I got a lot of stuff okay jumping
right in the first thing I bought
sweet like candy by ariana grande love
her first perfume re of course I bought
that one and actually me my sister were
obsessed with it so we were like okay
let's just buy the rollerball and then
we got really obsessed with it so then
we went in for the big size one and so
whenever she came out would see like
candy I was like I'm not messing around
I'm just getting the big guy I mean this
packaging is just so cute it's like the
other ones like re but the bottle is all
matte pink it has the pink little it
smells just like candy to me gotta get
it going hmmm I love it next thing I got
actually a tarp sent this to me but this
is an exclusive item peralta so I really
want to talk about it because I've
actually been using it and I really like
it this is the stall by Haru Sh palek
the perfume is getting in my throat oh
my lord
alright so this is the style Baja Rouge
palette that she created with tart I
love the palette I think it's so awesome
and honestly whenever I looked at it I
was kind of like um kind of a blushy
neutral palette not much to it but then
I started using it I really fell in love
with the palette like I liked it a lot
especially bliss and royal who such a
good palette that perfume is just
sneaking up all into my nostrils it's
strong guys don't go in heavy with it it
is strong I'm having trouble breathing
yeah alright I'm back this is like
larlie blush right here like my favorite
blush is a matte peach or even a
shimmery peach but like when I felt this
blush else like yeah so it comes with
six eyeshadows and a blush and the
palette should look pretty thing I
picked up just because I'll be traveling
a lot I'm going to Belize in Paris and
New York and God knows all over Miami
Alabama I'm going I'm gonna be places
people so I picked up a mini pace wash
no one had to carry my big one with me
this is my purity and if you have any
type of skin this is good for it's just
such a gentle easygoing face wash it's
not specifically for moisture or for
acne
it's just a good all-around cleanser
that really gets in there takes all your
makeup off oh and by the way whenever I
bought Ahri they gave me a free gift of
versace bright crystal I haven't had a
Versace perfume before I don't think
ever so that's cute
so bright crystal it smells really good
but it's not strong it's not like I like
strong sweet candy floral stuff but this
is like really easygoing gentle smelling
more like a daytime perfume versus a
night tempura is that a thing daytime
nighttime I'm making up stuff but this
is a light perfume but it smells really
good all right next up I had to pick up
one of my brow pencils because I was
almost out of a benefit brow pencils
I've gone through this will be my fourth
one what what is that on my page I don't
even know what that was that's probably
my paste the whole video I don't know I
have a lot of sparse areas and I have
been loving this and by the way I am
Number Four number four not number two
three or five I am Number Four in the
brow pencil the next thing I picked up
is by Fiona Styles this is the loose
invisible setting powder so I don't know
a lot about her like I don't know Piana
Saul story but why do knows her
packaging is joke all her packaging has
like this dent and then I don't know I
think it's really cool and I'm addicted
to my alarm or see a loose translucent
setting powder and I use it every single
day no matter what it is a Holy Grail
product of mine but at the same time
just being in the beauty community and
being a blogger it's like I want to find
another I know the are MCA or whatever
setting powder is just as good but I
want to find something different out
there that's just as good so I'm trying
out different setting powders guys and
we'll see what I find out there but this
is a loose one and it's not supposed to
be like really translucent where it's
gonna like flash back on you it actually
has a little bit of pigment to it so I
think I'm going to give this one a good
try and I'll tell you guys like is it
just as good and let me tell you what I
pay for it so you'll know so this one
was $26 which is a bit less than the
Laura Mercier one so maybe it'll work
out it could be horrible it could be
great I don't know I'm gonna test out
I'll let you know and keep you posted
I want to go through the OPI nail
polishes this one is we are the female
which I love
like a pretty cranberry color this one
is freedom of peach pun intended
this one is live in the gray I love
green nail polishes I might paint my
claws this color next I don't know we'll
see this one is yellow it's called never
a doulas Gulas moment I'm not catching
with the pun is with this one because
I'm missing something someone will tell
me in the comments this one is called
inside the Isabel way it's a pretty
light sand color this one is called CIA
it's like a deeper blue color and it
stands for color is awesome cute this
one is literally called shits top secret
so this one is like a hunter green color
and I really like it because it's like
an original nail polish color and this
one's called Suzy the first lady of
nails this nudey pink color who is
called pill to the chief' then we have
this pretty purpley color it's called
Carrie blossom so cute this one is so
cute it's called squeaker of the house I
don't know OPI always has the best names
for their polishes then we have a pinky
red color and it's called OPI by popular
vote and then we have a bright pink
color it's called Madame president and
that is the nail polishes for the Kerry
Washington DC set and they are so pretty
I love them they also have like the mini
sets for sale
I love OPI I'm about to go change this
nail polish color Rochon now and yeah so
and then I got the NYX born to go
ruminating primer so this is a primer
base by NYX and let's see what's
happening in the song oh so it looks
like this in the white packaging and
who-so rubbing it out it looks very
luminizing which it feels kind of thick
too like it's a good quality not like a
thin runny primer and then once I rub it
out pretty good it is pretty like my
hand looks a little glowy so it's
definitely luminizing I'm going to test
this out it seems like it would be
pretty good it's almost a heavy texture
but almost in the way that it's a nice
product versus a cheapy product so I'm
excited I'm going to test this out and
then I picked up another highlighter I
love the laura geller baked highlighters
they're some of my favorite gilded honey
is my favorite one but I picked up
ballerina which realizing later that I
already have ballerina but I picked it
up so way more subtle than Gilda honey
but it's like a pinky very pretty
highlight color this wouldn't be like a
go-to highlight for me because it's not
wham bam thank you ma'am enough but it
is definitely one for my rare and subtle
days in makeup and I think this one
would be really beautiful on a light
skin tone it's just not gonna show up
dramatically on me as much as I hoped it
would but I still think it is a really
pretty highlight I'm gonna be trying it
out so that is it for this Ulta haul
thank you guys so much for coming on my
channel and watching also keep an eye
out for me on snapchat and Instagram and
Twitter and YouTube for more
star-studded September with Ulta who am
