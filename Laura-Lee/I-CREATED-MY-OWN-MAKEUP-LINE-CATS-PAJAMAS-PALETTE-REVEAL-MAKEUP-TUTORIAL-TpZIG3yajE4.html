I'm so excited to be filming this video
the heck it stop smiling it's nothing
short of a miracle that I don't have a
purple lipstick on my teeth my nose
itches I've like a nervous habit I like
in my mind telling myself that in time I
knows it's just when it really doesn't
so if you notice in every video I ever
do I always hit my nose itches it's a
nervous habit in my head it's gonna
happen bad in this video because I get
too exposed to you my eyeshadow palette
there's just not words to explain how I
feel because I feel so many emotions
right now I can't believe that we're
here already although I've been working
on this for so freakin long I created my
own makeup brand and I started this a
long time ago me my husband created it
and the brand is called largely Los
Angeles and I've kept it a secret for so
long and my closest friends obviously
knew I was working on it but I made it
for you guys and this is the moment that
I get to tell the people that I made
this product for or in this line for
what I made it's really nerve-racking
I'm real nervous I'm just nervous about
everything I'm one human being and me
and I created this by ourselves we don't
have investors or head honchos or bosses
at tools what to do I'm so proud of us
for what we've accomplished we saved our
money and put everything aside sorry I'm
getting like whimpering voice I knew
this was gonna happen in this video at
law you're gonna dry it up it's a happy
moment ah and I remember about my lived
on Bama so in love with makeup and of
course people that would you ever show
you don't makeup lied just because I was
so in love with it and I oh I saw that
that dream here we go with the voice
thing I always always always hope that
that dream was way too big so I was
always like I may be only a makeup
artists but that likes our makeup line
cuz that's just too big of a dream and
I'm almost mad at myself for thinking
that way because no dreams too big if
you work hard enough no dream is truly
too big so with this video I want to
leave you with that message and we've
been doing a huge countdown on snapchat
and all over social media for the reveal
and the reveal is already on my
Instagram if you saw that you got a
little spoiler but let me sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and then we'll jump in to
this video subscribe
let's go ahead and kick this thing off
well here she is
oh my god much dropped it I can't get it
together here she is
Shh no this is it this is a pallet this
is what has actually been consuming my
life for almost two years now what's
interesting is I actually started
creating this whenever I wasn't ready to
cram makeup line I had like all these
boards and everything of like what I
wanted this to be and so I actually
started creating the palette and then
whenever it came time for me to like get
the ball rolling and just start talking
to labs and making dreams come true I
was really prepared and I also feel like
collaborating with other brands had two
collaborations I did my palette with
violet Voss which made me fall in love
with creating ishow palette so think
about it watch for the opportunity it
truly just made me fall in love with the
creation of Asha palettes and really
getting that experience behind my back
really helped me create my own makeup
line as well as working with Mac and
truly creating my own lipstick I have a
lot more stuff coming with my brand this
is just the first product mind you we
are working on spring next year we're
working on so much stuff guys so like if
I didn't get to do those collapse I
don't know if this palette would be as
good as it is cuz it's really freakin
good I decided to come up with the
eyeshadow palette because it's truly
creating that I should have a hollow
ball balls like I fell in love with the
creation of eyeshadow palettes and I
love eyeshadows are probably my favorite
piece of makeup I do this tutorial too
if you guys want to know how I get this
look keep watching the video so this is
the palette and I wanted it to come out
with a bang I want it glitz
Limor and let me tell you whenever you
get this palette the first thing you
need to do is turn your flash on your
phone lay it down and just hit it with
the flash it looks unreal my lights are
soft that I film with so it's not doing
it the justice that wish it would but
you can tell like the whole bit is
glitter I love it so let's go ahead and
open her up so let's open her up this is
her she is a 10 panned palette she has
four shimmers she has 5 matte and then
this one right here out the other is a
semi matte color so it's a matte but it
has like the slightest bit of shimmer in
it so it's a little bit of a hybrid
eyeshadow color and that's why I say
there are five mattes and for shimmers
and then one like this and a matte
really cool color now the colors on the
bottom may look a little bit similar to
each other but I will swatch and show
you just how different they are as well
as some are shimmer and some are met I
picked every color and created every
color in this palette anyways this is my
logo yeah we created my logo has a lot
of you have already seen it because my
merch they came out falls under the same
logo the palette will be for sale on
larlie Los Angeles com same website
where you bought the merch though my
website I own it it launches October
13th Friday the 13th oh my god hatsan
Friday the 13th that just couldn't
worked out better I will have the time
that's gonna launch in the description
box down below but I will be posting all
the information about this palette on
the Instagram page at Laura Lee Los
Angeles that's the Instagram page and
this is the profile picture it's my look
I will just be honest and tell you guys
like the creation of this palette wasn't
perfect it wasn't a dream it was really
hard it was a lot of tears and he really
ain't getting all sappy it was a lot of
stress it put a lot of stress on me and
Ty it was hard it was really really hard
it's hard to come out the makeup line
there's so many ins and outs that you
don't know about and I had a switch labs
I had to go through hoops to get the
perfect formula which we're going to
talk about in a minute I was persistent
I'm sure everybody in this industry who
works in creating makeup is annoyed with
me because I'm like no it's got to be
the best if people that love me that
follow me that choose to spend their
money on something I created we will not
disappoint it will be the absolute best
and that is what I truly believe in and
that is what I create so let's get into
the shadows and the formulas and talk a
little bit about the eye shows and why I
created each color when you open the
palette you're gonna get a little flimsy
piece of plastic that is to protect the
eyeshadows from the mirror I always took
these for granite and threw them in the
trash immediately and they got on my
nerves and they were in pallets and now
if you're ordering an F load of pallets
for everybody to have one these end up
costing a lot of money and these are
special and I also picked out a really
nice fancy thick ones so that way I
subscriber actually give me a tip you
have your mixing foundations and stuff
you can mix it on this cart you don't
have to toss it because it's very nice
every detail counted let me tell you a
little bit about my Strato formula so
you are more aware and knowledgeable on
it's my shadow formula is one of the
easiest shadow formulas to blend that is
one of the things that was most
or it to me and I wanted people to be
able to use this palette that our
beginners and the pros are gonna have
absolutely no problem with this palette
but it's the beginners I wanted the
everyday woman to be able to buy this
palette and have absolutely no trouble
blending it I say women and I mean
everyone I mean girls and guys obviously
you know I love my man and makeup and I
don't want it to scare people I didn't
want people to have a hard time using
the colors I wanted it to be the easiest
most blendable formula but at the same
time I wanted it to have maximum
pigmentation so you're getting both I'm
going to show you in the tutorial just
how great these colors are the payoff
and the blend ability it's just unreal
alright so we'll talk about the shadow
names as well I made this palette to
resemble me but also along my journey in
YouTube he's being teary eyed again
she's gonna stop just give me a minute
so the shedder names came from the
comment section they came from people
who relate it to me and not being normal
feeling a little bit like an oddball
like a weirdo like a scatterbrain just
feeling a little different from everyone
else they're a little off and that is
okay and that's what makes us also so
special and it took me a really long
time a long time to be authentically
myself even when I started my channel I
don't feel like I was fully
authentically myself and I finally had
to cast aside all the comments people
tell me I'm annoying I'm too much I have
too much ATD I'm all over the place they
can't say my channel I had to fight
through them push aside those comments
and just be authentically me and
realized that people who love me from me
are gonna stay and the rest can leave
because baby ain't changing for anyone
and I feel like I really made the shadow
names before those people and you'll get
them as I tell you also gimmicky I
subscribe is not a shadow name because
this palette I wasn't even a thing on my
channel whenever this was in creation so
that couldn't have happened but we have
those names for the future right guys so
let's go ahead and start
I have swatches and all ready for you
guys first we have okey-dokey now this
is a cream bone shade I have to have the
shade always to start my makeup look and
I really wanted to create a palette
where you can create many full complete
looks without having to reach for
another palette so this color you can
use to create a cut crease you use to
blend out your art to soften up your
eyeshadow primer you can use it for your
brow bone you can use this color for so
many uses next we have scatterbrain
which is a very very shimmery golden
color it's what I have on my eyelid
right now oh it's so pretty this is a
very soft gold color it's very easy to
wear it doesn't have that big of a punch
it's almost just like a soft shimmery
color this is also a beautiful Bridal
color
it's a beautiful prom color it's a
beautiful everyday color as well because
it's very subtle but it's very shimmery
and has like that pop it really makes
your eyes go I named it a scatterbrain
because I am literally a scatterbrain
I'm all over the place and I've come to
realize I don't want to fix that that's
who I am and I want to say that way I
want to be a scatterbrain if that's who
I'm meant to be then that's who I'm
gonna be next we have bomb diggity disco
bomb diggity because this is one of the
best colors to me for a transition shade
it's the mustardy brown and yellow a
brown undertone color I love it I think
it looks beautiful on all skin tones
it's just not the normal typical
transition shade that we have in all
fifty thousand pallets it is something
different and you can also blend it out
on the upper area up here outside of
transition and really get that yellowy
cool color that's not just plain brown
so you can use it a couple different
ways next we have cray cray again
describing Who I am I am cray cray girl
she cry
cray-cray is a caramel e warm
roasty-toasty autumn brown color if you
go in really light hand it with cray
cray it stays this soft orange e color
if you start to punch it in and really
Pat it on and build it up on I it can
get really deep so you can get a really
nice deeper brown color with Craig rice
next we have redonkulous love that name
redonkulous is our bronzy brown but i
wanted it not to be too deep bronzy
brown because i really want it to pop i
wanted to show up and just be like I'm
Flossie I'm here I see you I love the
glitz I love the glamour so redonkulous
is also extremely pigmented use a little
light hand you can also apply these with
a synthetic flat brush or you can use it
with your finger it is an amazing
shimmer next is quirky I have been
called quirky my whole entire life I've
also been called kooky which is the next
shade so we have quirky I love the color
shimmery purple I love shimmery purples
and that's exactly what this is it's not
a scary shimmery purple though it's a
very very very wearable
shimmery purple it is beautiful with
every eye color as well because it's not
a neon purple it's not too vibrant it
won't scare you to apply it it's very
subtle and a little bit of a deeper
purple color but yet still has that
shimmery pop to it next we have kooky so
kooky is a color I want in this palette
but I had a tweed cooky a lot because I
want it cookie and getting to be very
wearable I know not everybody likes to
put bright red cream berries on their
eyes so I added a lot of a deeper brown
shade to kooky so it's very wearable and
it comes off soft it's not like intense
red it is so easy to work with it's one
of my favorite colors I love to blow it
out everywhere and go crazy with it but
you can just put a little on the inner
corner on the lower lash line and it has
that brown undertone so it still it's a
little more natural than like a crazy
bright cranberry next we have in one ear
this is the most insane color and the
palette if you swatch it go ahead and
don't don't do some justice don't go
this way just take it all the way up the
arm like I like to do with it because I
like this color to have the justice that
it deserves it is insanely pigmented
like it will blow you away and in one
ear and goes great with cookie you can
wear them together you can wear all
these colors together I'm gonna do
multiple tutorials and show you guys how
to wear home and if you put this color
on it is a little bit of a lighter
primary color but if you add layers of
it and build it up it becomes a little
bit of a darker more subtle cranberry
color so next we have this interesting
shade called out the other but I don't
know if you guys got that one in the ear
in one ear out the other
get it they go together helped so in one
ear right here so this color looks a
little bit similar to porky but i
swatched them right next to each other
so you can really see what a big
difference they truly are and what ear
is a semi-matte so it's not fully matte
it has a little bit of sparkle a little
bit of glimmer to it but it's not a full
shimmer either it's almost a satin with
like a little bit of matte to it and a
little bit of sparkle so it's like this
hybrid color with all kinds of things
going on very pigmented definitely if
you tap your blending brush in it please
please please go lightly on this color
is a purpley color but it has a big-time
brown undertone with it so honestly once
you really really really blend this all
over your eye you would have more of a
brown eye shadow with a slight purple
undertone to it and you'll really see
that whenever you start working with
this color lastly we have oddball oh my
god how can you
how without a beautiful matte black I
love oddball I use oddball every single
day to cover up my gray roots okay I
have oddball and one of my older used
pallets and almost hit pan on it because
I was using it so much every day
it isn't extremely let me tell you
something about oddball let me explain
oddball to you I know you just see a
black eyeshadow but I know things cuz I
created it it's very pigmented but it
doesn't have a lot of kick back so that
way it's easier to use it's not gonna
explode everywhere you're not gonna have
a matte black explosion matte box are
hard
you either have on where no you get no
payoff with them or you have it where
when you tap your brush in it you
literally have so much of black on your
brush it just explodes all over your eye
and they're really hard to work with so
this one if you tap a little bit on your
brush you're good to go it's not gonna
explode over your eye you just get a
little bit of color you can blend it and
then you can really build it up with
this color that is what I create it with
oddball the color name is oddball
because well she's not ball and so it
also has a little bit of sparkle in it
as you can see like very faint it truly
if you can see I have eyeball on it
really doesn't show up on the eye it's
just really beautiful in the palette so
don't let the sparkle scare you it's
awesome and that is the colors of the
palette oh my gosh I just explained
everything so let's talk a little bit
about the packaging we have the silver
glitter and if you look at the top it
has a little kitten running across it
it's just a little my new detail that I
thought was really special to add in it
says cats pajamas right there and after
you see the beautiful rose flowers all
around the palette we have the die cut
mirror which I thought was a beautiful
detail the inside is definitely if you
can see this palette is it's not all
over the place but it definitely is his
own palette it's glitter and it's my
logo and it's cast and it's flowers it's
all that I am put into a palette and I'm
all over the place as a person I know
something you may feel that way too you
may feel like you're trying to do a
hundred things at once Oh your brain
runs a 90 miles now or that you're all
over the place and that's just who you
are and that is kind of what I wanted to
represent with a palette and I think
overall it came out so unreal and so
beautiful now I just want to show you
how this is not private-label branding
so first we have I wanted to do with
glitter palette and so I got multiple
multiple multiple samples of glitter
together and to create the
that I want it I also got samples of
glitter put on the pallet this one's
really scratchy and it feels so rough I
hate it the pallet that we have it's
very slick that has that extra pop so
then I got a glitter that was smooth but
it was such a dull glitter I was like if
you don't give this the hell up out of
here right now we do not deal with don't
glitters no it's just not a part of the
Laura Lee Los Angeles family okay so
once we get the glitter down me and I
actually put on the palette how we
wanted the palette to be and we got the
glitter down so really yes your shadows
we finally finally finally found the
right glitter thank God
litters are hard so then we printed out
my logo and my font that I want it and
literally put it on here a paper to like
create visual oh she's so sad and
pitiful so these shadows ours
it's just so funny looking at it I used
this freaking palette day in and day out
forever and no one knew about it I was
so sad lonely using it but I loved it so
much so that was like kind of a step in
the creation of the palette and I just
wanted to like show you guys some
behind-the-scenes moments and also we
ain't get to talk about the you know
carton really quick this is the you know
carton that your palette will come into
when you get it it will be in this box
this is what it looks like it has like
some like very shine to it and it is the
actual flowers that are inside the
palette so everything correlates and
then the silver larlie Los Angeles logo
all your information about it on the
back the palette is made in the United
States yeah remember October 13 so that
is my rundown on cat's pajamas I hope
you guys took an understanding of what
this pound means to me and I hope you
guys love it as much as I've been loving
it I've been using forever and I can
only assure you that I would never put
anything out on the market but the
absolute best I know it's just weird
whenever you sell something like this
you some people might just see an
eyeshadow palette I just see like so
much creation and so much thought and
heart that went into this and so I see
it I look at it and know it's just a
physical thing but I see so much more
than that when I look at it all right
here she goes she's gonna cry
I'm gonna do multiple multiple tutorials
with it right now we're gonna start with
the first tutorial with it which is the
look on my eye and I love this look some
and I know this videos gonna be long yep
but let's go ahead and start this makeup
tutorial I'm starting out with a fresh
cat's pajamas palette I can't get over
the glitter I'm looking in the
viewfinder
first I'm going to go in with okey dokey
I put this in the palette because I
use this every single time I store my
eyeshadow look I like to use it to
soften up my eyeshadow primer and that
way it helps everything to blend easier
so I'm going to take a with Emma
five seven three fluffy blender brush
I'm just gonna swirl it around in the
color like that tap off the excess now I
had my back Paint Pot on in soft ochre
as an eyeshadow primer and as you can
see I'm just gonna swivel swivel swivel
this around and I'm going to make sure
it just gets all over the eyelid just to
soften up the primer I personally have
to have a little bit of kick up I don't
like the shadows that are pressed too
hard and you can't get the pigment or
the color pop out of this shadow like I
might girl just give me give me a little
kick up okay I don't like too much kick
up though way you're wasting eyeshadow
or it's really creating a mess and it's
hard to pull in the shadows I just like
that perfect in between which is what we
spent a lot of time which has a lot to
do with the formula that eye shadow as
well as the pressure of the pressing I
shadow next I'm gonna take an art 38
brush it's like this long brush but it's
kind of tapered at the end a little bit
I'm going to take bomb-diggity which is
our mustard yellow pretty Brown fall ish
color so what I like to do is tap the
brush and then this is gonna be our
transition shade so I'm gonna pop it
right in the crease and I'm gonna go
back and forth windshield wiper motions
and just blend this color to the gods
above of makeup this is the color I use
every time when I use this palette as a
transition shade it does have a little
bit of a kick to it because it's like
that yellow undertone mustardy Brown but
I promise you whatever you get on your
eyelid your next shade we're gonna use
this cray cray and I'm gonna take it r39
brush you guys see when you tap it
around its minimal kick up but you do
get just a touch of fallout what I'm
gonna do with cray cray is I'm going to
focus it right here in the outer corner
so what I'm doing is I'm poking it right
into that inner corner right there just
like
I'll take what's left on the brush and
softly move it forward just a little bit
we don't want that much dark color you
guys can see that color kind of deepened
up a little where I was packing it and
right there it's like a really cool
eyeshadow I know it looks like a simple
I show I promise it's like a really cool
shade because you can build it up to
make it what color you want it to be if
you want it to be the light 1g fall
Chris Lee if you can until you like
poking and really deep and go in and it
can get a little bit deeper next we're
gonna take kooky oh my gosh I die for
kookie kookie is that cranberry matte
color so I'm gonna warm up the look a
little bit with kookie and like I don't
warm it up but more so add a little bit
of a reddish cranberry to it you can see
I'm just pressing it right on top of
that brown color but not taking it up
quite as high because I don't want to
explosion of kookie everywhere and now
also what you can do is take a clean
blender and just soften up those edges
and that's why I don't hum eyebrows on
right now so I can do this right here we
don't have to worry about messing up the
brows we are now going to skip over to
out the other which is our purple color
it's like a semi matte and it has a
little bit of sparkle to it the sparkle
doesn't go crazy on your eye so I don't
want you to be afraid of that spark
won't think you're gonna have a glitter
bomb on your eye out the other is a
little less press because I want to have
maximum pigmentation a little more
fallout comes out of out the other I'm
just going to take a baby baby baby
amount I'm just gonna so I just hit cray
cray which was our kwangji brown color
I'm just gonna dust it I'm gonna switch
brushes and take an m1 3:9 brush and tap
into oddball right here which does not
have a lot of fallout at all so I just
really want this crease outer crease
right here to have like a deepened
moment and because this brush has like
that tapered in I can really get in that
crease right there just all right your
eye should be looking like a beautiful
majestic fall leaf right now and now
we're gonna have fun and get into the
color sketch her brain hello there she
is right there or is our shimmery gold
color I personally always use
scatterbrain with my finger get some on
my hand just rub my finger in it you use
it whatever way you
I personally always no matter what what
my shimmers but just for the sakes of
people who don't I would love to show
you that it's insanely pigmented with or
without water this is no water what
you're seeing so I'm gonna dampen it a
little bit yes I'm spritzing like I
spray it in the air and then I run my
finger through the mist i don't directly
spray my finger and didn't see i'm just
pressing it and whenever i get to that
outer crease right there i just kind of
stop that way take this clean little
brush and just pop this i'm gonna take
eyeball on this flat brush this is a y21
i'm going to nudge it right there and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
ahead and line our eye with it i like
poking it in it's very pigmented black
you'll see you can use it like a liner
that's what I have been doing and I've
been loving this method I'm gonna curl
my lashes and add some Miami by Lily
lashes
I love these lashes so much they're so
VI boom they're a little bit heavy
because I love a lot of drama and
they're very fluttery and wispy as well
so if they're kind of great mix of heavy
and fluttering wispy noir see why I love
them so much
also this black line is gonna help hide
the lash fan I'm also gonna call my
lashes in a mascara we got a lot to do
but I will be right for the under eye
I'm gonna take bomb-diggity because this
color isn't bomb-diggity just buffing it
like I'm gonna adapt into a little bit
of cry cry and I'm gonna buff it from
inner to outer corners just like that
