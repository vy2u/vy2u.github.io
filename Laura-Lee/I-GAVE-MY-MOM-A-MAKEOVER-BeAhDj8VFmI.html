spongy thing my Mac the compact

started YouTube five years ago you

every single one all the videos she's my
biggest fan I think I am I watched your
latest one this morning I know I've
heard my voice playing in the living
room in a mine no well been on vacation
here so I have been able to watch the
arm it would have already watched
everybody some content mm-hmm had to
catch it I love to watch Laura and I
love social media cuz I'm in Alabama

her a lot mom what do you think about
drama channels the tea is hot honey

mm-hmm Kutty I like the foundation
that's pretty nice yeah
what concealer dears do you use any oh
yes I do I've got several different ones
I have Maybelline yeah that's what I've
been using here like I have sinned you
way you remember back in the days don't
only use like Mary Kay only Mary Kay
yeah that's right that was the cool
stuff when I was a young girl I went
high-end makeup and that was O'Meara
Norman uh-huh I always use Mira Norman I
would just go by the regular stuff even
you yeah
is a glim wait I really did back in that
day even I did a long make up and I'm
never would have thought that my
daughter had grown up to make a living
with being you know beauty and I
remember having any rules about like not
wearing makeup I love to make up my
whole life I've always worn makeup even
you know when I got old enough to start
wearing it and then when I started
working I started buying me a woman
because that was the thing at that time
then later on I went to Mary Kay she
moved on to Mary Kay which is absolutely
cheaper than Meryl Norman but it was a
more popular mm-hmm when my friends were
selling it so yeah so they talked me
into it you know and I got a peer
pressured into it so since then I
honestly in it I will be honest I use
what Laura gives me yeah Lord gives me
lots of my good and I work with the
children so yeah mom's a daycare telling
you you've been working with children I
have been at this particular place for
20 years Jesus I have three years and
before that didn't you like have a home
daycare idea when you were growing up I
wanted to be home with you children so I
kept other people's children in my home
she's a sweetie
here mm-hmm
always and I grew up with cats but our
cats had the stats of arm you had a cat
so they could kill snakes and rats
because that was hay in the barn and the
rats would get in the barn mm-hmm
I could spend hours sitting and playing
with the cats and we had chickens and we
had hogs and we had a big garden and
dirt roads and pickup trucks

the dresses within like in the big box
of Barbie you know what I mean

box of Barbies we like the clothes and
stuff

my life
eyebrows never look so good I'm shook
you did a great job on those those that
is my biggest trouble trouble putting
putting makeup on and putting doing my
eyebrows because they're very thin you
plucked them for too long I did back in
the day plucking the eyebrows was the
thing it was not for so long but I
finally stopped and it took me like so
many years and now I even still have to
draw them in like drastically yeah it's
just one of those things that I always
thought you had to do my sisters were
the same way
helps me and me and time been together
since high school yeah oh yeah I love me
some Tyler Tyler came over almost every
single day I had yes
I cook cook cook and I have I'm a very
country cook and that's your specialty
in life it's good yeah and so Tyler
would come over I always knew make food
for Tyler yep I've known Tyler for many
years and

one time in California and we were
getting in the Jeep and my sister closed
the car door the back car door twice but
she ain't closed it good so she redid it

doors closed in the back so Mama's
