today's video is going to be you guys
picked my makeup that's what I'm gonna
be using basically what you picked now I
went on my Instagram and so conveniently
they have like the polls thing now which
I love using all the time for all kinds
of things if you guys are not following
me
okay oh that's me on instagram is Laura
Lee and I went to Instagram stories and
did my subscribers pick my makeup like
did the polls for each section so how
all the winning items and I'm gonna do
basically a look with what you guys
chose for me
this is what you nine months ago Jamie
Page did this video so I think that's
who created this video concept I'm not
sure but Jamie page like me looking at
my subscribers for my makeup and
scrolling through that is the lay that
are the oldest video that I found though
shout out to her and without further ado
will now sing the SUBSCRIBE song and
then we get started with this video
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video
I forgot to dress me every time I wear a
tube top which I do have on people
assume I'm just filming titties out and
I normally don't sit here with just my
boobs hanging out filming a video so yes
I have clothes on for those of you
wondering you're not gonna see a nip
slip in here I wanna pull up on my phone
and show you guys what I pitted against
each other and what you guys went with
primer I said talk show versus Smashbox
and you guys pick the tatcha so canvas
this is what it looks like and I really
been enjoying this product a lot so what
I like to do is get a little on my hand
like this I'll rub it together and then
I will massage it into my skin honey I
put the a BH brow definer against the
precisely my brow pencil and you guys
picked precisely my red pencil I love
both of the products and I use this in
shade number four so let me just carve
out these brows that normally takes me
the longest although I do it pretty
quickly but I do my brows I like to use
a close-up Mir
then I like a faraway mirror sitting
right here so that way I can kind of go
back and forth and see how they really
look from far away next up let's go
ahead and do foundation now this was
Finn T versus wet-and-wild and I was
wondering if a really popular product
such as Finn T would beat out a really
great affordable products that's just
wet and wild and that's why I put them
together and you guys think Finn T so
the more hyped up product definitely won
the case but we do love the wear of it
and the finish it's nice by the way guys
I am having a meet and greet at the
morphe store I'll put all the
information down below on the 19th of
this month and I'm really excited and I
hope to meet some of you guys there but
again I'll have all the information for
my meet-and-greet in the description box
down below it's a store opening for
morphe it's one of their new stores and
I'll put the address and everything but
yeah it's gonna be from 11 o'clock to
1:30 on the 19th of May it's good
hallelujah we have success darling for
concealer I pitted NARS concealer
against color pop so I was wondering
both of these are popular to be fair so
I was wondering at two popular
concealers with the affordable or the
NARS expensive or not affordable one win
and the affordable one why no this one
is beige 25 this color is a bit pink
it's actually pink AF but I'm gonna use
it flip up has a wild amount of
concealer shade option so I feel like
because there's so many options
sometimes they like overwhelms me and I
don't know my shade exactly but I just
pick one and hope for the best when I
take this more piquant or sponge and
just go ahead and blend it on out
I really like to just tap a type of type
of type of tap I tap it out okay and
then pour powder
I put the NYC loose powder which is a
drugstore powder against the cover FX
perfecting setting powder and you guys
picked from a long shot the cover so I
was like okay just to let you guys know
a lot of these products you the the poll
is so close on some it was not I'm just
gonna dip this little contour sponge
into the powder and then I just like to
press it that way we get nice and baked
next up I put the morphe at 9:08 h
palette which is dere new contour
palette against a new or the marc jacobs
tantastic which they just re-released
kinda shook but for a very long shot you
guys pick the morphe one my favorite
color and the 8h palette is Dona Dona is
also in the second palette which is the
8l lo-fi palette and this is what I like
to contour with and I like to use an R
14 brush to do it with and I just did a
full video on like how I contour like
do's and don'ts of it so if you guys are
struggling with contouring by any means
honey go check out my video I'll link it
down below but it's just a do's and
don'ts of contour and highlighting and
it's very helpful and I do use this
palette in it to show you you know it
drives me crazy about my hair and this
is Randall but I have a cowlick right
here that goes up and it's been there
literally my whole life you just see how
this lays flat it won't because the
cowlick right there
oh it drives me crazy but I feel like
everybody has like little things that
maybe other people don't notice so much
about themselves that just kind of annoy
them but that is definitely one of my
things about myself that like really
annoys me I'm like why is that cowlick
there let's do the eyes and then I'll do
with blush and highlight so why I like
to the hoop so I pitted nudie booty
against cat's pajamas and right
longshots you guys want it nudie
patootie
and I don't blame you if she's new she's
fresh she's amazing she's beautiful I'm
so as cats but cats has been out since
October you guys want another book with
this because I know the lip product you
guys picked which I'll show you at the
end I think I know what look I want to
do
I've been using shadow shield I should
have put these in a pole against tape
hard part about these it's just getting
them even on both eyes and only takes me
a second first I'm going to go in with
the color undress in five seven three on
I'm just gonna put this all over and
only start every look with this color
regardless of what look I'm doing I'm
gonna go in with shrinking with the r39
brush and this is just a soft matte
shade I'm really gonna work this just in
the crease because today I am gonna do a
cut crease color streaking it looks
really light in the pan but the color
actually builds up pretty dark if you
keep adding layers of it so it's not as
light as it seems and you can build it
up to be pretty dark I have a booger in
my nose and what I like to do with
streaking is just get a little bit of
the tip of the brush and just you can
see where my eye crease is to kind of go
along with the crease
I'm now on the same brush gonna use the
color stripped which is like a golden
matte mustard shade it's really pretty
and this color to it can't go on super
yellow mustard unless you start building
it up or mixing it with other Browns and
then it gets a little bit deeper which I
think looks really nice
I'm gonna take some reveal just keep
building up colors in the crease this is
typically how I do my cut crease is I
like to just start off with lighter
colors and then build it up a little
deeper a little deeper a little deeper
so next I'll take a little bit of butt
naked after ovale which is our next
darker Brown his butt naked Roy heshes
nice
I take Nicky Nicky which is our deepest
brown shade on this little teensy tiny
detail brush and I'm going to kind of
trace out more the cut crease so it was
way more defined now go back in with
that our 39 brush and just really
lightly soften that up so it's not too
crazy we only wanted to be a little bit
crazy but not too crazy next I'm gonna
take some of this
Lancome I base on a little flat brush
and this is where I clean up the lid
this part is probably the most tedious
out of the cut crease to me I'm super
close to the mic right now by the way so
this is about the tip turn into one of
those legs they call it as some more or
ASMR I thought about doing one of those
in makeup tutorial form a long time ago
but my voice is so annoying as people
have let me know my whole entire career
and like I would cringe if I had to hear
my voice that close in that loud like
for twenty thirteen to twenty minutes
however long the video would be like I
think I would die inside for the sake of
my youtube career I better just not do
that video for the main attraction
I want a peachy eye and so I'm gonna use
Behr she's gonna use em two to four
brush to add it I was at the morphe
store this week and I picked up this
brush because I don't know it just like
intrigued me and I hadn't seen it before
so I was like let me try this little
brush out real quick next up I'm gonna
take a little bit of Stark which is our
light shimmery color and put it in the
inner corner I'm gonna spritz a little
bit anytime I use a shimmer eye well you
guys are like girl we know this ain't
new Sun I really like to dampen it but I
do not dampen any of my Matt's ever it
will like ruin a Matt and now I'm just
gonna take that same brush and rub a
little bit of Stark on the brow bone I
initially put stark in the palette
because whenever I came out with cats
people really request it for my next
palette
a shimmery instead of a matte light
shade in it so that's what Oh eyeliner I
asked you guys I think I put the more
people actual liner versus the Kat Von D
tattoo eyeliner and so many of my
friends use this eyeliner and swear by
by it it turned me on to it and I've
been looking for a really good pen liner
because lately I've been slaying pin
liners guys picked through this one so
here I go or mascara I put deed your
pump mascara versus the L'Oreal lash
paradise and you guys for a very long
shot pick the L'Oreal lash paradise and
I do like this mascara a lot I like both
of them a lot there's so many good
drugstore mascaras you guys love when
you miss the tube of mascara and it just
sucks down your arm
come on Lily lashes in Miami I put Miami
against me canals which are both by Lee
lashes but you guys like girls in Miami
kind of I did not do blush I guess I was
just a silly Billy and it forgot my mind
or I left my mind so I'm just gonna put
bare on it for blush and in the nudie
patootie campaign we actually used bare
as the blush on me and like all the
models for highlighter I put the Estee
Lauder heat wave against the one and
only AVH X I'm Rosie so you guys
definitely pick this one for my lower
lash line I want to keep it light and
peachy so I'm just gonna buff bear all
over then I'm going to take this little
important brush and grab some butt naked
and just buff it really close to my
lower lash line just to smoke it out a
wee bit I went ahead and put on some
mascara to the lower lashes and now for
lips I asked you guys oh six that are
launching at the end of this month or if
you guys want me to use a new Kylie
color
this color kind of inspired me to do a
peachy look with my palette so what's
gonna do one with jaybird but I'll say I
do a peach cuz my lips are gonna be
peach this color is la by the way this
is a velvet which is pretty comfortable
this is the finished look I hope you
