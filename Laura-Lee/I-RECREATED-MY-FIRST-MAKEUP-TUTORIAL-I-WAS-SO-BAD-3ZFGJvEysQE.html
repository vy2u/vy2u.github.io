glass of water
hey guys what's up welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be me
recreating my first makeup tutorial and
disclaimer before we jump into this
video I just want to say I started
YouTube when I wasn't that great at I
could have sworn I slide honey I was
pretty sure I was like a makeup Slayer
and a lot of my videos I'd put on
private from my past because they're
just so embarrassing I've always loved
my first youtube video ever post it up
because it's like I want that baby to
give it in Spokeo people like oh you can
make it but you know the other ones I
just feel like we didn't need to see
them all we could just we'll just throw
those under the rock so I kind of
watched over the video a little bit a
little bit shook it as to how bad it was
now my makeup skills are gone just
didn't eat better and I'm going to do
the same look which the video is a
neutral eye shocking right with a hot
pink lip which I don't know why I
decided to do that look but that's what
we're gonna do you guys are gonna take
this journey with me a lot of you guys
have never seen this footage before
because this video has been on private
for a really long time and I went ahead
and made it public so if you guys wanted
to watch a little video you definitely
could but just know I did do it get
ready with me style which I won't do
this video that way we'll chat a little
bit but so without further ado we'll
sing the subscribe song and then we'll
jump right in today's video and we'll go
down memory lane let's do it hey let's
go ahead and jump right into the video
okay so add the video on my phone I'm
gonna put it on the screen so you guys
can watch it with me but I'm gonna watch
it on my phone I know this video is
unmonitored because I didn't know like
this was literally my second or third
video I'd ever uploaded to YouTube this
was back in 2013 and I had no idea that
about like copyright music and also and
notice this first thing I went in the
look on my face in the shape of my
eyebrows is enough to make me scream
just so you guys know but I went in and
also the camera quality was just pure
trash but I couldn't help that okay I
was using like that camcorder for like
mom's would shoot soccer games with I'm
gonna prime which I don't think I did
then and I'm just gonna use this a
little bit of this Bobbi Brown prep
which I really like this product I'm
just gonna put that on with this contour
sponge and then I went in with a
foundation which seemed to be a bit
orange for my skin so not much has
changed I remember I used the benefit
oxygen while foundation which was one of
my first ever high-end foundations I
wish I still had that foundation but I
wasn't as full coverage back then I was
working full time at a doctor's office
so I couldn't I mean I guess I could but
I didn't really wear that full coverage
or makeup but today I'm gonna be using
the Laura Mercier at flawless fusion
this is one of my favorite foundations
at the moment why six honey I'm just
gonna feed it in I had this speed turned
up so fast in this video no huh anyone
with comprehending anything I was doing
it looks like I buff that in with the
Real Techniques brush it's a little
aggressive
she took it down to the neck good job
Laura we'll go in the order of the video
it looks like next I did my eyebrows
with a Mac pencil which it's not what I
use any more from my brows I definitely
use is the brow definer and then
precisely my brow pencil from benefit my
brows were so thin back then I remember
to always go to the nail salon on my
lunch break and get them to wax off all
my eyebrow hairs and I why why did I
think that was a good idea why was I
like yes like take all the hairs off but
I always thought I don't know like if
you just have bushy eyebrows with unkept
and now I'm like
please give me back my brow hairs sorry
I don't have a lot of the same products
for this video I truly wish I did cuz I
think it would make the video even
better but I don't got them and I'm pre
filming for Japan okay here I go
the other brow my brows literally like
and just I just took it well and that's
it now I was good she was just uh real
easy with it type of girl so I went in
with my back Paint Pot in soft ochre and
it looks like I primed my eyelids so I'm
actually gonna do the same thing I'm
still using it how many years later five
years later still using it so she's just
gonna prime these eyelids I did then
after I prime my eyelid I went in with
the Too Faced candle blow now it looks
like I went in with our became Naked
palette and did a super messy but
neutral look so I guess I'm gonna start
out with this look mixing undress and
streaking together right here I'm just
gonna kind of blend them because I think
that's like a similar color
I remember at this time in my life I was
living in a house we were renting with
two other girls and this was probably
the most confusing time in my life like
as far as like I know what I was gonna
do but I know I didn't like where I was
that and this was a very like tough year
for me but like one of my most learning
great years as it turned out I think
that whenever you go through really hard
years they can either be like a really
big learning curve for your life or they
could just be a bad year it's kind of
what you make of it and what you can get
out of it every hard experience can be a
great learning experience that's what I
have found with my years on this planet
and you know it's not like my life is
perfect now and everything sunshine and
rainbows and we don't have bad years
anymore bad months or bad days I
definitely do but I try to learn from it
my past and just trying to remember it
is a learning experience the past all
together but I am glad I made the
decisions that I made and took the
chances that I took you guys didn't know
I did do a video reacting to my first
youtube video and I got there emotional
in that video because I hadn't actually
watched the video in a really long time
so it was just like shocking to me to
see how far I had come and I did on
camera which I think was a great
experience for me and for my audience
because we both saw how far I had come
without even really realizing it and I
was just so proud of myself
I still him now I'll tap into a little
bit of reveal which is a cooler deeper
Brown which is probably closer to one of
the shades and those palettes or
something like that I think a lot of the
shades and those palettes are cool tones
what would be interesting is if I was
able to look back in a few years from
now and laugh at my makeup skills no I'm
kidding but laugh at well hell I might
enjoy the Bliss of where I'm at and to
see how far I will have come in another
five years five years is a long time
especially in the YouTube world five
years like 10 years or I don't know it's
like YouTube years or like in dog years
like you just add times seven I did the
light color on first which is very
strange and then I went in with the
deeper colors and blended out the crease
I've literally flicked that now and I
wouldn't do my makeup like that you'll
get a much more cleaner look if you do
it how I do it now trust me also I
remember I was living with two girls and
AD started this YouTube journey I was
just diving into it I'm actually taking
butt naked now and I remember like I
would film all they weren't home but I
anything I like your noise I'd like
because if they were home or they walked
in and caught me I would have died I
would have been so mortified I was so
weird what I was doing but I was doing
it anyways but and putting it on the
Internet is if they weren't gonna see it
gonna take just a touch of cray-cray and
just pop it right
just write on me and eyeball
I remember this get ready with me was
way more of a comfortable way for me to
film because I wasn't that comfortable
talking to you guys no that's what I
love today I'm gonna take a little bit
more of that Paint Pot and just go ahead
and clean up my eyelids so I can put
down the neutral color now I'm gonna go
in with okey dokey cuz I did put a matte
shade on my eyelid so this is a great
just little matte shade I'm gonna use a
morphe m22 for softening of that and
then i'm gonna put a little bit of Stark
which is our light shimmery shade on my
brow bone you guys think I'm really
rough of a makeup now looking at this
and my girls oh my god then I put Mac
expensive pink on top wow I didn't
realize I did that okay so for it a pink
color I'm just gonna add a little bit of
topless kind of like I didn't realize I
had put expensive pink on top well I'm
sure it myself right now
topless is like a pretty light pink
color
add the exact concealer and I have it in
the exact shade so you guys believe me
that this has just always been like my
ride-or-die honey NYX makes a good
concealer and I'm glad that I'm finally
doing the rest of my face makeup I did
my makeup in such random order back now
and it looks like I just blended it out
with my finger which today we have
stepped it up a little bit we have fun
just now we have brushes now oh there
she goes she got this bun she got the
sponge we're good I feel like I'm moving
so fast because obviously I sped it up
types of million which is almost
impossible for you guys to see plus the
lining is yeah I'm having a hard time
following I'm like huh
trying to hurry the thing that's gonna
drive me crazy is the fact that I didn't
put on setting powder next I just went
into doing my liner while this just got
all creepy and crazy also I don't have
any lip fillers in this video soon I am
gonna add a little bit of setting powder
because that's just what it would be now
that's just the T great news is I
actually had my Mac blunt right here and
I'm not sure if this is the exact same
one from back from him but it might be
this is actually a great product to
contour with one
Wow I feel like I need to use this more
I really this this cold uh so creamy it
appears that I did take a little bit of
some black Neutrogena eyeliner and just
line across the top and then did my
lashes so that's one Monday I did put on
some mascara so I'm gonna add some of
this milk makeup cush mascara which I do
like this mascara a lot it's super bomb
it looks like I added some black
eyeshadow so I'm gonna take okie-dokie
and run it along the lower lash line
that was mighty bold of me not really
sure why I did this I'm gonna take some
a cray cray I'm just gonna smoke that
out a little bit for blush I use a
pretty blush from NYX I'm just gonna go
in with a little bit of bear oh I
remember this before a highlighter I got
it on clearance and I lived it so I'm
gonna go in I do not have that anymore
I'm gonna go in with this highlighter
from cipa called
starburst
and then I just randomly put face powder
all over my face I don't know but I must
get that step oh and then I put
translucent powder all over my face as
well so oh this is mascara part so I'm
gonna Ala Moana you're on girl
choose the XXL mascara by Maybelline oh
my god like I'm talking so fast because
the video is going so fast on these real
natural lashes I love these you see the
lashes are so long for my lipstick I got
a little bit of crazy which by the way
this video was 4 minutes long oh Jesus I
couldn't do a four-minute video if I
tried to now but I bought this super hot
pink color and then I put on like neon
white pink on top of it don't know why I
thought that was flattering but I got a
sore knit what I'm gonna put on the
Kylie Jenner this is st. amour super hot
pink about as hot pink as I can get it
that is it for this video um wow it's
fun reminiscing and looking at my
content you guys can clearly see how
much I've grown the light it was almost
just dark it was just dark AF I don't
know why I was filming that dark but you
can barely say anything behind the
window I should have been facing the
window I didn't know nothing okay I was
learning I learned a lot
I wouldn't particularly do this look now
like I'd probably do a different eye
with the lip or something but it turned
out alright because i redid it had a
couple of the products which i had all
of them that I had done used back then
