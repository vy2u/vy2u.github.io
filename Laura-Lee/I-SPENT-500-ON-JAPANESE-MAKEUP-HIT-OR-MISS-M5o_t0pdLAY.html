channel today's video is going to be Wow
my reading hurt my head stays video it's
gonna be me testing out a bunch of
makeup I got my owls in Japan okay I may
have went a little crazy while shopping
there which I'll take you with me
shopping in just a moment we saw a
makeup store while we were there and my
eyes lit up I was like oh my god I was
just throwing everything my basket
frantically I think I spin around
Oh whenever she told me my total
well-being in Japan I also saw the
makeup trend there which is much
different from the makeup that we wear
in the United States it also inspired me
a little bit I have tried out some
Japanese and Korean makeup and it didn't
work for me does I wear my makeup a bit
heavier and differently and when I
notice there is very light makeup really
bright peachy cheeks even peachy all
through here peachy eyes lip like a tint
only like a glassy tint false lashes are
definitely a thing there and brow tint
but not how we fill in like shark cut
your heart out
eyebrows the makeup is very much lighter
I want to do a makeup tutorial inspired
off what I saw there but if I were to do
that in today's video I wouldn't be able
to test out nearly half of these
products because I got so much stuff I
want to try it out and their makeup is
just so light and only a few products
used so the future I will do a kind of
like a Japanese inspired makeup tutorial
but I was very inspired going there and
I got a lot of inspiration for myself
while being there and it had a really
good time to find a foundation majority
of their foundations they have like
three to four shades and they're all
very lighter shades so I could not find
a foundation for me
but I found I went to this store right
here etude house and I found this
foundation and I bought the darkest
shade that they had and I think it's
gonna work for me something
jet lag is hitting me like I pissed in
the 8th I want to sleep so bad so if I'm
a little in this video you know what's
happening anyways we're gonna sing some
scraps off and then we're gonna jump
right into mesh baby okay be sure and
subscribe now let's go ahead and jump
right into this video
single shadow
they're like hella glittery
I think I start with pulling all the bag
and like looking at what I got look at
this mascara adware they covered the
eyeballs oh they put it up here though
go they let you know she's wearing a
false lash out of their brow products
was like tattoo tattoo tattoo so that's
like the brow tinting thing is like
really popular it was really interesting
to see a lot of L'Oreal brands and
things brands that I do recognize but
they come out with different products
that they don't sell in the United
States
I have tried these out before they sell
these on Amazon and now I understand the
more everything's really inky and like
soft washes of color look at this
L'Oreal lipstick though there's that
packaging man in the United States oh so
pretty I actually forgot that I found
this foundation and I kind of want to
try it it's light infusing foundation so
everything is like light infused liquid
cream I think I've said that about six
times now so you're like we got okay we
got it
I did find an interesting product which
let me tell you about it is the Norfolk
no poor plum this is one of my favorite
primers but it's like liquid in a pump
but I found it in a compact and they
give you a sample of the one that I have
which I thought that was really cute wow
I am an idiot I thought this was a
facial primer girl it's a powder
Etha powder and it's not my shade right
some protection is a huge thing there
compared to the United States I remember
we were in the cabin when the taxi man
the Sun came out and it got on his hands
he stopped and was like put his gloves
on his hands to cover it so the sunlight
wouldn't hit his hands which I thought
that was just beautiful I loved it a lot
of foundation compact makeup and I
didn't realize that that was of what I
was buying but girl this packaging dope
okay don't have a facial primer and
honestly that's okay you don't have to
have a facial primer so I'm gonna go in
with foundation Oh almost dropped it so
I have to lucky me the L'Oreal one
definitely looks a bit deeper but I
still want to try out the one that I
went all the way to this specific store
to to get and can you guess what brush
I'm gonna use today let's say it
together
the larlie morphe brushes bundle is a
back in style baby get it was hot and
don't forget to use my coat lauralee to
save you 10% off yes ma'am I like a
feeling in my bones it was gonna be a
little too light but I don't think
actually it smells so good it smells
like a yummy perfume and by the way all
their facial products had loads of
sunscreen in it they do not play okay
we shouldn't either the Sun will give
you wrinkles and cancer this is no
coverage but it's still beautiful at the
same time so on this half of the face
let's try out the L'Oreal one somebody
asked me if I learned any Japanese and
language before I went and I was like
girl I still don't know English okay see
this is very watery and pink but I think
once we blend it out it won't be so bad
and it's okay not to always be full
covered you know I think it looks really
pretty and I you guys it's weird like I
never really have appreciated my skin
but you guys you haven't given me so
many compliments on my skin it's like
made me appreciate my skin more like you
guys did that both foundations are
similar there just liquidy BB creams and
I'm at it for concealer as I like to
call it we are gonna try out this one
but it is in Japanese so I don't know
exactly what it says but we're gonna try
it out because with this BB cream her
bags are showing
okay I'm gonna take my morphe beauty
blender this is the contour sponge and
I'm gonna blend this out it's really
pretty I like it I mean is it like super
full coverage no did I expect that
absolutely not so it's really pretty
I'll go ahead and tell you one thing I
didn't find and I know why I didn't find
it it was a bronzer I saw a lot of a
more fresher skin and very peachy cheeks
more so than like I'm gonna do is take
one of my 18 facial powders that I
bought because they are a lighter shade
I'm gonna go ahead and set this makeup
the Cinderella one looks super light so
I think I'm gonna take this touching
sole one on a brush I'm gonna use my Y
11 brush and get some on there it also
has like a yellowy tint to it so I think
it'll look oh yeah look really nice with
the concealer but I don't want to put on
too much around the cheek area because
I'm going to put some cream blush on
today which I'm really excited about so
I guess I am kind of putting on like a
little bit of an interpretation of the
makeup that I saw there um everything I
saw in makeup and packaging and dot is
very very dolly pink bows Hello Kitty
really cute cute cute stuff as long as
under eyes increasing girl we can keep
moving on oh man I could have put this
on a marshmallow finish I'm just gonna
put it on my hands cuz we need to try it
out together a quite girl this video
might get a little long but you're gonna
get a snacking and a hang out with me
well if you feel like the video is too
long you can go to the speed and hit the
little nut and you can go to the speed
and you can change the speed Oh and
speed it up I normally do 1.5 on
everyone's video okay so this is
moisture but it's this is like it has
tint to it it's like another yeah I
couldn't have this is like Oh white BB
cream I also got this silent and below
concealer which I'm gonna put that on my
forehead a little bit oh it's got a
sponge tip like a little bit of a
brightener oops that kind of fade it
into like literally nothing
so we're not missing out on anything
here I also got this lore'l glow blush
and you open it up and it's a bright
peach cushion which again I was telling
you this is like what I saw everywhere
so I'm actually gonna put my own sponge
in it very lightly but honestly this is
like okay I went in kind of hard but
that's okay once you blend it out it
gives you like this beautiful peachy
glow across this cheeky vici and a
cookie wookie I bought sunscreen and I
thought it was makeup cool feel like I
should try out this one day tattoo
strong waterproof and I'm gonna let you
know like I'm scared to put this on my
eyebrows right now oh sorry this does
not work out for me
oh way is this eyeliner this is eyeliner
this is not for my brows brow product
right here tattoo one day tattoo you
I've tried these out before mind you so
here I go again that is a pretty brow in
the meantime while my brows are drying I
bought this glow Luminizer
add a little bit of it to the sponge and
now we're going to new Minelli's it is
beautiful and it has a lot of sunscreen
SPF 28 in it
I really like the Luminizer I think it's
gorgeous
so I got this blushing heart which is
supposed to be a blush a baked blush but
I'm gonna put it on just a little bit
kind of looks like a highlighter to me
oh no it's definitely blushy it's just
like a super shimmery blush my pores are
like magnified times 80 right now but
see like these cheeks are very much so
what I saw the trend was I'm gonna go
ahead and put on a little bit of
eyeshadow there what wasn't like
eyeshadow palettes and like a lot of
eyeshadow herself but I saw these really
cool from the witch's brew that was like
a popular brand there and then this
matte eyeshadow dish one so it was like
little individual eyeshadows that were
available so we're gonna try out a few
of them today
oh my gosh this is actually an orange
blush but we're gonna use it as
eyeshadow a lot of pigment off of it so
it just added a small flush of orange
color to the eyes I really want to go in
with this number two it's like this
beautiful foiled eyeshadow it wow really
cool foiled eyeshadow now as you guys
know we have a pulled eyeshadow I'm
forgetting how to speak via foiled
eyeshadow in my eyeshadow palette and I
do find that they work with best with
the glitter glue so I'm gonna put down a
glitter glue to give it a fair shot I'll
take a little bit of the Too Faced
glitter glue well shadows can definitely
work without glitter glue but they
definitely perform better and you have
less fallout when you do have a little
something tacky down or if you wet the
shadow as well that works so I like to
apply this with my finger so I'm just
gonna go round and round oh my gosh this
is a gorgeous my eyelid looks wet I know
it's hard to see past my brows but just
bear with me this is so pretty I wish
they sold these individually in the
United States
wow wow wow it's funny how I was like
I'm not gonna do that type of makeup
because I want to do try out all this
makeup but me trying out this makeup is
turning into that kind of makeup and I'm
not mad at it I like you know want you
guys to see it anyway so hey here we go
okay I'm gonna add a little bit of liner
because I did buy this pin liner and
lately I've been loving them so much I
just want to see like how this works
is it worth my time I don't know sorry I
always have to lean down on the winged
liner parts guys oh shoot I think the
winged liner is gonna be really good
the liner if you can see the iphoto is
kind of going through it so it's not a
very like pope knit one so I think it
would be probably prettiest used without
such a heavy eyeshadow I know a look
back with these brows on but they're
gonna come off in a second just hang
tight next I'm gonna try out the
waterproof strong Volume Mascara
I don't really see it doing much for my
lashes but it takes like a really strong
mascara to lift these lashes up so this
one is kind of a flop I'm gonna take a
little bit of our orange blush /i shadow
if you will and just give it a pop
alright next I'm gonna go ahead and try
to peel off these brows which I hope
they come off easy oh my gosh and the
10th definitely works wow it's actually
really pretty like the tinting that's
really pretty I mean is so soft and
subtle but I like it do you guys like my
pillow off method just rub really hard
instead of being gentle like the way
they look
do I like a fuller brow normally
absolutely but I mean they don't look
bad so I'm kind of in it my makeups
lighter altogether anyways I definitely
want to try out this gorgeous L'Oreal
lipstick oh girl is like oh it's just
glitter
it's just shimmer honey very light very
shimmer very pretty now I want to try
some I mean why I thought this was a lip
tint but I'm realizing it's mascara oh
my god that's like red oh oh honey I
want to put some of this blush on my
lips to show you guys the light wash of
color kind of like that and a lot of
popsicle lips if you guys don't know
what that is I'll put a picture right
here I saw a lot of that I'll probably
put some a dish too
all right this is my makeup basically in
the style that I saw it in Japan I think
it's really beautiful it's really fresh
and it is very different so what I'm
gonna do now that I've tried out all the
products is put an American spin on it
and show you guys as an American what I
would do with the makeup so first I'm
gonna go ahead and eye out some wrongs
our girl
you already know she was gonna go in
with a bronzer I'm gonna go in with a
matte brown eyeshadow and just add a few
little so freckles I have real freckles
as well on my nose because these are
kind of cheesy faux freckles like super
big what I like to do is just dab them
out a little bit and stopping them up a
little bit more so we have dimension in
size also look at this little tint that
I found isn't this the cutest it's a lip
tint I told you guys everything there
was like the cutest thing ever
oh it unscrews right here oh oh that's
just precious
I'm sorry I'm gonna add house of lashes
in Ellora light alright and this is the
makeup look with a little bit of an
American touch to it I think it turned
out really beautiful I hope you guys
liked this video with me testing out all
these products there are a lot of really
amazing products I would say the only
things that really didn't work for me
I'm noticing some major creasing with
the concealer so I probably wouldn't use
it again and then the mascara was little
snot what else there is one more thing
now I do not know whether there is so
much stuff on my desk right now no I
kind of liked everything else right I
think those it I think those the only
two things out of all this makeup that
just really just wasn't for me
I had a really great time in Japan it
was such a great experience and thank
you guys for being here and watching I
love you guys to death be sure and
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and become a lolli today a joint
aren't gang we have a lot of fun over
here
