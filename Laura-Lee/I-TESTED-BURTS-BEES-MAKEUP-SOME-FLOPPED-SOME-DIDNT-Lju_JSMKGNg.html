today's video is going to be a much
requested video is going to be review of
the Burt's Bees makeup line no I think
Burt's Bees has been around for a long
time their skincare and lip products but
they came out with me I want to say
recently but it's really been like a few
months I'm just really late I'm
reviewing it because I'm late on doing
things and boy came out with like a full
makeup line with such as foundations and
mascaras and eyeshadows and blushes and
so on
so I want to be doing like a first
impressions tutorial with that today and
telling you guys my thoughts about it as
I go through the video so I hope you're
excited about that I think it's about
time I review it I've been really
interested in and I went to like two
different Ulta they didn't have it in
store I went to a CVS they don't have an
in store so I finally just ordered it on
ulties website and they had it all there
now um I think the price is low Burt's
Bees is like drugstore but it's like
bougie drugstore that makes sense cuz
it's kind of sort of pricey for the
drugstores so this make up from the
drugstore I'm hoping it'll be pretty
good because it's not well especially at
Ulta at least it's not the cheapest
drugstore makeup no it's not obviously
it's expensive it's the flora makeup but
girl I was like okay okay see you what
the prices were drugstore makeup um that
might just be me though I like I say
went wild and Rimmel more like really
low and then you have like L'Oreal
Maybelline and now you got Burt's Bees
but I'm excited to review it so without
further ado I'm gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE
song and a wee little Allah okay let's
go ahead and jump right into the video
sleeping under me it's Lu my little
black kitty
he is never inside and lately he's like
I'm not going out in the backyard I
don't know what what the deal is but he
nin - it's the first time I pry my skin
because there is not a facial primer
with Burt's Bees at least there wasn't
sold one online so I'm gonna pry my skin
will get start with the foundation I'm
gonna go ahead and put on a little bit
of Mario but let's go spritzers I just
like this I feel like it makes the skin
refreshed and it also smells delish oh
it tastes horrible
and the spritzer is powerful but I still
like okay so I ordered two shades at the
foundation and you gotta be careful with
these foundation shades because I'm
going to show you I got one two three
five and one forty so thirty five and
forty I should say if you can see like
this is yellow this is pink I'm
definitely gonna go with this one this
one's way too pinky for me and the
colors are so completely different but I
believe these are all in one step from
one another so you definitely got to be
careful with ordering the shades I'm
gonna use the 35 one soft honey but the
bottle is really cute I like the B
packaging oh it's a pump girl I got the
pump too weird like the 140 is way this
is just weird
dude there's a mean way to like this
will having some Laura buys her
foundation online I mean sometimes I get
it rights like I know my shade but
here's the thing like I'm normally like
a honey or natural beige but every brand
calls their foundation honey a natural
beige and it's a completely different
shade some Cheeseman why six maybe it
won't be too bad so far it's not too too
bad hmmm the coverage of this film it
smells a little weird it smells kind of
like there's skincare products which is
like really natural kind of strong and
it feels good on my skin but it has like
no coverage cuz you see this red zit hmm
it's almost kind of like a lightweight
foundation not a lot of coverage good to
know so if you're not a full curve girl
you might like this one
add just a little bit more to layer it
up a little to the beat it feels nice
and tacking it's like going on the skin
really pretty just like coverage I would
say so I think this is supposed to be a
glowy foundation because it says
goodness close
oh Jesus it says a full coverage mineral
formula they better settle down this is
I was his is actually a little bit far
from full coverage see I would say just
as far as like literally I have redness
right here and right here from is it and
me packing it on really tightly maybe
give it to a medium coverage but I don't
think this is full coverage now I do use
like an Arthur G wave which is very full
cover so I am comparing this to like a
super full coverage situation but
coverage medium coverage at best it's
not heavy or greasy it feels super
moisturizing I completely agree with
that and it has meadow foam seed oil is
known for moisturizing skin naturally
beautiful Zola drops it okay I think
it's a nice foundation just don't think
it's full coverage but I think it is a
nice foundation so far it does feel
somewhat lightweight so let's move on
I'm going to ask my own concealer
exceiiency they had concealer so I'm
just gonna put a little bit of my
concealer on the baby you guys never see
next up I have some of their medified
powder which I think the packaging is
really cute for I'm gonna put some of my
under-eye it was a little bee situation
I don't know I think it's really cute
and it feels really heavy and nice I
bought it in shade almond and shade
vanilla I'm going to take an eight forty
eight and nine oh my gosh
look how much comes off very pigmented
and it's very soft powder like it feels
like I can never talk and put on powder
because that's what I got I inhale it
and I'm like I don't know I feel like
I'm the only one who does that on you
too in there I see other Beauty people
pack on powder and just talk away and
I'm like how are you guys doing that I
can't I don't know if it's just me but
it's in my head I don't know
anyways I can't do it but I'm going to
put this powder on and it feels like
pure silk on my under eye so it feels
really nice so I just added the lighter
vanilla powder where places the need
highlighting it's coming to add almond
which is a little bit more deeper to
other places with ay5 kind of like a
contoured area I think what I was hoping
on the website when I ordered this I
could use it like a bronzer but I
definitely cannot because the colors are
a little light which sucks myself today
to Thai it's only home and I can like
call mom's phone come in the room in
help me Alex I'm like in a quick
contraction where I have to like take
part of it down to get out of my
contraption to get one little thing and
say we're annoying guys it's super
annoying but that's okay we're gonna
keep the party moving because that
powder won't work as a bronzer I'm just
gonna add a little bit on and then we
will move on to blush and eyes and all
kinds of fun stuff
for blush I got shy at pink it looks so
pretty again it has the little honeycomb
on it and this is a hundred percent
natural what it says blush with bamboo
to be completely honest I don't know
what blush with bamboo means maybe it's
something good for your skin I don't
know it but it is nice it's a hundred
percent natural so I'm going to apply
this with an angled brush this is an e4
which is a fabulous blush brush
oh this color is pretty it's a very
pretty pink really is complementing my
skin little rosy I'm kind of getting
back into blush a little bit I know I
was out of it for a minute but now I'm
like it so I'm gonna add a little bit of
highlighter unfortunately they don't
have a highlighter yet and I'm like you
know I got like a greasy piece of
chicken I got two other eyeshadow
palettes I got bloomin desert &amp;amp; Country
saddle I like these names are so funny
they crack me up but their little
eyeshadow palettes and they have three
eyeshadows in them each so let's just
watch and see I'm skeptical so they're
all three shimmer in the first palette
the desert palette and they feel a
little bit dry so I'm a little nervous
feels like a desert I mean oh girl the
center color feels like crap and the
white one's super pigmented and this one
feels like chalkiness oh Jesus baby
Jesus and my job is to make this work on
my eyes but just know based off swatches
it feels like caca so I'm gonna go ahead
take a morphe impact 7-3 brush and tap
into the lightest shade of this palette
apply that all over you guys know I
normally do this to soften up the primer
I had down in this case I just have some
concealer down which makes everything
blend a lot easy on my doll like oh yeah
these colors don't feel that great I'm
gonna take a r 39 and D in the purple
shade right here like there's no
transition shade in these palettes and
that's okay cuz it's just like literally
three color so you know it's supposed to
be like a really simple palette for
everyday look I mean the color does have
some pigment to it it just feels a
little bit dry when blending it out so
it definitely doesn't feel like a like a
complete crap i shadow but it's not my
favorite I'm gonna try to do somewhat of
a simple eye look since you know you
don't have that much to work with here
so I'm just gonna be honest like I don't
love these eye shadows so I'm not gonna
recommend these to you the foundation I
think looks pretty the blush looks
really pretty
we'll continue to see so on and so forth
the powder felt really nice as well this
color just I really want to put on my
eyelid but it's like almost nothing
comes off it's almost irritating so I'm
gonna put a little bit I'm gonna put a
little bit of this light shade and the
eyeball in my eyeball on my eye lid with
my finger I just feel like the bronze
clay wouldn't really match the purple
alright this is really a simple - shadow
eye look I'm gonna pop them on the brow
bone as well but a very simple look you
can even do this for everyday if you
want it to but now I'm gonna try out
some of their liner I got the nourishing
eye liner it says it resists fading and
smearing I like it I got the shade soft
black
and it comes off really creamy so I do
like that it even yeah it goes in the
waterline super nice so liner I don't
know how well it lasts but it goes on
really creamy and nice next up we have
their mascara it's a nourishing mascara
to test out and it says this will be
longer lashes definition instantly and I
also got this one in the shade but
there's a 100% natural here's what the
one looks like it's one of those spiky
little plastic ones
it feels really sticky it feels kind of
dry I'm not gonna lie like it's not like
going on the lashes very well it
definitely builds up so I would say like
there's some volume with the mascara I
think that the mascara is somewhat
thickening and I don't think it lifted
my lashes a lot but most mascaras don't
because I wear false lashes every day so
it cost my life just to grow downward
and it's super annoying but I do feel
like the WOM because it was like prickly
in plastic that it didn't separate the
lashes as it was thickening them so they
didn't get too clumpy so I don't I do
like the mascara is it like
life-changing no but it is like a nice
mascara would that being said I might
add some false lashes I'm gonna take it
in for a brush in the shade and we're
gonna apply it to the lower lash line
and just buff it out I did purchase a
Burt's Bees lip stick and this one is
called suede splash which just look a
pretty spicy warm nude color let's see
how it looks on the lips I always start
my videos with a little bit of looked
like chapstick stuff on
lipstick is really pretty and it's
really full of pigment it is a shiny
finish which is very pretty not
typically what I go for on the norm the
next one I got one I'm gonna try out is
now nude which is a pretty lights her
nude shade this shade has like some
shimmer in it it's just interesting it
looks like a gloss a mousse which this
one I like better out of the two I think
it's really pretty
so I also bought a gloss and I'm
actually trying out for shits and
giggles this is called autumn haze it
does look really pretty it's like a lip
topper Emma's got so much sparkle and
shine in it gonna be strong Oh open very
light and natural and the gloss does not
feel sticky at all which I'm like
therefore all right guys this is our
final look what do you guys think about
the makeup will you be purchasing Burt's
Bees makeup have you purchased it what
do you think about it leave that
conversation in the comments section
right down below also let me just give a
really quick rundown foundation I like
it I would say light to medium coverage
I haven't won it all day but as for I'll
put in the description box my fillings
on it and how it wears all day so we'll
have this on all day really really like
the mattifying face powder I love the
blush I do not recommend the eyeshadows

okay and the eyeliner was really nice so
