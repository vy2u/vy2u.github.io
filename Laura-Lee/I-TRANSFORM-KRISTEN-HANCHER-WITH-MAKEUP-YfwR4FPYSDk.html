really dry to you absolutely like around
my mouth I like right through here I'm
so Olli oh my and I my forehead but then
the rest of my face will be peeling skin

thing it takes a lot of time but mean
like did you just learn you've obviously
been doing this for a while yeah it's
just kind of like I've been doing it for
so long that it's just like easy now but
it used to take me like so long to do
like a 15 second clip and like what is
my life yeah okay I'm gonna go in with
the NARS creamy radiate concealer what

the tart shape tape but it's not in
Sephora you only still at it all time

what's your favorite thing about
yourself is first feature I don't know I
mean when I okay I don't like my brows
without makeup but I like how I do like
my it's the way they grow yes so it's
super tweezed up right now because I
tweeze them yesterday and the way I like
to do my brows is like super like sharp
like Instagram kind of brow love it
so I over tweeze on purpose so I can
make those lines like you know that make
sense though yeah but when I grow them
out they're like oh my God thank you
she despised my brows because I
literally have to create a brow that's
not there like I have to mold my face
right you have a good eye shape thank
you
I do I feel like lucky with that eye
shape mm-hmm cake and bake 350 degrees
over here so when did you learn to do
make up cuz useful a make up oh my god
okay so I used to do dance competitions
when I was little my mom used to do my
makeup when I was super little like I
cannot keep doing this cuz her she could
not do makeup whatsoever so I learned
when I was like eight years old just to
be more like my dad's competition makeup
like lashes red lipstick like this is
where the dancing comes from Oh
musically then yeah I mean I speaking
better of dancer and do like flips and
all that like I could do like back
what's in there and all that but like
now I can't
that's not really cool I can tell you
mm-hmm thank you so guys I mean because
I'm like texta playing the collab and
now each other day before uh yeah the
day before
didn't say I was like behind her in line
we were getting our tickets and all like
yeah like how did this happen there's
like 10,000 the others had to be right
behind each other yes is insane
did you see your movie well maybe just
think in Winchester I mean you know I
mean I'm a horror movie fanatic so I
yeah the sprit as that it's like you
like to see the good stuff yeah it was
just so boring and like a long day how
was Black Panther Rose everything it was
so good I've always tried like the nose
contour thing but I'm never good at it
so what I do is I just take like a light
like a light brown eyeshadow and I just
go at like the bridge of my nose like
right here and it makes it look like
kind of like a sweet blushing so long so
I'm like I been neglecting it and then I
watched checkland hill video she's such
a little person you'll love her she
seems like she's she's lovely a best
person yeah I adore her
peach girl she's the talker Hey
Oh God lovely sure yeah oh my god this

meant oh no no no I'm so ready okay I've
never had someone transforming into like
glammed up you know like this is cool I
love it I love the color yes you can do
your transitions you're ducking out the
corner yes it's everybody laying so like
okay I just be like a total mackerel
when I was like little like something
like this door yeah like everything if
you had high and make up like it was Mac
and oh yes right that was like for
everyone though who's writing stuff over
by my like first Mac which is so worth
it it's so much money for lipstick but I
mean technically you know I was so young
- I do like say bubala oh me too me too
you and for whatever reason my first MAC
lipstick was candy yum yum which is neon
pee and I'm like I was so into like I'm

in candid I like I needed to live here
yeah opportunities are endless
oh my god I'm so excited yes oh yeah
it's a heavy price tag but looking at UM
the receipt and I'm like oh you're like
oh gosh how much excuse me Pepa grass
she don't win there yeah but it's it's a
good palette it like a muffin along its
shape
I just want to say like supercell when
people gave my line I'm never coming
lashes before what yeah I know I know so
many people do it I'm like you should is
that a thing go yes it honestly at the
long edge I yes so I always just cut you
know that little tip off and then I
always trim from the long edge only not
this so that's that part stays short
right it makes them so much more
comfortable to wear
okay and it makes it so much easier to
apply just a little wet okay they're so
pretty oh my god I love it
Wow I like fluffy at the end so they're
like actually I'm wearing them I'm
wearing them right now yeah you don't
really know they're like super sexy oh
wow no I love it I think they make the
eyes look so flirty yeah awesome girl oh
I saw that in so many videos like oh yes
right and I put it on my cheeks and my
chin and my nose my forehead and then
with my blinding eye light I just do the
tip of the nose and the cheekbones it
just gives me like that glow and like ha
blowing everywhere yeah I'm really extra
with it I feel like no one else does
that oh this is so cute yes maybe this
one a little bit nicer this one is
stripped oh I love stripped so much from
ABH
