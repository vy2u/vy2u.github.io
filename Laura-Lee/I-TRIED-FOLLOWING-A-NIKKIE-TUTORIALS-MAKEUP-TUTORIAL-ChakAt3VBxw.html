channel today's video is going to be I
follow blinks makeup tutorial and as you
saw from the title of this video I was
gonna try to like surprise and I realize
you guys would see the time now entitled
it's negative I have decided to
challenge myself because me and Nicki
have a different face shape and we also
have a different nose izybelle like my
eyes are very rounded and she has like a
lot of space between her brow and
lyddite it's a different eyeball but I'm
gonna try really hard Nicki is so
talented she was like the tutorial Queen
on the internet hello her name is Nicki
tutorials I want to take on the
challenge and try obviously these videos
are going around and I want to try
probably won't turn out identical
because again we have a very different
face shape but I think I can do it and
I'm gonna put my best foot forward and
try really hard to recreate a makeup
look I'm very nervous I literally just
went on snapchat I need to get over it
and do it so I'm excited to be doing
this today I hope you guys are excited
for it also I'm not gonna lie I land it
like midnight last night from Chicago
and this morning I'm waking up and
filming and I am tired do I look tired
don't answer that thank you kind sir hey
some water and a face mask but we're
gonna go ahead and in Jesus sweet Jesus
we're gonna go ahead and jump right into
this video may all the makeup gods me
with me and Nicki if you're in here
around here somewhere help without
further ado let's go ahead and jump rain
also just jumping right in the video me
and Nikki have very different makeup
techniques so I'm really interested to
see like how my makeup works out using
Nikki's techniques and makeup I don't
think there's anything wrong with either
of our techniques I think they're just
different so I'm excited to start a hem
alone mirror here and oh I need to have
the video playing so we can go step by
step hello I'll find the video I'm gonna
be doing the how to slay your holiday
makeup one I feel she did a really
pretty Nikki it's a very intricate but
not too intricate but kind of intricate
it's a look that I typically wouldn't do
and that's why I chose it let me put
that way and everything I wouldn't do
this way it's because this look because
my eye shape but I'm gonna do it because
I want to challenge myself okay Nikki is
first applying a Mac strobe cream to her
face oh my gosh and then she puts that
honey
London drops within the stroke cream and
then shakes a brush all right Nikki
that's a lot I like the tiniest head
ever you ever meet me you'll get to
admire how small my head is small it's
too small for my body okay and then she
put the iconic London drops on her face
but she just went I've never done this
before I've never put these on my face
before foundation I think she just did
that yeah oh no she puts them right here
I thought so
oh my face right here oh my god I'm
nervous about these now okay I've never
done this before this is new territory
for me and then she took a little brush
and blended it out so I'm just gonna
take it oh my god I'm nervous I'm like
what turn out okay
maybe she's testing out an Instagram
technique whoa her forehead is shiny
well I have never looked more Lumi in my
life so next up would be foundation
foundation today I'm gonna be going in
with the hood a beautiful filter in the
color angel food and mixing it in with a
drop of Shu a okay I have the two
foundation and she mixes together I'm
gonna use cheesecake and I think
actually she's kid I may use cheesecake
in latte so she basically does mostly
Hooda and then she adds in a drop of the
issue a foundation so she is a very full
coverage girl as am i Nicki maybe just
like a touch more full coverage than me
I've never mix these two together I
don't know what's gonna happen but her
makeups always flawless so I'm trusting
the technique on this end of the sponge
first that's right girl that's right I'm
actually gonna use a lot of foundation
because Nicki that's just her technique
you know nothing wrong with it by the
way I haven't watched one of these
videos yeah like if I'm gonna do a video
challenge like I like to do it and then
watch the challenges may not be the
smartest thing in the world to do but I
just don't want to I just want to be
very much my own you know
um so I'm assuming this how other people
are doing this they're just literally
putting them on the screen which is what
I'm gonna do I'm actually watching it
for my phone right now so I'm just like
assuming I'm doing this right I think
this is the concealer she uses soft
matte complete concealer this is what
she uses so I'm gonna you shade medium
one I do love this concealer and I'm
from
with it she first applies it to her face
with like a smaller brush and then goes
in with that sponge and blend it out
which is different from me you guys know
I put it on I normally do my liquid
concealer and then put it on and then
blend it out with my wife 6 but you know
I'm not using the y6 today because this
is an M 4 3 6 brush next up she just
takes the fit me setting powder and sets
everything so that is exactly what I'm
gonna be using all you shade number 10
fair light and she just dips the
dampened sponge and the powder which is
often times what I do alright here is
the palette she used the morphe dare to
create 39a palette and she starts off
with this color right here um this
palette is no longer for sale so I feel
bad using it and normally get a lot of
kickback whenever I use things in my
tutorials that are no longer for sale so
I was just gonna say the 24 g is for
sale and it does have a similar brown
color in it that I can use as well so
that way you guys can kind of follow the
look and still get still get the look
with us in my affordable palette I'm
gonna take out our 39 brush she doesn't
start with the transition shade which is
totally fine people do that all the time
I typically do so like I said this is
like a way that that is just like a
different technique for me to learn oh
okay let's do it oh my god I'm so scared
of her the best
I'm gonna quit being a wuss I'm gonna
stamp this color on my eye
I'm gonna take that exact shade bear on
this little tiny brush and I might try
to clean up and soften out those edges
this is gonna be a horizontal spotlight
smokey eye so next up I need to find a
perfect brush to do which I think I'm
gonna use actually I'm think I'm gonna
use this tiny little lip brush I think
it's just gonna do better on my smaller
eyelid to carve out that Center and I'm
just gonna use a cream concealer from
NARS I feel like I did a pretty good job
of doing the spotlight part I should be
really different than hers and this is
for I feel like the look it's gonna be a
wee bit different but I'm gonna try my
hardest to make it the same but I take
it in three at to six brush like she
took a little brush went back in with
the brown color and she said she kind of
wanted to make this part like a brown
liner at the base of the eye
I'm gonna go in with that green gold
shimmer just like she used and I'm just
gonna pack it on the spotlight area but
she left the very top corner of the
spotlight area without any eye shadow so
what happens I definitely don't think it
looks identical this is frustrating cuz
I don't have the pigment that she is but
I have a very similar one I'm gonna
apply right there and the crease that we
left that spot we left to open next up
she sets her waterline with a black
eyeliner and if you're wondering Wanda's
eyes playing this because I got pissed
off at that eye and took off all the
makeup something off-camera and she
added some black shadow from the palette
along the lower lash line which I
typically on my island my eye shape was
so rounded and like I don't know I'm
such a big eyes that whenever I add too
much darkness on the lower lash lines my
eye down but I'm gonna do it for six of
the videos in hopes that it will turn
out good and then I'm gonna take evolve
which is the same brown color from the
palette and smoke out the lower lash
line
and then I'm gonna apply some similar
lashes to the one that she used in the
tutorial in this video Nikki mix this
together hula light which is why do you
light for me so I'm going to use regular
hoola and then the bronzing powder from
Tom Ford
that is gold dust so I'm going to mix
them together and bronze up my skin then
she took the kylie blush which I don't
have bad either so I'm gonna take this
blush from the balm
this one's called hot mama it's really
pretty really pinky very similar color
to the Kylie blush and with the Ã¬iÃ®
blush brush angled brush before
everything is wrong that I'm saying I'm
gonna apply this to the apples of my
cheeks and then I'll go ahead and buff
it on backwards and like Nicki I'm going
to take my sponge and carve out the
cheeks so here I go
and then she goes in with glazed
doughnut which I'm going to try a little
bit of this one but really like her my
skin tone
we definitely have a different skin tone
I'm a little bit more medium she's a
little bit more light it's okay we're
gonna work it out
well that shade is light but I wanted to
try it in honor of Nikki and I'm just
gonna buff away all that excess powder
that's baking on my face for lips she
went in with buff from UA and then she
put papaya on top so I'm gonna do the
same it's a really pretty lip combo
which I haven't really tried out I'm
gonna let that dry and then I'll add
some gloss on like she did I don't have
the exact gloss that she had it but I
have a very similar one but doesn't mean
time she did set her makeup with the all
nighter setting spray from every case
I'm gonna go ahead and do that as well
okay and this is the final look think
the look is identical to Nikki's but I
think it is super close and I think it
turned out really really pretty despite
our makeup techniques are different and
I typically wouldn't have done to make
it this way I really like her technique
and I think it worked out really well
and I'm super happy I got to try it
so thank you Nikki for honoring us with
such great tutorials but I like the
makeup look and I hope you guys like it
too I know I don't look identical to
Nikki but I tried really hard and I
think it still turned out very pretty so
