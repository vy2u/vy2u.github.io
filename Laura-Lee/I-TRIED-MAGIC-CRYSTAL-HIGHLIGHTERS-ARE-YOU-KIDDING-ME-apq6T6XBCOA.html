magical rocks gimmicky okay okay he shot
it early today
he shot that gimmicky GI mmm I seek a
gimmick what is up everyone
today's video is going to be on these
don't even know what they're called this
gemstone highlighter so these are
magical crystal that's good these are
gonna be magical crystal fantasy
highlighters these just randomly came in
to be are from me and don't know I've
never heard of this website
what's that day peridot cosmetics calm
launches summer 2018 and you can
pre-order these so basically these are
magic crystals that come in these little
velvet containers I would call it and
are highlighters and then on the back it
tells you like no but you can go down
nova is rose gold highlighter this
swatch is like gold perfect for all
complexions cruelty free it's rose
quartz and love much love and compassion
so they're magical crystals like I just
said I'm basically reviewing the product
and the intro and I don't know why I'm
doing that so when I open them up I'm
gonna try them out I'm gonna I'm gonna
tell you the tea I'm gonna dig through
the rocks and see on the good stuff oh
and I'm gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE song
and then we're gonna jump into the video
and do the damn thing okay be sure
yeahmy subscribe to work the whole time
okay now we're gonna go ahead and jump
right into the video
okay guys here they are I have all of
them there is a total of five and they
come in these up I dropped one so
there's five of them one two three four
five they come in these some velvet
little jars they're made out of
cardboard I believe and they
I totally showed you guys the sheet in
the beginning of the video we have
different crystals yeah no it says like
pre-order and stuff like that so when I
open the first one the first one I have
here is Phoenix Phoenix is adorned what
is this load of light crystal use for
manifestation okay here we go
this one is a light brown highlighter oh
my goodness it's just so crazy okay so I
already see an issue with this whenever
I put the lid on like it's all in the
lid and I feel like it's like coming out
of the brim of the jar so whenever I do
this yeah the product I don't know if
you guys can see that yeah you can see
it okay it's kind of like exploding
everywhere it's on my hand so a little
bit of a faulty container if it had a
filter on it you probably wouldn't be
able to tap into the rock so I can see
why they didn't put a filter on it but I
don't know it's like it's too full or
something like that
the next one we have is Nova and that is
the court so it's love and compassion Oh
zoom in again ty oh yeah this one looks
pretty pretty cool oh girl let's clean a
crystal off and see wow it is a little
quartz crystal do you see that Wow catch
it your mouth and eat it
he missed okay next we have Phoebe wait
no what's that's a tie right it's a gold
stone and it's strengthens your inner
self granny all the strength I can get
so I don't slap a ho okay here we go
ooh this one's brown maybe a little
deeper skin tone this might look nice on
I would like to show you guys when you
close it you end up with a bit of a mess
so there's that next up we have what's
that Orion used to bring success and
happiness well girl I'm already
successful and happy in my book so why
not have more other Orion Wow this one
looks so fascinating Phoenix Phoebe I
have no idea that's right but this one
looks really pretty
I know Luna Luna is quartz crystal
strengthen and clarity of the mind this
one almost looks purple it is I'm
inhaling highlighter so my poop is gonna
be very pretty okay this is Luna so now
you have an overview of each one I'm
going to try them on my face face face
first I'm gonna add a little bit of
powder see we're gonna take all that
glow away so we can see how these are
gonna work
I'm gonna try Nova which is the pinky
one we're gonna put my little brush to
the test now this here is the r36 brush
if you don't own this I'm not sure what
you're putting highlighter on with but
it's probably wrong okay so here I go oh
look it like cleans off the crystals you
can see the crystal is better
it was like rock candy okay here I go
Wow look good you better shut up Wow
hi my heart is melting girl Tai what do
you think no these are amazing okay
let's do another one oh yeah this is the
one I want to try okay I want to try out
Orion which is the yellow gold oh I
breathe just everywhere let's see what
these crystals look like these are like
a darker gray okay here we go I can't
see myself in the viewfinder when I look
this way which makes me annoyed because
I like to look at myself
well the highlighter is blinding though
in it
Wow wanna Ryan we are living the fantasy
okay
loves it so far it's just to me I'm
having fun with it
it is very messy I am breathing it in
and is in my hair but I'm still having
fun with it and I am blinding people so
that is the overall goal here now I want
to try Phoenix on my nose
oh no we don't not one I probably can't
use cuz probably let you deep for me
that's okay okay so ty is actually gonna
take Phoenix because I won't be able to
use this one anyways and he's gonna wash
the rocks off and we're gonna actually
look at the rocks without the
highlighter Thank You assistant oh my
god okay they're on one Phoebe is really
dark now I'm going to take the purple
one which is Luna actually I'm gonna put
this on my hand so Luna it looks like oh
wow it's a purple arrow doesn't it oh
that's pretty girl I'm so shook you guys
are about to die these are like
literally little gems you get it at a
craft store and you put a necklace on
they all have holes in them for you to
put a necklace on tied get the zoom in
here girl wait basically what I figured
out is that this is a homemade situation
I think
there was no you know carton with this
product and it literally doesn't have
the ingredients our shades were vegan
except for Nova which plays carmine in
it it says the Jules can be used in a
variety of different things that's just
a core meditation or joy so it looks
like they bought jewelry stones and put
a highlighter on top of it which is an
interesting concept because every stone
has a hole in it and you know how you
can go to like Michael's and buy or
order off like Amazon like big bags of
crystals and they're like got little
holes and I mean you can like make it
necklace or do whatever with it kind of
feels like this company may have just
been dumping bags of crystals into
little containers and putting actually a
really pretty loose highlighter on them
Wow
yeah so I don't know if this is an
actual crystal these are rocks but
they're like so if you can see what I'm
saying these just this is this came out
with the rose gold one the rose quartz
but you see I'm saying it has like a
hole and everyone where it's literally
just like I don't know I bet I could
find these online like I don't know what
do you guys think leave me a comment am
I crazy but I think these are just
little rocks you get wholesale and if
you can see I can tell all of the
crystals have the little holes so it's
like the same situation how much are
they oh girl that is too much for this
because a it's a mess be it's homemade
it doesn't even have does it have an
ingredients list on it ingredients mica
titanium dioxide iron axe oxide so
there's three ingredients like I really
think this is a homemade thing and it's
32 bucks like that's a very expensive
guy so it's very pretty though like the
highlighter it definitely works it works
very well you do get your little
crystals you can make a necklace with it
so I'm putting the information out there
and you guys can decide for yourself if
it is worth it for you
for me I really do like the highlight I
got
say like I'll probably use these again
because I highlight so pretty but just
because I know that it is kind of
homemade it does make me skeptical on
wanting to spend that much money on it I
know how much it costs to be in labs and
things like that and those costs
probably aren't in this product so why
does it cost that much that's my only
thing that makes me even more skeptical
about these so I did actually go ahead
and swatch Phoenix Phoenix peanuts yeah
and it is a very pretty bronzy golden
color my review is that I love the
highlighters I think they're all really
beautiful I do think they're homemade I
do think they cost a little too much so
there are some skeptics but I feel like
i repeating myself now I probably am but
yeah I don't know have you guys ever
even heard of this company have you guys
even heard of any of this go what's the
T well that's my super short show
because how can I put highlighter on you
okay they do have an Instagram account
with 5,000 followers it does like they
have like some pictures taking of the
product they do have some people they
shout out that are using the product so
I don't know guys Oh disclaimer we post
amazing makeup looks it doesn't mean
they're wearing our product china town
well that's already weird that's kind of
weird that they post like a bunch of
girls wearing highlighters but at least
they just claimed that it's not theirs I
just want to say Laura one time filmed
full face full of liquid lipsticks in
that capacity go ahead and turn for the
audience look at that pretty skin look
at it and ready
don't you have to put like a base that I
saw you putting a base down on yours but
all of a sudden I want to go straight
onto my face no I'll drop in stones
woman you're my shine off with
mattifying powder here we go maybe I
need shine let me look let me look at
you it's hard honey look at your face in
the viewfinder you see it yeah I look
greasy girl you like a glazed
whoa okay I'm not done yet
I think I know but I'm gonna do this one
on you Dark Phoenix you get punched in
the face it's not for you let me put
that so we read I know we're gonna put
some rose gold on your nose I love it
you look good all right when I'm in
public you're welcome I look good I know
this looks like it has that facetune
white over facetune nose doesn't it what
does that mean you know what I mean
didn't it look it has like I tuned my
nose tuned it or like you just bumped up
the exposure too much people tune their
noses white yeah it's a highlight
another thing all right so let's close
