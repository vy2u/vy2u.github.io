today's video I'm going to be filming
with the one only life's a drag but but
here is Manny mu A's first product from
his makeup line I'm so happy and proud
of him and this is his eyeshadow palette
that he came out with it is a girl
where's that brush let me get it
together
put that in there real quick this is the
life's of direct palette so this is a
drag queen themed palette mini has a
drag makeup on in the front picture and
that's why it's called life's a drag and
then in the palette you have half
neutrals half colors and then two
shimmers in the center and all the names
of the shade are really cute they're
like drag queen themed and then you get
a double in it
brush with a mirror and it says it be a
queen my mears a little dirty girls I've
been using her oh actually this is a
color palette this launches on 6 - so
guys be sure and check it out at lunar
beauty and dot-com and I'm so happy and
proud of me mani he works so freaking
hard on this and I know how excited he
is and how proud he is and how proud I
am of this product as well it looks so
amazing girl okay the theme of this
video is me using every color of the
palette and I probably picked one of the
hardest palettes to do that with and I
did it on purpose because I wanted to
challenge myself and I really wanted to
show you guys the variety so this
challenge is gonna be very hard and I
like I don't even know what's gonna
happen I don't even know if it's gonna
turn out good girl this is the intro
like I haven't practiced it I don't know
we're in this together oh they are gonna
think this up so long and then we'll
jump right be sure and subscribe yeah we
and now let's go ahead and jump right
into this video okay so I'm really
nervous to even start this look because
every color matters that I put on my eye
but I'm gonna go ahead stop being a wood
oh yeah
okay all the team I'm gonna start with
just a little bit of sickening and hunty
I'm gonna mix them together one's a
cooler tone brown ones a little bit of a
richer carmely
Brown I'm taking our 39 brush a little
bit more of those colors so they're
mixed together and I'm just blending
them in the crease I don't want to use a
lot of these Browns because the look
it's gonna be rather colorful but this
is a nice base for us to put down first
that's just what we all do I'll do it
over here
so if used two of the color so far
granted these are the easiest colors to
use so we're starting out like we're
done okay I'm really feeling like I can
do this now I'm gonna go in with campi
which is our yellow shade I'm just gonna
work this a little bit higher up that's
so pretty it's like a little sunshine
that farted on my eye well I'm sitting
here blending I figure like why not chow
with you guys and I just want to say
this like I in this beauty community
like there's just always so much
negativity and drama but I gotta say
this but I'm gonna go in with Chi Chi
anyone I created my own makeup line and
it's very hard it's not an easy thing to
create like whenever you go and doing
these things makeup is about this big of
it and then the rest it's like all the
business behind it and the taxes and the
website and the forms and the
trademarking like it's health then you
get you know judged by millions of
people on what you worked on for so long
it's hard you know so just I mean I
can't force people to be positive but I
think like the negative bullcrap should
be cut out and I would like to see more
positivity and more people it's hard
because I know people don't like realize
what it's like to create something big
as a makeup line they have no idea and
so it's really easy for them just to pop
those comments off because all they see
is the product but it's very difficult
and I don't know you just if people knew
I feel like they wouldn't be so
harsh all the time you know is what it
is but I just want to let you guys know
that
kudos to anyone who has started a makeup
line because I know what it's like and
it's very Hardy you gotta be a tough
person to do it and you gotta be a very
hard worker to do it so anyone that has
is a hard worker and I just wanna send
that positivity to them and congratulate
them and just know that you know they're
doing great girl you got a makeup line
you didn't know something right because
it ain't easy they go in with our bright
purple right here that is pigmented
honey
I've already used five shades on my eyes
and I just wanna say that I'm a crowd of
mops so now I'm gonna take my Mac Paint
Pot and soft ochre looks like this I've
been using this for years and years and
I'm gonna go ahead and carve out the
front of my eye so we can do a real cold
look go ahead and just carve out this I
leave and then I'm gonna go in with cake
face okay it's teeny tiny this is a
morphe and seven in 170 brush going in
with cake face which is the white shade
I'm going it to you get a mirror so I
can see what the hell I'm doing now I
want to go in with key key which is the
mint shade and I'm using the same little
detail brush detail tiny brushes are so
good for moments like this when you want
to get creative and do a cool look
because they help shadow not to just
fling everywhere and you have a party on
your face I'm just gonna press this mint
shade right where I finished off the
white shade I do have a few more
neutrals I have three more neutrals and
two shimmers that I still have to use
and I have no idea what I'm gonna do
with them
now I'm gonna take fishy which is our
blue if she's kind of like a sigh and it
has like this slight shimmer to it so
I'm gonna go ahead and damp it a little
bit with some wonder beauty and mist let
me get some water cuz I'm sweating over
here nervous so right now I'm blending
fishy into the purple and then I'm gonna
blend it into the mint a little bit girl
this starting to look like constructive
clown makeup and I ain't mad at it this
is like such tiny detailed work like
normally my looks obviously I normally
gonna use 14 shades for look but that's
part of the challenge we might look
complicated so I could go in I'm being
like so meticulous you guys know what's
this like ice cream on my eyes I don't
know does this look good or like silly I
don't know I'm gonna have to use this
snatched color which is a reddish color
it's like a deeper red and I feel like
the only way to really use that is
because this colors are deeper out here
like that's that's the place she gonna
have to put it run out space to put
colors so I have some snatched girl I
was going to use my phone hello hi okay
so I think I'm gonna like just build up
this outer corner with Snatcher oozy
which I do like how that's looking okay
so I have officially want add it a
little bit of the red but I kind of want
to go back in with a little bit of Chi
Chi and just pink it up just a tiny bit
what I'm finding to be the most hard is
like not losing the color because I'm
building on so many colors I feel like
I'm losing a little bit of the purple
and pink now I have these three colors
to use and then these two as well I'll
know what I'm gonna do with that gold
well I know I can go ahead and you shady
the black color kind of like a liner and
go ahead and line the eye with it so
that is pretty easy that's like a
no-brainer it's a really nice black
color has lots of pigment in it it was
like ice cream or cotton candy on my
eyes so what I'm gonna do now take shade
and mug and I'm going to mix them
together on this little brush shade it's
like a deep maroon mug it's like a dark
brown I'm just gonna have to blend these
mixed together from this outer corner
right here and just bring it around the
town but I'm only gonna go half way and
then I'm gonna take beat width which is
our little lighter shimmery color and
I'm gonna go ahead and pop that in the
inner corner look that is Barratt like a
diamond I'm gonna go ahead and put beat
on my brow bone and my kind of thing I
want to do the wing but I'm nervous I'm
gonna screw up at all oh I think the
wing gives it a nice touch I've
officially used every single color in
this palette
except for legendary and if we're being
real legendary is the typical Orly color
so you guys should be proud of me so now
I'm gonna have to take legendary I'm
gonna pop it like right in there oh I'm
gonna go ahead and curl my lashes and
I'm gonna put on some Miami from little
lashes also I put some white powder down
just because I use literally 14 shades
so I did have a little bit of sprinkles
of color so I just clean it up a little
bit and put on
powder oh I'm so hungry ocher my stomach
is growling I don't know if you guys can
hear it you guys don't know how to apply
at false lashes I have a dedicated video
where I go very in-depth and show you
guys step-by-step how to apply them but
it takes some of the UM Radzi eggs oh
girl eggs honest Tasha highlight yeah
we're just gonna put this on I really
want more purple on my under I can't
believe I'm going back in with more
eyeshadows I'm just a little bit of
purple or lips I'm gonna use some of
Nike Nike my nudists liquid lipstick but
first I'm gonna line my lips with a
little bit of Sienna from su way that is
it for this video guys how do you think
I did I think I did the best that I
could and I think I have a super
gorgeous colorful eye yeah I love the
way it came out and I only took 14
shades to get it so anyways obviously
you can create a lot of amazing looks
those palette doesn't have to be 14
shades I think the palettes amazing
