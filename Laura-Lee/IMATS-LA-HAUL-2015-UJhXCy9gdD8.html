different from last year last year I

this year I was able to go on pro night
and actually pick out stuff that I
actually wanted it was amazing I just
wanted to say before this video starts

ahead and skip this part but if not I
just wanted to say really quickly on
these past two days
Saturday and Sunday today has you just
been beyond amazing to me I got to meet
so many of you guys and that is just
such an honor for me it really truly is
and I'm not just saying that because I
don't know like it truly comes from my
heart and I feel like I need to put it
in this video and for you guys to tell
me that you love my videos and that
you're watching me and you love my work
like that's why I do this the whole
reason I do YouTube is for you guys and
I have a great love and passion for
beauty I know a lot of you guys who are
religious followers am I know that
because I post so often and I do spend a
lot of time working on my videos I don't
like to post crap videos you know um so
I just really appreciate you guys coming
up to me oh you guys telling me I love
you you know I love you guys so much
like words cannot express the gratitude
that I have for you know your your
support like it's everything to me I
wish I could meet each and every one of
you and just hug you and thank you
personally but I am so grateful for the
ones of you that I got to meet thank you
for coming up to me thank you for saying
hello pictures hug love you guys so much
so now we're gonna jump into the hall
and let's get started Oh
to begin this hall we might as well
start with Matt because we all know I'm
a Mac fanatic and of course I stopped at
this booth there was some good stuff
there first thing that I got from Mac
with a lipstick and I got kind of sexy
and what is so funny it's the woman
working the booth her makeup was just
like on point like beyond belief so I
it's just like it was on your lip she
was like
sexy throw it in the back what's on your
eyes this come throw it in the night
like whatever you're wearing I need
because you just look so beautiful right
now like I can't even stand it I'm a
best friends with one of the workers
they're so amazing the first one I got
was kind of sexy this is just a lipstick
color it is a mommy pink I did bye to
mommy pink colors because I'm a crazy
person but this one is a little bit more
but Browns home color I'm very pleased
with the color I am wearing this and
Cosma which is the next I'm gonna show
you right now on my lips and as you can
see it's just a beautiful Browns home
Bobby pink color so in style right now
like these colors are just popping so if
you're looking for one of those kind of
sexy would be perfection I mean I'll go
ahead and show you Cosmo because this
the other one I have all this one isn't
amplified and that one was a matte this
amplified lip color it's just beautiful
this is what you're seeing mostly
because I have kind of sexy on the
bottom and this on the top beautiful
color and as you can see this one's just
a little bit more pinky really excited
about those I bought a single eyeshadow
and this is what the woman had on her
eyes this is a pro color and this is
deep damson you guys know I love my warm
tone colors and then I love my Deep
Purple's like I wear Deep Purple's
probably every day I have brown eyes and
purples just set really well with brown
eyes so I tend to gravitate more towards
those but this is just an absolutely
beautiful color it is a pro color it
does glide on beautifully I am super
happy with it I'm wearing it a little
bit right now and I wore it right when I
bought it but you know how much girls do
then a new Paint Pot however I already
have this soft ochre and I bought a soft
ochre because mine's like kind of dry
and you know your Paint Pots gonna be
real smooth here we go now in a crusty
Paint Pot cuz what'd you think yeah
shadows gonna look like I gonna do one
about a fresh one and I am a painterly
girl I wear pain elite but it's more
browns home and I wanted something more
of a lighter tone for the brow bone area
because I like my eyebrow bones to be
like bling and so here is soft ochre
just a really light tone color and I'm
pretty much pumped about it so I might
start using this in my videos a little
bit more than
jonno painfully is much and then I got
to lip pencils the first one I got is
cork this looks like a scary brown pod
but really it's not
Oh have images I always eat and then
films hit society yes is a brownie color
it's not this dark I don't know Mac it
is a beautiful brown color the reason I
got this is because I like to line like
the corners of my lips a little bit with
it and then put on my lipstick and it
kind of gets like that ombre deepening
effect so I guess it is a little bit
dark but see it's like a lighter brown
color and this is like doodoo brown so I
don't know what's going on there but
anyway this is a great color to do that
with because it's not too dark I'm a
half chestnut by Mac and honestly
chestnut is more of a doodoo brown color
so that one's real dark and I use that
ones who like do the ombre effect
whenever I'm wearing like a dark color
like a red or maroon you know then I got
Thor which is just holly gennero marker
yes it's popular mommies are popular and
I have so many mommy color lipsticks
that I need it a really perfect good
mommy color pink mommy color lip liner
so sore is something I am definitely
been in the market for it is sold out
everywhere including online but I say
I'm just gonna write this on the sheet
and if they have it like mine and asking
like I'm just gonna put soar on the
sheet they have it it will be in the bag
if they don't well then it won't it was
in the bag so now we'll move on took
those up I saw this bag is like a
statement and I love her logo but we'll
move on from dose of colors if you guys
follow me on Instagram and Twitter you
saw my pictures from I met
I wore this lipstick and a lot of people
asked me even amber it was like what is
on your lips I was like yes girl it is
pinky promise by dose of colors your
best friend makes his stuff make it by
Anna who was an instagramer she created
lying DISA colors and it is on point
more than on point it is such a fabulous
line if you don't have any of their
lipsticks you need them you do like I
say you need a lot of stuff and I'm
telling you you you really
really need this stuff so this is pinky
promise that this hot hot pink color I
rocked it for the next party I rocked it
for IMATS and it was just like yes it
just flowed so here is it's a liquid
matte lipstick by the way next I got
another lipstick from them this is a
poise which is a pretty popular one and
it's a nudie color because I love my
nude you never have to mini this is like
a curly brown a nude I don't know I'm
really bad at explaining this color
right now but I think this is more of a
Browns whole nude um and it's beautiful
and does the colors are like the
creamiest softest lipsticks on the
planet next I got one of their new
highlighters three new highlighters out
and I did pick up one this one is in
peach glowed now they're highlighters
are more of a thick grain I guess you
could say like is um you know it's not
really fine grain it's more of a thicker
grain sparkle on your cheek I do
normally go for the fine grain sparkles
but it's how to switch it up a little
bit you know you gotta try a little bit
of everything and I love all of the
colors lip products oh I can't wait to
try this one this is my first one from
them it's like my first face product
from them and I'm really excited to try
it out it looks so beautiful when i
swatched it at the stand so I was like
give me dad I stopped at the Tarte
counter and just picked up one blush
which was so random but I was just like
standing there and I was just like you
know I picked that blush there you wanna
you wanna ring me up for that one blush
so random but I did pick it up this
blush is in dazzled and guys guess how
much I paid for this blush ten freakin
dollars I should have all more this is
that's the price of one mac eyeshadow
like this crazy but I was just I don't
know I saw it there swatch didn't liked
it and now it's mine but it's just a
pretty bobby pink color as everything is
the tybalt I'm excited to try it and I
love my blushes they're in my pinup
girls heart palette so know I'm gonna
love this then I went to the Namie's
booth which I mean I have a discount
there but you know we got many in Los
Angeles did get something special that
I'm so excited about is the soulmates
Too Faced bronzer it's soap
Oh like I'm so excited about this
brother right now this bronzer gives me
life look at it
it's so pretty
like I don't honestly know if I can use
it because look at that rippling I don't
want to destroy that and that is so
beautiful but this just looks like like
a bronze goddess yes you guys probably
paid 20 bucks for this amazing yeah
you're all obsessed right now so this
one is in Rose and Rachel then I went to
the Mehran booth and I just want to give
you guys like the quickest rundown ever
on Mara and it was basically costume
like neurons been around since makeups
been around it's a good brand and really
hasn't been had that much love in the
YouTube community but it's been around
forever and basically they did all the
makeup for Broadway stars and then the
makeup was just such strong staying
power and coverage power that they
brought it out to the public and started
making things usable for everyday people
so you guys know I love me some cream
contour and highlight yes and I don't
have a cream contour and huh well I have
a BH one that's like four years old and
needs to go in the garbage can so I got
this one from Iran and it is so nice
like this is just beautiful the array of
colors are amazing if you're a freelance
makeup artist I would definitely try out
mehron for my people this beauty to me
because I love sculpting out my face and
doing all that fun stuff I just did the
video on it using drugstore products but
um I can't wait to stick my little
fingers and these okay another great
product from them is their setting
powder and now this stuff like if you
holy skin holy moly if you have six
different color ones but I got the
banana color of course because I am more
of an all of these skin tone they have
one for pinkies skin tones have
translucent they are all kinds of colors
both fine grain it feels like talc you
know how it's how powder just feels like
silk that's exactly what this feels like
so amazing so next I got their makeup
remover and cleanser which I heard that
stuff's supposed to be amazing so
there's that and then I got their eye
primer and then I also got one of their
press
pigment so you know how Mac has the
press pigments well if they have them as
well and i swatched some of them and
just like the color payoff which is so
thick and heavy and blendable like it's
smooth out i got blocked because i don't
have a single black eyeshadow and i know
that sounds crazy but I literally do not
have one single black achos that's what
I got her on and I also just stopped by
the Beautyblender booth which I did that
last year and this guy's looking kind of
rough so I picked up two more it was 24
- what just normally 24 one so I need
just a beauty blender i just got four
pair of lashes from Coco I'm cooking
lashes and I saw what would Lizzie do
like what would Lizzie do in line and
she was like these lashes are bomb so I
got four pairs for 20 and they remind me
a lot of House of lashes but such a good
deal on them I also picked up a Z
palette and I just need a once I don't
own a Z palette which is weird I know
but I use my Mac I should have packed
palettes to put my makeup week actually
does it I'm gonna transfer them over and
then I'm gonna start a new MAC eyeshadow
