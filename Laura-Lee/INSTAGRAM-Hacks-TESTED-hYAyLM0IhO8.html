video is gonna be super fun because
we're gonna be testing out Instagram
hacks also I want to thank smash arts
are partnering with me for this video
what I said over there is to map for me
to demo out in this video I show you
guys how to use it as one of the hacks
you'll see that in a minute you've
already seen this on my channel before
so you're very familiar with it but um I
love Smashbox is one of the brands have
been using since the beginning of my
time in Nick about their products for a
long time and this just suck is super
exciting for me the objects I'm sure
have you've been scrolling through your
Instagram feed you see packs of people
are doing over and over and over and you
have to wonder does this stuff really
work because some of it I don't even
know if it really works some of the
hacks I've tried out and put on my
Instagram and they do work but some I
haven't tried out yet and that's we're
gonna do in this video we're gonna test
them and see if they work if they don't
work you will know if they do work you
will know we sure to subscribe to my
channel before you leave I post lots of
fun things like this on my channel and
you do not want to miss out on it okay
subscribe button if you want to it's
kind of do you jump right in the video
and get started let's test out these
hacks I'm a big fan of cut creases and a
lot of people on instagram are using
spoons to get their cut great I really
think this is gonna work because I know
how I like to create my cut crease and I
just don't see it working out as great
with a spoon I'm low-key scare to try
this also gonna take a little bit of a
lighter cream shade eyeshadow to lighten
up the base to make the cut crease work
out even better so I'm giving this the
benefit of the doubt by doing this try
to apply the spoon the way the cut
crease would go I don't want my cut
crease to go like a straight line out
let me going in with this lovely color
which is a color from a project that I'm
working on which you will know about
very soon and I'm just gonna blend the
color oh God hmm gonna blend it out
nicely
this is what I thought would happen
it looks like ah I'm gonna have to say
this hag is a no for me definitely not
how I want to create cut crease to look
I think it all depends on the shape of
your eyes boom doesn't fit for
everybody's eye you like ty agreed to
let me shave his head for this part so
I'm just gonna shoot when we trying out
a hack that I need a head for it and I
can't use my own and it's a hack testing
all over Instagram where like hair
stylist will stick a comb in the hair
and just run a razor through it and
strike the hair off you actually saw
Natalie's outlet do this hack and it
didn't really work out for her I am
using like hair extensions so this
supposed to be like real hair remedy so
we're gonna see how it works out yes way
there I am dying
oh my god you pullin it sorry please
please please do not shave my real hair
okay I'll try that is my only request so
they're taking the comb like this and
just go in here oh sorry my gosh I'm
nervous here we go
oh god oh dude it worked oh so good
Tyler promise you just work like a
chance oh you said to take it a little
bit slower okay I feel like you should
let your hair cutter do your hair I
didn't hold the comb very evenly yeah
I'm trimming you up alright I'm
officially here stuff slay beautiful
good bang
love it thank you all right so here is
the Instamatic hack I'm gonna test out
how this works out I'm going to using
the be legendary lipstick from them it
looks like this it's the first time I
tried this shade this one is in famous
why am i whispering I'm whispering so
these have a more of a glossy finish so
what more of a perfect lipstick to try
it out with they're really creamy and
pigmented and I'm kind of dying right
now because I love the way this look
these have vitamin C and E and shea
butter NL so if you have dry lips these
are going to be good for you so now
we're gonna apply the instant matte this
is the lipstick transformer which is
supposed to turn all your creamy
lipsticks into a matte I'm doing a tube
obviously you see that and it also
supposed to help your lipstick to not
feather just apply it with your finger
so you'll just get a little bit when I
understand less is more with this stuff
and you just dot it on use this a horn I
did it with a brush and then I later
figured out the finger works ten times
better and that's it that's all you have
to do and you leave it and then there it
is you have matte lipstick like I said
you guys have seen this hat before on my
youtube channel where I showed you guys
how to make your lipstick matte it does
work it's a very easy way to transform
your lipstick from a cream to a matte so
voila our next up we're gonna be trying
out involves tape as well as eyeliner to
create the perfectly liner using tape I
wouldn't really recommend putting tape
on your eye you can do this whole thing
to make it not so sticky so it does it
for your skin but tape does have
chemicals in it that aren't really good
for your face so I mean that's a thought
some people don't care about all that
jazz those first I'm going to create
where we want my wing to be and then you
actually put a piece of tape across your
eyelid um to get like the Perot man
he's work that looks really nice
actually I have like my eyelid tape
we're is this something I'm willing to
do every day
absolutely not I mean what if like your
boyfriend walked out
I'm just gonna take a little bit my
Sigma wicked Joe whiner this is shade
black like your legit supposed to just
paint but I'm okay I don't know like
okay I'm doing it painting away now you
just remove the tape okay looks pretty
good right there
I think it's ripping out all my eyebrows
so I probably should have cut the tape
Oh brothers you to cut the tape to make
it thinner but my eyeliner um it appears
that it bled a little bit right here so
I'm gonna go ahead and say this hack is
way more trouble than what it's worth it
looks like I did my eyeliner with my
left hand and now I'm also missing
multiple eyebrow for our next hack our
beautiful model with her track showing
I'm going to test out the hack where
I've seen them wrap the hair on a pencil
or a metal pin I'm assuming a metal work
and then you clamp it with a
straightener and you get this tight
wound a cute little curl from the get-go
trying to write this hair on this little
pencil so many times it seems like it's
more trouble than what it's worth but I
have it tightly wounded please don't
burn me I won't burn you honey its
extensions so we're gonna clamp it I
have the glove on the rock just clamping
her oh God I'm just gonna close my head
don't be scared I don't think this works
I mean I'm clamping this sucker good too
so this doesn't work oh oh my god
beautiful it works it works better than
I could have ever imagined this working
I mean Tyler you do my okay look at this
guy's oh my god crazy it's crazy like
how good it works
metal pen I didn't use a wooden one I
used a metal one and put the glove on
the righthand all right so that's it for
this video I hope it was knowledgeable
and answered some of your questions on
if this stuff works cuz honestly I've
seen it over and over again and I'm like
does this work or is it just below me
hope you enjoyed the video I love you
