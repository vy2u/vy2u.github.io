hey guys welcome to my channel I look a
little crazy because I am a little crazy
kidding no I am crazy though today's
video is gonna be focusing on natural
makeup versus oh the Instagram glam I've
seen this video floating around I think
it's a really interesting concept and
look at the difference in my freaking
place oh tell me why this eye looks huge
compared to this eye okay today I'm
gonna be filming with these little guys
right here these are the cover shot
pallets from Smashbox that they did in
collaboration with Shay Mitchell and
they had the coolest packaging ever I
use the matte palette in the ablaze
palette and I do a palette / I like on
each eye no I'm sorry I've really been
enjoying these palettes and he's been
inspiring me to get out of my comfort
zone with makeup and do a little bit
more crazy looks especially the bold
palette I did a really cool cooly cooly
oh fiery look on my Instagram and I was
really impressed with myself yeah it
kind of inspired this video just because
there's so many different palettes and
um just like the different looks on my
eyes and how creative I could get with
them so I've had really a lot of fun
with these little guys
on another note if you didn't know I'm
giving away a MacBook Pro on my channel
and all you have to do is be subscribed
to enter that is it my friend so just
hit the subscribe button and you're
entered it ends on June we were 15 I
will announce the winner in a feather
video and put it in the scripture box
whenever it is time to announce a winner
other than that that's about all my
announcements we're going to go ahead
and jump in the video I hope you guys do
enjoy the video let's get started okay
guys first I'm gonna start off with my
brows I'm gonna go in with a thicker
brow pomade and I'm gonna fill them in
for the Instagram side because we all
know those Instagram eyebrows are no
joke so and then the other side I'm
going to do like with a pencil just
lightly penciled them in
this one's going to be bold AF
weezing
so for this I I'm just gonna take my NYX
micro brow pencil and I'm just gonna
lightly feather in some color to the
brow but not really put on a whole
eyebrow that one wasn't my color so now
I'm going to go in with my Revlon
Colorstay brow pencils
alright this brow is not quite as
natural you know but I don't have a lot
of eyebrows so we're just going to roll
with I'm gonna be using some cover shot
palettes from Smashbox this one is the
ablaze and then this one is the map that
I'm going to be using today
so these palettes are 29 bucks from
Smashbox and I come with beautiful long
weary eyeshadows and they give you more
base shades because you typically use
more base shades and a look and then you
dip into a little bit of your color
they're really nice have a great formula
they have paste watch amazingly and I've
been playing with them doing looks on
Instagram and they don't crease up in
your eyes so I'm going to use the ablaze
palette for my dramatic side which is
actually over here I'm going to go into
moccasin right here with a blending
brush this is an e30 eight brush from
Sigma and I'm on the wrong eye right
okay cool
I'm just going to apply this all over
the lid to line up our base swoosh woosh
washer I'm going to go into nirvana the
morphe 17 brush and I'm just going to
really smoke this out this is going to
be a really bold color and we're going
to take it pretty far out as anyone
would for a glam smoky Instagram look
I'm going to grab a little bit of throw
back with the same brush and just get
some other tip of my bouche go look at
that bland girl there was literally a
brush hair that was sitting on my upper
lip and a long mustache hair come on now
I believe this shade right here is
called a esta ma I'm going to take that
shade with the same brush and just kind
of deepen up that corner right there
so now I'm going to add a little bit of
a lighter shade on the lid these are so
nice watch once white get so much
pigmentation I think I want to use this
color my eyelid it's really pretty it's
like golden this shade is called relax
that I'm going to use next is to f70
brush from Sigma that I'm using it's
really great brush to apply this color
so pretty now I'm going to take a little
bit of my NYX liquid liner and I don't
think I'm gonna wing it Alex I want it
to remain just like really blown out and
smokey buddy I'm going to add some
definition and just line the eye girl
it's about to get lit these lashes are
so big I just put on whoo while that
dries cuz I know it looks a little crazy
what is drying I'm going to add a little
bit of my milk makeup facial primer and
I'm just going to add this all over my
face for my heavy duty side I'm going to
go in with a Milani this is the
two-in-one foundation and concealer and
it is raw
it is super duper like full coverage
then blend that out
and I'm going to go ahead and add some
foundation to this side I'm going to use
my Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
which is not nearly as much coverage so
great everyday foundation for like
everyday makeup and I won't add quite as
much like that's all I'm going to take
this y7 brush from morphe and just blend
that out you see a much more skin you
still see now I'm going to go in with
some la girl Pro concealer this is in
the shade natural and like this side I'm
just gonna come on you little bugger
there goes I'm going to just cover the
dark circle but girl this side we're
gonna cover in highlight our face honey
well that's a lot concealer I'm gonna
take a Beauty Blender just dab this am
and now I'm gonna do the same thing over
here I'm just gonna blend it out with my
Beauty Blender my booty blender but girl
we got a lot more blending to do
I take a little bit of my morphe banana
powder banana powder baby powder because
it's not like bananas tell me it
wouldn't be cool if I made a banana
powder that smelled like bananas that
would be cool just going to take this
little sponge and get on in there oh
that's good and then this I I'm just
going to add like a touch of facial
powder not really anything crazy just so
my eyeliner doesn't run in it so I'm
going to use my matte palette on this
eye and I'm just going to take this
space color just apply it all over next
I'm going to take the lightest brown
shade and it's just a great transition
shade this is a morphe 27 brush I'm just
going to blend that and now I'll take
the next brown shade over the same brush
I'm just going to add a little bit of
that to deepen it and this is about it
for this eye cuz anybody got time 15
colors in the moment now I'm just going
to take this pretty light base shade it
has like a nice little pink undertone to
it and apply it to the lid I'm gonna
curl these lashes people ask me all the
time why I don't curl my lashes and it's
because it really pretty much does
nothing for my lashes because they just
go straight back down even when I heat
the curler my lashes are just like
doomed right now they're going to go
straight back down now I'm going to
apply a little bit of mascara alright
for my drama side I'm just going to add
a little bit of cream contour
I'm just going to blend that on out and
then I take the butter bronzer with this
angled brush on this side and I'm just
going to warm up the skin a little bit
not really contour just add a little bit
I'm going to finish my under by by going
back in with this reddish color just
smoke that out and then I'm going to go
back in with this pretty pretty shade
and do the same thing and next I'm going
to take our deeper brown color I'm gonna
blend that close to the lash from the
lash real on that lash or lon
I'm gonna take my liner pencil I'm going
to take the dark black and put it my
waterline and then I'm going to take the
vanilla side and put it in this water
line and now I'm going to curl these
lashes for a second time the
never-ending battle girl stay I'm going
to take a little bit of my Sigma blush
this isn't quarter rosa and I like a
little bit of blush on both sides so I
mean I'm just gonna do about the same
emile you know oh god Lee we're gonna be
using conceited by artist Couture this
is a highlighter and I'm going to apply
a lot obviously to Magoo Marissa
and I use some of the tachi
do a luminous skin mist now as for the
lips so for my drama side over here I
think this is stolen my dose of colors
we're going to add some dimension over
line do the whole works next I'm gonna
take a little bit of sand and place it
in the center of like this side I'm
gonna take my Maybelline lipstick and
peach buff just one of my favorites by
the way and just stay in line my lawyer
