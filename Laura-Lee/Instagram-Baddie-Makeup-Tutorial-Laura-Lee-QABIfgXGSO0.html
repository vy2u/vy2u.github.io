video is going to be this look right
here it is Instagram makeup I do
Instagram makeup videos probably every
single day and a lot of you guys have
asked and request me to incorporate more
of those types of looks into my youtube
video so that is what I've done I've
listened to your comments and that's
what I'm gonna be doing today I will be
cream contouring today as requested from
you guys and I did use these NARS these
are the sculpting multiple duo's
obviously there are three of them and
have all three of them right here these
are a brand new product on our market
and I used two of them in the video and
they look like this they are dual din
one is for contour one is for highlight
so they are really quick and easy to
apply they're long lasting use them over
or underneath your foundation and it
gives you a natural looking glow to your
skin so I'm going to be showing you how
I use these so here's my Instagram
makeup look I hope you guys like it also
be sure to subscribe to my channel if
you haven't already and join the fun all
kinds of good stuff happening on this
channel and I don't want you to miss out
so be sure and subscribe today we're
gonna jump right in and get started hope
you enjoy the video starting out I'm
going to prime my skin using the
Smashbox photo-finish pore vanishing a
primer this primer is specifically for
pore so just apply in areas where my
skin needs a little more attention then
I'm going to go in with the Maybelline
matte and poreless foundation this one
is in shade 220 and I just stipple that
all over my face I am using a morphe
brush this is part of their gunmetal
collection and I'm always sure to drag
my foundation all the way down my face
this is the bare skin concealer and I'm
going to be using this to conceal my
under eyes just run it down the nose and
just to highlight particular areas as I
use my Instagram videos and our teeth
brush so I find it kind of important to
use this in my Instagram you know I
think of tutorial so I'm just going to
blend all that out just really gently I
believe this brush is the oval-8 brush
it might know it's oval six artiste
brush so I'm just going to blend all
that out and as instagramers including
myself do we always bake on Instagram
so I'm going to bake using a beauty
blender on my Laura Mercier loose
translucent setting powder it just helps
you make it last longer helps it not to
crease and gives it a flawless finish
the first sculpting do I'm going to use
is the hot sand Laguna I'm going to be
using the Laguna in guys Laguna's and my
favorite bronzer of all time so this was
easy for me and that's just what the hot
sand side looks like it's a pretty high
light shade so I'm going to take the
Laguna side and just carve out some
cheekbones I always came contour on my
Instagram you guys always say Laura do
it warned your videos yo but the NARS
sculpting sticks the colors are very
easy to use mistake proof but you can
also build them up and they haven't give
like a soft natural contour and a soft
natural highlight where it's not too
harsh on your skin and they're obviously
really easy to apply to the skin so I'm
just applying it to normal areas like my
forehead my temple areas down my nose
see if it won't structure nose to carve
out those cheekbones I'll even do the
jawline and I also did the eyelids
because we can contour out and give our
eyelids a little bit of depth now let's
focus on blending out the product taking
that same artiste brush I'm just going
to lightly blend it out as you can see
the product moves so easy and it is a
subtle contour so it's not going to be
harsh start going to be hard to move
around or deal with I know when cream
contouring sometimes blending is the
most difficult part so this product is
really easy to work with and the artiste
brush are definitely awesome for
blending out product you guys see me do
all the time my Instagram videos and get
so many questions on there artiste brush
and yes I do recommend them they are
quite pricey but they do a good job of
blending out the makeup they make the
job just easy you know I am so yes I'm
just gonna blend it all out on my nose
but chin my cheekbones and I just swipe
a few times you don't want to blend the
product til it's gone you just want to
blend it until it's much more softened
to answer some of your questions on
baking I do let the product sit there
for three to five minutes and let the
warmth of my skin cook it into my skin
and whatever's left I just dust away
with a fluffy brush and I'm doing just a
little bit of extra blending to my
eyelids and
two of my jaw line by the way good girl
yes now I'm gonna go in with the NARS
Laguna bronzer this is the powder form I
use this bronzer all the time actually
this is a brand new one hey and I'm
going to just set the contour I like to
set my cream contour I will tell you the
sticks to blend out to a powder so you
don't have to set your contour with
these I just do it to deepen it up a
little bit and just to brighten up my
nose then I'm going to add a little bit
of blush this is a sigma blush and I
don't know the name of it off the top of
my head but it will be in the
description box below next up for
highlight I'm going to be using play
flamenco the highlight side of the stick
and I do actually recommend applying it
from your fingers to your face not the
stick from your face but we are learning
and personally it did turn out really
pretty this way I just think it would be
easier process if you use your fingers
to your face and now I'm going to blend
it out with my fingers just to soften up
the look a little bit for eyeshadow I'm
going to take burnt orange from ABH and
take a t-38 blending brush and just
softly blend this out into my outer
corner and then push forward the rest
into the crease of my eye for our next
shade I'm going to take glazing this is
a very warm tone like brick reddish
color and I'm going to blend this right
on top of burnt orange just to build up
color and give us a gradient look then
I'm going to mix together fudge and
beauty mark but just the brown color
marks more of the purple color and I'm
really going to focus this on the outer
corner of the eye and it's going to help
open up our eyes and make them look a
little bit more dramatic and bigger then
I'm going to take this new shade I
believe it's new makeup geek this is
encore I did dampen it a little bit of
mac fix+ bright I didn't lick my brush
this time and I'm going to pack that on
to the lid next I'm going to take a
little bit of my NYC liquid liner and
wing it out you know that famous
Instagram wine
liner this is a really cheap alternative
to create that I've been using this
stuff forever and a day there it is then
I'm going to be taking this mask yerevan
11 lightly this is I believe it's called
encore lash I'm probably excessive lash
but make it forever it is Bob Bob
Diggity then I'm going to apply some
super dramatic lashes I believe these
are Minka notes from Lily lashes and I'm
going to smoke out Bert orange and
beauty mark on the lower lash line I'm
going to apply some black liner which is
darkside by a BH and apply some mascara
to those lower lashes to really build so
I really love the way that this look
came out and I ended up wearing it out
the next night - yes girl or boy you
know now I'm going to take this look a
lipstick from Stila and I'm going to
apply it all over my lips I try to stray
from a nude to change things up just a
little bit so we did a nudey pink
uh-huh-huh really this is a ma b pink
and i apply this all over then I take
this Velvet 59 liquid lipstick and I
apply it in the center it is quite the
contrast but I do take my finger and
blend it out it credit creates an ombre
effect
I always do this for Instagram pictures
why am i singing so much that's it for
this video thank you guys so much for
watching and I hope to catch you all on
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
