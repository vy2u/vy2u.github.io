like Oh putting it on the ground
guys welcome my channel I was there a
special guests here today
Oh angel Reno also known as Mac Daddy
and he is about to beat my face well I
already beat this face oh that's your
seed it's such a good job this is such a
good broth he turned me into himself I
feel like if I was here a girl I would
be like I would look like this on a
daily basis but I just really wanted her
to look really fresh and dewy I got to
use some new products that I'm really
excited for you guys to see I did a
collaboration with pure cosmetics so we
used my eye polish which is a kit that I
created a 5 we used one of the shades on
her eyes I have it on my eyes as well Oh
winged angel channel down below as well
be sure to subscribe to my channel I'm a
little YouTube virgin kind of you are
but you're like oh geez I'm trying to UM
you've been on them trying to company
early don't do it trying to come
floating I'm stealing her plaque when I
leave Oh we'll go ahead and jump into
the video yes keep watching you guys
okay so we're gonna start off with
prepping Laura's skin those guys spritz
a little fix+ oldest winner she's right
it's all in the fix plus you just gotta
you've gotta keep spraying it keep
spraying you spray this is gonna be
alright look it's gonna be very doing it
I'm just gonna use a Beauty Blender to
press the fix puss into the skin yeah
nice hairline by the way everybody as we
have I gotta get laser a little baby so
you have it literally proof thank you so
I think that were people missed the mark
with creating really beautiful makeup it
is like prepping the skin I think people
just kind of rush to like put on
foundation and put on makeup and they
don't take the time to like really work
the skin and perfect it and as you see
it takes half a bit of this plus bottle
has a bad name but I will get to
I use this little oil this is or BAE yes
so they started to actually create
makeup now isn't that hair it is 24
karat gold serum I lied it's not 24
karat and we're just an oppressor into
the skin I like to really kind of work
this underneath my eye area just to
really hydrate under the eye so that
everything is just a lot smoother yeah
ah it's not a good and I only press it
like right under here I don't do it on
the t-zone a little primer oh my god
you're so busy a little mist um poured
this is their illuminating primer which
I love
I meant to buy this whenever Sephora had
the Rouge so 20% off but I forgot it's
really bomb I feel like other products
that are supposed to do what this does
which kind of is that like opalescent
finish on the skin it aren't hydrating
enough they always still dry on my skin
so this is one of the first ones and I
was like ooh like I love the texture I
love what it's doing for me it's
hydrating I haven't really run into any
time for makeup that I hate yeah they're
killing it they're amazing something
that's super key that I always keep in
mind is I'm a very visual artist so you
have to look at the texture of the skin
if the skin looks dry add some more
moisture maybe a little Sturm so now
that I kind of see that her skin has a
nice shine to it she looks nice and
radiant nice and fresh this is kind of
like my indication that her skin is
ready for a little full coverage honey
I love it love it so we're gonna go in
with this cream foundation this is
literally like my go-to Holy Grail I use
this later I always use this on myself
always this is the RCM a cream
foundation and I'm using that same
Beauty Blender because it still has a
little bit of all of those products kind
of soaked into the sponge so it's just
going to press them back in but with the
our CMA and I'm literally just gonna
roll this on your skin and it literally
is gonna make
you look absolutely flawless I've ever
used this foundation never did you get
me interested it literally is like
perfect I mean look at that
oh my god that's beautiful get that wall
it's so affordable um you can I believe
you can get it online um but it is a
very like pro brand like it's not a lot
of people know about it um a lot of LA
base makeup artists do know about it
like a lot of industry pros know about
it but great thing about it is that it's
so highly pigmented which is how you can
get such nice coverage and it is full
coverage um but it has that beautiful
skin like texture so your skin just
looks like your skin your skin looks
like perfect butter there are pretty
your skin works well it looks so pretty
and the cool thing about this I feel
like it's really difficult to pull off a
really do we look with a lot of makeup
but with like this foundation you can
literally do like oh my god all creams
cream highlight cream bronzer cream
blush so we're gonna lay down all of the
highlight first I always like to do kind
of highlight contour skin first and then
we'll do like the eyes and I always like
to create more brightness like in the
center of the face like this one though
me too is that kind of creative mm-hmm
I'm most like a big eye stamp on it does
Kate
if you're ever like oh I don't have a
tampon like well I have my shape tape
and they're prepping prime highlighters
this one right here I especially love to
kind of just add it right in the
crevices of the eyes just like really
give you like a nice little just kind of
like mmm pop a brightness right in there
you didn't have to buy just it always
with the product for them done fifty
dollars you meet 500 arting to like you
buddy and bring back come out with me
identical like with a beard I would die
I should do Mac Daddy transforms Lauren
to mack daddy is pure cameo contour stay
visible is the bottom that little chisel
cheekbone alright guys so we got deep
into work and kind of quit talking here
but anyways right now angel is using the
dampened Beauty blender just to blend
out that cameo contour that he applied a
took a lot of time adding a little bit
more product blending it out and now
he's taking the RM see a setting powder
and he's carving out underneath the
contour to really clean it up and make
it a nice sharp contour and he's going
to do the exact same thing and big my
under-eye making sure it's not going to
crease and then at last last and then it
lasts long it looks flawless after is
set for a while he'll sleep it away now
he's going to work on the brows first he
went in with the Mac brow Jo in the
shade Burnett and he started to carve
out some eyebrows and then he went in
with the benefit first cisely brow
pencil and lastly angels gonna carve out
the brows using the mac studio finish
concealer so I actually like to use a
studio finish concealer as a base
so we're gonna use this coloured raine
pretty dirty Queen of Hearts
palette what about tanning right to
blend this color this is cold air I'm
working this all in the crease just to
kind of give it a little dimension
little contour how long does this jar of
setting powder last you oh gosh a week a
week surrounding this chocolate color
called Duchess just to kind of deepen up
the crease next angel blended in the
Duchess color a little bit more on my
lid and he took his eye polish that he
created with pure cosmetics which is now
for sale and applied it to my lid I will
have the shade and the links to all the
products down below and then to blended
out he just the edges of it and blended
it with a soft blending brush in a
patting motion and just making sure
there were no harsh lines and everything
was soft and creaseless on my lid just
dust off all that fallout just to kind
of really clean up and define using a
little chewy liner because of the eye
shape that I want this to take look up
we're just gonna kind of apply this
chocolaty liner just on the outer
corners of the eye we're gonna be using
Bella lashes by icon San Angel is
customizing them to my eye shape because

look trim trim Jo now
