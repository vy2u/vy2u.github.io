channel today's video is me testing out
these butter LONDON glazing eye gloss
now they kind of like an eye jelly and
I'll show you when we get into the video
why I say that very strange I product I
never really used anything like it and
honestly I've never seen anything like
it
I have it on my eyes right now so I'm
kind of giving you a sneak peek on into
the video but I'm really excited to
review for you guys it was sent to me in
PR and I open it up how's like oh this
could be a cute video idea
I also test out the glaze and luster 2
liner my butter LONDON they're like go
together or whatever so I figure why not
two stood out as well I'm wearing one of
them right now oh Justin because I just
ate elf hold up oh do you know that lol
was my first fast food place that I ate
out whenever I moved to California and
I'm still eating is so good I get a
couple chicken so far with no bees no
sour cream add the creamy cilantro
dressing moving on back into the video
anyways these are my butter LONDON I'm
never I don't think I've ever done like
a person pressures on butter lemon so
here we are and I guess we'll jump right
into the video I don't think I have
anymore and now Smith's I mean I told
you about the eye shadow told you eh
okay your local girl we couldn't let's
roll with it
don't forget subscribe freely all right
jumping right into the video I got this
little pressed sheet on it it was sent
to me in PR and I got the liners and the
blazing eye gloss if you flip it over it
shows you ways you can combine the eye
gloss win eyeliner super strange and you
know it looks really cool it does it
gives you the wet effect but with a dry
finish I will say one of my main issues
with the little boogers is that whenever
not these I'm sorry
my main issue with wet eye visit is like
glue on your eyelid because you can
totally put lip gloss on your eyelid at
the website but it's just super annoying
to wear but easy easily wearable
my opinion so these are 24 bucks and
they have seven shades at three of the
seven shades so let me go ahead and show
you the shades first we have shoot what
it says mermaid mermaid is the shade
I'll probably you today the most excited
about then we have icing they come with
a little top too so they don't dry out
and then we have a natural air color
called moonshine I went ahead and swatch
icing and moonshine for you guys because
I'm not going to be applying these to my
lid I'm going to use mermaid but woah
they look pretty high child hey looks so
creamy so I want you guys to visually
see how it looks like a little pot of
jelly oh I watch it do you see it do you
see how that way Rumble like jelly like
blue ah and then look you can see it
like it'll pour out of here
like as a whole but it stays in one
piece who is not really liquidy it's
like this jelly like formula flip
Lestrange super strange look at that as
one touch it was touch it alright this
video is getting a little weird huh you
know you wanted me to touch it though
look at that
do you see that do you see that it
strange before we get started and we're
going to pop a little bit of a
transition crease in just like a little
brownish color simple enough and then
I'm going to take the mermaid shade I
want to read and see online it says that
their life lightweight crease resistant
long wearing a buildable sheer - intense
metallic conditioning to the eye helps
prevent dry eyelid on line cretinous a
unique jell jelly agent gives a
pudding-like texture suspension gives
the product a wet look on the lids but
it feels dry see it says to apply with
the finger apply to the inner corner and
work your way outward and you can add
another layer if you need to so I'm glad
I read that but I wasn't apply it with
my finger anyway because you look like a
product li you should apply with your
finger I got some more finger let's see
what happens mmm
all right so my gosh like dead-ass look
at that let's just see this could be
everything like such a small tiny amount
of product seems to be going a really
long way would you look at that I'm
going to build up just a little bit more
like it said I think I need a weight to
it dry
Wow so I think I definitely have like
the wet I look down
that is so cool let's go ahead and do
the other eye
showers girl this is some i'ma still man
on the eyeshadow right here you know so
I'm just going to wipe my hand with this
little makeup wipe and clean up where my
finger tap down oh man check out my
concealer uh they're really pretty it
looks I mean I don't know I say I think
it looks great I feel like I definitely
have like look from a distance like my
eyelids I don't a little more metallic
or wet I don't know this is it's more
wet did they look I think maybe more if
they do call it kind of wet but I think
they mostly look a bit metallic super
intense pigment with these really easy
use applied so simple and a little shook
right now as you can see my eyes like
crease a little bit up so let's just see
as it dries like how it greases up in my
eyes with a balls-up it's awful I also
have the glazed in luster liners I have
the three shades I have it um I would
call it shake me up all those hello like
trying to tell me to shake it
I've ultraviolent flare and magenta k--
and i'm gonna try this blue or shirt
everyone I see yeah I might try this
blue shade whoever jealous we shall look
at that
you definitely have glitter in it and
it's super pigmented I normally don't
like felt tip line is because I can't
get a really pretty winged liner look
out of it but I'm going to try out this
liner and see how it where that was
wet eyeshadow
the liner is not that easy to apply but
I'm telling you this because it is the
spilt tip applicator and they're just
not a favorite comment down below your
favorite type of liner applicator I
prefer the little skinny brush oh man I
feel like the liner is picking up a
little bit of the little bit of the eye
polish like do you see the chunks right
there like the liner is trying to pick
it up a little bit so that's kind of
annoying do you see like that chunk
that's a chunk of eyeshadow and I am
creasing a little bit right in here
right in there hmm
I've been too crazy but I am creasing up
just delete it and also if you can see
the glitter is like flaking right
through the liner am I going to layer it
up a little bit I mean the liner is
super bold and I really like that about
it it's a little difficult to apply with
the eyeshadow and I see that I chose
trying to crease just a tiny tiny bit I
don't think it's anything extreme let's
see the line that yeah the eyeshadow is
dry which is nice I do kind of like this
eyeshadow would be a moment that if you
put up like some matte black liner on
top of it it was crust down onto your
liner and you'd have those little flakes
all of your eyeliner I could just see
that happening is it's kind of already
happening with this maybe we just get
started I'm like that means home the
whole baby what you feel with
do you see the like Oh kind of get on my
nerves it's like chunking up right there
get awesome hmm okay so I actually think
that these will cool together it's just
the fact of getting them together it's a
little difficult I think that the
products have a hard time meshing
together because the felt tip liner as a
little horn it's like scraping up pieces
of the eyeshadow and because I chose so
glittery very small like so it does like
trickle down onto the liner which leaves
it looking a little bit messy I don't
hate it I don't hate the liner and I
think like once I've got it all figured
out and done a couple layers of liner I
like it I would be annoyed if I came
home at the end of the night and like
the eyeshadow had trickled down onto her
groom my marriage al fondo I look like
my almost got dandruff but I think the
products supercool
let's see much the eyeliner is I went
ahead and swatch the rest of the liner
for you they are a $19 each and there's
a total of four shades and I have three
of the four shades here so yeah let me
know down in the comments your thoughts
do you think is that this is worth $24
and easing the liner is worth $19 would
you wear this do you find it wearable
like let me know your thoughts on the
comment section down below you know I've
already kind of all my thoughts on it
girl you got lipstick on y'all please oh
alright all my thoughts upon it I think
it's a cool product I would wear it out
maybe with no eyeliner and just some big
false lashes so we avoid the crusty
fallout maybe wear the liner with
something else because the liner is cool
and super pigmented I do have to be
patient with except felt-tip we are
that's it for this video guys thank you
so much for being here and watching and
be sure and subscribe before you mean
and if you enjoyed my jelly eyeshadow
