my channel you're on the Whirley channel
where we do lots of tough hop love
singing and lots of reviews that should
be my intro that should be my new intro
because that could not be more of the
truth today's video is going to be on my
favorites and then mrs. hits and misses
of the month it's kind of fun doing this
because it's like a little bit of a
recap of products that I played with on
my channel over the month and one so it
didn't work out ones with that did work
out so so we did this video I have a
data favorites in a really long time and
I need to do a favorites and talk about
the products and I'm loving and products
that I don't love we're going to go
ahead and jump right in the video but
first we have to sing a little jingle
together and we'll go ahead and jump
right in and get started that's all
would be a lot better if I knew how to
sing okay let's jump right in with
products I love I feel like I should go
back and forth a little bit that way the
video stays entertaining for you guys so
first we'll talk about products I love
that love and then we move on to
products I just like didn't work out at
all first part I've been absolutely
adoring is this NYX this is the ultimate
multi finish eyeshadow palette and oh my
gosh these are so pigmented and you get
so many colors in this palette and I
really love this setup it's a matte
shimmer and a glitter so you can get a
really big bang for your buck in the
color scheme is so pretty it's actually
what I have on my eyes right now I feel
like these swatch just as good as
high-end eyeshadows these are
magnificent they have a whole bunch of
them colorful ones - I really like this
one this one is warm rust it's my
favorite I also like this one it's
called a sugar high it's really cute too
but warm rust is definitely takes the
cake for me I'm such a sucker for warm
home products and I know people always
like stop using warm tones but they're
my favorite I'm not going to feel bad
about using them because I love them I
love them so I kinda like this peachy
look with it today and I just think it's
great if you see it out it's definitely
worth the money get it if you're a warm
tone love and girls but they also have
different shades as well I just think
they're they're awesome awesome palette
actually have a crapload of products to
talk about so let's just like
keep going let me talk about one more
products that I've been loving and is I
have it I've used it like four times so
I'll admit I haven't used it for like
months and months a month but I have
used it four times and I just think my
skin looks so beautiful under my
foundation with it on this is the photo
finish primer plus moisturizer and one
it has Holl erotic acid in it so this is
a new product from Smashbox it's a
really moisturizing primer my skin's a
little bit of combination my forehead
and like this area gets so wet and
greasy and then the rest of my face
stays dry so I'm like girl what are we
doing over here but anyways this product
just works well I find it it's thin
enough so it doesn't make your face too
Olli but then it has enough moisture in
it so it helps out with the dry areas
and I think my skin just looks so pretty
under it so I'm raving about this
product it's awesome and I recommend it
to you guys
product that did not work out for me was
this Stila stay all day foundation plus
concealer I recently tried this out in
one of my videos and it was not a fit a
lot of people said on camera they
thought it looked good on my skin but
guys I was trying to explain in the
video the way it felt it felt so heavy
and greasy and it looked heavy and
greasy but you didn't have that much
coverage so my girl if it's gonna be
heavy it would be covering something up
this really wasn't covering much but yet
it looked like I had a ton of makeup on
and that I was just not there for now
this is supposed to be a spot consider I
guess instead of a under-eye concealer I
put under my under eyes I hated it under
my under eyes it doesn't say it's a spot
concealer so I think that's just people
saying that it is like it doesn't say
that it just says it's a concealer so
you can put that under your eyes is just
really thick and cakey and I didn't like
the concealer either so this whole
product I love Stila this product was a
bust for me
so another part that I've just been here
for speaking of under eyes hello this is
the winged brightening concealer now I
am normally I'm kind of like skeptical
about brighteners and like it's too much
makeup it's another add-on you don't
need it in your life but then I was
watching Holly Boone I really liked her
channel a lot she does really awesome
makeup tutorials and she was using the
under eye brightener before concealer I
believe I might be wrong but I believe
that's where I saw it I was like you
know what benefit just came out with a
new one
let me take a little
at it so I went ahead and I would tap
with my finger it's so cute like a
personal ratio oh my god I'm soaked in
anyway sure I would dab a little bit of
this with my finger I just need my
finger and I just touch just that
darkness right there just and that's it
and then I'll put my concealer on top of
it and I think it really helps to cancel
out the darkness and this product is it
too heavy where you're creasing and
caking on the under eye so this by me
being against like the whole color
correcting and like adding all this
extra makeup on I actually really love
this I've been using it a lot lately and
I think it truly helps cancel out that
darkness by the way I'm using shade
number two all right another products
that didn't work out for me this is by
Urban Decay and then this is their
channel isn't press beauty powder so
this is the pressed powder but it has a
lot of luminosity in it and I kind of
press it on my skin and I press it on my
under-eye just press it on places that I
like to the powder my skin looks so
luminize and my pores look like they
were times 10 and I kind of looked a
little bit breezy just putting like this
it has pure glitter in it you can see
this fine grain sparkles in it and then
it have like a sheen to it so there's
like rubbing a highlighter all over your
face it's not really going to do you
favors in areas that you have the
wrinkles or pores like it wasn't helping
me out at all it's just making things
worse so this product definitely did not
work out for me I'm not going to
recommend it to you guys I powder the
did work out for me and you guys have
seen me talk about this so much on my
channel because I've been enjoying it
tons this is a Born This Way ysidro
setting powder by Too Faced
Noble it's not on it because I keep it
open on my desk right here with my
little sponge in it so I can pack I
really like to bake with this powder it
reminds me a lot of the cover that
setting powder and it does not flash
back so it has like not that silky
translucent still to it but more like an
actual powdery powder filled that makes
any sense to it and it makes the skin
look flawless I gotta say two-face is
born this way the whole line it's pretty
darn good makeup so I was expecting a
lot out of this and I got a lot out of
this I love this powder so I've been
using this like non-stop another product
I've been loving girl
is my girlfriend a coal pencil yes
palette she collab with a violet boss a
huge congrats to you Nicole I'm so
excited for you and the palette I loved
the design on it very much her logo her
brand I thought it was so pretty and
then she has all these beautiful super
pigmented colors have been playing with
it a lot I remember I did a look at her
event I wore this on my eyelid and it's
very pretty this is like a white with a
blue pair pearlescent in it and then you
get a lot of pretty warm tones in here
lots of pretty neutral shimmers for the
lid and then a pop of blue and a pop of
green actually wore green the other day
too in a video and a might get ready
with me but this palette is awesome guys
go get it support your girl Nicole I'll
have it linked down below and again I'm
so happy for you Congrats girl Congrats
alright a product that did not work out
for me and now this is just like a
personal preference didn't work out for
me just to see cover effects highlighter
and sunlight these feel more like a
facial powder than a highlighter they're
just really subtly and powdery now if
you like a super super super natural
highlight you'll probably like this
actually it just is something that I'll
never use they're actually quite soft
but they just come off more as like a
face powder than a Luminizer so it's too
subtle for me I personally like my
highlighters like well I'm here and this
does not work out for me so I got a pass
on it but a highlighter they did work
out for me I really have been loving me
so much and I'm not really one to use a
liquid highlighter every single day but
I've kind of been using these every
single day and the reason why they show
so well and pictures and I take
Instagram pictures all the time and I
really won't mind I like to be poppin
and these work so well they do remind me
a lot of the cover of eggs customs drops
they're just unreal with pigmentation
now the thing is I think they're the
same price I like 45 bucks for the
custom cover for as the custom cover job
so these are the same price I know some
youtubers have discount codes with this
so I recommend using a discount code
with it it gets your money off I don't
have a discount code with it so find a
discount code if you get these to get
some money off but
a lot it's not like I just I live for
these I just bathe in them all the time
you can even make like a drop or two in
your foundation if you want like a
really luminosity glowy finish I don't
personally do that but you can do that I
love this stuff the last item that
didn't work out for me was by CIPA just
to see magic POW potion I tried this out
in the video and it's supposed to
neutralize your lip so your color shows
up more your lip color it's also
supposed to plump your palp and sadly
enough it just put like this white cake
over my lips if you saw my testing out
weird products video you saw that go
down and it didn't pump the lips at all
so this was gimmicky as I would say and
I was just not here for this by any
means and I won't use it again I don't
think it's that affordable either it's a
good you know product in theory but
overall I just wasn't here for it
another product that I have been loving
so that was the last of products I
didn't like so the rest of the bit
products of the video will be products
that I'm just like over the moon for as
did your show pomp and show mascara I
adore this stuff and your life Laurie
you wear false lashes all the time how
do you know you love a mascara so with a
mascara it has to grab lashes like I
hate watery mascaras it just like kind
of silky off the lashes I like for to
clump up and build out volume so that
one's this one does that so well and it
also has to lift the lashes a little bit
because my lashes grow straight down
whenever I put on false lashes if I turn
sideways you can see them like popping
out so with a mascara I really like it
to like curl and lift the lashes I can
cake them up a little bit this will
crawl your lashes it just has like a
sticky texture to it where it makes your
lashes like stick up I love it I love it
I love it now my next product I've been
enjoying sometimes I have a little bit
of a hard time finding a bronzer from
the drugstore that is not it's not that
warm tone I like my bronzers to be a
little bit more of a deeper almost a
cool tone and I found with it I've
really been liking this is the trublend
bronzer number 200 from covergirl it's a
baked bronzer I have like these white
pieces in it that doesn't really show up
on your skin it has a touch of shimmer
in it but again that's not really
showing up on your skin uses mostly out
of this product get this beautiful
bronze glow out of it and it's an
affordable product I'm like finally I
got a brother I'm up in the job store
it looks really golden on camera but
that's me doing a hard swatch across it
like whenever the brush hits it it picks
it up not so aggressively and it doesn't
really look that gold on the skin it
looks way more bronze but this is just
fabulous and last but certainly not
least I've been dying over the Milani
make it last setting spray this stuff is
so good and for whatever reason it
smells like perfume it's also good I
just wish you got more of it as a bottle
it's so tiny but I do love the product I
think it's great I don't think it make
sure makeup lasts for 16 hours but I
think it makes your makeup lasts for a
really long time and it sets it and
gives your makeup maybe even like a
little bit of a beautiful not really a
glow which is more of a more natural
look I feel like it helps with the
powder powder enos but I guess any
setting spray does that pretty much but
this really does make it lie laughs and
I adore this product it's great
drugstore setting spray and lastly I
have to talk to you guys about my bronze
goddess most of their like 90% of bronze
goddess collection I'm obsessed with
from Estee Lauder they really hit the
nail on the head with this collection so
I used the collection all the time the
lipstick to highlight I just tried out
in a video it was awesome this I adore
so what I do is I literally just take
like one squirt like on my knee and you
know I'll rub it all over my legs and
body and everywhere and if this thing
was beautiful hydrating glow on your
body so if I'm going to be out in the
Sun and we're out and about I just put a
little bit on and I'll roll with it and
in pictures your skin you will look like
greasy fried chicken and that's just
what I look like okay but this is
marvelous and it smells good too then
smell chicken good what it smells good
that is all the products a dimension you
guys jeez Louise we went through a lot
of products but I haven't done a
favorites video in a minute I feel like
I don't know I do test out a lot of
products on my channel but sometimes I
feel like if I do the favourites every
single month that I won't have enough
new product so I like to space it out
let me know in the comments if you guys
you know want me to keep these let me
know in the comments if you guys want me
to keep doing
favorites videos or not I don't know
just let me know what y'all want me to
do and I think that's all I have for you
