get any wrong arm I didn't get a new
tattoo just saving that anyways um
today's video is obviously gonna be my
January favourites and I'm gonna talk to
you guys about all the stuff that I have
been obsessed with for the month of
January
including this shirt right here I wore
yesterday as well as today well only
working a little bit yesterday so I'm
still gonna wear it today just for a
little bit and now I'm change anyway
this is a shirt from brandy melville am
I love it also if you haven't already
subscribed to my channel you can click
right here and subscribe I post like
three videos a week so there's a lot
going on and you definitely want to join
the u2 theme jam let's jump right in and
get started
so first we always start off favorite
videos with our favorite song and TV
show of the month we'll start my
favorite TV show and obviously that has
Evan like snapping and tweeting about it
so much this why I say obviously but the
following on Netflix where are we at
tower season what season 3 is getting so
juicy it's crazy it's like a detective
and a murder thing so if you're into
that kind of stuff watch the following
Kevin Bacon is the main star we call him
the Baconator okay my favorite song for
the month by Diplo and sleepy tom be
right there really good Jam check it out
touching a song it's a jam sesh so it's
one of those you're gonna want to write
in your car long roll up the windows
maybe and turn it all the way up and
sing your heart out - such a good song
anyways we're gonna move on to actual
products because I have a lot to share
with you there's so much new stuff
coming out right and left and we're
gonna jump ready to get started so let's
do this
palette palette palette is the first
thing I want to talk to you do I got
makeup alright anyways this is the Quinn
Stefani and urban decay now this is not
the eyeshadow palette it's actually the
blush and the bronzer palette it is a
gorgeous palette it comes with three are
really for blush shades a nice
mattifying pretty much matte bronzer
shade and then a nice angel it's called
a Cheol this is a highlight shade all
the shades are extremely pigmented
they're buttery they're creamy they're
not chalky whatsoever and
I think all the shades in this palette
are super wearable for me mostly I've
been mixing the blush shades together
wearing the bronzer the highlighter
they're all amazing I definitely
recommend this palette almost more than
the eyeshadow palette like if you need a
new facial products bronzer blush
highlight this is your girl moving right
along I actually have another face
palette I want to share with you guys
and this is a newer one for me but for
the price and what it is I think it is
just something well worth it so this is
the 90 by morphe brushes you can get
this at morphe brushes calm I do have a
discount code to save money it's Laura
Lee it's just my name super easy to
remember I'll put it like over here but
anyway this is actually like a contour
palette and it's a powder one so it's
super user friendly I love the shades in
it because they're very cool tone and
they're very matte therefore is just so
easy to use and it makes your skin look
flawless and then you have this shade in
the middle right here which is somewhat
of a shimmer and it's kind of like a
nice highlighter shade and then you have
these shades which are amazing to set
your concealer so it's just like an
all-in-one great palette if you want a
new affordable contouring palette I
highly recommend this one to you and
it's not chalky dusty powdery it's not
like gonna go whenever you use it it's
like very creamy colors for the price
especially moving right along we're
gonna just keep talking about face
products because I'm on a roll and we're
just gonna keep that one the next base
product I want to talk about it's just I
tried and true and I just think I need
to talk about it more because I've been
wearing this a lot off-camera which is
random for me to say but it's just
something I have been grabbing towards a
lot this month and this is the NYX HD
they're creamy or they're a mix HD
concealer I am in shade cwo for beige
this is the perfect shade for me I
absolutely love this it's the greatest
coverage it blends out so well it's just
an awesome concealer for the price my
only complaint is that it seems like it
runs out so quick like I don't know what
the deal is with that but I just feel
like it doesn't last me five minutes but
it's an awesome product and a forum AB
to like foundation products you guys are
like what she doin down there
I'm shaking this one up this is actually
Becca cosmetics new foundation and this
is the Becca aqua luminous perfecting
pound this one definitely gives you that
nice dewy skin finish and looking like a
glowing mermaid that just popped out of
the water I adore this foundation I'm
gonna go ahead let you know if you have
very oily skin I don't think that you're
gonna like this foundation my skin looks
wet for a long time whenever I apply it
and then once it finally settles down it
just gives my skin that nice really
healthy beautiful limited I just call my
skin beautiful I need a stop right now
gives it just that nice glowy look where
it's just blue - and not it's not flat
or matte whatsoever and I love that
about it I have somewhat dry skin and
it's been working out for me very well
you're supposed to shake it before you
use it and then this shimmed egg see how
you pop that up and then it just comes
in a dropper I normally just do like a
full drop I probably use too much
product I'm really bad about that but
I'm okay with it and the shade that I am
in is a beige I'm a beige kind of girl
the next faced products I want to talk
about is actually pretty much the
opposite of the Becca foundation it is
the new skin tip from NARS so this isn't
actually a foundation actually I want to
show you here is the original skin tip
by NARS this is the pure radiant skin
tint and this is the Velvet Matte skin
tint don't confuse the two because
they're two different worlds this one's
a very thin BB cream filling situation
I'm not that obsessed this I can't put
down I adore this and I can wear this
every day just about as my foundation I
will let you guys know I was in Cabo
this month and this is the only pretty
much the only sun protection I had on my
face in the Sun which is very intense
there I didn't get a look at sunshine I
mean nothing on my face and that is my
goal because you guys have no idea how
much Sun ages you and how dangerous with
skin cancer so my goal is to not have
the Sun touch my face and not only that
it looked like I had foundation on but
really it was just a lightweight skin
tint is
amazing coverage and it's very matte so
if you have oily skin this will be your
new best friend we're just gonna keep
going with face products for you guys
well like this goes crazy when will she
stop okay moving on so actually I got to
try out the artist couture highlights
and actually they're called diamond glow
powder yeah they're diamond glow powder
I am in love and I have like discovered
out of all of them my very favorite one
that I'm wearing right now today and it
is yeah I'll put it right here so you
get what I'm saying yeah that's the name
of it this one is just a really pretty
nice era definite highlight I mean it's
on the tip of my nose I'm obsessed with
these and a very little bit goes a long
way they're super gorgeous I'll
definitely be using them in tutorial so
you guys can see them in action but
there are so many to choose from and
there's also pinky ones which I think
will look gorgeous sitting right on top
of a blush as the bush topper because
you know we all want to be glowing a
little bit nowadays I've talked to you
guys about these liquid lipsticks
because they are so good I love them so
much so still a liquid lipsticks seem to
sell out so fast I know they're at Ulta
and I am wearing one right now I adore
the quality of them because they're not
they're just not drawing on me they just
absolutely do not feel look so gross but
they don't pill crusty whatsoever and I
have very dry lips mostly because I
don't drink enough water here they're
new shades I will list all the shades
down below and I oh-seok immediately
just snapchatted the swatches which are
on my hand right now I'm so in love with
all of the shades I have one more lip
gloss I want to mention to you guys in
it's by NARS this is instant crash it's
just a really pretty mocha and nude
color and what you get on your lips is
very sheer but alright whenever I wear
nude lips I normally like my lips flat
but whenever you'd wash your lips it
does enhance them and make them look a
little bit more full so I have been
popping this gloss I'll get in the
center and they didn't hit myself in the
mouth has just been doing the Viva boom
for my lips
couple skincare things I'm gonna talk to
you guys about the first one is Murad
this is their a hydrodynamic Ultima also
ultra moisturizer I love this
moisturizer because I feel like it does
wonders for my skin as far as giving it
just enough moisture but not too much
because there's a fine line and if you
cross it you run into all kinds of
problems like clogged pores breakout
greasy skin anyways you can just run
into all types of problems if you go too
hard on moisturizer you just have to
give your skin like the perfect amount
of moya's me like if I have to give my
skin the exact perfect amount of
moisture or else it just goes haywire on
me the next skincare I know that I have
been using is these - the pill cleansing
wipes I think these are at any drugstore
pretty much but they're very effective
in not burning out your eyeballs
whenever you're trying to remove your
makeup they're just they're not even a
makeup remover they're just like face
wipe but they do pretty good at taking
off makeup and you guys make a remover
Sarah like underneath your eyes and crap
just burnin afterwards you won't have
that with these and I don't know if it's
because they don't have makeup remover
and all but the for sensitive skin they
are awesome
my friend gave me a sample pack and it's
empty one more favorite and is an eye
product
this is serene by GA cosmetics and I did
use this in a tutorial it's just one of
my favorite products especially if
you're gonna be by the pool or any kind
of beachy situation cream is the way to
go because a cream product is gonna last
longer on your sweaty face than a powder
product it's a cream eyeshadow crayon by
G way this one isn't serene and it's my
absolute favorite color you can
literally look at that that crazy look
how this is like glowing your eyelid
will look this pretty so what I'll do is
how color this on my lid and just like
do this with my finger kind of smudge it
out kind of like that and then my eyelid
will look like that in the color doesn't
budge it doesn't crease because it's a
cream and I typically won't put anything
else in my island so that's it for my
favorites for this month everything that
I mentioned you already know would be
listed in the description box so be sure
to check that up I love you guys so much
thank you so much for being here and I
hope to see you yeah I'm talking to you
