today's video is my favorites video yes
my normal background is back and I know
a lot of you guys are happy to see it I
wasn't gonna keep the backdrops forever
my talky tug videos we're gonna have the
normal background so don't you worry the
normal what no what are you eating new
it's like having an infant anyway oh she
spit out lots of favorites to share with
you and lots of new items that I've been
obsessing over so we're just gonna jump
right in this video and loaded
is she sassing me
we always start off my favorites video
on this channel with my favorite song of
the month okay here my favorite song of
the month is stitches by Shawn I want to
say Mendes but I can't remember but the
name of the song is stitches and it's so
cute and it's so catchy and a sight oh
it's a good song and I really think you
guys would like it so check it out and
then my favorite TV show is not on
Netflix it's actually like just on TV I
know so lame right my favorite TV show
is I think it's called shark tank and
it's where inventors bring their
invention to a bunch of investors and
they decide if they want to invent it
just like this show because you can
learn so much on creating your own
business you know the in and outs of
money the investments all that jazz and
it's cool to see people's inventions and
when they come up with and what they put
their hearts and souls into them begging
for an investor to pick them up so I
just like the show I find it really
interesting I don't think it'll be for
everyone but uh don't leave now we'll
jump into the actual stuff first item I
want to share with you guys is brush-on
block basically this is a mineralized
Sun screen and it comes in a brush which
is quite different in a pretty cool
invention I love it a lot and you guys
know I talk a lot about sunscreen
skincare on my channel because I used to
work for dermatologists and I saw the
bad side from the sunshine he is not
your best friend I love using this for
whenever I get my nails done the UV
lights that you have to put your nails
in to get the gel nails is horrible for
your skin it's like sticking your hand
in
I bet this is so portable that I can
just throw it in my purse and then I
just dust the I mean I don't know can
you see that I can dust the mineral
sunscreen on my hands you're like is I
really covering it it's water-resistant
is sweat-proof in its SPF 30 and I
always like to go SPF 30 or higher so
it's protecting my hands good for your
mom your dad your brother your sister
your cat your dog don't put on your
candle another thing I really like it
for is because whenever I put just pure
sunscreen on my face and I sweat I feel
like my pores exorbitant I always get
one big fat nodules it because it's like
clogging my pores I love this mineral
sunscreen for my face because it's a
mineral sunscreen not like a grease and
it's gonna protect my skin but not clog
my pores like that's my favorite thing
about it and you can get a free refill
with the link below like with your
purchase it's just like unsnap screws aw
thanks partner I want to mention to you
guys is the new Anasazi Beverly Hills
shadow contour palette oh my goodness I
love this palette so much and a lot of
you guys were asking me should I get
this smokey Naked palette from Urban
Decay they just came out with it with a
shadow Couture palette because they came
out at about the same time and I know a
lot of you guys were on the fence about
it I highly recommend this one over the
naked smoky palette plus is $30 um
that's like 25 bucks cheaper than that
naked smoky palette I see sitting over
there oh I see you like this palette
because it has so many neutral colors in
it but yet so many wearable colors in it
like all of these are neutral and then
you have a blue a purple and maybe a
lightish pink which is still neutral
it's just such an awesome palette and
another thing I like a lot about it I
mean the colors they're heavenly creamy
and super pigmented and you can blend
them out for days but besides all that I
just like that I can create a complete
and total look with this palette like
multiple looks with this palette without
having to reach out and go get another
eyeshadow like all I need is this
palette it is life I'm obsessed I want
to talk about a new concealer that I
have just been a love
concealer is the superstay better skin
concealer by Maybelline it is all free
and that was just a huge plus so if you
ever want to highlight your whole face
such as the under eye area forehead down
the nose chin usual areas you don't have
to worry about it breaking out your skin
because it is all free the thing I like
about it most it has a very good
coverage and it's long-lasting it's very
long lasting it doesn't fade you have to
set it with a powder I never recommend
putting a concealer on your face and not
setting it with a powder but I mean set
it with a powder but it's awesome it's a
really good concealer if you're
wondering my shade which is just perfect
because I like to go a shade lighter it
is light medium shade 30 this product I
it's like been a tried-and-true for me
forever I just went back to them these
are the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes
a lot of makeup wipes like sting on my
eyes or burn the tinder skin that or the
I should say delicate skin that is
underneath the eye area and I'm just
like huh while using them so I went back
to these these just don't do that for me
like they just take off the makeup
without all the stinky stinky burn burn
so yes I went back to them and I loved
them mm-hmm
can I talk to you guys about a little
gadget that I have just came to fall in
love with this is a color switch will
will I add it will okay it's the color
switch by their omona I actually met her
and she is she's literally just a little
dream and this just simplifies the
process of life and makeup if you're a
makeup artist you don't have this stop
what you're doing and get it all you
have to do it stays dry it's just like
this little messy sponge in here there's
like eye shadow blowing out of it I do
is you just spin you a little brush
around it dry you don't have to put
product on it if you don't want to like
such as brush cleaner and stuff you can
just put it on their dry run your brush
around it and your brush will be clean
of that color if your makeup artist you
can see how like this would ease your
day and make your life so much better if
you're not like me I no longer freelance
but whenever I'm doing a makeup look and
I want to keep using the same brush I
can just spin it two seconds later the
brush clean ready to go in the next
color it's just a dream and it's so
lightweight and easy to trap with yes
an iPad that I don't even know I also
just want to mention this little case I
have been dying over I've been traveling
out of it for I think five days straight
like I just took the stuff that I had in
it out and put my favorites in it oh
this is spiky face it was sent to me
it's a PR listing thing for beauty
bloggers and it had all the foundations
in it if you watch my unboxing blog you
saw where I got this like an unboxing
stuff it is so good and sturdy and it
has like two sides I don't know why I'm
showing it to you because it's not for
sale so I'll just stop right there I'm
done I'm sorry that was rude probably I
want to mention to you guys I did a full
review on this this is the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation which is their
new one not to be confused with their
old one I have a few full review it'll
be in the description box if you want to
check it out and know my other thoughts
on it I like demoed it out and all that
business but I really like the
foundation I wore it on set with lights
and cameras and stuff and it wore
beautifully on set it's heat proof
because I'm let me tell you the room I
was filming in with Neutrogena we had to
turn the air off because the air was
blowing in the background on the video
and so it's like 20 to 25 people in a
room besides my bedroom all windows open
sunshine coming in heat light like I
literally had a sweat mustache and this
stuff was just hanging on all day long
like it immaculate and I filmed three
video I mean it was like an all-day
thing and this stuff it was my best
friend it's been good and a lot of
people are asking me do I like the born
this way or this foundation better they
are so incredibly similar I don't have
an answer for that yet I will have an
answer for it just give me a minute
I don't know I still have to keep
wearing this longer late I don't know
that's like such a hard question that's
like asking me do I want pizza or
hamburgers both next I have to bring
this product up because Manny's new
lippy mani did such an amazing job on it
mani makeup artist this is serenity and
I love it so much I've been wearing a
non-stop I've been asked on somewhat
my lips serenity serenity serenity his
serenity amazing job with the color it's
gonna look beautiful and I miss every
skin tone you can wear it you can dress
it up you can wear it down I mean it's
just everything and I also have a
discount code for it for you can get all
three of their liquid lipsticks for $38
plus free shipping that discount code
will be in the description box check it
out next I want to talk to you guys
about an eyeliner which it's not
actually called
a high liner and people always say you
said high liner I'm like because it's
cold fine liner I swear I promise I'm
not lying
this is the mark-up Jacob's high liner
and this one is in black or it's a
liquor blacker blacker yeah why I bought
this $25 eyeliner whenever I have at
25,000 of them sitting right up there is
because none of them will stay in your
dadgum waterline huh talking it to young
law and polish nicole and beauty birdy
of Maine and they were like Laura you
have to get the market Jacobs High Line
that's the only one that's gonna stay in
your waterline and I bought it and it
wasn't even a lie like it was just the
pure truth even when I was checking out
the for the girls like oh best eyeliner
ever you're gonna love it
Boop $8,000 I have a blush I want to
mention to you guys and this is like a
brand new I think it's a brand new blush
from Sigma this one is called sweet
thing it's one of their summer
collections colour-pop collection this
lush it just looks it looks kind of
plain whenever you look at it but
whenever you actually swatch it it's
like this Bobbie pink with a peach
iridescent and a very faint sparkle to
it I just can't not wear this every day
of life I love it so much it's such a
beautiful blush and it's just in such
simple packaging and you wouldn't think
this just has such a power to it like
but it does it's gorgeous and it's
unique and I love it X is a brow product
that I have been using so much
it is the benefit gimme brow this
product has been around for a hot minute
it's nothing new I'm just on a late bus
I wear shade medium deep and the thing
that I like the most about this is the
fact that it has this
want to it and that the product is
actually the color your brows and I like
to once you put the product on your
brows it's not to stiffening or doesn't
harden them too much where it just looks
like you have Elmer's glue on your
eyebrows like your eyebrows still like
hair you know what I mean because
somehow gels is just like two more
products and then I'll stop this is
charity pot by lush
I love lush because they fight against
testing on animals that whenever you buy
the charity pot products they make no
profit of it a hundred percent of your
Percy's go to a charity and it goes to
the web of life foundation dotnet I
actually like the lotion that came in
this like it's like all melty now very
nice it's kind of a weird it smell like
baby powder almost kind of a weird
spelling lotion I like it cuz it's not
greasy but I wanted to mention it to you
guys mostly just because you know it's
for a good cause and a hundred percent
of it goes to the press goes to the
foundations I'll have it linked down
below so you guys can check it out and
see your thoughts on that actually I
have a facial primer that I have been
loving if you follow me on snapchat you
should be know that I love this Tarte
primer this is their clean slate
timeless primer and it makes your skin
baby smooth if you're having trouble
with fine lines and wrinkles big pores
you just need a smoothing out your skin
I would definitely give this stuff a try
it does feel a little bit it feels a
little bit silicone II based just a
heads-up on that if you're like your
local Sephora or old side I recommend
just giving it a little swatch and
filling it between your fingers and how
that's gonna feel on your face if you
have Olli skin I don't know that it's
gonna be your best friend but if you had
those fine lines and wrinkles and you
have those pores and you need something
to help you out with that I highly
recommend using this stuff under your
foundation it's gonna give you that soft
and smooth finish yes anyways that is it
for my favorites video guys I hope you
enjoyed I've had lots of new products
that I haven't really talked much about
on my channel and I'm just you know I
want to tell you about them because you
need to know about the good stuff
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you did enjoy I love you guys thank
you so much for coming by
follow me on my social media before you
leave I will see you in the next video
