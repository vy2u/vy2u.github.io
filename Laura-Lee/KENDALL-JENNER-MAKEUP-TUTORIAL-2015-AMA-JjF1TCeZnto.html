video is going to be this Kendall Jenner
look this she wore at the AMAs this year
a lot of you guys asked me to do a look
incorporating my bangs which these are
just clip-on extensions that I di dried
out of some old hair extensions that
were long so like they worked out
someone well for me I do love the
switch-up of the hair look so there's
just piece of hair right here they just
wants to get a shout out real quick cuz
he doesn't want to hang out with other
buddies Sam mm-hmm I don't know what
he's doing I love the log that eyes were
like somewhat subtle the lip was subtle
and then she had like this ball of
peachy bronze cheek and it was just go
just don't make it look anything like
handle and I have to have to just find
that because before gonna buy oh my god
you look nothing like her
not what I was trying to say what I was
trying to do is just recreate the makeup
look in the hair because I think it
looked fun hope you guys enjoyed the
video if you do give it a thumbs up I
would definitely appreciate that a whole
lot all right jumping right in we're
going in with this Marc Jacobs coconut
primer this is just a very moisturizing
primer so I like to put it all over my
face my face has hives all over it
because I picked on my face right before
I started filming which was one of my
non wise decisions next I'm gonna go in
with the Too Faced better than sex
foundation in the shade sand I'm gonna
blend that out with my Beauty Blender
also beauty blenders whenever they're
dampen which they should be if you're
using it they retain moisture into your
skin whenever you're pushing them into
your skin and this time of year I'm nice
and dry so I like to opt for my Beauty
Blender now I'm gonna fill in my brows I
have a full detailed brows tutorial I
will link down below if you really want
to see how I do the brows I'm just gonna
line them with the brow Wiz and then I
filled them in with a little bit of dip
brow pomade next I'll go in with a
little bit of creme brulee which is an
eye shadow by makeup geek cosmetics and
an eat
five brush from Sigma as you can see I'm
just blending this shade all through the
crease this is a very subtle shade so it
doesn't show up much but it's a nice
transition shade that I use I've been
using this more than Peach Smoothie just
like in every tutorial to soften up that
crease next I'll go in with this
traveller palette the world traveler
palette by honest Tasha and I'm gonna
grab Morocco I believe it's just a very
warm brown color I'm gonna pop that
right on top of creme brulee in the
crease this is just gonna give us a
little bit more of a deeper Brown look
but at the same time keep it nice warm
and toasty then I'll blend that out with
the e-40 brush from Sigma make sure
there's no sharp lines blend it out next
I'll go in with soft peach by Anastasia
you can go in with any cream color if
you want to pack it on to the lid now I
did cover my whole entire lid her eyes
were quite subtle besides the lashes I
mean I could barely tell that she had
much eyeshadow on and it did pretty much
look all matte now I'm gonna go in with
shimma shimma through through with
makeup geek I'm gonna pop that on the
brow bone just to give us a little live
truth be said you're not gonna be able
to see our brows or our hell bone with
the bangs but I'm gonna do it anyways
now I'm gonna create a very subtle thin
winged liner instead of my thick
dramatic
usual winged liner that could make me
fly away I am using my NYC liquid liner
which is one of my favorite drugstore
liners is like two dollars and it's the
bomb I actually struggled a little bit
creating a little baby wing I don't know
if I just haven't done it in a really
long time but I just struggled the
struggle was a little bit real and I was
turned off a little bit by how my wings
came out I'm not gonna lie to you now
I'll go in with the Hypnose drama
mascara from Lancome which I've been
liking but can we take a moment to look
as much as that curl and coat my lashes
the mascara they still grow out straight
like straight as a board so you came and
told it I have lashes
look at that isn't that sad okay don't
feel bad for me anyways I added on some
lashes which I will link down below
because I don't know the name of them
off the top of my head and now I'm gonna
highlight my face with my NARS creamy
radiant concealer and custard I really
like this shade because I feel like it's
not too bright not too dark and I really
love the brush that I'm using to blend
it out with because it's dome shaped and
it gets right in there in that eye
socket it just makes everything it's
seamless it does not play games it gets
the job done so this is like the f80
something I'll link it down below oh now
I'm going to take the new contour kit
from Tarte and I'm gonna use their
banana shade and I'm gonna just apply
this all over the areas that I highlight
it with the concealers and that way it
sets it it's gonna make it stay there
longer and not move them around then
I'll go in with the brown shades from
the contour kit and I'm not even really
contour my face I'm just trying to warm
it up give it a little color because my
skin is all one color basically from
doing the foundation now this is a
really important part with this look
it's the blush
she had like a big ball of peachy bronze
II blush on our cheek so I added peaches
by Mac and I'm gonna add a super subtle
highlight this is indiscretion by Laura
Mercier I'm gonna pop that on just kind
of all over to give me a slight glow but
I'm not really trying to like my
highlight be popping kind of situation
you know now I'll go back in with that
reddish brown color I'm gonna apply that
all over the lower lash line from inner
to outer corner this is a new brush for
me which I did enjoy using I don't know
the name of it I will link it down below
and then I went in with the chocolate
shade from this palette and I'm going to
apply that right really tight at those
lower lashes this is gonna smoke it out
just a wee bit and then I'll pop on a
few coats of mascara to my lower lash
line
next I'm going in with this lipstick
this is by kamila coho and Sigma Beauty
this is a really pretty pink shade and
her lips are super glossy so ended up
going in with butterscotch by Anastasia
Beverly Hills to pop right on top and to
lighten the lipstick a little bit more
and basically that's it for this look I
just popped on my bags and we are one
and done and I hope you guys enjoyed it
if you do please give me a thumbs up it
helps me out a lot and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
